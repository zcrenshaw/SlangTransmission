"TIFU by making a joke and losing the right to see my daughter


This just happened last week. I got home from working out of town Thursday night and my wife warns me that there is a problem with my 7 year old daughter. “Beth” comes in and I can see that she has a few bug bites on her face and and one of her eyelids is a little droopy. She feels fine though. 

I am off work the next day and my wife is going to the office. I wake Beth up for breakfast and her eye is now much worse. It is more than half closed and a little red. She still feels fine. As soon as the doctor opens, I call them and they tell us to come in.  

We get there and I go to check in. The receptionist that I have never seen looks at my daughter and says “Oh. My goodness, what happened?”  So I respond as a joke “Eh, she got out of line”.   

I know!  It’s horrible. I’m sorry!  I have a weird sense of humor and I’m a bit socially awkward.  Anyway, we all smile and giggle before we head to the waiting area.  Soon we are called in. The checkup goes as expected. It’s a reaction to the bug bites and he tells me to use some over the counter Zyrtec or Benadryl.  Then there is a knock on the door and the doctor steps out. 

He comes back in a few minutes later and says that the police would like to talk to me. The doctor is angry. We all head to the Doctor’s office to talk.  

There is a policeman and a policewoman. The policewoman starts making small talk with my daughter and asks if she wants to go in the other room and read a book. My daughter has an irrational fear of the police from when her older brother would threaten to call them whenever she went in his room.  So she says no and buries her face in my side.  The police then tell me that it is better that she is in another room. I saw one of Beth’s cheer coaches bring her son in soon after we got there and mention that she may still be there to watch her. The doctor, still visibly angry goes to check and she is so Beth goes to sit with her in the waiting room. 

The police explain that they have a report of possible child abuse. The Doctor explains that this was a simple misunderstanding. He just examined my daughter and there is no abuse.  I now realize that it is the receptionist that he is angry with.  She makes an excuse and leaves the room. He says that he thinks he has to let her go. He says this is the second incident in 2 weeks. He says that her bad judgement got his practice and the entire executive park closed for 4 hours last week and his neighbors now hate him. 

The police are apologetic but say they need to do a full investigation and ask if I can come to the station.  A friend comes to pick up my daughter who is freaking out at this point. 

We get to the station (they allow me to drive there myself) and my Uncle who is a lawyer meets me there.   The police are apologetic and say they already know what happened but a full investigation and report need to be done. They say it is a minimum of 3-5 days, maybe longer.  I call my wife who goes ballistic.  

The county attorney says that they normally seek restraining orders in these cases, but if I sign an agreement to stay away from my daughter until the investigation is closed they would not seek one. My uncle recommends this as the restraining order would be public record. I stay at my brothers for the weekend and schedule an out of town trip that I really don’t need to make for this week.  I can’t wait to get home to see my family and sleep in my own bed but I’m pretty sure my wife will have me on the couch for a little while.  

tl/dr:  Made a bad joke, got investigated for hitting my kid, lost the right to see her. Sitting in a hotel room on a useless business trip.

"TIFU by unintentionally betraying the trust of my new kitten. (NSFW)?


Obligatory, wasn't today, but 2 days ago.

So my gf and I adopted a new kitten a week ago. She's a very curious kitten, as many are and she always has to be wherever my girlfriend or I go. She also has very little concern for personal space so that also makes for some interesting moments.

Well my girlfriend was in the bathroom washing her face before bed, and I had to take a piss like a fire hydrant as I had been drinking some beers throughout the evening. So I went into the bathroom and began to pee. As I was standing there next to my girlfriend filling up the sparkling white bowl, with powerwasher type pressure, the sound of my piss splashing in the water suddenly disappeared and all I could hear was a sound that resembled water draining onto a carpeted floor. I looked down into my bowl of golden fury, and to my horror, the kitten was standing inside the toilet bowl with my stream of piss splashing off the back of her head. I started screaming ""OH FUCK!"" And managed to pinch off my stream. The kitten didnt seem to mind getting a wet via golden shower, but as soon as I pinched off my stream she bolted out of the toilet and started sprinting around our apartment. This all happened in a matter of seconds and my girlfriend was standing there, jaw on the floor, and began laughing hysterically yelling at me to go catch the cat.

It took me a few minutes to get our kitten cornered and grab her soaked, shaking little body and bring her back to the bathroom. I set her in the tub and I had to hold this piss covered feline still while my girlfriend sprayed her down with the shower head. I got her dried off and then she ran away from me and has since been very cautious whenever she comes anywhere near me. The last few nights I've woken up to her sitting on my chest, face to my face, and staring into my soul. I dont know what shes planning, but I'm sure she'll get her payback sooner or later.

My girlfriend thinks it's the funniest thing shes ever seen, but she's still a little salty that I pissed on our new kitten..

TL:DR - I gave my first and hopefully last, golden shower.... To my new kitten..."
"TIFU by burning 700 lbs of marijuana and getting half of the military high.


  

While overseas, one of the things we were charged with doing on a regular basis was disposing of insane amounts of illegal drugs. We usually were most concerned with the opium/poppy industry; however, a larger pot bust was enough to give us something to do. Typically, we would raid a compound and find a couple 100 lb sacks of ground marijuana. Enough pot for a lifetime. The pot fields grow wild out there, football fields in size, and 8-10 feet tall. Sometimes taller. It’s grown in a way that corn is grown in the civilized world, with irrigation and pesticides. It’s a remarkable sight. 

For those of you who have read my prior posts that mention marijuana use, I would like to clarify… I never touched the stuff overseas. Far too terrifying. They also mix pot with chicken poop and various other things so there’s another reason to steer clear.

Anyways, usually we just covered a couple hundred pounds of ground pot in diesel fuel, lit it on fire and went home. Far too risky to hang around and wait for it to burn. Well one day while searching a suspected HME (explosives) manufacturing house, we happened upon a room that had 7 or 8 100-pound bags (320 kg) of the sticky icky. If you know anything about pot, you know its fluffy. 700+ pounds was an absolute mountain. My mind reeled at how much money this would be worth back home. A literal fortune. This looked like The Hulk fell into a wood chipper. 

A genius counterpart suggested that we bring Mt. Kushamanjaro back to our base and burn it in our own burn pit, rather than leaving it here. 

“Well that’s a clever idea!” I thought, relieved that we wouldn’t have to risk getting ambushed with the biggest freaking smoke signal ever built. 

Ah but ambushed, we were. The bags were loaded into pickup trucks and driven back to the base, hastily sliced open and dumped into the burn pit. I ran the idea by our leadership and we had a thumbs up all around. 

&amp;#x200B;

The early effects weren’t bad. The smoke column went mostly straight up, however as it grew in size, it lazily pushed itself in the direction of the nearest guard tower, Tower 3. Jokes went around as we awaited the results. Coughing could be heard immediately and the private in Tower 3 called out to us: 

“Hey we need to…. We need to… do something… like… now?” I could hear the brain cells slowing with every word. 

This was a churchy type kid, having never been exposed to the sticky.

“Sergeant, I’m… I’m high as shit!” He yelled moments after. I panicked and sought a solution that would keep leadership out of it. 

“Someone, relieve him!” (genius)

Several individuals raced to take over Tower 3. We devised a plan for a 10-minute rotation until the wind subsided. How perfectly that column of smoke engulfed the tower was perplexing. Like a lazy pot-nado. Around this time our fire really kicked up as the wind shifted and grew in intensity... right in the direction of the command post, and subsequently Tower 2. Several high-ranking leaders came out, looking furious. 

“Who the hell approved this!!?” The First Sergeant yelled

“I believe you did..” The CO responded 

“Well where’s the detail that brought it in?” 

“That would be us First-Sergeant” Myself and a couple others. I thought back to the decision-making process and realized that I had a ton of responsibility in the matter. In fact, I was *really worried.* Abnormally concerned… I felt myself stammering over words, felt my heart begin to race, kept thinking “ohjesusohjesusohjesus I’m going to get caught...!” It was in that moment that I realized, I was sketching. I was proper baked, and not handling my shit well. 

I turned around and just sort of, left the conversation. My leaders did not need to see me drool. I hazily walked back toward Tower 3, ground zero, to find a dozen or so soldiers laying in each other’s laps, goofing off, and having a ‘deep philosophical conversation’ about a bug’s journey through life.

Inert.

I wrote Tower 3 off as combat ineffective and wondered toward Tower 2 to see if I could help, a big stupid smile on my face. They seemed to be in better shape however were arguing about how long each should have to be in the tower. Apparently, the concept of time was no longer a thing. I started to address the issue with a random sergeant in the area, but we got side tracked in conversation about the effects of diesel fuel mixed with the pot. We theorized something stupid about how the diesel fuel had longer to soak in the smoke, and that it was causing the anger among the Tower 2 crew.

I assume the wind was completely dead now, as I remember the whole compound being covered in a light haze. [**Here**](https://imgur.com/a/LVZQg8F) is a crude blueprint (greenprint?) of the above narrative.

At this point I thought it would be best to find a snack and wondered to our dining tent to see what was up. Here I was reunited with half my squad. Instead of relishing in the moment, there was a trouble cloud over our heads, and I could tell we were all pretending to be perfectly fine. Minus a couple phantom giggles, we did a pretty good job getting through a meal. 

Although I was personally quite effected, I think someone put the fire out, and a few hours later it was business as usual. A lot of stories flew around for months about the leadership getting high and what not. I did not personally see it. I came from ground zero, saw the leaders and returned to ground zero where I belonged. I theorize that my leaders took the same approach of handling it without involving their bosses. No repercussions followed.

 

TL;DR – Tried to burn a bunch of contraband, the wind shifted and the contraband burned us. "
"TIFU by orgasming so hard I broke my vagina.


TIFU by orgasming so hard I broke my vagina

Happened a couple of days ago, as is tradition. Throwaway because some IRL folks know my normal handle on here.


So a couple of months ago my doctor put my on a new SSRI to help with my chronic depression. It didn't work that well and made me super-dazed, and on top of that my sex drive dried up to a level that can only be described as ""Sahara-like."" Now, it's not like I'm in a relationship or anything, but I still enjoyed getting off at least a couple times a week, and found myself very wound up without my normal release.


I told my doctor that the medication just kind of put me in a fog, so she switched me to an SNRI and holy horniness my sex drive came back with a vengeance. After work one day, I came home and decided to treat myself to a round or two with my vibrator, to celebrate. Well, it had been building up so long in me that I went to town and had one of the most intense orgasms of my life. I should note at this point that I didn't use lube, because I was so..worked up..I figured I didn't need it.


Sounds great, right? Eh..not so much, because right after finishing the deed, I realized I had a shooting pain in my vagina, like I had badly pulled a muscle. After spending a couple of minutes laying in state, praying to every god and deity out there to make the pain subside, I made the long, labored waddle to the toilet, only to realize I was dripping a lot of blood, too. 


Before you ask, no, it was not shark week for me, so needless to say, I was surprised. Upon further inspection, I realized that I not only pulled a muscle deep in my lady parts that had me walking funny for a day, I suffered a vaginal tear due to my..vigor..as well. However, it was a lot more blood than any little tears I had had in the past, and prior to this, I had never had a tear from masturbating, so I was convinced I really badly injured myself, and may need stitches.


I called my OB's office and made an appointment, and I explained what happened, all while turning shade of purple that Barney the dinosaur would envy. My doctor took a look and welp, I was right, I needed stitches, and instructed me that the future during any particularly-intense sessions, I should probably use lube, just to be safe. Ironically, now I now have to once again abstain from all sexual activity for a period of time, so I'm back to square one. 


Needless to say, the whole experience was not what I was expecting, and has been something I would prefer to not experience, ever again.


TL;DR Got super horny, overdid it during a solo session, and broke my vagina."
"TIFU by having a spider in my shower and accidentally creating a gas chamber


This happened about 40min ago. Also for context, I live in Australia, and have arachnophobia from a traumatic childhood experience involving floodwaters. 

As of tomorrow, I am going to be away from home, on an 8 day film shoot across the east coast of NSW. Each day is about a 14 hour day. Naturally, I decided to have a nice long relaxing shower before I left. 

About 4 mins into my planned 25min shower, I was midway through shampooing my hair when I felt something. Like a sixth sense something-ain’t-quite-right-here type of something. I look up above me, and to my HORROR, a black, eight-legged, piece-of-shit, shower-ruining, house spider dropping down its web towards me via the air vent.

Australian children are taught very young to stay away from spiders. It’s common knowledge that the black ones can cause extreme pain, seizures, death, so I know my daycare teachers would be proud seeing my 6’2, 91kg, naked male body glide through my sliding shower doors and onto the tile floor, covered in shampoo.

They’d be extra proud of me, without thinking, grabbing the toxic insect spray, and proceeding to blast the shower and spider, with a fallout cloud that would rival the scene from T2: Judgement Day. 

They would NOT be proud of me, however, of being so paranoid about seeing the spider die, that I stood in the enclosed, steamy room, inhaling the fumes to see it. It wasn’t until I realised my eyes were watering and I could smell a stinging sensation that I realised I had unintentionally gassed myself. 

So my naked, wet, bloodshot-eyed, dumbass attempted to run out of the bathroom, to escape dying via ALDI cheap bug spray. Attempted, because I then proceeded to trip over where the bathroom tile meets the kitchen tile, and promptly give myself a bloody nose. In the nude.

I have checked the label and the poison assures me the symptoms I experienced are the worst it’ll get. My nose is ok, the bleeding has stopped. And yes, the spider is dead.

TL;DR spider attacked, sprayed poison in the shower. Poison got in my face, fell over and gave myself a blood nose attempting to escape. "
"TIFU by stabbing my boyfriend with an EpiPen


Okay, so obligatory 'this wasn't actually today' disclaimer, but this did happen on Saturday. However, because my boyfriend actively uses reddit and will most likely see this, I figured I'd do the respectful thing and wait two days before I posted this super flattering story.

Some important details to keep in mind:
1. my boyfriend is deathly allergic to peanuts and has been since he was just a wee child.
2. I'm a dumbass.

So, this past weekend marked our one-year anniversary, which is a huge feat in and of itself given detail #2 spelled out above. To celebrate, we decided to go out for a super fancy dinner -- the ol' OG Olive Garden.

Being a fourth-year student at university, I've gotten very used to not wearing makeup, but I decided to go all out for our anniversary dinner. I even went out and bought a lip-plumping gloss so my bf could pretend he was dating a Kardashian for the day instead of plain old u/kate_plus_self_hate. Supposedly, the gloss works by searing your lips until they are huge, red, numb, and possibly burned to the first degree -- needless to say, i was unpleasant to use but I still thought it was worth it.

Fast forward to my boyfriend picking me up and us detouring to an empty parking lot for a quick-ish makeout sesh. An hour later, we arrived at Olive Garden and started in on the unlimited soup, salad, and breadsticks. We're maybe 15 minutes into dinner, and my bf starts complaining that his lips are tingling and that he feels kind of funny. I think nothing of it at first, but as we keep eating, he says the feeling was getting more intense and was spreading to his neck, abdomen, and **nervous glance** his nether regions.

My first thought was that he was hamming things up, but after a few minutes I could tell he wasn't faking anything. My next logical thought was that our food had come in contact with peanuts and that he was starting to have an allergic reaction. He agreed because he couldn't think of any other reason he would be experiencing the symptoms that he was.

At this point, I'm starting to freak out -- I don't want to be responsible for killing the only human who voluntarily spends time with me -- so I take my bf's keys and race out to his car. I knew he kept an emergency EpiPen in his glove box, so I fished that out, ran back into the restaurant, and jammed that fucker into his thigh.

Fast forwarding one more time, I flagged down our waiter to pay for our check, rushed my bf back out to his car, and drove like a maniac to the closest open urgent care facility. The practitioner there ran tests for his white blood cell counts and all of that fun shit, after which she told him that he's just fine and that none of their tests came back that he was having an allergic reaction. She asked him if he had come into contact with anything that might have been irritating his skin...

...and that's when my last two functioning brain cells decided to start working. The whole thing was my fault. The only possible explanation for the whole ordeal was that I got my probably-FDA-rejected lip plumping gloss all over my boyfriend's body.

My bf was less than enthused when we got home and I told him what I thought had happened. In fact, he made me throw the gloss out immediately. A few hours later, he (and my own lips) was back to normal, but at least this makes for an anniversary we won't forget...

TL;DR: I mistook my getting lip plumping gloss all over my boyfriend for him dying from a peanut allergy."
"TIFU by googling symptoms of a brain aneurysm during work.


This actually just happened a couple of hours ago. I'm a math TA at my college, and I was working my weekly shift. Nobody had come in for help, so I was pretty bored all night long. I also have a cold, so I had been blowing my nose pretty frequently throughout the shift.

There were about 30 minutes left in my shift, and I could feel my nose about to drip. I was out of kleenex, so I got up to grab a napkin from the corner. As I'm blowing my nose, I feel a weird feeling in my head. Immediately, I recalled a family friend of mine who had a brain aneurysm triggered by blowing her nose. I know it's ridiculous (which I'm realizing even more as I type this out), but because that's what my head immediately went to, I just had to know what the symptoms of a brain aneurysm might be.

I did a Google search, and the first thing I read was ""An unruptured aneurysm usually causes no symptoms."" Now, I'm someone who gets queasy at anything medical like this, but this was a new record. After reading this, I thought to myself ""oh fuck"", and then proceeded to tunnel-vision. My last thought was ""shit I think I'm gonna fain---""

Next thing I know I was being helped across the room by another TA in the room, and I had no idea what had happened yet. As I get to the other side of the room, another TA comes in with a medical student (the med college was in the same building), and this guy asks me to lay down on the ground. He asks me to lay down on the ground, and that's when I notice my hand covered in blood. I start to panic, and when I try to sit up, I immediately started to tunnel-vision again, so I quickly put my head back down to keep from fainting again. Then they covered my brow with paper towel, which indicated to me where I hit my head. I was asked questions such as ""what day is it today"" and ""who is our president,"" both of which I knew.

Overall it was a wild series of events. EMTs were called, and ambulance was sent to my location. A few friends of mine were in the building, and they came to make sure I was okay. After ten minutes or so I felt fine aside from being a little shaky after everything had happened, and a hospital stretcher was brought in. *Shit* I thought, as I know how much an ambulance trip costs and idk jack shit about my family's health insurance policy. To make matters worse, half of the people in the room thought I should go to the ER to make sure everything was okay, and the other half told me that I was fine and didn't need it. Still in shock, I opted not to go, and I've felt fine ever since aside from a bit of a headache from hitting my head.

After everything went down, my understanding is that I fell out of my chair and hit my head on the wheel of a table in the room. I was out for about 20 seconds, and I clearly scared the living shit out of the other TAs that were there. Overall though, I was very impressed with how the situation was handled. The other TAs were quick to get multiple sources of help, and the med student had arrived by the time I came to. He was very knowledgeable and was able to replicate many of the questions the EMT had asked me when he got there. I'm just glad to say that I wasn't alone when I fainted, otherwise I might not still be here. Anyways, I'll probably will be taking the day to relax tomorrow.

TL;DR: Felt a unique feeling in my head after blowing my nose, googled brain aneurysm symptoms, and got queasy and fainted. Hit my head hard on the wheel of a table and almost got sent to the ER."
"TIFU by pooping into a large Gatorade bottle


[You want it Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/9fgkdi/tifu_by_drilling_my_6_year_old_in_the_face_hail/), you got it- 

&amp;#x200B;

This happened a few years ago while on guard tower duty in Afghanistan. I had contracted a heinous string of dissentary and virtually all liquid entroduced to my body was being expelled violently. 

So there I was, 40 lbs of body armor, helmet, the whole army guy get-up. I was on a 6 hour shift in a guard tower, alone with nothing but my thoughts and my creative organs. As expected, a fierce gurgling sensation begins inside of me. It starts at the peak of my intestines and rumbles down to my core like a Carolina Thunderstorm. As the post title implies; IT WAS GO TIME. 

I realized there was absolutely no way I could wait for a relief person to take over, much less deblouse my entire kit before making it rain on deez hoes. I looked around frantically at what I had to work with; Sandbags, machine gun, gatorade bottle. 

*Well I could slit a sandbag open, I could unload/disassemble the machine gun and use the barrel as a conduit of sorts... perhaps flow it into the sandbag?* 

Nope, no time. My body interrupts with a gurgle that would give Florence a double take. I snatch the Gatorade bottle (mind you, this is like a 40 ouncer) drop my pants and take refuge against the wall. I wasn't particularly sure of the logistics at this point, but a squatting position seemed best for time and practicality. NO TIME. I know this is a tough target. World class, Olympian level, and I get **one shot**. Mom's spaghetti. 

I go for a full contact technique, pressing the bottle hard against my orifice and let loose. Instant relief as I feel the bottle begin to gain weight. 

Nailed it. Just have to stick the landing. Get the cap on and we all go home safe right? 

WRONG! .. Turns out, there was a **critical** scientific principle I was playing with here. I never would have thought in the moment, but this device needed to breathe. With the air trapped inside the bottle, as you introduce more volume into the bottle, it pressurizes, and continues to pressurize as more volume is introduced. Pretty soon I felt the bottle get considerably hard. Unfortunately I was lost in buttgasm land without a care in the world. 

I was sitting atop a steaming pressure cooker moments from eruption, oblivious to the situation I put myself in. 

A few short seconds later and it was game over. A stray bullet cracked in the distance and caused me to jostle slightly. That slight movement gave my little bomb the perfect direction of travel; ***POOM!*** \- up and out. 

Now, the problem wasn't so bad in the beginning. I got back-splash on all of my undercarriage, my hand, and my gear. This problem was immediately perpetuated however, by me *DROPPING THE FRIGGIN BOTTLE.* 

Of course it has a dramatic splash effect, hits nearly every sand bag as well as the gun mounted in the tower. Of course with all supplies listed above, the only option I had was to start slitting sand bags to use as war-wipes. 

&amp;#x200B;

Thank goodness I still had 4 hours to kill.

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR - Pooped in a bottle, made a poo-bomb, dropped it and made a mess. "
