"TIFU by not taking off my Apple Watch or disabling the 911 feature and accidentally called police while i was handcuffed and being spanked by my husband and the police heard me screaming.


To begin, I'm a female BDSM practitioner. I enjoy it, and I won't apologize. (Edit: That came out harsh. Sorry!)

My husband often cuffs and whips me, and on Wednesday we had a pretty hardcore session. He put these big leather cuffs on me, but failed to take off my Apple Watch. I didn't realize that if you hold the dial down, it automatically dials 911. 

So we get into it, and he's spanking me and I'm pulling on my restraints, and the restraints hold down the button. Hes smacking me pretty good, and suddenly I hear from my watch ""Ma'am, I hear what appears to be hitting and screaming. We are sending someone to you. Hold tight."" 

""Did you call 911???"" My husband asked, ""tell them it was an accident!!""

So I tell the 911 operator that it was just an accident, and she says is your name [She said my name here]? And I say yes... And she says ""we have your address from our database, and we're sending someone over now. Im sorry, but we hear a male voice telling you what to say, and this sounds like coercion on our end, so we are obligated to make sure you're safe.

I said okay thank you, and I hung up.

""The police are coming.""

Shit. I'm literally covered in bruises and welts, the police are coming to check on my well being. Within a few minutes there's a stern knock at the door. We put our clothes on and come to the door, and the police take my husband outside, separating us from communication.

I calmly explain that it was an accident and we were just having really crazy sex. I didn't mention the spanking.

Apparently my husband did. Another police officer comes in and asks about our BDSM contract. ""He told you about our contract?""

""He felt it best to come clean about your extracurricular activities tonight, and thought the contract would possibly show State of Mind.""

I go get our contract and showed it to the officers. After a mortifying few more minutes explaining that he was only smacking my ass and thighs, they believe us and tell us to disable the 911 feature on the Apple Watch if we're going to do that again.

TL;DR TIFU by accidentally calling 911 during a heavy BDSM session and they heard me screaming and sent the police.

Edit: Mods asked me to repost on weekend. 
Edit: iWatch doesn't exist. &lt;3
Edit: Yes, this really happened."
"TIFU by moving in next door to a drug dealer


I posted this in r/casualuk yesterday and it went down pretty well, and a couple of posters convinced me to post it here. pologies if this is overkill and you'e already read it! And honestly, I don't know if it qualifies as a TIFU, so I am sure the mods will decide. Be gentle, mods...  Anyway, story pasted below... 
  
I may have over-egged the detail, so this story is quite long. The detail is pretty accurate, cos I made notes immediately after the event, and I've tried really hard to be honest and not embellish too much!
  
On the first day of moving into my new house back in April of 2015, my neighbour came to introduce himself - and it wasn't long before I deduced that he was in the drug-dealing business. I initially thought that wasn't so bad, I like a smoke from time to time and having him next door could be useful. Even if I went back in time right now to warn myself, there's no way I could convey how wrong I was... 
  
Now 2015 was otherwise known as the worst year of my life. It certainly wasn’t what Back To The Future had let me to expect. 
  
After losing my dad to cancer, my sister having a miscarriage and my BBQ exploding on my birthday gathering, I was beginning to think my luck would have to turn soon. It was August, the summer was ending and nothing bad had happened for two whole months…
  
I’d been up late watching It Follows, and not being much of a horror fan, I was suitably creeped out. And slightly high. My girlfriend had come home late from a work function and had gone straight to bed, and at about 12.30am I went up there too.
  
It’s probably worth explaining that this house has three floors. The ground floor has an entrance, spare room and stairs, the first floor is the kitchen and living room, and the top floor is the bedroom and bathroom. It’s one of three houses in a little mews in a leafy Sussex village.
  
I went to bed and was soon drifting off. About 15 minutes later I heard some banging. I didn’t pay it much mind, assuming that watching a horror movie before bed had made me oversensitive. So I started to go back to sleep. The next memory I have is of shouting. Lots of shouting. The bedroom door burst open, and a group of large figures stormed in, brandishing crowbars.
  
I remember screaming in that way you try to in a dream, when nothing comes out. I also recall spinning around slightly so as to block my girlfriend, an incredibly sweet and innocent creature who had barely witnessed a crime in her life. I thrust out my legs, kicking one of them in the crown jewels firmly. This led the ring leader to crack me on the legs with a crowbar, telling me in no uncertain terms to not do that again.
  
So now there are at least four men lined up alongside my side of the bed. Maybe five. Hard to tell, I didn't get to put my glasses on. My girlfriend is screaming, they’re all shouting, and I’m incredibly confused. The ringleader then demands that I give him the bag of money.
  
“What money!?” I asked.
  
“Give us the fucking bag of money, we know you’ve got the bag of money!” the ringleader repeats. Several times.
  
“I don’t have a bag of money,” I explained. It’s hard to remember the order of events, but I do know one thing for sure - Tom Cruise popped into my head.
  
The previous night I was watching Mission: Impossible 3. I do like that film, and I had it on in the background while I did the washing up. I remember pondering the scene where Ethan Hunt’s wife has a gun to her head. “I want to give you what you want, but you’ve got to do what’s right!” exclaimed Hunt. Hmmm. I wonder if the screenwriter had researched this dialogue. Is this what you are supposed to say in a hostage crisis?
  
Well, it apparently sewed a seed, because I found myself repeating those words.
  
“I don’t have a bag of money. I want to get you what you want, but you have to do what’s right and leave this poor girl alone,” are the words that came, strangely confidently, out of my mouth.
  
“Yeah? Well we know you sold drugs to my daughter!” said the one I considered to be the sidekick.
  
“Nah nah nah, it was my sister,” said the ringleader in correction.
  
This exchange told me two things - one, they did not have a particularly good grasp of what their plan was, and two, they were after my neighbour.
  
For my neighbour is a drug-dealing maniac. A weird guy from Essex. He’s in his mid-30s, about 5’8” with light blonde hair and eyebrows to match. He’s skinny and zany, usually hopping from one foot to the other as he tries to keep his excessive energy in check. He smokes weed from 7am, and boxes on his outdoor punchbag whenever the weed isn’t enough to keep his energy in check.
  
Sometimes he can be seen in the communal car park making things. [Like the time he made a wooden triangle](https://i.imgur.com/2E6FGuw.jpg). Or he juggles balls with his dogs, or he shadow boxes. You know, the usual things you expect to see your neighbour doing at literally any hour of the day or night. 
  
Still, realising that the intruders were in the wrong house, I wasn’t entirely keen on sending them next door. As much as I disliked my neighbour, I didn’t think he deserved a group of masked men storming in. So I continued to try and talk these people out of the house.
  
“I’m not a drug dealer, so I’ve no idea what you’re talking about. There’s a couple of Macbooks downstairs, sixty quid in my wallet, an iMac… whatever you want, just take it and go mate.”
  
Hearing this offer, the ringleader realised I was being compliant. And if I was willing to give up a few grands worth of computers, why wouldn’t I just give him the bag of money he was seeking? Slowly, the cogs turned.
  
“Is this number 27?” he demanded to know.
  
“The whole area is.”
  
“Yeah but is this number two, twenty seven Acacia Avenue?”
  
“No, it’s number one.”
  
“WE’VE GOT THE WRONG HOUSE!”
  
The realisation was startling. They all shouted. One guy had been searching every room, cupboard and drawer. He had given up already. One or two of the others went down stairs to get him, leaving me and my GF with the ringleader and his sidekick, a guy I suspected was far darker in soul than the guy doing all the talking.
  
“Right, you can’t call the cops or we’ll come back. We know where you live!” The sidekick said.
  
Emboldened by the realisation that these guys were morons, I laughed. “You seriously think I won’t call the cops? Best I can do is give you a thirty second head start.”
  
He didn’t like that, so he took my phone. Good, I thought. I’ll track that fucker. Sadly, I later discovered, he threw it behind my sofa on his way out of the house.
  
The ringleader then apologised. He said they were looking for someone else, and there had been a mix up. I said something along the lines of “well I am glad we sorted that out.” At which point he shook my hand, told me he hoped my GF would be ok, and forced the sidekick to leave with him.
  
I picked up the bed and jammed it against the door, and enveloped my traumatised girlfriend in a big hug and told her it was over. Which it almost was.
  
Little did we know, the morons had decided to try again, this time knocking my neighbour's door in and storming his house. But he was in the kitchen, so they went flying past him, up to the bedroom where they found his girlfriend. My neighbour, being the kind of guy he is, then jumped out of the window, abandoned his GF, ran to my front door and stormed into my home.
  
“THE-GO-KID! THE-GO-KID! THERE ARE PEOPLE IN MY HOUSE!” He screamed.
  
“No shit,” I responded. “Why do you think my fucking door is wide open?”
    
I went out to meet him while talking to the police on my GF’s phone. He grabbed a knife from my kitchen, the phone from my hand, and went after them. I decided I was done, went back to enjoy the barricade of the bedroom.
  
It took the police a while to turn up, because the genius neighbour of mine told them they had guns, so we had to wait for armed response. Eventually, my GF and I cautiously walked down to the living room. The police eventually arrived, but they knew it was too late. So they stood outside our houses having a chat and a bit of a laugh. It’s likely to be the only time I tell four men with machine guns to shut the fuck up.
  
The rest of the night was a mess of police as they took statements, searched for evidence and quizzed my neighbour about, yes, the bag of money. They were convinced they could bust him for something, as they had wanted to for some time. Turns out he had broken his foot when he leapt from the window, and so he was carted off in an ambulance. As the stretcher went past me in the car park, he tried to talk to me.
  
“Go Kid! I just want to say one thing mate! I just want to say one thing!” He screamed.
  
“Neighbour, you’re not physically capable of saying just one thing.”
  
The police, who knew him all too well, erupted in laughter. This humiliation would haunt him for some time.
  
Eventually I heard that my neighbour had claimed it was all because of an instagram picture he had posted on Facebook, and he thought he knew the ringleader. A scumbag he’d recently connected with on FB. He gave the police two weeks to charge the guy. To the credit of the police, they arrested him but didn’t have the evidence to charge him.
  
About a month later, my neighbour beckoned me into his garage where he remonstrated with me for blaming him for the ordeal. “They terrorised us too!” he said. He then told me he had taken matters into his own hands, dealing with the ringleader himself, putting him in some sort of box and, I presume, torturing him. He tried to show me some sort of video evidence but I refused to look at it. ""We have to look after our women!"" he said.
  
He then said that he was aware I had reacted like a pussy when the guys got into my room. A bit bemused by this, I asked him if it was more gutless to scream or to jump out a window and leave my partner behind. This enraged him, and we haven't spoken a single word to each other since.
  
The only stuff that was stolen was money from our wallets and my Leatherman (it had 'That's not a knife' engraved in it). Nobody was ever charged with the break-in and eventually life went back to normal, albeit with a very expensive new front door. I moved house this year, so I can only hope I never see my neighbour's face again.
  
 I know some people find this story entirely unbelievable, but [it would appear I’ve got back-up on that front](https://ol.reddit.com/r/CasualUK/comments/9ey4pe/i_endured_the_most_english_home_invasion_ever/e5tap79/) as one of the responding officers is on Reddit and confirmed the story's validity on my original post! 
  
TL:DR - Masked men broke in, stormed my bedroom, realised they got the wrong house, said sorry and broke into next door instead. Also, my neighbour is a knob."
"TIFU by drilling my 6 year old in the face, Hail Mary style.


 

Ever throw something and know the very instant it left your hand that the throw was good..? sensational even?

&amp;#x200B;

Last week while being lazy, trying to nap like a good ""dad on duty"" should, I experienced just that. I heard a scream come from my 4 year old's room.. I slothily carried myself to the commotion to find him in a pool of tears, screaming that his older brother had thrown a toy through the window from outside and hit him in the face.

*""Pretty good throw""* I thought to myself as I peeked out the window, my adrenal glands starting to kick some dust off.

""CHILD's NAME"" I yell, my smug little 6 year old is jogging across our field, trying to act inconspicuous.

**""DO NOT. THROW TOYS. AT YOUR BROTHER!""**

The following actions I took were inexplicable. I grabbed the small hard (HARD) plastic butterfly, perhaps out of frustration, or dad-mode protection, and beamed it back out the window, in the general direction of my running 6 year old. Surely without the intent of hitting him, perhaps just to show my frustration? A million year old instinct to assert my dominance? I could never make a shot like that. Not in a thousand tries. He was at least 40 meters away, running perpendicular to me, his smug, older brother face looking in my direction, as if I didn't know what he had done. I would never be able to beam a moving smugface like that, too many variables.

*By god* as it rolled off the tip of my finger. I knew. IT WAS *GOOD*.

I knew before it left my hand, I knew mid-stroke, hell; I knew before breakfast yesterday. My son was getting drilled.

&amp;#x200B;

Before that toy left my fingers, I saw police, handcuffs, search warrants. I saw my courtroom, a stern judge and an unforgiving jury. No posted bail. No commissary. A life sentence. Supervised visits in 20 years if I'm lucky. I saw my whole life pass me in an instant, I looked through the crowd for a friendly face, none to be found. Not even my best friend, my wife, was there to support me. I felt that throw for a lifetime.

&amp;#x200B;

Fast forward a half a stroke and I Knew. *Jesus I* ***knew. IT. IS. GOOD.***

&amp;#x200B;

The smell of the turf, the cheering crowd, the stadium lights. Last 10 seconds of the game, 3 points down on the 10 yard line. I spent all season playing catch on the sideline, waiting for the starter to get injured. Now was my shot. A hail Mary, 80 yard play is our only chance. I beam the ball with all my might and I knew. I feel the outer body euphoria when you just *KNOW.* The ball sails to its target, the crowd knows now too, they go wild, game over! Home team wins the championship!

&amp;#x200B;

He knows as well. He knows better than I do. His life is over. In that split instant we had a conversation, he and I:

*Why Dad, why?*

***Because. You don't. Throw toys. At your brother.***

*But dad, I promise I'm sorry okay? please don't do it daddy...!*

***It's too late for that son. I already pulled the trigger. You're done and you know it.***

His bottom lip trembles as he realizes I'm right. No more second chances. Game over. Dad wins. He's taking that plastic butterfly to the forehead, dead center, and nothing can change it.

&amp;#x200B;

3/4 throw and I'm in the VIP room later that evening, feet kicked up, sipping top shelf champagne, surrounded by teammates, close friends and women on either side. My post game press conference is playing on the TV, along with the highlight reel. I laugh at how stupid I look in a suit. Who cares. I AM THE VIP. I'll be damned if I spend another season on the sidelines. They shall rue the day they sidelined me. It crosses my mind that I may have made the best throw i*n history. I KNEW.*

&amp;#x200B;

Suddenly several security guards come in through the beaded doorway, along with two police officers. All official and serious looking.

The head of security approaches me, deep concern consumes his face. He hastily presents a cell phone to me, a hand over the receiver portion, to mask our words.

&amp;#x200B;

""Hey kid, remember that toy you threw?""

""***How could I forget... The whole world remembers!""***

""Well.. your wife is on the phone, and she is not happy....""

&amp;#x200B;

I take the phone, although fear filled the room, I walked not in fear, She would understand. She too would love the VIP.

&amp;#x200B;

""*ARE YOU OUT OF YOUR FRIGGIN MIND?! WHAT DID YOU DO TO ZANDIPUS?!""*

""***Babe, babe, babe.. let me just say; I have an amazing story to tell you....""***

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR - Threw a dense plastic toy a ridiculous distance in the direction of my kid.. gave his face a schoolin."
"TIFU by thinking my hoodie string was a parasitic anal worm


So today I was hanging out at my neighbors house just talking and getting to know each other. They're pretty chill and I really felt like this would lead to a great friendship.

After a couple hours of banter I started feeling my gate to the nether weakening and I knew it was time to go make a deposit into the toilet so I politely asked to go to the bathroom, a completely normal thing to do right?

They informed me that the light in there was broken so I was just like whatever I'll use my phone as a flashlight to make sure no brown substances were remaining on my crevice.

I go in there and Im just going through the routine, browsing reddit, trying to make my bowel movements quiet as possible, yall know the drill. However once I reached the wiping phase, my life changed.

I commenced the first wipe like usual, checked it out with the light, I knew I'd definitely need to do some more rounds. After a few wipes, the scariest moment of my life occured.

My flashlight lit up the toilet paper and what I saw made me feel fear unimaginable by the human psyche until felt firsthand. I saw a black snake like creature wrapped around my hand, and my brain immediately thought I was infected with some kinda anal superworm.

I let out a bloodcurling shriek. One that you'd hear in the depths of hell. In my instinct driven spasm I somehow broke the toilet seat and my ass fell into the fucking toilet. I was in a primal state I can't even explain. I was desperately flaying my body around like a dying fish trying to find this ass demon but I couldn't find it anywhere.

My neighbors were extremely worried thinking I was dying of a heart attack/seizure/stroke in their bathroom, but I didn't give two shits. My inards were being harvested by some kinda alien species, why the fuck would I care what they think?

After about 45 seconds of searching for the little shit I started coming to my senses. If there really was something living in my anus, where the fuck did it go? Then I looked down, and felt the worst embarrassment in my entire life.

The black, slithering, slimy, snake like worm wasn't a parasite, it was my hoodie string. I just destroyed my neighbor's toliet, screamed caveman like shouts, and threw my body around like a retarded octopus, over a fucking hoodie string.

My neighbor's concerned voice turned into a ""WHAT THE FUCK ARE YOU DOING IN THERE???"" At this point and I was speechless. I tried to muster up some kind of explanation but I could only mutter ""Im...Im so...sor....sorry."" I was scared to open the door, but I knew it had to be done.

I opened it to see the faces of a family that won a free trip to a zoo, but got tricked into going to an insane asylum. They just stared at me. I just stared back while covered in shit water and a face of a man who survived the Holocaust.

I didn't know what to say so I just muttered ""I'll see myself out."" and they didn't even respond. I silently waddled out the door and walked to my house with a broken soul.

I feel terrible. I broke their toilet and obviously need to compensate them for the damages, but I dont know if I can ever see them again without having horrible flashbacks. I truly am a lost man. I will never be the same.

TL;DR I thought my hoodie string was a parasite from my anus and broke my neighbors toliet."
"TIFU by uploading my old exams on the internet.


So this all happened in June, and I’m only writing about it now because the situation just got solved.

As the broke college student I am I found a website that offered me money for my notes about classes and old exams that I have taken, extremely simply procedure that consists of simply uploading PDFs on the web, categorizing them, and then getting a payment on my paypal. I think “Great! I make money and I can help kids seeing what to expect on the exam by seeing the old ones”. 

The fact that I scanned all my exams and kept them in my Google Drive to have them as possible study material made the whole process easier. I upload 5 documents from my Organic Chemistry class and get paid $25, I figure that I might as well do it for all the classes, more money to buy alcohol you know?

In the span of a couple days I upload about 120 documents for subjects such as OChem, Physics, Calculus that span from old exams to notes to summaries about the whole class, pretty much my old study materials. I get a couple hundred bucks and go buy my, at the time, well deserved booze.

Fast forward a month, and I have just given all my finals, got my 4.0 this term and I am happily preparing to go back home. I wake up one morning with an email from my email professor informing me that due to the content I uploaded he is gonna fail me in the class even if I passed it with an A. 
I immediately panic, I start freaking out.
To make matters worse, I get an email from my Physics professor with the same exact content, failing the class even though I passed it.

Now I am actually freaking the fuck out, I am an international student in the US so now I’m scared my visa is gonna get cancelled and that I am a dead man.

Next day I receive an email from the Director of Student Affairs asking to meet me to discuss the question. I’m hoping he will just give me a slap on the wrist and tell me to not do it again. I meet him and after a two hour meeting he informs me that most likely I will be expelled from the school, not allowing me to enroll at the university I was transferring to and ultimately revoking my visa. I get home and have an absolute breakdown, I can’t tell my parents because they will fucking disown me so I have this weight on my back that’s literally killing me. 

However, the decision wasn’t final so the Director asks to meet me again the next week. Every day that passes it becomes worse. I don’t know what to do with myself, my girlfriend (the only girl I truly loved) graduates and breaks up with me. I have so much shit going one that I start having suicidal thoughts, I am at the lowest point of my life (I’ve been lucky enough to never have experienced any real problems).
The day comes and the fucking Director tells me that he will not give me a final decision today and that he will contact me via email, due to the fact that I am leaving to go back to my home country and won’t be in the States to personally see him.

I fly back home, and after approximately three days I get an email informing me that I have been suspended for the summer term, I have a 2500 word paper about Academic Integrity and my GPA has been lowered to a 1.0 for the term. However, I will be able to transfer to the University I was planning to go and I will get to keep my academic scholarship. 
Additionally, I have to write a paper of 2500 words about academic integrity that includes interview to two professors along with some other assignments that will be communicated me later.

Fast forward a couple of months and I am currently on a plane flying towards my new college, with a hue weight off my shoulders.


tl;dr I uploaded old college exams on the internet, went from a 4.0 to a 1.0 for the term, nearly got expelled and deported. "
"TIFU by not locking the bathroom door


tl;dr at bottom

So I'm a mom and as I'm sure most of you know,  a kid's favorite time to bug you is when you're trying to do anything for yourself. I always lock the bathroom door when I'm in there but for some reason last night I decided, ""Meh."" I'm in the shower and of course here walks in my 7yr old blah blah blahing. She finally leaves and when she does she leaves the damn door open. So when I get out I normally stand on my bath mat and dry off but I wanted to shut the door so I step over to shut it and when I step back I slip on the wet tile. My leg bends in, I hear a pop and it goes jelly-fied. I fall hitting my ass on my toilet (my fucking tailbone hurts like a bitch today.) then roll off onto the floor. Starting yelling oh fuck and my kids run in. Ask them to bring my phone and call EMS because I can't move. Then I get incredibly nauseous and pass out. EMS shows up, helps me to my couch, and checks me out. Offered to drive me to the hospital but I figure they have people that need them more than I do so I wait for my mom to come get me. Fucking torn ACL. Wtf. Now I'm looking at possible surgery and months of rehab all because I didn't lock the fucking door..

tl;dr Didn't lock the bathroom door so my kid came in and left it open. Slipped tearing my acl and now possibly need surgery and tons of rehab."
"TIFU by almost being sex trafficked


This actually happened over the summer, when I was studying abroad in Germany. Sometime mid July. I'll also be honest up-front, I don't have proof that this was an attempted abduction, because I got away at the end. It's nevertheless clear that there were sinister motivations, so the ""best"" possible situation was an attempted date rape.

At the end of the semester, I traveled around a bit with my (now ex) boyfriend, who was also in Germany for a summer job, but lived in a different city than me. One place I REALLY wanted to go was Trier, the oldest city in Germany, so he and I booked train tickets and planned to meet there for a weekend. Unfortunately, it turned out that Trier wasn't much of a destination (even though I thought it was super cool), so the only train my boyfriend could get would have him arrive at 1am on Friday night, whereas my train got into town at about 3 in the afternoon. No big deal, though, I figured just see some sights on my own and stay up to let him into the hotel when he got there. 

At about 9pm on that Friday, I was done walking around but it was still light out (summertime) and the main square was still really hopping with people out for the evening, so I decided that I'd buy a beer from a grocery store (yes, I'm super cheap) and just sit on one of the benches in the square enjoying the atmosphere before heading back to the hotel for the night. So far, so good. 

I'm sitting in the square sipping my beer, and this maybe mid-30s guys starts chatting with me in English because he's Pakistani. This isn't so unusual, since the whole ""backpacking across Europe"" thing is still sort of a thing, so young travelers often chat with each other in my experience. I'm kind of uncomfortable at this point, but that's just because I'm an awkward introvert who hates talking to strangers. The whole time we're talking, I'm kind of thinking *""wow, I can't wait for this conversation to end so I can go back to the hotel and Reddit""*. 

Once I finish my drink, though, he notices and asks if I'd like to go to a bar and get a drink. I'm a total homebody who doesn't do things like go to bars with strange men, so I decline, but eventually he persuades me to move to an outdoor table at a street-side cafe. *Ok,* I think, *I've got plenty of time before my boyfriend gets here. I'll have one soda pop and then excuse myself.*

Nope. As soon as the waitress comes over, before I can open my mouth, the guy orders two beers- one for each of us. Still, two drinks isn't much. I knew I could more than handle it, and I decided I'd accept the one drink, but no more (not to mention I don't like Pilsners, which is what he ordered. Hefe-Weizen for life.) We're chatting, and he asks if I'm alone in Trier or with friends, so I say that I'm with a ""friend"", meaning my boyfriend. He immediately follows with asking if this ""friend"" is male or female, and seems disappointed when I say male. (Yes, in hindsight I should have said ""boyfriend"", but remember that this boyfriend is now my *ex*, as mentioned above, and at this point we were already on course to break up, so it wasn't quite so cut-and-dry what we ""were"".) However, this may have been what saved me later.

After we finish the beers, he starts complaining that the cafe isn't showing the world cup game, even though Germany was playing that night. I should have excused myself then, but he convinced me to move out of the main square to a side street and to sit down at another outdoor cafe where we can see a TV screen. Again, he immediately orders me a beer. 

Now I'm going into my third drink in less than an hour, which is more than I care to drink alone in a strange city with a strange man. When the waitress arrives and gives us our glasses, he immediately started saying that he was going to order us both shots as well! This is where I put my foot down... except he ignores that. Despite me saying ""no"" to the shots multiple times, he got up and went to find the waitress to order the shots, probably so that I *couldn't tell her that I didn't want one*. 

Now it's really clear that he's trying to get me drunk, and I really don't want to be drunk. Again, yes, hindsight is 20/20. I should have taken his absence from the table as my opportunity to disappear, but I'm an idiot. A lot of why I didn't leave is because he didn't really do anything ""wrong"", if that makes sense? He didn't make lewd comments or grab me or anything- the only ""wrong"" thing he was doing was being very persuasive and then ignoring my protests against more drinks. Otherwise, he was very friendly and polite, so out of a desire to also be polite, I stayed. Ladies: learn from my mistake, and DON'T STAY IN SITUATIONS LIKE THIS JUST TO BE POLITE. 

Even though I stayed at the table, I'm not a *complete* moron, so while I was alone, I dumped half of my beer into the potted plant next to me. I'm really not sure if he noticed, because he didn't say anything about it, but the plant was still fizzing when he returned... oops.

Now we've got two shots in front of us and partially drunk beers. I finish both and run in to the bathroom (that's a 1.5liters in an hour and a half... I was bursting at the seams), only to return to find out he'd ordered us both another beer in my absence. This beer is now the 5th drink of the evening, and would put the volume of liquid at 2 liters. That's hella beer, and I was really struggling to even drink it. 

While I'm super slowly sipping my beer, the guy started getting phone calls every few minutes. Now, I mentioned he was Pakistani before because that's relevant now. I couldn't understand the calls because he was speaking Urdu on the phone, but it was clear that someone was impatient with him and wanted him to hurry up, especially since they kept calling back over and over. He said it was some friends asking him to come hang out. Eventually, he got tired of waiting for me to finish my beer (I was REALLY struggling to drink it), so he says ""forget the beer, let's go."" He pays the tab and we start walking down the side street. 

Now it's about 10:30pm. It's dark. I decided to myself that one way or another, I would be gone and headed back to the hotel at 10:45. 

While we're walking through the streets of Trier, an older Pakistani man suddenly comes up to us. His uncle, apparently, who speaks no German or English. I shake his hand and greet him anyway, then the guy stepped in between me and his uncle, so that I couldn't see what they were doing... but I could hear the sound of paper money being exchanged and counted. Then the guy said ""thanks"", and we kept walking. 

After a little bit, we come to a hookah bar. The guy has been smoking cigarettes all evening, which is also pretty normal in Europe, but I have never smoked in my life and I don't want to start (I can't stand the smell), so I'd declined his offers of cigarettes. Now he's trying to persuade me to go into the hookah bar (where his ""friends"" who'd been calling him are) and smoke a hookah and have another drink. Nope. I glance at my watch, and it's 10:45, when I promised myself I'd leave no matter what. 

So I begin to say that I couldn't *possibly* stay and smoke a hookah because my (boy)friend's train would be in at 11, and I said I'd be there to meet him (which is complete BS- he wouldn't arrive for another two hours). I'm super clear that there's a man expecting me very shortly, which gets him to finally back off (weird how that works), then I quickly walk away. Once I'm around the corner, I broke into a run for a bit to make sure I wasn't being followed, then found my way back to the main square and then to my hotel, where I collapsed on my bed. Everything was swirling around me because of the booze, and the first thing my boyfriend said when he saw me 2 hours later was ""...are you drunk?""

&amp;#x200B;

**TL;DR** \- I was an idiot and let a stranger get me drunk while I was alone at a bar in a foreign country, and he may have tried to sell me to a middle-aged man, but I ran away right before I walked into what was potentially a trap where his ""friends"" were waiting. *Never ever stay in a situation where you're uncomfortable just to be polite!*"
"TIFU by going to work on an empty stomach and no sleep


LTL, FTP. Format is chaotic because I’m on mobile. This happened today, etc etc. 

After a sleepless night that I can only chalk up to changing my sleeping schedule for my new job, and also because I wanted to watch Seinfeld more than I wanted to sleep. I dragged myself out of bed for the most absurd shift of my life. Oh, and I skipped breakfast because I’m an idiot. At this point of morning I’ve been awake for about 20 hours.

I started my new job at a green grocer’s a few days ago. It’s a nice place, easygoing, solid clientele. The woman who is training me is 35 weeks pregnant and going on her maternity leave tomorrow. We’ll call her ‘S’. All morning S is talking to me about how excited she is to finally have a couple of weeks to herself. No work, no baby, just her and her couch. S started talking about how the baby felt kinda odd today, and I’m falling in and out of sleep while standing (about 28 hours awake at this rate) and start craving bacon and eggs. I’m willing to give my life for bacon and eggs. That’s unimportant, but I wanted to briefly talk about the last nice thing I thought about before chaos ensued. 

We’re talking about how to cash up and close the store when suddenly S says 
“oh”, and then she says “oooOOOH”. I’m not properly registering anything at this rate and am facing the register so I figure she’s bumped her knee or something. More casually than you should EVER ask a pregnant woman, I say “you all good?” 

Silence. 

“Uh, yeah, I think I’m okay. That was weird. Anyway, what you next have to do is - OH OH WHAT!” S has put her hands on her stomach and finally my idiot dial clicks from ‘oblivious moron’ over to ‘semi-aware dickhead’. This lady is in labour. I’m 23, and while I may be a woman myself I have no idea what the fuck to do so I start scrambling for the store owner who shouts “CALL THE AMBULANCE, I’LL CALL HER HUSBAND”. The sudden yelling from the manager, the contraction screams in the background, the bacon and eggs, and the customers witnessing the scene all set off some abominable reaction in my brain and the next thing I know I’m on the ground with the store’s owner (M) leaning over me and instructing an onlooker to call a second ambulance. 

Anyway, things are a bit hazy here. I end up in the hospital on a drip with a doctor asking me a million questions. Eventually I’m released with one of those hospital sandwiches and a prescription to ‘rest up’. Finally I make my way home, eat my sandwich, take a nap, and am now preparing myself for the embarrassment I’ll no doubt face when I walk in to my shift tomorrow. 

TL;DR: no sleep + no eat = passing out in the middle of your shift after realising that your coworker has gone in to labour. 

Disclaimer: I don’t have any updates on S so if you feel like asking, I unfortunately can’t help out right now. I just hope she’s doing well! "
