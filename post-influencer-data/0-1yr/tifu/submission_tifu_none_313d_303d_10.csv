"TIFU by taking laxatives willy nilly [NSFW]


So this post has tmi, which is why Im using a throwaway. Sorry guys but I need someone to know my pain.

The past few weeks, Ive been having trouble going to the bathroom. I went to a doc and everything it had gotten so bad. He didnt hear any sounds in me when he listened and got concerned. Took some x rays, all it showed was I was possibly constipated and MAYBE I MIGHT have unobstructing kidney stones (they couldnt tell). Anyhoo, not very helpful. So I picked up a box of laxatives and was like, alright time to fix this. I took 1 and it worked great. No problems.

Now tonight, and all week really, Ive had problems again. Nausea, lack of appetite, and of course trouble using the bathroom. So I figure, ""it helped last time. Why not?"" And I did it again.

Now, here I sit on the loo praying for death as I sweat so badly and am feeling such bad cramps. And Im not even using the bathroom! Just a bunch of pain, gurgling, and praying for death. Dont use laxatives willy nilly guys. Dont make my mistake. May the angel of death take me soon and end my suffering.

TL;DR: I willy nilly used a laxative and now Im sitting on the toilet hoping for death and its not even working."
"TIFU by not pushing for a suspicious mole to be biopsied


This actually happened a few times over the course of several years, most recently in December of 2015. I had a mole on my upper left arm that was raised and bubbly in places, shades of brown and peach (my natural skin tone) in different spots, and changed over time. I showed it to doctors at various clinics when I went in for other reasons. Each doctor looked, insisted it was nothing to worry about, and refused to biopsy it. I placed too much faith in them and didn’t push as hard as I could have. I didn’t want to be difficult.

Well, fast forward and I’ve had a pretty upset stomach off and on since May of this year. I went to the hospital and was told it was probably a stomach bug. I was sent home with anti nausea medicine. Then, in October, my belly became swollen and firm. I did enough googling to work myself into a fit of anxiety and after days of phone tag with gastroenterology at the hospital, I decided to go to the emergency room. I thought I was only going for the sake of assuaging my anxiety. 

Finally, I was in good hands. The proper tests were done, and on October 29th I was diagnosed with stage 4 melanoma that has spread to my brain, liver, and other organs.

The suspicious mole was finally biopsied and removed last week. It tested positive for melanoma. We believe it’s where the cancer started. 

TL;DR I failed to be my own best advocate for my health, and now I have stage 4 cancer.

"TIFU by allowing my child to play in a safe play area


Not today, but a couple of years ago:

We booked a week-long vacation at an all-inclusive resort in Jamaica. Total cost, with airfare, around $4,500USD. It was just myself, my wife, and our then-5-year-old son. Side note: Skeptically purchased travel insurance because our travel agent heartily recommended it.

Anticipation of the trip grew over the months leading up to the trip. Day of trip, we get up at 5AM and head to the airport for our 8AM flight. We arrive, check our bags, and go through security. Son was extremely excited to use his for-real passport for the first time, and fly in an airplane for the first time.

We make our way out to the gate area, stop at a cafe for a coffee and a breakfast sandwich. We're very early, with an hour and a half to kill before our flight. Luckily, there's a play area for children just next to our gate, which we of course allow our son to play in. There's a few other kids in there playing, some of them on our flight. The playroom is all padded, no sharp angles, padded furniture....100% safe, right? *Y'all haven't met my son.*

My wife asks me to watch our son while she goes to the shop next door for some ibuprofen to take with us. She leaves, and I'm left idly gazing at my phone while our son plays. I hear a loud THUMP, and the sound of other children playing goes very quiet, very quickly....and suddenly I hear my son scream. And he wasn't just crying his frustrated cry, this was his full on OH MY GOD DADDY SOMETHING IS VERY WRONG cry. I look over and he's getting up off the floor, and runs over to me screaming, clutching his right arm. 

I put him up on a nearby cabinet and feel his arm, all the while asking him to tell me what happened. He says ""I BROKE MY ARM DADDY! IT'S BROKE!"" Meanwhile, I'm feeling his arm....and it bends in a place where it shouldn't bend, halfway between his wrist and elbow. And when it does, he screams even louder. It's broken, all right.

I somehow miraculously manage to hold his arm stably while retrieving my phone from my pants pocket...and unlocking it....and dialing my wife. My wife, who never picks up her phone when I call, actually answers. I tell her in a terse, but even tone: ""You need to get back here. Now."" (The way she tells it, she just thought I was calling because our flight was boarding - which it now was - but then realized the tone I spoke with, and started running toward the playroom.)

She walked in, I told her what had happened - and she went to the gate, told the agent there was an emergency and to call 911. And to let them know we would not be boarding.

So instead of his first airplane ride, my son got his first ambulance ride. His arm was not just broken, it was BROKEN - both the radius and the ulna, in a very nasty break that very nearly required surgery to put back together. He was in a cast for eight weeks and in a brace for another nine months. The way he tells it, he was trying to balance on top of a cylindrical padded seat ""like a circus clown!"". And when he fell, he put out his arm, and snapped it.

It took around six months, but we eventually did get 80% of our vacation spend back - because of that vacation insurance. *Always buy the vacation insurance.*

TL;DR: Let kid play in safe play area at airport before a vacation. Kid broke arm, vacation cancelled."
"TIFU by sending my W-9 to 900 people at the apartment complex where I work


I've worked for an apartment complex for the last 2 years. We ended up getting bought out a couple of months ago and the new management company requested an updated copy of our W-9s. Easy enough, I figured I'd just do it today since most of the tours were scheduled for the afternoon.

I sat down to send out an email to all of the tenants regarding a parking lot closure for re-striping. Started as I always do with the group ""Tenants"", made a subject regarding the closure, then I get a phone call. After 10 minutes, I get a walk-in and get them scheduled for an appointment. During the walk-in, the other person in the office says she got an email reminding her about our W-9s. 

Once the walk-in is out the door, I open a new tab and type in the HR address for the new management company for a new email. Then the phone calls start and more people come into the office for various things. 2 hours pass and it's almost lunch.

Without thinking, I get back into my email tab (the wrong one), upload my W-9 and put into the body ""W-9 attached"" and send it. 

About 20 minutes later I get a phone call from one of the tenants. ""Hi is this reallyfdupthistime? I'm a resident at (place where I work) and it looks like you accidentally sent me a tax form, did you mean to send that to someone else.""

""..........yes""

And it was about at that point that I knew something had gone terribly wrong. To my horror, I looked back at the tabs and sure as shit, I had sent my W-9 to everyone under the tenant list with a subject about a closed parking lot. Got a few more phone calls this afternoon about it and sent my W-9 to the right email address.

Not sure exactly how bad IFU but I would imagine pretty horribly.

TL;DR I sent my tax information to everyone who lives at the apartment complex where I work."
"TIFU by catching a snake and disrupting military operations.


I'll go ahead and spoil the ending before I get your hopes up for some sort of military invasion. The disruption was a Navy medical officer demanding safety meetings so we ""don't play with the wildlife"".

Almost a decade ago, I was deployed to Iraq, and ended up on some big excavation project that had us spending a good bit of time pushing around dirt. Two of my Marines discovered a snake while moving some equipment. One of them was a self-proclaimed nature guide or something and wasn't concerned about getting bit because ""it doesn't look poisonous by the shape of its head"". I didn't trust him to leave it alone (he was already playing around with it), and I didn't want it slinking around our site for later mishap.

I figured I would catch the snake, and felt pretty confident to do so. As a kid, my uncle and I would hunt and catch live rattlesnakes. I didn't think this would be any big deal. Plus, ""me big tough MARINE!"".

I caught it without issue, but rather than throwing it over the berm, I came up with the bright idea of sliding him into a plastic water bottle and delivering him to my staff sergeant. He was a little guy, so I slid him in tail first, put the cap over his nose, and gave him a quick push. I figured his mouth was too small to get his fangs into the curved inside of the bottle, cut him some air holes, and set off to find the boss.

I dropped my snake-in-a-bottle onto my staff NCO's desk, proudly informing him that I had another item to add to the project's operational risk assessment. His response of ""cool"" turned into ""oh shit, that thing is alive"". He dismissed me and promptly set off to escalate my novelty through the chain of command.

Fast forward a week or two... The battalion medical officer found out about some of her Marines playing with one of the most deadly, adolescent, vipers in the world. Turns out she had a prior experience caring for a snake bite victim, and was overly aware of the amount of pain and agony that a human could experience on the long flight to Germany for antivenom. She called a battalion-wide medical standdown briefing, and proceeded to helicopter to a dozen different bases in Iraq, pulling Marines out of field duties, relating her story, and essentially telling us ""don't play with the wildlife!""

Last week I saw a Reddit AMA by a professional snake catcher. It turns out that some snakes have the ability to pierce their fangs through thier own skin to bite any sucker who thought they were safe holding them just behind the head. I then realized just how much TIFA.



TL;DR: I caught an adolescent snake that happened to be one of the most deadly vipers in Iraq, put it in a bottle, and set it on my boss's desk. He escalated it, and the battallion medical officer spent the next month flying around Iraq and disrupting unit operations to tell us ""don't play with the wildlife!""

"TIFU by going to a new barber.


So... I usually cut my own hair. Been doing it for years. Do a decent job.

I have to meet new clients, important clients, rich clients.

Figured I should get a nice professional haircut.

The place I used to go to was closed, so there was new hipster type barber shop that just opened a little while ago so I decided to give it a try even though it cost 20$ more than the usual place.

Tell the guy I want a hard part like I usually get. He starts washing and cutting, turns me so my back is to the mirror so he can start trimming the front. I feel him using a razor on my part like normal... Then not like normal I feel a huge stroke of the razor.... I'm nervous.

As he slowly turns me back towards the mirror [the horror](https://imgur.com/gallery/vEgLaSG.) was obvious.

Why the fuck would anyone want this, I've never seen this hair cut. And it's certainly never been given to me when I asked for a hard part.

I'm sad.

TL:DR; I'm a barber meme. Gimme dat isosceles. Gotchu Fam."
