"TIFU by finding a flashdrive and looking what was on it.


I found a flashdrive in my home and was curious as to what was on it. I put it in the computer and find folders full of family pictures and a video. It was blurred in the thumbnail, so OF COURSE i have to play it. 

It all happened so fast.

I see a dick. A hard, throbbing cock, staring me right in the eye.

And then it's cumming.  

And after the last bit of cum drops, the camera gets aimed downward and I see my dad's shoes and the tile in our bathroom. 
I just watched my dad shoot his fucking load all over the bathroom tile. This dude filmed himself cumming in the bathroom. 

He moved out a long time ago and obviously forgot that this flashdrive was here. I'm not going to give it back. I'm not going to assert dominance and return the favor. I'm going to burn it with fucking fire. 

TL;DR: I met my siblings today."
"TIFU by being funnier than my SO and allowing her to post it on reddit.


This happened last night/the wee hours of this morning. 

Last night while my SO was at work, she asked me to pick up tampons on my way home. She is a bartender and didn’t want to stop at a store or gas station late night when she got off. 

Me, being a guy, completely forgets until about 30 minutes until she is scheduled to get off work. So I jump in the truck and haul ass to the nearest 24 hour mega store. 

While I’m making my journey, I decide to roll the windows down and blast some music to enjoy the summer air. I’m in a pretty great mood. I had the day off and my SO was about to be off and we had plans to binge watch some New Girl. 

My journey into town is about a 35 minute drive down a road with literally no streetlights and no buildings. Just open desert. So while admiring the full moon, my mind starts to wander. “What can I do to add a little romance to this situation? Cover the bed in some dove chocolates? Maybe some flowers?” 

I make it to the store, retrieve the items, and start my trek back home. 

Finally I decide, “Nah, romance isn’t nearly as great as comedy.” So when I get home, I break open the box and spell out “Anal?” on the bed with the tampons. 

SO gets home and goes straight to the room to change. I follow her in seconds later and find her on the floor laughing. 

She takes a picture, posts it on r/funny (her second post ever) and it blows up. Now she won’t stop teasing me about having more karma and how she is “famous”. 

I’ve created a monster. 

TLDR; Spelled out “Anal?” with my SO’s tampons. She thought it was funny and posted it on reddit. Reddit agreed and now she thinks she’s famous and is holding her new found karma over my head."
"TIFU by instead of sucking the dick, the dick suck me


Today my cousin bought an 8 inch black realistic suction cup dildo as a birthday present for my brother, whom in horror discarded the obscene dingus. Being the saint that I am, I adopted this orphaned device. 

My friend and I provided the poor discarded ornament with a purpose, I replaced the toilet roll holder with our new trinket, which worked fabulously. 

However, the mere potential of comical joy to be experienced was wasted on such a mundane destiny, and thus I proceeded to stick the suction end to my forehead and become the unicorn I was meant to be... I had reached my comical peak. As we cackled at the flailing 8 inch dick upon my forehead I could feel something was terribly wrong. 

I heard a loud squelching pop as the large appendage detached, my friend looked at me in horror. Upon my forehead I had been crested with the biggest hickey possibly to have existed in the past millennia. The curse spot consists of a large darkening purple oval of approximately 6cm by 3cm. 

I leave for Italy in 8 hours for my summer holiday.... my friends won’t be able to look at me in the eyes. I fear for what the security at the airport may think of my battle wound. 

TL;DR: Stuck an 8-inch suction-cup dildo to my forehead, now left with giant hickey hours before I depart for Venice..."
"TIFU I said no to my Gf's proposal.


WARNING: THIS IS A LONG ONE. SCROLL DOWN TO THE TL;DR IF YOU DON'T WANT THE FULL STORY. 

Yeah... I f***ed up today. See, I've been dating my GF (K) for 5 years. We are deeply in love, we have pets together, we live together, etc. I've wanted to propose to her for about 2 years. The reason I haven't is that about 2 years ago, I got diagnosed with a rare disease and have been on and off several medications and chemotherapy. 

It's been VERY rough on the two of us, but K has stuck with  me every step of the way. My disease, GPA, is chronic, deadly when left alone, and tough to beat in my particular case. I'm starting drugs that haven't been FDA approved for my condition. All other typical forms of treatment have failed and things are kinda bleak, but not terrible just yet. This new drug is promising, but hasn't been guaranteed to work. I'm terrified to say the least. All of this medical stuff has prevented me from being able to go outside, let alone commit to anything serious. 

I want to be healthy and stable before I even think about marriage. I don't want to leave K as a widow with no support! K &amp; I had talked here and there about getting married, but had always come to the conclusion that I needed to go into remission first. We agreed to it, or so I thought. Flash foreword to a few hours ago and K is with MY family in a public restaurant, holding a ring and getting down on one knee. 

I saw my father, who has an extensive history of butting into my private affairs without asking to be involved, with his eyes wide and smiling. I immediately started freaking out. First thought: I haven't even gone into remission yet and I have no clue if I'm going to get better. I cannot get married and then hear that the drugs aren't working. What if I die from all of this? Second thought: GODDAMN IT DAD! Why do you always have to try and manipulate everything from behind the scenes?!

I guess I'm coming off as a bit of a brat here, but my Dad was a very involved parent when I was young. When I entered High-school, my father would play me up to college recruiters, my boss at the time, and to teachers. The expectations would get so high that I couldn't live up to them. Similar situations happened with friends and extended family as well. Both my brothers and I find this to be a real problem, if my Dad is left unchecked. I would go more in depth, but that is a post for another r/. Back to the story!

Anyway, I'm freaking out. I just start sputtering the first words that come out of my mouth. Sadly those words came out as a hodgepodge of ""no-nno waaay!"" With my heart beating out of my chest and a lump in my throat, I ran out of the building... I made the love of my life cry as I selfishly drove off and everyone in the restaurant dropped their jaws. I've never felt so ashamed in my life... After calming down, I talked to my Mother, and drove back to talk to K.

In the parking lot, without my family, we discussed what went down. Tears were shed and things were said. K told me I was being selfish. ""We've been dating for years, who cares if you die, I want to marry you!"" She also explained that the whole proposal was her idea, my dad had nothing to do with it. She understood why I would be paranoid about my dad though. K understands that my Dad has boundary issues and admitted that it would have been better if she didn't include them.

In the end, we reconciled. We made up, decided that I was being redicules and paranoid, and she wasn't forthcoming with her real feelings on marriage, engagement, and how my disease effects our relationship. We came to the conclusion that we should be engaged. We want to spend the rest of our lives together, no matter what the circumstances.

Now I'm engaged, still have no idea if my new drug is gonna save me, but if I do end up in an even worse place medically during it all, I'll be with my best friend/lover. K is my world, and I'm an idiot for ever considering not spending my life with her. 

Thanks for listening.



TL;DR
I said no when my GF proposed bc I'm on chemo and don't know if I'm gonna go into remission or die. Decided I was being stupid and reversed my idiotic decision to yes."
"TIFU by using the FaceApp everyone’s been raving about


So I guess this is a bit of a change from your normal TIFU posts but I felt like sharing anyways.

So this just happened like an hour ago. I’m sure you all have heard about the “revamping” of the FaceApp where you can literally age a photo of yourself. For those who don’t know what I’m talking about, [here](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.cbsnews.com/amp/news/faceapp-old-age-face-photographic-filter-mobile-app-development-russia/) is a good reference for you.

Anyways, so I saw someone post a picture to their Instagram and that’s how I heard about it. I knew I had to download it and try it out...because why not?

So I download the app, take a picture and set the filter. 

And OMG I’m totally old lol. It’s kinda crazy, and I’m not gonna lie...I look good as an old dude.

I decided to send the results with the original picture  to some friends and family who just die laughing at the filtered image. We start comparing pics and wonder if that’s how we will really look in the years to come.

Then a thought pops into my head...

Everyone tells me I look just like my dad, and if that’s true maybe he will get a kick out of this photo too! So I send it away!

...Nope.

He isn’t excited, and he isn’t laughing. He said it freaks him out.

I asked him why, and assured him it’s just a harmless filter.

What he said next broke my heart.

“I know I’ll never see you that old.”

TL;DR: I used the crazed FaceApp to send a photo of my old ass self to my dad, resulting in him being really sad and breaking my heart. Fuck."
"TIFU by accidentally putting mentos and diet coke in my mouth at the same time in a foreign country


Being half japanese, I take a trip to Japan every two years with my dad to visit relatives, sightseeing etc. Unfortunately I was never actually taught Japanese so having my dad there with me is super useful when I need assistance. On our trips my dad usually takes a day to go hangout with his old friends (we live in the US) and usually leaves me at our hotel or whatever. Today was one of those days. While laying in bed watching Pewdiepie’s minecraft videos I got quite hungry and thought to myself “I can go down to the convenience store and get some snacks by myself right?” Normally, yes. So I take a couple thousand yen that my dad left me and walk to the nearest family mart (for those of you who don’t know it’s a japanese convenience store.) I browse the shelves a bit and up buying a bento meal, mentos, and a diet coke. Checking out goes fine since I don’t really need to communicate, just hand over money. So as I walk back to my hotel in the middle of a crowded sidewalk my dumbass decided to pop a few mentos in my mouth just because. So I suck on those for a while and than without even thinking about the consequences I take a HUGE swig of diet coke, like so big that i can’t swallow all of it and it’s just sitting in my mouth. Than all of a sudden so feel a very weird foaming in my mouth. Than it hits me. I remember the experiments I did in elementary school, the crazy russian hacker vids, etc. That was the very moment I knew I fucked up. So before I can think literally anything else it’s foaming out of my mouth and I choke a little and end up just spewing out this diet coke foam. So obviously the people around me notice and come up to me and start speaking japanese. And of course I am sitting there, completely clueless. They were probably asking me if I needed help? I am dying of sheer embarrassment so I deadass just bolt back to my hotel with foam dripping down my face and clothes, im feeling sticky everywhere and life is not good. Once I get back to my hotel room and start to settle in I remember that I left my actual food on the sidewalk. So I just ended up starving until my dad came home and brought some leftovers. 

TL;DR: I mixed mentos and diet coke into my mouth in front of a bunch of people who didn’t speak the same language as me and sheer embarrassment ensued."
"TIFU by nearly twisting my dick off with a Fleshlight duct taped to an industrial fan.


Alright so this was a few weeks ago. I was going to post about it then but decided to see how things healed since I knew there would probably be questions. This is long but there was a lot too it sorry.

This began as many other bad ideas do, I had smoked some herb and was horny. My roommate was out of town for the day and I had the place to myself, figured I would take advantage of the rare opportunity and try to enjoy something more than just a speed fap. I pulled out the fleshlight that  I rarely use and started to get to work. I was at my computer but could not really get into it. Trying to operate the mouse and the fleshlight while lubed up was too cumbersome and it just felt like jacking off with more steps involved(the main reason I don't really use it). I pulled up some porn on my phone and tried to find a way to stuff the fleshlight between my mattress, and then in a shoe for a hands free experience but still was having trouble so gave up.  

Leaning over the bed my box fan was blowing on my bare ass so I went over too shut it off and that's when I got the idea. I took the front grill off and duct tape the back of the fleshlight too the center of the fan. Overwhelmed with anticipation of my new discovery I lubed up my boner, inserted it and turn on the fan. It felt extremely good but was not quite working, the fan was too weak and the friction was slowing it down nearly to a stop, I knew I was onto something and needed a bigger fan. Being walking distance from a Walmart I headed over.  

They had a couple to choose from I almost went with the biggest $140 drum fan since bigger seemed better(REALLY glad I didn’t) but instead opted for the $60 Industrial floor fan that seemed like It would be more than good enough for the job at hand. I also happened to pick up one of those stupid hands free phone supports that go around your neck so I could have the ultimate experience. At this point I couldn’t wait and basically power walked home with this giant box. I opened it up, took off the front grill and rigged it up the same way. Phone around my neck, looking like an idiot, I lubed up and inserted my dong.

What came next was pure heaven, this was legit one of the best things I have ever felt. The fleshlight was slightly off center so it almost made it vibrate while spinning. The vibration mixed with the spinning, the nubs in the fleshlight and manual thrusting in and out was insane. I tried the second speed but that was too much to handle. Just as I was really getting into it my phone began to ring, my sister was calling which she doesn’t normally do unless it’s important. I stopped the fan while still inserted and talked with her on the phone for around 5 minutes. After we finished the call I turned my video and then the fan back on.

This was my big mistake, at this point my meat was nearly flaccid but still stretched out a bit in the fleshlight. In order to secure it to the fan the bottom of the flesh light had to be completely tightened. The bottom usually has a release valve so you can control how much suction there is on the inside, completely tightened is maximum suction. Before I could even comprehend what was happening I felt some tightening and then a searing pain in my penis. My brain took me a second to process before I pulled my dick out and I literally saw it unwind in front of me. I’m uncertain how many times, was at least a couple and the sight of this along with the pain in my wiener caused me to black out. When I came too I shut off the fan which was still spinning and my shlong was feeling red hot. Panicking I just pranced around the gripping it. Other than being really red and shriveled in it looked fairly normal no rips that I could see. Being high and extremely embarrassed I grabbed some frozen vegetables, placed them on my rod and decided to wait it out a bit.  

The waiting was horrible but couple hours in everything seemed to be getting a bit better until I had too pee which just felt like lava dribbling from my shaft. At this point I was feeling more sober and drove myself too the urgent care where I was seen by a doctor and then directed to a urologist. I came clean since I wanted a proper diagnosis and you can imagine the reaction. Almost seemed like he was more disappointed in me with every question I answered. I was given a Cavernosography where they inject die into your cock before an X-ray to see if the vessels are damaged and an MRI. He said that  I may suffer some permanent damage from the penile torsion I was very scared waiting for the results.

That is the point I was originally going to write this but this is the update after 3 weeks. Everything came back good, the inflammation was likely causing the pain inside while urinating, the pain on the outside was from a friction burn, basically after me dick twisted as much as it could the fleshlight was still moving around it for a few rotations and gave me a burn across my whole dick. That has since cleared up and everything is back around 80%. Now that I’m getting boners again I’m honestly half temped to try again since it felt so good. Just remember if you try this to stay extremely hard and well lubricated the whole time.

TL;DR Was high and horny got the idea to duct tape a fleshlight to an industrial fan. Things went wrong when I turned it on with a flaccid penis. My dick twisted multiple times before I passed out. After seeing a urologist no permanent damage was incurred besides some inflammation and a friction burn on my entire shaft. Everything is feeling good again and may give it another go in the future."
"TIFU by falling asleep while tanning next to an attractive girl


There’s no obligatory “this didn’t happen today” because this happened a few hours ago and I’m still mortified.

I’m on holiday with family and on a cruise, we all decided it would be a great idea to go tanning after a long walk around the city we’re docked in. We went to the tanning area on the top deck and I split from my family as there wasn’t many beds free and I saw a bed open next to this really attractive girl who looks early 20s (same as me) and I think I could have a good shot here so I occupy that bed and make a few bits of chit chat until the tiredness from the walk kicks in and I completely deck out and fall asleep right there. I must’ve moved around a lot while asleep because I woke up 15 minutes later by a family member telling me to cover myself up as one of my balls was hanging out of my shorts. 

First thing I did was cover up then look to the side to see the girl is no longer there but probably saw just like everyone else who walked past in the 15 minutes. I’m on this ship another week and the embarrassment will live with me forever. Help.

TL;DR: fucked up my chances with a girl by my own nutsack that fell out while I was sleeping"
"TIFU by exposing myself to my wife's friend


This happened on Friday, and I'm just now able to relive it without experiencing Tourette-like outbursts of random noises and profanity from my extreme discomfort from the embarrassment.

I'm sitting on the toilet in the downstairs bathroom (which is right by the front door of our house), I have the door mostly closed, but it's not latched. Doorbell rings, my wife answers it, it's her friend Jen. Jen comes in the house. I should mention that Jen is a friend/neighbor we've known for just under a year and I don't really know her that well, which, for me, makes this worse.

I'm just finishing up, getting ready to wipe. I pull on the first piece of toilet paper, and as the toilet paper unrolls this big, and very fast spider comes running from behind the roll, brushing against my hand. Instinctively, I jump up and away from this spider, as I do this, the door to the bathroom opens, there's Jen, we both scream, me because my fight or flight (in this case flight) response automatically kicks in from my lizard brain thinking I'm getting attacked by this spider, and Jen seeing her friend's husband with his pants and underwear down between his legs leaping toward her screaming.

A lot of apologies and light uncomfortable laughter afterwards, and I haven't slept well since.

TL;DR: TIFU by exposing myself to my wife's friend when I jumped from a spider while sitting on the toilet, right when my wife's friend walked into the bathroom."
"TIFU by giving my boyfriend a morning BJ


Obviously this didn't happen today. I'm only now sort of over it so I decided to make a reddit post of it.

As the title suggests, I most definetely fucked up while trying to make my boyfriend live every man's dream (or so I thought).

It was like any weekday morning, my alarm rang at 6:30 to wake me up me in time to go to work. What was out of the ordinary about it was that I woke up a little before my alarm and couldn't get any sleep - so I decided to just begin my day and rolled over to look at my boyfriend.

His nose and forehead a little glowy from the good night's sleep, hair a perfect mess and bicep bulging from tucking his hand under the back of his neck, he looked really peaceful but also surprisingly sexy and that awoke the lady boner in me. I started to feel a little frisky and so I started to ponder the best way to wake him up.

I have to state that in the 1,5 years I've been with my boyfriend I've learned that he can be pretty cranky in the mornings. And I don't even mean like, before he gets his coffee he doesn't like to chit chat cranky, I mean like actually be pretty mean right when he wakes up and so usually I kinda just stay away from him until he's up and going. Somehow, now that I was in a horny state myself, I didn't really think twice of the morning crankyness, or at least I wasn't too concerned with it since I had come up with *the perfect way* to wake the love of my life up. I would give him the blow job of the century. And I would like to mention that he has previously stated it would be a nice surprise, which led me to think he wouldn't feel weird if he woke up to me actually doing it. I would never have done this if we hadn't talked about it beforehand.

So anyway I roll my way down the sheets, pull the cover off of him and sure thing, he was ""pitching his morning tent"". He hadn't woken up yet, so I carefully pulled his boxers down and started to do the deed.. only I was stopped maybe 3 seconds in by his knee that flew right at my right temple with force, almost knocking me unconscious and *definetely*shutting down all my thoughts about morning wham bamming.

After all the crying and running around for ice packs he told me it was super ticklish and that made him kick in reaction. He apologized but needless to say I will not be giving any surprise morning blow jobs any time soon, if ever.

TL;DR: Tried to be nice and wake my boyfriend up by giving him head, he was ticklish and kicked me in the face instead."
"TIFU by eating the green paste


This happened yesterday. I got sushi with this girl after finally getting the courage to ask her out. (To those out there going through the struggle of feeling like you can’t talk to someone you like, just do it. It’s nowhere near as big a deal as you’re thinking. Don’t be too proud to ask your friends for advice either.) 

Anyway, this is the first time in years that I’ve had sushi. Everything’s going well as we’re just talking about school until I’m so focused on what she’s saying that I pick up the tasty-looking green paste with my chopsticks without any thought to what it is. 

After I throw it in my mouth and start chewing, she pauses and asks, “Did you just eat that whole thing of wasabi?” 

I stop chewing as the spiciness kicks in, and I realize that I’m dumb as fuck. I figured it would’ve been gross if I just spit it out into a napkin right in-front of her so I keep chewing slowly instead. That doesn’t help, so I grab the salmon with my sticks and start eating it along with the wasabi so that the taste isn’t so bad. This doesn’t help at all either and she can see me struggling to maintain.

“Drink your tea.” She suggests.

“Ah yes! Liquids! They exist!” I think to myself. 

After this only somewhat helps, I just smile, point towards the restroom, and nod my head in hopes that I at least look cute while dying on the inside. 

The door’s fucking locked. 

After this I just swallow everything left, walk back to the table, and live with the flames inside my nose. The rest of the lunch was enjoyable though. Will probably jokingly ask her if she wants to go for some wasabi next time.

TL;DR: Wasabi. Never again."
"TIFU by accidentally ripping my butthole after lion king


TIFU when

Ok so I got back from the movies seeing lion king and I needed to shower but I’m also in a funk so I wanted to smoke and drink coffee so I thought let’s do a bath. 

Then I remembered I move out this week and I have like loads of excess bath products that it doesn’t make sense for me to move so I should just dump them all in the tub to generate some fantastical bubble wonderland. 


Wrong, 3 half conditionors, a bottle of Irish spring and like a bunch of shampoo do not make a bubble bath but it’s fine because it smells nice and I like the bubbles that are there. 


However, 


I went to get out and I stepped on the mat to drip for a second but I really wanted my coffee which was on the counter (dumb fuck me for not putting it closer to the tub) 

so anyway I take a small step on the shitty college apartment tile and fucking boom I slid so hard and I do a split and slammed my foot into the door which would have really hurt if my fat ass didn’t transform into a fucking bouncy ball launching me back up only to slide slideways this time knocking my cooter on the floor corner of the sink counter. 

At first I couldn’t tell if I was bleeding but looks like it’s just a poo stain and severe bruising from the sole fact my ass just bent in ways Gumby couldn’t even do stamping a skid mark on the tile. 


Fuck me for trying to have a relaxing day 

TLDR I ripped my butthole and pooed on the floor after being depressed about the new lion king by slipping on the floor after a soppy bath"
"TIFU by telling my fiance i'm the chad of my friend group


So about 15 minutes ago i decide to go on discord with my fiance in the room. She asks why my nickname is CHAD MEAT, to which i try explain that i'm the only person in a serious relationship in that server. To try and explain what a chad means i stupidly decide to go onto urban dictionary. What originally was a minor brag quickly turned sour, the search results under chad were ""the space between the balls and the arsehole"", "" a friendless loser that smells like a donkey"" and ""a meth-headed redneck"". Obviously she begins to curl up laughing at the fact that she thinks my ""friends"" hate me and gang up on me. She's continually asking me if i'm alright and need a hug, whilst i'm sitting here contemplating my existence.  


TL;DR Told my fiance my friends think i'm a chad, proceeded to get humiliated by Urban Dictionary."
"TIFU by sitting on my Right Testicle and blacking out because of the pain.


TL:DR ls is the title.


It was a average summer vacation day, I woke up late ate breakfast, blah blah blah, then I made a Nutella Milkshake (which is actually REALLY tasty) and went to sit down on the living room chair. That’s when disaster struck. I don’t really know how and why, probably the angle I was about to sit on, but I sat on my right testicle. The pain was insane. I jumped off the chair and started walking out, in pain. Suddenly I had black spot clouding my eyes and the next thing I know, I’m on the floor with my milkshake over me and my mom screaming. I blacked out for a few seconds and honestly it was the scariest few seconds of my life. I had a pounding headache but at least my right testicle didn’t hurt anymore! I’m fine now, and my mother calmed down before calling the ambulance. That was the first time I ever blacked out and I honestly was really scared."
"TIFU by simply walking into mordor


This actually happened quite a few years ago. Back when they were filming mordor scenes from the lord of the rings in Tongariro national park, New Zealand. I happened to be on vacation in New Zealand. Being a massive lord of the rings fan of decided to go check it out but instead of just looking from where I was allowed like a normal person I put a reflector vest on and simply walked in. For about 10 minutes I strolled around set like I belonged there and no one questioned me (I said a casual hi to Aragon when I walked past him) But just as I was getting ready to leave a security guard asked to see my badge. I told him I dropped it and was trying to find it. He then asked me if I could describe their badges and I responded by bolting. I made it about 10 feet before I got tackled and a rock left a massive slice from the middle of my forum to the elbow. After which instead of getting taken to isengard I got taken to the hospital for stitches then a holding cell for the night. Fortunately they where nice enough not to press charges.                                                                  TL;dr: simply walked into mordor during filming. Got tackled by security"
"TIFU by making a poorly timed pun at work


This happened yesterday. I'm still laughing about it, people still won't talk to me.

Yesterday started off as any normal Tuesday. I strolled into work a little early, got my stuff together, and hopped on our weekly Tuesday morning meeting. I was on the schedule to give a short presentation on some of the work I've been doing, creating documentation for the standard technology we use in our business division. I'm wearing my noise cancelling headphones, watching these much more experienced engineers talk about their work with the company infrastructure.

About 45 minutes into this meeting, I notice the engineers on my row stand up and quickly moving toward the exit. I take off my headphones and hear an alarm going off. All I could make out was this voice saying ""*bzzzt burrb* This is not a drill."" My mind jumps to fire. So I run with the pack to get outside. 

We get outside, and I see people SPRINTING to their cars and driving away. I think to myself, that seems awfully uncharacteristic of a fire. I find one of the guys from my team and ask him what he heard. He said this alarm alerted the campus of a possible armed assailant on the property. 

30 minutes later, dozens of police cars have shown up, there is a media helicopter circling the building, and armed guards with their weapons drawn scanning the building floor by floor. Definitely not what I was expecting going into today.

I find some of the other workers I've talked with. I told them I was supposed to be giving a presentation today that I'm not entirely sure I was ready for. My next thought just blurted out:

""Guess I really dodged a bullet there.""

They all just stared at me. I realized it as soon as I said it. My face got super red, my palms got sweaty, and I just turned around to leave for the day. Fast forward to today and no one is talking to me. 

TL;DR possible armed assailant reported at my work, and I just fed the trauma"
"TIFU by creating a bubble-pocalypse and ruining sexy time.


My boyfriend and I decided to go on a sexy weekend. We got a hotel with a jacuzzi tub in it. So, I decided to add a few bubbles as its filling up by using body wash. I got a little excited, and added a few more bubbles than I needed. Theres a moderate amount of bubbles and everything is going great UNTIL

I turned the faucet off, and turned the jets in the tub on. It was hilarious, at first. The bubbles were growing but they were not stopping. Soon, there was a 4 foot tall wall of bubbles sitting above the tub. I turn the jets off. In an effort to get rid of the bubbles, we tried draining the tub but they're everywhere. In the tub, on us, on the walls, on the floor. 

My boyfriend tries scooping them up with a garbage can in the room and flushing them down  the toilet, but the flow of the flush made more bubbles and they just floated to the top and sat there.  Finally, we pulled ourselves together and used garbage cans to scoop the bubbles out of the tub and into the shower. It was absurd and is now one of my favorite memories. 

Tldr: bubble bath + jetted tub = hilarious bubble mountain and bubble extraction mishaps."
"TIFU by blocking porn on the work computer


Obligatory, this didn't happen today. The situation takes place about 5 years ago. Slightly NSFW. 

So, my father owns a shop. He had an employee working there when the FU happened. The employee had access to a computer to do work related stuff. One day the guy had a day off and I had my summer break, so naturally I offered to come to the shop so it could function.

I was browsing the web on the PC and I wanted to type some address into the browser. I typed ""po""... and you probably know what website the browser suggested. ""What the hell?"", I thought. Does the employee watch porn at work? I felt the urge to know, so I snooped on the browsing history a bit. And there it was. The guy watched porn at work pretty much daily. It seemed unacceptable to me, especially in a place where a client can come in while the guy's... doing his thing. I decided to stop this. I set up some DNS service to block such content. However, not only did it block the website, but it also displayed a message that the website is literally blocked by the network administrator.

The next day the employee came to work. He answered phone calls in the morning, everything seemed to be OK. However, around afternoon my father had some important message to him and tried to call him again. It seemed that the guy's phone was dead. My father then sent him an email but there was no answer. After two hours, father told me to go to the shop and check what's going on.

When I arrived at the shop, it was closed. I used my key to open it. First I thought that maybe something happened and the employee had to leave quickly. But then I realized that he took all his things that always used to stay in the shop, like his coffee mug. At that moment it struck me. I turned the computer on and checked the browser history. The man tried to access his favorite porn website again. After seeing that it's blocked, out of shame, or anger, he left the office and blocked our numbers.

The employee basically vanished and was never seen again. Even though it was nearly the end of the month and he had quite an amount of money waiting for him, he never came back to collect his salary, despite of numerous messages from my father (we didn't have his account number, he wanted cash). And what's the biggest FU here? I had to work my ass off at the shop for the the most of my holidays until we hired someone new and I taught them everything.

TL;DR: Found out employee watches porn at work, blocked it. Employee basically vanished and never came back. Had to replace him and waste my holidays."
"TIFU by telling my friend with terminal cancer who got into anime about Attack on Titan, only to realize he wasn’t going to live long enough to finish the series.


TLDR is literally the title.

This was a last year but my friend’s death anniversary just passed and it made me think about how much I miss working with him and chatting about Pokémon Go. He even gave me his Pokémon Go Gotcha before he passed and said “I can’t use it when I die, so keep it for me.”

I worked with him for 5 years and he ended up being one of the coolest and quirkiest guys I know. He was our database developer and an old school cool nerd all around good guy. About a year before he died he started showing up to work less and less often. And when I suggested we should go see a movie he said it was kind of difficult for him to sit through long films. Well come to find out he had developed a stomach tumor that had entangled itself into his intestines, so removing it was impossible even with chemo treatment. 

As a programmer he had a very straightforward no bullshit logical approach to everything, so after researching everything and calculating his probability of survival he just accepted that he wasn’t going to live another year. He just did his best to make the most of his remaining time and for a bit started getting into anime because he needed something to get his mind off of things. We started talking and he asked me if I knew of any good anime, and I told him without thinking that I thought Attack on Titans was great. 

Well he came back the next day after binging it and gave me a ton of shit for recommending him a great anime but fucking up because he won’t be able to finish it before he dies.

I miss the hell out of you Clair, fuck cancer."
"TIFU by not using deodorant for 6 months


For the largest part of my life, I have been using spray deodorants. It's the first thing I ever used, and I have never had a reason to switch to a stick type. 

Right before last Christmas, I was beginning to run out of deodorant. The one I use is rather expensive, at least by my standards, so I put it on my wishlist for Christmas. Christmas comes around, and I was happy to pack up a new deodorant. There was, however, a catch. This one was a stick type of deodorant, as the ones who bought the present couldn't find the spray version. I had never tried a stick type before, but I didn't care enough to replace it. 

I quickly learned that it didn't smell as much. The smell was much thinner. I just shrugged it off, because it seemed obvious that a solid deodorant wouldn't smell as much as a liquified one.

Months went by. I used the deodorant every day. I no longer smelled as much as before, but nobody ever commented it, so I never gave it much thought. 
What was raising questions in my mind though, was that I didn't have to push the bottom up once. Keep in mind this was 6 months after I had been using it every. Single. Day. Either something wasn't right, or I was going to be stuck with this deodorant, that didn't smell as much as the other, for ever. So, I went on to inspect the stick.

I never had to remove any cap, so maybe there was one?  It would have to be pretty transparent, but I checked anyways. I pushed the bottom up, and... THERE WAS A LEDGE! I tried to pull the thing off, but it wouldn't move. I was afraid I would break the entire stick, so I gave up trying. It was the same colour as the rest of the stick, so it made sense if it was just a part of the mold. There wasn't a cap after all then. Except... What if I twisted it? And so I did. 
I slowly applied pressure, and slowly air bubbles started to appear under the surface of the stick, and POP! The cap was off. I was shocked! I realized I had not been using a deodorant, but a plastic cap... FOR 6 MONTHS!

It is amazing nobody has noticed any smell...

Tl:Dr: TIFU by not removing the transparent cap on my stick deodorant, and therefore using the cap as a deodorant for 6 months."
"TIFU by assuming the office was empty.


This happened yesterday. I am lactose and fructose intolerant which basically means that my body can't handle these types of food very well, so generally I try to avoid such foods, but you gotta give yourself a treat once in a while, don't you?

So the night leading to yesterday I had large appetite and decided to grant me a giant bowl of oatmeal with milk and slices of banana and in the morning I still felt great. That changed drastically on the way to work though as I realized I was bloating up like a balloon. Being a nice guy, I don't fart in public with other passengers near so by the time I arrive at work, I feel like a cramping zeppelin... But fate was on my side as my whole team, except me, was scheduled for a meeting and oh my did I anticipate the alone time to get at least some relief...

On a side note: For those of you who think ""why doesn't he go to the bathroom and farts there or take a dump?"" It doesn't work like that for me. Building up massive amounts of gas doesn't mean I need to take a crap and if I need to fart, that urge is most likely gone by the time I reach the bathroom and even if I made it in time, one fart is just the tip of the iceberg.

So finally everyone left the office and I decided to let a little one go, just to estimate the impact of the forbidden food and what seemed not so bad the first 4 seconds hit me like unimaginable horror... Toxic mustard gas refinery seemed like an appropriate label for my bum.

I decided to get as many out in a short amount of time, having enough time to open the windows and get rid of the evidence of my seemingly rotting insides before my colleagues came back.

As I was sitting there in shame, contaminating the air around me, I hear steps of high heels approaching... Ok, it's my female boss but she shouldn't have any business visiting me in my office so I should be safe... Wait, these aren't just steps of one woman, it must be 2. Then it hit me: today our new female colleague is going to be introduced to our team...

As I hear them chatting and getting closer, I desperately try to wave the smell away and pressed my butt on the chair to keep the last bomb from releasing it's full nuclear power, praying they will notice the office is empty and don't even get to my room. Of course I was wrong.

They entered the office of my team and approached me while smiling... I start to sweat, my heart is pounding, I'm screwed and as I have to stand up to shake her hand, the invisible horror spreads and their smile disappears in a split second. My boss even holds her nose and asks: what on earth is that smell?!

By that time my life is obviously over. I made some comment like it must have been something from outside, but I hadn't opened the windows yet. They saw through my lie right away, she introduced herself quickly and they both literally fled, leaving me behind full of shame, guilt and embarrassment. I rarely wanted to go back in time so desperately...

TLDR: Assumed the office was empty, released the most foul farts humanity has ever faced, only to have my female boss introducing my new female colleague to me while the stench was at its peak."
