"Tifu: by getting caught woth a butt plug by my mom


This actually just happened to me less than an hour ago. So I am in highschool and am currently exploring things such as sexuality and sex and other stuff. I consider myself rather... kinky... I had just gotten some Amazon money for my birthday and had decided to buy some ""toys"". This included some sexy panties, a dildo, and, of course, a bitter plug. My butt plug arrived in the mail Monday and I was stoked. I was nervous that my mom would open it before I got home or ask what I got in the mail. Luckily she didn't and just handed it over to me. I tried it that night in the shower an it felt great. Today after I got home from school, I decided to use it. Later in the evening I was cleaning it in my room in preparation (I hide it under my pillow in my loft bed so no one would find it). My mom knocked on my door to come in. I let her in because I was sitting facing with my back directly to the door so I just put it in my lap and though she wouldn't see it. She was asking me what I wanted for dinner and then came over to my desk to see what art piece or craft project I was working on ( I'm also a very crafty person and my desk is always cluttered with art supplies and other stuff). She complimented my latest polymer clay craft. For a second I forgot my butt plug was still in my hand so when I waved to her I accidentally flashed it. My mom gave me an embarrassed look before leaving the room before peaking her head back in and saying "" I didn't see anything."" She retracted before peeking in once more and told me to ""hide them better"". I was (and currently still am) MORTIFIED! I don't know if I should laugh or if I should cry. I don't think I can look at her in the eye for the rest of the night. I'm just glad my mom isn't angry or anything. 

Tl;dr : My mom found out about the butt plug I got off amazon. Now I can't even look at her out of shame for the rest of the night."
"TIFU By leaving a pot brownie out and getting my little sister stoned before school.


First post here, long time lurker, mobile, blah blah blah. Let’s get to the story

This happened a couple weeks ago when my work did a secret Santa thing. My secret Santa gave me a 100MG pot brownie cut up in four pieces. I was excited to eat it, so when I got home I popped one, laid down on the couch, and played some Minecraft. I fell asleep sometime, slept through my alarm for school, and woke up at around 10. I sat up, and saw my pot brownie out. Two of the pieces were gone.

I started to panic, the only person in the house from last night to now was my 11 year old sister and my dad. I snuck downstairs to my dads room to see him still asleep, so I know it wasn’t him. I picked my little sister up from school that day before my mom could, and I told my mom I was taking her out to eat or something like that. I asked her if she ate the brownie. She said yeah, and I told her what it was, and asked her how it felt. She said it just made her tired. I told her to never fucking take anything of mine again, and moved on. I also told her to never tell anyone.

TLDR; Left out a pot brownie, 11 year old sister ate some of it,  she went to school stoned."
"TIFU by never mentioning an allergy to my girlfriend


My girlfriend and I had been out late partying last night, and woke up pretty late in the day. We were pretty darn hungry and it was around lunch time, so we figured it was a perfect opportunity to head over to Golden Corral and pig out. After we finished stuffing our faces, we did as one does at a buffet, and smuggled out something snacky. So I filled up a bowl of those orange-slice gummy candies, brought it back to the table, wrapped some napkins around the pile, and stuffed it in a pocket for later.

As I'm driving us home I start slowly munching my way through them. I get through about 6 or 7 of them and I start to feel a bit off. I smack my lips a bit and say ""man, why does my mouth feel so dry?"". My girlfriend looks at me funny.

""you good?""

""yeah... I dont know, I feel really...off?""

I glance over and she is now looking very concerned. I suddenly realize my mistake.

""Ohhhhh. Fuck.""

""Fuck??? what do you mean? what?""

""I'm allergic to these! I forgot.""

""YOU WHAT""

Now to me this wasn't *that* big of a deal. I'm allergic to some ingredient in certain gummy candies. I've never found out exactly what. Jelly beans and gummy worms are ok, mike and ikes and any of those fruit slice ones are not. Its not that bad of a reaction. My tongue swells a little, my mouth and throat get super dry making me incredibly thirsty, and I get a bit light headed. I would probably have to eat a lot to end up in the hospital. This isn't even the first time I've forgotten and eaten a type I'm allergic too. 

The problem is that somehow, in the 2 years we have been together, its just never come up.

My girlfriend starts freaking out, thinking I'm going to need to go to the ER, worrying that I'm about to pass out while driving us, and I'm trying to explain that 'its not that bad'.

It doesn't help that I'm also giggling a bit over the silliness of forgetting I'm allergic to something. I finally get her to calm down a bit. Chugging massive amounts of water when we got home probably did not help her concern but it wasn't until about an hour later that she stopped staring me down, expecting me to die any second. 

But hey at least now she knows. Any time I go for any gummy candy now, she swoops in and makes sure its a type I know is safe. She also tells the story any time allergies come up in conversation.

&amp;#x200B;

tldr; somehow in the 2 years we were together i never mention my allergy. i forget it, eat something i'm allergic to. when i mention thats what I just did, my girlfriend panics because she doesn't know its not that serious of an allergy."
"TIFU by not listening properly to myself


An annoying FU that comes from too little sleep. I pulled into the supermarket on the way home from work today, pleased that I'd finally made the effort to get what I needed for a recipe for my new crock pot. I even gave myself an extra pat on the back for remembering my shopping bags!

As I was about to get out of the car I made the decision to leave my work bag behind, tucked out of sight. I hadn't brought my wallet with me to work, so there was nothing inside I needed... One less thing to cart around.

I practically skip into the shop, then stop short as I realise that I'd put my shopping list in my wallet (so I wouldn't forget it!). No problemo, says positive me. I'm sure I can remember what I need.

Well, by the time I get to the checkout, I brimming with pride. I must have remembered everything, today was a good day.

There's a bit of a queue, but that's OK. I've completed today's mission. I can wait.

The family in front of me is taking a ludicrously long time, but that's fine. I'm not in a rush. Nothing is going to spoil my mood.

I carefully put everything on the conveyor belt all neat and tidy and in the perfect order for bagging at the other end.

The checkout assistant looks up, smiles and asks me if I found everything OK.

I smile back and only then realise what I'm about to say. I was about to tell them how chuffed I was that I remembered everything, even though I'd left my list in my wallet, which I hadn't brought with me...

So, that was my evening

TL;DR Chuffed that I remembered everything without my shopping list, which was in my wallet at home. Only clicked this meant that I didn't have any way to pay once at the checkout. "
"TIFU by selecting the wrong vehicle in my PayByPhone parking app


So today I brought a different vehicle to work because we got dumped on with about 15CM of snow last night. not a big deal for Prairie Canada but annoying having to brush off that layer of snow at 6:30AM - plus I usually drive a small car. So I took the SUV out of the garage because it's higher from the ground, easier to control, and the main reason - I don't have to brush it off. 

I park in a parking garage at work - monthly parkers have a transponder that goes on the dash and opens the gate. well I forgot that in my regular vehicle. So I am faced with 2 choices -Pay $4.00 an hour, daily max of $12 - or pay $4 to park on the street till lunch and then go get the transponder. I opt to park on the street. Our City has typical meters for street parking, but also a handy app - you select which zone (found on the parking meter) you're in, select which vehicle you have (can pre-program up to some number of vehicles for convenience and then just select which) - So I use the app, select the vehicle, punch in my CC details, boom. Good till lunch. 

30 mins later I realize I've selected the wrong vehicle. Selected my regular vehicle. go outside, already have a parking ticket. fuck. go down to the parking office on my lunch to see if they'll reverse it. 40 mins later - Big. Fat. Nope. Giant middle finger. So now I've wasted my entire lunch, still have to go home for my transponder before going back, wasted $6 on parking (had to pay at the parking office too) and have a $45 parking ticket to pay. 

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR - picked the wrong vehicle in my parking app - $4 parking fee turned into $45 ticket and wasted lunch.  "
"TIFU my whole day


Mondays are very hectic for me so the only joy I get to ease my misery is an awesome breakfast of raisin oatmeal.  I have it down to an art where I take a cup of water, 8 Splenda packets, some cinnamon, a handful of raisins, and about a half cup of steel cut oats and microwave it for 5 minutes.  Add a few tablespoons of butter and, voila, pure morning bliss.

Today I got all the ingredients together, using the very last of my oats, and when the microwave finished, I opened the door to a really strange smell.  When I looked beside the microwave, I noticed that instead of the cinnamon I grabbed the curry powder.

TL;DR - I had put curry powder in my oatmeal.  There was no more oats for a redo.  My Monday is sucking so badly it could suck a melon through a garden hose!! "
"TIFU by strumming to a song and ending up with a bloody asshole.


 

This happened 4 weeks ago,

I decided to get myself a proper guitar since I have more time to indulge myself lately,

I was playing it day and night, I was re-learning all the chords again and I had never been happy like this for quite a time.

I was so engrossed that I sharpened my fingernails so I could pluck the strings sweetly. My girlfriend decided to join along by singing and I would strum to the tune.

So few days later I decided to hit the bar and I got home drunk, I put some music on and went in the bathroom.

It was a really good night and the stereo was playing some awesome tunes and I was spacing out in the shower, my asshole was itchy so I decided to give it a good gentle scratch, just at that right moment I heard my girl singing along to the stereo and in my drunkenness bliss I started strumming while still scratching my asshole , it was then  I could feel this painful tear in-between my buns. Trying my best not to shout, I squirmed to the toilet roll and dried whatever blood that was dripping out. It was a terrible night.

&amp;#x200B;

 **TL;DR** : Heard my gf singing while still scratching my asshole, blood ensues."
"TIFU by leaving a stranded man in a foreign country 1200 miles away from home, by not sending a promised car-part


My uncle (a), living in another country 1200 miles away from here, had an acquaintance (b) visiting our country for some personal business.

(B), when he wanted to leave to his home country, had his car broken. He needed a specific part, and was stuck 1200 away from home.

So (a) contacted me, asking if I had the part, which I did. He asked me if I could send that right away, as soon as possible. I confirmed and promised to do that. 

I didn’t. I thought: “I’ll do it tomorrow” but the next day I forgot about it. 

A week later (a) calls me, asking where the part is. (B) was waiting for a week for a part he needed for his car but I didn’t send. 

I feel terrible right know, knowing I screwed a stranger, and probably his family as well, which probably was waiting for him to come.

My stomach hurts when I think about this.

TL:DR I should have send a car part to a man who’s car is broken, but because of me not sending the part, he was stuck in a foreign country for a week."
"TIFU by accidentally sending my boss a chat complaining about her


This just happened maybe 20 minutes ago, and I'm dying. 

&amp;#x200B;

My boss is the CEO of a small company, and I report directly to her. She's had some turnover, so after only a year I've become her number 2 and she tells me pretty much everything that's going on in the company. I personally don't like her too much as she's pretty spoiled, expects people to put in extra hours all the time, and talks so much shit behind people's backs that it just rubs me the wrong way. I've been pretty frustrated at work lately because she's been changing her mind constantly which has created a ton more work for me, including planning two holiday parties after she cancelled the first one 3 days before the event because ""we didn't deserve it."" BTW planning parties is NOT a part of my job and was just something I was delegated to do after she lost her Office Manager. She also made me change my flight home for Christmas after she had already approved my time off because she wanted me to be in the office for a phone meeting in case the client had any questions. This cost me $400 in flight change fees, for a meeting I didn't even end up speaking in. So clearly, I was pretty frustrated with her in general. 

&amp;#x200B;

Back to the fuck up-

&amp;#x200B;

She has set up our hours so we have an unpaid lunch, but still comes up to your desk while you're eating to pull you into a meeting, or ask you to do something etc. It happens all the time, and is fairly obnoxious because in our industry I've never heard of an unpaid lunch hour so it's pretty out of the ordinary.

Today, I was eating lunch at my desk and of course she comes up to ask me about a PPT she has yet to send to me, and asks me if I can come over to her desk to update the metrics on the deck. I tell her it would be faster if I just did it myself, and asked her to highlight what numbers needed updating then send to me. She was fine with that but gave me a tight deadline of getting it done by end of day. 

I go over to our gmail and send to my friend in the company:

"" i hate that i need to leave for lunch to be left alone. i want to bring my lunch and not spend the money but if im here then i can't actually eat lunch in peace.""  
I then go back to browsing reddit and continuing on not doing the PPT so I can finish my lunch hour. I see my boss has chatted me, and click back into gmail. To my horror, I did not send that to my friend, but to my boss who had JUST COME TO MY DESK. She responds with telling me shes candidly taken aback and that it was a ballsy response to send her after approaching my desk to ask about a PPT. Then asked if she should assume I was referring to something else.   
I AUDIBLY GASPED in our tiny open floor plan office. I respond with   
""hey im really sorry. i shouldn't have reacted that way, sometimes i just need to chill out.""  
She sends me a response saying apology accepted and that she want to set boundaries for the whole office, but I can feel her seething. 

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR: My boss came up to me during my unpaid lunch break asking me to work on something. I got annoyed and accidently sent her a chat complaining about her when I meant to send it to a coworker. "
"TIFU by prank calling the police and the fire department


 **THIS IS GOING TO BE A LONG ONE, SO BE PREPARED!**

Disclaimer: This happened way back in the day when I was in Germany and only 5 years old. (am 20 years old now).

Me and my brother, 2 years old at the time, were playing in the park outside the apartment we lived in.

A friend of mine, also 5 years old at the time, saw us playing and decided to join us. 

**-** He just wanted to play with us, **so, what could possibly go wrong?** (I didn’t know either)

So he runs up to us, all excited and stuff, and immediately comes to me and says this:

&amp;#x200B;

Robert: “Yo, Frank, guess what?

Me:       “Yo, what’s up?”

Robert: “I know the emergency call number for the police station, the fire department and the ambulance”

Me:       “Yes and?”

Robert: “Let’s **prank call** them.”

Me: (not thinking about the consequences about what could go wrong with doing this)  

“Holy shit, that’s a great idea, let's do that”

**At that point it was already too late, BAD CHOICES WERE MADE** 

&amp;#x200B;

So we walk up to the nearest phone booth. (don’t forget that my 2 year old little brother is also with us, not knowing what his role model of a brother is up to)

After arriving, we picked up the phone and dialed the number of the police.

My friend Robert was too much of a scaredy cat to do the talking so I was the one that had to do the actual deed. (Not like I was forced to do the talking but because i was just so fascinated by the idea of prank calling the police)

So, the phone rings, the other side picks it up.

**(I will simplify the monologue I had with them because i can't exactly remember what they said)**

&amp;#x200B;

Police: “Hello, this is the police office of Berlin, who am I talking to?”

Me:      “EVERYTHING IS BURNING WE NEED HELP, THERE ARE THIEVES AND DINOSAURS RUNNING WILD, WE NEED HELP, OH GOD THE DINOSAURS ARE EVERYWHERE, HEEEEEEEELP!!!”

Police: “Wait, WHAT? Dinosaurs? What are you talking about, who am I talking too? What is burning, what is happening?

Me:    “I DON’T KNOW, BUT EVERYTHING  IS BURNING THE DINOSAURS ARE EATING PEOPLE, PLEASE I NEED HELP, HELP MEEE!!”

Police: “Please, calm down tell me who you are and where you are, so we can help”

&amp;#x200B;

After that sentence i just hung up, because I was running out of ideas to say.

Fire department next. (same conversation, immediately after the hang up)

Somewhere in between the monologue between me and the fire department my friend noticed a small but an important detail. He saw a police car driving by us.

&amp;#x200B;

Robert: (afraid at this point) “Hey, Frank, I just saw a police car driving by us, maybe we should stop doing this and go home, they might actually come after us”

Me: (confidently) “That is just a random police car, they are just patrolling, nothing to be scared about. **DON’T WORRY NOTHING WILL HAPPEN”**

&amp;#x200B;

As I was just about to dial the number for the ambulance the police car which just drove by, stopped right beside us and out of the car two policemen stepped out.

At that point I forgot about everything I did and just made a run for it and so did my friend. After I made it home safely i locked myself inside my room and was scared for my life.

After 2 to 3 minutes the doorbell rings and my mom opens the door. After talking for a few minutes she knocks on my door meaning I have to unlock it. I decided to open the door. (**SHOULD NOT HAVE DONE THAT)** 

She stands in front of me with my little brother and a rolling pin in the hand.

&amp;#x200B;

She asks me: “Do you know who I was talking to?

Me:  “Yes, I can imagine who you were talking to”

&amp;#x200B;

That was the only conversation we had, because right after that she started beating senses into me, for what I did. As it turns out, while running away from the cops, I forgot a small little detail called my brother. The policemen were nice enough to escort my brother to our apartment. They said for what I did they could file a lawsuit against me but decided not to because I was just a little kid and didn’t know the consequences about prank calling the emergency organisations.

TL;DR:

My friend and I decided to prank call emergency organisations (police, fire department, ambulance). Which resulted in me getting my ass beat by my mom with a rolling pin and which almost got me a lawsuit filed."
"TIFU By nearly knocking myself unconscious in the park.


Whilst walking the dogs earlier today, I ducked to walk under a metal barrier designed to stop cyclists from crossing the foot bridge. However, I stood up too soon, and smacked the top of my head on the cold, horizontal metal pole. My eyes swam, and I had to stand still for a few moments.

To add insult to injury, I turned round, and despite the fact the place was almost deserted, it turned out one of my mum's friends was behind me and saw the whole thing :(

Now I am sat at home, slightly nauseous, and with a bag of ice cubes atop my *very* sore head. I may have mild concussion.

The best part? I've got an interview tomorrow :')

TL;DR
I hit my head really hard and now I feel sick.

I've not really got much more to add, but the bots will delete my post if it's not 750 characters long...."

"TIFU by drinking cheap ale on NYE


So obligatory this did not happen today, but I am still suffering the consequences.

On NYE I was feeling a little ill, but thought little of it as I planned on going out later and having a good time with some friends at the bar. Me being a little strapped for cash at the moment I decided that I would opt to drinking ale tonight (after some vodka, and some gin for pre-drinks). So off we go drinking the cheapest alcohol in the bar and as the night draws to a close and I am well and truly drunk we head off to the kebab shop for some cheesy garlic chips. Lovely! Wash it down with a couple of cans of coke and we're golden. Head home after a decent night and get into bed.

A couple of hours later I awake to an awful pain in my stomach, I am then violently sick (did manage to get to the bathroom on time though). And this continues until there is nothing left in my stomach at all and I am just throwing up bile as my stomach twists and squirms because there is nothing left in it. If I tried to eat anything (even half of a biscuit, or an indigestion tablet) It would come straight back up followed by the worst cramps and stomach pain I have ever experienced. In addition to this I was continuously rushing to the toilet to shit, except my shits were just liquid, like coffee from the ass. Its been 2 days now and I am feeling better but everything in my abdomen is still quite painful, haven't been sick in more than 12 hours though so thats good.

pray for me Reddit, I'm not going to be going out drinking again!"
"TIFU I did an oopsie in German class


Ok this is going to sound stupid and most likely, fake, but hear me out, I promise you this actually happened. Also this story is very similar to that of the person is swore in their Spanish AP exam.

A short bit of context, I studied french for 3 years prior to this event.

So it was just before Christmas break and I was in my German class, doing excersises from a textbook with my partner. Soon enough, we strayed away from the boring exercises and started making jokes about everything in the book and whatnot. We were seriously having a blast, cracking jokes that we both found unbearably funny.

Next think I know is we started getting really loud despite the rest of the class being almost dead silent and then i made one final, supersaiyan, comedic gold, r/funny worthy joke in which I screamed “SCHEISSE” which, if you didn’t know more or less means shit in German.

The whole class turned their heads to me and went silent and in the moment of it I looked at my teacher who raised her eyebrows at me. Out of all suitable responses I could have said in that situation, I then replied with “Pardon”. 

At that moment, I knew, I fucked up. 

Not only did I scream “SHIT!” In German, but then I went and apologised in FREAKING FRENCH?! Of course this followed with a humiliating thirty seconds of laughter from all my class mates, however the teacher didn’t really care and resumed whatever teachers do behind their laptops.

In conclusion kids, think before you speak, or learn to speak fluently before you speak? Ok that doesn’t make sense but thank you for reading.

TL;DR I swore in German class and apologised in french and resulted in complete humiliation. :)

"TIFU by losing my phone and forgetting my passport


So this all started last week. After 35 hours of travel, I made it from the states into Zagreb on the 26th. I was exhausted, took a nap, then headed out with my host and some of his friends for the night. Hours roll by and two of us wind up at a 24 hour restaurant for some late night grub. I had pulled my phone out to show him a song on Spotify, then stupidly left it on the table as I walked 10 feet away to the counter to buy borek for breakfast in the morning. He got up as well, and within those few seconds someone stole my phone. I didn't go to the police because my host said he didn't recommend it and that they wouldn't do anything. The next day I bought a cheap smart phone and a sim card and headed off to Vienna as that was the plan. Tried to accept my loss. After talking to more people and looking into it, I realized I could possibly file an insurance claim for up to $500 as my phone was bought less than 120 days prior. Woo! Then, the restaurant it was stolen at said they had security footage. Double woo! Then I checked my timeline on Google maps and saw that the thief had gone to a few other places early in the morning, some of which may also have security footage. Help yeah. Things were looking up. At the very least I should get $500, and potentially the identify of who stole it. So today I wake up super early to catch a morning bus back to Zagreb. I left most of my belongings where I was staying, as I was only going to do a day trip to file the report and backtrack all the places the person went to. I get to the bus station to realize I don't have my passport, and remember that Austria and Croatia do not have borderless crossing. Fuck. Email the bus company to see if I can transfer my ticket, which they likely won't, and made the trek back. Likely lost $28 which isn't huge, but not the greatest either. So all in all I lost a brand new s9 plus which had an SD card with thousands of photos from my previous travels, have lost time with all the necessary phone calls and wasted trips and getting a new phone and sim set up, and so much sleep over stressing. Some of the photos are backed up, but there was about a 5 month block of backpacking Europe when they weren't. I also have no idea what personal information is on the SD card, as I was trying to track my phone and it was shut off before I decided to cut my losses so by then I couldn't wipe it clean. I can't be mad at anyone but myself (and the thief) as I've traveled abroad for a year before and should know better. Back home, I always leave my phone for brief moments because people just don't steal off tables like that. Even at the bar I work at, phones are always turned into the bartenders. I was dumb. I still had my home mindset and not traveller mindset. This trip was supposed to be a break from all the stress back home and at this point I'm almost wishing I didn't take it. Half of the past week has been spent dealing with this, I find myself struggling to get adequate sleep, I'm out so much money, and I really just miss my fucking cat. Please post cat memes. Thanks, Redditors.

TL;DR: I'm a dumbass and had my phone stolen in a foreign country and forgot my passport causing more lost money and more delays."
