"TIFU by taking a picture of my wife's ass


This happened about a week ago.

&amp;#x200B;

I  took my wife to Barns &amp; Noble to get some new books for us to read.  I was half halfheartedly looking at different books while trailing my wife throughout the store. At some point I realize my wife is nowhere to be  seen, but whatever I'll find her eventually.

&amp;#x200B;

After  a few minutes of mindless wandering, I notice her on the other side of  the store. I also notice that her butt looks really good in the jean's shes wearing, so as I'm walking up towards her, phone camera zoomed in on her butt, I hear someone behind me shout ""HEY CREEP! WHY ARE YOU  TAKING A PICTURE OF THAT GIRLS ASS!?"" I turn around to see an employee as the source of the shouting, and look towards my wife who is clutching her sides, laughing her ass off.

I  try to explain, that the woman is my wife, but the employee was having  none of it. My wife finally came to my rescue when the manager came up  and said that I had to leave. She explained that we were indeed married  and even showed her the picture of us on our wedding day she keeps in  her purse.

&amp;#x200B;

The employee apologizes  profusely, and of course we plead with the manager not to reprimand her  for her ""outburst"" as the manager called it. Honestly I'm glad she said  something as someone from the outside seeing this guy, following a girl  around the store and then taking a picture of said girls ass. It was  just a wrong place, wrong time kinda thing, but my wife has started  telling me ""don't get caught this time"" whenever we go out. Shes told  just about everyone we know, and in lovingly referred to as ""the  ass-man"" in our friend group now.

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR  
I took a picture of my wife's ass, an employee called me out for it, not knowing it was my wife. My wife left me high and dry until the manager asked me to leave. Everyone we know, now refers to me as ""the ass-man"" now.  And before anyone starts polishing their armor, yes, my wife knows I do this. Yes, my wife is more than okay with it. She does the same thing to me.

"TIFU by naming my password recovery answer as 'dong schlong'


This happened about a week ago. It still gives me shivers.  

  

Obviously, I never thought this would happen to me of all people.  

  

I spent a lot of money on the app store and I think they blocked my card and so I had to call them up to restore my account.

A female representative picked up and said she was going to ask a few recovery questions to verify my identity. Even at this point I had no clue what was coming. Until she asked,  

""What is your most prized possession?""  

I froze. My head goes blank not because I forgot what I had written for the answer, but because I knew exactly what I had written. The answers were all the same, all the time... 'dong schlong'.

I wanted to hang up right then and there, but I knew she was looking at the answer I had written.

So, I mustered up the courage and said in a soft voice,

""uh... ^(dong schlong)""

""I'm sorry? You have to speak up sir, I can't hear you well.""

""... dong ...schlong... like big peepee (FUCK), you know schlong dong, dong schlong (FUCKING KILL ME)""

""Dong schlong. Thank you, sir.""

I was surprised she didn't crack up or anything and was very professional.

I've sinced changed all my restore passwords to something else than 'dong scholong'.

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR: I wrote my recovery password as 'dong schlong', and I had to confirm it to the customer service rep. on the phone that it was indeed, 'dong schlong'."
"TIFU by going to the gym and immediately pinning myself to the weight bench so severely that I had to be rescued. Then I did something really embarrassing.





A few years ago I spent a Saturday blissfully tripping by myself. I had dosed that afternoon and I started coming down as the sun was coming up. It was a bright, crisp morning and I felt completely at peace. I was shuffling my music and Sunday Morning by The Velvet Underground came on. It was too perfect and gorgeous to feel cliche and affected.
I suddenly made a decision. I had to make some changes. I had to get my fat ass to the gym.
I was surprised to see so many people. I had thought, hey, 7am on a Sunday, I'll have the run of the place. I was obviously incorrect. All the cardio machines were taken. I couldn't just stand there. I was already getting sweaty and I'd been so high for so long so recently.
I saw an empty bench press and went for it. I couldn't remember what I used to bench back in school so I decided to estimate on the low side at around 160. I am 6'2 and 250 lbs. I was gonna relax with some leisurely sets and wait for a treadmill to open up.
It was heavier than I imagined. I figured my guns were rusty. I decided to only execute a couple perfect pumpings of weight and then wait for cardio. Suddenly the bar reached the apex of my first attempt and my body gave up with horrifying finality. It was all I could do to keep it balanced while it came down slowly but surely like a hydraulic lift. I let it sit on my chest while I came up with a plan. Every time I tried to move it my arms shook and wobbled like a fawn learning to stand. I decided to slowly rock back and forth until it could roll down my beautiful plus size body. With momentum and gravity it would roll to my thighs and free me. Perfect. I tensed my belly and strained forward with all of my might.

*Wwwhhhooooooooooooooooot....*

The bar rolling down toothpasted a fart out. I lacked the strength to tighten my butthole so it just kinda fell out. Sounded like a giant blowing on a bottle. If anyone heard it, they ignored it. Despite my meticulous calculations, the bar had stopped and settled between my belly and groin. It hurt. I slowed my breathing and just relaxed. It'll be ok, I thought. I got this, I prayed.

*Brap brap...brap brapbrapbrapbrapbrap*.

Nope, it's bad, this is bad. Everyone had to have heard the rounds I just let fly from the ol semiauto bubblegut. The volume was incredible. No one knew I was literally pinned to the goddamn bench, ashamed and trapped there in my fart. No one laughed. Time was frozen but I assume only a few minutes passed. Finally a very small man ran over, effortlessly grabbed the weights and racked them. He looked up at me with genuine concern.

""Hey man are you alr-""

*popopopopopopop............WHHHOooooooot.*

To his credit he only grinned for a second before regaining control. More like a twitch. I nodded somberly, thanked him and shook his hand. I tried to act like my asshole had not just popped off like a string of firecrackers and finished off with the moan of a dying whale. He left me standing there, trying to plan a graceful exit strategy. Everyone was pretending not to notice me as they stared peripherally and slowed or stopped their exercise. All I wanted was a way to salvage this and look normal. Like I wasn't bothered at all.
So, knowing I was being observed, I did this. I stood tall, nodded to myself like I nailed it, clapped firmly one time and said *Alright*

**Fuck.**

**Me**

I can now find the humor in my pathetic failed benchpress and uncontrollable farting. There is nothing funny about The Clap. It pops into my head randomly every few months or so and makes my face hot and my stomach cramp.Â I just wanted to look like a normal human being.
The door barely whispered shut behind me when the laughter started. I ran to my car.

TL;DR I went to the gym under the influence, publicly displayed how weak I am, became trapped on the bench and farted uncontrollably until I was rescued. Then I pretended I had just done really well and congratulated myself with a lil nod, clap and *Alright* as if I could alter reality by sheer force of will.

"TIFU by unintentionally giving my friend a masturbation alert


[removed]"
"TIFU by showing my grandmom that she had been living a lie for almost 30 years.


This did happen today. My grandmother is really superstitious about stuff. She doesn't eat certain kinds of food on certain days of the week and other such things. One of her main superstitions revolves around the layout of the house. She says that no one should sleep with their heads pointing north. So she keeps changing the position of my bed when I am away for work. When I come back, I reposition it my way so that I don't get sunlight on my face early morning. 
Today, she was repositioning the room while I was there which annoyed me. So I took out my phone and opened the compass app to show her that I was not sleeping with my head pointing north at all. Infact I was pointing east . I instantly realised that she has been sleeping with her bed pointing north. And she has been sleeping on that bed for around 30 years. I pointed it out to her. I thought she would take it lightly. Oh man I was wrong. I fucked up biig time. She lost herself. She started pulling out the blueprint of the house and her old compass. I am looking at her old compass right now and I can say it doesn't seem right at all. I think I will have to fix this issue today itself. She is 90 and quiet hard to talk to cause her hearing isn't great. How stupid am I. 

TL;DR : I fucked up by showing my grandmother that she was sleeping with her bed pointing north which she is strictly against cause of her superstitious beliefs. She did not take it well . "
"Tifu by getting a facial


This happened about two hours ago.

I've been extremely stressed as of late and my boyfriend wanted to help me relax. He flicked my bean and went on a minge binge to my little heart's delight. He even drew me a nice bath complete with warm towels and bath beers. I really wanted to show him how I much I appreciated all his gestures, so I thought a great way to do that would be to let him give a facial. I start doing my duties and all is rainbows and puppies. He gives me the signal and I activate baby bird mode trying to give him the best view I can. That's where the fuck up occurs. I tilted my head back slightly too far and ended up with a nostril full of semen. It took a moment for me to register what the fuck just happened, but by the time I figured it out, my other nostril gets its turn. At this point, I just sit there and take it up the nose because I'll be damed if I let man gravy get on anything. I immediately go to the bathroom afterwards to evacuate my sinuses, but I didn't get it all. Not long after, I feel some slither down the back of my throat like a demented slug. I still have the smell of semen in my nose. 

Tldr: A dick in my mouth ended with semen in my nose."
"Tifu by loudly telling a female workmate I was going to finger her


So I (M 22) work in a factory that is slightly short staffed, so from time to time some of the office staff have to come through to the factory and help out. One of these office workers is a (F 18) who we'll call Jess. So Jess was in the factory helping out and I happened to walk past her wearing some rubber gloves. Now Jess and I have a friendly bit of banter from time to time, and so as I was passing her she looked at my gloves and said 
""You look like you're about to go finger a cow""
(Which is a bit of a weird thing to say, but hey ho) 
So me being the master of wit that I am instantly thought ""right, now's my time to shine! If I say the right thing I could turn this into a funny insult and call her a cow""
My brain decided malfunction and what actually came out was
""I'll finger you""
Not surprisingly this immediately drew a funny look from her and i felt my face start to glow red from awkwardness...
Because of the level of noise I  the factory I have sort of developed a loud voice in order to be heard. It just so happened that one of the machines cut out at almost the same moment and the factory went *relatively* quiet. Everybody in the immediate vicinity heard and looked over at me...
At this point I wanted to just crawl into a hole, but I stood my ground and tried explaining myself
""I meant that as though you're a cow, not that I actually want to finger you""
This seemed to clear things up for her but now everyone at work keeps making fingering puns and innuendo's. 
I can't look Jess in the eye any more. Works gonna be a little awkward for a while...

Tl/Dr:  female workmate said I looked like I was going to go ""finger a cow"" so as my attempt a a witty response I said ""I'll finger you."" Now workmates are ripping me a new one by constantly making fingering references"
"TIFU by turning my grandpa into a weeaboo.


My grandma died last year and grandpaâs tken it hard. Now he used to be the dirty old man sort of guy, so I thought getting him Nekopara Vol. 0 (A visual novel about catgirls) for Christmas would be nice.

A few days ago, we met up at a wedding. I see my grandpa. He starts excitedly chatting with me about the game and I think, âI did a good thingâ and tuned out the rambling.

I shouldnât have. We go back to my grandpaâs place.

Grandpa: Here are the new decorations I have!

Mom: Dad, what is all this?

Grandpa: Stuff from the game your magnificent son gave me!

The whole apartment was littered with Nekopara figurines, posters, merch and etc. He had a body pillow in his bedroom. Now my family looks down on me for converting my grandpa into the weebiest of weebs.

I learned today through text he picked up Eromanga Sensei. God help his soul.

TL;DR: I gave my grandad a copy of Nekopara. He went ape-shit and bought merch. My family now hates me for converting him into a degenerate."
"TIFU by lending a hot girl my fav hoodie


This sad tale literally just came to its bitter end.

So until 20 minutes ago I owned a gorgeous, bright yellow Death Grips hoodie that was my pride and joy. My mum bought it me for Christmas last year and it was my absolute favourite item of clothing.

Last night I went out with my mates and happened to meet an attractive Spanish girl who was just in Manchester for the weekend. We chatted for a bit and made out in the club smoking area as one does, then after a while she complained about the cold English weather. I predictably offered her my precious hoodie at this point. Fast forward a few hours and we exchange contact details as we planned to meet the next day to hang out, then she leaves the club. I realise she's still wearing the hoodie so run after her and ask for it back. 

This is where I make my fatal error, a fine example of thinking with your genitals instead of your head. I had the smart idea that if I let her keep the hoodie for the night, itll mean she HAS to meet me the next day and can't back out thus allowing me more time to charm her. I essentially used the jumper as fishing bait but didn't think that the fish could just eat said bait and swim away. *spoiler alert* This is what happened. 

The next day I awoke excited to spend some time with this girl and waited patiently for her to reply to my messages so we could arrange to meet. By 5 in the evening I start to get worried and message her again as well as asking her friend to reply to me. My messages get left 'seen' for about an hour before they both block me on all social media platforms shooting in the head any chance of me seeing my beautiful jumper ever again. 

To the Spanish girl who stomped on a nice gesture and on my heart, know that you have made me sad. 

Rest In Peace sweet banana coloured hoodie x

TL;DR Lent a hot girl my best jumper in an attempt to guarantee more courtship time, girl steals hoodie"
"TIFU by mishearing what my teacher said to me


This happened to me 21 years ago!  
So, halfway through grade 4, my family and I moved from Texas to Colorado. To help me get accustomed to my new classmates and not be overwhelmed on my first day, my teacher had me come in early and sit at my desk while the other students came in. While I was nervously awaiting the arrival of my new classmates my teacher walked over and gave me a warning.

  
âNow, the girl in front of you is a dork. Please donât make fun of her.â  


Hearing this, the nine-year-old me instantly came to this poor girlâs defence. The teacher had just called her a dork, and I thought this was extremely mean. So I tried to help this unmet girls aid by showing our camaraderie to the teacher:  


âThatâs okay, thereâs nothing wrong with that. In fact, I used to be one too!â After admitting this to my teacher I was suddenly overcome with a fear that teacher would think of me as a dork forever, abandoning my plan of trying to help this girl I quickly added, âBut then I grew out of it.â  


The teacher gave me the most puzzled look I have ever seen and seemed like she was about to say more but decided against it and left.   
All the kids came in and sat down at their desk and I looked up at the girl in front of me and realized I had misheard what my teacher said. The girl wasnât a dork; she was a dwarf. I had just told the teacher I used to be a dwarf, but I had grown out of it.

  
tl;dr Misheard the teacher and then told her I used to be a dwarf but grew out of it.

"TIFU by eating oreos and making my mom think she was going crazy.


This happened around 2010 when I was roughly 24 years old. I still lived at home with my Mom who always had a sweet tooth. Now, by this time she was suffering from some early onset dementia and did not work, so she had a lot of time on her hands. She liked to call customer service numbers and give them a hard time about little things for some human interaction, in my opinion. She had been calling Nabisco several times about her opening brand new Oreo packages and finding the center row of the tray  almost completely devoid of Oreos. I knew this because she had mentioned it and would leave notes from her phone calls around. I rolled my eyes as I was used to her being a little nutty. According to her, it kept happening and she began taking photos of the Oreos each time it happened to try to prove to Nabisco that she wasn't making this up. I assumed she was eating them and forgetting.  One day, I'm in the kitchen and I open up a brand new package of Oreos and grab several from the center row.  As I start walking away, it hit finally hit me! She didn't realize that Oreo had updated their packaging to having the Easy Open Pull Tab on the top! She was still opening the side of the package and sliding the tray out. I was the Oreo thief the whole time and didn't know it! We had a good laugh over it. My Mom died shortly thereafter in January 2012 and my sister bought me an Oreo Christmas ornament. I smile as I recall the Oreo Incident when I decorate my tree each year. 

TL;DR - I was using the new Easy Open Pull Tab on the top of Oreo packages while my mom was still opening the package from the side and sliding the tray out which led to her thinking Nabisco was shorting us Oreos."
"TIFU by slapping a girl so hard she is now deaf in one ear


 

A year or so a go I met a pretty but very shy girl on tinder, we dated, got along and then struck up a casual sexual relationship. We both had stressful jobs with long hours and just used each other to have aggressive ""stress"" sex as she called it. One day she messaged me at 1 AM, she told she was very turned on and wanted me to come over. Now I am a man, if a pretty girl asks me for sex I am going to pathetically come running. So up I got, had a quick shower and cycled through a wet and cold London night to her apartment (I wasn't going to pay the Â£35 or so for an Uber). Once I arrived she just wanted to fuck, she apparently had a massive argument with her ex and a long horrible day at work. So we proceeded to have sex, she usually liked it rough and liked a gentle face slap, but that night she asked me to do it harder, then harder and then even harder. Her face was red and she was very evidently liking it but I was nervous, I enjoy rough sex but I was hitting her rather hard and I didn't want to bruise her face nor do any damage.

Then she grabbed my head and pulled me down and bit my lip hard and said ""fucking hit me"", so I did as she asked...

After sex we were cuddling and she said her ears were ringing but she had a great time and she was in a good mood so we showered and went to bed. In the morning she woke me up by shaking me rather hard, the pillow where her head had rested throughout the night had a brown coloured, bloody discharge stain on it and she said she couldn't hear out of her ear.

I was mortified, offered to take her to hospital or that I would spend the day with her to make sure she was alright etc. I was scared there might be worse problems than the suspected burst ear drum and deep down I was scared she might hold it against me.

She went to a doctor and said she had ""fallen over"" when they asked how it happened, we stopped talking a while after that and she got a boyfriend. Fast forward one year and I messaged her to ask how her ear was. She still can't hear out of it and apparently it can't be fixed :( . She was lovely about it all and said it wasn't my fault and that I shouldn't feel guilty which did make me feel a little better.

&amp;#x200B;

**Great sex though.**  


TL;DR I slapped a girl so hard, her ear drum burst and is now deaf in one ear permanently "
"TIFU by trimming my junk


So, this actually happened last night. Yesterday was my wifeâs birthday and as a surprise I decided to trim the jungle that resided below for some sexy time fun. Now, I'm one of those men who has a slight pot belly and over the years it has gotten bigger causing this task to be increasingly difficult. No big deal. Despite limited visibility I can generally feel my way through the deforestation, or so I thought. I get about 90% of the way through my task and all thatâs left is the front of my berries. Here is where I fuck up. Usually I look down and stretch/flatten my saddlebags so I provide a flat surface for the electric trimmer to glide against. In my haste I was not looking very closely and assumed the lawn was flat. Unfortunately, it was not. The electric trimmer grabbed hold of a fold of skin and thrashed it like a dog playing with a toy. I felt a burning pain and immediately withdrew. Now, I have nicked myself before so I imagined it was just a slight cut. As I looked down I realized this was not a tiny cut. Blood was dripping off my love sac at an alarming rate. As I dab the blood and reveal the damage I am in shock. I had about 1/8 inch wound I could probably fit a pencil eraser in. I walked over to my wife and told her something happened. As I revealed my mangled manhood she let out a gasp. No sexy time tonight. We bandaged my wounded soldier as best as we could and went to sleep. Today it looks better. I think it will heal on its own without the need of an embarrassing doctor visit. Guys, make sure the lawn is flat before driving the mower over it.

 TL;DR I wasn't paying close attention when trimming my junk with an electric trimmer and sliced my sac open."
"TIFU by not remembering to breathe


*Throwaway account, because I have no intention of memorializing this fuck up in my actual Reddit history.*

This happened over the past weekend. 

So, there I am, masturbating in the shower. I was sharing a guest house with five other occupants. It wasn't a vacation. It was work accommodation. We were crew on an intense television series that was being filmed in various small town locations. Lots of long days and late nights. The usual shit. 

It's 20:30pm. **Fuck up time.**

It was the end of a long ass week. I had to purge. So, I smoked some weed with the crew/roomies, and then took a shower. I wasted no time getting down to nut busting business once I went nude. I didn't realize just how damn long it's been since I choked the chicken, until that first stroke. I damn near moaned. 

I up the speed. My hand is practically becoming a blur. I'm so deep in the moment, or you know, just too damn high to realize, that I'm actually holding my breath the entire time. My head's beginning to feel like it's spinning. I don't stop. I'm approaching the point of no return. It's close. I can feel it. Just another stroke or two to unlock the jizz gates. At that moment, I pass the fuck out. 

I wake up within moments on the bathroom floor, bleeding. At the same time, the door swings open as two stoned colleagues of mine barge in to see if the crashing sound they heard wasn't all in their heads. For the record, it wasn't. When I collapsed, I fell, back first, through the fucking glass walls of the shower. 

Thus, there I was, naked in front of the two dudes I work/live with, covered in minor cuts and a load of cum. 

What will no doubt scar us all forever was my damn dick remained rock hard and throbbing when I gained consciousness. Which is how those motherfuckers found me on the floor. 

Fuck you, life. **Fuck. You.**

*Fuckyoufuckyoufuckyoufuckyoufuckyoufuckyou.*

TL;DR I smoked weed, stroked the D, and forgot to breathe."
"TIFU by laughing in a guysâ face when he asked for my number


This didnât happen today. It was actually a couple of years ago.

I used to work as an attractions attendant at a Universal in Orlando. I canât tell you how many douchey guys would make stupid remarks and fake hit on me while I worked there, but it was enough to make me think that every guy that hit on me was just joking and being stupid.

Anyway, I was checking seatbelts and harnesses when I get to this one guysâ row. As I was checking his seat he says âHey, I was looking at you from behind the gates over there and youâre my type, can I get your phone number?â And I just laughed in his face because I thought he was joking. I mean, I threw my head back and laughed and then I just gave him a sarcastic âno, sorryâ and continued checking seats.

Well as I was checking the row behind him and his friends, I hear him say in a really sad voice âguys she said noâ and I have never felt so bad in my entire life. 

This poor guy actually wanted my phone number and I laughed in his face, which makes me look like the biggest bitch on the planet. If I had known he was being serious, I would have politely declined and told him that I have a boyfriend.

If you are the guy I laughed at, IâM SO SORRY

TL;DR: laughed in a guyâs face after he asked for my phone number because I thought he was joking. He was not joking."
"TIFU by failing spectacularly at pranking my husband


This didn't happen today.  I shared this in another sub and was told I should share with you guys too. 

I went through a phase of popping out of hiding and startling my husband. We both find it hilarious. One day, I came home and realized he was in his office with the door open. I decided to take the opportunity to sneak in and scare him. I dropped to the ground in the hallway and slowly and silently army crawled into the room towards his chair. It was hard not to giggle. He was completely oblivious to my presence. I was going to grab his ankle with my bony little hand like the Crypt Keeper and scare the shit out of him. I get within distance and slowly reach my hand out to grab his ankle. Then I realize he's masturbating. I just totally froze and felt a mixture of horror and and panic. I decide to slowly back up and reverse crawl out of the room. Before I can move, he looks down. He looks down and sees his wife on the ground at his feet, not moving, with her hand outstretched to grab his ankle. We just fucking stared at each other. 

 

TL;DR   TIFU by failing at pranking and catching hubby wanking"
"TIFU by jokingly insulting my 7-year-old kid in front of their teacher


Obligatory didn't happen today, but last week.

People who know me say I'm a gentle soul, but that I have an ""angry listening face"", don't do small talk and can be quite opinionated, so I tend to avoid other people at my children's school, because interactions usually don't go well...

So last week Thursday, I arrived at school to pick up my kids and went to the store right next-door to buy some groceries. School is in English and we speak French at home, which means we can usually say whatever we want without anyone eavesdropping. While waiting in line, I turned to my daughter and went ""You're ugly"", to which she replied ""thank you"".

Now, you need to know the back story... There is this French black comedy called ""Tatie Danielle"" which features an angry, old lady insulting and abusing everyone. In one of the scenes she tells a mother ""Your girl is nice, but damn, she's so ugly"". This sort of became a running joke in our family and I feel this also teaches my kids not to take insults at face value. We sometimes throw out quotes from the movie, mimicking an old lady voice.

Of course, I did not know that the only teacher in the school who understands French was behind me... and this of course is my daughter's teacher. She was shocked and let out a small gasp.

I turned around and she told my angry listening face ""Your daughter is not ugly"". She then started talking to my daughter: Is your father tough at home with you? Is he mean to you? What about your mother, is she tough with you?

Without missing a beat, my daughter went: Nope, they are both very cool.

To this day, this teacher still looks at me suspiciously.

TL;DR: I jokingly told my daughter she was ugly. She said thank you. All this while her teacher was standing behind me, who now thinks I abuse my kids."
"TIFU by misunderstang a miserable girls simple request.


TL;DR I didn't under stand what a girl was asking me so I ended up telling her most intimate secrets to a room full of guys  


Ok so this was actually some time ago back in 2005 but I figured it belongs here.  


I was in highscool and devil may cry 3 had just come out. I didnt have a console to play on but was an avid fan of the series so i asked my very popluar friend Fidde if I could come hang out in his student pad and play it on his ps2 to wich he agreed. awesome! So we get there, I'm happily mashing buttons when some of his also very popular friends show up and they decide to head to the supermarket for some snacks and drinks. So I am left all alone in the small apartment, happily playing videogames when suddenly the doorbell rings.  


""thats odd"" I thought to myself. they have the key. maybe they're carrying stuff? the bell rings again so I go over to the dor and open it up and find a girl standing there with her eyes all red and bawled out, the faint smell of beer on her breath.  


""Is fidde in?"" she asked timidly.  
""Uh no sorry, but he'll be right back, he's at the store"" I told her  
""Uhm ok"" she paused then asked if it would be ok for her to come inside and wait. I didn't see a problem with that so I let her in and went back to the game.

only a minute or so passed before she tried talking to me. she sheepishly explained that she was unhappy about some stuff and that she'd really like if she had someone to talk to. I wanted to be a gentleman but I also wanted to play the game so I end up lending her an ear going ""mhm"", and ""ah , yeah"" every now and then but lord have mercy on me because she decided to not only tell her lifes story but also reveal som rather private and embarrasing things she'd done.

Turns out she was having relationship problems, she was in love with a guy that her friend then started dating so to get back at her in some way she started going out with her friends ex but since she was unhappy about it she had sought comfort from her old friendzoned guyfriend who she ended up hooking up with but he then confessed that the ex that she was currently dating was still in love with her friend and a friend of her crush had told him that her crush was actually into her and not her friend who he was currently dating. and then she told me that she had been unhappy because of that and been drinking alot and ended up hooking up with some more guys that she regretted now. there were probably more details but that was the gist of it.

Now I have this ability to retain short term information well if I am playing a mindless game while listening so while she was talking everything she said was imprinted in my memory to the very last detail and halfway in I realised the every single one of those guys that she mentioned were at the store with Fidde. 

She went to the fridge and brought out a beer bottle and asked me if I thought Fidde would be okay with her having it. Confident that he wouldnt mind I said ""sure, why not""

Halfway into her bottle the party came back all suprised to see this girl with me. There was a certain akwardness in the room and I understood why but I didn't really care. Chad and stacy problems weren't my problems.

After everybody said hi and settled down just haning out she leaned over to me from her chair and said ""Uhm, could you tell'em please?""

I pause the game, confused, could she really mean what she was saying?  
""Are you sure?"" I asked with a serious look on my face. surely all that stuff would just be way to embarassing for anyone to know, but then again she did tell me, maybe she just needed help coming clean? yeah that made sense.

""OK then"" I said and cleard my throat and turned to the room.

""Uh yeah excuse me everyone, Louise here asked me to tell you all that...""

I proceeded to recite her story, being careful to include important details and give an as fair and informative version as possible of her ramblings.

A couple of sentences in, her face turned bright red and her head fell into her hands as she covered her face.

When I was done monolouging for 5 minutes straight there was an intensely akward silence as everybody stared in disbelief

""Did I get everything?"" I asked her

""Noo!"" she whined through her hands, ""about the beer I took from the fridge!""  


We all died that day, guts busted beyond repair from laughing so hard. One kid fell to the floor and couldn't get up for an hour. On the bright side, having all that cleared up solved her problems so although embarrasing, it all worked out in the end."
