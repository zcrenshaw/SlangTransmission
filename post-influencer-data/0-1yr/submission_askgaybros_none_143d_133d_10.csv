"Guys who are HIV+ should always disclose their status before meeting


This is a counterstory to the guy who posted on here yesterday about falling in love with a HIV+ guy who only disclosed his status when they met in person.

My counterstory:

When I was 22, I met this guy from Tinder. We hung out for a while and then got back to my place to have sex. I had already asked him on Tinder whether he was clean from STDs, he said yes, so we had sex. Protected sex. We were together for 7 months. I hadn‚Äôt gotten tested since I met him and we were having protected sex all the time. One day, I went to the dentist and when I finished, I decided to go to the healthcare center to take an STDs test since it was in the same building.

A few days later, the doctor called telling me that I tested positive for HIV. It was lunch break at work and I started crying in front of all my coworkers. I went back home and yelled at the lying piece of shit I dated and he cried saying that he didn‚Äôt want to let me know about his real HIV status so that ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt leave him‚Äù. I was outraged. I could‚Äôve sued him for what he did where I live, but it wasn‚Äôt worth it. Now I‚Äôm only 24 with HIV, which has made finding dates extremely difficult, but does that justify lying to the people I see? Hell no! Does it (at least) justify not disclosing my HIV status until we meet? NO!

That guy‚Äôs story and his HIV+ bf could lead guys with HIV to avoid disclosing their status until they meet their dates in person or even worse, lie about their status. You must understand that anyone who‚Äôs HIV+ should never hide or lie about his status with anyone they plan to date/hook up with."
"You‚Äôre the problem, not Grindr. ‚ö†Ô∏è Trigger warning ‚ö†Ô∏è


So 70% of the posts in this community are complaining about being rejected, ignored and dismissed on Grindr, not being attractive enough and angry at everybody who is ‚Äúprivileged‚Äù that is out there fucking and enjoying their fruitful dating app experience. 

First of all, Just because you typed ‚Äúhey handsome‚Äù to TopMascDaddy69, doesn‚Äôt mean he is obligated to reciprocate the same interest. nobody owes you shit. It is nobody‚Äôs fault how you look like and everybody is free to reject, ignore or not even respond to you if they don‚Äôt want to.

Second, most of you contact guys because of their appearance and then cry when they reject you on yours. that automatically makes you the same shallow type of person you claim they are. If you believe that your appearance is hindering you from meeting guys and don‚Äôt like how you look, then do something about it ( gym, surgery, whatever...) instead of projecting your own shallowness and lack of self esteem on the entire gay community. 

You try to push a negative impression and villainize ""chads"" or people who take pride in their appearance as if they are some how evil just because they aren‚Äôt attracted to you. you come on reddit all entitled posting fucking novels about how ""attractive"" people are cruel, racist, homophobic, anti-fem, etc... trying to link those irrelevant reasons to why they rejected you knowing that is not the case. 

There is no argument about how dating apps are mostly used for sexual encounters and appearance dictates your success. However, most of you don‚Äôt go for guys who are in your category that share similar characteristics, aesthetics and attributes. You reject certain races and limit yourself to that delusional fantasy you created in your little head about what kind of man you decided is attractive.


Grindr, tinder and all other dating apps are not the problem, you are. That low self esteem, false sense of entitlement and high level of delusion are all signs of being a gay incel or ""gaycel"". You are not ready to be dating anybody until you get your shit together. And also, that victim, self pity, woe is me bullshit is no longer effective üòâ"
"PSA: Please If You Are Underaged Do NOT Get On Grindr!


I am not sure why this has to be repeatedly said. The fact that some 15 year old boy finally revealed his age to me after we had talked for a while and kept trying to promise we wouldn't get caught and got pissed off I had been ""lecturing"" him. He went on Grindr for a Boyfriend and sex and had told me he already had found someone. I reported the account so quick.

Dudes, who are underaged please do not get on those apps. You are opening yourself up to predators and you also are risking other peoples lives. The ""I like older men"" excuse isn't enough to make people unknowingly commit felonies. It's sick and fucked up. Please stop."
"I went on a date with a guy who told me he was HIV positive...


...and he thought I‚Äôd break off dating him.

He thought wrong. I made him my boyfriend this past weekend and he‚Äôs a wonderful human being."
"Anyone else find it fun casually revealing that you're gay?


When I casually mention my boyfriend to people I've been speaking with for a little while, jaws will almost invariably drop and/or I'll get bemused looks. Not because they're homophobic (at least I doubt they are), but they're just shocked that I'm gay. 

I don't even find it offensive as it's just their natural involuntary reaction, and it's nice knowing  that they now know that gay men can be like any other bro."
"I don't want to be treated as a woman just because I'm gay


I came out a few months ago and everything went great. Every response I got was positive. 

Next to the yearly family reunion, we have a men's day and a women's and it's basically just a day where you hang out with your cousins and other family while doing something fun. Both days take place on the same day and the women usually do the more girly activities whilst the men do the more manly activities. I never skipped one of those days, because they were so much fun. 

Each gender has its own group chat in which all the important information is posted. Each year has a different group chat, because the organising party differs each year. That's where the problem started. I wasn't added in the men's group, but the women's group. I was a bit confused and decided to contact my cousin who was organising that day. She told me that I would have a better time with them, because I'm basically a woman. This pissed me off. Why does being gay make me a woman? I'm not the most masculine guy, but I'm not that feminine. 

I called my other cousin (brother of the female cousin), who was organising the men's day, if I could be added to the men's group and he told me that I would have a better time with the women, because I'm gay and 'into other stuff'. I got mad at him and said that I'm not a woman, so I would be going with the guys. He then proceeded to tell me that they already reserved something and it was too late to add another person, so that I wouldn't be able to come anyway. 

I was really mad and confused. We've known each other for all our lives, but coming out, I'm a different person? Why does being gay not make me a man anymore? I'm Dutch and homosexuality is so integrated in the entire culture that I never thought that this would be a problem.

I talked to a few other family members and they said that I should just come to the women's day and tag along with the men again next year. 

Should I just go to that women's day or should I skip that day this year?

Did any of you experience something like this as well?"
"LMAO my straight friend just send a vid of him jerking off to the group chat


This is so funny. He‚Äôs a straight little Christian boy and I never would have suspected he even sent nudes, and suddenly this vid appears of him jerking off in the gc, moaning and everything. 

P.S. Not a bad dick, probably about 6 inches."
"Lost my virginity yesterday to my first boyfriend


It was amazing. I was nervous at first but he helped calm me down. When he first put his dick in my hole, it cramped up and I was like ""No, Not doing this"". But after a little bit we tried again.... He went really slow and made sure I was okay the entire time. Being fucked feels AMAZING, 10/10 Would bottom again"
"Some real advice on HIV from an actual HIV+ gaybro


Like many times on this sub reddit, the topic of HIV can hang around for a few days with everyone wanting to give their opinion. Some posts treat HIV+ people like the bogeyman, other posts act like HIV+ people are life's way of scaring ""regular"" gays ""straight.""

For all the advice, good, bad and wrong in the last few days, here's my advice on dealing with HIV from someone who's been positive and (now) happy for over a decade.

Think long and hard who you will tell. You don't owe the world, or anyone, an explanation, and you can't untell. You don't need to be an advocate to have value 

Don't be afraid to change a doctor. There's some nice ones and not nice ones out in the world, don't suffer for no reason

Don't neglect your ""other"" health; from weight to smoking to that ingrowing toenail you never dealt with. You're entire health doesn't need to revolve around HIV

Connect with other positive people in the community and listen to them. There's an enormous gulf between what a doctor tells you and the actual lived experiences of human beings

Re-infection isn't real. Not when you're on treatment, anyway. Don't be afraid of sex. If it's nerve wracking at first, go slow or find other HIV positive people to re-learn the ropes with. But you are entitled to an amazing sex life and there's no reason you can't have it

Treatment is more than a pill, it's acupuncture, mental health therapy, exercise, massage, self-care, etc etc. Don't neglect it

You deserve happiness, so cutting out negative people, jobs, family members, or removing yourself from bad situations is always going to be the answer, trust yourself

Sometimes love isn't worth it, and sometimes they aren't worth your love

If you're being the best version of yourself, or working towards it, you're doing things right

If you can, keep a little reserve of pills around. An extra months supply is a nice buffer to have (oh pharmacist I'm going away, next month, can you give me early?)

Imagine how you want your life to look in 1 or 5 or 10 years time, then work backwards from there

You are strong. Stronger than 99% of other people you will meet. Be strong and be fierce in your own way

You'll have sex. And better sex, than you EVER did when you were negative

And the best thing? You'll never have the anxiety of taking another HIV test again!

Happy living, my fellow HIV+ gaybros!"
"Relaxing your standards with guys isn't about compromising: it's about realizing that something outside of your predefined box might make you really happy.


For a long time I thought people talking about changing your standards implied compromise, that you'd feel like you had something OK but that wasn't actually fully satisfying for you. I now realize this is the wrong way of looking at it. If you allow yourself to appreciate people who might be different than what you think you want, you might find someone that makes you realize there's no compromise at all. 


This is a realization I came to recently after meeting someone that makes me happier than I've ever been. I initially had a lot of hesitations and  reasons why I thought it wouldn't have work. After sticking it out, I'm so so freaking glad I did. A real deep love can surprise you when it actually happens."
"Small dick dudes own that S**t


Recently I had a post where a guy had told me his dick was 8 inches and when I saw the dick...well it was barely pushing 6 and he kept trying to say ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs 8 for real I measured,‚Äù and I‚Äôm not sure where he got that number but I‚Äôve had over 30 dicks in my face alright? I know 8 from 6

Now I‚Äôm talking to another dude who saying his dick is 8 inches but it doesn‚Äôt even got past his finger.

I get why these dudes do it but If I‚Äôm saying, ‚ÄúHey it‚Äôs ok you‚Äôre dick doesn‚Äôt have to be huge for me to suck it,l and they still want to give these outrageous measurements, it‚Äôs a huge turnoff. 

Like if you got a small dick, own it, some guys care more about confidence in their men than the tools they have."
"I finally officially came out to both my mum and dad at dinner tonight


After we ate I asked if we could talk about something and I finally did it. 5 years of stressing and worrying about reactions and at age 17 nearly 18 I am now ‚Äúout‚Äù with my family

Yayyy :D"

"What even are these Vain ""Woke"" Gays?


These are the type to post statuses for LGBT rights, ending racism and are proudly feminist yet they are the same ones to laugh at ugly people or make jokes about poor people. I talked to these ""woke"" twink types (yes, I did say twink types because it's really only the younger gays that do this) who constantly share anti-prejudice statuses online yet when this overweight guy walked past, they both wrinkled their noses and said eww. Sadly this wasn't the only incident, I see ""prominent"" figures in the community who are all anti-discrimination on Facebook, yet I over hear them in clubs talk about how disgusting some of the guys dancing near them are and they also shun out the less ""trendy"" gays who don't look cool. I have since forgotten about these things because they happened last year, but recently I watched a youtube video featuring a group of them and it was just full of jokes about how ugly the guys who message them on Grindr are and them demeaning each other and random people in public for looking poor and ""trashy"". 

&amp;#x200B;

I don't know if it's the fake-ness they portray online or just the hypocritical anti-prejudice stance (except if you're poor, ugly and uncool) that annoys me more? So let's get this straight if you're woke but also vain, does this mean you're ok with asian (or any other POC) guys talking to you in clubs as long as they are hot? Are all women are amazing? What about the ones that look trashy and poor? 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm not even anti-woke, I'm just sick of this hypocritical bullshit."
"I'm really glad I started doing GayBro meetups


I study plants and animals, and really wanted to start a group of guys to go hiking with. I live in Los Angeles, so a ton already exist. I wanted this to be just slightly geared more toward talking about plants and conservation. Plus, i didn't just want to meet guys on Grindr or at my school's Pride Center. I wanted to meet guys that could get dirty and not mind, or go on adventures, or carry a decent conversation in person.

So i just organized it. I have run a QueerSTEM club before with somewhat disastrous results (politics, plus I'm not good at running a club), but i am good at organizing and getting things going. And I'm so happy i did. I've met new friends, brought my usual friends and even reconnected with my ex. I met a guy on one of the hikes and its just been going so well. 

I get to share knowledge about the environment and hang out with fellow gay and bi guys. Its the type of group I always wanted but didn't know how to make it happen.

If you're ever considering going to a meetup and you feel safe, do it. Just say yes. Make time, and go network. Bubbles are hard to live in."
"All these HIV posts


Just assume that any guy you're sleeping with is HIV+, regardless of what you think and what they tell you.

&amp;#x200B;

Take all precautions which are common knowledge by now.

Thanks for coming to my TED talk."
