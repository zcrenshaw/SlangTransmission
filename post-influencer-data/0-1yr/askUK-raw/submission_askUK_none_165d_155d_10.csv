"What should I do about my parents ?


 

I come from a working class family who have been incredibly good to me over the years.

However, as time goes on my parents are getting much more bitter and hateful and I'm struggling with how to cope with seeing them this way, they used to be so happy in their younger days.

My Dad (60) spends most of his time after work ranting about politicians and immigrants and most of his TV is question time or the news which he sits and gets angry at.

My Mum (61) is to me the most lovely person I've ever met, yet away from me she has this insidious side in which she puts down others over trivial things and seems to wish ill fortune on most people for one reason or another along with constantly ranting about people on benefits, to the point that in the last week I've not heard her talk about anything else. I'd say 95% of her conversations are around people on benefits.

I hate to say it but it feels like the parents I loved so much as I grew up have died and been replaced by hateful, cynical versions of themselves. Yet to me they are both lovely, so I feel like I can't cut my ties to them, yet staying around is like watching the happiness and joy drain from the two people I love the most as they turn into miserable wretched people.

What should I do ?"
"I’ve been boxed in by my neighbour, should I call the police?


I feel ridiculous even contemplating this but, basically, I’ve parked on the road where my house is and there was a car parked in front of me. One of the neighbours is really weird about his favourite spot and I’ve seen him actually park his car in the back of people’s bumpers before when they’ve parked there. To clarify, it’s not residential parking it’s just a standard suburban side street and I’m not blocking a drive way or anything. I just went round to ask him to move it because I need to go to work and I’m boxed in, I saw him in the living room of his house and when I rang the doorbell he’s actually hidden from me. Is that a police matter? I can’t get him to come out and move it and I can’t get to work if he doesn’t move it"
"Which MP do you reckon has the quickest pint?


All 650 current MPs (including John Bercow) are handed a pint of lager in the house of commons, which one sees it off quickest?"
"Do you remember the ""7 up"" lifetime documentary series? ""56 up"" was in 2012, and they film the same group of people every 7 years. ""63 up"" should be this year, so when does ""63 up"" get released?


Do you know anything about when the film ""63 Up"" is supposed to be released? I watched all of the other ""Up"" films, from ""7 Up"" all the way to ""56 Up,"" and would like to keep watching until every one of them dies.

So do you have any information on ""63 Up?"""
"How do you feel about Americans that believe they’re Scottish, Irish, Welsh etc?


Inspired by a recent meltdown of epic proportions from an American firmly being told that despite what they considered their ‘cultural heritage’ to be, claiming to be Scottish because they have some ancestry from there, and having ‘Tartan Pride Parades’ doesn’t make them Scottish and is a bit naff. 

We all know the sort, don’t we? The ‘Irish-Scots-Welsh-Part-Cherokee-Americans that will pinch you for not wearing green on   ‘Patty’s Day’ because their great-great grand uncle was from Dublin, which totally makes them a Loyalist Irishman (ssh... yes, I know, that’s deliberate, because I’ve actually heard that one). 

But do you have any sympathy with it at all?

Is it just naff and to be expected from loudarse Americans? Or do you not really care? 

Personally, I think it’s annoying and naff, but generally harmless, *unless* it also comes from the kind of person that also tells you you’d be speaking German if it wasn’t for Americans, and that they’re the greatest country in the world because of all their freedom, and you’re basically a slave because you’re not allowed assault weapons. 

But anyway, over to you, what do you think about over-hyphenated-Americans? Threat or menace?"
