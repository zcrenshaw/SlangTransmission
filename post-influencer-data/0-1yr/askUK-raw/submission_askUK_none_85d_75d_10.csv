"Am I a dickhead for doing this to a big issue seller?


So there's a bloke who hangs out in front of the local M&amp;S selling big issues. First time I saw him I asked how he was doing and offered to get him something from inside.  

All he wanted was a drink so in I went, did some shopping and got him some of their lemonade. He was very thankful.  

Next time I go he recognises me and we chat for about 2 mins and then he mentions he's thirsty. So I offer again. Repeat.  

A couple of trips are like this until one day he greets me with ""I'll have a sandwich and a drink"". I laugh and jokingly and mention something about being a waiter or something.  

This has devolved into him just barking what he wants at me and I've just resorted to saying hello. He was literally shouting into the M&amp;S what he wanted as I didn't acknowledge his 'order'.  

I confronted him on this saying I don't offer anymore as you're taking the piss. A few people saw and looked a bit disgusted at me."
"How do the British generally feel about producing so many great figures?


Britain has produced so many great figures. It’s hard to list a country who has as many great figures as Britain does.

- Charles Darwin 
- Isaac Newton 
-  michael faraday
- Captain James Cook
- Queen Victoria 
- Jane Austen 
- James Clerk Maxwell
- shakespeare
- alexander graham bell
-Isambard Kingdom Brunel
- Alan Turing
- Stephen Hawking
- Charles Dickens 
- Sir Timothy John Berners-Lee (inventor of the World Wide Web)
- Alexander Fleming 
- J. R. R. Tolkien
- George Orwell 

The industrial revolution happened in Britain. Arguably, it is among one of the important event in human history. Britain also had the largest empire in human history (although I am against imperialism I can still respect that). 

Do the British generally notice how great things Britain has produced? They seem generally humble about it. But do you sometimes feel proud?"
"Update: Am I the Asshole?


Original Thread here: https://old.reddit.com/r/AskUK/comments/bug66i/am_i_the_asshole/

So anyway there was an update today. The car hadn't moved since my last visit. The MOT expired so I reported that to the police and nothing happened. Then today I looked out the window and saw a lady from the council sticking a notice on the window giving warning that the car will be considered abandoned if not removed within 24 hours!

This quite excited me. I ran another car tax check and the owner has SORN'd the car. So it shouldn't really be on a public highway anyway so I let the police know. On top of that one of the tyres was completely shredded and the bumper is now hanging off. Not sure what happened there

I got home today and the car was gone! Happy days.

Oh wait...what's that parked in the neighbours front garden....oh the car. Sigh.

At least the visitor parking space has been freed up."
"People who immigrated to the UK, what's different here compared to your home country?


I've lived here my whole life pretty much and since I'm currently visiting Spain, I've noticed supermarkets have less stuff compared to supermarkets at home. Also it's sunny everyday, I'm not used to this!"
"Why does British food have such a bad reputation the world over?


The biggest complaint is that they’re bland, tasteless, and dull."
"What should I do with £10k as a student? Is it odd to not want to spend it?


I come from a low income background and got the max student loan (£8.5k) and after 2 years of uni have saved £10k. Next year I will have a job so it feel odd to have 10k saved, but I don't need anything right now.

1st year I saved £3k, worked all summer and earned £4k and saved £3k again this year. I live in a shared house and am not working atm. Due to my course I have little free time so don't eat out or go out much and spend £20 a week on food. I grew up on a low income and still eat small simple cheap meals. 

I have put it all in a help to buy ISA (2.5%) and savings account (3%) but feel like I should be using it?"
