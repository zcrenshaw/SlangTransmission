"Who else is looking forward to Gladstone Brookes going bust?


Their stupid PPI adverts have been annoying me for years. Counting down to the 29th of August. Although I will miss shouting ‘GLADSTONE BROOKES’ at the end of each and every advert."
"Is it normal to have a bit of a panic about life at 25? I've absolutely no idea what I'm doing.

"anyone else feel social anxiety is on the rise big time in the UK?


maybe its just me"
"Is trying to find somewhere to rent always this painful?


Here's my experience so far

*Having to make viewings ASAP or you don't stand a chance (I've now set up a Python script to automatically email me within five mins of them being advertised).  

*Viewings getting cancelled constantly, some at short notice and some not even informing us.

*Getting shown round properties with multiple other couples, and the agent informing us that an offer has already been put in a few days before (why not just give it to them?).  

*Arrogant lettings agents who act like they're Leonardo DiCaprio in Wolf of Wall Street (why? Is being a letting agent even a good job?)

Is buying a house a worse or better experience?"
"Any advice on how to deal with a builder who is resorting to arson attacks?


I employed a builder at the start of the year to do some renovation work, by the end the work was half completed and the work that had been completed was piss poor (verified by two independent surveyors). As such I held back the final payment which was half of the total amount. He promptly employed a debt collection agency and a lawyer, I got one as well to defend my case and there's been a lot of going back and forth. It's quote obvious he doesn't want to go to court as he keeps suggesting compromises but I'm standing fast on wanting to defend this. Since and during these negotiations the following has happened: -

* Two vehicles on my driveaway set on fire, one utterly destroyed to the point it was melted to the drive and the other half destroyed. Insurance paid out the value and police closed the case as not enough evidence.

* Garage door set on fire, just paint damage but that's more due to the arsonist incompetence

* Brick chucked through window and the intent to chuck a basic petrol bomb through, I confronted the arsonist but after a brief scuffle he managed to run away. 

* Cement paint chucked all over the front of the house

The police are being beyond useless. We know it is 100% linked to the builder but the police refuse to even question him. It has also taken them 2 weeks to collect the CCTV footage from me from the second arson, it's been a week since the third attempted arson attack and they haven't sent anyone else yet. It took them 3 days to collect the petrol bomb (a petrol can that had some sort of lighter fuse attached to the nozzle).

These attacks are going to continue and the police aren't taking it seriously at all, what is my best course of action? My elderly parents have already had to flee the country because of this."
"How can I have the most Milton Keynes holiday possible when I visit at the end of October?


Recently, my cheapness and interest in things that people hate coincided when I noticed that I could buy a return ticket from Budapest to Luton for literally 15 GBP and then noticed how close Luton is to Milton Keynes. So, I booked a ticket and plan to spend October 29 to November 1 in MK.

I'm not particularly interested in having an ""authentic"" experience while visiting. Unless someone can convince me otherwise, I would particularly like to avoid any distinctive local ""culture"" and any locally-owned independent businesses. I'm hoping for an entirely soul-free holiday.

As of right now, my plans are to rent a car at the airport (preferably a Ford Mondeo diesel), check into a chain hotel, and spend most of my time watching TV, working remotely, driving to ethnic fusion chain restaurants, buying crap at the mall/Tesco/ASDA/Currys/etc., and enjoying a few pints at Wetherspoon's in the evenings.

Does this sound like a good (or terrible, depending on perspective) plan? Does anyone have more suggestions on how a tourist can really lean into the soul-less stereotype of MK and experience it fully?"
"Why does milk in England come in a plastic bottle instead of a paper carton?


From what I've seen, an average UK household goes through around 1.5l of milk per day. Given how much we use, why not opt for something more biodegradable? We do it with juice, why not milk?"
