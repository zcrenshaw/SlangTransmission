"Is it normal for tradesmen to lie?


Is it normal for builders/plumbers/fitters etc. to lie blatantly about problems with their work?  In the past month I've been astonished by the following creativity from various tradesmen:

* I had a new kitchen sink tap installed and found that it wasn't on straight.  On complaining to the plumber, I was told, ""That tap can't be put on straight,"" followed by a long and obviously-nonsense line of reasoning why.  Another plumber straightened the tap in less than 15 minutes.
* I had new curtain rails installed.  Most were fine, but one was very obviously not level - it was out by at least 2 cm over a 2 metre length, and its two sections weren't even in line with each other.  In the space of less than a minute the builder said, ""It _is_ level,"" then ""I've leveled it now,"" then ""That curtain rail can't be put up level.""
* I had a Venetian blind installed which was supposed to be wooden but turned out to be plastic with a wood grain pattern on it.  I asked, ""that's not actually wood is it?"" and was told, ""Yes it is, it's faux-wood.""  In the conversation that followed, I was told, ""You can't get them in real wood,"" then ""Real wood ones cost three times as much.""  A quick Google found real wooden blinds custom made at similar prices in the first couple of results.  

Do I just have to resign myself to putting up with this sort of thing whenever I deal with tradesmen?

"I'm an NHS worker and I'm going to get fired for no reason at all


I work for the NHS. I've worked there for almost a decade now. In the last year or so I have received a decent promotion and earned it with years of study. I enjoy my work and have been constantly engaged with it and from my point of view I'm a decent employee.

It seems in the last 6 months or so, every day I go into work I am having my quality of work brought into question by a clique of old women coworkers that are quite hostile to me for some reason. I cannot think why they dislike me but that is beside the point, what matters is they do and they collectively work against my effort to improve by fabricating events, reporting incredibly minor things and trying to pin any mistake on me.

The group has been reporting all types of problems to my boss and I've had multiple meetings with him at this point. I've told my side of the story and have evidence that supports my case in many examples. However, there are hundreds of little things that have been reported so refuting them all is impossible. My boss has taken the womens' side and has given me four weeks to go through a ""capability test"" to see if I can go four weeks without being reported. Word has got out to the other workers about this capability test and I have told him that it is virtually impossible for me to go one day without a problem being reported nevermind four weeks.

I have found out that this capability test is formal NHS procedure prior to redeploying an employee to another job or simply firing them. So it is really a formality that he is going through, otherwise I think I'd already be fired.

I am a very chill guy, however the fuckery that is unfolding in front of my eyes make me wonder about how evil people can be to each other.

I feel that if someone else were in my situation they would have lost it by now with the level of insult that has been thrown my way.

I know the saying goes ""there is three truths, your truth, their truth and the actual truth"". I feel that in my case I am telling the actual truth but yet the other sides' fiction is winning."

"Is this legal in the UK?


My girlfriend often gets morning shifts after working evening shifts. This means that she finishes at 23 and has to be back at work at 7 AM the next morning. This leaves her with maybe five hours of sleep if she falls asleep the second she hits the bed.

I remember hearing something along the lines of you can't give somebody shifts that are too close to each other. Any ideas?"
