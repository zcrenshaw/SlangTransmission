"Is this normal behavior in the UK?


Hello,

I've been working in the UK for 3 years, and at first everyone seemed nice in my first job. Very friendly and helpful. However, at my workplace everyone is constantly complaining about each other, as in all day pretty much. Especially the women, but men too. I've overhead them multiple times talking about me too in a negative way. Things out of my control, deeply personal things, the way I do things. I try and be the best I can at work so it is very frustrating. It is very weird, because they are very nice in person and nice to each other... just when in the room. 

Often, they try and complain about other coworkers to me too like I'm some kind of counselor, and I find myself getting drawn into it. I cannot stand things like this; I try to stay out of it. I don't think I'm being sensitive, I just find it stupid. Why do people feel the need to be talking all the time anyway, when what they say is garbage? I don't mention anyone's name at work to avoid this.

How, as a young man do I maturely deal with this? Is it normal and natural? Is it a cultural thing, or a problem with my workplace? Because I have seen this in multiple environments and it makes me ask the question."
"Neighbours are keying cars that park outside their house, what can we do?


So we live on a narrow residential street with no bays or resident parking, just on street. My grandparents come over fairly often and often the only space is outside my neighbor's house opposite. They park entirely on the road (not the pavement) away from any dropped kerbs or driveways etc, entirely legal parking, yet they have been keyed twice now for parking there. (We thought the first one was just a freak vandalism but no)

What can we do? Obviously they are parking on the next road over now but this behaviour is unacceptable and I don't think they should be accommodating disgusting behaviour like this. If we got a CCTV camera and caught them doing it, would the police care? (And make them pay for all damages sustained?)"
