"Dear 'the reddits', what are these weird rubber doilies which can be found in urinals with twee names like 'p-wave'? I'm at a loss, and that's not like me...


I find these everywhere at the moment. (I'm from Brum) and I'm at a loss to work out why they are there, other that to collect fag ends which have been illegal in British pubs since '96."
"Documents for NINO interview


I am an EU citizen and I have moved to the UK a couple of weeks ago.

My NINO interview is a few days away, but I have never received my letter. I have been trying to call them but the line is always busy. What documents should I bring to the interview? All they said on the first phone call was that the letter would have all the information I needed.

Do I need to bring my job contract and my tennancy agreement, besides my ID card? Is an online bank statement accepted as proof of address or do I need the original document?

Thank you in advance!"

And what on earth is it supposed to look like? I've lived here for 2 years now and still cannot work it out."
"ALDI and LIDL store assistants is the job worth it?


Now obviously high wages are worth it but I’ve heard they make you work super hard but is it so hard that the wages aren’t worth it and you’d rather work somewhere else?"
