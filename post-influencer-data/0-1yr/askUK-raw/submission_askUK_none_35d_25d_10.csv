"People who played tour guide for out of country friends/relatives, what mundane thing did they lose their mind over?


Had friends from Hong Kong visit a while ago and they went nuts when they saw a red phone box that they spent several minutes photographing it."
"If the Queen can't by convention intervene in a constitutional crisis to protect Britain's people and institutions... then what is the point of the monarchy?


It can't be tourism. Empty French palaces draw more tourists than inhabited British ones, on account of the fact that tourists can actually go inside them."
"What is the most overrated tourist attraction in your area? And what is the most underrated?


In NE England:

Overrated: Alnwick Castle. An overpriced Harry Potter film set.

Underrated: Saltburn by the Sea. Weird, quirky and wonderful for it. Scenery isn’t half bad either."
"Do you pick Blackberries?


There are probably tens of kilos worth on bushes within 5 minutes walk of my office and nobody seems to want them.

Surprising really, as they're free, fresh, plentiful and tasty. Could knock up some jam, make a crumble or tart, freeze them, or dehydrate them."
"Why is there less of a sue one another and lawsuits culture in the UK compare to how rampant it is in America?


I mean Americans sue each other for every little thing. “You’d be hearing from my lawyer” 

A toilet roll accidentaly falling on someones head in a supermarket in America is enough reason for them to try and sue that chain for the little incident (slight exaggeration) but it seems they sue for everything, no matter how ridiculous. 

But in the UK i dont even think i hear of anyone sueing anyone. Is it a case of “just cant be bothered” in true British fashion or is it generally more difficult to?"
"Why are there so many useless apprenticeships?


I just finished sixth form and I 100% know I will never go to uni, I was looking at apprenticeships and more than half are for chain restaurants. Why would a chain restaurant offer an apprenticeship which needs a minimum of 2 a levels to work as a chef I would understand if the requirements where lower but whats the point in going through all of that education to get a minimum wage job?"
"Company storing scans of customers faces with identifying information. Legal?


 I work for a very well-known opticians chain, popular in the UK and Ireland.

Recently they have implemented a policy that every customer getting a sight test must do a full facial scanner. They say that this is to help match the best shape glasses for the customers shape face. The results of these scans are almost the exact same for every customer, but we are made to do it for everybody to the extent that the managers are saying not to even ask permission anymore that the company are giving prizes for the store that has the highest percentage of faces scanned.

We don’t even open most of the scans to show the customers, the company just wants the scans saved. We are even made to do it when we know the customer isnt buying glasses.

So, I have a question, is this legal? on the file is the customer’s name, dob and national insurance num and now a full scan of their face. I just get a bad feeling about it. 

Maybe I'm watching too much black mirror, but does this seem dodgy to anybody else?"
