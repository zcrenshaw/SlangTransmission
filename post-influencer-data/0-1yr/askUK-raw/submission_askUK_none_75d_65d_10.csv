"Does anyone else feel guilty using the wrong supermarket’s bags in a different shop?


I used a Sainsbury’s bag in Morrisons this morning and there was a definite side eye"
"Please don’t judge me as a bad parent, I already feel terrible, can anyone answer this, my daughters got a school trip on Sunday to Belgium, just realised an hour ago her passport has expired... called passport office, quickest they can renew is 1 week, any way round it?


My missus is in floods of tears, it’s our fault, we are wankers, total oversight, does anyone know a way round the system? Years ago you could go to Petty France and do it in a day but you can only renew an adult passport in a day now.  She’s 13 if that helps. I really hope someone can find a loop hole in the law to sort this or I literally think she’ll never forgive us. Please help!"
"Do young people have it harder? (At buying houses, getting jobs etc)


So I've (23) had a 'heated discussion' with my dad (59) about the state of my generation, why we rent rather than buy, how much we socialise and about the perception of my people my age unwilling to be ambitious or advance themselves.

My dad is of the opinion that things were at least as hard when he was my age, that my generation are lazy and obsessed with socialising rather than saving to buy a house and more widely are entitled and used to have things given to them. The fact that people are paid not much is a reflection on people not wanting to get better jobs and comfort in their position. He thinks that people going to university and not working after school was their choice and arguably fault for not getting money early to save. 

I argued that a lot of my generation do work very hard, do save for houses but generally are rent locked in expensive areas, that new houses being built are far too expensive for first time buyers despite efforts to help this. I was under the impression that there aren't many jobs or many jobs which young people are likely to get that pay well enough to be able to afford houses. 

Do you think that things are more difficult for people trying to get on the housing market than they were 40 years ago?

Do you think previous generations had it harder or easier than the current 20 year old?

Are the younger generations more lazy than previously, or is this an out of date view that doesn't correlate with reality?"
"When buying bakery products from the supermarket, is it acceptable to put your hand inside the plastic bag like a mitten, then grab your pastry and turn the bag inside out?


I do this all the time but I'm not sure if it's considered to be OK"
"Has anyone turned their front or back garden into a meadow rather than lawn?


Looking to help out the ecosystem and whilst it's probably too late for this year, I'm sure summer 2020 will come round quickly. Has anyone done this? How much work was it and how much maintenance is required?"
"Is it considered misleading / false advertising if a Scratch Card is promising a huge jackpot win when those top prizes have already been won?


Take, for example, the [£250,000 green scratch card](https://www.national-lottery.co.uk/c/i/page/scratchcards/popup/250kgreen.jpg)

On the front it says you could win one of 8 top prizes of £250,000, and it's certainly an incentive to buy the card and have a go. However, if you check the [National Lottery Scratchcard Prizes page](https://www.national-lottery.co.uk/games/gamestore/scratchcards) it shows that all 8 of these prizes have been won. Therefore, the top prize that can be potentially won now is actually just £5,000.

£250,000 red, Gold Fever, [Monopoly](https://www.national-lottery.co.uk/c/i/page/scratchcards/popup/monopoly-plain.jpg~0584), Pay Day and Triple Lucky 7's also no longer have their top prizes either."
