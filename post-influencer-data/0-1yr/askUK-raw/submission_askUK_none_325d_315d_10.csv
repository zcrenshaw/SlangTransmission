"Best value for money 100% peanut butter


Hello. I've recently taken to eating peanut butter on toast for breakfast before work as it's quite dense in calories (which are much needed before a cycle in to work) and easy to make when you are half awake.  For environmental and health reasons I decided to switch to 100% peanut butter with no added palm oil.   


I've noticed that the jars are usually smaller and more expensive. While the additional cost is perfectly understandable, I was wondering if anyone can recommend a particular brand which is a good compromise between size and price?  


Thank you!"
"Anybody know where I can buy slippers where the padding doesn't erodes away so quickly?


It's alright with Primark poor slippers but with some luxury slipper boots for winter costing Â£30+ and the padding is still erodes to nothing gets annoying. 

They must exist somewhere, surely?"

The song White room includes the lyric ""I'll wait in the queue when the trains come back"""
"Supermarket butchers' meat


Is the meat that they sell at the butcher's counter in supermarkets any better than packaged one you can get off the shelf? I got some chicken breast fillet from Sainsbury's butcher for the first time and it did seem nicer than the stuff I normally get (moister and more flavour) but it might just be placebo."
