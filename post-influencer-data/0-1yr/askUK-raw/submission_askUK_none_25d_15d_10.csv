"Is curry actually popular in the UK?


Had an argument with someone from England who says nobody actually eats curry in the UK it’s just a meme, but often seen it in tv show so I’m wondering what or how curry is in the UK."
"UK trains: if there are seats available, are you obliged to sit down? GWR


Had a strange experience this morning. I like to stand up on the train, even if there are seats. Mainly as I sit down for most of the day at work, and my legs can ache a bit from sitting so long. 

Today the conductor asked me to sit down, because otherwise the carriage appears full to those standing on the platform when we come in. I politely refused and mentioned that I prefer to stand - the train was half empty anyway. 

She became very insistent - to the point of rudeness - but I still politely declined, and at that moment her colleague came through. I asked him to confirm and he told me I could stand or sit, up to me. 

So, are there rules about this? Who is right? Should I be aware of anything? I don’t want to be a pain, but I also don’t enjoy being patronised. Thanks!"
"I’m moving to the UK and have a lot of(probably stupid) questions such as “What the hell is a current account?” and “am I allowed to have a pet snake?”


I’ll be arriving in about two weeks. I’ve got everything serious(housing etc) sorted, but need some advice on the little things. I’m a British Citizen but I was born in the US and have lived here my whole life.

1. What exactly is a “current account”? I just need an account to store all my so I can use it to pay bills and stuff is that the right thing?

2. Is there no ID card other than a driving license? What do people who can’t drive so when asked for ID?

3. On the topic of driving; I can drive on my US license for a year, but after that I’ll have to go through the standard process to get a driving license. Are the requirements super stringent? I’m slightly nervous about it because I didn’t even have to take a driving test to get a license here. 

4. Is it legal to keep pet snakes(and if I do will people think I’m weird?)

5. Will people be ok with me if I mention I’m new in the city? In a lot of places here people don’t like out-of-towners and saying you just moved t will usually be met with “fuck off, we’re full.”  Is that common in London?

6. Is there a specific sub for foreigners in the UK?"
"Anyone else just get small town depression?


I moved from Manchester to a small town in Lancashire and been here for 2 years, almost 3 years now, and I've just felt so down and the atmosphere is just so grey and gloomy. Nothing to do here and never seen so many idiots before.  It's cheaper and the people are down to earth but my mental health detoriates from just living here. Anyone else have this?"
"Do other Brits also find it hard to not be polite to their virtual assistant?


I find it impossible to not say please when asking google assistant to do something, I also struggle to avoid reactivating afterward to say thank you.

I was wondering how many well mannered Brits have the same problem? Plus do you think it will help when shit inevitably goes skynet on us?"
"How's your mental health?


I'm a single 20s something male and not understanding why I've had two meltdowns so far. I go to the gym regularly, eat well, recently got a permanent job for the first time in ages (zero hour contracts are awful). Have mates as well, but don't really see them that much, since we got our own lives with work and other commitments. Also trying to figure out what I want to do for a living, as the job I just got is just for consistent income until (hopefully) figure out what I want to do for a career. I'm on okay terms with my parents and older brother, we don't hate or love each other. I spend a lot of my time watching videos on YouTube, Netflix or BBC iPlayer and would be embarrassed to admit that's what I do in my spare time, other than gym. I used to love video games, but I don't know why that interest has disappeared. Maybe an attempt to be more productive. Ultimately, I think I might just be a 'snowflake' and lacking discipline and 'hard work', if I'm struggling to function.

So how is your mental health?"
"What is your favourite condiment?


Here in the US, most grocery stores have a few tiny shelves dedicated to British food. I never bothered with any of them until coming home from a trip to Dublin where I had something called brown sauce and I was looking for something similar, leading me to HP sauce. So far I have tried Branston Pickle, the aforementioned brown HP sauce, and Colman's. I have to admit that I am clueless as to why British food is so often stereotyped as being poor quality, because these 3 items are amazing. What else am I missing out on?"
"anyone else here in a bit of a rut?


I want to preempt this thread by saying I am not asking for sympathy here.So please be nice.

On the face of it, I know I don't have things so bad - fulltime job, live alone, generally healthy. But I am in a big rut, eating and drinking too much, just getting by day to day. Doing just enough at work. Every night I drink alcohol and wake up the next feeling rough and fed up. By the time I get home after work, I crave a drink and just spend the evening faffing around watching TV, browsing the web and not doing much. My weight is creeping up and it feels hard to make positive changes. 

Are (or were) you any of you in a similar state of mind/way of living. And/or did you manage to get out of it? I feel stagnant/trapped/static/crap/meh."
