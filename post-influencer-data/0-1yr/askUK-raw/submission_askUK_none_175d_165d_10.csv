"Do you see constant lateness as disrespectful?


My thing is timeliness. I cannot bear to be late, if I am late for something I start to shake and have sweats I hate it. I also cannot stand other people being late. Now once or twice that's fine, but the same people all the time? That is surely a sign that they aint that bothered about the time your going to spend with them right? If traffics bad, leave earlier. If you overslept, set an alarm. I put this here because I've been told that lateness isnt a big issue but I just cannot  separate it from being disrespectful. "
"‘State schools prepare children to be obedient workers, private schools prepare children to be leaders’ - to what extent do you agree/disagree?


My mum is doing a degree later in life and she came across this idea in one of her books and messaged me to tell me because she found it so interesting. 

And I can see it. I was a kid in the 90s and then a teacher (for my sins) until a few years ago. And nothing had changed, it was still ‘be quiet, tuck your shirt in, everybody has to look the same, copy this off the board, don’t ask why, just do it, why?, because you’ll have to do what you’re told in the workplace.’

Then you get to the workplace and actually those who progress have leadership qualities like creativity, initiative, and nuanced interpersonal skills like influencing and negotiation. They don’t necessarily do what they’re told, it’s more of a debate and isn’t about obeying at all. And as somebody who had been a very ‘good’ student at a state school, I found that mould hard to break out of. I had to learn from scratch how to ‘break the rules’ appropriately and what the new rules were. 

But that’s just me. What about you, what do you think?"
"People who work in CeX, CashConverters &amp; similar - what are your most memorable stories when it comes to people trying to sell you things?


I was recently in a CeX &amp; the rather shifty looking person in front of me suddenly decided he **didn't** want to sell the Xbox he brought in, once they asked for ID. 

Just wondered how often this happens? Do you come up against suspicious customers a lot? Or have you ever had a really memorable experience with a customer - be it for a positive or negative reason?"
"Do you correct Americanisms your children pick up?


Those with children, do you consciously correct your children when they use Americanisms picked up from cartoons etc. Or do you leave them unchecked?"
"When you call a suicide hotline (samaritans, etc), what do you actually talk about?
