"Would anyone like to go to Prague for free with friends?


I bought seven tickets to Prague with Wizz Air but won't be needing them anymore. Figured it's kind of a shame for all of that to go to waste so I thought I'd ask you lot.

&amp;#x200B;

Here are the basic flight details:

**6th July: 19:55 - 22:45 Outbound LUTON to Prague**

**9th July: 22:40 - 23:45 Inbound Prague to LUTON**

&amp;#x200B;

I have checked and you can change the name on the tickets free of charge.

Feel free to get in contact here if you're interested, it's an awesome city. Or my discord is rocklain#5916 if you wanna get to know me. We could play some games or something."
"What's your ""never again"" brand or place from UK?


Inspired by the ask reddit question earlier cos I didn't recognise half the replies."
"'Period poverty' is the main cause for girls absence from school. How can I help with this? Is there a charity or organisation reacting faster than the authorities?


As a male in my thirties I can't setup a 'sanitary station' outside of a school talking to teenage girls but surely there is something I can do?"
"What are some UK centric lifehacks that the majority of the UK population don't know?


Like ways of saving money, getting a cheap asf holiday, how to not get ripped off on something and little things that make life a lot easier. I've asked on the United Kingdom subreddit and got loads of great answers but I thought it probably won't hurt asking here aswell. I learned lots of cool shit from you folks I need more. Thanks Ladies and Gentlemen."
"Any plumbers here? Need advice to help a disabled person.


Hi. I work as a handyman in the UK. I'm pretty competent and quite good with my hands, but never got the chance in life to get a formal qualification. As a result I mainly do low/mid level handyman work. I will sometimes work with a sparky and plumber and gain some experience so I don't consider myself a complete novice.

Anyway i was called out to a job to do some repairs on a wardrobe. The lady who called me out was disabled due to a stroke. I got talking to her and she tells me she has been without hot water for the past 3 weeks and she has been taking cold showers. Her heating works, but no domestic hot water.

This is what happened. 3 weeks ago she called out a plumber to replace her taps on a basin. After replacing the taps water stopped flowing from all the hot water taps including the thermostatic shower in the whole property. The plumber claimed it was an airlock and tried to sort it out, but failed. He left and never returned.

Her domestic hot water is supplied by an immersion heater. It still works as it also supply her heating which is working fine. At the top of the heater the hot water supply pipe is part way hot as well, but further on it is just like warm. It seems the water isn't flowing. Nothing came out of the taps and shower when I turned them on.

I did suggest that she calls another plumber. I even offered to be there when the plumber comes. I thought money might be the issue and offered to pay her bill. She refused. She is very reluctant to let anyone come into her home. I have no idea why she trusted me, but I do have that effect on people. I'm very worried about her as she is disabled and very vulnerable. Any way you guys can help? Any idea why there is no hot water flowing through her taps?"
"Are the majority of UK occupants semi dependant on alcohol?


I was just listening to the radio and was really shocked to hear that first, on average people have 51 hangovers a year and secondly, how hard the commentators found it to go without alcohol.

Do the majority of British people really find it that hard to go without alcohol? I know dry January is a thing, but a few years ago I got diagnosed with a chronic illness and had to stop drinking. I did this without even thinking about it. I can't be that special surely.

Secondly if the average number of hangovers is one a week and you take into account the elderly and people like me, are a lot of people really getting hungover two or three times a week?

I don't know anyone in that situation, am I weird or just hanging out with weirdos?"
