"Does Rachel Riley (on Countdown) do all the numbers games live without help from producers?


I've been watching a lot of Countdown lately, and I'm always so impressed with Rachel Riley. How on earth does she get the final numbers right every single time? 

I know she graduated from Oxford so she's definitely not mathematically challenged like me, but in order to do that day in day out on television without fail... Does she get the answers through her earpiece, just in case?

God I need an aspirin."
"What happens after a successful job interview?


Hello, quick question about job interview.

I have a final job interview soon and I wonder what happens if I pass it? Do they offer a contract to sign on the same day or how exactly does it work? It's one of the largest banks in the UK.

I also have another job interview soon (stage 3 of 4) so I wonder if I could wait with accepting the contract offer from job no.1 until I know how stage 3 of the other interview would go. "
"Is/has anyone done Christmas Temp work for Royal Mail? What is it like?


I've been invited to a 'registration event for the position of Christmas Casual Glasgow Mail Centre' and I was wondering if anyone has any experience with this job?

There is a post from a few years ago with some details, but no one went into too much detail. Has anyone done this since or is currently doing it right now?

As I understand, it is basically sorting mail or packages by postcode for hours at a time, which I am happy to do.

How long are shifts etc?
Thanks"
"Thoughts on warming a cold cup of tea up in the microwave?


Just did it, as a last resort. 

Made a cuppa, but then someone rang me, and after the call had finished I completely forgot about it. 

Then I got that feeling, we all get, when you realise what you've done. Every cuppa is sacred, so I resurrected it in the microwave. "
