"I calculated that I earn £5.50 an hour (before tax). Is this legal?


Sorry if this is a silly question.

I work in a high-end restaurant in London. I earn £23000 a year and my set hours are 8am to 11pm four days a week and 8am until 3pm on one day (all of these often go on at least an hour later than scheduled). I did a calculation today (23000 divided by 12, divided by 23 days a month, divided by hours) and it come to about £5.53 an hour. That seems pretty low (below minimum wage?) especially as it might fall even lower after tax. Is this typical in the UK?"
"What are some company secrets you can reveal about places you used to or currently work for?


I used to work at nandos and you would be surprised how many blokes would take a girl on a date there, order themselves plain or garlic and herb chicken and ask for us  to stick a hot flag on it.

The mashed potatoes are also microwaved."
"Anyone else just not happy anymore?


Sorry to bring this post up on a glorious Sunday afternoon, but it's been bugging me for a while.

Before anyone says, yes I've seen a GP, therapist and taken medication but none of which has really worked. I wouldn't say I'm severely depressed but I think in general as I've gotten older I've just gotten sadder, I'm in my late 20's.


I hate the restrictions of work. Having to be somewhere and leave that place at a set time, slaving away at something you don't really care for can grind you down. I hate I can't just take 4 weeks off to travel. I've job hopped 5 times since late 2017, and I'm still trying to find something I don't hate.

I don't like this busy sort of lifestyle. The living for the weekend. Nobody has time for anyone anymore. 

I worry. A lot. Since I was a child. I'm beginning to think it's my natural state. As a child I'd hate if my bedtime was a few minutes late, because in my mind I would plan I need this many hours to sleep as that's what's required, before I can go to school. This has carried over to adult life; I can't enjoy the days I have off from work, because I'm worrying about work. I'm surrounded by my lovely family who are very supportive, so I'm not lonely or isolated.

I feel at this age I would have my life sorted by now. I'd be stable career wise in a job I liked earning good money.


I don't know what this post is, it started off as a question and ended as a rant."
"(UK) Renting house through agency, woke up today to a guy in my house?! Is this allowed?


Woke up today to a noise downstairs. Heard someone rummaging around downstairs, thought I was being burgled. Went downstairs to kick some ass, turned out to be an electrician. The estate agents we are renting through had asked him to come over, gave him a key to our place, and didn't even notify us that he was coming. Phoned the estate agents and they were very unsympathetic, the idea of people just turning up and letting themselves in freak me out. The house was untidied, I could have been in the shower, this freaked my wife and I out. Wondering if anyone knows the law on this? Can they just enter without arranging a visit first?"
"Anyone else absolutely fucking dying with the pollen count?


I'm in London and my hayfever symptoms would make you think I am on deaths door. Never been this bad and I'm on 20mg loratadine and 20mg cetirizine. Please can someone else wallow with me?"
"Why does every single tikka masala in a jar taste nothing like every single tikka masala from a restaurant or takeaway?


I’m not expecting Michelin star out of a jar obviously but the flavour tastes nothing like the restaurant versions"
