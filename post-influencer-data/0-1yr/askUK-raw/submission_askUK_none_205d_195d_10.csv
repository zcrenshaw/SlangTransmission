"People who work in charity shops, can you please not write the price inside the book?


I just picked up this copy of Nostromo and on the first page it says ""to my dearest Alda merry Christmas 1904"" then above it says IN FUCKING PEN ""£5"". 

PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE DON'T DO THIS! this book is older than nearly every human alive, it's a piece of history, please don't write the price inside. this physically hurts me. where else can I post this to make sure it never happens again?"
"Your favourite British mannerisms/sayings?


Got a few:

* Asking the taxi driver if they've had a busy night. Saying ""anywhere here's fine"" when they pull up near your house.

* Going wheeeeey when a glass smashes (doesn't happen as much as it used to)

* Going up to someone's table in a pub and asking if anyone's using that chair. 

* Saying ""Right"" before making a decision/leaving somewhere. ""Right, I'd better be off"". 

* Walking down a street and commenting if it ""stinks of weed""."
"Is being made to stand for 8 hour shifts legal?


I work doing watch repair in a retail chain and we initially had 2 chairs, one for each workbench (we have been told they are essential to our work as we need a steady base for repairing watches. Last February our area manager took away one of our chairs to give it to a busier branch that needed it. We made do with one chair between 3 people however in November our remaining chair broke and as such we have had no chair for around 5 months now. We are now all suffering from back and feet pain and we are repeatedly shrugged off when we ask about the replacement chairs.  


What are our legal rights in terms of entitlement to a chair and what steps can we legally take to get a chair back?"
"Why is it legal to have houses for sale for only the over-55s?


I'm looking for a place to buy in my local area at the moment, lots of nice flats in my price range and all of them the same *""over-55s only""*. Meanwhile, flats available to me as an under-55 are at least 10% more expensive and are mouldy crackdens in terrible locations. Seems a bit discriminatory to me.

Can anyone explain how/why this practice is legal?"
"My car was in for repair yesterday, my blackbox shows that the garage took it out to drive without my knowledge and that they were speeding. What should I do?


My car had two worn down wheel bearings and so I sent it for repair yesterday. My car is fitted with a blackbox and records every journey I make. 

As I was checking the blackbox app, I noticed two journeys that were not mine. Additionally I noticed the lowest score possible for “Speed” for that day, indicating that they were exceeding the speed limit while driving. 

I was not informed that they would be driving my car, although I understand the purpose (testing, making sure the problem is fixed). I feel kinda cheated as I have never speeded before and now the journeys are logged into my blackbox and will affect my score. 

Is this considered acceptable and I should let it slide or do I raise an issue with the garage? Thanks for your help in advance. "
