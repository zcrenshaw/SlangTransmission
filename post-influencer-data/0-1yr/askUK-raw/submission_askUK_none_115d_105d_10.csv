"Does anybody find life in the UK to be, well, a little bit depressing?


I am having a bit of a quarter life crisis in that I'm really struggling to come to terms with living in the UK for much longer. 

I've always lived here and there's lots to be grateful for but well, I find it just a little bit depressing. 

Houses are tiny and cramped and almost comical in size compared to other countries, London is great, but obscenely expensive, everywhere bar a few select cities is the same generic retail park copy and paste suburbia, the weather is pretty crap 90% of the time so even nice outdoors is often spoiled. Roads are congested and cramped, everything is becoming more expensive and as time goes on everything just looks, well, a little run down and grimy. 

I'm just finding the UK a depressing place to live at the minute. I know everywhere has its problems but I moved my job down to London so I didn't die in the boredom of suburbia and it hasn't revolutionised much. 

Does anybody else feel this way? I'm close to quitting my job and trying a working holiday in somewhere like Australia just to break the monotony of the grey skies and boring everyday. I know this might be a reflection on me more tha the place but a few friends have randomly brought it up and I realise there's a lot of young people feeling the same way. 

It seems pretty bleak at the moment."
"Is it weird to eat a Lemon?


I'm sat in my office at the moment eating 5 slices of lemon as a snack. Everyone's looking at me in disgust as I happily eat my lemon. After asking around the office I get a 25/75 split of it's Not Weird / Weird.

&amp;#x200B;

Do you think it's weird?"

"What UK celeb gives you an ""off vibe""?


This is a follow up on the [original r/askreddit thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/bw38w0/what_celeb_gives_you_an_off_vibe/) and I am curious to know what r/AskUK thinks about British celebs.

Jimmy Carr is an obvious one and doesn't need any explaining.

Louis Theroux has an 'off vibe' about him too when he pauses during an interview to stare at his interviewee."
"Would anyone mind explaining to this American what exactly is insulting about my name?


Good morning. A handful of times now I've been mocked by supposed Britons about my name, Courtney. ""Benefits street"" seems to be the crux of the insult. I understand it to be a miniseries about people who abuse social aid programs. Essentially what Americans would offensively refer to as a welfare queen, but correct me if I'm mistaken. 

So is it a name that's become synonymous with a sort of sycophantic white trash? Does everyone just happen to know a skanky Courtney? I've always understood it to mean ""of the court"" in Old English (to most Americans 'court' is not exactly somewhere we aspire to spend any time in). I'm fairly amused and quite curious, so please don't hold back if you're kind enough to enlighten me. I appreciate a clever, nuanced jab (when I can understand it) and you are the masters."
"Place I got an interview at contacted my current employer for a reference prior to interview even though I told them not to. Is this normal?


I not only ticked the box to select them not to be contacted but I left another note on the form AND in my email when I sent the form over. Then I get a message today to say my line manager has received a reference request.

Honestly I'm pretty pissed off as I haven't told anyone I'm job hunting and it's just awkward for me as I'm temp anyway. I now am never going to trust the opt out boxes. Can you leave references blank and provide them at a later date?

I'll happily provide one but I'm hesitant to put my current employer down now!

By the way I've emailed them with a ""I'm disappointed"" sort of email. I feel it's important they know."
