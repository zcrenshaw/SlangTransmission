"Any courier service that packages for you?


I've got an item that already comes in a cardboard box but that in itself came to me in another box, so I assume I can't send it off as is. I also don't have any spare boxes that it would fit inside.

Are there any couriers that collect and do the packaging for you?"
"What do northerners think of Southerners? Kent / North Yorkshire


I'm from Kent, so are my family. My family moved to North Yorkshire a year ago after falling in love with the area. Following a break up with my ex I have recently moved in with them until I sort myself out. I've noticed a lot of northerners don't seem to like the southerners, for example when walking in a pub, their accents will go much stronger and I can pick out the occasional word like ""South"" and ""london"" followed by laughter and looks in my direction. I've been told it's because they feel that we unfairly take advantage of the cheaper cost of property. I've also been told that I sound ""posh"" and this has lead to people deciding before they've spoken to me that I'm stuck up. I don't present myself as being better than anybody, I don't act like somebody I'm not either and I've worked since I was 16 so I'm nowhere near posh.

Have I just been unlucky or do I need to accept that I'm not going to be welcome in the area?"
"Can I get a mortgage if I’ve only worked at current job for six months?


I’ve heard/read that you need to be at a job for three years before applying for a mortgage? Is that true or will I be able to get one even though I’ve only been working at current job since last July?"
