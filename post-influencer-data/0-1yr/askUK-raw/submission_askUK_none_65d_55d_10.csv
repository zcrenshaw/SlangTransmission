"Where can I buy cock in the UK?


I had it when I was in holiday in Slovenia and it was delicious, but I can’t find it anywhere in the UK. Never tasted anything quite like it before. I’ve searched for it online and looked for Slovenia and Croatian independent stores but couldn’t find anything"
"I was racially abused today with anti-black(?) terms. I'm white. Then everyone got pissed off at me. What is this? (NSFW?)


I didn't want to put the actual words in the title, but today I was called ""Coon"" and ""Nigger"", then I got thrown out of the shop.

Posted the same on casualuk, but yeah.

&amp;#x200B;

Here's what happened.

&amp;#x200B;

I'd gone to the local newsagents to buy some digestives and some crisps (solid mid-week diet, I know). I was in the queue waiting to be served, whilst the guy at the counter was serving someone else. Only three of us in the queue I think, but others in the shop too.

&amp;#x200B;

At some point, the guy behind me said the word ""Nigger"" on its own while putting his face over my shoulder to say it in my ear. Not quietly, but not super loudly, so I'm sure others must have heard it.  I didn't know if it was just a guy trying to be hard, or if he thought he knew me and did it as a joke, but I didn't wanna be involved, so I just didn't react. I just kind of looked, but then kept facing forwards.

&amp;#x200B;

Then he said ""You fucking bitch"" or something like that. I just kind of looked behind to see what was going on, and it was just some dude stood there staring at me. Kind of uncomfortable and very weirded out, I just turned back around and faced the front of the queue.

&amp;#x200B;

Then something hit me in the side, and I got pushed forward, while the guy called me a bitch.  Think he gave me a dig in the side or something. Immediately I was kind of just taken aback and more ""what the fuck just happened?!"", so I turned around, faced the guy, and said ""Oi, what the fuck are you doing, you absolute dick"". He called me a Coon and shouted Nigger really loudly.

&amp;#x200B;

He pushed me in the chest again, and at this point other people started watching. Now the guy starts shouting about how I called him a Nigger, and he starts shaking the shelf of sweets because he's ""So angry"" I called him racist names. He starts pacing around and grabbing things in anger.

&amp;#x200B;

He gets really agitated and starts pushing me again and shit. Now other people start getting more involved and questioning me. I said I didn't say shit. Other people say they fucking heard it. There's a woman shouting at me about how I'm disgusting and telling me I'm the problem with the country, and the original guy's still raging and pacing around like he needs a shit.

&amp;#x200B;

What the fuck is happening at this point, I have no idea. I'm basically squirming to say I didn't say anything, while aggressively calling the guy a fucking cunt and telling him it's not funny. I get more abuse for abusing the guy, then I get asked to leave the shop and get told I'm not welcome again.

&amp;#x200B;

There's another woman who starts trying to get her phone out to film something, so I quickly bolt because WHAT THE ABSOLUTE FUCK. Imagine seeing the video of that. Zero context, a whole shop calling me racist, and a black guy swearing up and down that I called him a bitch, a nigger, and a coon, and wanted to fight him because of it. Could seriously fuck up a lot for me.

&amp;#x200B;

So I leave, I'm feeling intense shame, I'm absolutely fuming, and I can't go to that shop anymore. Also what if someone in that shop knew my parents or something.

&amp;#x200B;

Seriously this might seem like a really minor issue, but what the absolute fuck do I do? 

&amp;#x200B;

Is this some new kind of ""epic"" trolling? Is this something people should look out for now? I'm still raging. My face is literally hot while typing this shit.

&amp;#x200B;

What the absolute fuck."
"What is it with startups and being up their own backsides?


I just had a phone interview where I was told in no uncertain terms:

\- You'll be working 9-6pm and have to do overtime regularly.

\- The CEO is really precious so you'll need to know the market, our clients and company inside out at the interview.

\- You'll need to be a jack-of-all-trades: great knowledge of SEO, organising events, and be a strong graphic designer.

\- You can't leave within one year or else there'll be hell to pay. 

\- We're already seeing people for second-round interviews and we like a few of them (why is that a good thing for me?).

It's for a marketing job paying 22k (London). The current team is one person and judging by the response to my question, they have no direction other than the CEO's desire to take over the world. Another marketing person just left.

There's so many warning signs but this isn't the first time I've seen something like this."
"Inspired by an earlier post - does anyone cross their 7s?


I'm inclined to believe crossing 7s is a more mainland European thing but interested in how common it is in the UK"
"Windows open or closed?


Yes we know you’ve got AC, not you."
"Temperature inside the workplace is 38.5°C and rising. Is it even legal?


To make it even better, only long sleeve tops are allowed plus eye and head protection must be worn."
"Do you feel like you have a life outside of work?


At the moment I feel like I pretty much live at work, only coming home to eat/sleep/do laundry before going back in. I'm exhausted, never get enough sleep, and have no idea how people manage to maintain hobbies, relationships, and social lives. 

Is this just what working life is like? If you don't feel like this, what's your secret?"
"What businesses do you think might go under soon?


The troubles with House of Frasers that are apparently really hurting Sports Direct lead me to wonder who else may be a high risk?

The PPI companies like Have I Got PPI are an obvious one.

I don't think Giraffe World Kitchen is doing very well either."
