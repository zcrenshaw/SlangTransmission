"Visiting UK - travel advice needed


Hi guys, me and a friend are interested in visiting England for a couple of days in early March. We are mainly interested in visiting Salisbury, famous for its 123m spire. Our plan is to fly into LHW on the 2nd, visit Salisbury for half a day on the 3rd, and then another half a day on the 4th before flying back to our home (Russia). We have booked a hotel in London for the 3 nights. We'll maybe pop round to stone henge but if its muddy at all we won't bother. We've come half way around the world but are far more interested in the world famous 123m spire.

Sounds great right? Totally reasonable for a holiday.

"Did anybody else have bath night?


In primary school i used to only have a bath on Sundays before school, hence bath night. I told my wife and now she thinks I’m a neanderthal. Settle an argument please."
"The UK looks less and less appealing to me as a place to live as a 20-something young adult, can somebody convince me I'm just being moany and it's actually pretty great?


I love the UK, lived here all my life, but as a young adult I'm starting to feel it has less and less to offer.

Houses seem unattainable, baby boomers are the only ones who vote and so government kowtows to their wishes which usually involves only gently prodding BTL landlords, the dream of getting the house my parents own, in a town not particularly remarkable near nothing major,despite earning more than they ever did, seems impossible. 

London is amazing, but the rent there is ridiculous (understandable, because everybody wants to live there), the north is largely abandoned by government investment and so outside of nice pockets it's quite a dire situation of retail parks and industrial work parks. 

Our currency is becoming weaker, and so is our buying power, real wages have stagnated for a long time now, people seem to have a strong crab in bucket mentality. Even getting a train somewhere costs a ridiculous amount of money unless you plan in advance to a ridiculous degree, and god help you if you don't know each individual service's off peak rail times (because of course they can't be standardised) or don't have one of seven tickets because they're only valid with your seat reservation even if you don't take your seat. 

I could just about ope with all this if the weather was good, but I'm also sick to death of just seeing rainy grey skies, we had one good summer and I almost forgot how utterly miserable and depressing it is the rest of the year.

I appreciate i might just be a moany and that everywhere has their problems, but I'd at least rather suffer them in the sun or somewhere that had nice outdoors (weather playing a huge part), than here.

Am I just being moany? Can somebody explain to me why I'm looking at this from a ridiculous perspective? I just really struggle to see my future here and every day friends are quitting their nice jobs and trying their luck abroad because they're sick of it. I have a good job, I'm on a well-desired graduate scheme after smashign top grades throughout school and my life and yet all I have is the prospect of eating on a budget and a measly house share in London to show for it.

Any thoughts welcome, thank you"
"Should we reintroduce bears, wolves and other natural wildlife into the U.K.?


I’ve just seen it on channel 5 that Bristol have plans to introduce brown bears and wolves back into the woods around the city. I think this is a great idea! Even though this isn’t quite what this sub is about I think it’s worth asking as it’s pretty big if it happens. "
