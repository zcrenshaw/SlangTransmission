"employer doesn't give references, what else can i use?


I'm 23, I've been working in retail for 6 years now. I'm a full time supervisor at sainsburys and it's awful, I've been trying to get out of retail for ages now and I have an interview in a couple weeks for a job I want but they want 2 references. Neither of my retail jobs asked for references and neither of them give references either, I've got the work history and duties on my CV but without references to back it up it's pretty useless, like ""oh yes I'm very hard working and learn quickly and do everything my coworkers are supposed to do instead and I have important responsibilities but i can't actually prove that to you or even that I worked there at all, you'll just have to take my word for it"".

I left school 7 years ago and I never made much of an impression on any of my teachers anyway so it's not like I can put them, and I don't have time for volunteering or whatever outside of work so I don't have anything like that i could use. 

I don't know how anyone's ever supposed to make it out of retail when apparently no retailers offer references -\_-

"How important is it to have 3 A-Levels?


I’m (18) studying for my a-levels at the minute, one of which I’m awful at and hate so much I can’t even explain. I’m not going to uni in September, I’m going to college to do a Level 3 art course and then hopefully go to uni after that to do art

If I drop my bad subject will it matter in the long run? I’d rather be able to focus on my other two subjects and get 2 good grades rather than 1 bad and 2 average, which is what I’m looking at right now

"Whey should I get a sofa from?


Currently I have 2 cheap sofas from IKEA. Whilst they were suitable back in the day. however after years of abuse they need to go to the big sofa cloud in the sky.

I've heard that DFS are cowboys and SCS don't have good sofa's

Any suggests to whet I can get a good quality, 3 seater sofa without the hard sales push and 8 weeks waiting for delivery?
