"What are some company “secrets” you can reveal for a company you no longer work for?


Continuing my theme of shamelessly stealing interesting questions from AskReddit to try and get some UK answers!

Having worked at Tesco, those yellow stickers on electrical items that say ""security protected"" are literally just stickers. They wont set off alarms. Or at least, that was the case when i worked there, albeit over a drcade ago"
"What are the most middle class British things?

"What stereotypes relating to the UK do you hate the most?


In my experience, British people are quite sensitive when it comes any generalisations, stereotypes and claims that relate to them. 

I'm curious - which stereotypes or preconceived notions annoy you the most? "
"What would the council tax be on a nuclear bunker?


Let's say hypothetically I buy an underground bunker in a field in Somerset. I want to live in this bunker, hypothetically, to avoid the inevitable apocalypse that is incoming due to the catastrophic effects of global warming. Hypothetically. What would the council tax situation be, hypothetically?

(The council didn't get back to my email.)"
"Someone followed my car for over an hour last night - what do you think his motive was?


I was driving home late last night from a friend's house. I live in a fairly rural place that has virtually no crime. 

I join a road and notice a car gets really close behind me. I think nothing of it. It then turns to a dual carriageway about 5 mins from my house and I see him go in the outside lane as if to overtake whoever he doesn't drive quickly. I was thinking to myself why is he in the faster lane when he's not overtaking. The lane then goes back to 1 lane and he sticks behind me. He keeps slowing down quite a lot then suddenly accelerating really fast behind me.

We enter my village high street which is a 30mph and I go 40 and he stays behind me. This is when I started to think he was following me. I then turn off into a fairly quiet backroad that goes to my house and he continues down there.

They are doing road works near my house and there was a red temporary traffic light. I didn't want to sit behind it with this potentially dodgy man behind and I notice he goes through the red traffic light too. This Is when I was sure he was following me.

I go past my house and decide not to turn into my drive in case he does the same and then he will know where I live. So when I get to the top of the road I live on I continue to drive down other country roads.

He continues to slow down (almost to stopping point) and then speed up loads and follows my every move. I think perhaps he wanted to make me think I had escaped and was out of sight but then see me in the distance so he knows where I go. I decide to just continue to drive as normal as if I was oblivious or not going to play his games.

Because it was night I couldn't see his car from behind me. I couldn't see his number plate or if there were one person or two in the car. The car did seem pretty fast though so I doubt I could've out driven him. My phone had died so I couldn't call the non emergency police either.

I was tempted to pull over and just kind of show I wasn't scared of him at all but then thought he could try mug me, steal my car etc. I'd back myself but then he may have a knife so didn't want to risk it.

I drive a new 67 plate Seat Ibiza. It's not a sports car but is still fairly nice.., probably worth around £10k maybe.

Eventually after him following me for ages (probably just over an hour) and me choosing not to stop or change how I'm driving, he eventually gives up (and perhaps moved on to his next target?).

I then absolutely floor it as fast as I can down country back roads and hair pin turns back to my house. Part of me was worried he would be taking back roads himself to get back to the road I live on (he may have worked out when we went past my house that it was my road).

At one point I did have to stop behind a red light but I had my car in first gear ready to drive off if he jumped out f his car and came up to me. Luckily he didn't do this.

I came home with so much adrenaline. My chest was vibrating and shaking and i couldn't sleep. I'm usually fine in potentially dangerous situations as I'm quite a big guy and usually pretty chilled too. My fight of flight system had definitely kicked in.

I've asked friends and family what they thought his motive was. One person thought he wanted to steal my car, one person thought he was on drugs, one person thought he wanted a race or was just mucking around bored,  one person said insurance fraud. I think the insurance fraud answer may be correct. Maybe he was hoping I would drive erratically like him and then he would crash into me and claim I did it and then claim whip lash etc and make lots of money. What do you reckon? "
