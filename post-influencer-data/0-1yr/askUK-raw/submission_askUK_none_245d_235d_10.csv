"I have started a job a few months ago with some English people and I want to know if what they are telling me is true?


Hello everyone,

I am from the Czech Republic but just started working at a company who's daily language is English. Due to this policy I work with a lot of English people and Americans. However on my team more specifically I have mostly English colleagues.

I have learned a lot of things about England and I want to ask you guys if they are all true.

- People with hyphenated names are ""middle class twats""

Is this true? My colleagues are always saying this when we are on webex and another English guy comes with a name with a hyphen. Why would names change between class? Or are they just messing with me

- My liverpool colleague told me he can hear the difference in someone's accent immediately from Liverpool and can tell me if they are rich and what part of town they are from

Is this really possible? If so that is amazing. His accent by the way is almost impossible for me to understand.

- salaries in the north of England are bad

My colleagues are all from the North and all said they make more money in Prague than they did back home as well has have more job opportunities since they didn't attend university. they have also told me there is less discrimination in the hiring process. I really don't know if I can believe this. while salaries have raised a lot in Prague recently especially in finance and IT i can't imagine they would be better than any part of the UK. 

- How do I answer the question alright?

Do i just say alright back?

I have a lot more questions so I'm sure i'll be back again :)"

"Does anyone know anything about Employment Support/Universal Credit?


 I know very little about these things, but a few months back I was placed on ESA because of a chronic physical illness, genetic disorder (tiredness, pain and difficulty with concentration) and anxiety, which affects me daily. I also have recently begun therapy for anxiety.

On Monday I had an assessment to see if I was fit enough to work. My GP has told me I'm not, I'm on prescribed medication and spend a fortune on over-the-counter medication too. I met with a qualified nurse who noted everything down and told me it was 'the decision-maker' who would decide, not her or another medical professional.

I got a call today saying I'm taken off ESA as of today and if I want to claim anything else, I have to go with Universal Credit (Job Seeker's isn't eligible, don't understand why). I've looked on the site and applied but still unsure on a lot.  


**Some questions:**  
**-**I live with parents but pay rent (cheaper than moving out and I can save up this way), would I be eligible for financial help towards that?  
**-**During the online claim, I was asked to provide a CV, work details and to prove I'm looking for work. The fact is I'm not, because I know I can't work and have explained on the phone/online/in-person that I've had to quit jobs because of my conditions, will this affect me? Don't get me wrong, I want to get back into work I'm not defrauding the system here - but without going into too much detail, sitting upright for even an hour (like a desk chair) can be incredibly painful for me.  
**-**I thought I could appeal the decision from the assessment but was told it was a definite decision, am I mistaken?  
**-**I have a feeling I'll be pushed into work, if I am I'll most likely not last long because minimum 3 days a week I'm physically unwell to the point where I need to be in bed/home, what do I do then?  
**-**I have a doctor's note from a while back regarding my anxiety, but nothing for the other illnesses. I've given DWP permission to access my medical records via my GP, is this enough evidence to prove my illnesses?  
**-**I have an interview tomorrow for Universal Credit (at some point, received 2 emails with different appointment times), will it help my case to bring all medical notes, evidence and medication?  


I'm pretty lost and embarrassed with this whole thing, I'd also not like to go too much into detail about conditions and illnesses so I hope you can all understand my questions and worries!"
