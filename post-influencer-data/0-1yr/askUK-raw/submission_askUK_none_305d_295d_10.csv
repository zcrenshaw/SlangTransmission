"Can you be fired from a temporary position after a serious injury?


I've had a fall from height and broken vertibraes in my back which will leave me sidelined for 6-8 weeks. I recently started a Christmas position at Royal Mail but I'm worried I'll be told I'm to be let go and I really need the work to pay for housing as currently homeless. Has anyone been in a similar situation?"

"My first secret Santa! But what do I do?


So I started my first job this year and I’m now taking part in my first ever secret Santa! The theme we have to follow is it has to begin with the initial of their name. So, the problem is I have no idea what to get my 50 year old female manager who’s name begins with H. Could anybody please recommend? P.s the budget is £15 but I’m not to bothered about going a bit over. Thanks"
