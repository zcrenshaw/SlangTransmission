"In the US, what's something stupid that I can say to my British coworker?


I work with a guy from England who has lived here for a few years; I like to say stuff that makes him look at me like I'm an idiot and then laugh.  
Recently:  
  
I tried to convince him that nobody in England goes to McDonald's and orders fries because everyone calls them chips. He tried to argue, but I think I won.  
  
I started a rumor that he played backup guitar for Oasis during a three month tour in 2011.  
  
Heard 'Let It Be' playing, so I tried to explain to him the history and the cultural relevance of the Beatles.  
  
Yelled across a crowded room ""Bro, did you know that Chevrolet has a soccer team in England? Over here, they only make cars.""  
  
Announced to a group of people ""This dude is so British, I heard him complaining about the queue at Tesco""  
  
So what'd some other dumb shit that I can say to mildly entertain him during his workday?"
"Anyone had the GP just completely blow off your concerns?


I’ve gone to the GP for the first time despite having a couple issues affecting me quite a lot for years that I have just put off but I finally got the balls to go. I get there and explain my issue and he just completely blows it off. His reason is because I’m “young and shouldn’t need to worry” I went in with forearm pain that burns up every time I use it. I can’t write for longer than two minutes. I can barely use my phone or computer. I had to completely stop the gym and tennis because gripping weights and the rackets caused it to burn up massively. I told him all this multiple times and he just kept saying I don’t need to worry cause I’m young. What’s the fucking point in being young if I can barely do anything that I should be able to do. Let alone with uni coming up in scared I won’t be able to physically do the work. I said all this and he gave me some ibu fucking profen and said don’t worry. Should I just make a new appointment and hope I get someone who actually understand? I dunno what to do"
"Why are there guys handing out paper towels and stuff in clubs and bars toilets?


I believe the UK is the only place I've ever seen it. You are into a club and as you go take a piss you stumble upon this dude who's looking like he's the paper towel gatekeeper, and sometimes they got aftershave as well.
Why? What's their role, keeping people from doing drugs I guess? Do you tip them? Talk to them?"
"What's something that screams middle class?


Inspired by the [same question](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/c1trly/whats_something_that_screams_middle_class/) over on /r/AskReddit

In the USA, ""Middle class"" is used to contrast with ""upper class"". It means regular families who are not necessarily financially well-off. It conjures images of Wal-Mart.

In the UK, ""Middle class"" is used to contrast with ""working class"". It has connotations of some amount of wealth. It conjures images of Waitrose.

So, I'm curious to hear answers from UK folks. I also welcome any discussion about my interpretations of ""middle class""."
"Why are British people good at Narrating Stuff?


Like I'm a Black American and all. But God damn, I can Binge watch BBC Documentarys all day while eating food. I can listen to David Attenborough all day, his voice along with the accent is so smooth. What makes British People so good at Narration."
"Driving question, am I doing something wrong here?


This has now happened twice since driving in the UK:

* In a car park with bay parking
* Find a spot
* Put indicator on, same side as spot (I'm still way in front of the spot when the indicator goes on)
* I prefer to reverse into bays so I drive **past** the spot
* Stop, put into reverse, reverse light obviously comes on
* Person driving behind me has now followed me to the point where they are a bit in front of the bay I want to park in
 

I see that they're there but both times they just stayed there not moving, so fuck it I just start reversing, not with the intention of crashing into them but to make it clear -this is what's happening- both times they have then honked their horn at me.

Am I in the wrong here? It so happens both times I held my ground, they ended up reversing out of the way."
