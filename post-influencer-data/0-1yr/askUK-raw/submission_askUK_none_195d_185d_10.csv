"Anyone else in their mid 30's starting to find the passage of time just gut wrenching?


I know it's a cliche and everyone talks about time going too fast and, don't get me wrong, I feel I've filled that time. But as I get closer to 40 (Not that I'm THAT close!!) I'm just finding I get this absolutely pit of my stomach feeling when I come across something that seems like yesterday and realise it was 10+ years ago. Life events, world events that I can remember so clearly that they just don't feel like distant memories.

I think for me, and I don't know how common this is, but I never had good memories from school so it's all a bit of a blur. People add me on Facebook and I have to spend 20 minutes remembering them. But that project I did 15 years ago - Christ, I feel like I can remember every day.

Guess I just wondered how everyone else felt about this stuff?"
"How was the Daily Mail hosting the Christchurch terrorist's manifesto and letting people download it not illegal?


I remember reading this last month - https://www.theregister.co.uk/2019/02/13/uk_counter_terror_act_royal_assent/

I even read a thread on here about it (and about how it was probably a huge over-reach). But how is putting his manifesto up and letting anyone download it not illegal??

Even without the 2019 act, putting it up there is surely illegal under the Terrorism act: https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2006/11/section/2

I don't get it."
"Basic info for a first-time train catcher?


\\ 

Hello,  I want to take a train from Derby -&gt; Leeds, however I have pretty  bad anxiety and worry about a lot of stuff some people can do easily.  Now I want to force myself to go on trains, but don't want to go in  blind.

I'm worried that I will get on  the wrong carriage, how do I know which carriages are going to decouple?  How do I know which carriages are first class? What happens if there's  too many people and all the seats are taken, is it deemed normal to  stand like a bus?

I know it might sound like a stupid question, but it's a real issue for me.

Thanks."
"What businesses are you surprised that are still going?


GAME have been in and out of administration several times and are no longer competitive in terms of pricing. As the industry moves towards more Netflix-like solutions such as with Xbox Game Pass, I can't see them holding out for much longer.

I also wonder how Urban Outfitters are still going. The place just screams nostalgia - once that trend is over, what will they do?"
"Why has the BBC website changed radio to sounds? Which cretin thought that was a good idea?


What do they think they are doing?

I know this is a loaded question, but I feel it needs to be asked...

P.S. if it stops being it being a rant, I genuinely want to know why, it doesn't make sense..."
