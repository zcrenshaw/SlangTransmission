"Best site to find escorts in your local area?


I looked on adult work and there is nothing that takes my fancy. I have a bbw (big and with shape not just 'fat') fetish and there was nothing in my locality that came close to what I was after.

Looked on punternet and again nothing, only a couple of girls.

Where else?"
"Does everyone else call their city centre town?


I'm from Birmingham and everyone I know calls the city centre town ( I do the same). Is this the norm everywhere?"
"Anyone else mostly a cider drinker?


I've always been a cider drinker. It's hard to find ""proper"" cider, but you can't go wrong with a lot of pub ciders, Aspalls, Stowford Press, if you're lucky maybe some Old Rosie. I always find people make a comment saying ""ahh, so you're a cider drinker?"", almost in a derogatory way. In saying that, the only other people I know who mostly drink cider, other than my dad, tend to drink fruity stuff. Don't get me wrong, a Kopparberg in the sun is great, but I love a fresh cold Westons or something.

I do try and drink other drinks, occasionally I'll have some ale, but I've just never enjoyed the taste of lagers and most other beers"
"I have a drinking problem. I need help but I'm scared I'll lose my driving licence if I talk to my GP. Can anybody advise on how to navigate this?


I don't really want to post this but here we are....

(I know it says no medical questions but this isn't really a ""what's wrong with me"" question, more a general ""what might happen if I start the ball rolling"" question)

I'll admit it... I have a drinking problem. I'm not an alcoholic, but I'm definitely dependent on it to help me cope and I probably drink 2-3 pints 4-5 times a week, sat at home. I never drink with mates in a pub, it's always on my own. I use it to numb the emotional stresses of life (of which there are many at the moment), but I don't even enjoy drinking - I enjoy feeling relaxed and then feel guilty afterwards for drinking.

I'm putting weight on (I do a job with a weight limit, and I'm not that far from it) and I go through bouts of eating uncontrollably - but that's a separate issue and I'm probably going to see a psychiatrist privately for that. I'm 17st and the weight limit is just shy of 19st, so I'm getting close to it.

I need to get help and stop drinking. I know I need to. I come from a family of alcoholics on both sides and I know the damage it does, but I'm only 26. I hope I'm not too far down the path to come back from the damage I'm already doing, and enjoy life rather than spending it drunk most evenings, miserable and overweight.

I have mental health problems - in part caused by the alcohol use of my dad. I suffered 10 years of childhood abuse that resulted in a diagnosis of PTSD, and on top of that I'm autistic and I've had severe bouts of depression.

I need my driving licence to work - I don't want to say what I do exactly, but I require my licence to go from job to job and the weight limit is a hard rule due to H&amp;S regs. I get 3 months to get below the limit and if I don't I'm out the door.

I cannot afford to lose it, so I'm terrified of going to my GP and him reporting me to the DVLA because I'll lose my job, and then I'll probably spiral and drink even more than I do now - but if I don't go, I'll keep drinking, putting weight on and I'll lose my job anyway. What will happen if I go to my GP about this? Is he duty bound to report me to the DVLA and so on?

I know this probably sounds like a really pathetic cry for help, and to be honest - it absolutely is. I just don't want to end up like my dad, and his dad and so on, drunk and angry and have nothing to show for their time on this planet. I've worked so hard to build my life up from being homeless at 16, battling severe mental illness and psychiatric problems and I really don't want to lose all I've fought for but I feel like I'm trapped at the moment.

Thank you."
"Are you allowed to bring your own snacks into the movie theatre in the UK?


Saw a post on casualuk saying it was allowed but not sure that is true everywhere?

Specialy in London I feel I have to act like a drugssmuggelar to bring food in.

Is it generaly allowed?"
