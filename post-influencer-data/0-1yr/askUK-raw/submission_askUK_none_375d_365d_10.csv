"Is my boss allowed to ask to see my personal email account on my phone?


Hi all, sorry if the title is a bit confusing. So I'm a care worker and usually get my weekly rota emailed to my personal email on the Thursday before the week starts.

I usually get sent 3-4 rotas on Thursday before receiving the final rota. They will put people down for shifts that they can't do so they have to update it and resend it. As I said this can happen a few times before I get the final finished rota.

My boss sent an email out last week asking us to delete any rotas in my inbox that are older than a month old. I'm reluctant to do this anyway as I like to keep them for my own personal records.

Once every month each care worker will have a short supervision meeting with the care co-ordinator to make sure we're getting on ok. In the email my boss sent he also said that during these meetings the care co-ordinator will ask for me to show them my emails on my phone to make sure I don't have any rotas older than a month.

This doesn't sit well with me and I have a feeling they might not be able to legally enforce that. I know they are due an inspection from CQC soon so I believe this is an attempt to cover up their sloppy rota organisation.

Sorry for the long post, I couldn't find much online regarding personal emails and wondered if anyone else has had a similar experience at work?"

"Is it neglect to not provide a 17 year old with enough food?


I know a 17 year old who is in full time education at college. They're doing a level 3 BTEC plus their gcse maths.

Their mum buys them 4 ready meals a week and expects them to eat half for a meal.

Apparently there's little food in the house. She can usually have some bread/toast during the day. College friends sometimes buy her lunch.

Her mum thinks she should get a job and pay for things. 

Her mum is on benefits but is going on holiday soon, without the teenager. The mum also buys new shoes and handbags etc. But it took over a year before the mum would buy the teenager glasses even though she was getting headaches and her eye test indicated she needs glasses. 

Her mum also has mental health issues. 

The teenager doesn't have any other family in the county.

I'm an adult who knows this teenager. I'm not related nor have any official duty of care. I tutor her maths and feel sorry for her. So we always have dinner before maths! "
