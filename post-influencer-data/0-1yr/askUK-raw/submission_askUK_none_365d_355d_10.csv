"Have you seen this slug?


Hi --

&amp;#x200B;

[I'm looking for this slug, have you seen it?](https://i.imgur.com/yL3fQxV.jpg)  


I'm rather desperate to find *Limax cinereoniger* aka the ash-black slug, aka the largest land slug species in the world! You can recognize this slug because it will probably be chowing down in your garden or perhaps in a nearby park. It can reach 250-300mm in length. It comes in a variety of colours, from black to white to red to beige. It's nocturnal and most likely to be active at dawn or dusk, just after a rain. It's found in the UK but the distribution is unclear to me, and despite having looked in forests, parks and residential areas in London &amp; Cardiff I have been unable to find it!  


I am willing to travel anywhere in the UK to see this slug in person. Please message me with photos if you believe you have found this slug (it's probably easy to confuse with a *Limax maximus*, the leopard slug).   


Thanks!"

Yea. Wassit like to be black out there? America is crazy! I always wonder how other black people around the world think about their social position and whatnot. How you feel about it"
