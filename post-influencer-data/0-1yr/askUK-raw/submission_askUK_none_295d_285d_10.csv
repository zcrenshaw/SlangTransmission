"Why do people so freely speed on the motorway without any concern of being caught speeding?


So for context, when I drive I make use of the 10%+1 ""rule"" and use my sat nav for speed readings rather than the speedometer (for better accuracy).

Despite this, there are always other cars (yes, Audis and BMWs) that are always going at least 10-15mph faster - even in the 50mph roadworks zones with average speed cameras.

Do these drivers literally give no shit about the possibility of getting a speeding ticket, or do they know something I don't?"
"What is a 'normal' Christmas bonus?


I'm really happy with the amount of my Christmas bonus this year and wondered what the standard number is - I've never actually had one before from any previous job, so I'm just interested to know what's normal!  "
"Can I change journey or cancel an advance ticket bought using the Northern Rail app?


I bought a ticket using the Northern Rail app for tomorrow but I need to get a different one an hour or two earlier. There are no options on the app to change it, and in my account it says ""Non-refundable ticket, only valid for the date, time and trains specified"" for that journey. But the NR site says a change of journey can be done: http://northern.custhelp.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/4783

But if you click on it for more information it says ""This answer is no longer available.""

Does anyone know what I can do here? They seem adamant that buying via the app means I can't refund or change it, but if I'd bought this via Trainline.com or some other place could I? 

It's all so frustratingly confusing. It's only a Â£3.20 ticket so not a huge deal if I can't change it but I'd like to know for future situations. "
"Spat on by a kid


So, bit of a backstory....

Was on the bus this morning. Group of young teenagers get on, from the local 'rough' area. They start being generally loud and boisterous, mouthing off at people etc, but nothing too bad, just irritating.

Around 35 minutes later, I'm stood near the front of a now nearly full bus. The teenagers get up to get off, and as just as the doors open, one of them, aged I'd guess 12 or 13, spat directly in my face, and ran off the bus. As they did this, another of them did the same to someone at the bus stop, and they ran off down the road.

I did nothing to provoke them in any way, I didn't even look at them for the entire journey, so it came as a complete shock. 

Now, an hour or so later, I'm questioning how I should have reacted. Had it been an adult that did the same thing, rightly or wrongly, I would have chased them and ended up fighting with them. 

Because they were kids, there's no way I'm going to hit them, but I also feel like they need to learn that they can do this sort of thing without consequences.

So, I'm asking Reddit:

What would you have done?

What would you do now?"
