"What things do you get called a killjoy for hating?


I hate bonfire night. It hurts/scares animals, hurts people, encourages anti-social behaviour, puts pointless extra pressure on emergency services, pollutes the air, litters the ground, the fireworks are probably made in awful conditions somewhere in China. It’s nice that it brings people together and is a big cultural thing but I don’t think it’s worth it. 

What do you hate that others call you a killjoy for, or that as a Brit you are just ‘supposed’ to love?"
"Does anybody else hardly ever take photos while they're on holiday, whether in the UK or abroad?


It was a topic of debate as it's like friends and family always expect you to take pictures while you are away, but then you see some people on Facebook take photos of virtually everything while they're on holiday and it makes you wonder if they're too busy taking pictures to enjoy themselves."
"My address/postcode just points to the centre of my village, and nowhere near my house, so no deliveries can find me. My house has a name and no number, so what do I do?


Moved into a new house a few months ago. Royal Mail manage to find me only because the postman knows the house, but no other courier services, grocery deliveries, or takeaways can ever find my property. If I enter my address in a sat nav or google maps, it just drops the pin in the centre of my village, leaving people driving around just looking for my house name. The road my house is on is the same one that runs through the village. I just wanted to hear any advice people might have.

Thanks in advance!"
"What would happen if Prince Andrew is found to have raped underage girls?


The Epstein case is getting a lot of attention today with the release of documents ordered by the US courts. Prince Andrew is directly implicated in it. 

I'm from the US and am curious what would happen to someone in royalty for something like this. Could he be forced to step down as a prince like a politician in the US would be? 

Can he be charged? I don't really understand what it all entails being a member of the total family."
"Had to put this in AskUK as not sure if this happened anywhere else. Remember when a mobile phone would ring and if it was near a radio or speaker it made that weird electronic noise? That doesn’t happen any more, I haven’t heard it for years . Why did it do it and why has it stopped?


I can’t describe the noise but I’m sure you all know what I mean! Is it down to shielding on phones or frequency changes or reduction in something?"
"Does anybody else just not really enjoy drinking for no other reason than not enjoying drinking?


Bit of an odd one but I was wondering if there are any more people out there. 

It's not that I'm against it for any reason, I don't care what people drink and do and in fact I have spent a fair portion of my teens/early 20s getting into situations where I drank more than I should and I enjoy the bit of a bump you get from two pints or so with friends.

Over the past couple of months however I just never, ever want to do it. Even a pint disturbs my sleep, makes me feel a bit grim and groggy, anything more would give me beer fear the day after and make me feel grim. 

I enjoy all the activities you can do without drink but actually I just don't like it. It's quite weird though, when I tell people they seem shocked and seem to think there must be a reason other than I just don't really like it and would prefer a lemon water. 

I feel like a bit of a chump sometimes saying it but everybody seems shocked, like I've been stricken with an illness."
"What's the worst customer service you've ever experienced in a shop, pub or restaurant?


I'll post mine in the comments."
