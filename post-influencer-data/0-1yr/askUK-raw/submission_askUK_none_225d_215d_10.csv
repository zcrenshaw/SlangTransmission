"Anyone think the amount maintenance loan you get shouldn't depend on how much money your parents make?


Like the the more your parents earn, the less you will get in loans. What of your parents decide to not give you any money? I've had a few friends in the same situation. If you have any stories like this please share...

"What's the biggest cock up you've done at work?


Just for a laugh, what's the worst thing you've done at work?

When I was a posty there were a fair few cock ups, I once delivered a bunch of cards and wished a customer congratulations... Their daughter has died...

Another time I pushed a bunch of mail through and unknown to me there was a ladder leaking up against the door, I tipped the ladder over and it made a horrific crash, but that wasn't my fault it was there. 

Over to you. "
"When are charities going to stop wasting plastic?


This is likely going to be borderline rant, but here goes...

In the last 3 days I've had 7 different charity bags though the door. You all know the ones, save/help (delete as needed) the &lt;insert group of people here&gt;. These bags weigh on average 17g of plastic. Which goes directly to the blue bin. Do not pass Go, do not collect random things from my living room on the way. Sit in the wheelie bin with the rest of the plastic shite that gets collected. 

71g of plastic that is wasted, and that's just my house! I live on a road of about 200 properties, in a town of about 6-7000 properties. Extrapolate the 7 in 3 days to the town, and we've collectively had at least 426kg of these bags dumped in gardens and letterboxes.

The only one of them that said anything about recycled plastic was ONE of them, that said it was made from 20% recycled. So that's then us down to *only* 340kg of these bags if they're all the same. About half (in my area at least) will be recycled, so going on best case scenario, random charities have dumped about 170kg of plastic into landfill, in just my town, in the last 3 days.
I've also tried leaving them out on the collection day (one of them said they were coming back yesterday, loads of full bags were collected, my empty one was left in the same place it was in the morning.) 

In a climate where the average person is being told to use less and less plastic than ever, how exactly do charities think this is OK?

Or does no one actually care, because charities?"
"What would you think about more cats in government?


As you know, there are some government positions in the UK where only cats can fill. Such examples include [the Chief Mouser to the Cabinet Office](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_Mouser_to_the_Cabinet_Office) and the [Chief Mouser to the Foreign Office](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palmerston_(cat)).

So to all the Brits (and Northern Irish) folk on this subreddit, what would you thing about more cats in government? Maybe start a House of Feline Commons? Have Larry form a complete government cabinet of Mouser cats? Should the UK establish more institutions for our feline friends?

Discuss."
"Can I have some advice for my daughter joining the army ?


Hi folks,

Hoping to get some advice from people who have experienced the process of joining the army. My Daughter (16) is set on joining the army and wants to join as a young person and go to AFC Harrogate for a course then into main army.

I was wondering has anyone experienced this and what are your opinions. What happens at the end of the course at Harrogate. Do they move directly into the army from here. Any things I should be aware of as a parent not listed in the info available.

Going to pop into the Army careers place next week while shes on school hols but any info in the meantime would be awesome."
