"Sluttiest clubs in London for students?


Hello guys,

I'll be visiting in December and I'm looking for a good nightclub with a mostly younger/university aged crowd and I really need to get laid.


What would you guys suggest?"
"How can you be protected from call spoofing?


https://www.reddit.com/r/UKPersonalFinance/comments/9ry6zx/scammed_3000_called_from_santanders_bank_phone/

I read this, and am very worried about call spoofing. Anybody can call me pretending to be the emergency services or my bank and because the number looks real, I will fall for it.

Is there any way to avoid call spoofing?"
"Yankee Doodle Dandy


I understand English has change significantly over the past couple centuries, both in the UK and in America, but how is Yankee Doodle Dandy generally interpreted there?

Most Americans  think ""macaroni"" is just a type of pasta, ""doodle"" is something you draw, and ""dandy"" is a synonym for excellent (although often used sarcastically). They mindlessly sing it without understanding its meaning. I know the historical explanation of the terms, but I was curious about the typical modern UK interpretation.

Also, I'm interested in your interpretation of the follow verses of it (taken from the Boy Scouts of American website). 

Yankee Doodle went to town  
A-riding on a pony  
He stuck a feather in his hat  
And called it macaroni

Yankee Doodle, keep it up  
Yankee Doodle dandy  
Mind the music and the step  
and with the girls be handy!

Father and I went down to camp  
Along with Captain Gooding  
And there we saw the men and boys  
As thick as hasty pudding.

And there was Captain Washington  
And gentle folks about him  
They say he's grown so tarnal proud  
He will not ride without them."
