"Do you guys have ranch dressing?


I've been friends with a brit on xbox live for about a year now. We were talking the other day and he said he's never heard of ranch dressing and they don't have it in the UK. Is he pulling my chain or is ranch not really a big thing over there?"
"How do you properly thank a Brit?


Yesterday I posted here asking for happy birthday songs for my sister. We have a long-standing joke about being British (we're not) and talk to each other in terrible British accents regularly. Like really terrible. Sometimes it's actually hard to stop but I digress.

I was posting all over Reddit looking for someone with a *real* British accent to sing her a birthday song, thinking it would make her day. Had a hard time of it until someone pointed me towards r/AskUK. 

You guys came through, big time. I received almost 30 recordings and videos and it made our fucking night. Someone even made one for my mom, who fucking loved watching/listening to these over dinner and post dinner cocktails (her birthday was today). 

I am flabbergasted and thankful. If anyone wants any American candy or whatnot, let me know and I would love to mail it to you. Or pick a charity of your choice and I'll spend a day volunteering for them in the name of Great Britain and all of your beautiful accents. 

Thank you so much and let me know how I can pay you back/pay it forward.

"How come Amazon and Netflix can have videos at 4K, but Now TV caps out at 720p, despite it costing more?


I don't understand why a multi billion pound company wouldn't at least be able to provide full HD resolution."
