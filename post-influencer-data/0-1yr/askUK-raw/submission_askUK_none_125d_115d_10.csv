"I've had to pay to accept a letter disguised as important mail that wasn't posted with stamps, only to find out its an advertisement from a political party. Is there any way i can be compensated?


I went to the post office to retrieve a letter that was disguised as an important document and had to pay to get it because there was no stamps from the sender, and no return address. Upon opening the letter i discovered that it is a leaflet from a political party (Im not sure if im allowed to name them here).

Although it didn't cost much to collect the letter i'd like to try and be compensated out of principle. Should i contact the party and complain or are they legally allowed to do this since technically i had the choice to ignore the letter?

Also, I've read that every political party is allowed to send one letter to each household for free, which might mean it was a fault of the post office, despite the letter having no indication on the envelope of who it was from. In that case, could i be compensated this way instead?

TLDR; I had to pay the post office for a letter that turned out to be an advert, can i be compensated?"

"UK Citizens, what do you think of your national healthcare system as compared to the United States? Do you think it's a good system?


American media is constantly shouting about how much British people hate their healthcare system. About how it's communist and the medical professionals are underpaid. The media also commonly claims that waits are long for all sorts of medical procedures. How true is this in your opinion?"

"Am I the Asshole?


I've lived in a soulless new build monstrosity for the last two years. It's been fine. We were the last house at the end which was great until the bloody developer bought the field next to us and put another 85 houses on it. 

Across from our house there are guest parking spaces. Two of them. Which is great for when guests come over. Everyone has their own driveway for their own cars. However, one of my new neighbors has claimed one of these spaces and has permanently parked his car there. He has a two car driveway already, which is full, and parks his 3rd car in the guest parking. 

It's been parked there without him moving it for almost 3 weeks now. 

Am I an asshole for hating this? They bought a new house with a 2 car driveway and they have 3 cars. Why didn't they buy a suitable house?

I totally get he is parked legally and there is nothing I can do about it. 

I feel like I'm turning into the worst version of myself and plotting to go and park my cars there when he, eventually, actually uses this spare car. 

That wouldn't be totally passive aggressive would it?

I feel better just typing this out. 

Thanks"
