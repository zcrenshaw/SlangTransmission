"Traveling to London, need advice


Hello redditors, 

My sister and I are looking to travel to London, and a couple days in Bath around May. She has been multiple times, but this with be my first trip there. 

Where would you recommend staying for a reasonable amount? Do you recommend a hotel or airbnb? Definitely 2 beds, ideally a separate room. I'm ok with up to around Â£150/night. Somewhere that's central, maybe Westminster?

Also, looking for food recommendations. Only restriction really is shellfish. 

Lastly, looking for a few more places to visit. We are planning to visit Parliament, The British Museum, The Natural History Museum and Westheimer Abby. 

Thank you ahead of time for your input"
"Can my landlord start viewings now? If so, what rights do I have around the viewings happening? (7 months left)


First off, they came today, knocked on my door and TOLD me I have a viewing. I informed them that I wasn't aware of it and they just said ""Well, you should be."" I am aware that the company that owns my flat have emailed me that they will start viewings from the 20th November, but I was under the impression that in order to enter my property they need to let me know with AT LEAST 24 hours notice. They eventually rescinded and left with the prospective tenant (Because I don't think a standoff like that looks good lol) and said that they would go and ""check"" that they had let me know. I triple checked my emails, texts, everything - and they hadn't informed me.

&amp;#x200B;

If I'm honest I feel a little bit threatened. If I wasn't actually in, they would have just entered my apartment and I wouldn't have even known. I'm out a lot, so it's just a complete fluke that I happen to be present on a friday afternoon. 

&amp;#x200B;

Do I have a right to refuse them when they haven't informed me that there is a viewing taking place or was I being an asshole? And secondly, I know that this is unlikely, but do I have a right to prevent these viewings in general? A viewing on the 23rd of November when my tenancy expires on the 31st June seems to set the tone for the next seven months and I feel like that's unfair to me."
"Newbie after Home CCTV advice


I was looking for a camera for the front of my house. It overlooks our off street parking and the road for security, deliveries, etc.

Ideally something pretty idiot and bullet proof. Though I decent at DYI I'm not great at IT. Happy to learn the basics.

If the system could be motion sensitive and keeps film for no more the 48hrs it would be ideal.  Good night resolution but not massive distance need; 10m max.

I've read Arlo cameras could be a good option but really looking for some insight and advice please.

Thanks in advance."
"Why would a driver flash their headlights at a pedestrian walking on the road beside them?


Seems like too simple a question as surely the answer would be to gain their attention. This has been happening to me recently. Where I live I can walk to the local shop in about 10 minutes. There is a stretch of road with no street lighting for approximately 50 metres. I wear trainers with a reflective strip. Normal trousers. Jacket with reflective vest top over this (oversized and should make me very visible). I also have a good torch. 

Tonight I was flashed 4 times. All from cars driving towards me (on opposite side of the road). There were no cars driving on the opposite side of the road at the time i.e. they were not flashing at another car (or indeed anyone behind or in front of me). 

The pavement is wide and well maintained. I walk past others regularly who don't always have any reflective clothing on. Cyclists use the route and often only have their flashing light on the bike and stand out far less than I do. 

Drivers, why do you do this? What are you trying to tell me? I am being as safe as I can be. What gives?"
