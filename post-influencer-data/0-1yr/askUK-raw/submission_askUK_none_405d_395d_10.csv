"What's up with those phone case shops?


Surely they're money laundering?

They seem to operate from shops that have a much larger floor space than is needed for some phone cases. I have never seen anyone go into one, yet there are always a few guys ""working"" (standing around doing nothing because there's not much to do when all you sell is phone cases) in them. Is the demand really that high for phone cases that it's necessary to have huge rooms filled with thousands of them strapped to every free space on the walls? "
"Are GP surgeries everywhere getting worse, or is it just mine?


I've been registered at quite a few surgeries over the past 15 or so years thanks to moving around a lot, and they've always been generally fine, but I've noticed my recent surgery getting substantially worse over the past 3 years. 

It's now almost impossible to get an appointment. You have to phone up between 8 and 10, tell them your problem, which is then sent to the phone ""triage"" doctors who call you back at some indeterminate point before noon and after speaking to you on the phone may or may not offer you an appointment at the surgery over the next 6 hours. This is if you can ever get through, of course. My wife called multiple times this morning and couldn't speak to anyone. Oh, and if you miss the triage doctor's call you're out of luck.

To make things worse, you definitely can't book appointments in advance over the phone or online. You can only do that if you're sitting in the surgery with a GP discussing a recurring issue with them and they offer you a future appointment.

Is this just my GP or is it getting worse everywhere? I don't want to go through the faff of changing GPs if this crap happens elsewhere."
"[Serious] Am I ""allowed"" to call myself English?


I do not have ""white"" skin but I was born in England. I've always called myself British but am I ""allowed"" to call myself English?

I find the idea of calling myself it strange as I associate English with those with ""white skin"".

I'm confused as Brtish and English aren't the same."
