"[Update]I have a drinking problem. I need help but I'm scared I'll lose my driving licence if I talk to my GP. Can anybody advise on how to navigate this?


Evening /r/askuk.

I want to thank each and every one of who you replied to my original post about my drinking to excess. 

I logged out at some point in that evening and then read the whole thing back the day after and honestly, it really, *really* scared me - both what I'd written, what I'd read on /r/stopdrinking and then what people had replied with. People losing friends to drink is awful, but I'd never realised the human impact it has on other people.

I've been sober every day since - the first week and a half was *awful* - genuine withdrawal symptoms and days where all I could think about was drinking. I'm 18 days in and honestly, I've not felt this decent in a long time, nor can I recall the last time I went nearly 3 weeks without a drink. I'm clear headed, I'm motivated, I'm generally feeling better... why do people drink?!

I'm currently away with work in a hotel for a few weeks - no accountability and a lot of drinking by my colleagues, but I'm fighting the temptation. Still thinking about drinking, but the fact I know I'll be disappointed more for drinking than not is helping me.

Not saying I'll never, ever drink again but for the time being it's not for me."
"I am just checking, everyone in this sub knows exactly what I mean when something is on the ""side""?


Some Canadian friends were recently at my place and they asked where the [insert something innocuous] was, I said: ""it's over there on the side"".    
They both looked proper confuckled and said in unison ""the side of what""?    
All UK fold here know what the side is, don't you?"
"How come UK stores put an age limit on 32mg caffeine/100ml ""energy drink"" but no age limit on 50mg caffeine/100 ml Starbucks double-shot with more sugar?


I have always wondered since the stores started putting a 16 years age limit on Energy Drinks, why they didn't also put an age limit on coffee soft-drinks that have a higher concentration of caffeine.

The signs usually mention the high caffeine content, but the logic never seems to be applied to other caffeine products, and sometimes you can even get caffeine **pills** without an age limit. 

Is there an actual law? If so, how does it make a distinction between these two products which seemingly only differ in marketing strategies."
"You’re on your lunch hour, you ordered some food and paid in advance. No sign of the food 40 minutes later and you have to go back to work. What do you do?


They said the food would be 20 minutes.  In fact it was my friend who ordered and paid, I had to unfortunately ditch him to head back to work but he could stay for longer.  When we asked the guy behind the bar said “I’ll just go and check” (I don’t want him to check by that point, 40 minutes is already way too long), and came back with “it’s basically ready” (not sure what that means).  This is a pub in the middle of a city centre.  What would you do?  Especially interested in hearing from the other side of the situation."
