"[Update] How do I (33/f) stop resenting my husband (33/m)?


Original post: https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/bvsdrb/how_do_i_33f_stop_resenting_my_husband_33m/


I first just wanna say thank you to everyone who commented and posted on the last post. There were a lot of great responses that really made me think and helped me make my decision. 

I did a lot of thinking and I realized that I’ve been very unhappy with my husband for a long time but held on because I was hopeful about the person he would become after everything was over and I was hopeful  about what we could be as a married couple and I kept making excuses about his behavior and how he treated me because I “loved” him and felt that that’s what a wife was supposed to do even if it came at my expense for over 11 years. 

 Before I even made the original post, he was incredibly dismissive and whenever we’d be in the same room he’d make a joke out of me being upset at the situation (as usual) and would ask if I was over it yet or say little irritating things that just showed that he didn’t take the issue or me seriously and just expected me to hop on board with being a stay at home mom and quitting my job completely. 

After I made the post I really thought about it and still wanted to leave even after days of weighing my options and the pros of leaving way outweighed the cons and I honestly felt relieved when I thought about not having to be married to him or come home to him and have to be his wife. 

I decided to wait until Friday to talk to him because I wanted to be able to leave for a few days and I didn’t want him to blame me should something happen to one of his patients after we talked. To make this very long story somewhat short, it did not go well at all. I told him, very calmly, that what he said about his job being more important than mine was a shitty thing to say and instantly he downplayed it and fake apologized that “telling the truth made me feel bad about myself.” I tried to remain level headed and discuss the rest of everything and it just overall did not go well. He also accused me of being selfish and unsupportive of his dreams and when I brought up everything I did for him, he told me it was nothing special since that’s what I was supposed to do. And when I asked where were the things he was supposed to do as a husband, he said his being a doctor was his contribution to me, somehow, and that I should be thankful that he’s giving us a great life (a lie). After that, it got really really heated and I told him I wasn’t happy and haven’t been for a long time and that I wasn’t even gonna consider having kids with him unless he got his own serious therapy and we went to couples counseling and were good for a while. He scoffed at the idea and said he didn’t need therapy and just couldn’t believe that I was unhappy when he’s given me everything I could want (a complete lie). And since he was completely unwilling to go to any type of counseling or therapy, I told him I wanted a divorce which made him irate but he later said he could find tons of women who would want to be married to and have babies by a doctor and that they’d be a better mother and wife anyways. I’m going to let him go find that other unfortunate woman to have his babies because I’m done with him and honestly cannot wait to just be away from him. I’ve been at my moms for a day now and he’s been calling but I just want this to be over. I’m sick of being miserable and will begin the process first thing tomorrow. So, yeah. 

TLDR; We’re getting a divorce."
"[Update] I [38F] think my marriage to my husband [42M] is over. I need help.


[Original Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/92333u/i_38f_think_my_marriage_to_my_husband_42m_is_over/)

While my original post didn't get a ton of feedback, I thought I'd update. 

About a month after I posted, I asked him for a separation. He agreed. I moved out and I've got my own place now. I thought maybe moving out would be the wake up call that was needed to save the marriage, but it wasn't. However, it turned out to be the best thing for all of us. 

We share custody of our children, and they transitioned to public school and are doing very, very well. 

I'm doing pretty well, too. It's been hard - and there have been a lot of ups and downs, but it's been worth it. We're all so much happier now, and my ex and I are working really well together to co-parent our kids and we're even friends. We'll always be there for each other, but we're better off apart. 

Not the happy ending that I was hoping for, but a happy ending nonetheless.

TL;DR: We split up, things are good now."
"I [25F] found 582 texts messages between my boyfriend [25M] of 1.5years and another girl, what is the best way to confront him?


I'm just going to dive right in and ask for advice on what to say as I have no idea how to approach this. 

&amp;#x200B;

Last night my boyfriend went for a night on the town with his friend Paul, I didn't hear from him all night which is not unusual as I tend to bother him when hes out with the lads. Paul rang me at 4:30am to ask if my boyfriend had got home yet, to which I replied he had not. The friend told me he wouldn't be much longer as he had just left him in town and that he was walking home (it's less then 2 miles). 

&amp;#x200B;

Boyfriend did not turn up and I was starting to get worried so I tried to call and text him but got no answer, he has a contract phone in my name because i'm stupid.

&amp;#x200B;

 I check on my account on the 02 website as you can see the texts/calls to see the last time he sent a text because I was starting to think something may of happened to him. I was scrolling through and recognised some of the numbers that came up but 1 stood out, he has sent 582 text messages to the same number between 17th April and 18th May. I thought that was an extremely high amount of texts to send, so I save the number in my phone and check WhatsApp - low and behold its a girl I have never met or know anything about. 

&amp;#x200B;

I have been re-reading the texts between me and boyfriend, 3 occasions between 17th April - 18th May he told me he was staying at Pauls house but when I have checked the dates on the texts he has been sending texts to Paul but not the mystery girl, so it is clear he has actually stayed at her house. 

&amp;#x200B;

He eventually called me an hour ago to say he went back to Paul's house last night, which i know is a lie because i was on facetime with Paul at 4:30am while he was walking home and he was alone. I did not say anything on that call and he said he would be home soon, I called him back to confront him but hung up as I want to do it face to face - he called me back just now to say that he is out having breakfast with Paul and that he would make his own way home around tea time ish (this strikes me as odd, thinking back he has always declined my offer to pick him up on these 3 occasions but every other time he will ask me to take him somewhere as he does not drive). 

&amp;#x200B;

When he comes back later today, how should i approach the situation? He currently lives with me, do i pack up his stuff? Please, any help would be appreciated

TL;DR - found 582 messages between boyfriend and a girl I don't know, I know but cannot prove that he has been with her on multiple occasions, not sure how to confront him"
"I [29/F] think I need to leave my bf[31/M] of 8 years, because a proposal is likely to never happen and I've become resentful.


My bf and I have been together for 8 years. During this time I have brought up on numerous occasions that marriage is something I want one day. When I would bring up these conversations my bf would agree that is something he would want one day too. 

At first I wasn't too concerned that he never talked about marriage because we were fairly young, it wasn't something I needed immediately. I figured if I just waited patiently, he'd start bringing it up on his own, and things would progress naturally. 


Well, they didn't. Probably around two years ago I started talking to him about how I wanted to get married one day and I'd try to talk to him about timelines. I'd share mine with him, and he'd always just kind of agree or say he never really thought about it. 

I'd get sad that he'd never bring up the topic of marriage and ask him why he never brought it up. His answers would change from he just didn't think about it, to he does think about it, he just can't answer any questions or give any specifics as to what he thinks about. 

I'd tell him how much it hurt me and that I want to be with someone who WANTS me and that for me to marry him one day I'd need him to WANT to marry me, to take initiative and show me he wants it to by sometimes brining it up on his own. HE. NEVER. WOULD. despite agreeing too. Despite agreeing that he wants a future with me. 


I'd get sad. I'd cry. I'd tell him that I feel like I'm nagging him and I refuse to marry someone I had to nag into submission. He still would do and say nothing. 


I brought it up two weeks ago and almost broke up with him. We agreed to do counseling. And then the next day his best friend who has been with his girlfriend for maybe two years proposed to his girlfriend. My boyfriend told me that his best friend had been talking to him about it and asking him questions. I asked my boyfriend if talking to his friend and helping him decide whether or not to propose made him think about us, or our situation. He said no. He fucking said no. 


I just can't take it anymore. He'll say he loves me and can't imagine a life without me but then he does absolutely nothing. I try so hard to tell him exactly how I'm feeling so he doesn't have to try to read my mind.... and still...fucking nothing. I'm not even asking for a proposal right now. Just the fucking gesture that he thinks about it, and wants it, to give me some sort of assurance that this is going somewhere.


I've told him, if I keep having to nag him into loving me, he is going to ruin it. And I think he has. He was going to start looking for a counselor this Friday but fuck at this point I don't know that'll do any good. I feel so horrible that I have to get a counselor to get my boyfriend of 8 god damn years to tell me he wants to marry me one day, unprompted by me. 

People do things they want to do. People talk about things they think about. He doesn't do or say anything but he'll tell me he does but then be unable to provide any specifics. Is he a liar? Why lie about that? How evil would you have to be to keep using someone like that? To watch them continually suffer and then do fucking nothing about it but string them along and lie to them.

Oh and for people that are all why don't you propose to him? I've done everything in this relationship. I asked him out. I told him I loved him first. I plan our dates. I got us to move in together. I just wanted him to take initiative on this one thing so that I could feel like everything wasn't one sided, and yes, I've expressed that to him sooooooo many times. 

TL;DR BF of 8 years never brings up the topic of marriage or wanting to marry me, but will say he wants to marry me one day if I ask him, but he can never provide any clear details on anything. I'm so hurt I think it's beyond repair at this point and don't know what to do."
"My husband [41m] simply will not have sex with me [30f], I can’t talk to anyone about this and I feel so alone and ugly.


I’m in tears here because I just don’t know what to do anymore. When I got pregnant my husband went off sex. I tried to talk to him about it but didn’t want to pressure him so stopped talking about it all together after he assured me he simply did not want pregnant sex. 
 
Baby is now 7 months old and we’ve had sex maybe twice since she was born and both times were instigated by me. 

I’ve asked him outright what the problem is and he says there isn’t one, if pressed he just says he’s tired. 

I’ve hinted to him and he just ignored the hints and will quickly say he needs to do something else like clean the kitchen or something - anything to get away from me. 

I’ve purposely not mentioned it for weeks to see if he initiates and nothing happens. 

I’ve spoken to him about mental health post baby and he again says he’s fine, just tired. 

I’ve cut to the chase and said “hey do you want to have some fun later?” And he literally says “what, like a board game?” And I’ve said “no, I mean sex” and he makes an excuse as to why we can’t or he’ll purposely misunderstand what I say. 

I don’t want to pressure him. I shouldn’t have to pressure him. 

This is completely soul destroying. I want to feel wanted, I want him to find me attractive. I want to be passionate again. I want him to find me as sexy as I find him. But he doesn’t. I feel like some desperate little girl begging to be found attractive. 

I can’t do it. we’re best friends but we’re not lovers. What are my choices? Is it fair to deliver an ultimatum? What can I do? I don’t want a sexless marriage, I need to have intimacy. Am I crazy to expect sex in a marriage? Please don’t tell me to communicate, I’ve communicated to death in many different ways and he won’t even touch me. This is a deal breaker to me. 

TLDR: husband won’t have sex with me. Don’t know what to do anymore."
"I (24F) found a thong that is not mine in my boyfriend’s (24m) jacket pocket.


I’m on maternity leave right now ( four our second child) and have been trying to catch up on laundry today. 

I was about to put the last load in and gathered his things when I noticed a clump of something in his jacket pocket. It was a Victoria’s Secret black thong size medium which is not my thong and not my size and wouldn’t be his size either. I know it’s not his and I know it’s not mine. 

I immediately confronted him over text. I sent him a picture of the throng and said “What the fuck are these doing in your pocket.”

I should of waited because I feel like I gave him enough time to make a lame excuse. He said they were his ex girlfriends ( from 6 years ago) and he just found them in our dresser and was going to throw them away. 

What I know is that this is a complete lie. We just got a new dresser from American Furniture Warehouse a week before our baby was born and he is two weeks old right now. I also did our laundry for the past five years of us living together with our old dresser and these were never in there. Also why would they be in his pocket? 

It’s just a dumb lie. I just want him to tell me the truth. I don’t know what to do because we just had our second child and I live and work in a very expensive town and part of Colorado. I can not afford to just pick up and leave and don’t really have anywhere to go. 

tl;dr
Am I being unreasonable? Part of me wants to believe him because I don’t want this to be true. But I’m not stupid.
Also he gave me his ex girlfriends number and told me to text her and ask if they are hers but I feel like that’s really weird to do..."
"[Update] I contacted CPS to keep my friend's son safe and she fled the state.

I want my post didn't get a lot of attention I wanted to update for my peace of mind. 

Jess called me 26 times last night after me going no-contact since my first post. She has been constantly texting me horrible things (I hope you die, your abusive ex should have killed you, you ruined my son's life, etc). Although I am a devistated, I have held my ground. 

Jess fled to Florida last week and I have no idea what is happening now. 

I'm also not sure if I mentioned this in the last post, but Jess is sleeping with our (married) local prosecutor (who has pulled legal strings for her countless times) and I think that he will get involved with whatever CPS is trying to do. 

I feel hopeless so I blocked Jess's contact info, and am keeping records to hand to the investigator involved with her son's case. I can't do anything else currently and it hurts. 

I'm not sure if they'll be returning back to my state, I'm not sure if she is using with her son around. 

I feel lost and I wish I could help, but I can't. I'm just trying to accept that and do what I can. 

TLDR: My friend is ill. I filed a CPS claim after her abusive partner attacked her in front of their son. My friend blamed me and has been blowing up my phone constantly. She fled the state yesterday and I feel hopeless."
"Wife [25f] seems to feel like she's the only one allowed to have a rough day at work, and it is kinda getting on my [28m] nerves.


I met Amber six years ago in Afghanistan, we've been married about 41/2 years now.

Our relationship is mostly fine, but I'm getting annoyed that she seems to feel like she is the only one who has bad days at work and can come home and complain about it.

Don't get me wrong, Amber's job is stressful as fuck. She's a helicopter mechanic, so she has long hours, lots of labor intensive tasks, she's responsible for people underneath her, and I totally get that some days are gonna completely suck and she needs to come home and vent about it.

On those days she comes home and vents about her people, her job, her hours, whatever, I try to listen and let her get it out of her system or go rest or whatever.

That is all completely fine.

But my job is also stressful as fuck. I'm a wheeled vehicle mechanic, I also work long hours with alot of muscle power, I'm reponsible for people, so I have alot of days that suck too.

But when I get home and want to vent she just brushes it all off. If I complain about some pain in the ass job that day shell tell me ""Well *I* had to do [whatever] today!"" 

And she always talks about how exhausted she is at the end of the day because she ""Had to pull the engine out of a Blackhawk"" that day (or something) and needs to rest, so I'm left with figuring out dinner or cleaning the house. And I don't want to start going tit for tat, but I'm like ""Y'know, I had to go pull a wrecked cargo truck out of the mud today, so I'm *pretty fucking tired* too.""

I don't mind taking care of stuff so she can chill after a rough day sometimes, but when I get back after a bad day and just want to take it easy, she'll be at the bedroom door every ten minutes because she needs me to go take care of this or that, or run to the store, or help with dinner.

Most of the time she is fine and helps around the house and all. But she has her bad days sometimes and I go out of my way to let her decompress and chill, but if I have a bad day I'm supposed to get over it, and her whole attitude is ""Well toughen up buttercup"".

And I mentioned this little double standard once and she told me a bad day is worse for her because ""At least your trucks don't fall out of the sky if you mess up"" and I was so frustrated with that statement I had to walk away for a few minutes.

I don't want to burn the marriage down, but this is seriously annoying me and I want to fix it. How can I address this stuff? I don't mind helping her out, but I really need some reciprocation now and then.

**TL;DR** Wife has a bad day at work and I try to help her destress and feel better. I have a bad day and she expect me to get over it. It drives me nuts. Help?"
"UPDATE Wanted to say thank you to the people of this board after a two-year process finally came through.(24M) - (28F)


 

&amp;#x200B;

[https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/5mtrcw/i21m\_think\_that\_my\_best\_friend\_25f\_of\_12\_years\_is/](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/5mtrcw/i21m_think_that_my_best_friend_25f_of_12_years_is/)

About two years ago I posted this on this board and got several PM's from you guys about what to do and how to handle it. Needless to say I was an idiot and continued to put up with it, moving into a bigger apartment where I could have my own room and such but as of two days ago I was finally able to cut this person off, I am on my own, I don't have any inclination to worry about how they're doing.

I...can afford to live on my own with a new promotion from work. I have a yard/garage to my own. I've adopted a kitten as a roommate replacement.

And I have never been more thankful for the fact that you guys were supportive back then and I have never felt better.  


TL;DR You guys were right, I feel great, thank you."
"[24M] Someone I thought was my friend threw a party, and invited (literally) all my friends but me. I’m sitting alone looking at multiple friends social media posts of the event and I haven’t felt this isolated since I was 14.


Title says it well. The past two years have been really difficult for me, but today might be the hardest I’ve been hit by it. 

When I graduated from undergrad, I was at the top of the food chain socially and my social confidence had never been higher. Things changed once I entered grad school (in the same city I lived in for undergrad) - for some reason, I couldn’t really connect with the other students (who mostly older than me) and I failed to find *any* friends who I’d see outside of class. On top of that, my friends from the past slowly started falling away from me, but not from each other. People I’d see every week slowly became friends I’d see once a month, if that. This has all made me feel completely broken and ruined my self esteem and confidence. 

Today is the worst example of that. Literally all the friends I had left in town were invited to another “friend’s” going away party. I know they deliberately excluded me because this isn’t the first time that “friend” has failed to invite me to a social gathering, despite the fact that I regularly tried to include him in get togethers and the like. Plus, all my other friends who are there haven’t even talked to me in a week. Now I’m being treated to snaps and Instagram stories of them having a blast together at a Beach BBQ literally a mile from my house.

I feel trapped in my life and I don’t know where to go from here. I feel like my once vibrant personality has been ruined, and the results have been my almost complete isolation from the people I care about. What can I do to fix myself and feel normal again?

TL; DR: Being left out by all my friends has caused me to feel broken, where can I go from here?"
"My boyfriend(22M) is concerned that other guys masturbate to the thought of me(21F)


I’ve been with my boyfriend for about 5 months now and he’s starting to show signs of being insecure. I consider myself to be someone who is comfortable with their body. I like to dress cute and often times wear tops that show cleavage. I noticed my boyfriend got uncomfortable when I showed up to his apartment with no bra on (the shirt I was wearing would of shown my bra straps so I just decided not to wear one). He’s mentioned to me that our coworkers and his friends find me attractive. He’s told me not to wear what I like anymore or present myself in a certain way because he’s afraid that other men are getting off on my looks. How is any of this actually my fault? I’m definitely not willing to change how I dress because I don’t think it’s a big deal. Why should I be concerned that people find me attractive and could possibly masturbate because of me? I feel like that’s just out of my control. He’s made me feel like my body is wrong and that it’s something I should be uncomfortable about. My boyfriend seems to be so fixated on the thought of other men getting off to me that it’s putting a wedge in our relationship. I don’t know what to do about this! Have any of you guys had this problem and how did you go about it? 

TL;DR my boyfriend is concerned that other guys masturbate at the thought of me and I’m not sure how I should respond to that."
"I [21F] am feeling suffocated by my friend’s [20F] constant talk about her abuse.


My friend and I have both experienced child abuse. I no longer live with my abuser and am in the process of recovery by going to therapy and putting distance between us. My friend does still live with her abuser and is not doing anything for healing.

Our trauma was something we bonded over in the beginning of our friendship. It was the first time either of us were able to talk openly about it, which was very helpful. I stopped talking about it after a month or two, but was always ok with listening to my friend vent when she needed to. I always offer her advice and try to help her through it when something is going on. More often than not she doesn’t take the advice but that’s understandable considering her situation.

Over time though, it’s become harder and harder to listen to her talk about it. It’s frustrating to hear her complain about the same thing, ignore any advice, and make choices that actively hurt her. I hate to listen to her talk about her abuse and abuser also, because it’s very similar to mine. For a while it was the only thing she talked about-every day she would go “so guess what my dad said to me last night...”

Sometimes she would send me screenshots of their conversations with no caption. I would try to comfort her and she would respond, literally, with “...” and I wouldn’t know what to say. I stopped responding to those kinds of texts after a while. It was triggering for me to read, especially when I was dealing with the rough parts of my own therapy. I told her it was stressful for me to hear about her dad. 

Occasionally she would realize it was bothering me and send me guilty messages about what a bad friend she was, and then I would have to comfort her again. Admitting that she had upset me made her shut down. 

The other day I forgot to reply to one of her messages about her dad and she started posting about “when people ignore your messages” on her social media. I saw the story and responded to her message, and she replied with a screenshot of my view on her story. I apologized and told her why I don’t respond right away to those messages and she said she was kidding, then updated her story with “got em”. I felt so manipulated and stopped texting her. 

I feel like over time she’s just getting worse about it, and I’m losing my patience more. I don’t want to cut this off completely, she’s like a sister to me and I know I’m the only one that she can talk to about this (besides a therapist 🙄). We’re rooming together next year and I don’t want things to be uncomfortable, but this has to stop. What do I tell her?

TL;DR: My friend’s constant talk about her abusive parent is stressing me out and getting in the way of my own healing and our friendship. How do I get her to tone it back?"
"My dad paid my cousins’ tuitions... three of them. My brothers and I are incredibly hurt, and not sure how to handles this.


So a few days ago, I received a message from an auntie that (summarized) said I was a very resourceful girl, can always find a job, why would I rely on my dad for the last quarter (October to December) of my school year for money? At first, I was a bit mystified, because how does she know I need my parents to support me for those specific months until my funds renew in January 2020? And... what does it have to do with her? But she was always the type to try and stick her nose in my business, so I tell her that my parents offered, especially since I am doing my masters abroad. She said my dad has been paying my cousins’ undergrad tuition the whole time. Two have already graduated (one of them just graduated a few days ago) and the last of them is about to start her final year. Apparently my dad told my auntie he won’t pay for it because I (yenno, his daughter) need the money instead. She did not like this. Joke is on her though, my second year, I’m getting a job but still need my parents for the end of the year again. 

At the same time, my just-graduated cousin messages us on the family’s cousin group chat saying she just found out my dad paid off her tuition, she thought it was her parents the whole time (hah, impossible, her dad has never had steady work. But his kids think he’s an angel). She praised my dad on the chat, and all my cousins went all “Wow” “that’s amazing”, except my brothers.... They went “wait, what?”

Because see, my brothers and I have been working since we were 15 (did flyers or chores in the neighborhood before that). Sometimes we held down 2 jobs while doing full time uni just to make ends meet. My cousins have NEVER had a job, EVER. They’ve never had days where they were up for over 30 hours because of work and assignments. They’ve never worked 50-60 hours a week to make tuition payments. My brother was unable to find work in his field for 2 years, and despite him taking on a few part time jobs to stay afloat, his student loan payments piled up. Sure would have been nice to have a loan to pay those until he found something suitable. 

I asked my mom about this (I was kind of hoping there was some misunderstanding), and she lost her shit because she didn’t give my dad permission to use their money (they both work) for his sister’s kids. In fact my mom is livid that her kids have massive student loan debt, and our cousins don’t. Especially since my auntie has always mocked my mom and I for working (she genuinely thinks women should never work outside of the house, or they’re not “ladies”). To make things worse, before my brother and I accepted our masters degree offers, we went through my parent’s finances to make sure they could cosign a student line of credit for us. It should have been no problem, but the bank rejected it. We thought this was odd back then, as we should be comfortable middle class by now (used to be dirt poor yay). But nope, turns out my dad failed to mention the line of credit he took out to pay my cousins’ tuitions. We didn’t know this then, but we know that now.

So long story short, we are so hurt. We have no right to my parent’s money (my dad is in deep shit with my mum, but that’s between them), but you would think you’d help your kids first? My dad has tried calling me a few times, but I said I’m busy. My brothers are avoiding him too so he sent us a message saying he knows we’re disappointed in him, but he gave that money to my cousins because unlike us, they don’t work, and their dad is not trustworthy. He makes it sound like we WANTED to work so much because it was SO FUN. Who knew being unemployed was the way to go? My cousins apparently.

Being mad at my dad for this, logically, feels wrong... but emotionally.... we’re fuming. Logically, some people have less, it’s NOT our money, and we’re lucky to have what we have. But... kind of guts us that my dad didn’t ease our hardships when he could have. Sucks that he didn’t think we were worth the investment. It’s a really bitter feeling. I feel especially bad for my big brother. 

I don’t know how to navigate this situation. Do we just swallow our hurt, because there’s nothing to forgive? Or are we somewhat justified? It would have been easier to accept if my cousins worked, but they DIDN’T. Every time I remember that fact, I get angry and hurt all over again. We told my mom to tell our dad not to talk to us for a while, but he feels like this is unfair treatment. I don’t know... is it? Are we being spoiled brats, reddit? We love our dad, we’re not going to ditch my parents or anything like that. But we’re feeling a level of animosity for him now.

Oh and I almost forgot the cherry on top. My cousins are 2 girls and 1 boy. The girls have a line of thinking similar to their mum. In fact the one that graduated won’t even use her degree, she’d rather volunteer casually because “ladies don’t work”. Her degree is just to make her more appealing to potential partners. Same for her sister who will graduate in a year. No I’m not joking. 

TL:DR: my dad paid for my cousins’ tuitions (yes plural), but not ours, his kids. We’re very hurt by this. Asked for no contact for a while but he feels it’s unfair. How do we navigate this situation and deal with the hurt?"
"I (33 F) pretty confident my hubby (35 M) is cheating... Gold heart in Snapchat plus flames isn't helping.


I've been with my husband for 15 years. Recently he started talking about about this girl he met. He only knows her because she waitresses at a restaurant he goes to lots (literally, that is it) and then one night he told me he invited her and her family over for a backyard fire. I was shocked when she was dropped off alone with her daughter.

I totally felt like a third wheel, and judging by the conversations, it sounded like they knew eachother more than he let on. Then, he turned to her and asked if she wanted to get high! She agreed and they both walked away, leaving me alone with the kids, while they both got high in our garage together!

I thought this was incredibly inappropriate and rude and he was acting like it was totally ok. 

That weekend, after the fell asleep, I decided to do some digging. His phone is always on lockdown but I managed to get in. I saw a message from her in Snapchat saying goodnight, then I noticed that they are on a 12 day snap streak, along with a nice gold heart. WTF!!!

I can't even believe how inappropriate this all is, and he is acting like it's all cool! Not sure how to approach this! Any advice?!

TL;DR - husband Snapchatting with his waitress friend nonstop in secret. Need advice!!"
"My (49F) Sister (39F) is being ugly towards my daughter (23F) for problems that stem from her choices.


Sorry if this is all wrong, my husband suggested that I post here for an outside prospective.

&amp;#x200B;

My sister, A, is my only other sibling. Being ten years apart, we were not always close. She was always my sister, though, so I tried to take care of her. Our parents weren't the greatest. As my sister got older, they would, in a way, pit us against each other. We would both enter baking competitions and my mom would openly cheer for only one of us based on what we both entered. Or they would threaten either of us when we were growing up that we would not be given the family business. Our parents made it clear they would only give ONE of us the family business and would decide upon my sister's 18th birthday.

&amp;#x200B;

By the time my sister turned 18, I had been married for five years and had a son (now 25M) and my daughter (now 23F). They were my world and I had pursued a career in the dental field as a hygienist. My parents decided since my sister was a ""clean slate"" that she would get the family business. My husband and I attempted to purchase equity, but my parents told me I should have done that in high school. (Though, what high schooler was thinking of investing in equity?) I decided that it wasn't going to bother me. I had a beautiful family, I loved my job, and my husband and I were comfortable financially. In the long run, I think the business would have complicated things for us.

&amp;#x200B;

Just only a year later, my sister married a man she met in one of her classes at business school. They had only known each for twelve weeks and married before the semester was even over. Just six months later, she was pregnant with her first daughter. Because of doing all of this before her 20th birthday, my parents decided to take the business away from her and they sold it to my mom's brother. My uncle was a bit more gracious and offered my husband and I an equity stake for an investment, which we gladly did then, making us 20% owners. My children would work at the business on the weekend cleaning and answering phones. My husband and I pitched in when we could. My sister refused to have any part of it at that point and decided to follow her lifelong dream of becoming an author while her husband did full-time work. 

&amp;#x200B;

My sister ended up having two more children before she was 25. Because they had three kids, her husband asked her to go back to school or work to help support the family. She was extremely combative. Her husband even called me once to ask to talk sense into her about her ""writing career"". She had been pursuing the idea for the last six years when the children had been born and her husband said that she wasn't even willing to share any writing with him and he was beginning to doubt she had even managed to stitch a book together. I had a ""come to Jesus"" talk with her about her family coming first. I shared my experience of having kids and getting pulled together.

&amp;#x200B;

My sister went back to school for an english degree. My family encouraged her to become a teacher but she said absolutely not and did not graduate with a teaching certificate. She was certain she would get loads of job offers in the publishing house realm, but she did not receive a single interview, so she went to work in a book store as a cashier, which she was not happy about. I kept telling her to get a teaching degree but she said no, it wasn't what she wanted to do. I was flabbergasted because how could being a cashier for just above minimum wage be any better? She insisted she had lots of down time and was able to work on that novel that she had dreamed about for nearly a decade at this point.

&amp;#x200B;

Finally, in 2010, my sister's husband got a well paying job and she quit her's to return to writing. Just a year later, she finally announced she had finished her novel, was writing query letters, and preparing to be published. She received just ONE rejection and threw a huge fit about no one recognizing her genius. So, she decided to self-publish the book. She paid a lot of money out in editing and printing. Her husband and her fought over the money for a long time and I was fearful they would get divorced. I was even more worried for my niece and nephews, who were caught in the middle of all of it. My sister decided to throw a big gala downtown for her self-published book to help promote it. She paid for FIVE HUNDRED copies of her book. Mainly family came to the gala, not a lot from the industry, which she expressed disappointment in. Only thirty-five books were sold, so she started going to author trade shows and book conventions. I went and sat at her booth for 90% of these events with her, because I was proud she was going to push herself into the writing world and perhaps go from paying for her work to getting paid for her work. I do not in any way look down on self-published authors, but in her economic situation, she should have known she couldn't really afford to self-publish. Just with her first book alone, printing, editing, and perfecting, she paid nearly 5k and she took it out of the family's saving account, which led to more arguments with her husband.

&amp;#x200B;

Just a year and a half after her first novel, she finished another. I told her that she could have a good chance since she had written an entire novel and had more experience. She didn't even attempt to send it to publishers or agents. She immediately went to self-publishing again and has sold less than 100 copies of the books to date. Her books are even listed as free on Amazon Kindle. She fell into a pit of despair, claiming no one knew good writing when they saw it anymore. She still continued to go to trade shows and conventions, and I continued to go and support her.

&amp;#x200B;

Fast forward to today, my sister has self-published four more books that have all done just about the same in mediocre sales. She's not breaking even on her writing. She's losing money and I'm surprised her husband hasn't cut the plug. He told me at a family member's birthday party that he quit asking and supporting her about it. He's hoping that her ""writing bug"" will go away and she will try to pursue work in her degree field again.

&amp;#x200B;

My daughter, K, ended up being very similar to my sister in mannerisms. Quiet, polite, and very artistically inclined. She began writing short stories after she was taught to write. My daughter, though, was a bit more grounded to the earth, and pursued a science degree and works in a lab as a tech assistant since graduating a year ago. She writes on the side, mostly for fun. But for the past year and a half, my daughter had been writing a fantasy novel, and would send chapters to her brother, father, and I, and friends for constructive criticism, feed back, and error catching. Once she finished it, she submitted it to a publishing company and was denied. She rewrote a lot of the book and tried again, and six months ago, a rather large publishing firm agreed to publish it for her. We were absolutely ecstatic for my daughter. She wouldn't make a lot of money, but she would be allowed to retain all rights and give a nice chunk of money for her savings account. 

&amp;#x200B;

Upon hearing the news my daughter was getting published, my sister's attitude completely changed. We had a ""Good Job"" celebratory party for my daughter at our house and the entire time, my sister was sitting in a recliner with a glass of wine, nearly glaring at my daughter. I tried talking to her about it. She said very nasty things like why would they pick a young and inexperienced girl over her, who had over a decade experience in the writing world. My sister and daughter write in widely different genres. My sister does romance novels, similar to what you'd find at the airport, while my daughter writes fantasy and science fiction. I tried to use the moment to encourage my sister to research the market and try writing in a genre that was more active and popular. She said no way and insisted my daughter wrote fantasy just to sell out and look good in the community.

&amp;#x200B;

We are to the final days of the publishing house fixing and working with my daughter and her novel. My daughter is so happy and I am so proud of her. She already is in works for a second novel, which the publishing company is expressing interest in. I'm thinking she may actually be able to start making a living off of it, but my daughter wants to stay in her field for now, which I think is a very adult and mature decision.

&amp;#x200B;

The main problem is... now that the deal is about to go through, my sister has told me she should get a small percentage of my daughter's earnings because she ""influenced her"". That is not true in the least. My sister had little to do with my daughter growing up, mostly because she was only a teenager when she was born. If her cousins came over, my sister would stay home to write or go to our office to write while I watched all five of the kids. My sister thinks that my daughter saw her writing as a child and was inspired to do it herself. My daughter wrote her first short story about a rabbit in kindergarten and then all throughout school participated in writing clubs and contests. I think it was naturally in my daughter's blood to write and feel that very little was influenced by my sister. My sister is so protective of her work, anyway, that she's unwilling to share any detail about the book before it's finished, so how would she influence my daughter if she never talked about it with any of us besides talking about the ""glamorous"" lifestyle an author can live. (Reality check, please.) My daughter had attended the party events, conventions, and trade shows, but that's because she's family and I don't think the parties alone encouraged my daughter to do it. She had been writing herself long before any of that occurred.

&amp;#x200B;

Now, if we go to family lunch or dinner or any events, my sister gives my daughter the cold shoulder. Or warns her about being tricked into thinking she's talented. She will tell her that agents might say they like her work, but that they can change her mind about her in a moment's notice. At this point, her first book is locked in with a contract, so the publishing company is going to go through with publishing and releasing it. My daughter says she knows she may never publish a book again, but is proud the first one slipped through. Luckily my sister hasn't mentioned anything to her about wanting a percentage of her earnings, she only talks to me about it and I shut her down immediately, but she demands she earned it for making my daughter somewhat of a protege. My daughter didn't even send a single chapter to her when she was going through the writing process, so my sister had 0% to do with the creation of this novel.

&amp;#x200B;

Sorry this is so long, but what in the world can I do to talk some sense into my sister? She is absolutely obsessed with being an author.

&amp;#x200B;

\*\*TL;DR sister's writing was never accepted by publishing companies, self published instead, has lost tons of money across several books, and now demands a percentage of my daughter's earnings for ""influencing"" her to become a writer herself, which is not true in the least.\*\*"
"I (26f) want to hire the girl (23f) my boyfriend cheated on me with, years ago. He (27m) has a problem with that



My boyfriend and I have been together through college, and we had a rough patch when we'd both just graduated, were having trouble finding work, and were talking our frustrations out on each other, always arguing and stressing. It came to a head when I broke my phone, borrowed an old phone of my boyfriend's for a while that was still logged into his messaging app, and some new messages from a girl popped up. He was sexting her. I admit when I saw that, I went into the app and read through their whole conversation history. I saw nudes too, but tried to scroll by fast.

It went back just over a month, it looked like they'd met at a local bar, they had sexted since then but never met in person again because she happened to be traveling since they met. But they kept texting about stuff they'd want to do together when she was back in town. It was obvious she thought he was single from the messages, and he did nothing to explain otherwise.

I felt betrayed of course, and I confronted him over it, after backing up the messages on my own laptop so he couldn't explain them away. It was a hard decision for me but I decided to give him a second chance. We went about working stuff through, building up our relationship and he had some strict boundaries about his social life and phone privacy after that. 

I also asked him to come clean to the poor girl he was misleading, and he did. Afterwards, she tracked me down on Facebook and sent me a heartfelt apology, which I accepted but I didn't continue talking to her because it hurt a lot to have that reminder.

----

Years passed since then, our relationship has become very strong and trusting, I know my boyfriend has a lot of regret for what he did and has learned from his bad decision.

I've also landed an amazing job out of college and I have just been promoted to being the technical lead of a small engineering team. I'm partially in charge of hiring decisions, I'm part of a panel that interviews new candidates.

Yesterday, we were having a woman come in for an interview, her name sounded vaguely familiar but i didn't give it a second thought, I was preoccupied with work. But when she came in, I recognized her right away as the girl my boyfriend's had sexted.

I could tell she recognized me too, from the way she looked at me. But I kept things professional, I gave her a smile and handshake and tried to make it obvious I wasn't about to hold the past against her. And she put it all aside admirably. She gave an amazing interview. She was obviously very competent, had experience that we could really use. She was both technically competent and confident and well spoken, which is a rare combination in our rather nerdy field. And one we could really use for the customer facing parts of the role. I also privately admired how she could walk into a very awkward situation and keep her cool.

Our whole group was in agreement afterwards, we wanted to give her an offer. We'd think on it for a few days as usual but I could tell everyone was sold. I didn't hold any jealousy or ill will towards her, and even if I did, I think that would be a cruel reason to deny someone a job.

---

I told my boyfriend about my day, and he told me right away that he didn't want me working with her. He felt a lot of shame and regret about that time in his life, and wanted to leave it, and her, in the past. He also want confident I could separate her as a coworker, from her as the girl he cheated on me with, in my mind. He also felt like it would be weird because my team hangs out a lot outside of work, and he doesn't think that he'd ever be comfortable accompanying me to work outings with her there.

I said he was being ridiculous, I was over it. Plus it would be horrible to deny someone a job because of something like this.

And he stuck to his guns, he is not cool with me working with this girl.

What should I do? I really want to offer her a job, my boyfriend doesn't. 

tl;dr - I want to hire the girl my boyfriend cheated on me with. I've put it in the past, and she seems like an amazing candidate to work with. My boyfriend wants me to tell the hiring panel not to hire her. He wants to put her in the past."
"I [31F] found out my husband [33M] spent 50k without my knowledge.


Disclaimer: I am NOT looking for ""leave him"" advice. I'm looking for advice on how to work this out and move on. 

About a month ago my husband met with our therapist to discuss his problem with lying to avoid conflict. When he came home he asked if we could make an appointment together and that was today. The first 45 minutes of our session were spent discussing his issue with lying to avoid conflict, then the therapist asked if there was anything he would like to get out in the open. 

Some background: For the last two years my husband has wanted a solar system for our house. Our electric bill is very inexpensive and we have a portable generator in case of hurricanes. It won't run the entire house, but it's enough to get by. This was the last year he could get this system and get the government credits for it, so I ended up agreeing. He said it would cost around 20k, which would be financed. This would work out to about the same as our electric payment. Since he's the primary breadwinner I said it was fine. 

As the solar installation progressed I asked again how much it was and at that time he said it ended up being about 38k. I was absolutely floored by this and have spent the last couple weeks being pretty upset over it, but he swears he told me the price at some point in the past and I must have forgotten. Also, the government tax credit would cover a good chunk of it. 

Today in the therapists office, what he had to get off his chest was that it actually cost $50,000. He started to justify himself saying he was basically backed into a corner because the system had to be bigger than he thought to power the entire house in case of an outage. He tried to put it on providing for me, which is ridiculous because I was perfectly happy with what we had and never wanted it. 

I literally do not even know what to do from here. We've always had an agreement that if we spent more than a couple hundred dollars we would discuss it first. I cannot even fathom spending tens of thousands of dollars without even discussing it with him first. He does not seem to grasp that this is going to affect our credit (he was talking about refinancing our house just yesterday). He does not seem to grasp that I am absolutely devastated by that amount of money (that we DON'T HAVE - it was financed) has been spent behind my back. 

At this point, what's done is done and he has what he wants. We just have to figure out how to work past it. The therapist kept telling him that I'm allowed to be angry, but I'm not even angry, I'm hurt. I honestly think I'm going to resent that solar system for the rest of the time we live in this house. 

What can I do to move on from this without being totally resentful and letting this destroy my marriage? 

\-----

TLDR: Husband spent $50,000 when I believed he was making a $20,000 purchase and I don't know how to process this and move on from it."
"My (24m) girlfriend (22f) cannot eat food without scraping her teeth against the silverware and it's absolutely killing me.


I absolutely adore my girlfriend and think she is a wonderful person, but I absolutely cannot stand the sound teeth biting silverware. It sends shivers down my spine.

I brought it up with her and told her how it bothers me and she said she didn't even notice she was doing that. I feel bad for wanting her to change the way she eats, but the sound just destroys me. She never remembers when she eats and just goes back to biting the spoon/fork and then scraping the food off with her teeth. The most progress we've made with this is when I told her to imagine her food was ice cream (because she doesn't bite the spoon when eating ice cream).

I hate to say it, but honestly this is legitimately a deal-breaker. Food is also a huge part of my life and I want to eat with the person I love without having to cringe every time she takes a bite. I don't know what to do. I want to be able to enjoy meals without hearing that sound (and I want her to enjoy meals without having to be hyper-conscious of how she's eating). Has anyone had a similar problem and what can I do at this point?

TL;DR: My girlfriend keeps biting the silverware when she eats and I cannot stand it."
"Should I (28M) tell my good friend (26F) what she said to me when she was drunk?


I've (28M) been very good friends with M (26F) for about 2 years at this point. We met at work just under 3 years ago. I met her through work, and we have remained close even after I left that job. M and I get along very well, and we talk/text/snap pretty much every day. We frequently do stuff together, both with groups of other friends and just each other. Her and I both view each other as someone we can trust and be honest with.

So a few days ago, we went to a dinner and comedy show with some friends and had drinks during both. Afterwards M and I stayed out at bars for a few more hours, just the two of us. Since I drove my car, I wasn't drinking very much and offered to drive. M proceeded to have quite a few drinks, which didn't bother me, since we've sober cabbed for each other before. At the last bar we went to their was live music and she wanted to dance, which we did. I  could tell M was pretty drunk at this point.

M started to make comments of a sexual nature at this point. Her and I have never had a sexual relationship. She asked me how her outfit made her breasts look, and then asked if I wanted to touch them. A little bit later she told me how long it's been since she slept with anyone and asked me if I wanted to fuck. I politely declined, and she didn't bring it up on the drive home. When I reached her place, she asked me if I wanted to make out, and I again declined. She was falling down drunk at this point. Then she kept trying to lead me to her bedroom, so I gave her a hug, told her good night and left. I had no desire to betray her trust that way.

M asked me the next day if she had been a problem when she was drunk. She wanted to know if she had upset me, or our other friends, or her sister (who is her roommate). I wasn't upset with her getting drunk, and told her so. But, I didn't tell her about any of the sexual comments she had made. She said she had pretty much blacked out by the time we arrived at the final bar, and that she makes a lot of jokes when she drinks. So, I want to know if I should tell her about it? On one hand I want to be honest with her in case it would upset her if I didn't let her know, but on the other I understand that people say and do dumb things when they drink and its probably best to just forget about it.

TL/DR - My good friend got very drunk and made several sexual comments towards me. She doesn't remember making them and I don't know if I should say anything. Thank you!"
"My (28) husband (31) thinks I should ask him for permission


My (28) husband (31) and I have been married going on five years. He expects me to ask him permission when I go out. I am okay with saying, ""Hey husband, I have plans with so and so after work,"" and if he has something planned he can let me know at that time. I think it's courteous to let one another know what we're doing and where we're going. His expectation though is that I say, ""Hey husband, can I go to dinner with so and so?"" This is his expectation for literally anything I want to do. If I tell him rather than ask him, he makes jokes that he just won't let me leave the house or tells me to stop testing him. 


I try to tell him that it's not normal and I'm not happy, but this is normally the gist of how our conversations go: 
Me - Why do I need to ASK you instead of just letting you know?
Him - If it makes me feel better, why does it matter? I never say no to anything. 
Me - Because I think it's controlling. 
Him - Omg you act like you're being battered.


I know deep down what he's doing is wrong, but I don't know how to explain this to him in a way that he'll understand. It's hard for me to reconcile that it's abusive because when I start to think that, I start to think about all of the ways that he's not. He's never ever hit me, he doesn't yell during fights, I control our finances and maintain our budget because he isn't as responsible with money, he doesn't isolate me, etc. 


I really, really don't want a divorce. Our marriage was not like this in the past. I just went places and let him know and that was that. If he had something planned or wanted to spend time together, he would just communicate and most of the time I'd change my plans. I'm not really sure looking back where it began to change because it happened so slowly I guess over time. I spent most of my 20s with him and was hoping our 30s would be spent starting a family and am terrified to just throw our marriage away. I don't think this is normal, but he shuts the conversations down so I don't know how to communicate how wrong it is? Any advice would help. 

TL;DR My husband thinks I need to ask him for permission to go out and I don't know how to change this dynamic without ending our marriage."
"My(32F) husband (36M) is always sleep deprived and does not have energy to talk to me. I feel really emotionally isolated and lonely.


Throwawy for obvious reasons. We have been married for 12 years but together for 16 years and I don’t know where to go from here. Before I start there are lots of good traits in my husband too. He is a great father, he supports our family well and over the years when we have had issues, he has worked on them to change to get better. I hated the fact that he did not exercise and take care of his health but since December he’s worked out at least once a day and lost 2 dress sizes and has been eating healthy. I am older than I was before and I feel totally isolated and drained to fight through these bad phases. I should mention that we usually go through these bad phases in our marriage usually after a period of time where he stays home for extended period of time like after 2 weeks of Christmas break.

But the flip side of the coin is that I feel isolated and pretty lonely. I cannot say what and how I feel to him unless he is in his “listening mood” which is not often. I have been feeling increasing alone over the last 4 weeks. We have two young children (5 &amp;2) and we went to attend a family wedding a month ago where both sets of parents and a lot of my family members were present. It was very stressful time for me during the trip and I needed a lot of emotional support that I felt I did not receive. We had a huge fight driving back from one the pre-wedding events where I got mad that he took 6 of my cousins’ children to some kind of park and did not bring them back for 3 hours. I told him if you take other people’s kids give them itinerary (In fairness, I was pretty pissed that everyone was asking me where my husband took the kids for so long and when he will be back). He said I do what I want, don’t tell me what to do. AND WHO ASKED WHERE THE KIDS WERE, YOUR FUCKING DAD? LETS GO BACK AND I CAN TELL HIM TO FUCK OFF (he did a sharp u-turn on a very busy road) and started driving towards my parents. Knowing him he would go there and scream at my dad, he’s done it in the past. It was the kids’ families asking where the kids were. My parents 20+ of my cousins were in the house, I panicked, begged him not to do this, my kids started crying in the back seat. It got so bad that I could not take it anymore during the drive, asked him to stop and got out to get some air in the middle of no where. He left me crying on the side of the road at night. My 5 year old came out of the car begging me to come inside and that he does not want me to die. He never came back to get me. I walked for 2 miles in cold and rain because I could not even unlock my phone. I was finally able to unlock my phone and called an uber. When I got home, he was asleep with the kids. This broke my heart, that he did not even care about me if I died on the side of the road. He has said sorry since we got back multiple time (if he is in his mood to “listen” he apologizes, other times he yells at to what he can do now”). This is not the first time he left me like this in our relationship.

When we got back he constantly complained that he is burned out of the kids (I was busy during wedding planning and stuff so there were times where he took care of both the kids by himself. Whenever I went out of extended period of time, I made sure the kids’ meals were planned and ready). He yelled at me that in 5 years we’ve never had a babysitter ( we had a full time nanny for my older one until the baby came along and I started staying home, after that my parents live pretty close so most Sundays and Saturday mornings the kids go to my parents unless my husband decides “I need to spend time with them”). Anyways, so throughout the process he yelled at me because I was money conscious (I was looking for a sitter for a price that is reasonable in our area). I had one come for few days to help out but things were still tense between my husband and I. I think part of it was because I was so hurt and heart broken with his behavior when he left me in the jungle, and the fact that he could use what mattered to me (I.e. to go and yell at my dad for asking where the kids were and humiliate me in front of the whole extended family). Anyways, the first one we hired was not good with children. So he told me that this is the last weekend before I have to go back to working hard, I don’t want to deal with the kids, hire a sitter so you and I can finish game of thrones. Something that is pleasurable (GoT) became a source of stress, if I don’t do this there will be another blow up. So anyways, I had a sitter scheduled and she called in sick. Within minutes I asked another one and this one flaked. Finally I paid extra for a last minute babysitting service plus paid premium rate to the sitter and got ready to go out. I told him this sitter is reliable and we can enjoy out. Anyways, he complained THE WHOLE TIME WE WERE out about how we need to be close to the house, and go home…. Even though we have cameras in the house. The whole evening felt like a chore, and finally the sitter called that our 2 year wanted dad. He came rushing back and that was end of the night. I worked HARD to get him what he wanted (a sitter) and there was no acknowledgement other than just how I do things wrong.

He comes home most days on rotten mood, sometimes its traffic (I drove for 1.5 hours in heavy traffic leave me alone, other times it is I woke up at 4 am, slept at 11pm, I have no energy for you). I tiptop around him, give him space, tell him he works hard for our family and keep my mouth shut. I feel like it is not a fair situation for me. He is always sleep deprived and in horrible mood. He CHOOSES to go to bed at 11pm EVEN THOUGH he knows he has gym at 5 am. I am cooking and helping wrap up the kids for night, cleaning up, what else can I do? If I say anything, its I am tired leave me alone. I was so hurt the other day I cried for hours and he just left me did not even look at me. Few months ago it was because he hated his job, I thought okay fine he needs his space, he works hard both to stay healthy and to support our family.

On the days he was in good mood this week, he ate, drank some beer and whiskey and watched the game. If the neighbors come, he can talk nicely. If I talk he clenches his jaws and acts like he is in pain.

I have been sick in the last week. I don’t even feel comfortable asking for a glass of water. Few days ago it got pretty bad, I had chills, and my fever was rising, I finally asked him if he could get me an extra blanket. He did and was about to leave the room when I asked him where he was going, he was got really mad at me. He said I sat there for 2 hours while you watched your stupid tv and you are never happy. But watching tv with me did not help me at all because he does not “hear” me out. I cannot talk, I feel so hurt that I feel like I am going to blow up.

But I feel like I have no one to talk to. If I even start to talk his clenches his jaws tightens his face and looks like he is in pain. This breaks my heart and shuts me off. Something as simple as we were driving the other day to a restaurant, he TOLD me to get out of the car with the kids so that he can go park even though I suggested we park and then walk together. So whatever, I am getting out of the kids and he gets super agitated again the mad face that I am taking time and there’s a car waiting behind him. I have to take out two kids from car seat and make sure they are safe. And he’s the one that chose to stop there. He said that one thing and that he got stressed at the moment. I said but that’s every day about something or the other. At this point he yelled at me said “Don’t you dare ever yell at me” and left to go sleep downstairs. If he does happen to be in his good mood, he can talk nonstop about things that interest him, his new workout shoes, his gym, his new work blah blah blah but never has patience for me. We sleep unhappy and next morning, if he is home, he will make breakfast. If I try to talk to him about things he will say “BUT WHAT DID I DO WRONG TODAY? WHAT DID I DO WRONG SINCE I WOKE UP?” Then I shut down and walk away and do my thing. If I say anything he says this, if I stay quiet and look out do my own thing, he yells at me for being in foul mood. PLEASE PLEASE I JUST WANT IT TO STOP, I don’t know where to go and what to do. To add to this all, I have been pretty sick, fever, bad bad allergies.

Another thing that really bothers me is his view on money. He is done fairly well for himself in his career and we are fortunate enough to be able to afford the slightly nicer things in life. Some example are when were on the trip he went and used a expensive gym with personal training, he went ahead and bought 10 personal training sessions but only ended up using 5 not because he did not go, but because it was time to go home. Who does not factor in how long they will be in a new city before purchasing? Another example is, I told him oh the people who worked at the city center to register our child for school were really nice. His response was, “oh we pay them”. I REALLY REALLY did not like this and when I called him out saying you don’t pay anyone to be nice, he said it was a comment made in the passing and that I was making a big deal out of it. But I think that shows how he thinks. I want my kids to talk people for their niceness not for what they can and cannot afford. Another story, there is a kid he really likes in the neighborhood, he asked this 10 year old what he’d like for birthday. The kid said some wheel thing for $80. My husband went ahead and bought himself one and one for this kid. This kid’s parents called me and told me not to buy what their child asked for (the right thing to do I think). So anyways, I told my husband so and so’s mom called, she said don’t buy him the thing. My husband blew up on me said not to tell him what to do and that he does what he wants. I told hime “F off next time, tell the parents to call you and not to put me in the middle as the messenger”. I should mention that both pairs are just sitting unused in the garage

I should mention he is the primary breadwinner, I have been home with the kids since the last 2 years but working on getting back to work (I work part time right now but don’t make closely enough). How do I be more understanding? I don’t know if I can, to be honest and where do I go from here.

&amp;#x200B;

tl;dr:  my husband is always tired and does not have energy to hear me out. He can be really mean when angry and I feel totally isolated and lonely."
"Girlfriend insists on bringing things up at the worst times.


My girlfriend wants to bring up anything any time. Example: this morning at 4:50am as I'm waking up for a 12 hour shift, my girlfriend starts asking me if I've ever had a lap dance. Or she'll bring up some non urgent serious issue right when I walk in from work. Or call me during my drive home ..  I

Then she gets mad because I'm not receptive to any of the conversation.
I've brought this up to her. I've stated the importance of timing to me.  If she wants me to be open to conversation, don't do it at those times unless it's time sensitive.  Some things can't wait.  But the majority of things can wait 30 minutes. 

Am I the asshole for not wanting to talk about things at certain times?

Right when I finish work or right when I wake up are the worst times for me. And it drives me insane.

TL; DR. - girlfriend picks terrible times to bring up conversations. It drives me crazy."
"I (25M) was supposed to get married tomorrow, but my fiancee (24F) broke up with me completely last week. It started because we lost our spark.


I'm not sure if this will get buried in new, but I've never shared my entire story with everyone and feel like I need to let it all out.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

My (now ex) fiancee and I were together for 6 years. We met when she was a freshman in college, and I was a sophomore. We lived on the same floor. Then, the next year, we moved into an apartment together and things were perfect. Sometimes you need to live with someone to really get to know them, and I realized that we were a perfect match because our living styles meshed perfectly together. Obviously, there were some ups and downs, but we were both pretty young, so we were learning and growing together. She worked her butt off and graduated from college in 3 years so we could graduate together. I went to grad school, and she went to an accelerated nursing program. This is where our problems started.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Her accelerated program absolutely kicked her butt. I was so proud of how hard she worked, and did anything I could to support her. She moved into my mom's house with me because it was closer to school, and I did everything - cooked, cleaned, grocery shopping, car maintenance, you name it. I didn't mind because I love her more than anything and would do anything to support her, especially knowing how tough her education was. But the busier she got, the less she focused on our relationship. The easiest way to sum it up is the intimacy - we went from having sex multiple times a week, to a couple times a month, to once a month, to once every few months, and now it has been a year and a half since we've had sex. I tried talking to her about things and our lack of intimacy, but the conversations didn't lead anywhere. I didn't want to feel like a creep continuing to ask, plus I felt really defeated for asking and being constantly shut down.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

She graduated and we immediately moved into our own apartment together now that we were both working full time. ""Great, she's done nursing school, we can focus on our relationship now and get the intimacy back,"" I thought. Well I was wrong. She started focusing on work, and her new work friends, and started pushing me away. I recognized the problems, but didn't say anything because I was really happy for her - she made new friends, she LOVED her job (which she thought she would hate), and she was growing as a person. I wanted to let her grow and live her life. I recognize now that was a mistake but not recognize things sooner and addressing them.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

So about 3 months ago, we finally acknowledged that we had a problem, went to counseling, and decided to postpone the wedding so we could work on our relationship. Then, there was still an awkwardness so I decided to move out for a month so we could take some time to ourselves and re-evaluate our relationship. Finally, as the title says, we were supposed to get married tomorrow, but she decided it was best that we completely break up a week before the wedding was supposed to be.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

This ended up being longer than I intended, but I haven't shared this entire story with anyone. If you made it this far, thanks for reading my story - I just needed a place to let it all out. I know it's over between us, but where can I go from here? Do I just take some time and focus on myself, and spend more time with friends and family? 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

tl;dr: I was supposed to get married tomorrow but my fiancee broke up with me last week. We lost our spark and haven't had sex in a year and a half"
"Me [25F] with my manager [55M]. He is quickly overstepping professionalism


I am looking at moving on from my job and have asked my manager to be my referee. I have always gotten on quite well with my manager and would consider him as a good acquaintance. My manager is a powerful and well-known man in my industry. 


My manager and I have gone out for coffee during our lunch breaks at work. I have seen him do this with other colleagues (male and
female), and I commonly have a coffee with others too. The point of these meetings was to discuss my options/future and reference details without being overheard at work. We also exchanged numbers so we could communicate about my job applications.


Everything was above board for months. We rarely contacted each other and every bit of contact was about work.



He recently confided in me that his marriage is on the rocks. This seemed more like him just needing someone to speak to. I listened to him as a friend/decent human being. 


But things have now changed. He texts me constantly, has bought me chocolates, and asks me to hang out on days off. He says that he misses my company and offers to do big favours. He says that he wishes he was younger to have “a second chance” and said that he knew from the moment that he met me that I was “special”. He described the initial phase of meeting me as “falling”. He has tried holding my hand too. 


I’ve started distancing myself. I keep interaction to the absolute minimum at work. Ive made it clear that I’m not interested (and don’t respond to texts at all at times) and that he is a married man. The problem is that I feel that if I slight him by asking him to back off then he could potentially ruin my career. I have started sourcing others references and seemed to have secured 2 good references but I still feel that I have to be extremely careful not slight him for fear of burning bridges. It feels like I am walking on eggshells trying to ensure that I don’t rebuff him in a way that causes him to be insulted/angered. 


How to I handle this without burning my career? 


TL:DR - Married manager is my reference/has a lot of power in my industry. He seems interested in me. Feel that I have to tread very carefully while turning him down. Worried that he could ruin my career if I rebuff his advances."
"[Update] How can I [30/F] be less intimidating? There is a guy [28/29/M] I like and don’t want to scare him off


 

Here is a link to the [Old Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/bvbnar/how_can_i_30f_be_less_intimidating_there_is_a_guy/). I got a lot of great comments!

I basically wanted to thank everyone who wrote in and gave me such great advice. Most people gave me some dating pointers but the message was to try and not change who you are (who I am). That advice couldn't have been more spot on.

Friday was a b-day celebration for a friend. My friend was bringing her brother who is newly re-arrived to the area and I confirmed he was single. I want to put it out there and say that [/u/thebramb](https://www.reddit.com/u/thebramb/) was 100% spot on. I thought I knew it all about dating but had a lot to learn. I feel like in some ways I'm still a teenager in that regard. For example, we were chatting as a group and people were joking around and I was getting lightly teased and figured that meant that there was a ""no thanks, don't advance"" sign between the New Guy and me. I made a comment to a friend who pointed out that it generally means the opposite. I don't really know what any of the signs/signals are; I don't know when to go in for a kiss or when to back off, and I'm not entirely sure who/how one asks for a date. Anyway, things went swimmingly on Friday so it's not a huge issue.

After the dinner we hung around for drinks and he specifically got me to sit next to him. It was absolutely magical. I had such an amazing time. We wound-up chatting until really late in the night. Instead of being intimidated, I find him intimidating more than anything. He's very smart, very well educated, very classy and very well mannered. We share similar interests but it was also so nice to meet a guy who had his own interests and passions and who is as committed to things like learning as I am. He's so charming and funny that I found myself laughing even at things that normally wouldn't tickle my fancy. He made plans with his sister &amp; her family for the following day and then invited me to join them. His sister gently told me to seriously find a way out of work and come as he is very interested in me. I furiously texted colleagues to see if they'd switch (such a shitty move, but I really wanted to go). Fortunately someone really wanted the shift, so I was free.

We spent the late morning &amp; early afternoon with his sister and her family and then they went home to nap the kids, so New Guy and I went off. We wound-up spending the rest of the day together walking around and snacking and having fun. We grabbed an early-ish dinner (I was so tired as I'm not used to being up late for social activities). I was planning what I should do to ask him out/let him know I was interested but he just asked me out and we're going on an actual date this Friday. We've been chatting via text and he's still gently teasing me. I committed a faux pas and asked if we should split the bill and he responded with a joke and said it was his treat and not to worry. He's using that as fodder for his jokes.

I really see now how not dating left me a little out of ""synch"" with the rest of the people my age. It also showed me that I don't need to change to be noticed or meet someone. It's the first time I've felt ""good"" about dating and not trying to find a way to ensure the negatives outweigh the positives. He's very easy to talk to and from what I know and others have told me, he's a very, very easy going person, which is good because I can get stressed-out and uptight a little too easily. All-in-all I feel really good.

tl;dr Took the advice presented here and had a great time &amp; 'date' Have a 2nd date coming up and really excited about where this could go and enjoying having a new friend. Very happy that my first thoughts were wrong and am moving in a better direction. Updating to thank everyone who commented."
"I (24M) don't want to hang out with my girlfriend's (22F) parents. I've met them multiple times and had 3 dinners with them, we've been dating 5 months, and they seem overbearing to me.


Her father called me in for a sit-down talk at their house last week because I had been ""criticizing his parenting"" according to my GF. I had essentially been listening to her vent and taking her side and I explained this. He was calm throughout but I still felt intimidated and like he was infringing on my and his daughter's privacy. 

Now they're inviting me over for dinner (I've already been for 3 dinners) and I don't want to go. My GF blew up on me last night about it. I come from a family that doesn't want to meet SOs until the relationship is very serious. I know that's extreme but I really like how much independence my parents have given my siblings and me and I think it's more natural. 

Constantly hanging out with another person's parents strikes me as strange and unpleasant (although I love spending time with my own parents). And full disclosure: I strongly dislike her parents.

**TL;DR My girlfriend wants me to spend more time with her parents, and I don't.**"
"My (25M) girlfriend (23F) takes her frustration out on me when I get hit on


 So a little context, I model for a living. It’s something I’ve really enjoyed doing these last few years and it made me feel good. The last two years though, I’ve been with this girl who constantly makes me feel terrible about myself.

For example we went out to eat with her family last night and the waitress was flirting with me. I felt sick to my stomach knowing the awful night of tension that would ensue afterwards. Maybe I'm being insensitive because I don't really get jealous but it still sucks.

This type of thing happens pretty regularly and I can feel the self-loathing start to build in myself. I know this stems from insecurity because every guys she’s been with before has cheated on her but I don’t like where this path is headed. I tried to breakup with her a few days ago and she guilt-tripped me saying she wouldn’t be able to finish school because she’d be so depressed. I’ve been trying to make friends as my lifestyle is fairly isolating and I’m eager to break out of it but anytime I do the guilt comes rolling in.

Any help would be very appreciated, thank you.

&amp;#x200B;

tl;dr my girlfriend makes me feel awful when I get hit on and I don't know how to approach this"
"Girlfriend (29F) broke up with me (32M) by text. How do I even respond?


Girlfriend of a year and a half just texted me to say that she can't be my girlfriend ""this summer"" because she has to do some ""soul searching"". I'm pretty sure this is code for ""banging some other dudes"". Anyway, how do I even respond to this?  I'm pretty sure it's over between us, but I've got no real animosity towards her even though this is a shitty way to break up.  Is it even worth trying to get some answers from her regarding her motivations?  

TL;DR How do I respond to my girlfriend's breakup text?"
"(Update) I (24M) feel burnt out holding up my SO(22F) of 2 years, but I can't figure out my course of action.


Original post here: https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/bvix8d/

Hey all I've returned, to say as most do, I never expected the amount of comments and people who reached out to me in my time of need. Thank you all so much for your kind words and blunt insight. 

After I read your replies, it helped me realize that I needed to address this issue with a sit down conversation, I gave my SO space and mulled over my next move for the weekend and knew what needed to happen. I knew I needed to be out of the relationship. I love my SO very much, but I felt that even if she had changed her mind about therapy and getting more involved treatment for her other chronic issues, that I would've continued to sweep mine under the rug in order to better support her. 
She came over to the house and we talked sincerely about how I was feeling and she was very understanding, my guilt was and is immense. The situation is shitty, but I needed to breathe again. She had told me some night months ago that the only person that did the breaking up with her in the past was over her conditions, and that pinged in my head the day of our talk. I explained to her that I couldn't be her only outlet of support, I'm not a professional carer and I was hurting myself by trying to be, and that she needed to seriously seek therapy or a support group to work on her trauma and anxiety. 
She was 100% understanding of all that I said, we both agreed that I should keep the cat, and she told me she'd still like to speak and come over and visit the cat every once in a while. At some point in the future I think that'd be okay, but everything is still very raw and I'd rather not put undue stress on either of us and take some space.
We packed up her things, which all fit into about two boxes, said our goodbyes, and I spent some time with my close friends. All of them were shocked at our break up but very supportive. I intend on looking into some therapy myself after this, and have been doing alot of self care in the past two days. I feel like this weight is off my shoulders, the guilt has been coming on strong, but I know I will deal with that in time. Thank you all so much.

Tl;dr: I broke things off with SO, it went as well as it could, she moved out and I'm feeling better."
"Husband (34M) thinks I’m (29F) OCD because I want him to take shoes off and wash his hands (after bathroom) in our home?


We’ve been together for 5 years. I’m 3 months pregnant and granted this could be hormones making me extra upset lately. 

So I’m Taiwanese and my husband is American. We met when we were both in the same grad program (in SF) so while I’m still culturally very Taiwanese I’ve picked up a lot of American customs as well (I also went to an intl high school so was always somewhat familiar even in Taiwan). 

We live together and one thing that’s always bothered me about him is how 1) he never takes off his shoes in the house unless I yank them off him, 2) he NEVER washes his hands after going to the bathroom in our home and 3) when he showers he doesn’t actually wash his body parts with soap, he just lets water run over everything. 

In prior years he would argue that it’s American habits to do the things above, that 99.9% of Americans do what he does and find it normal. He says no one does this when they’re in their own house. Sure, but it’s still insanely gross even if it is a “cultural habit.” I’ve never fought him directly on it but it gets on my nerves. 

Now that I’m pregnant something has snapped in my head. I REFUSE to let him get away with this sort of stuff now and he keeps saying my “OCD is in full blast.” He’s had his sister come over to talk to me about how enabling my neat freak OCD is wrong and how I should just let my husband do what he wants in his own home. They tell me that in America no one does what I expect and everyone’s perfectly healthy so my “germaphobia” is purely in my head. I’ve talked to coworkers and they too thinks my husband is 100% justified and I’m the germaphobe. 

Idk...am I really an ocd germaphobe for wanting these things? I guess I’m not as accepting of American customs as I thought and if this really is an American thing I suppose I could be more lenient? 

**TLDR** husband doesn’t like taking his shoes off, washing hands after bathroom while in our home. He says this is what most Americans do and I should be more accepting since we live in the US. Should I be more lenient and accepting?"
"My (25f) fiancé (23m) wants to move his mother and brother into our house


We bought a house with my mother in October. It is currently in mine and my mother’s name. She is retiring to another state in 2 years, and when the time comes, the house will be signed over to me. My fiancé also has an almost 3 year old daughter who lives with us full time (bio mom hasn’t been in the picture since baby was little). 

My fiancé’s mom and his brother (14) don’t have a good situation in their house. They are in a bad spot financially and always have been, unfortunately. She works at a donut shop making 5 dollars an hour and has worked there for 15 years. The house has structural problems, mice, ants, at one point had bed bugs, is dirty (and I don’t mean cluttered or messy). When my fiancé’s mom started having a hard time with the house, my mother and I suggested they move in with us. 

We originally had this conversation around December. My fiancé’s brother is on the autism spectrum and diagnosed with severe bipolar disorder. He takes medication, but no one has ever felt it was the right fit for him. From December until now, his behavior has gotten significantly worse. 

He has physically attacked his mom when he can’t watch YouTube or has to go to school or take his pills, he pokes at the baby and makes scary sounds at her when she tries to sleep, he steals everything from food to neighbors cell phones. When he doesn’t get his way, he will bash his head off walls and punch himself in the face. Recently, he broke his hand falling off his scooter. He didn’t want to do his work in school, so he punched a hole in the wall with his hard cast and then punched a staff member with it. In December, he had behaviors, but it has gotten much worse now. I think it’s worth mentioning that he is not severely autistic. 

My fiancé still wants them to move in, but I am scared and worried. His mom is very burned out with her son, and doesn’t really intervene in anything. He stayed overnight here for 3 days, and stole food that didn’t belong to him, went to our neighbors house uninvited 15 times in one day, is using the bathroom with the door open, and antagonized the baby at bedtime. When my sister was here and told him to please stop, it’s her bedtime, he ignored her 3 times and when she walked away from him, he laughed and said “I don’t know what you’re so mad about”. 

At 8, he cut a kittens head off with hedge clippers. At 10, he stabbed his grandmother with a pen while she was sleeping until it was sticking out of her back. 

I am frustrated with him, and scared of what he may be capable of. He’s been thrown out of many schools for violence. I love my fiancé’s mother, and she needs somewhere cleaner to go, but I don’t want to feel unsafe or angered daily in my new house. My fiancé seems to think I’m not giving his family a chance to adapt. 

I really need advice on how to deal with this situation and would be grateful for it. Thank you. 

Tl;dr: we planned to have my fiancé’s mom and brother move into our house, but his brother has violent and antagonistic tendencies and i don’t know if I can cope with it."
"My(28f) husband’s(31m) pants...


My husband is a beautiful man. There is no other way to put that... he is beautiful. The man works hard outside all day six days a week and has the “working man” muscles... but I feed him well and it shows around the top of his pants. A “muffin top”. 

I recently bought him some new shorts in size 36 when he is used to wearing a size 32. About a year ago I convinced him to start buying 34 and now I’ve gone up a size again. So he’s been calling them his fat pants. 

Now, he hasn’t changed a bit since I met him. He is not gaining weight or getting any bigger.... but his pants were too small when I met him. My question for you guys is this: do I tell him he’s not getting bigger but his pants have always been to small for him? Do I leave him thinking he’s getting fatter? 

TL;DR: do I tell my husband his pants have always been to small for him or leave him believing that he’s getting fatter?"
"My (28f) mom (53f) is wanting to move in with me and my fiance until she can find another place to live.


My mom text me yesterday and asked me if I could move in until she could get her SSI and find a place to live. I'm 28 and live with my fiance. A little backstory is probably needed, my mom is very manipulative and guilt trips me when I don't do what she wants or asks me to. I am also currently in therapy to help me deal with her. I honestly don't think that I could deal with her every day. Cause it can take up to 3 years to get her SSI plus I know she will take her time trying to find a place. 

My fiance and I really don't need any added stress. We both have health issues, he's disabled and would be around her way more than I would have to and she's like the biggest pessimist I've ever encountered. We try not to bring those bad vibes into our home. It causes stress and puts everyone in a bad mood. 

tl;dr I need some advice about trying to tell my mom she can't come live with me..."
"My (F27) husband (M28) doesn't want me to do anything I enjoy now that I'm pregnant


I (F27) am currently pregnant and since I've become pregnant I feel like my husband (M28) has become controlling. We've been married 5 years and I've always been an active person and enjoy hiking, jogging, yoga, surfing, and other outdoor activities. Since I've been pregnant he doesn't want me to hike, surf, swim, jog, or really do any of the things that I enjoy. 


It's taken us a while to get pregnant and my last pregnancy ended in a miscarriage, which was very painful for both of us, so I am trying to be sensitive to how he feels. He acted similar during my last pregnancy too though where he was worried, just not to this extent. Maybe if I hadn't miscarried early on I would've seen this side of him sooner. 


I'm eating healthy and see my doctor weekly and have stopped doing things that my doctor advised me to stop doing. He told me to stop the yoga I was doing, which I did, and we talked about hikes that were okay and hikes that I might want to avoid. It's not like I am being reckless and doing things I shouldn't be. My doctor has said there's no reason why I shouldn't swim or jog or do some of the other things I enjoy.


I feel like he is taking away my body autonomy and being controlling. It's like he expects me to sit on the couch and not move for 9 months. I know my own body and my own limitations and think that I can make decisions on my own with the guidance of my doctor. I dont know how to get through to him, but the controlling behavior is causing me so much stress. How do I make him see that this is worse for my pregnancy than participating in an activity that my doctor ok'd? I always wanted to be a stay-at-home mom for the first couple of years, but after this am starting to rethink that. When I tell him he's being controlling he gets upset and says I'm making him out to be a monster when he's just concerned and doesnt want us to experience another miscarriage. Any advice on how to address this with him would be helpful because I dont know what to do. 

Tl;dr Husband doesn't want me to do anything I used to do now that I'm pregnant, even though my doctor has ok'd many of the activities, out of concern that I will miscarry. I feel like he is being controlling and need advice on how to get through to him that the way he's acting is not normal."
"My boyfriend (28m) is convinced I'm (23f) likely to lose my job because of ""unprofessional behaviour"" and I am sure he's wrong



The whole group was laughing about it, and I admit I had been focusing on the more awkward and absurd parts of the story to make everyone laugh. It likely came off like shutting the machine down was more about pettiness than anything else, when in reality I decided I wasn't prepared to closely supervise its operation while also confronting a dude.

But, when Glenn and I were on our way home that night, he started to get mad at me for risking my job for petty reasons. I said my job wasn't at risk, and he called me naive. For thinking it was no big deal to curse at a customer, to extend a meeting for two hours 'to prove a point' and all that.

I told him that I'd heard firsthand from my boss that I did nothing wrong, and that the customer was out of line. And I also told him that cussing isn't as big a deal in my industry as it probably is in his. And that things were fine.

And he just doesn't believe me. Even now, a couple days later. He seems to have this idea that I'm in trouble at work whether I know it or not. And that I did something dumb and reckless. It came up again when I went to work later than usual on Friday. (I'd planned to come in late and stay late, which I'm allowed to do) But Glenn said something about me doing yet another thing that would look unprofessional. 

I'm fed up with this, I get he might be stressed about money because we live together and he's in grad school so money is tight. But I don't like hearing this shit when I don't think it's accurate. Any advice, Reddit?

TLDR.... My boyfriend thinks I'm at risk of loving my job for unprofessional behavior"
"I let my (27M) friend (25M) crash at my place for what was supposed to be 3 days, and it's now going on 3 months and it's ruining my marriage (25F). At what point are his problems not my responsibility?


Back in April my friend (we'll call him Frank) informed me of a job opportunity working at a big music festival. We both signed up and were selected to work the event, which would involve living on-site for 3 weeks. Because his lease was expiring during the time we were set to be gone, he arranged with his landlord to be out and he would store his belongings at my apartment until after the event. He planned to use the checks from the event on the initial costs of renting an apartment.

Long story short, the entire hiring round we were in was put on standby, ultimately cancelled from working the event the day before we were supposed to leave. So now he's just living in my 1 bedroom apartment, sleeping on the hardwood floor. He is flat broke and pays no money at all for rent. My wife and I spend over $2k/month on rent and utilities (Los Angeles). 

He's doing his best to get on his feet, he got a full time job but within 2 weeks they had closed the business (crazy bad luck, right?) and he was back to square one. 

He's a pretty good friend, not the closest, I've only known him for about 8 months. Aside from being a leech he's a pretty nice guy. I'm just not the kind of person who has the heart to kick someone out on the street when they have nowhere to go, but he has a family back in Ohio that he can go home to and he refuses. My sympathy is waning for this reason, because I don't understand why I should be responsible for this grown man when he has a family and support network elsewhere: he just wants to be here in Los Angeles for who-knows-what reason. He's not even pursuing a career as an actor/musician or anything, he just makes YouTube/Instagram videos that only get about 150 views once every 6 months or so. 

Aside from not being any help with rent, the real problem here is that My marriage is taking major damage from the loss of privacy. We live in a 1 bedroom apartment in one of the most expensive cities in the world that we bust our asses to pay for, and we can't even be intimate when the stars align and we are able to enjoy leisure time together. My wife is an angel who understands the ethical predicament I'm in, and isn't holding it against me, but it's clearly putting more stress on her than I would ever feel comfortable with. I'm not comfortable being the source of her stress at all, we've always gone out of our way to make each other's lives easier and this is really bothering me.

I know there are some details I've forgotten, if anything is unclear please ask me to clarify. We're going crazy, please help

Tl;Dr - I let a friend crash for a couple of days, and unforeseen circumstances resulted in him staying for 2+ months and it's damaging my marriage."
"My [24F] boyfriend [26M] told me ""It's really difficult not to cheat on you"" after a night out with his (all girls) university classmates. I don't know how to feel about it.


Me and my bf have been together for 1 year. We have a lovely time together. We love spending time with each other and we both put effort into the relationship. He is sweet, supportive and loving. I try my best to do the same and he is really happy of what I do for him. 

He always call me ""wife"" or he calls me ""the love of my life"".

So far it has been the best relationship I have been in.

 
Yesterday evening he had a university party. He attends a course where most of the students are girls. In fact, he was the only guy at the party that night. I was a bit worried, but I trust him so I just had a regular day. 

In the late evening, I hear someone coming to my house. I thought it was my roommate, but it was him (He has my keys). He was drunk and had a really weird face. I ask him what was wrong. And after asking him a couple of times he said ""I don't want to be rush... But It's really hard for me to not cheat on you with all these temptations"" (All the drunk girls at the party). 
He felt really guilty about that. 

I tried to stay calm but I just started crying and became anxious. And because of that he just decided to leave. Outside was stormy and I didn't want to let me him go. But he went anyway. 

I was a bit heartbroken. And cried in my bed for hours. 

Am I over reacting? What am I exactly feeling? I just feel like this relationship is crumbling and can't do anything about it.

TL;DR my boyfriend said ""it's really hard for me to not cheat on you"" after a night out where he got drunk and I don't know how to feel about it"
"Got my friend a cushy job. He's underperforming, not showing up, and I caught him in a lie about PTO. He has legit problems but they're way worse than what I thought they'd be. What do I do?


I (33, F) work for a subcontractor to a large, rather prestigious firm on a region-wide project. I was hired almost a year ago, and I've worked really hard to successfully build a great reputation for myself. It helped that last December, I referred a friend into my team who turned out to be a total star of an employee, even though he had no background for the role. Together we've built one hell of a team and everyone is always thanking me for bringing him on. 

A couple of months ago, our admin put in her notice. Since my referral #1 worked out so well, management at both the large firm and my tiny subconsulting firm came to me immediately, asking if I knew anyone else who could do the job. It's a critical role and we needed someone in their ASAP. I knew of a friend's husband who had mentioned he was looking for a new job and he had some skills with Excel, so I pinged him. Management jumped on it and within 72 hours, he had the job (making quite a bit more than he was at his previous role, I might add). He was employed, but had told me he was uncomfortable with the role he’d recently been promoted to, and also that he thought it was unfair his employer forbade him from taking a vacation he had booked months ago because he was out sick in January. I’ve had employers be stingy with PTO before so I was like oh yeah dude, I get it. He gets the job, gives a three week notice, takes his vacation and then works out the remaining two weeks before joining my company. 

I have known this guy, let's call him Sam (35, M), somewhat well - his wife and my partner have been friends for over a decade (they were neighbors in their early 20s). We moved to their area last year and I befriended the wife and to small extent, Sam. I'm fairly close with his wife now and I became close enough to Sam for him to come out to me as transgender (I had also come out to Sam and his wife about being queer, although I'm a cisgender female so I can't say I get what he goes through) - which actually made me feel a lot more comfortable around him and opened up our friendship quite a bit. I knew he also had some struggles with depression, but so have I and so have many of my friends - and I hadn't seen that impact him any differently than it had anyone else I've known, and he's in therapy and on antidepressants... but now I'm second guessing that. 

So Sam starts the job and his first day, I’m thrilled to have him, he looks dressed for the role, he’s taking notes and asking good questions. There wasn’t any training set up for this role, but the previous admin left a lot of notes and cheat sheets for him, he has a team of people willing to walk him through stuff and answer questions, and it’s one of those jobs that once you get the hang of it, the basic functions of the job stay largely the same. He seemed fine with that.

Second day, he texts me and tells me he has a migraine due to his testosterone shots, and the migraine is so bad it temporarily blinds him and this tends to be a thing that happens with the shots, but he usually gets them on weekends so it shouldn’t be a problem going forward. I say that sucks, feel better and don’t worry – his computer hadn’t been finished getting set up yet anyways. Didn’t think about it much after that. The next day, he texts that he actually has a fever and is getting sick - I agree that he should stay home because he shouldn’t come in. He ends up out sick the rest of the week and I end up taking his computer to him that Thursday night so he can at least log on and get the lay of the land on Friday. I chalk it all up to new job stress, bad timing, etc and pretty much don’t think much more of it.

Week 2 – Tuesday he texts in the morning that he’s “leaning towards 10” because he was up all night worrying about his sick cat. He ends up coming in much later. Wednesday he texts and says he’s running late because of an accident on the highway – fine, but Wednesdays we always have a team meeting at 9 am and he’s supposed to be the person who sets up the meeting, and he knows this. Thursday he texts saying there was a death in the family – it was someone he wasn’t in contact with any longer but he’s taking it hard. He says he wants to work though – I offer my condolences and give him the benefit of the doubt that this really is just all very bad timing. Our boss calls me and is just like “What the hell is going on, I can’t deal with this, he’s on week 2 and he hasn’t worked more than 1 full day in a week yet”. I text and call him and his wife panicking – and I’m telling him bro I’m really sorry you’re going through all of this, but your first impression window is closing rapidly and you need to get yourself into the office as quickly as possible. This resulted in a full-blown panic attack for *me* - I felt bad for him, I felt bad for my team, I felt bad for our management team. He did come in and work throughout the rest of the week, but god damn I felt burned out by the stress at that point.

Week 3 – Monday goes fine; Tuesday am I get another text that he had another testosterone shot on a Monday night again and he’s out with another migraine but he came out to our boss about his transition and so she is aware of exactly what’s going on. Our boss is very liberal and “gets it” but she’s still in a position to run a team and can’t have a person being out all the time. At this point, our boss pulls me into her office and tells me she wants to have a talk with him when he gets in, and other people in the office are asking me where the hell he is.

He gets in mid-afternoon, and I pull him outside and sit down and chat for a while about what’s going on with him. I told him that frankly, no manager would put up with this amount of absences, especially for a new employee, and he can’t get trained if he isn’t here. He gives me the “I know, I know” schpeel, complains about how he isn’t really getting trained anyways, and also says that he’s gonna switch to a testosterone cream instead of the shots as those don’t come with migraines. At the end of the conversation, he asks me if it’d be ok if he took two days off (A Thursday and a Friday) at the end of the month for a “weekend-long wedding celebration” in the northern part of the state. I tell him 1) After not working a full week your first month and not even having any PTO to use (we can front a few hours but that’s it), no, they aren’t going to let him do that and 2) if you need PTO in your first three months of work you should disclose this at the time of getting your offer, not two weeks before you need the time off. The conversation ends well enough -  I tell him dude, do not miss any more time, no being late, etc for at least a few weeks while you let all this blow over and work to prove yourself and build a better reputation. He agrees and says he's on it.

The next day, I work from home, but my assistant texts me that he’s pissed off that Sam was late to the meeting again and dressed in old jeans and a tshirt and looked disheveled (we work in a somewhat-dressy office – button downs, khakis, etc). My assistant was not used to dressing up either, but he’s sucked it up and has looked nice since day 1. He was pretty resentful that Sam felt like he could just wear whatever, especially after all the shit he’s been putting the rest of the team through since he’d been hired.

That weekend I start seeing posts on Facebook about how he’s fighting really bad depression.  I send a couple supportive texts and I do feel bad about his position (been there myself aplenty), but hope that he can soldier on because this job is a good opportunity and I do not want him to waste it.

Week 4 – Monday morning he’s sick again but is coming into the office. I bring him ginger tea to help. Tues and Weds are fine, we actually get to chitchat and go to lunch. Thursday he works from home and tells me he’s going to be on late because his wife is sick. The thing about working from home is, new employees aren’t allowed to do this within their first three months. Other employees are noticing that he’s working from home and are a little miffed – none of us were allowed to work from home our first three months. I continue to give the benefit of the doubt because I’d rather see him work from home than take another day off and risk getting fired, but I’m starting to get tired of this.

Week 5 – Says again he’s sick but he does show up to work. Tuesday, we are able to have chitchat again, and we go to coffee. This is the week when he wanted to take two PTO days at the end of the week. He complains about how he isn’t able to take the two days off like he wanted, like it’s super unfair or something. I don’t even respond to that and I change the subject.

The next day, I open Instagram and see that his wife is posting about prepping for an anime convention for the weekend. After my first “what the hell?!” initial reaction – Sam had told me they were going to a wedding – I give the benefit of the doubt again – maybe they are going to both the convention and a wedding? Who knows! So the rest of the day and Thursday are fine… Friday Sam was supposed to go for his initial employment drug screen and then fly out after work (we work next door to an airport). Friday rolls around and of course, Sam texts me that he’s sick (IBS this time) but he’ll be online later. Later that night I have dinner with one of the project leads who is complaining that she’s not sure he can perform the job duties - she had asked him to do a pretty basic task and he half-assed it and got a lot of it wrong when he could have asked basic questions. I had a similar issue with him the day before where I had asked him to do a task that he hadn't done before and he ""wasn't comfortable with it"" - my assistant didn't know how to do it either, but took it over and had it done in 3 hours. 

I later learn that that day, he missed his drug screen and never signed online at all. Assistant and I are pretty sure he just took an early flight out of town. I see posts on Instagram all weekend about the anime convention. There was no wedding. I texted the wife on Sunday asking about the weekend and she confirmed that no wedding was involved, just a small dinner that got canceled anyways. 

Now at Week 6 – and I’m fucking livid. I have barely spoken to him all week, and of course he was working from home again today, bailed on meetings with my team lead and another one of our team members, who are complaining he’s working from home too much (I’ve lost track of how many times he’s done so but now me and other employees are afraid we’ll have our WFH ability taken from us because this one guy is abusing it). He also tends to text me with details when he is late or absent, which is both inappropriate because I'm not in his chain of management, and stresses me out. I've told him that he needs to be talking to his boss instead but that hasn't seemed to sink in. 

Reddit, I don’t know what to do. I feel like I need to run a major intervention here. I want to handle this compassionately – I’ve dealt with health problems, I’ve dealt with depression, so I kinda know but again I’m not trans and I’ve never had anywhere near this many problems with work. My ideal outcome is that this guy gets his act together and just gets the job done, which I feel would make it automatically easier to save the friendship. I feel like he didn’t listen to me before, so now I’m wondering if I need to talk to his wife or what else I have to do to get through to him. He is unlikely to get fired for political reasons I’d rather not get into details on (the higher ups need employees from this particular subcontracted staffing firm and this was a hard role to fill; his immediate supervisor is totally checked out; etc).

I also really don't know enough about the side effects of F-&gt;M transitioning; I tried to look up how to mitigate the headaches etc but I didn't find anything about headaches from testosterone shots. I know it often comes with horrific depression and such and I want to be sensitive to all of this, but at the same time, he's putting way too much stress on the team at work and on me personally.


TL;DR – I got a friend a very cushy job, his attitude sucks and he’s under-performing/not showing up/I caught him in a lie about PTO. I know he deals with depression and has some medical issues from transitioning his gender, and I need advice on how to handle this compassionately, get him to get on board with the job he was given, not let this ruin my friendships with him and his wife."
"I (18F) want to get away from my Christian family's extreme lifestyle, but I don't want to be disowned or homeless.


 

&amp;#x200B;

I grew up in a Christian household with parents that are not only strict, but crazy strict. The ones you might make fun of. Anti-gay, pro-life before everything else, anti-liberal, pro-gun. You get the idea. 

A few years ago, my mother got upset about a local school in our area teaching sex education, and decided she was going to do something about it. She started a ministry that caught on like wildfire with our friends and neighbors, and next thing you know, this became our life. Our entire life. My father is a doctor, and makes decent money, so she was able to completely immerse herself in this culture with little to no risk, while also raising 8 children. 

Well. My mother was crazy then, but now, it’s like she has totally gone off the deep end, and it doesn’t help that she gets encouragement from thousands of social media followers. 

I’ve never been much into politics, and thanks to my fundamentalist parents haven’t been around many people that are not like me, but now that I’m practically grown, I want out. I’m tired of the hatred of literally everyone that is not like us. I’m tired of being told how I will live my life, even after I am grown and on my own. I’m tired of the pro-life rallies, anti-gay events, and our family being paraded around as some sort of perfect family when in reality, it’s anything but. My parents fight all the time (sometimes physically), but smile in front of the camera. Us kids are paraded around as an example of Christian excellence - I’ve never been to a public school, and everything I’ve learned about sex and anything non-religious, I’ve learned on my own in secret. We must dress a certain way, smile a certain way, speak a certain way when we are in public because my mom always says the world is watching us. 

My parents have no idea I feel this way, as I just go along with everything because I know they will disown me the minute I tell them the truth, but I feel like I have to tell them. I’m not even sure that I want to be or not be a Christian, but I know that there is more to the world out there than this, and I want to experience it. But I know that pretty much immediately when i tell them, I will need to find a new place to live because they will have none of it. But I don’t have any money, and any family I have will immediately turn against me. I truly don’t know anyone that is not in this fundamentalist lifestyle. No one will help me, I’m sure of that. Part of me thinks I should just live on the streets until I can support myself, but the idea of that scares me. A lot. But I know that I don’t want this life anymore. So I don’t know what to do. I do love my family, and would love to have a relationship with them, but don't think they will allow it if I don't live to their expectations. How do I bring it up? Or do I just leave when I am able? 

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR: My parents are evangelical Christians and have made our entire family's life revolve around this lifestyle. I want to explore what else the world has to offer, but don't know how without being disowned."
"My 16m mother 57f has been spamming me with a ton of ""funny"" things from twitter and Instagram and i want to figure out a way of dealing with this


Bit of context first my mother worked in international development for most of my life but when i was twelve she got a really nasty parasite in africa. She has been on permant disability since. for two years was practically bedridden and this has led to be very depressed and emotionally unstable she has attempted suicide twice and i personally have had to take her to the hospital for a nervous breakdown. My dad (her husband) also has spent a good portion of his life very depressed and has been ambiguous about his own history with suicidal tendencies. 

Now onto the meat of this when i am home she will yell at me to come to her room approximately every 15-20 minutes when she is awake to show me something that she finds funny ut deosnt matter what im doing, if im on the phone she'll tell me to call them back, if im doing homework ""its just a minute"" if i have someone over ""trust me its really funny"" and if i dont immediately come she'll start crying about how i dont love her.

She also sends me stuff ive literally had to change Instagram accounts so i can avoid the barrage i have 300+dms  from her all cat videos.
And she quizzes me on them and gets upset when i dont watch them

Tldr ive got an emotionally unstable mother who is bombarding me with a ton of content and i want to know some coping strategies"
"Boyfriend’s (33M) trust issues over seemingly insignificant mistake ruining our vacation and relationship


I really need your help guys, thanks for your perspective. On mobile so sorry about any formatting problems. 

Jared (33M) and I (28F) have been together for almost two years. We’ve always had a relationship where respect and communication are at the forefront, and can usually work our our problems diplomatically. He has some trust issues from the past that will occasionally rear their ugly heads when he feels triggered by a situation; for instance, a woman he was dating once ghosted him the morning before they were supposed to go on vacation. He and I are now on vacation in that some location, so that may be contributing to this.

A couple weeks before he left, I went to check my email on my own computer and I accidentally clicked his gmail instead (legitimately an accident, his is logged on on my computer and his name is just under mine). The very top email was a reminder about a parasailing trip coming up. Now, I should have just exited out of his email immediately. That would have been the right and respectful thing to do. But curiosity clouded my judgment in that moment, and I clicked the email. It turns out Jared had planned a surprise parasailing trip for our vacation. I was thrilled and texted my friend about it. 

Back to the trip. Jared and I went parasailing and went out to dinner and had a wonderful day. I know he was planning on proposing sometime soon so I thought that this might be the night. It wasn’t, but that’s ok, we still had a magical time. Something that might also be important is that after he hinted he’d be proposing soon, I told him I checked his sock drawer. I didn’t find anything, and probably shouldn’t have been snooping, but I did tell him and he just kind of laughed. No problem. Anyway, after we get home he asked if I’d liked the parasailing surprise, and I said that I had loved it, but I admitted to him that I had accidentally seen the email and clicked on it out of excitement. 

I had no idea what this would cause. We had been drinking that night, so emotions can go unchecked, but he immediately went nuclear. He accused me of being untrustworthy, breaching his privacy, and then escalated from there. He called me names I can’t even say here. He said I wasted his time and his money. He said he understands why my parents don’t love me and that he can’t believe I even got my doctorate degree because I’m so stupid. He called me a worthless cheating piece of garbage who was dead to him. He called me a slimy manipulative psychopath who was sneaking around behind his back because I also looked in his sock drawer. He said I meant nothing to him anymore and he could never trust me again and that this was over and he was taking the first plane home tomorrow. I was stunned. I knew that his trust issues were coming back up, but this is so far beyond a rational response that when I tried to defend myself and give him some perspective about why this doesn’t mean I’m untrustworthy, he screamed in my face and threw water on me.

At that point I packed up my things and left down the the lobby, it was 1am. I managed to get a hotel next door and just after that he called and texted me asking to come back. He met me at my hotel and said he was sorry and hoped we could work things out in the morning, and that he understands that he needs to go to therapy for his trust and anger problems, then he went back. I couldnt sleep. I was so rattled from that interaction. He’s never done anything close to something so terrible. 

I came back to his hotel in the morning expecting him to be sorry, but he wasn’t. He said I didn’t deserve all of those things he said, but he truly things that I’m a manipulative cheater because I opened that email and that I can never be trusted again. For the record, I have never come close to cheating on him, or on anyone. We both have our location services on at all times and know each other’s phone passwords. 

He’s been ignoring me the rest of the trip. When I tried to engage him all he says is that he doesn’t know if this is worth working through since I violated his trust so bad. I told him that if the roles were reversed, I wouldn’t care about this issue at all. I would be annoyed he opened the email, but I wouldn’t see it as an egregious betrayal like he is. He again said I didn’t deserve the things he said to me, but that he couldn’t help it and still is furious I could hurt him so bad. He thinks he may never get over it. 

Reddit, I’m shocked and perplexed. What I did was wrong, but he seems to think that the unforgivable offense here was giving into excitement and opening one email I shouldn’t have, not verbally abusing your girlfriend to the point she has to leave the hotel. 

How do I get through to him? How do I give him some perspective? I want to work through this if he truly goes to therapy for these issues, but he truly seems to have lost all love and trust for me over this one instance. He says it feels like I cheated on him. I’m giving him space, is there anything else I can do? My mom says to just give time but it’s been a day and a half and he still won’t speak to me. Thanks so much. 

TLDR: my boyfriend’s email was up on my computer and against my better judgment I opened an email pertaining to our upcoming vacation. When I admitted it to him, he went berserk, told me he can never trust me again and that this may not even be worth working through, and called me horrible names. He’s never done anything like this and is normally very rational and respectful. Not sure how to get through to him."
"My (25/f) boyfriend (27/m) doesn’t want me to rejoin his volleyball league because it’s “his thing”, and says he likes having his own friends.


Kind of a weird situation here, but basically my boyfriend and I met via a volleyball group on Facebook a little over two years ago. We played together every Saturday for about a few months throughout the beginning of our relationship and then I kind of lost interest; I’d picked up sand volleyball with a team from my work and was also doing yoga Saturday afternoons, so Saturday volleyball fell by the wayside. 

My bf continued playing throughout the summer and fall. He became fairly good friends with some of the people in the group and I would sometimes go out with him and meet them at a bar or for dinner. 

Now that the season is picking back up, I’ve decided that I want to give volleyball another chance. There are tons of volleyball groups that set up at several of the parks nearby, but I’m already familiar with some of the people in this group, my bf included, and so I thought I’d just start playing with them again. 

So today I asked my boyfriend if it’d be cool for me to tag along at volleyball today and he said that he thought I didn’t like volleyball anymore and that it was like his “space” and his own “thing”. I said that’s fine, it can still be his “thing”, I just wanted to play this one time. 

He said he’s glad I’m getting back into playing volleyball and that he can just go read in the park instead. This is where I started to get suspicious. I asked him why my playing meant he couldn’t play and he said “it doesn’t mean I can’t play, I just like that that friend group is all mine.” He then suggested that we join a kickball league together and left for volleyball. 

Is it just me, or does this seem like a terrible excuse? I mean, I guess it’s possible that he just wants to have his “own thing” that doesn’t involve his girlfriend, but something about his response is rubbing me the wrong way. He casually dated two different girls from the volleyball group prior to meeting me, and now I’m worried he may be trying to keep me from running into a new girl? 

I’ve never had thoughts of him being unfaithful before but I just don’t see why my playing volleyball with him one Saturday after not playing in over a year would be such a big deal that he wouldn’t play if I go?

tl;dr: my boyfriend doesn’t want me to rejoin his volleyball league because he wants to have his “own thing” to do with his own friends."
"My (22M) best friend from high school (22F) wants me to move in and be her roommate. Only thing is that she got super hot in college.


Throwaway because she knows my other username.


This girl and I have always been very good friends. Nothing more. I've never gotten that impression that there was anything else going on really. In high school, we played the same sports and were in all the same classes and always made each other laugh and helped each other with homework - you get the idea. We dated other people but we still hung out when we could. She was cute and athletic and well liked and so was I (at least I like to imagine lol). We even went to prom one year together (my school you could go any year) because neither of us could find a date. Again just as friends but it wasn't awkward or anything, really a great time.


We both moved away for college and we both went to go play D1 sports (her track, me soccer). We would still visit when we both were home or if we got a free weekend we might go see each other for a football tailgate. I even went on a Christmas break vacation for a couple of days with her and her family and a couple of other friends. What I started to notice around graduation from college was that this:

This girl is crazy hot.


Not like kinda cute, not like she's just pretty good looking, I'm talking jaw-droppingly gorgeous. 10/10 smokeshow, swimsuit model hot.


I'm not sure if she was always this hot and I just missed it, but I'm sure the sports helped. I was floored.


We got together last week after we both moved home after college before starting our lives, and we both realized we're both moving to the same major US city in August (her for grad school, me for a job) and she asked if I wanted to live together. I said yes because who wouldn't want to live with a friend who you already know will be a good roommate (place was always clean when I visited and she's very respectful of others) and save some money. 


The more I've thought about it, the more I'm not sure how I should feel though. I think this girl is so hot. So so hot. I understand that nothing will happen between us and I've made my peace with it, but is it still a good idea? Not too worried about her being a bad roommate, but if every time I see her I think about how attractive she is, is that...good for me? Is it allowed? I want to live with my friend but if I'm legit always checking her out I'm not sure if it's a good idea.


We're both single and have been for about six months fwiw.

TL;DR: my high school friend who got insanely hot in college asked me to move in with her and I said yes, but I'm not sure if I should do it or what to think."
"My [21F] best friend [22F] befriended my childhood bully [25F], doesn't understand why I won't spend time with them


Throwaway just in case.

When I was in middle and high school, my best friend and I were bullied pretty badly by an older girl we knew. She really fucked up both of our self-esteem and framed it as ""tough love"" from an older sister-like figure. By the time we hit, like, 15/16 years old we had gotten out from under her thumb, but we were picking up the pieces for a long time. To this day, hearing her name can send me into a panic attack, and I have physical scars stemming from her actions.

Recently, this girl approached my best friend and a few other girls that she'd bullied (not including me, mind you) and apologized, saying that she'd been going through a rough patch and that she had changed, and that she wanted to be friends with them. Most of them told her to fuck off, but my friend agreed, and they've become really close. It's starting to really interfere with my life.

For a bit of background, my friend and I are involved in a fairly niche hobby with a very insular community surrounding it. There are less than 50 people who actively participate in our whole state. She's started inviting our bully to community events, and I've had to skip three events this year because I knew she would be there. This girl isn't able to come often -- she lives out of town and isn't as invested as we are -- but it's becoming a problem for me. I have talked to my friend about this, but she doesn't get why I'm upset.  She thinks I'm being childish and that if she could forgive our bully, then I should be able to too. Yes, it's been years, and maybe I should be over it by now, but I'm not, and I don't know how to deal with it. I can't be in the same room as this girl, but my friend insists on dragging her to things that she knows I want to go to! Am I being unreasonable?

TL;DR Best friend befriended our childhood bully and keeps bringing her to events she knows I'll be at even though being around her gives me panic attacks"
"My husband (26M) thinks I’m worthless(24F)


He just walked out the door for a meeting without looking at me or saying goodbye. We got in a fight today about money. He has a pretty good paying job, but has incurred quite a bit of debt so most of our money goes towards bills. We’ve been married for a year this week, and for the past 6 months I haven’t had a job. I was in school full time, as well as getting my EMT certification. While doing that he told me it was okay and he could support both of us. I have since graduated both things, moved across the country for him and spent a couple months studying for NREMT exam while we temporarily lived in a tiny town in Pennsylvania for his work. He started to get upset with me for not having a job, which I understood. We relocated again for his job, to Georgia, and have been here about 3 months. Since getting here I have been searching for a job, and going to interviews but again, it’s a fairly small town with not much opportunity. Last week I cut my loses and started working for my mom, $25hr part time. It’s been 4 days since I started the job and my husband again today yelled at me for not having worked for the past 6 months. I just broke down crying and kept telling him how sorry I was and that I’m trying to be better and I don’t know what else he wants me to do. At this point I feel worthless. I just got my college degree, became a certified EMT, am working towards going to nursing school, started a new job this week, and I still feel so incredibly worthless. What am I doing wrong? 

TL;DR husband has been mad at me for not getting a job, now I have one and he’s still mad at me for not having one before."
"My sister's (20f) hatred of gay people is starting to impact our relationship. I (22f) am queer and want to fix things. Is there hope of us ever being close again?


My sister and I used to be really close. Growing up she was always the one who was kind and accepting and open to different kinds of people. Her friends were a group of misfits who really admired her and she was the one they went to for support. I respected that and she even inspired me to be more open. We argued a lot as we got older and now we aren't super close anymore.

After flunking her junior year in high school, my parents placed her in online homeschool and she lost all of those ""misfit"" friends and the only people she knew were in the church. The church wasn't bigoted and the people were really welcoming. She barely passed online homeschool and ended up going to the only university that would accept her because of her grades. It was a small Christian university that accepts everyone. And that's when everything changed.

Our family wasn't super religious until she got homeschooled. Now, because our hometown was super conservative and her school is in the middle of no where, I feel as if she thinks the only acceptable way to be Christian is to be alt-right. I'm not conservative but since I've grown up around that belief system it doesn't bother me too much but she's different. And she posts mean anti-lgbtq things on Instagram and makes fun of professors, doesn't believe in vaccinations and subscribes to a bunch of ""republican troll"" pages. She said a few flat earther things too. Our family moved to a new state but she still attended the same college until they kicked her out because she owed them money. Now she is hoping to go to go to a new school in the fall, and I just feel like things are going to get worse.

Our brother came out as bisexual a couple months ago. While our parents are looking for a house in this new state, we are living with our aunt...and her female partner. I came out as bi in high school though not to my parents yet. I'm well aware our family has an abnormal amount of queer people. I guess maybe that contributes to her isolation.

I just graduated college and am living with my parents, siblings and aunt as well while I save up for my own place. I want to use this moment to get to know her better since during my 4 years in college our relationships was rocky. But I'm uncomfortable with a lot of the things she says and don't like the stuff she posts on instagram. We don't listen to the same music or watch the same tv shows because she finds the things I like to be sinful. The only thing we can actually bond over is fashion.

I would love to have my sister be my good friend again. I wish I could be like the other people who are bffs and do everything with their siblings. At this rate, if I had kids, I wouldn't even want them to know her, I wouldn't want her to meet my friends or to even be in my wedding. Is there hope for us? I know she probably forgot about me being bi and I want to come out to my parents but I feel like things will just get worse. While I would love to change her mind about things, I don't know if that's possible. But life is short and I really would like to have a relationship with her. What should I do to help things?

TLDR: My sister has become super dedicated to her religion to the point where it is impacting our relationships. I want to be close again but I feel hopeless."
"I [31M] think my girlfriend [29F] of two years is secretly a mean and manipulative person!


Usually she’s constantly teasing everyone in every situation, this is usually not mean or sarcastic so everyone laughs along, but sometimes it takes a really, really nasty turn.


In the beginning I thought I'd won the jackpot. She’s beautiful, I know everyone says and feels that about their SO but she turns a lot of heads on the streets. She’s actually funny. She has interesting hobbies, she’s an adrenaline junkie tbh! She has an amazing job, well paying, high status, few hours. And she seems to love me more than I love her! Everyone likes her too, my buddies, my dad, even my mom who never thinks anyone is good enough for his only boy. She’s extremely extroverted, like the star of every gathering, everyone in my complex knows her a week after we start dating, people even I don’t know say hi to her in the elevator.


But then things happen, she does stuff that really bother me on a moral level.


The first time I saw her mean side is seven months into the relationship. She’s babysitting her brother’s 7 year old son, who is a bit, well, chubby. We’re watching TV and I get up to go get us something to eat from the kitchen, I ask the kid if he wants some ice cream or something and he says yes please, and she starts berating him in a very rude, mean spirited way. I don’t remember the details but these are some of the things she says to the kid in two minutes: “loser” “You don’t need ice cream you fatass, you already look disgusting” “I can’t believe we’re related”, “I you were mine I wouldn’t give you anything to eat for a whole year”, “no-one will ever like you”, “you better start liking boys because no girl will ever like you”, “you make me wanna vomit”… So I’m standing there in shock, the kid is not laughing, just looking down, and she thinks this is the funniest thing in the world for some reason. I don’t confront her in front of the kid because I don’t want to cause a bigger scene but I’m fuming mad, that night we have a big fight. She thinks I’m acting like a little girl, he has to lose weight, I’m doing it out of love, it’s none of your business, I tell her she’s a bully and she says “so what? Bullying’s good”. I leave that night really confused and angry. I was really, really mad. I kept remembering the kid’s face and I felt very sorry for him.

Next morning she calls and we meet up and she apologizes to me and calls her nephew in front of me to apologize. Says she had a bad headache yesterday and didn’t mean anything she said. We make up and move on. But I start noticing more and more things that could be categorized as mean spirited and manipulative. She’s mean to all service-persons, cashiers, doormen, servers… And not mean as in rude, but as in “fucking with their heads and ruining their days” kind of mean. Examples: we go to my friend’s restaurant and she’s super nice to our waitress, strikes a conversation about her necklace and how classy it looks and talks to her for like five minutes. Now my friend, her boss, sees this and is obviously happy that we’re having a good time, he’s a people pleaser and like nothing more than making his friends happy. At the end of the evening when we’re about to leave he comes to our table and asks how was everything, my gf thanks him and then adds “you need to be nicer to your staff, I would’ve never taken you for a mean boss in a million years”. Now during the conversation with the waitress my friend never even came up, this was out of nowhere and based on nothing. He’s obviously shaken, and asks how come but she just laughs it off and changes the topic. The next time we go to his restaurant we find out the waitress has been let go.


Another example: her assistant has kidney stones and needs to go to the hospital to take them out by surgery, she’s been begging her for time off because she’s in pain, and I’m listening to the conversation over phone, my gf starts asking personal, medical questions like “how bad is the pain”, “is there blood in your pee”, “how long will the operation take”, “how much will the operation cost”, “how did you get this in the first place”, “we’re really busy this week, you have to wait at least a couple of day”, “I need to be able to rely on you”. So after the phone ends I ask her wtf is she doing and she can easily find a temporary replacement, but she says she has a very important position and if her assistant wants to do something that matters with her life she needs her so she can ask her to wait. And I’m like, yes but why would you? She just looks at me like I’m crazy.


The worst thing she ever did however was last week. We’re coming out of a shopping mall and this really old, homeless man comes up to us and before he can even ask us for money, she looks at him and says “oh sweetie you smell awful, how long has it been since you took a shower? Do you smell that!?” the man is just shocked. He starts swearing at us “rich assholes” and suddenly my girlfriend spits on him. So I’m trying to defuse the situation and the homeless man is swearing at us both. Since this is a high end fashion mall cops show up out of nowhere in less than a minute. My girlfriend starts crying and tells the cops the homeless man spat on her and that he has exposed himself to us. The man is taken away and I don’t even know what to do I just tell the officers that he’s drunk and he didn’t do anything. In the parking lot she’s giddy and giggly and I just break down. I tell her that I can’t see her anymore and that she’s mean to everyone but me and that I can’t even understand why she just did what she did to that poor guy. At first she’s apologetic but then she turns the tables on me and starts calling me “weak” and “pathetic” and that a real man would have broke the homeless man’s neck for bothering her with his disgusting smell. So I end things right there and call a cab home.


Now I’ve been thinking about all of this for a couple of days, and she’s been calling every day leaving me messages that we can mend things and that she still loves me. Truth is I still love her too, very much so, and she has never been like this with me, ever. She’s never been anything other than kind and nice. But there are dozens of these examples of her being like this to people. I don’t know what to do. Am I over-reacting? She is the best thing that has ever happened to me, at one point I was seriously considering marrying her.


TL;DR : My girlfriend is mean to other people for no apparent reason and she thinks I'm too soft for objecting to her behavior."
"I've [M26] decided to break up with my fiancé [F26] after 8 years. Need advice on how to proceed


My fiance and I have been together for 8 years. In that time we have had intercourse only a handful of times. It's now going on a year without any sort of intercourse.

I've stayed with her because I had really bad self image issues and couldn't see anyone else accepting me or wanting to be with me.
Since then though I have put a great effort into getting my mental and physical health together and I feel like I deserve to be happy again.

But I've let this relationship go on for so long. We live together and own a lot of things together. I can afford to live on my own but our lease doesn't end until August 1st.

More than anything I'm afraid of her reaction. She is extremely emotional and has used me as an emotional crutch for our whole relationship. I'm afraid of what will happen when I pull that away.

I brought up my concerns several times but she never commits to fixing it. She always understands where I'm coming from and says she will do better, but it never happens.

So I've decided to go through with the split but I am nervous and afraid of what she will do. Any and all advice is helpful.

Tl;Dr My long term fiancé doesn't connect with me sexually and never has. I've tried to help fix this but it hasn't helped. I'm making the decision to end it."
"Do I (24F) tell my roommate (27F) that I saw her boyfriend (27M) on the dating app Hinge?


I live with four other people all in our mid to late twenties and we’re all friends. Of these four one of them is a girl named Brook and she is dating this guy Sam. They’ve been dating about 9 months and she’s mentioned wanting move in with him, but that he was weird about the idea. She seems totally in love with him. 

 I recently broke up with my boyfriend and made a hinge account. Tonight I was looking through some profiles and my roommate’s boyfriend popped up. Fully filled our profile, effort was put in for sure. I’m not sure whether or not he’s using it, I didn’t match with him/didn’t attempt, but I did take screenshots just in case. It could be an old profile, who knows, but  I don’t know that for certain. 

I’m not sure what to do with this information— do I tell her? Do I mind my own business? If I were her, I think I would want to be told, on the off chance he actually is using it. Do y’all agree? Open to other opinions/insights. 

If I do tell her, how should I do it? I don’t want to tell anyone else so she has the ability to choose how to address it. I don’t want to put her in an awkward/embarrassing position though. Of all the roommates, her and I are the least close, but I still consider us friends. Thoughts?

TL;DR: my roommate’s boyfriend’s profile popped up on a dating app, do I tell her?"
"I [30F] moved to the USA to be with my husband[32M] and I absolutely hate it here and am miserable.


Hmm, title pretty much sums it up. Alright, two years ago I met my now husband backpacking in Southeast Asia. We hit it off right away, within a few days it felt like I had known him my whole life. We each went back to our separate countries and started texting all day everyday. We had a connection like I've never had with anyone before in my life. We spent the next year travelling back and forth to one anothers countries, and when he asked me to marry me after a year, I couldn't wait to say yes. Right away, he sponsored me for a K1-Visa. Which is like the 90 day fiance show. Basically, it took about 10 months, and once we got it, I had to come here and marry him within 90 days. During that time, we visited each other a lot. I should mention that before we got engaged, I came to the US to spend six weeks here with him, as sort of a ""trial"" After that, we have to file an adjustment of status. Our lawyer said I should have a work permit within 4 months but after speaking to women who have been in similar circumstances, it can take up to a year. 

So, here is my issue. I've been here for two months and am dying on the inside. My husband is busy with work, so I am home alone. In my country, I worked in hospitality. I was paid a living wage, three weeks vacation, paid sick leave, women are entitled to one year paid maternity etc. Although tipping is not customary in my culture, because I worked in one of the top hotels in my city, we had a lot of foreigners who would tip us in the restaurant - so I did very well for myself. Unfortunately, in the USA I wont make nearly as much and his family has kind of looked down on me for being a waitress - so I am already thinking of other things to do. I am an Art History major, which in hindsight was incredibly dumb, but I have no loans at least due to education being free where I live. 

Moving to my country was not an option because his job is basically non-existent in my country and he loves his job and after years of dating I will say it's very nice to date someone who is passionate about their job. OKAY, I am rambling and all over the place.

Basically, I sit at home all day. I have no friends, I am not legal to drive. While I have savings, they aren't really enough to do much and we are using them to help pay lawyer fees, plus day to day expenses around the home. We live in the deep south, and I can't stand the ignorance and politics of people here. The urban sprawl here is ridiculous, nothing is in walking distance and you need a car to get everywhere. It's currently 38 degrees Celsius so biking places is not an option for me. The weather is extremes. Women have no paid maternity leave, I am terrified of being sick, despite healthcare insurance. I did not realize that you still have t pay thousands of dollars with insurance. 

 People here don't give a crap about the environment and can't even bother to recycle their pop cans. I am a vegan and his family are not respectful of my choices. There are no options of me to eat at restaurants. I've always considered myself a foodie - but I'll be lucky if there's even a salad at a restaurant. I have no idea when I will be able to work, I can't afford to upkeep all the things I used to enjoy (lashes, fake nails, yoga, wine membership clubs, travelling) etc. I feel incredibly isolated, and lonely. My husband, bless him. Is the love of my life and is really trying to help me, but I am wondering if this is going to be enough.

People have told me to just stick it out, and wait. I'll get my work permit and things will be good. But, I don't know how much longer I can wait. I've talked to my husband about it so he is taking us on a four day trip to California to try and make me feel better - but money is tight and we are trying to plan some sort of official wedding (we're already married, but want something for friends and family) and the prices compared to my country are ridiculous for that too. I am not sure where this post is going, but I am starting to get irritated by small things with my husband. I am cleaner than him, and while he is clean, it's exhausting having to please ask people to not wear shoes in the house all the time. I have to constantly remind him of things, otherwise it wont get done. He tells me he's forgetful and doesn't mind how often I remind him of stuff - which is true - but I feel like a nag. I just want to ask once! 

We have so much fun together, we are always laughing together and I love being with him. I could be with him all day, everyday, but I do need my own life outside of our relationship, otherwise I fear for each of our sanity. 

How do I talk to my husband about all of our issues without blowing things up? I love my husband and want this to work but I am incredibly isolated and lonely, and fairly unimpressed with US culture and politics and am just getting irritated over the smallest things for absolutely no reason.  This abortion stuff is throwing me over the edge, along with people completely ignoring climate change. I feel like I am in some weird movie. The education system here is appalling. 

tl;dr: love my husband, but am lonely and isolated in the usa, and am sick of right wing extreme politics and having to deal with them, how do I move pass this without resenting my partner?"
"I (24F) believe my guy friend (27M) thinks we’re dating


We’ve been friend for years, but I just moved back home after college so we’ve been going out for food like once every couple of weeks or so (sometimes just us, sometimes with a group) because I’ve been pretty free and he keeps asking to hang out. Every time we get food he insists on paying, and he texts me a lot with all these smiley faces wishing that I have a good day and all that stuff. He’s always kind of been like that but now he’s doing it more... it’s annoying, honestly. Yesterday he sent me these two memes about dating and captioned  one “next time we go somewhere” so I’m like oh great.....

Like no chance, zero percent attracted to him. I definitely just see him as a friend and have told him so in the past. I really don’t want to make things weird because we hang out with the same people. 

TL;DR: How should I go about taking to him about it while still maintaining the friendship?"
"It's starting to dawn on me [18f] that my dad [53] is abusive and I may have to phone the police on him and that scares me


My mother [55] came into my room to talk to me about my dad's behaviour just now; she told me that she wants me to tell her as soon as he lays a hand on me with intent to harm.

This was prompted by an incident that happened in the kitchen as I was doing the dishes and it all started with a pudding cup. To put it simply, I forgot that I already had a pudding cup after dinner 4 hours ago. This happens due to medical reasons that I sometimes have a bad memory (I can be airheaded, oblivious, and dense). I explained that I forgot, my dad claimed that I was lying and making excuses and wouldn't allow me to say that I just simply forgot and he cant and wont understand how my brain works and how I think (I'm on the autism spectrum, possibly from him).

Reddit, he went ballistic. He stood so close to me he could have leaned forward a couple of inches and his entire body would be touching me (especially pinning me to the sink) and bellowed in my ear for about a minute, right in my ear. As an autistic person, loud noises so close to me and so suddenly causes me stress and anxiety. It was a miracle I forced myself to lack a response. My mother told me that when I turned away to continue the dishes, he had backed up a  it, then turned around suddenly and stormed up behind me with his fist positioned near my head to punch me, but stopped when my mom hissed ""Don't you dare"". She had to do this twice and then physically restrain him the second time before he left. I didn't notice this.

He has done this to her many times during their relationship of 19 years. She would say something he didn't personally agree with and he would make that motion, threatening to cause physical harm, before he would stop himself and instead smack a chair or the table. Or scream, yell, bellow, or shout.

His anger is horrendous. If he doesn't get his way, he throws a temper tantrum and sulks. Only he can make jokes about you, no matter if you don't find it funny however you cant make a joke about him otherwise he will get pissed. He can't laugh at himself.
If I'm having a conversation with my mom about something that doesn't concern him, if he overhears something he doesn't like, he will barge in and force himself into the conversation. A good example is a post I made on r/childfree that I will link if someone asks.

He has to be in control. Early on in my parents' relationship, he would trynd persuade my mom to stay with him.instead of see her friends or family. My mom isn't as much if a pushover as I am and she didn't back down. I'm proud of her for that. In addition to this, he will try and persuade her from buying something she wants (like a teapot or a mug, really stupidly small things) and tell her it's not needed however he will splurge on a 4K television and an Xbox One X that he didn't need (as he already had a good TV and an Xbox One) and tell mom to shut up if she complains about it.
However saying that, he has always been lenient with me growing up, whereas my mom was the one who can't cut the apron strings. But now and again he will try to dominate either one or both of us. Mom can break it just fine, but I can't otherwise he will get angry.
One example of him getting angry with me in regards to domination and control is tickling. Ever since I was little, he tickled me, even though I hate it.Ive explained to him and my mother that it makes me feel threatened and I am blamed if I wet myself when he tickles me, even if I war him that I will. He will try and corner me or pin me to something and tickle me until I cant breathe and I went myself. His excuse is ""Your laughing so you obviously like it!""
But I don't! I hate it, Reddit. Especially being autistic, I have sensory issues and touching me when I'm unaware of it or don't want to be caused an immense amount of stress on me. Adding onto the feeling of being attacked, with no escape, and often to the point I completely soak my underwear and trousers wITH PISS AT AGE 18 LIKE A GODDAMN TODDLER WHEN I SHOULD HAVE BETTER BLADDER CONTROL is ridiculous. It's worse when he disregards my feelings and blames me soiling myself on me. I told my mother what he did and she told me that when she spoke about it to.him, he told her ""So I can't touch my own daughter when I want too? She's my daughter, I can touch her when I want."" and got really pouty and sulked.

He also has to be right all the time. An example of this was the pudding cup incident tonight and that's the best one I can remember at the moment. He thinks he knows me ""because I have lived with you for 18 years and am your father"" when in fact he doesn't. He doesn't know what goes through my head, he doesn't know what my thought pattern or train of thought is like, and he doesn't know how my brain works. Not fully. I tried to sound as calm as possible when I said this to him. I think he saw nothing but red.
I think I should elaborate on this. He gives me the impression that if he ignores the fact that I am autistic (as well as other mental health issues but I wont go too.in detail at the moment) then I am not, and I'm just making excuses.
Excuse. That's his favourite word with me when we have an argument. What I believe are rational, justifiable reasons to things, he regards them as excuses. Is this to make himself feel good? Is this a power thing? I don't know, but what I do know is that its infuriating to be belittled like this while knowing I can't do shit about it otherwise I risk a slap so hard my jaw might dislocate or worse.
When I was a baby, I suffered with a bad case of colic and while I am not blaming what my dad did entirely on him since he was sleep deprived, he went into my room, picked me up, and smacked me hard on the thigh when I was 2 months old, then refused to give me to my mother and it was only when his mother got involved that he relented. My mother almost kicked him out that night. She told me she's thought about doing it many times throughout the years.

But what makes me feel guilty is thinking what I am thinking now. Other than what I have spoken about above, he is good. We can joke together, have a laugh, have deep conversations, he gives amazing life advice, he buys me what I want if we can afford it, he makes me food and coffee prompted and when mom is out of town we can snack on whatever we desire, and he's otherwise spoiled me. That's the main reason for my guilt, because he's done so much for me that to label his as a possible candidate as an abusive person makes me feel rotten.

Reddit, what I'm really trying to ask is what would happen if I was to make the phone call. My mother told me, after having to sneak upstairs and talk really quietly so he wouldn't hear us, is to tell her if he smacks me or threatens me with intent to harm, and it's likely that police would be involved for a case of domestic abuse. 
What would happen if that call was to be made? How would my mother and I be able to deal with that? Without him we would probably be even more poor than what we already are and maybe in some sort of assisted housing (we live off benefits, dad is unemployed, and my mother is disabled).

TL;DR&gt; it's possible that I might have to call the police on my own dad if he hits me one more time, and it has taken me 18 years to realise that he is sometimes abusive to me and my mother. Admitting it is making me feel rotten. If any other memories or other reasons to update come to mind that don't need a whole new post to themselves, I'll add it here."
"My GF (25F) refuses to eat leftovers and doesn’t cook. It drives me (27M) absolutely nuts.


So my GF recently moved in and as the title states, refuses to eat leftovers and doesn’t cook. This leads to her eating out or eating everything that is prepackaged (yogurt, string cheese, goldfish, etc.). This drives me crazy because 1. It is a waste of money 2. Is unhealthy (she is in good shape but time will catch up with her) and 3. Slightly disrespectful as I’m always left eating what I cook for 3-4 days straight and she won’t touch it.

What has recently pushed me to the edge is that she’s enrolled in a meal prep service that is $9 a meal, frozen, and absolutely tasteless and she fails to see that she’s just buying crappy frozen leftovers at $9 a piece. My concern is in the long run having a family with a bad standard being set by my children’s mother and throwing thousands of dollars away on eating out and wasting perfectly good food. 

FYI- I have offered to meal prep for her but she’s too stubborn to say yes

TL;DR: Girlfriend won’t eat leftovers, doesn’t cook and wastes money on eating out."
"My wife {f40} and I {M43} had a huge fight because I don't choose or plan things to do


This is my first post ever on reddit. Forgive if I make mistakes. 

My wife and I have been together for 24 years, we have our ups and downs. 2 kids 24 and 14. 

My question here is she gets really REALLY angry when I don't have an opinion on where or what we eat, or what we watch on TV, where we go on vacation etc.  If they are having fun I am good. Why is it such a big deal that I don't care. Last night we were going to eat and she asked where I would like to go and I said ""IDK where would you like to go?""

She basically went ballistic and well we ended up not going anywhere and just arguing for a couple of hours. 

I don't understand. 

 TL;DR: Don't understand why wife gets mad I don't care what we do"
"I [26F] am finding it hard to continue supporting my husband [29M] in his music career


 

My husband and I have been married several years. I finished college, he didn't (and didn't really need to due to his audio experience). We moved to a big city and he immediately got a job in audio. It didn't pay the best, but combined with my salary, we were living comfortably.

Eventually, we decided to move to a cheaper area so he could transition to doing music full-time (as he'd found he enjoyed music more than audio engineering).

We've been in the cheaper area for about six months now. He does gets songs released through labels and travels to DJ different gigs (about 2 per month), but he barely makes any money off of this. Luckily, he still does a bit of audio work on the side for his music friends, so that's the main way he makes money.

My main concern for a long time has just been him cancelling out his own expenses (because he spends a LOT on music gear). So far he's been good about this, but last month we ended up $7K in the red, which he will probably earn back, but... I'm very stressed. Lol.

I'm just so tired of it. I got a higher-paying job and we're still in a worse situation than when we lived in the city due to him doing music. It's like I'm working harder and harder yet my quality of living just keeps getting worse. He's living his dream, but there's no money for me to have any hobbies or do basically anything. I've spent most of my 20s just sitting at home doing nothing so that I can afford to support us while he does music. And he's so busy with music that we barely spend time together... but I can't ask him to not work as much because the more he works, the faster he'll get to the point of making real money, and we need that.

He's making amazing progress and I don't want him to stop because I fear that if he gets an audio job, he'll be unhappy the rest of his life. And the best time for him to take this risk is now, before we have kids.

I should also add that I've been looking for a second job for a long time now, but nothing has come through. And it feels unfair for me to work my ass off while he lives his dream. Maybe that's selfish of me, but that's how I feel.

How do I get over this resentment/actually start living my life through all this?

tl;dr My husband is living his dream with a music career but I feel like there's nothing leftover for me."
"I (30F) moved across the country with my husband (30M). Six months later, my parents (60's M/F) are looking at moving here too. I don't know if I can handle it.


My husband and I moved from the west coast of Canada to the east coast last January. We're doing awesome, and we love our lives here.

My parents recently sold their condo, and have flown out to visit this week. They've spent most of the visit looking at houses, and seem pretty set to move.

I thought I was okay with this, but after spending some time with them I'm remembering why I do better when our relationship is less close. They were pretty absent parents when I was young, and they drink more than I'm comfortable with (this is additionally stressful because I am two years sober this week). They are also not great at dealing with their emotions (they get really mad and worked up about little things, and they dwell on them for way too long). It causes me a lot of stress when I have to be around then when they are like this.

The problem is, I feel like the ship has sailed in terms of telling them I'd rather they didn't move here. And I don't feel like they'd be open to talking about why I find the relationship stressful. I'd like to think if they move out here I can continue to keep some distance, but my husband and I will be the only people they know in this province.

Advice on how to navigate this would be appreciated.

For additional context, I am not an only child. I have an older sister who they'd be moving away from, and she has two kids (their only grandchildren). My husband and I are childfree and they know this.

tldr: I moved across the country and six months later my parents are following suit and I don't think it will be good for me."
"The guy [38m] that I [28f] have been seeing blocked another guy's number on my phone


I have been hooking up with a guy for four months now. I finally asked him if he wanted to be boyfriend/girlfriend on Wednesday. He said he had to think about it because he works a lot and owns a company. That wasn't really the answer I was looking for, so I got back on the dating apps. 

After that, I went on a date with a guy named Robert Thursday that went well. We made plans to see each other Saturday night. On Friday, I got coffee with the guy I was hooking up with casually. I noticed Robert didn't text me all day on Friday, which I found odd but maybe he was busy at work. 

Then this morning I got a call from a blocked number. I picked up and it was Robert. He said his texts and calls weren't going through to my phone. 

As it turns out, Friday, when I went to the bathroom I received a text from Robert. I don't have a passcode on my phone so the guy I'm hooking up with saw it and blocked Robert's number!!! I apologized profusely to Robert and we are still on for our date tonight. 

Now I'm not sure what to do because I care about the guy I have been hooking up with and told him we could still be friends. Do I confront him that I know he blocked Robert's number? Do I ignore it? 

&amp;#x200B;

**TL; DR A guy who said he doesn't want to be my boyfriend blocked another guy's number on my phone without my permission. I'm not sure what to say or do about it at this point.**"
"My (29M) family just met my GF's (26F) family for the first time and are uncomfortable with the gifts that they were given.


Throwaway account because I have family and friends on Reddit-

I (28M) have been dating my GF (25F) for a bit over a year now, and we decided  to visit my home city so that she could finally get to meet my family and friends. She comes from a different, more conservative country, and her family is very wealthy owning several large businesses and is involved in their country's government. Her parents decided that they would like to fly out because they wanted to meet my family as well.  I got along well with her family the one time we met, and I know that they just want their daughter to be happy, so I didn't object despite this unexpected change in plans. My GF assured me they didn't expect any marriage negotiations and simply wanted to meet my family. I told parents about this and that they would probably bring gifts since it is part of their culture. My parents agreed to meet and decided to make reservations for all of us at a nice restaurant. 

We picked her parents up at the airport and the next day we went out to a lovely dinner with both our families where we all seemed to get along quite well.  My family paid the bill, and we took them back to the hotel. There they proceeded to lavish my parents, my sister, and I with gold and silver jewelry, expensive bottles of alcohol, exotic clothing, and several precious gemstones. My family was completely shocked; I had no idea that they would be giving us thousands of dollars worth of gifts. We awkwardly said goodnight and went home shortly after the gift ceremony (for lack of a better term).

Since that night each person in my family has privately expressed their discomfort with the value of these gifts, and my mom keeps asking me what we can get them in return. My family is in good shape financially, but no where near my GFs family's level of wealth. I have stated multiple times that we can't try to go gift for gift with them but my family still feels uncomfortable about the situation. They feel that this current dynamic makes them seem indebted to or inadequate next to my GF's parents. Tonight my mom straight up asked me why couldn't I date someone who was more in our class. I have also been asked by family members not to tell my GF about their feelings since that will ""only make things more awkward"". 

To complicate matters more, I politely explained my family's shock about these gifts to my GF, and she laughed it off saying that the looks on our faces were priceless and that neither she nor her parents are expecting anything in return. They just like to give gifts. I know that she is saving one more fancy gift that she had specially made for my mom and plans to give it to her before we leave.  I can't tell my GF not to give it to my mother since it was made just for her, but I don't know how she will respond when given another valuable item on top of all that has already happened. 

Does anyone have any advice on how to best manage the situation? I don't want to seem ungrateful to her family, but I don't like seeing my family so uncomfortable. Should I be focusing on trying to change my parent's outlook on the situation, trying to politely dissuade any future gift giving, or a bit of both? Is there any alternative solutions out there that I am not seeing?

Thanks for any help you can provide!!!

TLDR: My GF's family gave my family thousands of dollars worth of gifts upon meeting and now my family feels inadequate."
"I[f23] think my co-worker[m40~] is secretly videotaping me


One of the supervisors at my job, let’s just call him Brad, comes over by my desk at the end of nearly every day to talk to the co-worker (let’s call him Charlie) who sits in front of me. As a recent new hire, I always thought Brad was being friendly and wanted me to feel welcomed, but in the last couple weeks I’ve began to feel growingly uncomfortable. 

It started with comments on my new haircut, to comments about my clothes, and my appearance in general. It seems to me that he has recently been making an effort to pass by my desk, because he works in a completely different area of our office and to go by me it literally is out of the way.. and I see him at least 10-15 times a day. 

I have noticed in the last couple of weeks that when Brad leans up on the desk next to mine to converse with Charlie that he has his phone up with the camera pointed at me while he’s talking. I thought at first I was being paranoid, but it’s continues to happen. I did an experiment and moved when he was holding his phone up to see if it moved with me, and it did. It has started happening at different times of the day now too. For example, I got up to print something and I noticed that Brad got up and had to tell a story to someone near the printer. I looked over and his phone camera was pointed at me while he was holding his phone at his side... and it moved again when I walked away. 

I am not sure how to handle this, as I don’t have proof of it happening. Am I over thinking it? 


TLDR:
I think my coworker, who is a supervisor for a different team, is secretly videotaping me at my desk/when I’m doing other tasks. What do I do?"
"About to leave my [28/f] husband because he [31/m] keeps yelling in a language I don't understand when arguing


My husband and I have been married for two years now. When we argue and he gets really upset he'll start arguing in his mother tongue and I'm sick of it.

I've been trying to teach myself his language but it's one of the hardest languages for English speakers to learn so it's taking me some time. My husband is fluent in English and went to prestigious American boarding schools so he can argue in English if he wants.


The reason I have such a problem with this we had an argument shortly after we got married and he called me a whore in his language. I had just learned that word from a tv show I had been watching so I knew immediately what it meant.

I asked him how exactly am I whore and he said he was shocked I knew that word and apologized. My thing is that I don't know what he's saying in his mother tongue about me so I have told him again and again that when we fight, that I don't like when he stops speaking English and starts saying things in the other language. 

I don't know if he's saying something cruel. Another time he said an insult that translates to sucking his dick. 

The thing is he hasn't stopped and we just had a disagreement and started angrily walking around the house saying things in the other language and I feel done with this marriage because at this point it's disrespectful. I wouldn't have a problem if he had never insulted me in this language while fighting since he's done it on at least two occasions that I know of, I always wonder what he's saying and the situation escalates.


Another thing that really gets me is when we have sex, he only speaks to me in English because he ""prefers it that way"". 



**Tl; Dr:** Husband has insulted me in his mother tongue when we fight so I asked him not to speak the language when we fight but he refuses. I'm fed up and thinking of leaving him."
"What do you do with that time between realizing you're in love and being ready to move in/be engaged?


Hi all, so recently, my boyfriend (34) and me (f, 33) have realized we're in love, after 6 months of dating. We've done vacations together, and have great conflict resolution skills. We live about an hour apart (opposite ends of a major city)  
and neither of us can give up where we live for at least another year (I just renewed my lease, he owns a house he's midway through doing a remodel on)  
So... what happens in this middle period of a relationship? Is it normal to really care about someone and not be ready to move in? How do we keep the intimacy growing? Right now we're alternating weekends, but it jus tdoesn't feel like enough time together, for both of us.  
TLDR: we can't move in together for a year but I want our connection to grow stronger. How?"
"My 17F Mother 49F Regulates how often I Shower


Hey Reddit. This one might be a little peculiar. Some obligatory backstory:

I've had this issue since I was about 11, growing up and experiencing things for the first time. I'd come home from a long day at school feeling absolutely disgusting and ask my mom if I could shower. If I showered the day before or two days before she'd start arguing with me as to how I showered yesterday and I didn't need to shower, despite my arguments of having P.E that day or my hair needed to be washed or I felt unclean. She'd also time my showers to be five minutes, going so far as to buy a little timer specifically for the bathroom and make me time myself whenever I showered. Anybody that has experienced puberty knows that five minutes is not enough time to get everything done in the shower, especially as a teen girl. A shower longer than five minutes would mean I was wasting water, so she'd bang on the door, or turn off the power until I got out. I

One time when I was about fifteen I was shaving my legs and refused to get out until I was finished because I had swimming at school the next day which led to my mother banging on the door screaming at me and eventually, trying to get into the bathroom. She broke the bathroom lock.

In recent years since we've moved it hasn't been quite as bad but she still regulates how long and how often I shower. Getting a bath has helped but has opened a while other can of worms with her complaining when I leave the immersion(?) On or even want to have a bath in the first place.

The topic that brought this up was that she was already in a bad mood when I woke up, but when I went downstairs she asked me to go to the shop with her and help her carry the groceries home. I said sure, let me just have a quick shower first and she went ballistic. I have not showered in about 4 days and feel absolutely revolting, so we argued and I ended up saying I'm not going anywhere without having a shower. She stormed out the door without me and here I am waiting for the shower to heat up.

I am sick and tired of having to ask my mom when I can shower. Does anyone have any advice as to what I could do or say to get her to be more lenient?

Cheers.

Tldr; my mom regulates how often I shower"
"My (34/F) best friend (31/F) solicits advice about her toxic relationship constantly, yet won't end it.


TLDR; My best friend has been in a toxic relationship for the last 2 years. She is always telling me about how horrible her boyfriend is, and asks for advice, but never follows it. She insists on continuing the relationship. I'm fed up but afraid of ultimatums.

&amp;#x200B;

My dearest friend, we'll call her Anna, has been with Bill for the last two years. During this time, he has displayed incredibly selfish, abusive and disturbing behavior. Because this behavior reflects poorly on him, he has put a gag order on Anna against telling me or any of our other friends about what he's said and done. He claims he is worried that I will hate him, as he is extremely concerned with my and my fiance's impressions of him as a person. My response to this has repeatedly been, ""If he doesn't want me to think he's an asshole, then he needs to stop doing asshole-things. Just because I don't know about it, doesn't mean he didn't do it."" She agrees wholeheartedly, to my face. 

This has caused her to be isolated from her friends and close family. Since she is only allowed to talk about the good parts of their relationship/his behavior, she rarely has much to report at all.

Some examples of his behavior include: 1. Storming off drunkenly after an argument, leaving her alone in the middle of the night in two different major cities, on two separate occasions, to fend for herself. 2. Calling her selfish and manipulative because she wants to spend weekend nights with her friends (they both live together and work from home, so they spend all day, every day together). In fact, he consistently accuses her of being a liar and trying to screw him over, though no specifics are ever discussed or pointed out. It's always generalized, paranoid accusations that she is trying to ruin his life. 3. Gets black out drunk and starts arguments with her friends, family and roommate. This is just scratching the surface, but these are repeated behaviors and not one-off instances of him being a jerk. 

Anna has, on many occasions, put off having serious talks with him about his drinking and behavior due to various events taking place in her life, such as her grad school graduation, birthdays, Christmas, planned vacations, and basically anything else she can use as a stalling tactic to, at the very least, having a serious talk with him about their issues. She has mentioned to me also that she doesn't want to have to explain to everyone why Bill isn't there/why she's attending ""x"" event without a boyfriend. I've told her multiple times that this is no reason to subject herself to the abuse and turmoil that comes from being in the relationship. 

I've been as transparent and honest with her as I possibly can be during this ordeal, as these things are the basis of what I would consider to be a great friendship. We've always been proud of how honest and open we can be with each other, and I feel it would be a disservice to her if I wasn't still truthful about my feelings in this situation. I've told her that I am worried about her, given her advice when she asks, based on what I would do myself if it were me in her place, given her suggestions regarding what I think may help, from suggesting couple's therapy, individual therapy, trying to spend more time apart during the week, to basically anything I can think of short of telling her flat-out to break up with him...

...and here's where I think I am being selfish, folks. I've seen what happens when our other friends have told her to dump him. She cuts them off one by one and furthers her isolation and codependency on him. My fear that she will also cut me off has kept me from outright telling her to break up with him, but it's also not really my place. She is an adult and can make her own decisions. She recognizes, by her own admission, that he is emotionally abusive and unstable. I have told her very clearly that I think she deserves better, that he is unstable and abusive and that this is a very unhealthy relationship and she shouldn't be subjected to this anymore. I can't help but keep thinking that she will one day be free from him, and when that time comes, she's going to need a friend. It breaks my heart to think of her alone/alienated and dealing with the aftermath of a bad break up, which this definitely has the potential of being. I am also concerned about the prospect of losing my best friend over this fart-hamper. 

I'm now not sure where exactly I can go from here. There have been multiple instances where she's come over to my house and I've stayed up well past 3 or 4 AM just listening to her vent months worth of bullshit behavior he's displayed, yet she still refuses to do anything more than just give him a stern talking-to and he shapes up for a few weeks before going back to his old ways. I'm tired. I think I give good advice and I think about what I tell her very carefully so my replies aren't based on knee-jerk emotional response, but it's draining. I've gotten frustrated with her in the past and told her that if she is truly upset by his behavior, then she needs to do something about it or stop complaining, but it's easy to say that when you're not the one in the abusive situation. I'm worried about my friend above all. She has been depressed and anxious for the last several months, which she told me is a result of his behavior. When she's told him about her mental state, he tells her that she's lazy and to exercise and drink more water. Right now, they're on vacation in another country and she is terrified he will propose to her, as he has been bringing it up to her in a roundabout way for the last several months, and he even sent me some photos of rings via text to get my opinion. I've brushed these off saying that she would probably want to be involved in the choosing of a ring, since she is very particular about what she wears. I just don't want any part in that mess. When I asked how she felt about the potential proposal, she replied with, ""Nauseated."" 

Should I just grit my teeth and tell her to either break up with him or stop asking me for advice we both know she won't follow? I am afraid of the potential result(s) of that ultimatum, honestly, but I don't know what else to do at this point. If you've made it this far, congrats! I wish I had some sort of prize to give you, like your time back. Thanks for reading."
"Apparently girlfriends stealing your jacket is a thing? M15 F14


I was confused about some random hoodie meme and my friend told me it's pretty common for girlfriends to steal your jacket. Something about boyfriend smell and warmth. Never heard of that before, but I think that sounds adorable and just the right amount of romantic. Would it be weird to just give mine to my gf? Like just as a random gift thing? It's my first real relationship, so I'm very inexperienced with this sort of thing. We've been dating for three months. Would that come across as possessive? I do intend to ask her first, of course. She's usually the more logical and pragmatic one, while I tend to lean towards the more emotional and admittedly naive. I feel like it's something she might like, but I'm not absolutely sure. 

TL;DR!: Heard that gf stealing your jacket is common, thought that sounded really cute and romantic. Would it come across as possessive to just give mine to her as a random gift sort of thing? I'm going to ask her first ofc."
"My [26M] sister [15F] suddenly told me she doesn't like it when I kiss her. Did I do something wrong?


I sometimes randomly give a kiss on the head, or pet her head, or rub her shoulders if I'm passing by and she's there. I never thought she'd be uncomfortable by this and she never said anything about not liking it.

On Saturday though, we were waiting in line to watch a movie. I left the line for a few minutes and when I came back I kissed her head, and she turned around and sullenly told me she didn't like that. I was like, OK...? Because she had never said anything about it and suddenly she was mad that I was doing it.

I asked her why it made her uncomfortable and she said she didn't know, but it just did.

So, OK, I get that. I'll try to not do it anymore unless she says she wants me to, but, why would she randomly not like it? Or maybe was it that I did something wrong in taking the liberty to kiss her? I don't know, I always thought it was alright and like I said, she had never said anything.

She actually used to like having cuddles with me when she was younger (7-11), but I get it if she doesn't want it anymore.

Did I do something wrong to make her mad?

**tl;dr:** Sister suddenly doesn't like it that I kiss her or rub her shoulders. Did I do something wrong?"
"I (F24) already want to divorce my husband (M25) and it hasn't even been a year.


We had been dating a little over two years when we got married, engaged for one year, married since October.
Everything was great and we got along just fine! 
However, after we got married it feels like things changed. He became more controlling (has to know where I'm at at all times and will text me to ""check up"" on me when I'm visiting with a friend). 
He would get on me about my weight and say that I was getting chunky. So I started going to a gym, now he complains that I don't spend enough time with him. 
I do not want kids and have made this very clear. However, he and his family will not stop pushing the idea on me and it makes me beyond uncomfortable. I've told him how it makes me feel when his mother says ""I mean... IFFFFF you have kids"". He says I need to stop playing the victim. 
He makes me feel worthless sometimes and like I'm not enough. He said I need to ""pull my weight"" around the house by either paying for my portion of the rent and bills, or being more ""like a housewife"". 

He said when we have kids I will be staying home to be a stay at home mom. I will drop my career and my friends will consist of other moms. I'm currently in a certificate program to further my earning potential. So he'd want me to give that up in two years to raise his kids. 

The sex is absolutely awful. I've tried to talk to him about it and see if we can try new things. He says no. 

I feel trapped financially. If I leave, I'm homeless with nothing. 

Advice is appreciated. I can also clarify questions as well. 

TL;DR I am unhappy in my marriage and my husband isn't willing to work on it or take any blame."
"“Re-caught” my (f27) fiancé (m30) in an old lie. Are my feelings valid?


I (f27) learned last year that my fiancé (m30) had met up with/had initial strong feelings for a girl about two months into our relationship after we made things “official”. We have been together now 4 years or so. He felt she was “gorgeous” and he had the “most fun with her on those dates” than any other dates he had been on at the time (ie more fun with her than me). Found out about this through his friend and he even wrote about it in the margins of the book he let me borrow. Basically, this situation was corroborated. 

I confronted him last year, and he whole-heartedly denied it. I moved on, though I never forgot and still get twinges if unease and hurt if the memory came up. 

This weekend, I was on his phone (with his permission) on Facebook. went to type in our friend’s name and the recent searches came up. I see this girl and my gut dropped. I knew it was her - I clicked on her page and once I saw her place of work I confirmed it was indeed her. He had been looking her up recently. 

They are not friends on Facebook, he is faithful, loving, and kind, but this makes me nervous. I brought this to my attention and he had a story about how they have mutual friends and this is not the girl he met previously (kind of owning up to something he previously denied). Then he gets mad at me for snooping and it all got turned on me and I end up apologizing. 

I’m just so frustrated. I KNOW he met a girl and that this girl was the one. Now he is searching for her and keeping tabs. I know this isn’t out of the ordinary for people to do, but what bothers me most is his lying and turning it around at me. Are my feelings valid? I can’t seem to shake this sad, uneasy feeling. 

TL;DR - fiancé keeps denying that he has met with a girl a couple years ago that I have proof he did. He turns my questions around on me and gets angry and I end up saying sorry. I feel sad and uneasy about it all. Am I overreacting?"
"How do I tone things down in a new relationship?


I'm 40M, she is 35F.

In short, I was married to a wonderful woman who passed away a decade ago. She was my first proper relationship, my only sexual relationship, and was my world. We had two children, and were very happy. Her death devastated me.

A couple of years ago I decided to dip my toe back into things, and so started to use OKC, Tinder, Bumble, etc. I met some interesting people on them, including a couple I thought that had potential, but they fizzled out.

A couple of months ago I was matched with a smart, beautiful woman. We had a lot of mutual interests, and talked a lot. She went on to ask me out, and we had a fun day out. We repeated that a couple of times, and all was great.

I stayed over at her place recently for about 3 days. It was magical. We slept together for the first time, and after some initial performance anxiety, it went amazingly. I am falling for her hard, and she has said the same to me.

I'm just concerned that I'm going too fast. I can see a future with this woman (to quote Scott Pilgrim, ""with jetpacks""), and she is fast becoming the first thing I think of in the morning and the last thing at night. She is wonderful, sexy, intelligent. In many ways she is a better match for me than my wife, and I've already given myself a guilt trip when I realised that.

She seems into me just as much as I'm into her. We're getting tested for STDs this week (I know, nothing says romance like that, right?) so that we can become more intimate. Waking up next to her in the morning was wonderful. When I'm not with her, I'm thinking about her.

I should not be this into someone I've known for perhaps two months, right? I tend to burn hot and heavy in relationships (my wife and I were the exact same way, so I'm sensing a pattern there). I feel like a giddy schoolboy again, but this woman has captured me, and I want to make sure I set us up for the best possible future we can have.

tl;dr: Really into a new woman after a decade of being single. Trying to make sure I don't screw things up by moving too quickly on anything."
"I [27F] never had a boyfriend fall in love with me, I’ve been pursued by men and experienced a whirlwind honeymoon and then they check out or cheat. I have learned to stop trusting so quickly, but it’s also making me feel dead inside. What can I do to help myself?


I know these posts can get long and ranty so I’ll try to keep it brief and share the basics 

1. First boyfriend was emotionally abusive. I had to be told to leave the relationship by loved ones after he openly yelled at me at a wedding for looking in the direction of a dude he didn’t like. He used to go visit his ex to “council” her on evenings I was spending with his family and him. He exhibited signs of emotional abuse, and one time did grab me hard enough to leave bruises. I was 18.

2. Second boyfriend cheated on me with my own cousin, which is totally twisted. He texted her against my wishes, she didn’t consider my feelings either making it unbearable painful to discover after he break up. He also told her he stopped finding me attractive and that destroyed my confidence in my body and looks. He treated me badly in an effort to get me to dump him. The whole time I was just confused and upset. After two years with him, It broke my heart severely. I lost so much weight my dad begged me to eat or he would admit me to hospital. My first deep heartache was a rough ride. It took a while to love myself again. I went to therapy. I was 22

3. Third boyfriend was a friend of 7 years, dates me right after a breakup. We were long distance and 4 months in he cancels his second flight 2 weeks before the scheduled Christmas visit. He is engaged to his ex 3 months later. Married in 4 month. I was 24.

4. Forth boyfriend was also long term, I was 25, he was 9 years older. Also was texting his ex behind my back. Left me for her in the same way boyfriend number 2 did. He’s now engaged to her. Through all these past boyfriends their families were embarrassed and often took my side, which wasn’t as nice as it sounds... just cut deeper to know I was enough for everyone except the men I dated. I was 25

Since then I’ve faced a lot of trouble with dating. Mainly just getting involved with men who are trying to get sex and nothing else from men. Often I give people a chance to prove themselves, even if my first impression is a little off about them. 

I meet up with men I think are wonderful, kind, and ambitious... but they typically are looking for someone different or have lots of options. I know I present myself well, I look after myself, stay fit. I am known by people who’s opinions I trust and care about to be kind and caring and generous and can command conversation with a good story and I’m good with/to their kids and I have a broad range of interests and a successful full time job and part time business I manage. 

I always go into each situation with a sense of optimism but lately I feel totally beaten down. I cry most nights because I feel like something is deeply flawed with me. I’ve been on many many dates since my last relationship... it’s the first time I’ve “dated” instead of just gone into one serious relationship after another but I feel like something inside me is dying slowly, or being suffocated. I’ve never been loved... really loved, and I’m dreading the idea that it might never happen. What can I do to give myself the best chance at a fulfilling partnership?

TL;DR: I have been cheated on a lot, and I know I have a lot to offer someone special but I’m losing that courage to put myself out there because I repeatedly get smacked down or involved with someone who is just trying to get something out of me. I need constructive criticism"
"Friend (35F) keeps saying people are looking at her, I'm (29F) getting annoyed


I have a new friend. I've known her about 9 months. She is really nice and fun. She is a little quirky, dresses a bit quirky, tries lots of different makeup styles. Problem is - she keeps pointing out how people are staring at her. And it is starting to annoy me.

I have absolutely no problem with people wanting to look different, change up their styles. Do your thing. My friend who I'll call Tess tends to do really extreme makeup - like IG models come to life. If anyone has seen IG models in person, you know it's very, very thick and obvious makeup that may look good on camera, but very noticeable in real life. Whenever we go somewhere, she will say, ""Did you see those girls look at me?"" ""That guy just stared at me for the longest time."" ""That girl looked at me like she wanted to say something."" Tess - how can you be oblivious to the fact that they are staring at you for a reason?

It's basically like, she does something for attention, when people give her attention, she kind of acts surprised like, why are they paying attention to me? Except I KNOW THAT SHE HAS TO KNOW. Maybe I'm being kind of mean, but it's been months of this. 

I don't know if I should say something, call her out, leave her alone, make a joke about it, or just kind of slowly fade out. I don't dislike her - she's a nice person. But this habit is starting to grate me badly. Should I say something? Let it go?

TLDR: Friend wears thick, super dramatic makeup and then keeps saying ""that guy is staring at me,"" ""those girls were looking at me."" It annoys me, but I know she's not a bad person. Should I call her out? Leave her alone? Am I bad person if I want to slowly stop hanging out?"
"Is it ok to not know if he’s “the one”?


22F here. I hear so many married couples saying “I knew my wife was the one the day I met her”. I’ve been in a two year relationship with someone I love dearly and admire for his kindness and care towards me and he feels the same for me. However, I don’t necessarily know if he’s the one I’m going to marry. Which is normal considering I’m young and haven’t got a clue about many things in my life.

Married couples, have you always known for certain that your spouse is “the one”? Or has that been something that you realize later on? I don’t think that he’s not the one but I also don’t know if he is the one right now.

TL;DR: my boyfriend and I love each other very much but I don’t know whether he’s “the one” YET and that’s perfectly ok and doesn’t mean our relationship will fail right??"
"Ex-mother-in-law (F 50s) needs emotional support from me (F 35) Husband (M 32) bothered by this


So this is kind of a twisty one, I'll do my best to be clear. 

I've been divorced from my first husband for 5 years. We have a 13yo son together. My son and I are both very close to my ex mother in law. She is a wonderful sweet woman who has been extremely generous and supportive to me in my life. Especially in my son's babyhood, as I was a very young mother. We lived with them for the 3 years after he was born and she was another parent to him and to me. I love her like my own mom.

My ex cheated on me and left me for another woman. After we divorced my relationship with his mom became more distant, but was still warm. He and his new wife are geographically close to her and obviously, I don't want to be invasive in their lives. I've been pleasant, but left connecting up to her for the most part. She isn't naturally an out going person and so I make she knows I'm thinking about her, send pictures and updates about her grandson, etc. I was surprised this past week when she texted me and told me that we needed to talk. She told me that her husband of 33 years has met another woman online and has been having an affair for 2 years. She wanted to talk to me about this because it effects my son's summer visit (she helps my ex with him while he's at his dad's, (honestly my son spends more time with her than his dad) and also wanted to talk to me because I've been through it. Her soon to be ex is still living at her house. I absolutely will not put my son in that sort of toxic situation. He's lived through one divorce already and it was horrible. I've encouraged his dad to take time off and plan a trip for him and my son so that they get time together this summer and he agreed that's best.

My best friend from childhood and I married brothers. She is still married to my ex-brother-in-law and they have a child. We've been working recently on re-establishing our connection, that had grown cooler due to distance and some disagreement. This friendship began long before I even knew my ex and she has been my dearest friend. I care about her a lot and it's very important to me that we repair our relationship. Our children are first cousins and my ex-mother-in-law is her mother-in-law. 

I have been talking to my EXMIL a lot over the past week. She's sharing a lot with me and I'm very concerned about her. She's so heartbroken. I'm very upset for her and I am trying to offer understanding and advice and just be there to listen to her. She's very depressed. 

My best friend and her husband (ex-brother-in-law) and child were just at my house for a visit and while they were here we discussed my visiting them with my son and possibly inviting EXMIL to come with me. They both live in other states. One six hours one direction, the other seven hours in the other direction. I had talked to my husband about it previously, with best friend in front of him, with EXMIL briefly and also with my own mom. 

My mom thinks this is strange and she tells me that this isn't my family anymore and that I should consider my husband. I told my husband what she said. Today I sat down with my husband and told him that I wanted to start solidifying plans with all involved for this trip. Suddenly he has a huge problem with the trip, my talking to my EXMIL, my ""ex-brother-in-law's wife"" - all of it. 

I'm pissed. This has nothing to do with these people being my ex-in-law-family. These are two women I love. This is my son's grandmother, aunt and cousin. I wouldn't even SEE my ex. It has absolutely nothing to do with him. My old friend specifically said that I needed to visit her next, as she's been to my state twice since I've been to hers. If I don't go visit her after saying I would it's going to set us back. It might even be the end of our reconciliation. My mother in law needs time with my son. I'm so upset about every aspect of this and I don't know what to do. 

TLDR: Husband is upset that I want to spend time and emotional effort supporting my ex-mother-in-law and family through her husband's infidelity."
"My [27F] husband [27M] has betrayed me and lied to me about some very serious things--an STD and drugs. I don't know what to do or if I can ever forgive him. What do I do?


I originally posted some of this on a throwaway but I just don't really care at this point. So I'm posting on my main. This is loooooong.

Husband and I have been together for 3.5 years, got married five months ago. We work at the same company, which is where we met. He's in the field, I'm in the office.

A month ago I found out that my husband was lying to me about having HPV. He was diagnosed with a genital-wart-causing strain of HPV right before we started dating and he never told me. In fact, he always told me he was 100% tested and clean prior to us becoming sexually active and throughout our relationship. Long story short, I found the cream he was prescribed for his warts a month ago while he was out of town. It's a HUGE betrayal and we are currently in couples therapy. I have really struggled with this but I decided to remain committed to him and our marriage. I have been working really hard in therapy and I have been so supportive of him and us. He has sworn UP AND DOWN over the last few weeks that he is not lying about anything else. And that he sees how much this lie has devastated me and that he will never hide anything from me again.

The betrayal was a huge shock to me and has obviously made me wary of trusting him again. I asked him to get retested and prove to me that he wasn't lying about having any other STDs, so he went and got tested and showed me the results. 

He also requested his medical records from his doctor who diagnosed him initially and has been treating him. I started looking at the records last night and noticed that some pages were missing. Like it would go from page 1 of 4 to page 3 of 4. I'm sure you can see where this is going. I questioned him on the missing pages a few times before he finally admitted that he threw away two of the pages before he gave me the records. Apparently those pages say that he actually had more warts than he told me (at least 6 instead of 2) at various times throughout the relationship and that the doctor had frozen them off instead of him just using a cream like he told me. 

I was livid. Why even lie about that and try to hide the records from me??? How would hiding the facts that the some of the warts had been frozen off instead of being treated with cream make things better? The fact that they were frozen off doesn't make the situation any worse, so why lie about it? I started asking him what else he was keeping from me. Because why CONTINUE to lie after the big lie already came out and you've promised me you would NEVER lie to me again???

I start asking, ""what else are you lying to me about?"" He says ""nothing"" and I ask him again probably ten more times until he tells me the truth. Apparently not only has he been lying to me about an STD for 3 years and then continued to lie to me after that came out, he has also been lying to me about taking drugs a few times since we've been together. As recently as this past Christmas (one month before our wedding). Let me preface this by saying that we have always had a firm (I thought) understanding that we do not take illegal drugs. I am very against it and he has always agreed that it is not something either of us do in this relationship. He also works a sensitive position at the company we both work for, which means he is subject to random drug testing. If he fails a drug test, he could lose his job. So he starts telling me that he took Percocets that his brother-in-law gave him a few times over the last few years, the most recent time being Christmas 2018 when we visited his parents.

I'm still in shock over this. I thought I married an honest, responsible, respectful man with integrity. He is literally the opposite of those things. He risked our financial security, his career, my reputation at the same company, our fucking marriage, everything....over what? He had sex with me for THREE YEARS knowing I was exposed to an STD and never told me. He got high knowing the consequence was him losing his job, our livelihood, my future. His orgasms and highs were clearly more important than our fucking trust, our marriage, the love and honesty I've ALWAYS given him, my health, my career, our security.

I'm beside myself. I've been working so hard over the last month in and out of therapy to get us through this. And even through that he's been lying. How can I have a future with this person? How can I have children with this person? How can I trust him with our finances, our home, our future kids, me? How can I know he won't drag me down with him through his clearly self-destructive behavior? It's like I'm married to a stranger. I don't know this person. What do I do? Do I stay? Do I leave? Can he change? I'm rambling. If you've read down this far, thank you.

&amp;#x200B;

**TL;DR:** Husband has a lying problem and is making bad life decisions. I'm afraid of getting dragged down with him. I'm afraid of never gaining back our trust. I'm afraid there's more he's lying about. I'm afraid that he's a stranger to me and can't change. What should I do?"
"Are my (F32) feelings toward my apathetic husband (M34) justified?


 

I've never posted here. I guess I just want to hear from an objective outsider. Are my feelings justified?

&amp;#x200B;

We married 5 years ago. At the time, he was in excessive  student loan debt (six figures), which in itself probably should have  been a huge red flag.

&amp;#x200B;

It has become the  albatross around MY neck, because he isn't worried. We are in our early  30s. Our friends are all buying houses, having children, buying new  cars, traveling around the world, contributing extra to 401ks.  We are  still renting, driving beaters, going camping, and contributing the bare  minimum to retirement.

&amp;#x200B;

I  save as much as possible so that we can actually have savings and buy a house. He saves nothing, so if not for  me, we would have none. I work a second job, too. He refuses to work a second job (he works 40 hrs/week btw).  And so as the years go on, as I get up at 5:30 on the weekends to go work more, the resentment grows.

&amp;#x200B;

All  his money goes to the loans, as he is still in debt. How much? When  will it be paid off? I don't know. He never bothers to tell me. I have  BEGGED, cried,  and threatened to leave over the issue of him just  TELLING me his financial info and for us to sit down and make a financial plan. He makes promises DURING  the fight, but once we cool down, he drops it. It ceases to matter. His  whole attitude is ""I can't do anything about it, so why worry.""

&amp;#x200B;

I  had to BEG him to consolidate his loans (they were all private and near  12% interest). And this APATHY extends to every other facet of his  life. He NEVER sees his family, and consequently, I have no relationship  with my nieces and nephews. He NEVER comes up with a plan to do  something. If I don't come up with things for us to do on the weekend,  we don't do anything! He NEVER cleans ANYTHING. I have played the ""how  long can I go without cleaning this before he wipes it down"" game, and I  have lost. I often feel like I spend my  life doing all of the things I want to do, and he tags along. It isn't a  partnership.

&amp;#x200B;

Meanwhile  I am running out of time to have children (32), especially as I have  medical problems that will make it more difficult.  I truly fear that we  will run out of time because of those damn loans. And he is  00% unconcerned. We used to talk about baby names, and I stopped.  Because it just gets my hopes up. I was 27 when we married and we were  ""going to have kids in two years."" One year passed, and another, and  another, and  another.....

&amp;#x200B;

And  now I am 32. And now I am tired because I need to get up tomorrow and  go work while he sleeps in. And now I am planning to eventually just  take my savings and leave, since he doesn't seem to care one iota.

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR! : Marriage falling apart due to loans; husband couldn't care less. Are my feelings justified?"
"(30m) My wife (27f) went back to Japan to attend her friend's wedding two months ago, today, I found her friend's social media and some of the photos are questionable...


My wife is Japanese and we have been married for almost 5 years ago. Met in college, she was a exchange student, now we live in Los Angeles with two kids. Two months ago, she went back to Japan for her friend's wedding for 2 weeks, I couldn't go due to work. Everything was good, she came back said she had a great trip, I didn't really ask too much about it.

Today, while bored at work, I was browsing twitter for the first time in like a while (I don't use much social media stuff, so you know it was a slow day, I've exhausted reddit before checking twitter)

I was bored and tried to find my wife's friends account and somehow I managed to find it. (she doesn't use twitter herself, but I know her friends in Japan do). And what do I see? photos of my wife at some post wedding party as what I think is the ""Bridesmaid"", but somehow she's wearing a wedding dress herself with her friend. I guess that's normal, but then I saw photos of guys I've never seen before, hugging her, she's literally being carried in some guy's arms while wearing a wedding dress, photos of her being carried on someone's back, ones where her face is almost centimeters close to another dude I've never seen before. 

I started digging after I saw those photos, through a bunch of Japanse accounts, google translate, found the guy she was with's twitter. There were dozens of photos of my wife and him, I think all from when she went back, at bars, restaurants, and what seemed like dates. One of them was a hotel room photo with some expensive wine and champagne, like one of those typical instagram photos that younger kids post these days, and I was stunned because I recognized the louis vuitton bag I bought her, it was just there sitting in the chair. I tried to tell myself it was a coincidence and that's someone else's bag. I had to infer everything and at one point I felt stupid, almost as if I'm overreading it since they could just be friends, I'm just being overly paranoid thinking they went to a hotel together. I couldn't concentrate at all today, got home and making this post as quick as I could...

What do I do? Do I confront her? There's no evidence for anything so maybe I'm overly paranoid? She's out right now and will be coming back after picking up the kids from her sisters place. What do I do? Am I just overreacting?

tl;dr - Wife went to Japan for 2 weeks a while ago, I found her friend's twitter account today and there were questionable photos of her and some guy I've never seen before... Need some advice about my situation..."
"I JUST caught my [33F] wife of 6 years cheating on me [34M] and we have a toddler


I cannot believe this. I JUST found evidence on my wife's phone that she's been cheating on me with her co-worker [29M] (*for at least a month - probably longer*). She has grown a lot closer to him in the last 2-3 years, and closer of late (they went out Saturday together). Although I questioned their relationship (and so did HIS GF), she always MAINTAINED that it was plutonic and they were just good friends. **I'm so fucking naive.**  
&amp;nbsp;

So I was going through her pictures on her phone looking for some recent vacation pictures of our (almost) 3 year old daughter, and **THERE THEY WERE** 3 VERY incriminating pictures that she forgot to delete. One of which was a picture of said co-worker **IN MY BED, ON MY SIDE OF THE BED**. There's also a selfie/sext from co-worker on March 26th, so I don't even know how long this has truly been going on!!  
&amp;nbsp;

I'm heartbroken, I thought I was going to be with this woman for the rest of my life. Over the last year or so her sex drive has all but disappeared. We had sex **ONCE** this year (/r/DeadBedrooms was visited on more than one occasion). I've addressed it, we've **TALKED** about it, and she keeps coming to the conclusion that she's not sexual - and she dropped a big ""she does NOT find me sexually attractive"" on me about 3 weeks ago (AFTER the events on her phone mind you). We were going to see a marriage counselor next week to try and work on this aspect of our relationship, as everything else was seemingly fine.     
&amp;nbsp;

I think my marriage is over, my trust is completely broken with this woman. We have a beautiful ~3 year old, and now I'm imagining a life where I only get to see 50% of my child. I am physically shaking as I'm writing this as I cannot fathom being away from my daughter or her not having her mommy and daddy.  
&amp;nbsp;

I am completely lost right now. We own a house, cars, have events planned for months out, we're both very close with each others family.....my whole life is crashing down and I'm really scared and I really really need some advice from /r/relationships. What do I do?

I'm sorry for the wall of text, and if this sounds like a rant and disjointed, but my mind is racing right now and I don't know where to start.  
&amp;nbsp;

I'm located in Ontario, Canada if that matters at all.  
&amp;nbsp;


TL;DR - wife of 6 years cheated on me, IN OUR MARITAL BED, I found picture evidence, we have a toddler and I'm devastated!!! What the fuck do I do!?"
"My boyfriend wants his family to move in with us


 

My (F32) boyfriend (M30) wants his brother (28) and his brother's girlfriend(27) to move in with us and I'm dreading it.

I  met my boyfriend two years ago and he owns a small two bedroom house. I  moved in about a year ago. Up until recently he rented the other room to a quiet guy who I  rarely saw and only stayed in the house a few times a month.

My  bf lived with his brother before and apparently there was an unspoken  agreement that they would live together again once this quiet guy moved  out.

However,  I was never asked about whether I would be okay with this situation and  I am really, really done with having roommates. I've lived with 25  people in the last ten years and I just feel I'm over that stage of my  life (we've been speaking a lot recently about having a baby in the near future).

He  suggested a compromise that they  move in for six months and I agreed  but now I'm feeling resentful about the whole situation. They are a  great couple and we hang out all the time but I just don't want other  people in my living space. My boyfriend's opinion is that it will be  really fun to have them around.

I  work from home, which hasn't been going well recently and my boyfriend  travels a lot with his job, so there could be two week bursts where I'll  be here by myself with them.

This  is the only thing we've fought about in the last few months and I can't  seem to let go of the anger I feel about this decision being made  without me. I don't want to damage my relationship with his family but I feel like I've really been screwed over. My boyfriend is a great guy but he just can't seem to see where I'm coming from or why this is making me so anxious. 

&amp;#x200B;

Do I just have to suck it up and accept that it's happening? Is he wrong or am I overreacting? 

&amp;#x200B;

TL:DR -My boyfriend agreed to let his brother move in with us and didn't ask me first."
"Found my (40F) husband (45M) making out with my daughter’s childhood friend (21F)


This is highly embarrassing and I can’t bring myself to discuss it even with my closest friends. I figured that typing this would be therapeutic for me and getting advice from strangers would help a bit. Please don’t judge me, it’s my first post here after using reddit for other purposes. 

My husband and I have been married for 18 years and we have 2 kids together (18 and 21 yo). We’ve been living in this home forever, we moved in around the same time as our nextdoor neighbors so our children grew up together. They have a son and a daughter almost the same ages as ours. I have always worked full time, was never a SAHM, so I am sort of accepting some blame for maybe not being always available and present to satisfy my husband’s needs. As far as I know, he never cheated before but after this, I’m not that sure. We had a good marriage, never argued for more than 2 minutes, no insults ever, etc. Our sex life hasn’t been porn level but we aren’t lacking either (in my opinion that is). 

Yesterday evening I went out with a girl friend and came back a little earlier than expected because of the weather. Parked the car in the driveway (I usually park in the garage, otherwise they would’ve heard the garage door opening), entered the house and walked in on my husband half naked on top of a woman. I couldn’t see who the person was until he jumped up. It was the neighbors’ daughter, whom I’ve known since she was 2 years old. I froze. I literally couldn’t move or say anything and felt like I was gonna faint. My husband started babbling something but I was so out of it, I didn’t hear anything he said. She gathered her clothes and stormed out. My husband started crying and sat on the couch with his head down. I did a 180 turn, got in my car and drove to a friend where I spent the night. 

I’m now on lunch break at work and can’t focus on anything. He sent me a few texts apologizing. However, he also wanted me to know that they had slept together before and this has been going on for a while. He told me that, allegedly, because “the truth would come out anyway and I want you to hear it in full from me”. This hurts immensely. I can’t even describe it. I feel betrayed. I would’ve rather have him cheat with a stranger, not the person I considered my own child for the longest time. I can’t believe this happened. I haven’t talked to my kids yet. They’re living on their own. I’m so lost and upset. Please guide me. 

What’s my next step? Should I tell the kids? Should I go back home and have an adult discussion with him? Thank you all. 

TL;DR: found my husband cheating with the neighbor daughter"
"My (18/M) parents think I am abusive.



So my (18/M) little brother (15) has always been the little prince of the family, you know how it goes.
lately (as of the past few months) I have really grown more independent which has meant that I haven’t communicated with my parents as much as I used to. And in this time said little brother has been sitting on their right hand side and ultimately talking shit. 

First of all, they have somehow come to believe that I am abusive and hit my brother when they are not around, they believe this because when I was younger (around 8-11 or something) I did hit him,(usually playful, but always as brothers tend to do when they’re young). And this stigma has somehow been brought up from the dead and drilled into my parents heads. 

This has been on my mind but has really caught my attention tonight (it’s like 10pm), when I jumped in bed in our hotel room (I’m sharing with my brother, and my parents are in the room next door). My brother jumps off his bed and lands on the floor creating a thud (as a joke? I don’t know) and straight away my mom comes running in and screams “What did you do to him?!!” I am starting to get angry at this point because I hate it how they are at the point where they assume that I just abuse my brother when really I don’t.

I talked to him and he said that I really do and I just don’t understand where his point of view comes from. It is starting to get to me and I really need an external point of view because I do not want to give in and believe I am the monster my parents make me out to be. What do I do in this situation?

Tl;dr Little brother (15) talks shit about me (18/M) to parents, parents believe him and think he is unsafe around me. Me is sad."
"I [26M] went on a vacation trip with my friend [25F] and realized I don't like her at all. How do I proceed?


My friend and I met at work and we clicked instantly. Our friendship grew stronger over the months and we told each other very personal things/secrets close to us. We talked almost everyday and eventually decided it would be fun to travel together so we booked a vacation to Spain for a week. 

Important note, we are not sexually involved at all and are purely platonic. She's not my type and I'm not hers. 

On this trip, I got to know her even better and also got a chance to meet her close friends abroad. I realized she's classist, highly highly judgmental, and also a closet racist. She hates poor people even though she grew up poor (now her parents have money) and wants to marry a rich guy (confessed to being a gold digger). Once she gets pissed off she starts saying mildly racist things (a Vietnamese lady started yelling at us in Spain and my friend started calling her a short Asian bitch, among other things) and makes comments about people's appearances to get back at them. 

She's very good at getting people to open up to her, but the issue is, she uses this personal knowledge against people as soon as they have opinions that disagree with hers/start making better points in an argument. She then attacks people with the personal things they shared with her when they opened up to her. She's confessed this to me and is completely aware she does this. 

Unfortunately, the last twist is that she's also very attractive and at the top of the social chain among all my workmates. Guys are super nice to her, try to follow her on instagram/make moves on her, and all the girls are jealous of her. So she has a lot of social power. 

Sometimes I feel like speaking my mind to her and just telling her that she's a giant unlikable bitch, but I feel like she knows too much about me.

\*\*My question is, how do I remove her from my life and stop being her friend? I don't want to do it in a loud way because she knows some very personal things about me which I don't want her to blabber to everyone else out of anger - she is someone that would totally do that.\*\* Should I just slowly stop responding to her texts/chats? Maybe not make an effort anymore and she'll probably get bored and leave? Please help.

\*\*TL:DR - Became friends with a girl at work, realized she's not a good human being (there were some early red flags that I ignored) and is classist, a closet racist and just repulsive. She also has social power and knows some very personal things about my life...how do I quietly remove her from my life?\*\*"
"Long lost sister [19f] who our dad hid from us for years has suddenly come into our [14-17's] lives. We don't know how to handle all these emotions and the guilt that she's brought along..?


Hi, so this situation is going to drive us all crazy, as we don't know what else to do. We're going to try to make this make sense. There are 3 of us (16,16, 17) from our dad's 1st marriage with mom #1 (that's what we'll call her) the eldest of us's biological mom. Then there's our current mom (mom #2) who had (14,15,16). Now the reason why we're so close in age (and why there are 3 of us that are the same age from two different births) is because our dad had an affair with another woman which resulted in a pregnancy the same time mom #1 was pregnant with twin brothers (16's). He flat out told us when we were little kids that we all had seperate birth moms, and this was because he had two wives.  Despite this, we are all very close and we (from mom #1's marriage) see our stepmom as our real mother. We haven't known anything else, as she basically raised us. Whenever we would ask about our other mom, dad wouldn't really say much, or would change the subject. We've asked even if there were pictures of her from when they were together, and once a while ago, we got to see some. In almost all these pictures there was a girl that didn't look too much older than us, but our dad told us it was just a neighbors kid who was always over as mom #1 was friends with her mom.  Hope we haven't lost anyone just by that paragraph. 

Anyway, that turned out not to be true. Everything changed when within a week (about 3 months ago), there was this new girl living with us, who our dad said was our older sister. He sat us down and said that was who the girl in the pictures actually was. Our older sister, who he said mom #1 had taken one day and disappeared with. We asked why she only took our sister and not the rest of us, and he said because sister was her favorite (and we reminded her of his unfaithfulness or something). We're not too sure how true all that is, but she's here now. She looks so similar to us (older ones) it's creepy, there's no way she's just a random girl.  Mom #1 had died in a car crash, resulting in her being left by herself. 

Now the whole environment has changed, and I don't think we're making it better like we would like. As stupid as it sounds, we don't know how to really interact around a girl like that. It's mostly been a dominately male household. We are all in either rugby, football, or wrestling and can be quite physical with each other just in a general sense. That's how we play and ""bond"" in a way. But we are all much bigger than she is and it doesn't feel right trying to act like that toward her. We've tried involving her in things we do like video games, going out places etc. But she doesn't like video games, and the stuff we usually chat about when together isn't interesting for her. She's also very emotional and doesn't react well to how we usually talk (banter, bluntness) and how do you really comfort a girl when she's crying? It feels horrible standing there not knowing what to do whenever she's crying (usually from missing mom or homesickness ). At times there is tension from her blaming mom #2's kids for being the cause of all this. We don't know how to respond to that. She is hurt that we (mom #1's kids) have ""found a new mother"", which is not true. We have never known our real mom. She thinks that everyone hates her and doesn't see her as part of the family. 

So this Is our problem. She's our sister/half-sister. All this time we've missed out on really growing up with her and getting to know her, not even knowing she exists until now. How can we be good brothers? And how can we also maybe help her interact with mom #2 (who she hates and avoids as much as she can)? We couldn't possibly put all the information here so we will say more if you just ask.  Thank you for your advice. 

**tl;dr**: We have just found out that we have a sister. Now that she's living with us, we have noticed that we are clueless to really how to interact with a girl around our age living with us as we don't really have experience. What things can we do to make her more comfortable? Is there any way we can simmer down the tension between her and mom #2 ?"
"Aunt and uncle finally managed to adopt a kid. Brother is upset their not the cool aunt and uncle anymore.


Sorry for the title, but I don't know how else to explain this. 

My aunt and uncle (30M/29F) can't have kids of their own. Believe me when I tell you they tried their hardest to become parents. There was a day I walked in on my dad consoling my uncle because of this fact. They wanted to try and adopt a child because they really wanted to be parents and have a family. Well they managed it. They adopted Danny who's a 5 year old boy. He'd been in the foster system for years before they adopted him.All of my aunt and uncle's time is being devoted to Danny, because honestly he needs it. They're doing all sorts of activities with him and taking them places. 

Before they adopted him my aunt and uncle were very much the cool ones of the family. They have cool jobs and lifes. My brother (16M) is a little upset that they're focusing so much on Danny and haven't really been paying attention to is 

TL;DR: Brother is upset aunt and uncle haven't been paying a lot of attention to us since they adopted and wants to raise a fuss about it too them."
"Moved my boyfriend (30 m) and his daughter (4 f) into my (24 f) apartment temporarily. I'm exhausted.



My boyfriend has a 4 year old daughter and he just lost his job (not his fault, the store he worked at closed down) and then he also lost his apartment (his roommate was caught selling meth and they got evicted) and I moved them into my apartment for a short while. It's just a temporary thing; my own lease will be  up in 3 months and so my boyfriend will need to find his own place by then. Because ill be moving into a share house with 3 of my female friends, and they want the house to be girls only, and no kids.

I told my boyfriend I wasn't ready to take on a mothering role for his daughter. If be like a roommate, not like a parent. And it seems like he and I have different expectations of how living together will go.

A few times, as a favor, I'd watch his daughter when he was out and had asked me to. I mainly just gave her my old tablet to play game on, it wasn't like i was doing a lot. But then this week I've had to work long hours every day and he's been irritate with me that I need to work late and won't work from home while I watch her. (I am allowed to work from home but I prefer not to unless I'm home alone because i her distracted)

So, that was one thing. A bunch of times, his daughter had wanted to play and i sent her to her dad and he got irritated with me saying it wouldn't kill me to be a little more patient with her since we were all living together. 

I've also wanted her to get up at the time we get up, and sleep when we do, since she's been sleeping on the couch and i wanna be able to use the living room but that's been a struggle because my boyfriend has not been enforcing a bedtime and wake up time over summer vacation

Can I have some advice? I don't wanna go right to making an ultimatum that they're kicked out unless stuff changes but I'm going crazy here

TLDR - temporarily moved my boyfriend and his daughter in. It's been stressful"
"My Dad [58M] cheated on my Mom [58F] and everyone is bad mouthing my mom to me [24F]


Married 30 years, dad cheated on my mom 15 years ago, they stayed together, he begged. He was so embarrassed. Life went on. Last few years, they were drifting apart and slept in separate rooms, when I heard him talking on the phone late at night. He admitted he was talking someone, but ""just talking"". It's been months of me hearing these conversations but just thinking it was a friend.

That was the last straw, they're splitting up for real now, kids are grown, but my dad is still embarrassed about telling everyone him cheating is the reason for their split. But whenever I tell people (or talk to people who already know) that my parents are splitting, they always bad mouth my mom. They don't know the reason reason, nobody knows about the cheating, then and now, (and probably in between that we don't know about).

But it hurts to hear them talk when they don't know the full story. I'm respecting my dad's wishes by not saying the truth but in turn, i'm letting people shit talk my angel of a mother and blaming her for their divorce. My mom is also keeping the house so to everyone else it looks like she's ""throwing him out"". He hasn't left yet, she's giving him a chance to find somewhere comfortable and get on his feet. He's getting half the house, she's paying him off, that's hardly ""throwing someone out"" with nowhere to go. 

Anyone go through something similar?

TL;DR: Parents are splitting, dad cheated, doesn't want people to know, people think it's my mom's fault."
"Me [26M] with my gf [25F] together 2 yrs, I just found out she apparently stalked me for years before we met


TL;DR girlfriend knew about me and stalked me via social media and random acquaintances 7 years before we met, idk how to feel



My gf and I met nearly a year before we started dating. This was in 2016. We were chatting about some random things recently and I mentioned something from way back in late 2009/early 2010 or so when I was in high school. Then she blurted out some random details about the thing I was talking about. It was like in the movies when one character realizes the other said something they shouldn't know.



I was like, ""how do you know about that?"" And she tried playing it off like a mutual friend told her except the bulk of our mutual friends didn't know me back then and those that did weren't as close to me back then so they wouldn't have known. I asked her again in a firmer, harder voice how she knew that and she basically burst out into tears and confessed to having stalked me on social media since we were both back in high school.



She saw me on a friend list of a mutual friend and commenting on pics, liked my photos but was too shy to add me so basically just hardcore social media stalked me for years. And even made friends with people I knew in university who were in courses with me and would occasionally ask about me. She knew **a lot** about my past two relationships in 2009-2011 and 2012 - 2014. At least way more than someone I didn't meet until 2016 should know. She also had lots of pictures saved on her computer from back then. She was pretty much babbling and crying and begging me not to break up with her.




I do not know how to feel. It's been an amazing relationship but now I'm questioning whether that's real. She's a great partner or because she just kind of molded herself to be the sort of person I'd want. It also seriously freaks me out something fierce. And I'm noticing little things - if we've had the occasional argument she's always the first to want to make up, she's ultra affectionate and gets scary jealous of other people. I don't mind these things but now I'm wondering if it's just because she's with me. Like what would she be like with someone she hadn't stalked for years. 




I expressed discomfort at how close a friend of hers was [he was crazy in love with her] and she immediately cut him out of her life despite being friends for a decade plus. I had asked her to maybe put a bit of distance there and I remember thinking it was weird she just dropped this guy like she never knew him at all but didn't question it since she said you're much more important to me. 



She literally used to look at my facebook and Instagram photos multiple times per day. 



I feel so freaked out right now idk how to even properly express it.



But it's a great relationship. With a super stalker.



Part of me wants to break up but the other part wonders if this is just a major bump we'll have to get over with lots of work.



How do I begin to deal with this?"
