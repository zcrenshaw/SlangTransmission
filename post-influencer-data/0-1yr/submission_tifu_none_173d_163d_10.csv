"TIFU Update: I fucked up by not knowing the guy I like works on the same floor as me and telling my friend loudly that, ""he could fuck me in the ass.""


Link to OG post! https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/acyy54/tifu_by_not_knowing_that_the_guy_i_like_works_on/

Two months ago, I fucked up. I was infatuated with this super cute guy who came in and guess lectured for one of my classes. I ended up realizing, not in a way that I wanted to at all, that he actually works three labs down from the lab I work at. 

Basically, most of the floor was on holiday and my close friend and I were hanging around the hallway joking about my crush on this guy. I said, ""I would even let him fuck me in the ass if he wanted to..."" He overheard, came out and told me and my friend to be quiet, then winked at me. I was so fucking mortified. 

I didn't come back to to the lab until winter break was over, hoping that the large influx of people would somehow prevent me from every seeing him again. That didn't happen. On my first day back, I was in the break room making some toast when he walks in. ""Oh fuck,"" I had thought knowing that a confrontation was probably inevitable and that I ought to apologize for my crass comment. But instead, I frantically looked away and focused on putting peanut butter on my toast because if I do that, he can't see me right? That didn't happen again. Instead, he came up right next to me smiled, and said ""Hey [my name], how was your break?"" 

I looked up awkwardly and told him it was fine, mainly just stayed on campus and worked at the lab. He told me that he basically did the same but went to see him family for a couple of days. He didn't bring up what happened either thank god. Then he said something along the lines of, ""Is that all your having for lunch?"" and I was like, ""Uhm yeah, I was in a rush and forgot to pack something."" 

Then he said, ""Oh I was gonna go grab something to eat at [a sandwich place near us], do you wanna come with?"" 

I was like what the fuck, that smooth fucker. I tried not reading into it and brushed if off as him being nice so I said sure and we went. 

Well. We ended up having a great lunch. Inevitably as we were on our way back, he finally made a crack and was like, ""So tell me, after our lunch today, how many seconds do you think I spent staring at you?"" I literally just looked at him blankly with my jaw dropped before he chucked out, ""It has to be longer than six seconds at a time right? That has to mean I like you."" (Btw what he said was a reference to what me and my friend are talking about that day when he overheard). 

Even with my shock, I managed to laugh and make a wise crack back at him. He asked me out to dinner the next day. 

Tomorrow is our one month anniversary! We have not done the butt stuff. He told me after a couple weeks that although he appreciated my comment, he's not into putting his dick in buttholes. Looks like I will be retaining my butt virginity and I managed to get a super cute, intelligent, and kind boyfriend out of this whole ordeal.

TL;DR: Despite my fuck up, it all worked out. We're celebrating one month together tomorrow!"
"TIFU by thinking divorce was an April Fools Gag


Let me preface this off by blaming all of you, the entirety of reddit for desensitizing me, and giving me major trust issues on April fools day.

So here it goes... Yesterday I got a group text from my wifes (sarah) side of the family stating there was an emergency family meeting happening that night over dinner at my mother in laws (Barb) house. 

I immediately had april fools spidey senses starting to tingle, but we haven't all got together since Christmas so I overlooked it and said we (my wife and I ) were in. 

We were the last to arrive and it was pretty somber when we walked in. We all sat down at the table and my wifes brother (Tim) informed the family that his wife (Ashley)  has been having an affair and they are divorcing. The affair was with a long time close family friend (Chris) who lived a block away.


Chris' wife (jen) had caught them when she came home early one day last week and broke the news to my brother in law Tim. 

Both families have been friends for years. They live less than a block from each other, they each have been married for 15+ years, have 4 kids right around the same age. Honestly, I have always thought both of them were picture perfect families. Hell, all four of them and their kids were at our house two weeks ago for a bbq. 

Anyways after airing a lot of dirty laundry, and their plans to divorce, how it could effect future family functions, and opening it up to the group of any questions... there was silence. 

I broke the silence with laughter and a slow clap. Saying this was the best april fools gag I've ever seen but I wasn't falling for it. I told Ashley and especially Tim they need to consider going into theater, their performances were top notch and tears seemed genuine. 

Being the newest member of the family (my wife and I married 6 months ago) this was probably not the best thing to say in hindsight. I probably should not have said anything. 

Everyone in the room looked horrified. 

My mother in law, who had been crying the entire time, lost all composure. She left the room in hysterics and did not return before we left. 

Tim, just shook his head, and his cheating wife actually let out a brief chuckle before calling me out for being a dumbass for thinking this was a ruse. Then berating me for being so insensitive. 


The rest of the family sat in silence shaking their heads as my wife berated me for trying to make a joke out of a serious situation...


I am still dumbfounded. In hindsight, I probably should have sat in silence... but I honestly still feel like I was calling out an april fools gag. 


#tldr

My borther in law's wife has been cheating on him. They told the family they are getting divorced. I broke the awkward silence with a slow clap and laughter saying I'm no april fool.

"TIFU by destroying the entirety of my family for only $99


Throwaway account.

We've all been seeing the recent craze of DNA testing and whatnot, so my dad and I decided to jump in the bandwagon and we bought 2 from 23andme. We got our results back a few days ago and I went into the DNA relatives section to check out my matches. At the top it listed my dad as only sharing 29.2% DNA with me and being predicted to be a half-brother, which is impossible. This didn't make sense to me since we also shared a paternal haplogroup and we just look so alike, so he was definitely my father. My cousin also had taken the test a while back and she shared 24.6% with me, also predicted to be my half-sibling. We're supposed to share around 12%, being 1st cousins.

I couldn't think of a genetic relationship that would explain what I was seeing and I had doubts in the accuracy of the percentages, so I made [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/23andme/comments/b6mz22/are_my_shared_percentages_wrongaccurate/) on r/23andme, asking for help. Basically, the shared percentages are extremely accurate and highly unlikely to be false. The only realistic explanation for what I was seeing was that my uncle, my cousin's father and my dad's brother, is my father. Reality hit me in the face like a flying bag of bricks. All the dots lined up and I felt a sense of *loss*. I sat in my room for an hour just in shock and then I had a feeling of anger come over me. I needed some fucking answers. 

Without even thinking, I rushed out of my room and confronted my mother downstairs. My mom is a business women and is often away on business trips. She had no idea my dad and I had done one of these tests since she was away on a trip and just got back. My mother and I never had a 'traditional' relationship. She was always focused on her work and my dad ended up mostly raising me. 

My irrational self didn't even sugar coat it. I asked her if she cheated on dad with Uncle David (name changed for obv reasons). I have never seen the color drain from someone's face so quickly. She looked dumbfounded and then mumbled ""What kind of question is this? Of course not."" I told her everything; the test, percentages, DNA matches, ALL OF IT!! Shit had just hit the fan. My mom fell to the ground crying, begging me not to tell dad. 

I left her there and went back into my room. I called my cousin (now half sibling) and told her everything. She ended the call screaming. Dad (now uncle) then came home and stumbled into my room asking what's wrong with mom. I told him everything too. He didn't say anything after calming down. He left the room and I locked the door. 

The for the next few hours, I heard my entire family fall apart outside my door. My parents got into a heated argument and my grandparents rushed over to see what was going on. My aunt in law and David showed up shortly later and I'm pretty sure I heard my Dad and David get into some physical fight. Utter chaos. 

I feel like fucking shit. Ik it's not my fault but I can't help feeling that this is all because of me. If I had spent my fucking birthday money on something else, none of this would have happened, but another part of me is glad to know the truth. I'm too scared to go outside. I don't even know what the outcome was. The only noise I hear in the house now is the occasional sobbing coming from my mother, and I sure my dad out of the house. Fuck my life

TLDR; Mom and uncle, both having spouses of their own, fucked, made me, and proceed to not tell anyone. I take a DNA test 19 year later and it all comes crashing down. I've locked myself in my room and I'm pretty sure my family has ceased to exist outside

"TIFU by making my wife think I killed myself


Right off the bat I want to say that I am in no way shape or form making light of suicide. This was not a prank gone wrong, or something I did on purpose, but rather a very unfortunate series of usually perfectly benign activities that led to me accidentally terrifying and mortifying my wife. Burner for reasons.

&amp;#x200B;

This happened a couple of weeks ago. I tripped and sprained my ankle. It's been bothering me enough that I've been taking Epsom salt baths in the evenings after work. In addition to helping with the sprain and swelling, I also find it incredibly relaxing. Say what you want about a grown man taking a bath, I enjoy a good soak.

&amp;#x200B;

I also deal with a condition called angiokeratoma. It's basically blood vessels that have expanded and cause a few small, (albeit slightly unsightly) dark spots a rather sensitive area...I call them old man spots. They're harmless, and most of the time I don't even notice, BUT every once in a while...I'll irritate one of these small bumps and it bleeds like a sonofabitch. Additionally it takes FOREVERRR to get the bleeding to stop...its not like I can elevate my balls, Let alone put a band aid on...

&amp;#x200B;

Well...on the day in question, I get a text from my wife that she's going to be working late. So, I get home and decide to soak my ankle/enjoy a little peace and quiet. It's not really important how I did it, but I ended up nicking one of those spots. So, after cursing a reasonable amount, I start the lengthy ritual of holding TP against it and checking every so often to see if it's stopped. Even after the bleeding stops I have to be very careful for the next few minutes to not get it started again, almost like scratching off a very fresh scab...Well I finally get it stopped and a short time later, proceed with my bath. I put on my headphones, closed my eyes and relaxed...

&amp;#x200B;

 I wasn't asleep but I was really zoned out and relaxed...until I was snapped out of it by my wife screaming in absolute terror. I've never ever ever heard her, or anyone scream like that. It scared the shit out of me, and I jolted awake nearly flew out of the tub. I shouted ""HONEY? WHAT THE FUCK!""  She didn't answer me, she was in a heap on the floor bawling.  It took me a second to figure out what the hell was going on before shouting ""Jesus Christ!"".....I could see what it must look like to her... I had apparently NOT stopped the bleeding as well as I thought I had....and my wife walked in on me eyes closed, slouched over in bathtub full of very bloody water.

&amp;#x200B;

It took me a long time to calm her down, and I don't think that's something you just get over. Hopefully one day we can laugh about it, but it won't be any time soon.

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR - nicked my nuts, didn't stop the bleeding completely even though I thought I had. Took a bath, zoned out. Wife walked in on me oblivious to the fact I was bleeding into the water and thought that I had killed myself. Sorry honey.

"TIFU by thinking I had a family history of glaucoma after finding my dad's weed 17 years ago


tldr at the bottom

17 years ago I passed my driver's test and wanted to take the family car out on my own. Being a huge nerd I checked the glove compartment for the insurance and registration info which is when I found a baggie full of weed and a small wooden pipe. I just kinda sat there for a minute, grabbed it and went back in the house and found my dad. I handed it to him, said I didn't care who it belonged to but if I ever got pulled over, the cops probably weren't going to believe the 16 year old girl that it wasn't hers. He just put the stuff in his pocket, kinda shrugged and said, ""it's your mom's for her glaucoma"". Whatever, fine, just don't keep it in the car anymore.

&amp;#x200B;

I was at a family a dinner awhile ago and I can't remember what someone said but I replied with, ""yeah, because mom has glaucoma"" and my mom goes, ""I don't have glaucoma"" and I, incredulously, said ""dad said you had glaucoma"", in which my dad responds to with, ""what the hell are you talking about, I never said that"". After reminding him of said driving incident over a decade ago he just looks at me and burst out laughing, said he had no memory of that at all and couldn't believe I believed his off the cuff lie about my mom having a degenerative eye disease. I told them I had been writing down family history of glaucoma at every doctor and eye visit I'd been on for the past like 15 years. They just laughed harder.

&amp;#x200B;

tldr: I found my parent's weed stash when I was 16, they told me it was for glaucoma, I believed them for almost 2 decades. "
"TIFU by glueing my ass shut


This happened about an hour ago. As a man, I have hair that grows in places I didn’t even know hair could grow and sometimes it’s hard to shave and such. I have heard about waxing before but it seemed like more of a commitment than I cared for and it was out of the way.

This is where I really went wrong. I ordered wax strips off Wish, that Chinese marketplace app. I figured it’s only $2 what’s the worst that can happen. Oh did I learn.

I whipped one of these bad Larry’s out and decided to just go for it. The wax didn’t need to be heated, it was already sticky and I assumed you just needed to apply, wait a few seconds and rip. These didn’t come with any instructions so it really is just a guessing game. After applying the strip to my rear, I ripped it off and saw no hair. I tried again, same result but wax was missing. The wax was coming off the strip and sticking to my ass, which has held my cheeks together like a zipper.

Going to take a long shower and burn my ass off.

TL;DR Tried to wax my butt hair, used a cheap wax strip and it stuck my cheeks together. Hoping a long shower removes the wax from my butt.

"TIFU (NSFW) by forgetting that my boyfriend creampied me last night and going to my gynecologist's appointment.


Before everyone freaks out - yes, I am on birth control. Also, apologies on format because of mobile blah blah.

This happened 30 minutes ago. I'm currently sitting in my car outside my gynecologist's office typing this.

My boyfriend and I both lead pretty busy lives. He works full time and often works overnight shifts. On the other hand, I'm a full time student that works 30-35 hours a week. On top of that, I had to put down my beloved fur child last Saturday, so as expected, he hasn't really been putting his wand in my Chamber of Secrets..if you catch my drift.

After an emotionally draining week, filled with lots tears and interspersed with sexual frustration, we finally had some time last night to, in Conan O'Brien's words, ""take grandma to Applebee's."" It's been a while since we had sex and my bf is not a fan of hand to gland combat, so unsurprisingly, he had a huge load.. As in, I felt his dick spasms as he shot ropes of jizz in me. When I was cleaning myself up after, I noticed just how much was coming out of me and when I told him he laughs it off and says,"" Haha, yeah, that was a lot.""

Anyways, this morning I check my calendar and of course I have a gyno appointment. I'm the type of person that gets really anxious for any type of appointment and while psyching myself out for my handsome and young male gyno to take a peek at my vagooba, I completely forget about last nights sexscapade. 

Fast forward to the appointment and everything seems normal. I guess my gyno was training a Physician's Assistant because she was the one that did my pap smear. 

For the dudes reading this, a pap smear is when us ladies have to channel our inner Sasha Grey and lay on our backs with our legs spread wide open for our gynecologists' viewing pleasure. They then stick a speculum in, open up our love canals, and blindly stick a bristle-like swab in to take cultures. Ya know, nothing's better than having a complete stranger stick random objects up your terrified hooha while they try to hold a conversation with you - always a good time.

Anyways, as she sticks the speculum in, her soft virgin eyes look mortified. My experienced gyno just carries on, asking me questions. Midway he stops, looks, smirks, and goes,"" Do you finally have a bf?"" (It's worth noting that he's a really cool gyno and obviously, I must talk to him about my sex life every check up). I awkwardly answer ""yes"" and he gives me his spiel about continuing my birth control/being careful. The new PA still looks semi-disgusted but has finished and is now pulling out the speculum. That's the EXACT moment that my soul leaves my body. As she pulls it out to throw in the trash behind her, I see my boyfriend's freaking baby batter DRIPPING off this thing into the floor. Once the speculum was removed, I proceed to feel a gush of liquid rush out of my pink canoe and pool around my butt. Yes, I was still spread eagle and you can bet that they both saw. 

The poor PA looks at my gyno and asks,"" Did you want me to clean that?,"" referring to what dripped on the floor. Before he could answer, I made a strange ass sound and rushed out,"" It's okay, I'll do it.""

Before they leave, my gynecologist winks at me and says,"" Guess your dry spell is finally over!"" We speak casually like friends so I'm not weirded out or anything but so embarrassed.

Guys.. I am seriously fucking horrified. What the fuck. I'm seriously considering switching gyno's but mine is so damn good at his job and we really get along. 

Also, not using a throwaway because I have no shame.

TL;DR: Boyfriend blew a huge load in me last night, went to the gynecologist today, and his cum literally gushes out of me."
"TIFU by letting my nephew use my deceased brother cell phone


This happened yesterday. My brother passed away in an accident a few months ago, he was only 35. Needless to say, it was - and still is - a huge trauma to all of us. My 6 years old nephew wanted to play a game in my brother´s (his father) phone, sister-in-law was ok with it, so I let him. All of the sudden, I hear him doing a monologue... went to check up on him. He was clicking on family member´s pictures and making calls. A few moments later, people started to message me saying they almost had a heart attack. Some didn´t have the balls to answer... my sister had to leave a work meeting because she started to shake. They were scared. They were surprised. The best was people´s description of the moment they picked up the phone and saw my brother´s name on the screen, thinking he was calling from the beyond. We all had a good laugh.


TL;DR: Family freaked out thinking my deceased brother was calling them, instead it was my nephew using his phone.  "
"TIFU by telling the grocery store they needed to get rid of their new, loud, automated door greeter.


This happened last week. I was in a hurry to get to the grocery store pharmacy to pickup a prescription about 20 minutes before work. I pulled into the parking lot, walk through the door, and I hear in an automated, LOUD, voice, “THANK YOU FOR SHOPPING AT SAFEWAY!”  
Slightly startled by the unexpected greeting, I continue to the pharmacy at the back of the store. Multiple times I hear, “WELCOME TO SAFEWAY!” And “THANK YOU FOR CHOOSING YOUR LOCAL SAFEWAY.” And I think to myself how annoying this booming robo greeter was.    
After I pickup my script, I grab a couple other quick items and proceed to the U-Scan to check out and I am constantly hearing this booming robo-voice. After I finish at U-Scan and turn to leave I see a manager speaking to the U-Scan clerk and decide to take the opportunity to tell her, “You guys have got to get rid of that robot greeter. That THING is SOOOOOO annoying!”    
The manager looks at me like I’m A FUCKING MONSTER and says, “There is NO WAY we are getting rid of Sarah! She isn’t going ANYWHERE!” Confused and surprised I bit my tongue and gave her a look like like she’s crazy and go to leave. Running the confusion through my head as I walk. Then I go to leave and hear the robo greeter thanking me for shopping, and I look up. Turns out the robo-greeter Sarah is a human woman named Sarah with ALS or some kind of similar Hawking-esque catastrophic disability. She was using a computer tablet attached to her wheelchair to select greeting messaged for customers as they enter and leave. My stomach immediately SANK and my face turned red as I walked back out to my car in shock at my own assholery...

TL;DR I told the grocery store to fire their robo-greeter that was actually a severely disabled woman. "
"TIFU by detoxing myself and it nearly cost me my life


Obligatory this happened 2 weeks ago

&amp;#x200B;

I had been dieseling through a handle of cheap vodka every other day for over a year. I've never been much of a drinker, but several traumatic events had transpired in a very short amount of time, so I began drinking more to help me cope. I would never consider drinking during the day or before work, but it helped me get through the day. Mixed drinks slowly gave way to straight shots of vodka. I would wake up at 7 am, feed the cat and take several shots. This continued well into the evening until I passed out on the couch or my bed. I started working at a local department store and the schedule was perfect as I didn't have to be in till1pm so I could wake up early, take several shots and sleep on the couch till noon then get ready for work; taking a couple of swigs on my way out the door. I'd get home around 10 pm and drink until I passed out.

This past February is when the shakes started, usually near the end of my shift. I'd get home, have a few shots and everything would be fine. What was disturbing was my memory loss. I was repeating stories, unsure of what day is was and I even forgot to pick up my nephew from school. Dusk and Dawn were the worst, it took me a few minutes to figure out if was day or night. I knew something had to change. Two Saturdays ago I bought a handle in the afternoon and it was gone by Sunday evening. I woke up Monday morning feeling awful. I was shaking, queasy and terribly off balance, but I didn't drink. By the afternoon I was feeling better and I figured I would get through this. I went to visit my sister and was having a glass of wine and a cigarette out on her back porch when I began to vomit all over her back deck. It was then that the shakes returned with a vengeance.

I went home and crashed on the couch. I woke up around 5 am and spent 20 minutes dry-heaving in the bathroom. I tried drinking water, but my hands were shaking so bad that it took both of them to steady the glass. I went back to the couch and drifted in and out of sleep for the majority of the morning. Sometime after noon, I went to get my cat some water, but my hand began to convulse uncontrollably. I tried to steady it with my other hand, but I spilled water everywhere; that was the last thing I remembered. I was laying on my stomach on the living room floor when I noticed a Police Officer standing over me. I had no idea where I was or what had happened. I tried to get to my feet but collapsed onto the couch. My coffee table had been completely turned upside down and its contents were strewn all about the room. My mouth was in so much pain and I saw chunks of blood on the floor where I had been laying. The Officer helped me get my shoes and coat on and assisted me out into the hall.

There were 2 more Officers waiting outside and the helped me down the stairs to an ambulance. The paramedics were asking me questions, but I couldn't answer their questions. once in the Emergency Room, the Doctors and Nurses bombarded me with questions that I could barely answer. My main concern was the throbbing inside my mouth. One of the nurses explained to me that I had chewed off part of my tongue as that was one of the effects of having a seizure. I was admitted later in the evening and that was my sister and nephew came to see me. I could tell by the look in her eyes I was in very bad shape.

I was hooked up to several different machines with IV tubes in both arms and a blood pressure cuff that sat snuggly on my left bicep that inflated every 15 minutes; I was on the brink of complete coronary failure. Over the next 3 days and nights I was a prisoner to my bed. There were sensors that would trigger an alarm if my legs went to far over the bed, if I tried to sit up it would set them off as well. If had to pee, they brought me a plastic jug and I had piss in the bed with an audience. Every 30 minutes the blood pressure guff would inflate and take a reading followed by a nurse coming in and injecting medicine into my IVs. The worst part was I couldn't eat and barely drink because of the pain in my tongue. My speech was incomprehensible as my tongue was so swollen. Everyday my sister came to visit and told me she had gone to my apartment to check on my cat and make sure everything was locked up; she even cleaned up the chunks of tongue off the floor.

By Friday afternoon I was stable enough to go home, but with strict limitations. No driving, no strenuous tasks and lots of medication. This past Friday I finally started eating solid food again; after 2 weeks of pureed food it was like heaven to eat a chicken salad sandwich. Everyday I get a little stronger and feel a lot better. I still have trouble with my memory, but I think its good that I don't remember too much about the last year. I spoke to my neighbor; the one who called 911. He told me he had heard me fall and came banging on my door. When I didn't answer he went around to my back door and saw me laying on the floor. He said I looked at him and my face was covered in blood, that was when he called 911. I gave him a hug and he checks in on me daily. My tongue will never heal, but it's a small price to pay to remind me never do that again.

"TIFU Mishandling My Daughters First Period


I am divorced and have my two girls every other weekend. One Saturday morning, my oldest girl comes in to my room and she's on the speaker phone with her mom. I hear mom say wake him up and then I wake up and address my child.

""Daddy, I have my period"", she says. Me: Um ok. I get up. Get dressed and point at my 9 y/o and say you're in charge. I'll be right back. I go to the store and faced with a sea of pads, I pick up a box of pads and a chocolate bar. My neighborhood cashier asks me if I found everything ok. I say yes.

I return home and give my daughter the bag. She asks what the chocolate is for and I confidently reply - to make you happier. I leave her to her business assuming mom has groomed her in some way for this moment.

For backup, I call up a gf and told her about what was happening and she asked specifically what I bought for her. Depends undergarments and chocolate. I bought her elderly diapers. 



tl;dr My daughter has first period and I buy her elderly undergarments."
"TIFU by not checking my shorts before putting them on.


Background - My lady love (LL) and I live in a house built in the early 1900’s with mostly original everything, including the sliding no screen having windows.  We typically only crack the windows or put in temporary screens when fully open due to not wanting the cat to get out.  Further, while sleeping I’m typically in the buff unless we have visitors over - story time!

Talk about an amazing weekend... the northwest weather has been treating us well lately.  Saturday we went golfing, rode bikes to go eat and play some pinball, then basically enjoyed each other’s presence for the remainder of the day.  Sunday morning was starting off no different.  Looking forward to a quick walk and talk over some caffeine then commencing with our normal Costco run and likely some yard work, etc.

Time to get up!  After handling some normal morning routines I head to the bedroom while LL finishes her routine in the bathroom.  I try to respect the neighbors by putting on some clothes while walking around downstairs with the blinds open.  The first thing I see are my Adidas basketball shorts from the early years (these things are over 15 years old and still going strong - love em!).  I pick them up, put them on, then hop on the bed and decide to take a tour of reddit.... Here we go.....

Not 10 seconds later I feel that initial sensation you get when an itch creeps up, but on the base of the head of my dick.  (This all feels like slow motion)  I reach down to itch it and from the time I start moving my hand to the time I reached my dick the feeling went from itch to fire..  so instead of itching I pulled my dick out to observe for any visual signs of concern.  I didn’t really see anything... THE PAIN IS INCREASING!!

At this point I throw my shorts off and as soon they hit the ground I hear “BZZZZZZZZZZZZZBBZBZZ”.   

Me: “BABE!!!!”  

LL runs in asking what’s wrong. 

Me:  “I think a bee or wasp stung my dick!”

LL:  “WTH do you mean a bee or wasp stung your dick!?!”

I pointed at the buzzing shorts.  After regaining a bit of my composure I hammer fisted the shorts and confirmed that yes, yes in-fact a wasp was in my shorts and stung my dick.  

Let me say one thing, I consider myself a fairly intelligent person but LL out does me here and in many other areas.. it’s one of the main reasons I adore this lady.  Either way, aside from being a smarty pants LL doesn’t handle high stress situations very well.  At this point my eyes are bugged out and she can tell I’m a bit concerned about my dick.  She grabs her phone and googles “wasp sting dick”.  Really.... anyways, she ends up finding stories about other people’s dick’s getting stung and is laughing... she’s lost god damn site of the mission.  

Me:  “Babe.... maybe just look up wasp sting treatment”

LL:  “ohhhhhh yeahhhhhhh - sorry”

Wasp Treatment - Clean with soap, treat with vinegar for 15 min, and then ice.

Cleaning with soap - check!  LL brings me a glass of white wine vinegar....

LL: “to soak your dick....”

I have to walk into the office and close the door because I’m so damn embarrassed that I’m soaking my dick in a good drinking cup full of vinegar.  15 minutes pass and I go shower.  Pain is all but gone and there is no swelling.

As I sit here typing this up I can still smell the vinegar on my finger and can only imagine how bad my dick smells.  This little bastard isn’t going to ruin my day; I have his corpse in a sandwich baggy and he will be going with us to Costco and our other adventures.  This is just in case my dick swells to the size of a grapefruit or something.  

Well, thanks for listening and don’t forget to check your shorts!

TL;DR - Put my shorts on without checking and got my dick stung by a wasp."
"TIFU by eating lunch in a JCPenny parking lot.


I know, its ridiculous, so let me explain. This happened about a month ago, but after seeing everyone elses stories on here, I've finally decided to share this glorious collection of events, and man, thinking back now, I die a little bit inside. Its a bit of a read, but you're gonna need a **lot** of context.

&amp;#x200B;

So currently I'm going to a community college (going on my second semester) and everythings just fine and dandy, I'm getting my anxiety under control from the purgatory that was high school, and I'm just starting to feel better about myself over all. My first semester went fantastic, although I was a little late in signing up for my second semester classes, so I had to essentially pick up scraps for my schedule. One of my classes goes from 7 to 9 PM (which I somewhat regret, although my professor is super understanding and wholesome, so I can't really complain). Typically I always get super hungry right after it, and luckily there's a plethora of food joints around that area, so I typically choose whichever one im feeling, and usually eat in a parking lot (mostly to be able to watch things like YouTube or Netflix while I eat, and so I don't bother anyone in doing so), usually, its at the JCPenny.  I usually always park at the halfway point of the whole lot, then I kick my seat back, put my phone on my dashboard, and munch down. Pretty harmless right? Thats what I thought too, until it happened.

&amp;#x200B;

One night I'm just munching down some Popeyes chicken watching OneyPlays or something along those lines on youtube, just being pretty carefree, although (because **a n x i e t y)** a little bit paranoid, worrying about things like, ""What if someone notices me and thinks this is weird? Could I get mugged easily?"" (things like that.) I usually brush it off though, when outta the corner of my rearview mirror I see a black car park a ways behind me, shut its lights off, and no-one gets out. At first I told myself I was overreacting, and just continued to watch my phone. Then I notice another 2 black cars park on my left, and on my right, and do the same as the 1st car. Now, I start **w o r r y i n'.** I try to not look at them while I turn the car on and drive off, and at first I though I should just go home at that point, but my fatass hasn't finished eating, and not to mention I don't want to be followed all the way home, so I just park on the other side of the JCP in between a spot with some big ass bushes, hiding myself pretty well. Not even 15 seconds pass, when I see flashing lights, and the words ""Come out with your hands up."" being yelled out. At that point I'm just shaking (I've never gotten a ticket before, very much less arrested)  and essentially throw myself out of the car to my knees, while 2 cops run over and cuff me. Then they proceed to say, ""You ain't gonna be bothering (made up name of course) Kat anymore for a long time Jonny."" to which I can barely squeak out to say, ""W-whos Jonny? My name's A-Anon."" To which they pause for one of them to say, ""So, you're not Jonny \*Lastname\*?"" I shake my head, while the second guy digs out my wallet from my pocket and sees my Drivers License and goes, ""Hey man, I think we got the wrong guy, lemme check this out."" Cop 1 leads me to sit on the Police car's hood while Cop 2 looks though my driving record (no accidents or anything at all, thank you very much). 

&amp;#x200B;

As this whole event processes, a skinny, blonde girl comes out from the store and starts going **o f f** on me while walking towards us, some examples of things that were said (in a very, how would I say, ghetto tone) were, ""Fuck you Jonny! You knew what would happen if you kept looking for me, you're NEVER, EVER going to see you're daughter again! She deserves better than your crackhead ass!"" As I'm in complete and utter confusion, Cop 2 comes out and ties to calm this girl (who I assume was ""Kat"") down, while Cop 1 starts uncuffing me. As she gets closer, she starts to see that I'm not who she thinks she is, and starts breaking down. **Apparently**, this girls ex boyfriend was super abusive, used meth, and was just an asshat overall, and would stalk her wherever she would leave him, but would ultimately go back to him (its sad really). So when she got pregnant, she went on to put out a restraining order, and got her own place. Now, the reason for the confusion was that this Jonny guy has the same car as me, and even had the same hula girl I have on my dashboard (what are the damn odds right?) to which Kat started noticing my car being parked, **somehow, for some magical reason,** next to hers. Another reason she got scared (because **bullshit luck and the universe hates me being happy and content with my mediocre life)** she saw me get out of my car (to get something out of my backpack from my trunk) and saw that I wore a jacket that was similar to Jonnys favorite jacket. (**Fuck. Me. Right?**) So, because paranoia (which I don't really blame her for) she called the cops over to check it out, but I was gone by the time they arrived. So they start parking there every night till they started noticing a pattern of my model of car being parked in that area, which was, every Monday night (which is when I have my night class.) Now, because of the lack of info they had (things like a license plate number and things of that sort, cause **fucking Jonny** apparently **also** had a pretty big record of petty theft, drug dealing, and Jumping license plates, which was just **fucking peachy keen for me**) I guess the cops tried to just zero in on my car and plan an ambush. 



Obviously, the cops and poor Kat apologized to me for a good 10 minutes, until I was able to just process this sheit-show. Cop 2 asked me if I wanted to press charges for false allegations, but of course I wasn't, Poor girl just wants to protect her baby, I can't get mad for that (I can get mad easily cause I got my mom and dads combined short fuses, but I ain't a monster) Ultimately I just smiled nervously, agreed this was all one big mis-understanding, and we should just leave it at that. I gave Kat a quick hug (because I'm a mess whenever I hear about a person being in a shitty situation trying to protect their kid, or just around people being sad in general, I also got a big soft spot for babies, they just make me all ""motherly"" for lack of better terms, I'm also a chubby Mexican dude that's got the facial expressions of a turtle, so that really tells you a lot about me.) The officers shake my hand with beet red expressions, and we all say our goodbyes and go our separate ways. About a week later, a check for about 100 bucks comes for me in the mail from the city, which was of course from the cop guys, and from time to time I see Kat whenever I go shop JCP, just to check up on her (cause at that point, you're essentially acquaintances after that whole event that unfolded, she's doing great by the way, her daughter just turned 1 about 4 days ago, super cute uwu). She's super nice too, even though I don't eat at that parking lot anymore.

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR , I was mistaken for an abusive boyfriend because we have the same car, I just wanted to eat my chicken tendies in the parking lot in peace. Also, fuck you Jonny, leave Kat alone you 10 piece chicken McBitch."
"TIFU By thinking my new headset was broken for 6 months.


I bought a new razer kraken headset about 6-7 months ago, and at the time I didn't realise that there was a volume wheel. So I started to use it when I realised that it felt so quiet, so I unplugged them and put my shitty sony headphones back in. 

A couple of days later I plugged the headphones back in, to see if anything had changed, nothing. So I searched it up on the razer forums, there were fixes but nothing worked. So I tried to use it in game when I bent over to get a can of coke of the ground, when I accidentally turned up the volume wheel, not knowing I had done this, I thought it was awesome. But about an hour later, somehow I accidentally turned it back down, and I thought it had broken itself again.

Skip ahead six months or so, and I plug them in again because why not, and I realise there's a volume wheel. I turn it up, working. Good as new. And I spent the rest of the day feeling like the biggest idiot.

TL;DR Bought a new headset, didn't realise there was a volume wheel. Thought the headset was broken because the volume wheel was turned all the way down. Six months later, I realise the problem and feel like an idiot.

"TIFU by accidentally complimenting a patients penis


This happened yesterday and Im still horrified and laughing about it. Im an ultrasound tech. I had a patient come in for an ultrasound because he has some swelling in one of his testicles. The normal procedure is I leave the room, he takes off his pants and underwear and lays on the exam table and covers up with a sheet. I come back in the room and place a towel over his groin while pulling down the sheet. He remains covered. I place another towel over his legs below the testicles. This keeps only the testicles exposed during the procedure. 


Everything good so far. The scan involves checking each testicle as well as the surrounding area. For the most part this is just place and, get image, repeat. As Im working, I can see he is slightly uncomfortable and keeps moving. It's not uncommon for men to get an erection. Typically I ignore it but this guy is shifting enough that Im not able to get images. I say ""Don't worry about it. It's normal but I need you to hold still.""


He settles down and I continue. The towel is bulging enough that I can tell he still has the erection. I need images of the urethra so I am checking his shaft also. Yep still hard. OK so this guy is hot! I have an attractive man laying on the table with no pants and an erection covered by nothing more than a bulging towel while my hand is rubbing a wand along the length of his erection. No big deal Im a professional. I finish and start to put the machine away but between his moving and my nervousness I don't realize that the cord is under the edge of the towel. The towel starts to slide off as I pull so I reach down to stop it. Im reaching between the bed and the ultrasound machine and lose my balance. I have a hold of the towel as I start to fall and rip it off. A blob of what I hope is lube from the ultrasound catapults up and hits me in the face as Im bent over. Not thinking, I use the towel that is already in my hand to wipe myself off. As Im wiping my face on this guy's loin cloth I get a good view of him. After a moment I realize that Im just staring at his extremely large and very erect penis. He is completely exposed but afraid to cover himself because I already got onto him for moving earlier. I start to apologize. I meant to say something along the lines of ""oh my God Im so sorry"". Instead what comes out is ""wow impressive"". I mentioned Im professional right?


I lay the towel back over him, fumble to put the machine away and tell him to get dressed and open the door when he is done. He tries to tell me it's no big deal when he was leaving but I was so embarrassed that I couldn't even make eye contact.


TL;DR I saw a patients penis and rather than apologize I told him it was impressive."
"TIFU by not accepting my girlfriend's proposition


This happened almost 17 years ago, and my girlfriend, now lovely wife still teases me about it to date.

I was 21 years old, and just moved away from home from Oregon up to Canada. My buddies and I just finished moving me into my new apartment, after a week of doing so. They were tired so they decided to start their grand trek home back to the US. Myself on the other hand, had nothing but time. I decided to try my luck to make friends or try to bring a girl home for the night. So I went to a bar (Woody's, Coquitlam, BC, Canada) and decided to enjoy the first day in my new city. Left early because there was a Hockey game on and I wanted to watch it. 2 hours later I sit down enjoy a couple of beers with some guys at the bar and I begin to leave, when I was stopped by a young woman at one of the booths. With tears in her eyes, she asked me if she could talk to me I said of course (being the nice guy that I am), and she told me what was up. Her boyfriend was apparently just using her for sex and she was left for a younger, ""more attractive"" woman. I said to her, "" I just moved here, and I'd love it if you could show me around."" She glowed at my proposition and we called it a date. She took me to to the movies, and I took her to her favourite restaurant. We ordered wine and we got a Lamb Dinner for Two. After a few bottles of wine and tons of great stories I she invited me back to her place, I was nervous, but I kept my cool. When we stepped in she said that she had to ""get ready"". I waited for a while, and she came out 15-20 minutes later, in very revealing lingerie. She said sorry for the wait, she was cleaning her room and I said all good.

Now here's the kicker. I have slight social anxiety, but even then, I don't think it'll ever be that bad ever again.

I could feel my heart racing, beating faster and faster with each beat making me more nervous. Then it happened. She was too beautiful for me. My raging erection got the best of me and I chickened out. She asked what was up, and I instinctively responded, ""I'm just not in the mood, trying not to hurt her feelings. We eventually cuddled up on the couch and we watched some TV. I slept the night, and woke up to her shaking me. She said, ""You know, I could have helped with that, right?"" I was confused, then she pointed at my briefs and there was a MASSIVE stain, right around the junk. I was so embarrassed that my face was (apparently) as red as a tomato. She laughed, and I did too. Now that woman is my loving wife and she if forcing me to post this. 




Oh god please help.


Just kidding :)



TL;DR:

My girlfriend, now wife, showed me around my new town, took me to her favorite places, and took me back to her apartment. I chickened out and had a wet dream during the night.

"TIFU by doing a strip dance for my wife.... with my mother in law watching


(Happened last night). My wife and I have a really playful &amp; sarcastic relationship, and we love to mess with each other in just about any situation. My wife had been on face time with her mom for a while, and so I decided to try to get her to crack by doing a stupid strip dance. I was on the other side of the camera, so *in my mind* only my wife could see the true glory. It definitely got NSFW pretty quick and then I heard my mother in law say ""OMG put your clothes on!""

Wife was sitting next to a window, turned out my reflection was positioned perfectly so my mother-in-law saw the whole thing. Of course I didn't notice the reflection and my wife wasn't paying attention to her face cam to warn me.

Thank god my mother in law is cool- cuz the next thing she said was ""well, I guess you guys have some business to take care of. Have a good night, love you both!""

TL;DR- My MIL saw my ass last night"
"TIFU by not doing my sports bra up properly


Every Monday evening after work I go to an aerobics class which involves a LOT of jumping around. This week I was in a hurry and I had to get a lift because my car is in the garage and my mum was shouting me to get in the car as I'm getting dressed. 

I put on my sports bra which is zip at the front and has a few clips on the inside as well but because my mum was rushing me I skipped the clips thinking it will be fine. Spoiler alert - it wasn't fine. 

So mid way through my aerobics class I feel a PING and my damn sports bra has burst open, tiddies waving around for all to see. Now my boobs aren't small, we're talking DD, I was MORTIFIED. Ran to the toilet to do my bra back up, can't imagine going back to that class now.

TLDR; Didn't do my sports bra up properly, it pinged open and everyone saw my boobs,"
"TIFU by looking at a woman's ankles


No, this was not in the Victorian Era. It happened a few minutes ago.

&amp;#x200B;

Let me preface this by saying it has been a long day and my brain is malfunctioning a bit.

&amp;#x200B;

Anyway, I was walking down the street on my lunch break when I saw a woman wearing really cool shoes. After months of boots, it's nice to see some cool sandals, amirite?  I also noticed, by looking at her ankles, that she had really nice milky white skin. I'm trying a new thing where I attempt to compliment one person every day (because I'm an introvert with mental health issues, and the internet says this will help). So, I decided this was my moment. But I thought complimenting someone's skin would sound weird, so I figured I'd stick with telling her that her shoes were nice.

&amp;#x200B;

I quickly psyched myself up to speak to a stranger, going against all the advice I'd gotten in kindergarten. I was totally ready. I was gonna do it.

&amp;#x200B;

However, as she passed me, my brain apparently misfired, and I said, ""Hey, I like your ankles!""

&amp;#x200B;

She gave me a weird look and quickly walked away as I cringed. Oh well, at least now she has a good story about the crazy lady who complimented her ankles!

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR: Instead of saying I liked a woman's shoes, I said I liked her ankles."
"TIFU by trying to hallucinate


This story happened years ago, back when I was a weird 14 year old kid. 

I had always been interested in psychology and at the time came across articles about hallucinations, which resulted in a brief obsession with the topic. Eventually, I really wanted to experience hallucinations myself, of course without having to take drugs or doing anything harmful. 

So, I googled away. Goldmine: I found a step-by-step guide on how to induce hallucinations:

1. Cover each eye with half a ping pong ball

2. Make sure that the room is dark and have a red light in front of you to look into. 

3. Use noise canceling headphones and listen to static 

4. Wait around looking like a maniac and eventually (hopefully) hallucinate 



Naturally, this wasn’t something that I intended on doing with other people in the house. I patiently waited for an opportunity to be home alone and put my master plan into action:

I stole one of my brothers ping pong balls and cut it in half, took my mother’s infrared lamp and darkened out my room. Within a short amount of time, I was ready. 

Now, imagine a kid sitting completely still on a chair with ping pong balls glued over their eyes, wearing headphones and staring into an infrared lamp in complete darkness.  Yep - it’s as weird as it sounds. 

I cant put into words how excited I was to experience hallucinations first-hand and completely lost track of time. But alas! My waiting paid off, when I began to faintly hear footsteps, something that the guide explained was a common first auditory hallucination. My journey into a heightened state of mind was finally taking course! ... Or so I thought. 

Turns out that in the meantime, my parents and brother had come back home. My mom noticed the odd red light shining under my closed door and checked up on me, only to find me like... *that*. 

After getting over the initial shock, she called over the other family members to come take look at me, while I was sitting there blissfully unaware and pumped about finally ‘hallucinating’. Of course they didn’t pass up on the chance to take a couple of photos of me, before tapping  my shoulder and asking me *what the fuck* I was doing. 

You can imagine my horror when I realized that the tap on my shoulder wasn’t a hallucination, but real. 

The aftermath was that I had to buy my brother new ping pong balls and that I became the laughing stock of my family for a while, resulting in an embarrassing story that my parents still like to bring up occasionally. And of course, the pictures were shown around as well, causing immense embarrassment on my part. 

And arguably the saddest part of the story is that I never wound up hallucinating as I had originally planned. 

**TL;DR : I glued ping pong balls over my eyes, listened to static and sat in complete darkness while staring into res light in an attempt to hallucinate - got caught by my family and ended up completely embarrassed**"
