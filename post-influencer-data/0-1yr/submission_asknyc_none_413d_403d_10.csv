"Walking commuters, what percentage of your body was covered in sweat by the time you got to work this morning?


Personally I hit about 90% today, pretty proud of that and will now be walking to work in my birthday suit to avoid ruining dress clothes."
"Another ""unique"" NYC experiences post.


I browsed for a long time reading blogs (Atlas Obscura, Thrillist, etc) and using search on here. I’ve read the twenty or so “unique NYC” posts in the past year so I apologize if these have been answered before.

My best friend drives down from upstate and we meet up about three times a month to do an activity and dinner to catch up and have fun together. We opt-out of dining experiences because my friend is an extremely picky eater. We’re not into speakeasies or fancy drink places. Not a fan of amusement parks so Coney Island is out. We don’t like musicals or Broadway shows that much. 
He’s big into architecture, city planning, and trains. 

I’m saving the Transit museum for later because I want to surprise him with a tour of City Hall station when they schedule it for museum members for his birthday but I can't seem to find anything else that pops out in these subjects. 

So far we have done (mostly thanks to you guys):

Then She Fell
Sleep No More
Batsu
Spyscape
Drunk Shakespeare
Gotham Archery + knife throwing classes
Wrecking Club
Governor’s Island
30 Rock Studio Tour
One World Trade Center Observatory
Top of the Rock
Komnata Escape Rooms 
Gulliver’s Gate
Aire Spa 
Museum of the Moving Image
Getting drunk and playing pool and karaoke in K-town
The Slipper Room
The Evolution Store 
Other typical stuff (walk around Central Park, the High Line, Brooklyn Bridge, we went to see Jimmy Fallon and SNL already) 

I’ve got the Magician at the Nomad tickets for our next thing and then the Bloody Deed of 1857 later this month. 

I’m looking to see if any redditors have any experiences with (I find yelp and tripadvisor reviews to be unreliable in NYC, but this sub has never let me down):
Accomplice NYC
Museum Hack Tours 
House of Yes (there is some talk about it on here – I’ve read the best nights to go where a costume is mandatory, but I’m not seeing those nights scheduled anywhere on their website anymore) 

Outside of the annual festivals, etc – I’m running out of ideas and not finding anything new outside of online research on what to do. Of course everytime we hang out, it doesn’t have to be a spectacle where we HAVE to do something, but it’s been a pretty cool run. Any help would be extremely appreciated.

Thanks!

"What hotels have the best bath tubs?


Hi! I'm looking to celebrate my birthday in a hotel, preferably in Brooklyn or lower Manhattan, but tbh I'd be willing to venture to Staten Island, Queens, and easily accessible parts of New Jersey.

I live in Brooklyn. I just love hotels. I'm also a fat girl so my Brooklyn-sized bathtub either covers my tits or my knees, but not both. I wanna stretch out. I wanna  SOAK IN A DAMNED TUB. 

I'm also celebrating a couple of other things. I sold an editorial piece to a well-known publication. I just got over the heartbreak of being dumped by a guy who didn't even treat me well! I also very recently hooked up with an old flame for some casual fun times without any drama. I didn't get to do anything for my birthday months ago because of the aforementioned bad ex, so now it's time to treat the hell out myself.

I'd like to keep it around $200, but the cheaper the better. I'd go to $260 if I have access to a private balcony. 

I'm also super flexible on days. "
