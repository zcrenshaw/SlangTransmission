"When your nerdy hobby actually saves the day


I'm on a call with someone in another country, and my manager comes in brandishing a 3.5"" floppy disk.

I thought he was about to make fun of my retrocomputing hobby, as he does sometimes, so I ignored him at first - but then he said ""whoever it is, put them on hold"". This usually means a major issue, so I complied. 

""All robots in the factory are down,"" says $boss. ""Critical files needed to restore production are on this floppy disk. We are not aware of any backup medium.""

I take the disk and look it over. ""Last updated: 8/3/97,"" I muse. ""Just do what you can, and quickly!"" urges $boss.

Floppy drives were phased out in the business 7+ years ago, but there are two legacy servers still equipped with floppy drives. 

I skip down to the server room and try the disk in the first server. Open up Windows explorer... drive is not appearing. 

OK, let's not waste any time troubleshooting - we'll try the other one. It won't read the disk.

There are no USB floppy drives anywhere on campus (or if there are, they have excellent hiding spots).

As it happens, last Friday I had a retrocomputing meet to which I had taken my Win95 gaming rig (for a bit of multiplayer LAN goodness). And as it happens, it was still set up in my garage, so I screamed home, used the rig's drive to copy the contents of the floppy to the HDD, then zipped up the directory, FTPed the zip to my NAS and then emailed it via OWA on my home laptop directly to the guys responsible for getting it back up and running.  

Order is restored! 

I don't think I'll be catching crap about my hobby for a little while. 

**TL;DR:** Floppy contains critical files. Nobody has a PC with a floppy drive, except for the retrocomputing geek. Production resumes."
