"But I've been here for 20 years


Obligatory I'm on mobile

I'm a bank teller (not sure if this counts as retail but I couldn't find anywhere else to put it). My bank is a local bank that runs weird hours, such as drive through being open until 10pm Mon-Sat. The rest of the bank closes, along with the lobby. I was working tonight and had a guy come through the drive through asking me if I could cancel a check from his business account. I wasn't sure if I could, as I've only worked there for a couple months and no one has ever asked before, so I called my supervisor and she told me that's a job for bookkeeping. So I went to tell the guy. The conversation was as follows:

Me: ""Sir, I called my supervisor and I can't cancel the check. You'll have to come in on Tuesday and speak to bookkeeping.""

Guy: ""But I'm the owner of the account and I've been banking here for 20 years.""

Me: ""I'm sorry sir. I can't because I'm just a teller, but bookkeeping-""

Guy: *cutting me off* ""Ok great."" *drives away*

K...

I'll never understand why people think I can bend the rules because of how long they've had their account."
"Customer sh*t themselves


I no longer work at this job but I’m still scarred by this. The particular store sells basically everything besides food (not counting aisle chips and candy) but mostly clothes and it’s marketed towards lower income people who are able to buy name brand stuff at a super low price. But it’s a nationwide company so it’s pretty big and I know my particular store made around 60,000 a day.

So one day a few months ago this guy comes in, and we got homeless people and drug addicts all the time so this guy wasn’t out of he ordinary. Anyways I didn’t see this all go down but he went to try on some clothes in the fitting room and ended up sh*tting on the floor AND THEN USING THE FITTING ROOM CURTAIN TO WIPE HIS ASS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

This is definitely the worst thing that ever happened while I worked there, but we also had people leave used tampons/diapers in the fitting room too. People are so sick I’m so glad to have quit"
