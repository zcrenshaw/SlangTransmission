"[UPDATE] Me [31F] with my husband [35 M] married 2 years together for 10. He doesn't want his kids to be like me.


https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/2i34pr/me_31_f_with_my_husband_35_m_married_2_years/

It took me 3 more years, but I finally left him last year.

This post helped me see how much was wrong in our relationship, but I was still so hesitant to leave.

We had pets and a beautiful home together and I loved his family and we had so many inside jokes and plans for the future.

But eventually it was all just too much for me to take any longer. The day after his parents' 50th anniversary party, I told him I wanted a divorce. I just couldn't see myself living like that for 50 years.

I moved from the suburbs to the city with a friend. I rekindled some old friendships from high school and made a bunch of new friends who I am so thankful for. He kept the dog, I took the cats.

**I thought my life was ending but it was just beginning.**

I told my (very religious) family and they were all understanding and supportive. I've maintained friendships with a good number of our mutual friends, friendships I was worried about losing.

I'm working on my masters degree and volunteering and experiencing life and love and art and beauty like I never thought was possible.

I met a guy at a friend's punk rock show and we hit it off, but we are taking things very slowly. He is wonderful and so kind to me.

**If you are in an abusive relationship, please don't be afraid to leave.**

It gets so much better. I still miss him from time to time. I feel guilty about getting divorced, guilty for wasting my parents money on a failed marriage. I miss his parents. I miss my dog.

But I am SO MUCH happier. My future feels uncertain, but that is better than feeling like a death sentence.

Thank you so much to everyone who offered advice and sympathized and even had harsh words for me deciding to stay.

tl;dr: Left my abusive husband. Life is much better."
"I [69M] want to spend more quality time with my granddaughter [15F]. How can I bond with her?


For the past two weeks I have been driving and picking up my granddaughter from school. Her parents (my daughter and SIL) needed the help as their respective work places and her school are on opposite ends of the city and it would be extremely impractical for them so I offered. I have the time and I wanted to see my granddaughter a bit more often.

So now I drive her and pick her up and sometimes drive her to her after school activities. We hadn't spent so much regular time together in a long while and it feels very good to have her around a few hours a day.

She's been staying at our home a bit more. Does her homework there, her friends pick her up, etc., and I feel very good that my wife and I can dedicate some daily time to her. She's our only granddaughter and I feel like she shines our lives any time she's around.

She talks to me about memes I can't really say I understand, about school and some boy she's having some low key teenage drama with, soccer, mobile games. I don't really know how to connect with her about these things other than just ask questions so I'd like to maybe have some pointers on what I can actively do to bond and grow closer to her.

What are some things I can do with her to closer to her? It feels like raising my daughter again, but somehow a bit less intense and a lot more fun. I just want to enjoy time with her as much as possible.

What can I do?

**tl;dr:** I am suddenly spending more time with my granddaughter. How can I make the most out of it and enjoy what we do together as much as possible? What are some things I can actively do to grow closer?"
"[Update] (M33) ignores my overt physical boundaries (F32)


This sub has really changed my life.  I don't know how to express my gratitude, but hopefully this update will let you all know what you do here really matters.

When I started seeing M, I became obsessed with this subreddit.  I would read it several times a day.  Part of me knew what was happening wasn't right, but I felt like I needed outside perspective.  

My mother told me growing up to never speak ill of your partner.  So I lied to my friends and even my therapist about what was happening.  I thought it was wrong to say anything bad about M.  I only posted anonymously here.

I needed to read a lot of stories and hear a lot of comments before I understood relationships aren't supposed to be like what I had with M.  I would read a story and see dozens of commenters call a relationship abusive when that hadn't been my takeaway.  It made me realize I might not recognize what abuse is.

I started researching abuse and learned that name calling, threatening suicide, isolation from friends and family, and telling you no one else will ever love you are abusive behaviors.  I know some people will say that's obvious, but it was so much less abusive than what I saw growing up that I thought it was fine.

I opened up to my therapist and she confirmed that all of these behaviors I thought were acceptable were abuse.  I broke up with M.

It was terrifying to learn that I have literally no clue what a healthy relationship is.  But it probably saved my life.  I was with a man who CHOKED ME IN PUBLIC and I thought the problem was me.  I can't imagine what might have happened if I'd stayed.

My therapist and I are working on medicating my PTSD and exploring what healthy romantic relationships look like.  I'm having a hard time unpacking the abuse because I'm still learning what abuse is, but I'm talking openly and honestly.

Thank you, Reddit.

"[UPDATE] my (23f) bf (28m) checks out EVERY SINGLE WOMAN


[original post](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/b9aeqt/my_23f_bf_28m_checks_out_every_single_woman/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app)

Hi! So this wasn’t a terribly popular post but I just wanted to share the happy ending. 

The evening after I wrote this post, I went over to his house after work and we hung out and ate and stuff. While we were just laying on the bed, he faced me and said “baby, there anything I can do to be better for you?”. It was the perfect opportunity to share how I felt about that. So I just went ahead and said “idk if you know you still do this but you check out a lot of people when we’re out together. Mostly woman and I worry that it sexualises them and it makes me uncomfortable.” He seemed a little fake surprised and was like “really? Oh I didn’t know I did it so much and so obviously.” I didn’t want to push the agenda so much because I know he’s a thinker and will this about it even if we don’t discuss it further.

The next day, we were on our way back to his house and there was a girl walking towards us who was quite beautiful. I saw him glance at her then he turned and looked at me and I was already looking at him and we both burst into laughter. I said to him that I see that he’s struggling and we just laughed it off but he very clearly got the message because since then I haven’t seen any overt staring at both men and women.

Thank you to everyone who gave me to confidence to deal with this head on.

TLDR managed to speak to my bf about this issue and I’ve seen effort from him dealing with him"
"This girl (18F) at school asked me (18M) on a date and it went well, but her english is not the best and I cant understand what she says sometimes.


I met this girl earlier this year in February. She just moved from Italy and from my understanding grew up in a small village. The principal asked me to show her around when she brought her to class. We're in our final year of high school. I talked to her every now and then. There's a bit of a communication issue at times when I'm not sure what she's trying to say. Again I think it's because she grew up in a village that she never really learned English until a year ago. 

Last friday she came up to me with her cousin who speaks English. He was at this school long before she got here. She asked me out on a date and had her cousin there in case I got confused as to what she was saying. I said yes because she is pretty attractive. I enjoy her company when she's around. 

I didn't think of it and my friends are fucking useless. They can't hold a serious conversation especially when it comes to women. It's sex jokes over and over again. I tried to talk to them and it just went no where. 

I'm taking her to see Pet Cemetery and dinner tomorrow. It's the second date. I took her out on Sunday and she said he enjoyed herself.

I'm just a bit worried about annoying her if I can't understand what she's trying to say. I have no problem that she can't speak the language, but I just don't want to annoy her. 

**TL;DR: Going on second date with girl, but I struggle to understand her sometimes.**"
"(UPDATE) I wasn’t invited to my friend group’s annual trip for the first time in 8 years. I reached out to someone about it after getting advice here.


Hello! Here’s the original post 

https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/b7lug6/i_30f_wasnt_invited_to_a_yearly_trip_my_friends/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app

Some of you asked for an update, and I was given really solid advice so I figured I’d post.

I ended up texting with a friend, both of us reminiscing about good times. This conversation came up on it’s own and it felt reassuring to know that they wanted to reach out to me. I took this opportunity to tell them how I felt about the cabin trip that just happened and not being invited.

And you guys were right! The friend I was texting was surprised I didn’t know about it and felt sorry that I wasn’t able to attend, as they know how much I love everyone. They told me that I was missed and that I’m still a part of the group, and it wasn’t fair that I didn’t get the invite.  

Apparently, another mutual friend who always attends wasn’t invited either. The person coordinating Was just being forgetful, which I do understand because they have a lot going on and the two of us who weren’t invited live further away from everyone. 

Overall I’ve been reaching out a lot more this past week and feel more connected to everyone. A couple of us have even jokingly made a pact that we won’t ever exclude each other again.

I’m really glad I ended up texting someone. Thanks to everyone here who encouraged me to do so and to those who helped calm me down when I was feeling pretty bad. 

TLDR;

I wasn’t invited to our annual trip for the first time in 8 years. It made me feel all sorts of bad so I resorted to reddit for advice on how to handle things. Turns out no one knew I wasn’t invited, and I was actually missed! The coordinator just forgot about me because i live far away.

Everything turned out better than expected :)"
"Update from original post of my bf (24M) not wanting me (22F) to take antidepressants.


Here is a \*[link](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/89h4nt/my_22f_boyfriend_24m_is_very_against_me_taking/)\* to the original post.

&amp;#x200B;

It's been a year, ""Eli"" and I are both a year older now than before, imagine that.

&amp;#x200B;

I began taking my antidepressants a few months after the original post was made. I went through more therapy to be absolutely certain that I needed the medication. My therapist used the same multiple choice test on my feelings and symptoms twice (pre-test and post-test) to determine that nothing had changed/gotten better really over the course of 3 months or so. I began taking 10mg a day of an antidepressant and sensed a change fairly quickly. It took 3-4 weeks to fully kick in, but I think I started feeling it around 2 weeks. I am so much happier than before and I do not think about my life ending 3-5 times a week anymore. Now that I write that, I rarely think about it at all now. The things that used to seem like mountains are now just little mole hills. I cannot fully express how I wish I would have considered taking medication earlier. I feel like I wasted years of my life being so disgustingly unhappy.

&amp;#x200B;

Just earlier this week I broke up with Eli because I will be moving away for a job and I was no longer happy with the way the relationship was going. I still care about him immensely, and because I care about him so much I knew it was best to cut things off if I could not see the relationship progressing further after 3 years of dating.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm super excited to start a new chapter in my life!

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR; Took meds, broke up with boyfriend. Feeling insanely better! :) Thanks so much to all who originally commented and gave me advice! Or tough love! "
"My [21m] chronically ill, seemingly socially isolated cousin [20f] asked me to kiss her. I kinda feel bad for her and wish I could help her in any way. What can I do?


First off, I dont want to come off like feeling pity for her, just that she was handed a terrible hand in life and I feel compassion for her suffering.

She's chronically ill (respiratory and joint issues) and is currently studying long distance since she had a flare up and was bed ridden for a while. Before that she would actually go to class.

I visited her yesterday (she lives with her parents, I hadn't seen her in about 2 months, but we chat sometimes) and she was in bed, looking pretty ill. We talked and laughed for a while, then she said she has always had the most fun with me, held my hand and asked me if I would kiss her. 

I didn't know how to respond and asked her when she last kissed someone, she laughed and said it was a boy from high school when she was 18. Then there was a silence and she asked me again. I told her I wouldn't and she seemed very, very sad, and her voice choked a bit.

We kept talking for about an hour, we laughed with a few videos she showed me and I left. She gave me a very sad look when I left, from her bed.

That whole interaction really hit me in the feels. She used to be much healthier and active, and while her family really supports her, she just gets more and more ill. It hurts to think how deteriorated her mental health must be to ask me that sort of thing.

I wish I could help her be more healthy and happy. It hurts to see her so sad and isolated.

Is there anything I can do help her? Any way for me to lift her spirits in any way? How should I react if she ever asks me something similar?

**tl;dr:** Cousin is partially bed ridden from illness. She appears depressed, unmotivated and socially isolated. She asked me to kiss her and I refused, and she was visibly saddened. The whole interaction was sad and I wish I could help her in any way. Is there something I can do?"
"[UPDATE] My [29F] roommate's [24F] girlfriend [23F] moved in with us in January. She brought a dog we weren't expecting.


Original post: https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/axz3tz/my_29f_roommates_24f_girlfriend_23f_moved_in_with/

So I finally had enough. One Sunday a few weeks ago, my roommates left without warning while I had just settled in to get my homework done. The dog barked his head off for a good hour before I packed up my backpack and spent the rest of the day at Starbucks so I could concentrate. I called my mom and vented my frustration before cooling off and sending a well-thought out and vetted text message to let them know I was pretty upset about it, and that home has become a place of extra stress for me the last several months. I added that it isn't fair to the dog to be left so distraught all the time. The text was long, but rational, and I said that the dog needed to find a new home.

Fast forward three days when they finally decided to acknowledge me aside from little pleasantries in passing. They told me that the dog wasn't going anywhere, but that they would look into getting a dog sitter for the mornings they both left before I did. Ideal? Not really, but at that point I was ready to hear their options. It's only two days a week that he wakes me up before I need to be. They said it was a financial burden. Okay, I understand that... but having a special needs dog is a financial burden to begin with, and that should have been considered before even bringing him home in the first place.

Fast forward again almost a month to today. They have not found a dog sitter, and I'm not even sure they have even looked. With the end of the semester approaching, they know that my schedule will be changing very soon, and I'll likely be gone on the same days as my classmate, eliminating the mornings in which I'll be woken up by his barking. But now they've escaped taking any responsibility or showing any remorse for what a shit situation this is. On top of that, they have installed a nanny cam in the living room so that both of them can watch the dog and talk to him from their phones while they are away. I get the sentiment, but also I live in this house too. At any point while they are watching the dog, I could be spied upon also, and that's really discomforting. 

To top it off, I woke up this morning to his barking, and at this point I need to be up and moving anyway. They've started leaving pee pads out for him to use during the day while they're gone, and at 7 AM, mere minutes after everyone has left for the day, he's left a nice watery pile of shit on one of them and peed on the other. I don't want to clean these up, nor do I want to leave them in the house all day for my cat to traipse through or even eat (I hope to god that isn't a thing she does but who knows). This is not my responsibility, and now my home is going to smell like shit all day. And now that both pads are soiled, is he going to decide he won't use them anymore and eliminate on the floor? He's been having some bowel trouble lately, are people going to come home to diarrhea? I'm about to be gone from 9-6, so luckily someone will be home before me to find it, but the thought grosses me out. 

Anyway. I faced my fears of confrontation, only to be passively disrespected. At this point I'm looking at ways to get out of this lease and move out with another classmate in July, with the stipulation that we won't have dogs and any significant others can visit but won't be living with us. I'm completely at my wit's end. Still.

**TL;DR; : Calmly and politely confronted the roommates about the dog, they decided to do nothing.**"
"My brother (30s, m) is newly engaged after his wife died and I (20s, f) am having a hard time with his behavior.


Hi all!



My brother recently got engaged to a new woman (30sish, f) after his wife of 10 years died. This engagement comes three months after she lost her battle with cancer. I feel conflicted, as I know I have no place to tell him what to do with her interpersonal relationships. However, his callousness towards his deceased wife and his jumping into a new relationship right after her death is affecting how I feel towards him.  



There are a few sort of ""red flags"" in his behavior that bother me. He posted on facebook to announce his engagement. His former brother in law (deceased wife's brother) commented that it was just raw to see him move on so fast. My brother then wrote back ""She wasn't the wife or mother she wanted to be for the last 18 months."" The way he went about it seemed to be that it was easier to move on because she wasn't being attentive. She had cancer had been on her deathbed. 




Another point is that new fiance looks EXACTLY like old wife. In a weird way, it seems like they are just trying to replace the old wife. On the same facebook announcement, new fiance had responded to the brother in law that the kids needed a mother and she intended to fill that role. Maybe it's not my business, but replacing someones mother after her death seems rather callous. 




Overall, where I'm looking for advice and my main question is, am I overstepping? I haven't said anything to him about this, but it really is affecting how I feel about him. Obviously he must  be going through a lot as a dying spouse can't be easy, but it seems like he's moved past it and just wants to start a new life with his new replacement wife where his kids can have a new replacement mother.  





TL;DR: My brother got engaged 3 months after his first wife died, and his behavior afterwards has been affecting the way I see him. "
"I (29M) am no longer attracted to my wife's (32F) body, and I'm terrified it will destroy her if she finds out.


 

I first wanted to post this to AITA (amItheAsshole) because I feel like crap saying it, but I figured I might as well make a throwaway account and see if I can get some advice.

When we were first married, my wife was very proud of her body, and for good reason. A few kids later, and she hasn't been able to get back to her before birth weight and she can't get her belly flat thanks to one particularly humongous child and multiple c-sections. She hates it, and I see her look in the mirror with a depressed look every time she gets into the shower.

I still love my wife, and think she's amazing, fun to be with, great at helping me become a better man, etc. I just realized I'm not attracted to her body anymore and I don't want her to find out. I don't want her to start realizing when we are together (shower, sex, etc) that I'm not attracted to her body (Man I feel like sh\*% typing this out). I feel like her body was the one thing she had before our marriage that she could feel proud about (abusive mother, long story...) But it's difficult to go back to what you were after multiple kids.

I don't know the gender distribution on this subreddit, but are there any other men who experienced and overcame this? Any advice from married mothers in a similar situation as my wife?

**tl;dr** \- My wife loved her body before kids, hates it now, I feel like crap for not being attracted to it anymore, and want to prevent her from finding out."
"My (40F) partner (44M) proposed with a ring that isn't my style at all, and I would be prohibited from wearing at my job. We each think the other is being ridiculous about it. Help us.


Together 4 years. 

My 2nd marriage/engagement, he was engaged once but broke it off before the wedding because they couldn't agree on where to live (she was from another country).

I work in medicine and do direct patient care. When we first discussed marriage I said I want a *very simple* ring. I'd be totally happy with just a band - there are so many available materials and styles beyond just a traditional gold or silver flat ring - or small, close set stones. There are some styles of silicone ring that I really like as well. I didn't want a setting on the ring. I'm not much of a jewelry person anyway and nothing huge and ""glamorous"" would suit my personal style, I don't care for the look, and I would not be *allowed* to wear it at work. 

It can and would tear gloves and scratch patients. Infants and seniors have extremely fragile skin, a small nick to us can be a huge skin tear to them. 

He understood. 

And then, Thursday night, proposed with a giant brick I hate and never would or could wear. 

I brought it up with him the next day after thinking about how to say it. I said something like ""I really look forward to starting a future with you and I realize a ring is just an object - it's our marriage that matters. But, to me, a ring is a *symbol* of that commitment and I want to be able to wear it. I can't wear the ring you chose at work, and it doesn't suit my style. We talked about what I was looking for in a ring so I'm confused why you deviated from that so drastically. Maybe we could return to the jewelry store together and find a compromise, if you want me to have something ""nicer"" or ""flashier"" than I would choose, we may be able to find something you like that I can also wear. Or, we could return that ring, get a fancy looking ""placeholder"" that's less expensive for the ceremony and formal occasions, and I could wear a simple band or silicone for daily wear. How do you feel about those options?""

He got very upset. 

He thought I was just being self sacrificing by ""not asking for much"" so he wanted the ring to be extra special because I deserve it. 

I appreciate that thought but I was NOT being self sacrificing. I rarely wear jewelry beyond stud earrings or a simple necklace. I'm a tomboy type, always have been, glamour just isn't me. I'm not trying to sell myself short, it's just *not me*. I don't like that style. 

*And even if I loved this ring I CAN'T WEAR IT 90% of the time!!!*

I'd be happy to return this ring and buy a higher end CZ for the wedding or formal occasions if he wants something that looks flashy. It's still not me but I don't mind making that compromise. He gets a say too. Wearing a big ring on nights out doesn't harm me in any way. 

But this ring is useless to me and not to my tastes AT ALL. We've been together 5 years, when I was married previously we used cheap $20 bands for the ceremony and didn't even wear rings! He was a plumber and tried silicone bands but after tearing 2 of them he just went without, and at this time there weren't many available designed for women so again, because of my job, I didn't wear one. When we went out, we wore our gold plated original bands. 

I wonder if my husband to be doesn't feel he's ""competing"" with my ex, or doesn't want to do the same thing but I genuinely have no use at all for this ring. It isn't HIM, it's the RING and I can't get him to understand that. 

What can we do or is there a different way to approach it? 

tl;dr I wanted a simple band or silicone wedding ring because I cannot wear set stones at work, nor do I like large, glam jewelry and that's exactly what my now-fiance proposed with. I don't like and can't wear this ring. I suggested compromises and he's insistent that I ""deserve"" this ring..... that I hate and can't wear. Help. 



"
"I (35F) not sure if my marriage is going to work out with husband (45M).


My tl;dr is at the bottom. 

My husband (45M) and I (35F) have been together for 10 years. We have two children, an 8 year old and a 9 month old. My husband was a very nice husband before I was pregnant and during my second pregnancy. After our second baby was born he started being very mean to me. He has always been a bit selfish, but it was always something I could handle before.

He tries to ruin things I have planned. As an example, I was going to take my dad to an event and my husband calls me and tells me he is going to be two hours late to watch the kids because he has to go shopping. Then he tries to push me to be mad at him. He will say, does this upset you? Are you getting mad? Then he will act like I’m the crazy person when I do get upset with him. 

He makes fun of my hobbies or puts down and activity I do.  I actually took up running because he likes it and it was something I could do without him making fun of me. We planned to go on a run together and I set up a babysitter for an hour. I was waiting for him to show up and he never did. When I asked him what he was doing he said he was running. So he left me hanging while he still got to enjoy the activity. This also wasted a precious hour of babysitting time. 

He is also unnecessarily cruel. I went on a four day trip with our two kids. He stayed at home because he had to work. When I came home he told me that maybe he could pick me up from the airport but maybe not. I told him it’s fine I will take a cab. But even up until I got on my plane ride he was telling me if he was free he would be at the airport but there was no guarantee. Then after I got home he immediately started lecturing me on spending money on our older son. Which, after a four day trip of taking care of two kids (one being a baby) I was just exhausted and didn’t want to be lectured the second I walked through the door. So I just told him I agree with you and I’m sorry. But he just kept going and going. 

Other examples of him being cruel are him telling a family member that I can’t handle the baby by myself. pouring a pop down the sink that I gave him saying he doesn’t want that pop and then grabbing the exact same brand of pop out of the fridge to drink.  

I could go on but I think these might be enough examples. Like I mentioned earlier, these behaviours have been happening after our second baby was born. As things happen I do usually call him out on the spot, but he usually gaslights me in the moment and we get nowhere. He wants to go to couples therapy or just personal therapy for himself (his idea). But I’m honestly wondering is it worth it? I would prefer not to divorce but I’m honestly wondering if we could save this marriage or should I just walk away? 

Tl;dr: husband has been treating me very badly for several months. He wants to go to couples therapy but I feel like the damage is done. How do I proceed?"
"I [58M] caught my neighbors [early 50s?] having sex and my wife [57F] won't stop asking about it


I have a bit of a strange problem I need help with. I live in a rural area and I like to walk my dog at night. One night I happened to stumble upon my neighbors having sex. They were on the front porch, but they probably didn't expect anyone to see them since the houses are so spaced out and surrounded by trees. It was also late like eleven. They didn't see me and I quietly turned back around. I ended up telling my wife about it the next morning over breakfast. Just in an offhanded ""hey, guess what I saw!"" kind of way. I didn't think she would make a big deal out of it or anything.

Boy was I wrong. It's been nearly a month and my wife is still talking about it. She asks questions such as ""What position were they in,""  ""How big was he"" or ""What did her breasts look like?"" I told her I didn't know because I didn't stand around and watch them. But she keeps pushing me for details.

This is very out of character for my wife. She has always been a prude. She hates any kind of dirty talk even during sex. We actually haven't had frequent sex in years, but I tried to initiate it recently and she rejected me so I don't know what the end game of this curiosity is.

Why do you this she is obsessed with it? What should I do here? For the record, we've been married for 32 years.

TL;DR I accidentally saw my neighbors having sex. Told my wife about it offhand and she keeps asking about it."
"My (27f) cousin (32m) with Asperger's can't stand to be around me after being very close and its hurting my relationship with my family.


I (27F) was very close to my cousin (32M) for 3 or 4 years when I was in university. He was diagnosed with Asperger's as a child and always told me I was one of the only people in the family he cared about. 

After being close for a number of years, staying at each other's places, hanging out a lot on the weekends, we went to visit some family together for a week. The trip seemed mostly good. There were small instances of getting on each other's nerves that happen when you spend a lot of time with someone. On the train ride back we didn't talk but I couldn't pinpoint a specific reason. For me I was mostly just tired. 

When I get home from the trip, within a few days he has removed me from the programs we used to chat. When that happened I figured I should give him space because obviously he didn't want to talk to me. Eventually after hearing nothing for a while I removed him on FB which neither of us really use any way. I figured we wouldn't be close anymore but we'd still be family. 

I was also close with his mother (65f) before this  but it became hard to see her because if I went to visit he would have to leave. 

Fast forward to 6 years later (now) at Christmas. My grandmother (93f) is getting older. I see her every Christmas and care about her very much. I drive her to appointments and visit her every once in a while. My cousin never sees her or helps her and never spends Christmas with her because he always hated Christmas any way.

For whatever reason this year he decided he wanted to spend it with our grandmother and his mother at my grandmother's house. 

A few days before Christmas I went over to see another part of the family and that particular aunt was there. She pulled me aside and asked me not to come visit my grandmother on Christmas with my parents because my cousin was going to be there.

I told her that I always visit and wasn't going to change my plans because I don't have a problem with him. To me just because we aren't friends doesn't mean we can't be civil for a couple hours on Christmas. To which she replied with ""well he has a problem with you and he has Asperger's""

I kept my calm and left shortly after. I didn't change my plans because I was worried that this may be my last Christmas with my grandmother but that night when I got home I was really upset. I still don't know what has caused his hatred of me but I know I've never intentionally done something to hurt him and I cant even try to fix it because he just pretends I don't exist. 

My parents of course were also upset because they were part of the visit.

It caused an argument between my dad (59m) and aunt who are brother and sister.

On Christmas day we go anyway. Just for a short visit and to drop off gifts.

For the few hours we were there my aunt and cousin hid in the laundry room for the condo complex.

Now, whenever I'm with other family these 2 get brought up. Everyone knows why he is so mad but no one will tell me and they blame me for going over there. Even in situations where I'm going out of my way to help family they still bring them up and tell me how great they are and it makes me feel so upset. 

How can I maintain my relationships with the rest of the family when I feel like poison is going their ears and I cant defend myself? Is there a way I can tell them I don't want to hear anything about that cousin or aunt without being completely unreasonable?

TL;DR - My (27f) cousin (32m) with Asperger's hasn't talked it me in 6 years and it's affecting my relationship with the rest of the family- he can't even stand to be in the same house on Christmas day for a few hours.

"Girl at work blesses every sneeze in the office (including her own) except for mine?!?


 

So I work with a girl, we'll call her Mary, who compulsively says bless you to every sneeze in earshot, she even blesses her own sneezes with a little ""bless me"".

In the last few weeks I've started to notice that out of everyone in the office, none of my sneezes get blessed, even though our desks are about 1m a part. This morning one of the three of us in our pod sneezed and Mary says bless you to her, I sneezed about 20 seconds later and got zilch.

We've never had any issues or even small disagreements. We're very different people so we don't really do small talk or anything, but I've never been anything but civil and helpful to her.

I can't believe this is annoying me like it is but it's taking all my willpower to not be like ""where's my blessing?"" and sound like a fkn nutter. It's honestly making me feel crazy that this is annoying but it is, how do I ignore it/address it without sounding absolutely insane?

TL;DR a girl I work with blesses every sneeze in the office, including her own, except for mine and it's making me feel crazy."
"Boyfriend's(24 M) unemployed pursuit of esports career for past 12 months is wearing on me(28 F)


I have been in a relationship with my boyfriend for four years. He graduated from college 14 months ago and then decided that he wanted to pursue an esports career, possibly in Overwatch writing/casting/coaching, but I'm not seeing visible progress. In one year he has written only two articles, has only publicly casted two games, and hasn't moved past the ""tier 3 scene""; scrimmage games and ""vod reviews"" for his lower-level team consume all of his time. This is eating 10+ hours a day, 6+ days a week, and he hardly spends time with me anymore. 

I've tried being patient and supportive... but I got frustrated with him still not even having a proper online presence until 3 months ago, so I built him a bunch of professional graphics to create a brand for his online identity. I also built him a website as an additional publishing space, but he doesn't want it public ""until he has written more stuff""..... We paid for it jointly and I spent hours building it and the site has now been private for three months. He keeps setting all Twitch streams to private. Asking him to write anything always backfires so I don't bother anymore. His scattershot method of ""work hard running small teams and eventually run into job contacts"" doesn't appear to be working, but he gets defensive when I ask about things. I've never played Overwatch because I have addiction risk factors and no time or energy for it, but not knowing the game makes it harder for me to talk with him because it's all he does.

I don't want to leave him, but I've lost trust in him to make progress on his own and am feeling resentful about being the only one with an income. I know he considers what he does to be ""work"", but it doesn't pay the bills. I'm not getting enough help or attention and my heart feels heavy. I don't want to ""kill his dreams."" I know this kind of career takes time to learn, but shouldn't I be seeing progress if he's supposedly spending thousands of hours on this? Any feedback on how I should handle this? Am I supposed to stay patient?

**TL;DR; : Am running out of patience with long term partner's lack of income, lack of progress, and him not spending time with me anymore. I love him a lot, but he's not making progress with his ""esports career path"" and it's draining me; I'm not sure what to do.**"
"I (32/F) want to politely but firmly explain to my husband (32/M) that I don’t want our daughter (2/F) to be left alone with my MIL (54/F) anymore.


His mother is conservative, set in her ways, etc. 

I never really saw it as a problem before, but now that we have a small child retaining everything around her, I don’t want his mother’s unending, “Close your legs. Learn to do it now when you’re still young or else ...” to be in our daughter’s ear. It’s weird and uncomfortable and my mother, who is older than her, isn’t like that at all, so it’s not just an age thing. 

Our daughter likes to play, run around, etc. In a couple of weeks she’ll be 3, that’s old enough to know what adults are saying to you and to take in the energy that they’re giving off even if you don’t quite understand it. Maybe I’m overreacting but my MIL’s views on women are *different* at best, and incredibly damaging at worst. We’ve never really disagreed on anything until now. She was always good about keeping her opinions to herself in the past, but now that our daughter is getting a little bit older, my MIL feels the need to insert her views on how “girls should behave”. 

My husband always laughs it off and tells his mother that she’s wasting her breath. But it’s not quite funny to me anymore. If she’s talking like this now, when our daughter isn’t even 3, I can’t imagine the bullshit that will come out of her mouth when our daughter enters  high school. 

We recently moved closer to the school that we want our daughter to attend when she’s old enough, which happens to be close to my MIL. For that reason, she’s been coming around a lot, finding any excuse to drop by unannounced and remind my daughter to not only close her legs, stand when someone older enters the room and to stay away from the neighbourhood boys (there are twin boys in the house across the street that my daughter plays with and whose parents are really nice and have done a lot for us since we moved in) she also warns my daughter that those boys will “want something” from her “one day”. 

It’s really gross and not the sort of bullshit that I want around my daughter. Ever. Those boys are adorable, smaller than her, and their parents are the sweetest. If I happen to notice anything strange about that family,
I’ll be the first person to point it out and distance us from them, but I haven’t noticed anything along those lines. And I don’t want my daughter to grow up living in fear of men or to go so far as to blaming herself for any unwanted attention she may receive from men. I get where my MIL is coming from, but reminding my daughter to “close her legs or else* when she’s still a small child, is only going to hurt her view of the world moving forward. 

And I have a strong feeling my MIL is only doing this to get back at me for having short hair, working in sex therapy and essentially carrying myself differently from her and the type of woman she wanted for her son. 

Most of the time MIL’s remarks are communicated in a joking way. But I know that look and that voice and I don’t like it. When my husband and I are around, it’s okay. But I would rather we just look for a daycare or hire a sitter to look after our daughter when we’re at work or busy. I think it would be easier to do that than to rely on his mother for help, to which I was reluctant in the first place. I can’t imagine the type of weirdness that comes out of her mouth when we’re not around. 

I appreciate the help, but I’d rather pay for childcare. I’ve already found a daycare close by that I like. I just have to find a way to explain this to my husband. He obviously loves his mother, thinks she’s completely harmless. And she raised him, a mature and loving guy, so she’s obviously not completely terrible. But I don’t want her talking like that around our daughter, and I feel that putting her in daycare is easier and of course less awkward than asking his mother to stop saying those things. Even if we ask her to stop saying those things, it’ll come out in private, when we’re not there. We’ve all known older women who are like that and who get away with it because they “know better” and have “done this before” or something along those lines. 

**tl;dr** His mother’s views on what it means to be a woman are troubling to me and I don’t want our daughter around that when I’m not there to guide her at such a young, but important age where she’s retaining everything around her and so curious about the world. How do I tell my husband without hurting him or making it awkward for us?

"[UPDATE] I (30F) recently started dating an awesome guy (33M) and am constantly waiting for the other shoe to drop


OP: [https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/a8dvqm/i\_30f\_recently\_started\_dating\_an\_awesome\_guy\_33m/](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/a8dvqm/i_30f_recently_started_dating_an_awesome_guy_33m/)

&amp;#x200B;

Thanks everyone who responded to my last post. I know it wasn't super exciting or dramatic but I really appreciated the perspective, especially from the two people who had experienced similar feelings in new relationships.

Pretty much right after making that post I was distracted and stopped responding because my partner became incredibly sick. As I mentioned in a comment he was back in his home country visiting family for Christmas/New Years. While there he was bitten by a mosquito and contracted a pretty serious viral disease. He spent most of his vacation in and out of the hospital and on bed-rest.

That having happened kind of caused a shift in my frame-of-mind. I was no longer anxious about the relationship, I was just anxious about him and his health. I checked in on him every day (before that I was texting fairly infrequently, not wanting to be a bother during his vacation), took some time off work for when he arrived home so I could help around his place/make sure he was eating okay and I've accompanied him to the hospital a few times now due to him continuing to experience issues from the original disease and have more time booked off worked to attend upcoming appointments with him.

Due to all of this getting thrown at as out of no where we've gotten a **lot** closer. We've started spending a lot more time together, I've met his parents, we've exchanged 'I love yous', we're planning a vacation together and biggest of all we're now planning to move in together this summer once the lease on my place is up.

I think before we were both so worried about moving too quickly for the other person and scaring them off that we were both playing it cool and feeding into each other's insecurities.

I still have some anxiety sometimes, but he's just so great, so consistently, I get over it pretty quickly now and it's easier to recognise that it's my own insecurities rather than it looming.

So overall things didn't go exactly as planned, but I'm hopeful his medical issues will be sorted out soon and romantically things honestly couldn't be better!

**TL;DR:** My boyfriend got super sick right after I posted last time, and it forced me to get over some of my hangups and just focus on him. Things have been great ever since and continue to get better."
"My (37F) friend (43F) freaked out on me after I asked her to stop talking about her celebrity crush so much.


  

Throwaway, some details changed for anonymity. This is a ridiculous situation and I’m hoping some of you can provide me with perspective that I may be missing. 

I’ve been friends with Stella for almost 15 years. I dated her younger brother first, then met her. He passed away a decade ago and she has struggled a lot with this but has never sought out any help. She was always the fun, goofy, airheaded, friend that never took anything seriously. She has been obsessed with celebrities &amp; pop culture since birth. She idolizes Drew Barrymore &amp; has tried to copy her life &amp; look for years now. She cares a lot about material things and upholding the image she has of herself. For example, her car is falling apart to the point she’s embarrassed to be seen in it, but instead of getting a new one she just bought herself a pair of Gucci slippers (that she thinks is ugly) bc she recently saw one of her favorite celebrities wearing them. That’s just Stella.

A few years ago, Stella discovered a very popular British boy band. Overnight she became completely obsessed. Everything revolved around this band. We all laughed at first bc she was never the boy band kind of gal; she was always too ‘hip’ for that. During their final tour, her husband managed to get them tickets one state away. After the show they waited around outside the tour bus for hours and the band never showed. Stella had a breakdown and cried all night bc she didn’t get a chance to see her favorite member of the band after the show. She cried during the entire 5-hour drive home and immediately went online and bought a ticket (just for her, not her husband) to their next show 2 states south, got back in her car &amp; drove 13 hours by herself to their next show. 

After the band broke up &amp; her favorite member went solo, everything then began to revolve around him. She has spent thousands of dollars going around the country to see his shows. She has spent thousands of dollars on merchandise &amp; decorated her entire house with memorabilia, including a life-sized cardboard cutout of him she keeps in the living room. She has even brought the cutout to dinner with friends &amp; brought him to her birthday party. She thinks it’s ‘tee hee so quirky!’ Her party’s hashtags were all #30flirtyandthriving. She’s 43. A few people tried to talk to her about her behavior &amp; she cut them off bc she thought they were implying they’re ‘too cool’ for her. And the age thing? Everyone was like WTF? Honestly, at our age, no one cares about stuff like that anymore. It’s the obsession that’s worrying people &amp; the fact she’s living in a fantasy world now.  It’s gotten to the point that her whole life revolves around this celebrity and she cannot have a conversation with anyone without the conversation being turned back to this celebrity. She talks about him like they’re really friends. People avoid her. She made friends with a 22 y/o she works with &amp; now spends every free moment out drinking with this girl. She also befriended a mutual friend’s 20 y/o niece &amp; has invited her (&amp; paid) to go to these shows bc no one else will. Mutual friend does not like this &amp; thinks it’s weird but has only told her to be careful with his niece and not get her in trouble. 

Recently, this behavior began to wear on me. Not just this, but the way she talks about crush &amp; other celebrity crushes. She’s always had to have someone to crush on, usually her little brother’s friends. She has been sending me non-stop social media pictures, songs, memes, whatever about this guy and her crushes. The thing is though, these are all reallllyyyy young guys, or they look young. She jokes about herself being a pedophile and how her crushes look 12 or 14. She recently told me she was bored with her husband and was thinking about 'finding a young hottie to make out with'. She went on Tinder &amp;set her age preference 18-24 and told her husband. He got mad and made her delete it but she’s on it again and he doesn’t know. I gently tried to tell her I thought it was weird and made me uncomfortable, (esp to have pics on my phone from her of a kid that looks like he hasn’t gone through puberty saying yeah, I’m a pedo &amp; he looks 12 but he’s a yummy 12!) but she just laughed. I started ignoring the messages bc I didn’t know what to say. I am NOT a fan of this person at all. I am almost 40 &amp; having constant conversations about this guy just weirds me out. She noticed I stopped responding to her and asked me what was wrong, so I told her that I felt unheard when we talked bc every conversation we have is about this celebrity and she ignores a lot of what I say to keep talking about him and ‘it’s a bit much sometimes’. Big mistake.

Stella responded by weaponizing everything I had told her in confidence over the last year against me. I lost my father and grandfather last year &amp; told her I was struggling &amp; lonely and that it sucks being an adult without the friendships I had when I was younger bc we all grew apart. I also know I haven’t been the best friend bc of my grief.  She threw all of that in my face and basically threatened me not to make her mad bc she’s one of my only friends. She called me overly sensitive and accused me of overreacting. I was so shocked. Her messages to me were straight up hateful and extremely disproportionate to what I said. I was so hurt that she would respond like this. I’ve never seen that side of her before. She cut me out of her life and said that I am too quick to cut people out of my life and I would regret it. I never said anything about cutting anyone out of my life. 

It’s been a few weeks since and she’s started trying to reach out a little and I don’t know what to do. I don’t want to throw away such a long friendship, but I think it’s broken at this point. I don’t feel what I said was wrong. A mutual friend of ours told me I should have just kept quiet and let her talk about her fake boyfriend because it makes her happy and ‘we all know how she is’. Another just laughed like yeah that’s Stella. She’ll get over it. Get over what? I feel like she flipped out bc I was so close to saying something to her about the age of this guy, and her other crushes, and she attacked before I could get the chance. I don’t think she’s a pedophile. But. There is something there that in my gut I know is wrong. I just don’t know how to put it in words, or even if I should bring it up. 

So, Reddit, this is a ridiculous fight, but I want to know if anyone is seeing the red flags I’m seeing. Is it a stupid fight bc I hurt her feelings or is there something else causing her to lash out? I honestly can’t tell. Sorry this is a mess but I can provide any other details if needed. I’m just weirded out.

TL:DR My girl friend’s acting like a pedo, I gently called her out, she freaked."
"My boyfriend (27M) and my (21F) sex drives are super mismatched and it’s making me feel used


We’ve been together for 6 months and while our sex drives have always been mismatched, lately I can’t take it anymore. 

If he had his way, I think my boyfriend would have sex 2-3 times a day, every day, maybe more.

I, on the other hand, only really want to have sex 1-2 times a week. 

The result is that I end up conceding and we have sex a lot of times when I’m not in the mood/don’t want to. At first I saw it as a reasonable compromise you make when you love someone. But as time as gone on, I’ve felt worse and worse about it. When we have sex and I’m not in the mood, I feel like he’s disregarding my wants and needs for the sake of his own pleasure. I don’t get wet at all, even if he goes down on me, when my head isn’t in it. This just makes me further feel like he’s just using my body to get off, instead of it being a mutual act. 

It doesn’t matter if I’m dead tired, sick, or just verbally say “I’m not in the mood”/“I don’t want to have sex.” He still wants to. Don’t get me wrong, he would never force me. But he’ll show me his boner and say he really needs it and sweet talk me until I give in.  Or he’ll ask me to please just do him a favor and let him get off. It makes me feel cheap and used. I don’t know what to do because I feel like it’s selfish if i really put my foot down and say no. Thoughts? 

Tl;dr my boyfriend’s sex drive is way higher than mine. We have sex even when I’m not in the mood or just plain don’t want to. It makes me feel sad and like he’s using my body. I don’t know how to broach the topic. "
"I (52M) am thinking of divorcing my second wife (48W) because she can't get along with my daughter (13F) and daughter has left to live with my ex full time.


  

Throwaway account.

&amp;#x200B;

TL:DR I am thinking of divorcing my second wife because she and my 13 yo daughter can’t stand each other and now my daughter has moved in with her mother full time.

&amp;#x200B;

So, backstory: I got married young, I was 22, she was 21. We were basically high school sweethearts. We were together for a long time with no kids, but after probably 10 years of marriage, we (mostly me) decided we wanted children. Getting pregnant turned out to be a lot more difficult than anticipated. We tried for several years without success, and eventually, after some drama (again, mostly me) we decided to spend a lot of money on fertility treatments. That eventually worked and we got pregnant with twins. They were born in 2002. Great kids. Then, a few years later she very unexpectedly got pregnant again spontaneously. We had a daughter in 2005. I love her to death. 

&amp;#x200B;

Due to the cost of daycare, we decided to move to back to our hometown. We had family and other resources and the cost of living was lower. She quit her job and took care of the kids full time; I was working full time. Things seemed good. However, a few years later, out of the blue (for me) my then wife says she wants a divorce. I was devastated. That was in 2010 and I still haven’t really gotten over it to be honest. I don’t know if there was any infidelity; I suspect there was, but it didn’t really matter to me. We were married for 22 years.

&amp;#x200B;

We split custody of the kids 50/50. I pay child support. She is with another man now (although not married), who is a good guy. He has divorce drama of his own but that’s neither here nor there. I have a cordial but not exactly friendly relationship with the two of them.

&amp;#x200B;

While I was floundering, trying to figure out what to do next, I meet a woman who I liked, and who liked me, and we started seeing each other. I waited a while to introduce her to my kids, but after a couple of years our relationship seemed pretty solid, and she moved into the house I was renting. After my ex and her BF bought me out of the house, New Wife and I bought a house together. We got married in 2016. This is her first marriage.

&amp;#x200B;

My relationship with her has always been good, but the relationship between New Wife and my kids has always been a bit of a struggle. She had a very different childhood than I did. Her family in general is very strict and prone to harsh punishments and recrimination. By way of example, she got into an argument with her father when she was 18 over how she was spending her money and he kicked her out of the house and they have not spoken since. That was 30 years ago, and she has not had any meaningful interaction with her father in those 30 years. Despite this, she considers him a good father because she and her two brothers are “hard working.” Don’t get me started. 

&amp;#x200B;

I, on the other hand grew up largely unsupervised and I sort of just did my own thing. I have always had that kind of relationship with my kids. I never really limited their screen time, or got on them about homework, or things like that. I am there if they need me, which often times they do, but I am content to let them find their own way. Not to say that I am absent - I coached soccer every year from the time my boys were 5. I think I have been a good father to all three kids. I love them all very much, I think partly because I had to make a very conscious decision to have them and put a lot of effort into making that a reality. But I am not much of a disciplinarian.

&amp;#x200B;

In any event, my relaxed parenting style aggravates New Wife quite a bit. Things will go smoothly for a while but every six months or so we will have a big argument over disciplining the kids, with her saying that I am “not being a parent” or something to that effect. Generally it blows over after a few days. Also, FWIW, my wife cannot stand my ex. She hides it from the kids but they can tell. When the kids are not around she generally refers to her as “that bitch.” This was reassuring at first but has increasingly been problematic in terms of co-parenting.

&amp;#x200B;

The twins, being 16 now, have sort of aged out of our disagreements about parenting style. They are driving, come and go as they see fit and are fairly happy and well adjusted. My daughter, on the other hand is 13 and is in the depths of being a surly teenager. She and my current wife do not get along, mostly because my daughter is a self-absorbed annoying teenager and my wife constantly wants to punish her for being obnoxious. Or, more precisely, wants me to punish her for being obnoxious. Its constantly, “you need to punish your daughter for being rude.” And I usually just shrug and say, “She’s 13, what do you expect.” 

&amp;#x200B;

We have been to counseling about this precise situation several times, with little effect. Our therapist has given what I consider to be good advice, from “just let him (me) to the parenting” to “sometimes it’s more important to get along than to be right.” The latter is often where I wind up – I’d rather apologize than stand my ground, I’d rather smooth things over then stand on principal. Both daughter and New Wife are all about the principal. 

&amp;#x200B;

So I was content to let this just sort of fester for a few more years because I have a feeling things will sort themselves out. However, things between my wife and my daughter have really escalated recently. Not too long ago, my wife got really angry with my daughter (and with me for “allowing it to happen”), threatened to leave (i.e. divorce me), took my daughter’s picture off our bedroom wall, threw it on the floor, stomped on it and kicked it across the room. Then she stormed out of the house. A few days later she was apologetic, and I accepted, and we just ignored it. Like you do.

&amp;#x200B;

Everything came to a head a few days ago when they got into an argument over my daughter’s behavior when my wife picked her up from school. Daughter was on her phone, in her own world and not interacting with New Wife or New Wife’s mom. Drama ensued. Threats of punishment were made. Daughter eventually said that she no longer wanted to live with me, and wanted to move in with my ex full time. This wasn't the first time she has said that, but the first time she really meant it.  

&amp;#x200B;

I was heartbroken, but on the other hand, I feel like I can’t be responsible for forcing my wife and daughter to live together, even part time. Frankly, it is a lot easier for me emotionally to have them separated. That being said, I feel like I have been put into a situation where I am being forced to choose between New Wife and my daughter. I can have one or the other, but not both. I don’t expect things will blow over, given New Wife’s proclivity for holding onto a grudge.

&amp;#x200B;

So I am contemplating whether I want to continue this marriage. I have a lot less invested in it than I did my first marriage. And it seems to be hurting my relationship with my children. And honestly, I would be fine on my own. 

&amp;#x200B;

Anyway, thanks for letting me vent. "
"Am I [29F] in the wrong for refusing to revisit an ugly fight with my former best friend [30F] whom I see as toxic?!


Me 29 female, she is 30. This happened last October. We've known each other for 5 years, bonded very quickly over common experiences, but most of our friendship was long distance.

It was an ugly fight where I criticized a vindictive behaviour she was doing, and she immediately turned on me, screaming, accusing me of being self righteous, used personal things I told her from my past against me, started counting on her fingers all my 'flaws' and gave no regard to the possibility that this might, just might, be a misunderstanding - which, to me, it was.

This was last October when I was at her place for a quick holiday (I had bought a ticket and flew 7 hours only to see her). The way she behaved showed me her true colours. She stepped on a big fat red line and on one of my personal values: we may fight, but we should never purposefully hurt one another - let's keep it civil. After this, I couldn't see her the way I used to. She was no longer my best friend.

Four days after I came home, I wrote her an email explaining to her my point of view, and how I see the origin of the fight was a misunderstanding, and how I didn't appreciate her using my past against me. She wouldn't have it - she wasn't in a place to understand what I was talking about. To be fair, she seemed to be consumed by what was happening in her personal life that she couldn't look beyond that. So I let it go, and concluded it by saying: let's agree that we just have different views on this - I still love you very much and will always be here for you. I wasn't preoccupied with proving my self right - this is not my priority. In my email to her, I also apologized for anything that I did or said that upset her during my stay in general - I was short tempered at times, and I did apologize for that explicitly.

We left it at that. I acknowledged that our friendship is no longer the same, and moved on. I remember her lovingly, but don't miss her after what I've seen. So naturally, we haven't spoken frequently since then.

Yesterday, 7 months after the fight, she comes to me saying she'd like to have a discussion about what had happened because she feels we haven't resolved the conflict, and because I am of value to her. She said: ""I am still upset by things that happened when you visited and even though I ignored so much for months, I now feel you're in a stronger place where we can have a mature discussion"". Whaaat! I have no idea what she means by i'm stronger now, and this sounds very condescending to me! Let alone the fact that she kept a lot of things bottled up inside! Nothing good or constructive will ever come of that!

I told her I didn't wish to revisit what happened. I moved past it, no grudges whatsoever, and that I didn't think talking about it will do any good. To be frank, I do not wish to talk about it at all - I believe in honesty and open communication but sometimes some things are better left unsaid. And broken relationships can not always be mended with rational conversations. Sometimes when things are tainted, they're tainted forever. I accepted that our friendship was tainted, and achknowledged it won't be the same, but I moved on. I didn't feel the need to milk it and prove anything beyond that email. If she had wanted to discuss all of this back then, I would've listened with all my senses.

But now?? It seems to me that she has issues to resolve with herself, and wants to feel better about herself by talking to me about our fight - but I am honestly not willing to entertain that or be an audience for her. I don't care enough.

She texts me again saying that it was important to her that we revisit a foundational moment in our past that had left her with so many doubts and questions over the future of this friendship.. Omg I can't do this! This to me is too dramatic at this stage in my life! Deal with your doubts on your own, or talk with me in a graceful way about them, which I know she won't do because she's been bottling up and will do what she did last year - use my personal details against me. I can't take that shit anymore i'm too old for this!

TL;DR: Sanity check! Ugly fight with friend 7 months ago. She truned insulting and vindictive. Am I in the wrong here for not giving my former best friend a chance to voice her feelings that she's been bottling up since then!? I don't care about our friendship anymore.  

SORRY for the wall of text and thanks for everyone who will reply!"
"My (20M) parents (44M, 42F) keep bringing up my ex and it’s upsetting me


Sounds petty, but my ex and I dated for 4 years.... she went off for university and we made it work until she went flatting where she chose drinking and banging other guys over me. It was a terrible breakup and I decided to ghost her completely and recently she’s been trying to reach out to me but I’ve been busy with university and have no time for it.

I’ve sat my parents down and asked them to respect the fact I’d like to move on and not talk about her. That was 2 weeks ago. Almost EVERY day I’ve had someone ask me “how is she?” “Spoken to her?” “Did you see her tagged in this photo?” And I eventually snapped this evening. They know damn well I have a two exams this week worth 20 and 30% respectively and this is my final semester of university and I’m not messing this up. 

I’ve been socialising more and experiencing a lot more, compared to when I was in that toxic, manipulated relationship. And I’ve been enjoying myself with all my friends! And made so many more too. As well as bought tickets for a couple festivals and a trip to America in August this year with a few friends. 

I got a shouting at for snapping at them, despite my constant efforts and pleads to move on. How could I approach this? I’m considering going to my mates house and staying there for a while (he’s offered). We’ve been broken up for 7 weeks and I have never been better. And just want her out of my life (as harsh as it sounds). But she manipulated me, controlled me and hurt me in ways I no longer want to remember.

TL;DR - My parents constantly bring up my ex despite me asking them to not and I eventually snapped and I got in trouble for it."
"I [27F] am thinking of breaking up with my boyfriend of three years [32M] because of my weight loss plan.


So I have a relationship issue. I am generally a very healthy person, but within the past 1.5 years, I have been severely depressed. I gained 31 pounds of depression weight, going from a 21 BMI to 26. I calculated my caloric needs to lose weight, and decided on a 1,600 cal high-protein/fat and low-carb eating plan, with three servings of fruit and three servings of vegetables daily. (I am 5'9 and work out three times a week) I will also interment fast occasionally. No other food restrictions. I just started this plan two weeks ago. My boyfriend, who has never had a weight problem, thinks that I am ""eating too much."" Most of my meals now involve some combination of large salads (no excess dressings), meat, steamed vegetables, fruit, and soups. I am tracking my calories dilengently on MyFitnessPal. (I also eat carbs, but not as much as before.) I've tried explaining that intemeient fasting, combined with a high volume of low-calorie foods means that my meals will appear larger than a typical 1,200 calorie burger. (I am currently eating two or three meals a day.) He refuses to listen to me, though he has never had a weight problem. I have tried to show him peer-reviewed studies that support my weight loss plan but he thinks that he knows what he's talking about because his mom is a nutritionist. (Who hasn't worked in that industry in 30 years, but I digress...)




Yesterday, for dinner we went to Sweetgreen (a salad chain in the DC area), and I ordered a 600-calorie salad. I skipped the free bread (120 calories) and decided on an extra serving of chicken instead (100 calories). It fit my calorie plan for the day. He thinks that I should not have had double chicken with my salad and instead have just stuck with the free bread. He thinks it ""is too much.""




Now I am unconfortable about eating at home and am thinking of breaking up with him. I did not ask him or his mom (who lives in the West Coast and doesn't know what I eat) for nutritional advice, just for support as I try to reduce my depression and get my old body back. I am thinking that maybe I should move out and become single again because it's made me feel really low and discouraged. I want to note that he has not, ever, said anything about my weight gain. Can anyone please share some advice?


TLDR: I have been fasting &amp; eating a lot of veggies, protein, and fruit to lose weight, but my boyfriend sees my large plates and thinks that it is ""too much."" Feeling down about it and thinking about breaking up with him over it."
"Just found out my fiance has hidden credit cards [30F, 31M]


Hi reddit,

I'm a bit drunk so please bear with me.

Me and my fiance have been together for three years. He's American, I'm Australian. We met in the US when I was working there. A year ago I found out he had about US$4k on credit cards. I grew up poor, so I immediately sorted him out with balance transfers to zero interest cards to pay off. He gave me his original credit card so he couldn't spend on it.

Fast forward a year... I moved back to Aus a few months later, he moved to Aus to be with me, left everything behind. He can't find a job here, he ended up as a part time barista. It's expensive too - rent is US $1400 a month for a 1 bed apartment. Don't talk to me about the price of avocados. But, I can pay all the expenses by myself.

I do get a bit fucked off when we go on dates and I have to pay everything. I worked hard for my money, I didn't expect to have to split it with a partner. I do resent him for not having a full time job. We split the rent proportionally, so if he doesn't pick up shifts and sits on his arse, he doesn't have to pay rent. But, I also enjoy his company. I'm happy to pay for his $6 beer along with my $20 cocktails. He also does the shopping, cleaning, etc. But I still work more overall.

Anyway. I recently find out that: he hasn't been paying off his zero interest cards properly, so he's had late fees and penalties. He has also been spending on them (wtf? rage). These are in the range of US$4k still. I offered to pay them off before the interest started, and he can pay me. He's been prevaricating about that for about two months. Today I decide it's time to fix it. I see that he hasn't paid his cards for two months (=penalties and interest, about $200; he doesn't seem to understand that this is money that he wouldn't have had to pay, if he figured things out properly). 

Well, tonight he owned up to have two other credit cards. The thing that gets me is, one of them is the original credit card that we did the balance transfer for. The bank sent him a new one (maybe he ordered it, maybe it expired). He spent $3k on that in the last year.

There are ""extenuating"" circumstances (his mum died and he went from a certain standard of living with free rent and free food to nothing, so ok, I kiiiind of get that). But still. He was living under my roof and putting bloody Nintendo games on his US credit card knowing he couldn't pay. I also feel responsible that he moved here (flights and visa are not cheap) and now he has to work in a cafe just to be with me.

He just doesn't get it. He just doesn't seem to understand. He literally said ""my name is on the card, that money is mine"". And that if I paid them off, and he owed me the money, he would feel indebted to me. I mean what? It's the same, except I don't add on a ton of fees. He doesn't seem to care about the debt.

I am fucking furious. Like smash things furious. He deceived me. He told me his is ashamed. I was going to pay off his original debt and have him pay me back. He refused - because he doesn't want to owe me the money. At least he has some small integrity?

He has about US$2000 limit left on one of his cards; a flight back to the US is about US$1000. Do I tell him to book a flight and fuck off? Or do I work it out? This is the man (child?) I thought I would marry. 

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR: fiance has secret credit cards. Do I tell him to leave?

&amp;#x200B;"
"My (26F) boyfriend (28M) hates the fact that I’m seeking help for my depression.


Alright. SO and I have been together for three years. Basically I’ve decided that I need serious help. I went to the doctor today and got a prescription again (I was on antidepressants at a younger age) and contacts to some local therapists. So far so good, I’m feeling a little more positive about taking control of my situation. 

SO knew about my doctor’s appointment but didn’t have much to say about it until today. When he saw the list of contacts on the counter, he immediately confronted me about it and asked “Why would you want to see a therapist?” And I said, “Because I’m depressed?” And he went on this whole rant about how he saw a therapist when he was a kid and how they are stupid and are just in it for the money. That it would just be a waste of time and money to me. I told him I wanted to get better and do what I can to get better. 

We didn’t talk about it for a while, but periodically throughout the night tonight he would bring it up again.

My SO is an alcoholic - he drinks every night. One comment that he said to me was, “If you see a therapist, they’re going to ask about me and they’re going to know I’m an “alcoholic.” Then they’re just going to judge me and blame your depression on me.” 

He kept asking me throughout the night why I would want to see a therapist, that I have nothing to really be depressed about and that I don’t need money-hungry therapists to just give me their opinions and mess with my head. 

Another time he asked me what I would talk about with a therapist. I again said my depression. Probably a lot about my father who passed away almost 2 years ago now. His response was, “That was already two years ago now though. You’re past the grieving stages.” 

Honestly I don’t know how to handle him with this. I told him I’m going to see a therapist and try out antidepressants any way to see what works for me, and he continues to let me know that he’s completely not on board with it and thinks it’s a stupid decision to make. How can I talk to him about this? How can I make someone close to me understand what it is I’m going through and that I’m making steps to be a better me?

TL:DR My SO said some extremely hurtful things when he found out I’m getting help for my depression and he’s completely not on board with me going to a therapist or taking antidepressants. He thinks I’m fine just the way I am."
"My [19f] bro has creepy friends and is kind of creepy himself [20m]. I feel very uncomfortable near them. What should I do?


They are in the basketball team and are pretty much jocks. They walk together and sort of intimidate people sometimes. A few times they have passed by and my brother says something to me me and they laugh. Sometimes I reply with something embarrassing he did when he was a boy and they mock him and bust him around and he gets angry at me. So now they sometimes call me something like ""roaster"" and do a stupid flipping meat motion with their hands.

They have a sort of saying: can't put d_cks in college degrees. Which basically means they don't care about girls they just want them to shut up and blow them. They say something like ""I went on a date and she wouldn't kiss me"" and another one goes ""can't put your d_ck in her college degree, man"" like it's wisdom.

It's kind of their way of saying ""b_ches be crazy"" and I find especially it disgusting.

They are so shameless too. They once told one of my friends she was a ""solid 7"" in the hallway. If you tell them they are assholes they say ""lol triggered"" or say that we know we like it. Another one of my friends made out with one of them (which, ew, but oh well) at a party and they sometimes mention it like, when it comes down to it, we know we'll crawl back to them.

I asked him alone why he let them speak like that to me and my friends and he said they can flip us around like pancakes (obviously, sex), he doesn't care. I felt SO angry and pushed him and he got very angry. I know that was very wrong of me but it's just, ugh.

We don't see them every day but Jesus they are so fucking unbearable. And because they are popular around here pretty much no one calls them out and even laugh along. They probably do the same to every girl they see.

What should I do? Talking to him clearly has no effect.

He didn't use to be like this ALL the time. He used to be very agreeable with a few bouts of asshole behavior. I could handle that and call him out. But now he is in Jock Land^TM and has to be an asshole or else they'll eat him alive or something.

What should I do to get rid of these dudes or be less affected by their BS?

**tl;dr:** Bro has creepy basketball team friends who occasionally verbally harass me and my friends (and probably many more women). How can I handle them and just get rid of their presence?"
"My (27m) wife (25f, together 8 years, married 6) refuses to leave our kids (6f and 3m) anywhere with an unrelated man, and it is starting to cause problems with my sister and her husband (30s, together 7 years, married 3)


I posted this on relationship advice last night, but I didn't really get a lot of replies, so I'm cross-posting here to see if there is anything else I am missing.  I did get some good advice there, but I am posting it here too just because I would like to hear more viewpoints.

My wife is really protective.  We had kids young and she is a wonderful  housewife.  Our son and daughter are homeschooled and she does a  wonderful job of everything.  She is a great mother, a wonderful cook,  and  just the best person I know.  I feel happy knowing how safe she  keeps our children, even though she is a bit of a helicopter parent.  We  have a great marriage aside from this issue.  Since the kids were born,  we have had a policy of never leaving them with any man besides me and  their grandfathers.  This is mostly her policy and just something I agreed to.

So  far, it has worked out fine, but my wife is now refusing to leave the  kids with my sister and her husband (30s, married 3 years, pregnant with  first kid) at all.  We plan to go out of town in a month and my wife is  on the verge of cancelling our trip because my dad and his wife (60s,  together 1 year, married 6 months) won't be able to take the kids while we are gone.  My  sister and her husband volunteered to take the kids and they seem like  they really would like to, but my wife hates the idea because she is  scared of leaving the kids with a man who they aren't related to.

So  anyway, my wife went ahead and asked my sister if she could come stay  at our house with the kids while we are out of town and if she could  leave her husband at their house.  My wife explained to her our policy  about them not being with unrelated men without us present.  Apparently,  this offended my sister and she said no, but that they would still be  happy to keep our kids at their house.  She told my wife that she  thought it was rude of her to request that since we are close and her  husband has never done anything to make us distrust him.  I agree with  my sister on this generally, but I don't think she should have been  offended.  I know my wife doesn't really think sister's husband is a  predator, but it's just a blanket policy we have.  But then my sister  said that we were being sexist towards her husband and that she was hurt  that we would leave them with my dad and his wife even though they  haven't been married as long (they have only been dating a year and they  got married 6 months ago... frankly none of us really care for her but  for some reason my wife is more ok with her).  I talked to my sister and  explained our policy as well and I told her that I trusted her and  everything, but it was just a thing my wife had.  Sister says they are  hurt, but will try to get past it and reiterated to me that she thought  we were being sexist against my brother in law.  I don't think I agree  with her on that and I think my wife just really deeply cares about her  kids' safety, so I told her that I didn't think it was sexist and I  apologized for anything my wife said to upset them.  Hopefully that is  enough.

My  sister and her husband are close friends of ours and I see no reason  why my kids should not be left with them.  He is a pediatric nurse and  the kids love him, but my wife is absolutely not budging on this.  I  feel like this is something that she eventually is going to have to get  passed.  Right now it isn't a big deal since she wanted to homeschool,  but I don't like the idea of my kids never being able to go over to any  of their friends houses without us.  I'm also nervous that if my wife  keeps this up, that my sister may get petty over it and not let us ever  watch their kid.  Our parents have never had a problem with this policy, but my sister seems to think we are being sexist and I guess that makes sense because  the policy affects them more than anyone else.  Divorce is not an option for me, it is  something I don't want and am not even close to ever considering.  I  just really don't like being in the middle of this situation.  I'm looking for a way to help my wife be comfortable with this and at the same time, I don't want to lose my relationship with my sister and her husband, since they are really our best friends.

My questions:

How normal is is for my wife to be this protective and what are things we can do to work on this?  Is this something she really needs to be in therapy for?  People in relationship\_advice said that she should be in therapy, which isn't a thing she is particularly receptive towards.  Also, how can I preserve my relationship with my sister and her husband?  I don't want to side with her against my wife, but I also don't want her to think that I distrust her and her husband.  I feel very caught in the middle of this and I hate it and I just want out.

Some  more background details that may or may not be related: my wife and I  are religious and my sister and her husband are not at all.  They have  promised us that they would never talk about religion to our kids and so  far they have respected that boundary, though that caused a rift  between my sister and wife early on in our marriage.  My sister and I  are close despite our differences.  We have been through a lot together  including losing our mom.

tl;dr:  wife is being a helicopter parent and is refusing to leave kids around  any man if we are not around (even if there will be other people there).   I think it is becoming an issue and my sister is now hurt over it."
"How do I[25F] make my boyfriend[25m] stop proposing to me?


We've been together three years now, but we both agree that we're nowhere near ready to ""settle down"". By that I mean move in, get engaged, get a dog, the whole shebang. I feel happy with where I am in life, and so does he. The issue is that he's always asking me to marry him. But he's not serious.

&amp;#x200B;

We'll be in the car, just talking. Then all of the sudden there'll be silence and he'll say ""marry me"". 

&amp;#x200B;

Or when I stay at his place, he'll get up out of bed to go to the bathroom and on his way out of the bedroom he'll say ""marry me"". 

&amp;#x200B;

He'll say it in public, when people can here and it's embarrassing when I laugh it off and say ""nah"". I look like an asshole.

&amp;#x200B;

Most of all, I'm worried about when he asks me for real that I'm not going to take him seriously. 

&amp;#x200B;

I've asked him to stop, told him my concerns about when it IS the right time that I won't believe him and he still insists on doing it, every time we see each other. How can I word it to make him stop? To really get my point across?

&amp;#x200B;

TL:DR boyfriend won't stop asking me to marry him and I'm sick of it."
"Canada - Me (26f) with my fiancé (31m) of 6 years, cannot agree about weed in the context of a wedding


Hi all, 

Thanks for advice in advance. My fiancé and I are Canadian (cannabis is legal here) and are getting married this summer. We have a good relationship with each other's families. His parents are definitely more conservative than mine. All the typical topics will make them uncomfortable - sex, drugs, and swear words. My family is definitely more liberal. My dad is a former rock-and-roll band member and smokes cannabis. However, it should be noted that our dads get along strangely well, despite being exact opposites. Lately, we've been talking about weed at our wedding. My fiancé wants to ban it outright because his parents will clutch their pearls. I say it's legal and that he needs to just tell them to get used to the idea and if I want to smoke a joint at my own damned wedding, they need to get a grip. What say you, reddit?

TLDR: Is the burden on my fiancé to tell his parents to get used to the fact that weed is legal and people may use it at our wedding?"
"I (23F) defended myself against a mean comment and now everyone is blaming me for causing a scene


A few weeks ago, my boyfriend (26M) and I were invited to a party at one of his best friends homes.

I've met his friends lots of times and get on really well. There were obviously people I wouldn't know at the party but I was feeling really good about meeting new people.

Anyways, a few hours in and I'm having a conversation with my boyfriend and another girl about a particular store. I have a discount card there and me and my boyfriend have just bought a house so we were talking a little about what we could buy there.

As I say something in response to what my boyfriend said, a girl who is roommates with my boyfriend's friend pipes up from across the room and says, ""oh my god. Can you stop talking about this stupid store?""

I was shocked and confused. She wasn't involved in the conversation. Everyone was mingling. I wasn't demanding everyone's attention in the room.

A little irritated, I replied ""I wasn't really talking to you.""

At this point the room has gone quiet and I'm aware that everyone is looking at us. I'm really not the sort of girl to make a scene or argue with anyone in public but her comment and blatant disrespect towards me irked me. It brought up horrible memories of being bullied in school by girls like her.

She turned her back to me eventually and everyone continued to talk. My boyfriend comes to me later in the evening and asked why I said that... I ask what he means and he says his best friend is a little annoyed that I caused a scene with his roommate.

I asked my boyfriend his opinion on the situation and he says he is on my side but he understands his friends point of view too and suggested I should have responded more kindly towards her because ""that's just her personality.""

I'm angry. I'm down right pissed off.

Did I cause a scene?

Tldr: girl made a mean comment to me at a party and I defended myself but now everyone thinks I made a scene..."
"My [33M] wife's [35F] shady-seeming friendship with a man is likely going to end our marriage


My wife and I have known each other for about 2.5 years, been married for about a year, and we have a near-4-month-old baby (who is just the best). My wife is a lawyer who has two offices of her own practice (one in our city, and one in a city about 75 min from home), and I'm a marketer who works remotely. She regularly commutes, and on those drives, she often calls a friend of hers. He's a 60-some-year-old guy who lives far away, and is also a lawyer like her, only much more financially successful.

Now, before you say that he's too old to worry about, I want to bring up that my wife, before our relationship had a several-year two-boyfriend deal in our city and the other city she goes to (that I didn't learn about until we were well within our relationship) with a man about my age (in our city) and a man in his 50s (in the city she commutes to) who did not know about each other. Apparently that all ended only a few months before we got together, and while it was a source of a lot of contention (having been cheated on in a past relationship myself), early in our relationship. While I don't know if it's fair to use somebody's past against them, I also think I'd be a fool not to see the similarities.

Now my wife and this dude apparently chat often enough that I notice. They also email, text, etc. and for most of our relationship I haven't liked him for a few reasons (he was arrested for beating a dog, he has regularly held two girlfriends at once, etc), and I haven't been thrilled about their regular communication. I thought, after he got arrested for beating the dog, that my wife would stop talking to him. She's a big animal lover, but she seems to think he didn't do what he was charged with, and generally explains away his behavior as ""he's a human and he's complicated."" But as far as I could tell, they just weren't talking that much because she was ""mad at him"" for calling the female judge in his case the C-word and that didn't settle well with her.

Anyway, recently the dude has come back into the equation. Several times a week. Probably daily. And for a good deal of our marriage, there's been animosity about my wife and her penchant for not really compromising with me. We fight, I give in, and that's generally that. I've been able to get over some really hurtful shit in the past, and thankfully for the most part, don't hold much bad blood. I try to look toward the future. Still, I told her again, I don't like how close she's become with this guy. And her argument was ""You don't even know how often I talk to him."" I think now my response should've been ""what I do know is already too much."" (Aside: My wife has a ton of male friends. I really, really don't give a shit about them. Those relationships are just... I don't know... more normal and spread out like a friendship generally is with the opposite sex after you're married. Nowhere near the levels of intimacy that this is).

I talked to my counselor about it last week and told her that I know my wife has complained about me to this guy and that she doesn't answer the phone if he calls when I'm around. I've met him once, two summers ago, but only briefly and I didn't get the vibe that he's trustworthy. I told my counselor all that's been happening and she said that women who want a committed relationship wouldn't behave like this, and that I was well within my rights to tell her to curb it.

I got home, pretty angry and pretty much told my wife that she either curbs this relationship or I'm done.

She didn't flinch and said okay then. She says he's a colleague and that I'm just being insecure. She says he's also a friend and a mentor, later, when I point out that they talk about his love-life and I know she complains about me to him. She wouldn't be given an ultimatum, she says, and she has done nothing wrong and she won't be changing anything. We had a horrible weekend. Thankfully, my mom and grandmother had flown in earlier that week from way out of state and they were there to help me. My mom apparently gave my wife a look and that upset her, so she ran out and we had it out in front of my mother. My mom, like everybody else said that what was happening wasn't cool. She even told a story that I didn't know before about her own curtailing of a male friendship because my dad's discomfort.  
My wife and I went out for ice cream to talk. We don't want to divorce, we agree. Divorce would be bad for our daughter and for us. We literally drew out this the idea of having our own ""circles"" of life, and that this dude was part of a circle that didn't involve me. The way she put it kinda made it seem okay, given that sex and emotional intimacy and all that were in the overlapping part of the Venn diagram with her and me (and presumably that meant nobody else). I'm calmed, but still unsettled. (Looking back clearly it's a lie, but more on that here soon).

Well, my wife has her own counselor and we went to see him together on Wednesday. We talked about how we fight a lot and how we have shitty strategies for dealing with hurt. Hers is to withdraw, and mine is to get angry. We talked about the situation with the old dude, and the counselor assured me I had nothing to worry about that she ""doesn't wanna marry him or have sex with him."" But just as we start getting into it DURING THAT FUCKING SESSION, the old dude calls my wife. My wife PICKS UP THE PHONE and tells him she's busy and that she'll call him back.

I'm livid. The counselor says ""okay, I can see you're upset."" He tells his own client, my wife, that it's reasonable for spouses to ask for what I'm asking. He pitches an idea. How about you just talk to him from 9-5, about business? He asks me if I'm ok with that. I say ok that's something at least. My wife says ""How about 9-5 for business and then before 9 and after 5 for friend stuff?"" The counselor says ""That's clearly not a compromise at all.""

Just then, THE DUDE CALLS AGAIN. Let me remind you that my wife, who never picks up the phone to tell me she's busy and she'll call me back, had done just that. And this guy, who is apparently ""just a colleague,"" but also a friend and mentor, feels comfortable enough with my wife that he can make a demanding phone call like that a second time.

The counselor asks me how I feel, I say basically: That seems to me the sort of intimate relationship you don't share with a friend or colleague, but something MORE. The counselor looks at my wife, and we're over time, and he says ""You did tell him you'd call him back...""

My wife makes the excuse that he's probably needs something for court, which doesn't excuse the behavior in any way, and then we go home. Because we have a baby, I'm trying like hell to swallow it. But after a day, I just can't. I'm feeling filled to the brim with resentment. Every sacrifice I notice I make around the house, from putting my towel in a certain place because she prefers it that way, to changing my day because she needs shit, just incenses me.

We had planned on going to the beach with our daughter this weekend, but today I told my wife I'm not going to go. I told her she can call the old dude and he can fly down then. I'm not going to budge. I told her I'm sick of being resentful about this, and I am. I feel like it's just the first cell of relationship cancer that will spread into everything else. I really want to know here: Am I being a jealous asshole? What would you think if you were in my shoes?  


tl;dr: My wife's friendship with an older man is too close and even though I've told her again and again how uncomfortable I am with it, she refuses to curb it."
"I [27F] just found out that my BF [29M] is planning to propose in the worst way possible


My mother is and was always abusive and I cut her out of my life with 23. I haven't had any contact with her since then except a few messages she occasionally sends and I ignore. My older sister 'Grace' had largely the same childhood except she fit my mom's criteria for a good daughter a bit better, but she also has very minimal contact with our mom and we have a good relationship.

&amp;#x200B;

I met my BF 'Brian' about 5 years ago, I've told him about my mom and some details of my childhood. He knows how horrible she was and supported me when I was a mess after cutting her out of my life. He has never met her in person. She knows that I am in a relationship but that's it.

&amp;#x200B;

It's been an 'open secret' that Brian is going to propose to me soon. We have talked in detail about getting married and he has even low-key asked me what the perfect proposal for me would be (I half-jokingly told him 'honestly just send me a whatsapp'). He knows, or should know, that I am a rather private and mostly introverted person, and I've talked to him about my personal hate for public, dramatic proposals.

&amp;#x200B;

A few hours ago my sister Grace sent me a message and said she has something important to warn me about. She said she talked to our mom who bragged to her about me wanting her back in my life. Grace knows that's absolutely not the case so she asked about it and our mom sent her screenshots of Brian messaging her on facebook (my mom absolutely isn't tech-savy enough to fake something like this). Apparently Brian messaged her saying he is planning to propose to me and would like her support and if she would be willing to travel to our hometown to 'surprise' me, give me this huge speech about forgiveness and wanting to reunite the family, and then basically relay his proposal to me at the end.

&amp;#x200B;

I am absolutely fucking baffled as to why he'd think that was a good idea. If this had happened the way they were planning without any warning, well, I can't even begin to imagine how I would have reacted. Obviously Brian doesn't know that I know, and I'm at a loss of how to react. He knows many of the shitty things she did to me and always seemed to support me in staying away from her and at no point have I ever mentioned wanting to reunite with her.

&amp;#x200B;

\---

&amp;#x200B;

\*\*tl,dr:\*\* Apparently my BF is planning to propose to me and make my abusive mom reunite with me which I absolutely do not want. I don't know why he would plan this and what I'm supposed to do about it?"
"I'm (17M) weirded out by him (26M)


Sorry for any mistakes, English isn't my native language.

This person and I volunteer at the animal shelter. We became friends because we walk to the bus station together. He's a college student and I'm in high school. We usually talk about our dogs, video games, books.

Lately though, I feel a creepy vibe about him. I could be imagining it. Not sure. For example: he insists I give him my phone number so we could talk on WhatsApp. I told him no because we already talk on Instagram. We're just work friends anyway. He was angry with me.

Also he's been telling me about his sexual life. It makes me uncomfortable. He sleeps around a lot, with both men and women. Not that I care, but I don't want to listen to that. We're not close friends and I don't even talk *that* vulgarly with them. When I complain, he says I feel uncomfortable because I'm a virgin.

Early on he asked me if I ever even kissed and I said no. He told me ""You'll come to me when you're ready"", but he was laughing and I thought it was a joke. Now with the vulgar talk I'm not sure. It makes him sound creepier.

Am I overreacting or is he being inappropriate? Maybe it's just his personality that's more open?

I don't know what to do. How should I talk to him about this if he sees nothing wrong?

tl;dr: A friend from work (volunteering) seems more and more creepy, need some thoughts about this."
"Am I in the wrong for saying my boyfriend needs to be more considerate?


This all started on Saturday, so only about 5 days ago. I'm 21F, my boyfriend is 25. Also relevant; my little siblings are 17 and 8, respectively. And I've been with my boyfriend for about 6-7 months.

I got a call from my older sister's roommate on Saturday, saying my sister had killed herself. I went immediately to be with my family. The day was filled mostly with me calling police, funeral homes, and cemeteries; as well as picking up a few groceries for my family. I decided it would be best to have my little siblings with me that night and let my parents process things. My boyfriend was understanding of that and even agreed to take my siblings to the mall the next day so my parents and I could pick up a few things from my sister's place.

On Sunday, my boyfriend took them for about 4 hours and I spent that time helping my parents pick up my sister's belongings and sort out some funeral stuff. That night, my boyfriend started pushing wanting to ""settle down"" and move in together. We've actually fought about this before because I don't want to live with anyone right now, I've never lived alone and I like having my own space. I told him it was inappropriate to be pushing these things on me right now, especially things I've already said no to. He got upset and we didn't really speak the rest of the night.

On Monday, I was still not really focused on anything, just barely getting by at work. My boyfriend sent me some joke article for April fools (I didn't even know it was April 1st I was so out of it). I asked why he sent me it because it didn't make any sense and it was a dumb article. He got pissed and said it was just a joke and that I was being condescending for asking why he would send it. He said I needed to consider his feelings. I told him I wasn't in a state where I could consider anything; I'm not sleeping or eating like at all, and that he needed to be more aware of my state. He refused to apologize and told me that he'd ""talk to me when I ready to be calm and stop taking shots at him"" so we haven't really spoken since because I just can't handle it. Am I really just being too emotional and overreacting? Should I have just apologized and let it go?

TLDR; Boyfriend told me I'm being unreasonable and rude after the death of my sister because I've been emotionally fucked up, unsure if I'm overreacting and being too emotional."
"My [25 F] boyfriend [27 M] of seven years spent my inheritance money which was a small sum. I am devastated, but he's never acted like this before. He says it's 'ours'. Am I in the wrong?


**Tldr: My very serious, long-term boyfriend of seven years spent the small amount of inheritance money left by my grandmother. He says, since we share money, that he's in the right. Livid, but doubting myself.**   


Hi there,   


Throwaway because I know people who frequent this sub. So my boyfriend, let's call him 'Jack' has been the love of my life since we met in university. He's always been kind, caring and empathetic and I've never envisioned being with anyone else- I guess that's why I'm so livid.   


Long story short, my mother died when I was young and my dad's out of the picture. My grandma, who was widowed at the time, took me in. Things were always tight with money, but she was such a warm and loving person and worked extremely hard to make sure I didn't want for anything and at least had the opportunities that the other kids had. For that, I'm eternally thankful. She passed away two weeks ago, and I've been beyond devastated- even though she was old and unwell for a while, it was still a shock- I guess it always is.   


I'm a full-time nurse and I love my job but it doesn't that pay that well. I was paying for grandma's aged care facility and basically took care of all of her money stuff, as she had none towards the end, so it was crazily heartwarming and sweet to find out that she'd left me $300 that she'd saved away, secret from me. In her will, she wrote that she wanted me to take a friend, or Jack, to this fancy high-tea place in our city where she look me for special occasions like my 16th, graduation and when I first got my period (lol). I cried and cried when I read this, that she left this money as a surprise to do something wholly sentimental that would remind me of her, and celebrate her life there like we'd celebrated so many of my milestones- I expressed how much this meant to me to Jack, like, there's no way he didn't fully understand. I told him that I wanted to take my oldest from 'Karen', as she was close with grandma and we could reminisce.   


I went to grab the money yesterday, so I could bank it and book the place online but... it wasn't there. I got really anxious and started tearing the room apart, thinking I put it somewhere I didn't remember even though I'm not very absent minded. When Jack came home I was next to tears, exasperated, and asked him if he'd seen it. He was so fucking casual, 'oh yeah I spent it on new tires because the car needed it'... what!? I absolutely blew up at him, screaming about how I support him and his dreams of going back to school because he failed. I pay the rent, bills, shopping and we live dollar to dollar with no savings because of this. Now I just won't be able to go to high tea in the foreseeable future with the money that MY grandma left ME to celebrate HER. He told me I was being irrational, that we're essentially married in that we share money, and what he spent the money on was 'practical' and 'logical'.  I was so shocked (still am), didn't say anything...didn't know what to say and just left to a friends and I'm still there. I've ignored his calls and texts, not through anger but honestly because I just don't know what to say? He seems like an entirely different person.   


And I'm just so sad still, so so sad. I told Karen we couldn't go because the money was gone, and I thought of grandma's note with the will and the crumbled up notes and just broke down.   


If he being rational, and I'm being irrational because I'm overcome with grief and this is a sentimental thing? I feel like I can't trust my mind. "
"I [21F] want to cut my sister [23F] out of my life.


My sister Laura has hated me since I was born. She picks on me constantly and makes me feel unwelcome in my own home. My parents have always and always will side with her. 

Laura has cystic fibrosis and is constantly in and out of hospital. Because of this my parents are understandably hugely worried and protective over her. Due to this they tend to exaggerate any achievement she makes. That's not to say she hasn't achieved anything, She has a good degree and a great job, and is so pretty that she has well over over 20k followers on instagram. However, anything I achieve tends to be glossed over. I'm working towards becoming a nurse and not once have they said they're proud of me. 

My parents whole purpose in life seems to be to ensure that Laura doesn't feel bad due to her condition. When we were younger she could play pranks, push me over or take my things to upset me, and we were ''just playing together'' but if I did something that even slightly annoyed her I would be told off and she would get comforted. This has not changed to this day. 

I have a boyfriend, Matt, who is also an aspiring nurse. Not only did Laura spend a night looking through his pictures on instagram and calling him ugly and other obscenities, but she also propositioned him and offered him to sleep with someone ''who actually looks good''. We told my parents about this and they promised to have a word with her about it but nothing has been done. 

Laura has got a boyfriend of her own now. He is a big, smug, player/bully-type guy named Tom who has tried to intimidate Matt before. Last night at dinner both me and her had too much to drink and she started to prod me, once again calling Matt ugly. She said that the only reason I got with Matt was because I didn't want to be a virgin (which I already wasn't). I was fuming and the alcohol got the better of me, and I responded saying that she only got with that thug because she didn't want to be single when she died in a few years. Laura ran upstairs crying and my mum tried to physically drag me out of the house, though I decided to leave of my own accord. 

I went to Matt's house and am at work now. I regretted the words I said as soon as they came out of my mouth. No matter how many times we've argued I've never once brought up her condition. But at the same time, she has tormented me for so long and I don't want her to be part of my adult life any more. I still want my parents in my life though but they've not contacted me since I was kicked out. 

How do I reach an understanding with my parents while staying away from my toxic sister?

TL;DR: I want my sister who has tormented me out of my life but I don't want to lose my parents. "
"I [22F] made friends with my neighbor [24F], now I kinda hate her. How to handle diplomatically?


A new neighbor moved in right next door to me. We actually share a wall together. Overall, she's pretty sweet, and I made friends with her quickly. In hindsight, I probably shouldn't have gotten cozy with a person I literally can't get away from.

&amp;#x200B;

She constantly has issues - she's a fresh immigrant and is still trying to adjust. I was totally happy to help her at first, mostly helping her learn English and giving her tips about the city. But she wants something from me CONSTANTLY now. She asks to come over, and whenever she does, she'll manage to spend over half an hour complaining about how scared she feels walking home at night (Sydney, Australia - we've got a few bogans but totally safe!). Literally everything terrifies her. I feel like an asshole typing this out, and swear to god - I was so happy to help her as first - but after an hour of her crying and shaking about being asked for a cigarette while walking through a park at night, I kinda just want to smack her.

&amp;#x200B;

Tonight I was studying, and she started banging on my door and crying. I didn't even have enough time to put on my pants before she started screaming for me to help her. You'd think she was being murdered!

&amp;#x200B;

Nope, she found a cockroach in her room. She wanted me to kill it for her. It hid under the floorboards, so she begged for me to stay with her until it came back out. I spent about 20 minutes standing there with a slipper in hand, and whenever I wanted to go back to my apartment she'd start sobbing. I eventually got sick of it, told her she can handle it herself, and went back to mine. She had that ""long live the king"" look of betrayal on her face. I can hear her crying on the phone to her parents right now (she does this nightly. loudly).

&amp;#x200B;

I want to like her, and I get that moving to a new country where you don't speak the language can be scary - but she's meant to be older than me! Am I being an asshole? How do I handle all this?

&amp;#x200B;

tl;dr: my new neighbor is terrified of everything and wants me to baby her. I want to be friends with her but it's really getting on my nerves. How do I navigate this?"
"How do I (29M) deal with my coworkers making fun of me for being married and a dad?


I work at a large tech company around a lot of (age 22-32 years) millennials. Of the group (about 15 or so in my department) i am one of two that is married and has children. the rest of the group are either single or have boyfriends/girlfriends. they spend most of their time out drinking, traveling, going to concerts, etc. my wife and i are happily married and have two children (age 2 and 1). we are typically very fun people, but having two little ones means most of our time is spent doing baby things ( doctor appointments, watching baby cartoons, reading children’s books, baths, bedtime routines). i am becoming the joke of the group for being an “old dad” who “did life backwards”. my coworkers don’t have very positive views on marriage or kids. they see marriage as a joke and an old institution, and kids as a burden. 

i am happy being married and raising two children, but i get angry when i get teased about it. often, they will all go out for drinks after work, but won’t invite me because “i wouldn’t have had a chance to ask my ball and chain”. other times, they will tease my humor as “lame dad humor” or my body as a “dad bod”. if i try and talk about things like money or cars, the response is always “shouldn’t you be buying a minivan instead?” or “don’t you need to save for college?” 

i feel partly guilty because i don’t want to be seen as the old dad of the group. i don’t like the stigma associated with it (King of Queens comes to mind). but i also don’t know how to handle the teasing. should i just accept it and lean into it? should i stop sharing that part of my life with them? should i start working out and traveling to far off places so they finally have another aspect of my life to talk about? i feel like i have less respect because i’ve chosen to have kids. but i’m partly envious of their single, care free lives. what do i do?

tl;dr: I’m the “old dad” of the group, but i don’t want to be. how do i handle the teasing?"
"My mom just messaged me [24m] one year after she kicked me out for being gay and I'm not sure how to proceed.


Hello, my friends. Several months ago I posted in this sub asking for advice on how to deal with an overbearing mother who cannot handle having a gay son. The post is in my history under /r/relationships if you want the background (cant post the url here). I did not give my family my new number so they now infrequently message me via email. Her message is as follows:

""Well I know you don't care but I just wanted to let you know that it has been a year since you sucker-punched the life out of me and our family. Since then I have seen two counselors. The first one was too immature to handle my issues. So I prayed about it and found the most wonderful Christian psychotherapist. I have been diagnosed with PTSD. My physical and mental health have taken such a toll but I am stronger because of it . .  My psychotherapist thinks that only by a miracle of God that I haven't suffered a complete nervous breakdown with all the traumas that I have suffered especially in this past two years [She lost her mom and our house caught fire about a year before that]. My relationship with God has grown even closer and my faith in him will never waiver.. just like I will never stop praying for you and I will never stop loving you. Your lack of compassion is mind-boggling to my psychotherapist. Especially given the field of work that you will go into.. Most of the people in our family love you enough not to keep hitting like on all the disgusting s*** that you post. I personally don't look at it . And I also know that it's a big f*** you mom when you do it . So let's not forget who your real family is. The ones who stand on God's word and want to see you go to heaven and not hell. That's what kills me the most Jacob is that your eternity is on the line here . you want to burn in hell just so you could sleep with Satan [that's how she refers to my boyfriend] that's your choice. There is nothing absolutely nothing you cannot be forgiven for. I love you immensely... and remember we all have to stand before God someday. Everybody misses you and I know that you miss us and you can lie to yourself all you want about that. We were always a close-knit family. So happy anniversary?""

The counsel I received from my last post told me to cut off communicating from my family until they explicitly acknowledged my sexuality and welcomed me back as a gay man. I have done so for the past several months and not responded to my family's emails or social media messages. My first instinct is of course to do the same here because I don't want to start an argument with a brick wall. At the same time, I feel like I should do something to either stop this disrespect from her. I'm kind of at a loss for how to proceed with this. Thank you guys again for your counsel and suggestions.

TL;DR Mom continues to try and put me through a guilt trip one year after she kicked me out for announcing I was in a gay relationship."
"I (25f) used to be a sugar baby. My boyfriend (28m) of three years has always been fine with that, but he was upset to hear most of my sugar daddies were married men




When I got off the phone, George asked me if some of my sugar daddies had been married or in relationships. I said yes, almost all were. It's not like I seeked them out, it's just that most clients of sex workers aren't single. It's just a fact, a lot of the girls I talked to on sugar baby forums had noticed the same thing.

He was really shaken up by that news, I could tell. He asked how I could be okay with that, and I told him the truth, there was a lot about sugaring I wasn't cool with but i grinned and beared it for the money. I didn't care for the faked companionship, the sex, the schmoozing at parties, being surrounded by people who ranged from boring and socially incompetent to gross or nasty. The fact that a guy was married was just one drop in the bucket of things I didn't care for. George said he had never imagined me being the type of person who would screw around with a married man, and I honestly thought that was a pretty arbitrary line to draw considering the kinds of stuff I played along with back then. I told him as much, and he was even more upset I thought it was arbitrary.

I think the more I talked, the more I dug myself into a hole. I tried to say that most people with that level of wealth don't treat friendships and relationships and sex like normal people do. Anything can be bought, in their mind. Relationships aren't often about love as much as they are about image. Friendships aren't often real, they're a whole song and dance to impress the right people. And even without me, I didn't see much of the ""sanctity of marriage"" in these people's lives. 

George told me it sounded like I was trying to rationalize something shitty I did. But I don't see it that way, I was telling the truth about what I saw back then... Anyway we decided to take some time to cool off before we talk again. And I'm kind of stressed about talking about it again. It seems like the more I say, the more I dig myself into a hole. Can I have some advice on how to approach this conversation when we're coming at it with such different points of view?

tl;dr: My boyfriend was cool with the fact that I used to be a sugar baby to get through college. He's not cool with the fact that most of my sugar daddies were married men. I wasn't expecting that this would be a surprise to him, but it is. I need to talk stuff through with my boyfriend."
"My (28F) Boyfriend (27m) who I've started living with won't get his Boiler Fixed and I'm not authorized to fill out the form, its free.


Started living with my boyfriend a month ago, it's great and I love it, but we've hit a bit of a rock. He has his own rented place, I pay him half the rent and help out with shopping, bills and stuff for the house. It's exactly 50/50. His landlord knows I'm living there and is fine with it (in fact he says the house has never looked cleaner lol.)

I went away last weekend with friends, (Thur until Saturday) and got back and the boiler wasn't working. We had no hot water at all. My boyfriend said it had been broken since Friday but he would sort it. Until then we had to have cold showers and boil the kettle for washes.

The cold showers are awful they're so freezing, and I get brain freeze after for ages. I hate it but I have to be clean especially for work. On Monday I asked if he had reported it, he said he'd phoned up but they need him to fill out a form which they've emailed to him. I asked if he wanted me to do it and he said no it has to be him - he's got this online account with the agency. It's all free for my BF as they send someone to fix it.

Come Wednesday I've just text and he still hasn't done it and I feel quite ill from the cold showers. He doesn't shower as much as he works as a mechanic, he showers every 3 days whereas I need to daily or I feel gross.

I don't want to have to keep nagging but I can't live without hot water. I kinda just wanted to rant more than anything as I know the only answer is to keep on at him. But do you think it's okay for any BF/GF to invite someone to live with them, then put off fixing the boiler, watching them struggle with freezing showers each day? Or am I over reacting?

TL;Dr: We have no hot water having to have freezing showers but BF won't fill out the form for the landlord to sort it and it's been almost a week. I can't do it because I'm not authorized.

"Boyfriend (24m) threw out all the furniture he bought with his ex, as a symbol of his commitment to me. (23f) I wish he hadn't, it was wasteful and unnecessary



I am moving into my boyfriend's apartment. Before that, he had his apartment and I had mine. When we decided to move in together, it was an obvious choice to move into his, it's bigger, way nicer than my old one, and apartment hunting in our city sucks so it was easier than finding somewhere new.

Like many young people, his apartment was furnished with hand me downs, stuff from friends, stuff that used to be shared with his ex when they lived together in college. Stuff carried along from old apartments and dorms rather than bought new for his apartment.

We talked about combining our stuff and then throwing out extras, like the extra bed. We'd pick the nicer one to keep, if we had any duplicates. His stuff was generally nicer than mine.

But when I came to start moving in last weekend, I noticed that my boyfriend had already emptied out a lot of his stuff. A sofa gone, tables and shelves gone, a lamp gone, and many more smaller things.

I asked him what was up with that, and he said that he threw out all the stuff that he and his college ex had bought together back when they lived together. He said that it was a ""purge"" of her mark on his life, when I was moving in. He did it for me.

I know he meant that to be sweet or symbolic of making a new life together with just us... But honestly I was upset at how wasteful that was. He didn't even donate anything, just dumped it all in the apartment dumpster. And I was upset we'd have to spend some more money making our home together, he threw out things that would need to be replaced because I didn't have a duplicate. Or he threw out things that were nicer than my things. Like yeah I have a lamp too, but it was $5 from a garage sale and it's hella wobbly. It also was so wasteful to send it all to the dump instead of donating things or giving stuff away to our friends, which I absolutely would have wanted to do if we were getting rid of things together.

It felt so frustrating that he did something so drastic as a symbol of his commitment to me, without even asking if that was what I wanted. I was never bothered by the furniture in his apartment that his ex bought, it was just a sofa, a lamp, a table, shelves, to me. I actually quite liked some of the things, the sofa was amazingly comfortable and I had good memories of movie nights with my boyfriend cuddled up on it. 

So now we've got a shittier apartment setup... I honestly want to tell my boyfriend to replace the stuff he threw out with his own money because it was his idea to dump it all. But I don't know if that'd be unfair because we did talk about buying things together.

tl;dr - My boyfriend threw out furniture he bought with his ex, as a symbol of commitment for me. I wish he hadn't."
"Waitress at my favorite restaurant won’t leave my (32f) baby alone, help me, I’m a social idiot


TLDR: waitress is baby hungry, ruins my meals

In the scope of life this is an absurd issue, but I’m a socially awkward nut and don’t know how to handle this with grace. 

My husband and I frequent a certain restaurant. We go probably monthly. We have an adorable 8 month old baby girl who is along for the ride.

There is a certain young waitress who is very sweet and lovely, but she doesn’t know when to quit with the baby. She comes over constantly, it interrupts my meal because I feel weird eating with someone literally squatting next to me, often asking questions about the baby. It’s just one of my social hangups that I don’t generally like to eat with strangers focused on me. I’m one of those people who stop eating to speak to the waitress, is just how I roll.

 In an hour and a half of being there, she is probably hovering at least 45 minutes spread over many few minute long intervals. I will finally have her go away and get some food in my mouth and she is back gooing at the baby before I swallow. It really ruins the flow and experience of my meal and I find by the end I hardly even enjoyed it or focused on it because I was so busy dealing with the baby and waitress.

Left without constant stimuli, the baby will eat the food I bring and then get focused on a toy or something and I can eat in peace. But with constant interaction, she can’t get in her own groove and I have to be ON the whole time for the baby too when the waitress goes away, or The baby gets mildly stressed over it sometimes which she also doesn’t pick up on, she is at the height of stranger anxiety and looks to me for approval so I smile and say it’s ok and eventually she warms up but this is just annoying for me to deal with.

My husband said let’s go there this weekend and I got a wave of agitation already anticipating it being the same. On one hand we can elect not to go there obviously, in the other hand it’s our favorite restaurant and I’d like to eat the food there. But I’d like to figure out how to politely get the message across.. of course sure come say hi and maybe one five minute stint of interacting with the baby is fine, but the usual routine is not a nice experience. And I feel as an adult human I should learn how to assert myself politely without agitating for two days over the feelings of a waitress, so fire away."
"Had a “real” conversation with my(28M) Dad(55M) for the first time ever and now I’m feeling incredibly insecure about my marriage


My dad and I have never had a real( talking about our feelings) conversation. We talked about stupid kids shit until I was 14 and then we talked about sports until yesterday. My mom has always been the one I went to when I needed to vent or talk about life etc. 

My mom and my dad got divorced when I was ten and I never really felt like it was my place to ask the why and what’s of it. My assumption was always that it was mutual or they just sort of fell out of love with each other. They never fought in front of me or my sister so I never knew it was an issue until they started sleeping in separate rooms near the end.

Yesterday I went over his house to help him get his yard equipment ready for spring and we were talking about all the normal shit (baseball, offseason developments for our football teams) when my mom came up. He was bitter for a few years after the divorce but he’s not had an unkind word since. He sat at the same table as her at my wedding and has been always respectful to her and her family as well as welcoming to my wife(26F) since she was my girlfriend 5 years ago. 

I ,for reasons I can’t even understand , finally asked what went wrong. 

He seemed really caught off guard by the question and since that’s not how we interact I don’t blame him but after a few moments of silence he said he still really isn’t sure 18 years later. He said he thought he had a happy marriage and one day my mom just kind of said she wasn’t happy and that she felt alone etc. they tried couples counseling briefly but they separated and divorced shortly there after and if she had never said anything he’d still be married to her today because he thought it was going well. 

The whole car ride back from his house all I could think about was how I think I’m happily married and that I think I’m meeting my wife’s needs but she has all these inner thoughts I don’t get to see and if she was unhappy how would I fix it. It’s really fucking me up. I always try to give my wife my absolute best (I do plenty around the house, cook most nights, talk to her about my feelings and listen to her about hers and offer support) but now I’m just terrified that one day she’s going to wake up unhappy and I’m going to have nothing I can do about it. Since my parents are divorced I told my my wife back when we were just dating that marriage is something I see as an absolute lifetime commitment and she felt the same and that unless there was abuse or infidelity all problems are something that we need to work out. I love her more than anything and I consider my marriage the center of my life and I hope our lives. I just can’t imagine a day in my life without her as my life partner. I just want to go back to feeling as secure as I did two days ago.

Tl;dr my dad and I talked about our feelings for the first time ever found out he still isn’t sure what went wrong with his marriage 18 years later and now I feel insecure about my own despite having no reason to.

"My girlfriend (24F) had a bad experience with sex when she was young. I (23M) have tried to be supportive, but now I am worried that I can't do it.


So, this is a throwaway. 

&amp;#x200B;

Me and my girlfriend have been together for around 3 years. During this time we have had an amazing time together. I really love her a lot and spending time with her is just absolutely amazing. In the time we have been together we have tried a few time to have sex, but right as we are close to doing it she backs away. This comes from a really bad experience that she had when she was younger - around 16yo - with a former SO. 

&amp;#x200B;

I have no idea what the bad experience was since she doesn't really like to talk about it, and I don't think I should pressure her in any way to talk about it. She has expressed multiple times she wants to go see a psychologist  to talk about it, but has never really started looking for one - mostly for money reasons. I really wish I could help her a little bit more, but can't without her feeling like I'm pressuring her. We have really good communication when it comes to anything else, but this topic has been a real outlier in our usual conversation tactics. 

&amp;#x200B;

The reason I am writing this post is to maybe bent a little bit lol. I have expressed to her that while I really want to be supportive, but would like to eventually start having sex. Like I said we have tried a number of times and at this point I kind of feel like its not going to happen. I really don't like the idea of leaving her because of something like this, because I feel like a douchebag leaving someone for not having sex. But after 3 years of abstinence I really miss it a lot. And have even had open conversations with her about this, but they don't really lead anywhere. I guess I just don't know what to do. 

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR - Girlfriend had a bad experience with sex when she was younger and it resulted in us not having sex. After 3 years of not having sex I am starting to think that maybe I can't handle this type of relationship."
"My girlfriend came to where I work to ask for condoms so she could have sex with someone else!


TL;DR at bottom

Ugh what a day I've had. So, some context. I'm in college right now and recently started work at my dorm's front desk a few weeks back. My university has condom ""dispensers"" in every bathroom, which they have there in order to encourage students to practice safe sex- there's a diagram of how to put it on and everything, it's actually quite funny haha.

Anyway, there's a message on the dispenser that says to ask the front desk to refill the condoms if they run out. Now, they've been completely empty a few times throughout the year, but no one has ever asked me to refill them- when I walk into the bathroom and see the dispenser is empty I refill it anyway because I get it- it's difficult for a college student to summon the courage to come to the front desk and asking to refill the condom dispenser. Even though there's not much to it, i can just imagine that would be all kinds of awkward haha. At least that's what I thought until yesterday.

So, I work the front desk on Tuesdays and Thursdays from 8 PM- midnight. Anyway, it's about 11:40 ish and I'm getting ready to close up for the night (I have the last shift during the weekdays). As I'm making sure all the packages for the dorm residents are in order for them to pick in the morning, I hear a girl and guy's laughter bust through one of the doors (There are two residential wings behind the front desk location, so I couldn't see who at the moment), but the girl's voice sounded VERY familiar. Anyway, I'm bending down (so my face isn't visible) and arranging the packages on the floor when I hear a ""excuse me, but they're out of condoms in the bathroom,"" followsd by a giggle that I would recognize anywhere. It was my GIRLFRIEND. Now, my gf knew I worked the front desk, but as I only started work recently, she must have forgotten what my shift was.

In shock, I stood up and turned around, and there she is wearing BOOTY SHORTS AND A BRA, with this guy standing next to her. Both of us were completely in shock, and the guy as he saw me slowly inched away from the desk as I went into the adjacent cupboard, grabbed a handful of condoms, placed them in front her, and shut the window and turned out the lights. She must have felt bad, as she was pouring on the glass saying my name over and over again apolgoizing and saying how she messed up, and she just wanted to talk to me, she loves me, all the standard bs that accompanies a SO cheating on you. I've missed 9 calls from her today so far and am ignoring all her texts. I have no idea who the guy is, no idea how long this has been going on, no idea if she's slept with him already (we were saving ourselves for each other), or anything. Quite frankly, I don't want to know. I'm just heartbroken and don't know what to do. Part of me wants to forgive her because I care for her so much but another part of me is so enraged that I can't think straight. This only happnened last night, and I don't think I've had enough time to process yet. I'm so lost and confused. Please help.

TL;DR- My gf came up to the front desk where I work (not knowing I work there) to ask for condoms so she could have sex with another guy. Struggling on where to go from here. "
"My boyfriend[21M] disheartened me[20F] about my biggest future dreams


I was born to an artist family and both my younger sister and I were raised to be artists. It's the main thing about me, it's my passion, it's the thing all my future dreams are made of. And almost everyone around me know how I'm so into art. And my biggest dream ever, is to have my art in my own exhibiton. To be able to create a gallery or something like that, one day. I'd sell my soul for it.

&amp;#x200B;

My boyfriend knew both my sister and I drew. But only today he wondered what her style was. I told him that she was kind of better than me. He wanted to see her art and I showed him some of her best pieces. 

&amp;#x200B;

He really liked it. He said that he didn't expect her to be so talented at such a young age. And he said that she was really at least thirty times better than me.

He said: ""Maybe you should leave the exhibition thing to her. Meanwhile you could just help her with her exhibition.""

&amp;#x200B;

I tried not to show that I felt down and just laughed and said: ""Yeah! It's something we've been planning to do together, anyways! We can both work on it and have OUR exhibition.""

&amp;#x200B;

Then he said that she would definitely make more money than me so he suggested that maybe I should do something else. And at that point, I was so disappointed and disheartened that I couldn't keep talking anymore. I was about to cry.

He realized that and started asking me why I was feeling bad, that he was just being honest and I had many other areas I was so good at. 

&amp;#x200B;

But it was honestly too horrible to hear someone I love and care for crashing my hopes and dreams and I've been crying for an hour now. But I am mad at myself for crying, too because I know I shouldn't be crying for what others tell me about my biggest dreams. I can do it anyways, as long as I believe in myself, I don't need anyone to believe in me.

&amp;#x200B;

But it was his disbelief in me that broke my heart this much. He is usually too upfront and will say whatever he thinks. But I'm now angry because he couldn't respect me and be a little more sensitive about my feelings. He is also into music and he is at the very beginning yet but I always try to keep his motivation up by asking him to show me his work and then I encourage him to do more of it. I find him very talented, but while there may be people who are a lot more talented than him, I never told him that directly. 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm sad he couldnt be tender enough. And even though everything else about our relationship is right, I cannot help but think his too honest words may harm us a lot in the future. So maybe it's a lot better to end it, because of just this.

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR I showed my bf my younger sister's artwork. He said hers was a lot better than mine and he said I should leave it to her, or maybe I could just help her to achieve my dreams."
"Guy [29m] I'm [26f] dating seemingly ghosted me after we had sex for the first time, and he revealed something tragic that happened to him. What should I do?


We met on a shopping mall. He chatted me up about what I was reading and then asked me for coffee. We went on 5 dates and on the 5th we went to his home and had sex, which was really, really good.

After sex he lied beside me and started crying increasingly harder. I held him for a few minutes until he said his mom and sister died on an accident, and now he's left only with his dad (it happened 2 months ago). I held him several minutes until he stopped crying. I hugged him tight and told him it was alright.

After that, we ate something, talked and laughed a bit and slept together cuddling. Despite the tragedy I felt very close to him and I enjoyed the intimacy very much. I left early to have time to go home and to work. He hugged me and said thank you before I left.

And then nothing. He hasn't texted or replied to me in 3 days.

I've been ghosted before but this one hurts a lot more. I was really liking him a lot. He's very kind and educated and we seem like we could have a shot at being together, but now I don't know.

I mean I know where he lives but it would probably be wrong to go unprompted, especially if he actually is ghosting me, right? I'm feeling crazy just by the fact than I'm considering it.

What should I do?

**tl;dr:** I dated a guy that apparently ghosted me after we had sex one time and he cried profusely because he revealed his sister and mom died in an accident 2 months ago. I consoled him and we spent an otherwise wonderful night together but then he dropped off the radar completely. What should I do?"
"I [38M] just found out an old ex [35M] has been stalking me for 15 years.


I feel most comfortable posting this here. 



Jeff and I dated way back in my early 20s and we broke it off right around 2004. He was emotionally unstable and our relationship was toxic, I was his first everything and he was very overattached. I had completely forgotten about him and have since moved across country, and have been married to my womderful husband Bradley for what will be a decade this May. About a year ago I remember now I was in the store and I saw a man with an empty cart staring at me, and when I noticed, he slowly walked away. It just gave me an eerie feeling because I felt like I knew him but I couldn’t place him. After that, I noticed little things like that, sometimes I’d be jogging and I’d see someone really far away facing me and I would get the feeling I was being stared at. 





Anyway, I was friend requested on facebook by a guy I knew back in college, who was friends with Jeff as well. He asked me if he could call me, I said alright, and he did. He informed me that he got back in touch with Jeff, and found out something very disturbing. Ever since our break up in 2004ish, Jeff has been stalking me. He would keep track of what I would do, religiously stalking me online, and he tracked down where I moved to and saved up money to move nearby several years ago. He said that he coaxed this information out of Jeff, and that now Jeff’s life revolves around watching mine unfold. That he follows me almost everywhere and watches from a distance and stalks me on all my social media with a litany of fake accounts. I don’t know which are real and which aren’t. 




I feel extremely paranoid now and I don’t know what to do. It feels like my world is dissolving. I haven’t even told my husband, I’m extremely anxious about this and I just don’t know what I can do. 







tl;dr My ex from a decade and a a half ago moved to my town and has been stalking me for years and I don’t know what I can do about this."
"My (22F) boyfriend (22M) has been acting awkward around me ever since finding my erotic fan fiction


Jfc this is an embarrassing post. 

My bf John and I have been together for two months and we are not sexually active because I asked him if we could take things slow. I’m a virgin and I don’t want to lose it until I’m sure of the relationship. He has had two girlfriends before me and was sexually active with both of them.

Anyway, he accidentally stumbled upon my fan fiction and I’m so embarrassed that I could just go yeet myself into the ocean and float away. I don’t think he actually read a lot of it but it was pretty clear what it was. I’ve written way too much of this shit. What can I say, I’m 22 and choosing not to have sex, so I gotta have an outlet somewhere. I’m not sure how much he saw or how much he read, but there’s some crazy shit in there. Some of it is pretty normal but I’ve also written stuff delving into bdsm, non-consensual sex, weird no gravity space sex, people finding alternate uses for lightsaber hilts, *you get the idea*.

I think my boyfriend was almost as embarrassed about it as I was, although I was rightfully mortified. Ever since he’s been acting weird. He’s not as cuddly and he seems kind of offput, and when I tried to ask him what exactly he read he went bright red and refused to answer. I didn’t press but I did remind him that what I wrote is 100% fantasy and it doesn’t mean I’m going to expect anything weird from him, but he just got even more awkward and changed the subject.

I have no clue what he could be thinking or how to broach the subject, and to top it all off I’d like to avoid talking about it just as much as he does because *dear God it’s so fucking embarrassing*. What could he be thinking? How do I even approach this? 

Tl;dr: my boyfriend of two months found my weird erotic fan fiction and now he’s acting weird and I don’t know how to approach the situation"
"I (34F) went to a party where an acquaintance (30sF) made a mean comment about my appearance. Suddenly other people chimed in and it seems everyone thinks this way, and now I don’t trust anyone.


TL;DR: At a party, a girl made a comment that I looked old. Everyone around starting chiming in agreeing, and now I’m self conscious about my appearance, and I don’t want anything to do with anyone.

Before I start I should let you all know that I care about my appearance, a lot. Not in a vain way, but I lost a lot of weight a few years ago, and I worked hard at it for over a year, and I’m proud of it. And I think I look good, if I do say so myself. My body looks great, and I wear somewhat revealing clothes, and I also tan frequently. 

Last weekend, I went to a party where there were a bunch of family and friends. Someone I haven’t seen in awhile commented that I looked good, and couldn’t believe how much I had changed since I saw them last. Another girl that I barely know chimed in “yeah, but she looks so old, ha ha.” 

I turned around and said “what?” expecting that she had not said that or that she meant something else, but, no. She repeated that she thought I looked old, much older than I actually am, and that tanning beds are doing me no favors. Someone else chimed in agreeing, and this started a discussion about tanning beds and how they age you, and how everyone just thought I knew how I looked since I look in the mirror everyday. In this entire group of people I thought were friends and family, no one chimed in and defended me, or said anything nice about me at all. I brushed it off at the time, but ever since then, all I can think about is how everyone around me has betrayed me, even people that have told me I look amazing since my weight loss. I don’t want to be around anyone anymore, and I don’t know how to get over it."
"My [25F] husband [25M] keeps talking to his family in my presence about how much he regrets our wedding and he also keeps making comments about our credit card debt, despite my multiple requests for him to stop doing this.


My husband and I got married last year. It was important to me, my parents, and my mother-in-law that we have a nice, formal wedding. While my parents paid a large amount and his mom and dad and step-mom chipped in as well, my husband and I charged a lot of things on our end that we were expected to cover: our honeymoon (which he has never once said he regretted and he never complains about), our honeymoon excursions, getaway car, random but necessary decor items (guestbook, signs, poloroid cameras for guestbook, sparklers, etc). Some things we paid off: we used our tax return to pay off the florist in full because she would only take cash or check, and we paid off my husband's wedding band in monthly payments for a year and a half.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

But still, a lot of credit card debt was racked up on various items (mostly decor) that my parents wouldn't cover and I didn't have the courage to ask his parents for help covering. My parents paid for the venue, food, DJ, my wedding dress, some tux rentals, a bridesmaid's dress (who is my SIL), the flower girls' dresses (my nieces), and some other things. His parents covered the photography (arguably the largest expense after the venue and food), videography, rehearsal dinner, and some other small stuff.

&amp;#x200B;

  
My husband, to this day, holds a grudge against me for the credit card debt. After the wedding, we racked up some more just due to a need to survive. I was only working part-time and it was hard surviving on my part-time job and his full-time job with the credit card debt we already had. We also ate out a lot more than we should have. It wasn't all just due to the wedding, although a lot of it is...Anyway, the fact is, we are under credit card debt. Plain and simple. My parents are suspicious of it but don't really ask and we don't bring it up around them, because my husband is scared of them and I don't want to hear their opinions. We barely see his dad and step-mom so they don't really have any clue. We see his mom and brother and grandmother a lot, and my husband will always manage to slip in a passive aggressive comment about our credit card debt.

&amp;#x200B;

These are some things he has said around his mom, brother, and grandmother:

&amp;#x200B;

One time I was talking to his cousin's fiancé (in the presence of his mother, brother, and grandmother) about Etsy. My husband came up and said, ""Oh you LOOOVE your Etsy, still paying for it today!"" He passes it off with a smirk but it's passive aggressive.

&amp;#x200B;

Or someone will talk about money and he'll say ""I wish I had a million dollars. Hell, I wish I had a hundred dollars! That would help me out greatly!""

&amp;#x200B;

His brother is single and still lives at home and has saved up twenty grand. My husband will say to his brother, ""Hey, wanna loan me some money? I could use it!"" His brother will sometimes say, ""I'm richer than you'll ever be!"" or ""Everyone is richer than you'll ever be!"" My husband has said that too... ""Everyone is richer than me!"" and ""You are richer than I'll ever be!""

&amp;#x200B;

Tonight, the topic of weddings came up. His brother will always say he hates weddings and doesn't get why people don't just get married in public parks and have cheap, simple affairs. I always remind him that he LOVED our wedding. He got drunk and begged his mom to let him go bar-hopping after it ended with the other groomsmen. He was overheard saying ""Please Mom, this is the best night of my life and a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity!""

&amp;#x200B;

His brother will tell me that while he did enjoy our wedding, he wouldn't have one like it. Then tonight, when he was going on about that, my husband said ""I wouldn't either"".

&amp;#x200B;

I looked at him and said ""You regret our wedding?""

&amp;#x200B;

And he just smiled at me sadly, as if he didn't want to tell me. His mom said ""No he didn't.""

&amp;#x200B;

I pushed on and said, ""You told me it was the best day of your life.""

  
""Well, yeah it was, but let's just say I wouldn't have spent as much as we did.""

&amp;#x200B;

His brother then said ""It was hard on the wallet""

&amp;#x200B;

My husband said ""Yeah it was hard on the wallet. We're still paying for it now!""

&amp;#x200B;

  
Tonight when we got home, I tried my hardest to drop it and to pick my battles - believe me, I tried. But I have been asking my husband for MONTHS now to PLEASE STOP making these comments about our finances in front of his family. If he doesn't make those comments in front of my family or his dad and step-mom, I don't understand why he thinks it's okay to do it in front of his brother and mother and grandmother. It embarrasses me and frankly, it's none of their business how much debt we have or don't have. I have asked him in the past if he told his mom exactly how much or if he flat-out told her ""We have credit card debt from the wedding"" and he denied it ... but I don't know if I believe him anymore, because everytime he makes these comments, they don't act surprised. They agree or just look at us knowingly.

&amp;#x200B;

It bothered me so much tonight that I couldn't take it. I approached him in the family room where he was watching TV and asked him, ""Do you really regret our wedding?""

&amp;#x200B;

He replied by rolling his eyes. ""Not now. I know you're on your period, but not tonight. I'm relaxing.""  


  
""It just really hurt my feelings when you said that,"" I said. ""I thought it was the best day of your life. It was the best day of mine.""

&amp;#x200B;

""I'm going to leave,"" he told me. ""If you keep going on, I'm going to leave."" 

&amp;#x200B;

I then asked him, ""Okay but please stop making comments about our credit card debt in front of your family. I have asked you multiple times to stop, and yet you still keep doing it. Please stop it. Please.""

&amp;#x200B;

""Yeah okay whatever you're right."" He said.

&amp;#x200B;

""Are you listening?"" I asked.

&amp;#x200B;

""I'm fucking leaving."" He stood up, shirtless in his underwear, grabbed his car keys and went to get his coat and acted like he was going outside. I heard the dog scratching and I went to make sure he wasn't taking her with him. He said he was going to take her outside and when I said I would, he then stomped back into the house and told me to ""Leave him the fuck alone."" And made some comment about my period.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Yes, I'm on my period. But this isn't why I'm upset. I'm upset because our wedding was the best day of my life and he treats it's memory like shit. All he sees are dollar signs wasted. Funny, he doesn't view our honeymoon in that light even though we charged the entire honeymoon on a card. The wedding was at least mostly paid off.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm also upset because he won't listen to my pleas and requests to stop making comments about our debt. It embarrasses me. I feel like he's complained behind my back and blamed the debt on me. I don't know, I just don't like it. I don't want to talk about our finances in front of his mother or brother or grandmother anymore. I'm also sick of his brother talking about how weddings are a waste of money but it's not my place to ask him to stop.

&amp;#x200B;

What do I do? I'm sitting here crying in our bedroom because I just don't know what to do anymore. Do I just suffer in silence, let him rake me over the coals until the debt is paid and hopefully he forgives me?

&amp;#x200B;

\*\*tl;dr My husband won't stop making passive aggressive comments about our credit card debt to his mom, brother, and grandma. He also won't stop insulting our wedding day. He knows both these things hurt me but he continues to do it. I don't know what to do anymore. Approaching him about it means he insults me, cusses at me, and threatens to leave the house. Sometimes he actually does leave and drive away. What do I do? Do I just suffer in silence until the debt is paid and hopefully he forgives me?\*\*"
"My (27F) roommate (28F) won't pay her bills. She's also my best friend. What do I do?


My roommate is my best friend (of like 10 years)! We moved into an apartment together last July, and for the most part everything's going well. 

The set up is: she pays the rent (and then I pay her back every month) and I pay all the utilities (and she pays me back every month). The problem is the past few months she just hasn't paid anything, and hasn't said a word about it. One of the bills was large so I said she could pay it back to me in instalments if she wanted, but she hasn't even done that.

I'm not super rich so I can't afford to keep covering her, and she owes me about $150 now, which, if she doesn't pay me back still, will rise to about $800 by the summer because of some stupid tax bill. 

She's my best friend, and she complains almost daily about being broke, so I feel awful about asking for money from her. She doesn't have the best paying job but neither do I, and it's starting to worry me now that I'll never get that money back.

Oh and also, I have clinical anxiety, so please factor that into your advice, it's really hard for me to say to someone ""we need to talk"" and then have a big talk. This whole situation is actually giving me a lot of extra panics. 

Thank you so much for your advice, anything is appreciated because I don't want to upset her or change our relationship, I just really need the money back.

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR: My roommate owes me a lot of money and I need advice about how to sensitively ask for it back."
"My [27F] dad [65M] made some over-sexualized comments about my sister and I don't know how to proceed with our relationship.


I love my father, but he has a history of making sexually suggestive comments towards women that make me feel uncomfortable. He made a rather extreme one several years ago, I got upset at him, and he hasn't made one since. He does, however, sometimes make weird comments about my ""figure"" but I just let those slide.

The other day my older sister announced her pregnancy. He said, ""Your tits are going to get huge."" I wasn't there but heard about it from my mom.

The same older sister texted my mother asking what she should do since her 11 year old son asked her what a dildo was. My father brought up the dildo question to my 11 year old nephew in an inappropriate context.

I love my father, but I don't even want to see him right now after the comment he made about my sisters breasts. I feel so uncomfortable. I haven't seen him or responded to his text messages in two weeks, and I have no idea how to move forward. I barely am speaking to my mother right now because I don't want it to seem like I am only talking to one parent.

Does anyone have any advice whatsoever? I am at a loss. I don't know what to do.

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR: My father makes overly sexualized comments about me and my sisters bodies and I don't know how to handle my resentment towards it. I have tried explaining to him before that it makes me uncomfortable but he doesn't seem to get it."
"My [28F] friends are pressuring me and my boyfriend [23M] about my pregnancy.


Hi all. 

I have been with my boyfriend Imran for four years. He is of Bangladeshi origin but born and raised in England and I am White English. I am an accountant and he is a a railway track maintainer. I was a little apprehensive about the small age gap since he was only 19 when he asked me out but he proved on the first date and every day since that he's the best man I've ever known. We moved in together last year into a lovely apartment. 

On the subject of children, since we are both financially stable and could afford to provide for a baby, we made the decision that we shouldn't necessarily try, but we shouldn't *not* try either. I found out last week that I was pregnant and we are both delighted. 

I went for a meal with my friends yesterday afternoon where I told them the good news. Everyone was happy for me, but one question was asked by several of them:

&gt; Are you going to get married before the baby comes?

They seemed a little disappointed when I told them that we had no plans to, and quite a few of them urged me to consider it. Bear in mind that all but all but one of the friends that were there are White English (so nobody comes from a culture with a huge emphasis on marriage) and none of them are particularly traditional or religious, so this was surprising for me. 

Myself and all of my friends come from a background most people would call ''middle class'', and one of my friends, Jade [26F] said that having a child out of wedlock is ''chavvy'' something which I think is snobby and unfair to say. Most of the afternoon was spent with them ''lightly'' suggesting that we marry before the baby is born. 

Now, Imran does in fact have very personal reasons for why he wants a child before we marry. He comes from a very traditional and religious Muslim family, and while he has nothing against how anybody else chooses to live their lives, he personally does not like religion or tradition, and has wanted to live his life his own way. He doesn't want us to get married for no other reason than ''because it's the done thing'', and has always said that he wanted at least one child before the question of marriage comes up. However, he has made absolutely clear that we will get married eventually, since it's something that I've always wanted. It's just not something that we've agreed not to prioritise at the moment. 

Like a lot of girls I always dreamt of a fairytale wedding. However, I completely understand Imran's reasons for wanting to do things a bit differently. And in fact the idea of our child being at our wedding makes it seem even more special, so I am willing to wait for that special day and see no need to hurry. My parents have been very supportive and his eventually came around. However, I am somewhat baffled by my friend's reactions. I was texting on the groupchat last night when Imran was asleep and some of my girls were implying that Imran doesn't value me since he doesn't view marriage as important. Jade said that he was afraid if commitment, even though he has been with me for four years, and pays half the rent in a home that's in my name (since I'm the bigger earner). I have explained his reasons to them but they're not buying it. 

I have put the chat on mute for the time being and haven't told Imran any of this since I don't want him to see me upset for something so petty. Should I have a tell him about what my friends have been saying or should I try to sort this out on my own terms? 

TL;DR: My friends have been acting judgemental towards me and my SO since they learned that we have no plans to marry before our baby is born. "
"I [26F] don’t know how to handle my disrespectful mother [59F].


My mother has always had mood swings since I can remember. She also always acts as if she has a „right“ to things, especially when it comes to close family. I moved out 5 months ago, and now the way she acts seems so extreme. It made me notice how bad she treats me because I gained some distance. Here’s an example from a week ago, at my aunts birthday: 

She called me at work a few hours before the party and tells me she is going to gift my aunt the Christmas present i got for her, because she doesn’t like it. I was a bit speechless, but said okay. I also told her that me and my boyfriend got a flowerbouqet for my aunt. My mother then started acting offended and asked why we would do that and how one needs to „keep in mind the overall value“ of the present and that she didn’t want to spend more than 30€ on a present. That means she googled the worth of the Christmas present I got for her, since that was exactly how much it cost!

 I asked why my aunt shouldn’t get more than 1 present and that the flowers were from me and my boyfriend. She kept making comments about it so I ended the call...

Then at the birthday party, I told my uncle how I gained weight in muscle since doing more sports to which she replied that she already knew I had gotten fatter when she saw me. Later she saw the flowers for my aunt and stood up to look at them. She came back and looked at me in a shaming way, saying she had never gotten such nice flowers from me, which is untrue. I am already afraid to give anything to her because she insulted me on more than one occasion because the present wasn’t good enough. She even burst out crying blaming me once because of a present. And this time she gave away my present to her and demanded money instead, because „she didn’t get anything for Christmas now!“.  

Later that evening she demanded to get an appointment at my studio ASAP. When I told her I was booked til July, she got angry and refused to wait that long. She wanted to get in NOW and that it would be „the least I could do for raising me and for the pregnancy her body had to go through.“. I didn’t know what to say.

I invited everyone for dinner soon and she also complained how far she has to drive to the restaurant and how she didn’t like anything on the menu when she looked it up online. I wish I could uninvite her already!

One more thing that happened while I was moving is that she took a gold ring out of my closet, which she gave to me once, because she was mad at me for moving out. She took it without telling me...

Sorry if this is badly written. I think I already know I probably have to cut ties for this to stop, but I always get the feeling it is my fault somehow. What do you think?

TLDR: mother disrespects and insults me constantly, still expects me to jump for her at every call."
"My (38F) husband (37M) acts one way and says something opposite... Has anyone else experienced this...?


We’ve been married almost 10 years. We have kids.

(I’m in therapy. I go weekly.)

Husband will go days without speaking to me other than general questions or comments “Do we have mayo?” “Where is the ___?•”

He ignores my texts regarding anything serious or me trying to talk to him.

He doesn’t interact with me, he doesn’t try to spend time with me. We just co exist. I am going non stop trying to take care of the house, kids, animals, myself, my business, dinner, cleaning... And he walks in and goes straight to the couch and gets on his phone. Every night. No offer to help. Doesn’t help with parenting. Doesn’t help clean up after dinner.

I’ve done everything I know to do. I’ve said everything I know to say. I’ve asked everything I know to ask.

I texted him a few nights ago and asked if he wanted to be married and he said yes. But we haven’t spoken in person in 2 days...

Has anyone experienced anything like this?

I really don’t know what to do.

TL;DR Husband says he wants to be married but doesn’t interact with me or acknowledge me."
"Bf is commanding on things I shouldn't do.


Hi all

I'm 22F and live together with 24m. Together for a year and things go good. 

The problem is that he can be very commanding. 
A few examples:

I'm trying to do something (cooking, cleaning etc) and he just says dont do that.  I ask why not and he'll just explain that I need to do it differently. 

Just tonight I wanted to have some cola. He stood up to get drinks.  He got me water.  I asked why no cola.  He says you can also just have water.  No explanation. 

I get some cola myself and drank it. He said no cola before bed.

I had my bunny out to run.  He said put him back in the cage. He poops and clearly isn't toilet trained (first week here,  9 weeks old)

He just came to me like a zombie and licked my neck. That's your romantic moment for the evening. Sad thing is that it's true.


I don't know what to do with this? I can talk about it with him but every time negative criticism will come over as blaming. 

TL;DR boyfriend tells me a lot what not to do when it's my own responsibility.  I'm old enough? What to do"
"My partner (42F), is a bridezilla and is making me (34F) regret proposing.


We have been dated 4 years.
When I first met her, she had a job in a call center. It wasn't great, but it brought in money. I knew that she wasn't happy, and it was far from her ""dream"" job, so when she said she wanted to stop I had to complaints.
I proposed 8 months ago, with a wedding date set for this August. 
She asked if she could drop down to part time to plan the wedding.
I have a very good job so I said yes, I can cover bills and have a fair amount in savings.
About 2 months ago she went to a wedding dress convention, while there she signed up to ""win"" a pamper day, and this is where the problems started. 
She won the pamper day, and while there decided to sign up for Mary Kay.
I'm a pretty relaxed person so I was like okay enjoy it.
It became her whole life very fast, she quit doing part time so she could sell Mary Kay full time.
We'd booked a large hall for the after party of the wedding.
I found out about 2 hours ago that we won't be having a family party, but instead a seller of another home product, which she met at a craft fair, suggested she use the wedding as a craft fair, so she can sell while in her dress.
So the big wedding hall I booked is now apparently a massive meet up full of local women who sell items from their home. 
Basically, a massive craft fair.
Lots have agreed to do it apparently.
Not even homemade items just Mary Kay related stuff. There's even 2 selling the same lipstick?
I am NOT okay about this, and told her no.
She sulked and sat at her phone for a while, then comes and tells me
""You're not supporting my business"", I tell her I am, just not my wedding party as a large sale party.
She starts shouting how I'm keeping my friends from buying from her.
She screamed a lot.
I honestly have no idea what to do. I'm so tempted to call of the wedding. The entire wedding has became about her business.
I am a professional, my work mates will be coming, as will both our families. It feels wrong to me to tell them that this is our wedding, when really it's a bunch of people trying to sell them stuff.

I honestly have no idea what to do.
I love her. How can I show her that this is just not okay?
I feel like everything I say to her, there is 4 women on Facebook telling her that I'm not being supportive or to not listen to me, and for some reason she listens to them.
I want to support her business, but I've wanted a dream wedding for years and ber craft fair just isn't what I want.

To top it all off this was supposed to be a way for her to make some extra cash towards the wedding, but so far nothing has come in.

Should I tell her I won't get married if my wedding is turned into a craft fair? 

TLDR: Partner wants to turn wedding into a selling day, and won't listen to me.
I'm spending the night at my sister's because I don't want to be screamed at any more.

"My (39F) husband (46M) has suddenly grown very close to his boss (50-something F)


My husband of 15 years got a new boss at work about 9 months ago, and their relationship was civil but strained thanks to some unpleasant office politics.

In February, the two of them (along with the rest of the department's senior leadership) headed to a big industry conference on the other side of the country, and he hoped the trip would help solidify their relationship-- he wanted them to work better together and didn't feel like he had her ear or her trust. They went on the trip and I barely heard from him the entire time. I received one phone call in five days, lasting under five minutes, in which he told me he was attending sessions all day and ""networking events"" all night (read: drinking from 3 p.m. until the wee hours of the morning). I didn't love that we weren't able to stay in touch more, but I told myself it was just the circumstances of the conference and I should suck it up and wait the five days to have him back.

He came back feeling much better about things, saying they talked at length and had breakthroughs about how they are communicating and aligning their efforts. They have been in near-constant contact ever since. They text each other every day, morning to night, about all manner of things work-related and not-- when he's not on his phone, he's frequently chatting with her on Facebook Messenger. They ""meet for happy hour"" at least once a week, which entails him telling me he's ""going to get a drink"" with her and then not coming home until after midnight. The first few times it happened, I expressed my unhappiness with the late hour in the middle of a work week, and he apologized and told me he'd finally had the conversation he needed to have with her about work and it wouldn't happen again. It has happened at least once every week for the past two months.

I finally expressed that I didn't think it was appropriate for him to have this kind of relationship with any woman, much less his boss. I told him I have no problem with him going to happy hour with her if it falls within the bounds of what happy hour is generally understood to be-- a drink or two after work, usually done in time for everyone to get home for dinner-- but that texting me at 7 p.m. saying ""I'm at Bar X and I'll be leaving soon"" and then going dark on me for five hours while he's out getting hammered with his boss is not a situation I'm comfortable with. While he was initially apologetic, he has gradually begun to react as if I'm being unreasonably jealous and controlling. He doesn't see anything wrong with texting her as much as he does, as he feels sorry for her since she's going through a divorce and generally having a rough time in both her personal and professional life. I don't believe it's his place to be that sort of friend to her.

While I don't think he's sleeping with her, I still feel as if I'm being cheated on in some manner (and they have definitely had ample opportunity to take things physical if they were so inclined). Being treated like I'm overreacting, being told it won't happen again and then seeing the promise broken, is making me feel insecure, irrational, and uncomfortably suspicious. I have a hard time believing him now when he tells me he won't be out long, and I immediately get anxious when he says he's meeting his boss after work. His irritation at my unhappiness is making me question my perspective-- am I off-base here? Are my objections unreasonable? And if I'm NOT crazy, how do I deal with this? I'm at a loss as to how to handle the situation productively when he honestly seems to think there's nothing going on that should concern me.

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR: I think my husband's relationship with his boss is unprofessionally familiar and boderline-cheating; he disagrees."
"I (33F) had my breast implants out and I'm not sure my husband (35M) likes them. How can I broach this topic better?


We have been married 11 years with 3 kids. I know he thinks I am the hottest woman alive. I had a lot of issues with my breast implants, and explanted 1 week ago. 

When I originally had surgery to get the implants, he was like ""Whatever makes you happy."" Then he ended up loving them, but knew they were bothering me.  I asked how he would feel about me taking them out, and he said ""a little disappointed but mostly I just want you to feel better."" He never said anything negative about my choice, just expressed concern that I may regret removing them and reiterated wanting me to be happy.

I fretted about taking them out for over a year (only had them 2.5 years). The day I got them out, I cried happy, relieved tears. I love my imperfect natural breasts and have expressed my joy to him several times over the past week. 

Finally, I asked him directly what he thought of them. He responded with, ""it's too early to tell."" Because they're still healing and will continue to remodel and heal in the coming months. I think they look better than before original surgery. In this vulnerable time, I just want him to say I look beautiful and they look good to him. But I don't want a fake compliment. He's been taking care of me and the kids plus working and I know he's tired, but he still has had multiple opportunities to comment on them (he wraps me in my ace bandage every morning). 

TL;DR My husband hasn't complimented my breasts since I took my implants out despite me asking how he felt about them, and it's starting to hurt my feelings. I don't want to fish for a possibly insincere compliment."
"My [24 M] relationship with one of my roommates [23 F] is totally destroyed. Idk if I should break the lease.


For context, the house is me, my girlfriend \[23 F\], another roommate \[23 F\], and the roommate in question \[23 F\] who I'll refer to as RM.

&amp;#x200B;

We're in month 8 of a 12 month lease. We moved in as good friends, but she had some nasty tendencies that didn't come out until we lived together (yes, I should've listened...). We're not social with her because she's very narcissistic and has a short temper. It's just the best for everyone involved.

&amp;#x200B;

3 months ago, she backed into my girlfriend's car. It was a little stressful and awkward, but they used insurance and got it figured out.

&amp;#x200B;

Last week, she backed into my car (I'm not looking for legal/financial advice). She immediate said she can't use insurance. I was okay with just using cash. She expected the estimate to be a couple hundred at best, but it came out over a thousand. 

&amp;#x200B;

We talk exclusively over text. I told her the price yesterday, and she reacted... poorly. She tried to convince me of a few wrong things: that I didn't need to fix it immediately, that I needed to use a place SHE wanted, and I could use MY insurance, but she couldn't use hers (what???). She's not very knowledgable about the process but she was trying to control all of the conversation. I let her know that it's okay if she can't pay it- we'll have to go through insurance. She made it very clear that we would do things her way or not at all.

&amp;#x200B;

So yesterday, I was visiting my parents and her parents are very close. I drive over unannounced, talk to her parents about the situation, and we agree a claim needs to be submitted. They were very nice, I was polite, everything worked. I didn't tell her I did this.

&amp;#x200B;

This morning, her dad texts me to tell me the claim is submitted. An hour or so later, I get a scolding text from RM letting me know that any friendship that may have existed is now over, to please not contact her for any reason, and a bunch of other really insulting and childish things I'll keep to myself.

&amp;#x200B;

I don't hate her, I don't want revenge, I just don't want to deal with her ever again. Did I handle this right? Should I break the lease? What are your thoughts? I'm willing to provide more details.

&amp;#x200B;

**TL;DR - Roommate hit my car, tried to bully me into not getting it repaired. I went over her head and talked to her dad to solve the issue. She sent a long, insulting text ending the friendship and asking for no contact. Should I break the lease? Did I handle this correctly?**"
"[UPDATE] My [21F] boyfriend [21M] had an outburst and friends [21F/M] are calling it abuse. Is it?


TL;DR - Boyfriend continues to be in therapy, he has not had a single outburst since moving in, he is mentally well and we have a kitty!

Original Post:https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/8hf2wg/my_21f_boyfriend_21m_had_an_outburst_and_friends/

It's been almost a year I think since I made the original post, and things are honestly better than ever. My original post didn't get a lot of attention but I personally love seeing update posts so here's mine! 

My boyfriend has continued therapy and is progressing well. As some people were concerned about me taking on a caretaker role, I am happy to say that he is very much in control of that, nor have I had to remind him about appointments, medication ect. 

He has not had a single outburst since the time I made my post, and I have long since forgiven and forgotten. My mistake was confiding in friends about what happened, unfairly putting my boyfriend in a role where he appears abusive and violent. Any issues about our relationship are discussed and resolved between us, which is how it should be! We're both very very happy with where we are at.

We also decided to adopt a cat! Her name is Maggie and is the most sociable cat I've ever seen. She fits so well with us. Thank you to the people who took the time to reply to my original post, I appreciated it. "
"My (27F) husband (32M) constantly accuses me of cheating. I'm losing my mind. What can I do to show I am loyal?


My husband and I have been together 6 years, 2 of them married. No children. To get this out of the way: I have never cheated or done anything that could be considered cheating.

I don't know whether I am losing my mind, or being manipulated,  or gaslighted, or whatever the fuck. All I know is that I cant take it anymore and I am contemplating divorce. Apologies for the throwup of text coming your way.

&amp;#x200B;

Now that we are married, he constantly accuses me of cheating when I visit with friends or go out for drinks with colleagues after work. I always either call or text him when I decide to go out to let him know. He works much later than I do, so it isnt like he is at home waiting for me. He immediately gets upset and often hangs up on me - every time. When I try to talk to him about it after, he makes it pretty clear he doesn't trust me. When I try to get more information on why he feels this way, he will then deny that he has a trust issue with me and that I am imagining it. He goes out with his friends and colleagues... but I'm not trustworthy enough to do so?

&amp;#x200B;

Lately he has also taken to checking our security cameras while he is at work to see precisely what time I come home, and if I am not home within an hour of leaving work (I work 45 minutes away), I will get a call from him to see what I am up to. I am almost always getting dog food, groceries, or stuck in traffic. Fuck me, right? When I confronted him about this and how it made me feel, he said it was just to make sure I get home safe.

&amp;#x200B;

We have BOTH gained quite a bit of weight since we have been together (me 60lbs and him 100lbs), and also aren't having sex. I am feeling quite unattractive, so in effort to not feel that way, I have started going to the gym and watching my diet. Obviously, he accused me of seeing someone else. When I explained to him why I was doing this, I also asked him if he still found me attractive. Instead of encouraging me or saying he found me attractive, he said NOTHING. 

&amp;#x200B;

Three weeks ago, I talked to him about what was going on in our relationship and how unhappy I was. Not only with the obvious trust issue that he denies he has, but the fact that we have both gained quite a bit of weight and aren't having sex. He then told me that he was **furious at me** for not letting him know what was going on with our relationship sooner. I explained to him that I am not the only one in this relationship and he has to have at least noticed that we aren't having sex. He cried, yes actual tears, that he has known we were going to divorce all along. I told him that I wanted to work it out. 

&amp;#x200B;

I thought the last few weeks after this conversation were going well. On Sunday, I used his phone for directions on Google Maps as he was driving as my phone was dead. He immediately snatched it from me and I noticed he was deleting something. I asked him what he was deleting and he said that he was embarrassed that I would find his porn history... I said that I don't care if he watches porn (we've had this conversation before). He said it was just weird porn history he was deleting that he was embarrassed about, so I let it go. After that, I bought tickets for a concert. I asked him if wanted to go with me, and he said no. I told him that was fine, that I would ask one of my girlfriends to come with me. He immediately said, ""No, I'll go with you. I dont trust you going without me"".  I fucking lost it. He then tried to save himself by saying he ""didn't mean it like that"". What other possible way is there to take a statement like that?

&amp;#x200B;

I honestly don't know what else I can possibly do at this point. I feel like I am losing my mind from constantly being told that I am untrustworthy when I know that I am. I feel like he wants me to stay at home and not have any kind of social life. What can I do to prove my loyalty? Should I even have to prove it? Can I do anything to help him get over this trust issue?

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR - Husband constantly accuses me of cheating. I've never cheated. What can I do to prove my loyalty? Should I even have to prove it? Can I do anything to help him get over this trust issue?"
"My (38M) son’s (2M) sitter (30F) drunkenly revealed feelings for me. Now things are weird.


I was debating whether I should post this to the widow(er) subreddit or here, but I think here is the best place.

Just to set the parameters of my situation - my wife died suddenly just under 2 years ago leaving me to raise a little human on my own. He was 13 months when she died and he will be 3 in June. I’ve very casually dated here and there during this time, but haven’t made much of an effort to get into anything serious. Various reasons - lack of time, continued grief, not knowing what I want etc.

I have a woman who babysits my son a few days a week. She’s pretty incredible and my son clearly adores her. She also has a 5 year old girl who has become very fond of my son. 

I’ve always thought my sitter was extremely attractive, sweet, and kind but we haven’t really gotten to know each other very well. Over the weekend I was surprised to receive a series of texts from her which indicated that she was interested in a romantic relationship with me. These texts pretty much came out of left field so I probably should have held back before replying. Nope. I immediately replied and revealed that the feeling is mutual and that I’ve felt that way for quite a while but didn’t want to make things awkward by bringing it up. 

The texts stopped pretty abruptly and the next morning, she was incredibly apologetic and embarrassed because she had been out drinking and her friend had encouraged her to tell me how she had felt about me. She suggested that we put it out of mind and that she usually doesn’t think about this stuff because she is at her best when she is single.

Unfortunately for me, this is the first time since my wife died that I can actually see myself being with someone. Her qualities are everything I admire in a partner and as I mentioned, I had already been trying to reign in a huge crush I had on her. 

It’s been a few days and things seem to be back to normal and casual interaction. Reddit, do you think I should just pretend that text exchange never happened? It’s put me in kind of a weird place as I’m feeling pretty disappointed/sad. I’d like to get to know each other and possibly see where things lead, but I don’t want to overstep boundaries.

Thanks for your input!

Tl;dr - my son’s sitter drunk texted me telling me she’s into me. I let my cat out of the bag and told her it was mutual. She indicated that she wouldn’t have breached the topic if she hadn’t been drinking - should I let it go?"
"My [21M] Father [54M] and Brother [29M] mask their insults as jokes. It's really irritating.


Seriously, my father and brother have both made hurtful and ignorant comments to my face. When I call them out on it, they say, ""We're just joking. You're too defensive. You're too sensitive."" They are making comments that I don't find funny.

I can take a joke. I joke around all the time with my friends. The jokes my friends make are more in a light hearted funny manner. My dad and brother are just cruel and mean spirited. 

When I stand up for myself or tell them to stop, they have the nerve to tell me to lighten up.

I always feel like I'm being picked on by them. It's always two against one when I'm around them. I've told them about how I used to get bullied, and they seemed supportive, but that's exactly what they're doing right now and this has been going on for quite some time.

What can I do about this?

**tl;dr: My Dad and Brother make hurtful ""jokes"" about me, and when I call them out on it they say, ""We're just joking or you're too defensive/sensitive."" I fail to see how standing up for myself is being defensive. This has been going on for quite some time. What can I do about this?**"
"Guy (32M) I’m(34F) dating just came out to me as trans (FTM)


I have been dating this guy for about a month, he’s 32 &amp; I’m 34. We met on a dating app. We’ve met up 2x/week during this time, different kinds of dates but we had a lot of time to converse and get to know each other, we’ve texted a lot in between dates as well. This past weekend I went over to his place for the first time, we’ve kissed on previous dates but haven’t gone any further which is the pace that I prefer &amp; quite honestly very hard for me to find. We made plans for me to stay the night so in my mind, sexy times were imminent. He made me dinner which was amazing and afterwards we sat in his living room to watch a show together when he dropped a bomb on me.


He told me that he’s a FTM transgender and I was extremely shocked. I had no clue, he hadn’t ever hinted at it. He explained why he waited a month to tell me, he didn’t want to scare me away, he wanted me to get to know him, wanted to get to know me and see how we were together. He told me it was fine if I wanted to leave and take time to think about it but after conversing some more with him, I decided to stay. We ended up watching the show in bed, things turned steamy and while we didn’t have sex, there was heavy petting. He checked in with me a lot during, making sure I was ok and that made me more comfortable. We had a really good night &amp; morning together, before I left he expressed interest in starting an exclusive relationship with me. He was very understanding when I asked for some time to think.


Our connection was really strong since the beginning, we have some things in common and talked for hours on our first date. Im very attracted to him, we have great chemistry. I’ve never dated a transgender man, honestly never even thought about it. I’ve had to do a lot of googling/watching YouTube videos about it and after thinking about it for a couple of days, I’ve decided I want to proceed with a relationship with him. We’ve been texting back and forth but have plans to meet up tomorrow to talk about things, he does know I’m open to being with him but there are still things we need to talk about. He’s out as trans to his friend/family/job.


My main concern is my family. They are part of a very conservative Christian denomination and while i was raised with their beliefs, I no longer adhere to them. Like they believe Leviticus in a very literal sense. We are still very close, I’m Hispanic. I know that they wouldn’t approve, but ideally they would accept him as my SO as they have other men I’ve dated.


Would it be fair to ask him to hold off on telling my parents about him being transgender? They know I’m dating someone but they haven’t met (Its early still) and apart from basics, I haven’t told them much. It’s not that I want to hide him, but I kind of want to go the same route he did, let them get to know him first and then when it feels right, let them know. It’s going to be an absolute shock for them, they’re so socially conservative it blows my mind sometimes and while I hope they’ll accept him, I don’t know how realistic that is. But I’m 34 and I’m my own person &amp; no longer believe in the things my parents believe in. I really like this guy and I’m going to date him, I just want to try and navigate this in the best way possible.


TLDR- guy I’m dating is FTM trans, parents are very conservative, what should I do?"
"I’m realizing I (F24) probably shouldn’t marry my boyfriend(M26) Ouch. It really hurts.


Throwaway. This is a bit long. I’m realizing things and just going to let it fall out of my fingers. Please tell me if I’m overreacting or if I am actually on to something. Maybe I’m being spoiled?


I love my boyfriend. We’ve been inseparable since we met. I always imagine him putting a ring on my finger. Last night before I fell asleep I had my brain spontaneously overloaded with what I can only describe as warning signs. No lead up, no trigger. 

We had a nice night together. Ate dinner, caught up on our shows, had a cuddle. And there I was, sinking into my pillow with a smile on my face.... and then abruptly images started flashing through my head. My inner voice started whispering to me, replaying all the moments in our relationship that could cast doubt on our future. 

But the one that scared me the most has still been on my mind. 


Our first year into our relationship our mutual friend had puppies. BF and I would go over and play with them when they were ready. BF routinely claimed how cute they were, how having a dog would be so fun. When I asked if we should do it, he said no, we weren’t ready. It’s too much financial hardship, too much commitment, too much work. I didn’t think so. We were two young adults with full time jobs in our own space that allowed pets. Our schedules were mismatched most often so someone would always be home. 
I made my case and eventually he relented, under the condition of - it was MY dog so I had to do all the cleaning, the training, the walking, the picking up, and the vet visits. I bought Maisy and our family started.


At the time it seemed so fair. Sure! Since I AM the one asking for the pet. As a child it was the same deal with my parents. They’d get a cat and it was to be MY cat and all the cleanup would be MY job. Makes sense, right? 

Except, here we are four years later and things are starting to not make much sense. I think my recent trips back to therapy are starting to open my eyes a little, and I feel extremely taken advantage of. 


For four years I have bought every single bag of dog food, brushes, maintenance supplies, clippers, toys - while making less. For four years I have done every single walk, run, vet visit. For four years I have cleaned every single poop that has come from Maisy’s butt. And it felt *fair* since he sacrificed to let me have the dog and I agreed. 


But now, four years later, I’m thinking I’ve been hustled. He loves Maisy. He routinely calls her his baby girl. In fact, she clearly loves his attention more. I do all the work and he gets all the love and cuddles. He constantly undermines my authority with her. All her training took 2X as long before he would routinely break commands or consequences to baby-talk her or give her what she wanted, with the added coo of, “is mama being mean to baby Maisy?!” 


What’s also unfair is that he makes *sure* he only gets the good parts of dog ownership. If she’s crying and being needy? “BAAAABE, Maisy needs out!” 

If she’s had an accident? You better believe he will NOT be touching that. “You agreed when we got her, remember?” Doesn’t matter if I’m in the middle of cooking dinner and his butt is playing video games. Or if I’m in the shower, and he’s doing whatever it is he’s doing. It will wait until I can break away to clean it. 
For a very long time that seemed fair in my mind. I *did* agree. 

But now the childhood cats don’t even seem fair. Your 7 year old asks for a kitten and you say yes, but now suddenly they are solely responsible for cleaning and feeding this animal before the kid is even feeding and cleaning itself 100% of the time? That doesn’t seem responsible to me? 

We’ve been together 6 years and I know if the shoe was on the other foot I would help out. Hell, I DID. We fostered a bearded dragon (which I’m SCARED of) for two months after he said he really wanted one. It was a test drive for us to see if we should invest in one. I did a huge chunk of the cleaning with that thing, because I knew he’d have hard days at work and really not feel up for it. Why doesn’t he feel that for me? 

Instead he’ll almost guilt me for doing my responsibilities. “Do you have to walk Maisy yet? Can’t we start dinner first, I’m starving.” 

“Can’t you clean her kennel bedding tomorrow? I wanna start our show.” 




This is a very sudden batch of resentment I feel bubbling up. I didn’t even notice how unhappy I was with the set up until last night. 


And last night, as my eye fluttered shut, I saw a movie roll. And it wasn’t Maisy, it was our kid. And like a revelation, it all fell into place. I saw it being *my* kid. I saw him saying, “hey, you’re the one who wanted a baby!” 

I saw him on his video games. This time instead of a dog under my feet, it’s a baby in my arms as I cook and clean, all the while I hear him yelling “OVER THERE, SHOOT HIM!” And carrying on with his friends. 


I saw our baby having a fever, and him saying “it’s fine,” the way he does when Maisy is being strange because a vet visit would be costly or a hassle. 


I saw me crying, needing a break, and him acting like taking on a few responsibilities that day was him being an amazing father and husband full time. 


I saw the jokes to undermine me. I saw all my rules being broken. And they’re *my* rules because he can’t be bothered to make any with me.


I saw it and I hated it. I loathed it. It terrified me. 


And my eyes were now wide open and I couldn’t fall asleep. I kept spiralling, pulling at different threads and seeing how things relate. 


I also feel unfair, because he is an AMAZING partner in so many ways. If I’m sick he takes care of me. If I’m having a bad day he asks how to help. He listens to me. He spoils me with my favorite things. He gives me tons of affection. He always has fantastic words of encouragement and support. He never lets anyone have a bad thing to say about me. He’s fiercely loving and protective and always holding my hand.
He genuinely believes I am destined for amazing things and wonderful. 

But I can’t deny he is also extremely selfish. He isn’t the type to go way out of his way for something that would inconvenience himself. I don’t see him cancelling plans to do something for me unless it was life or death.  I don’t see him ever going out and searching for something for me unless there are clear written instructions on how to get the thing and ensure it is the correct thing.  He isn’t one to spontaneously get you something you’ve hinted about or shown interest in. He needs to be *told* exactly what to do.


He’s an amazing boyfriend. He’s an amazing best friend. He is my other half. 
But after nearly six years I’m beginning to ask myself, would he be a good husband? A good life teammate? Am I just looking for reasons to be unhappy? 


Everything was fine until last night. And I’m freaking out because I don’t know why all this started popping up. But I’m sad because as it stands, one single night with deep thinking has me coming to terms that he may not be who I end up with. I don’t ever want to be “The Mom” with no other identity but the one who cooks, cleans, takes care of the kids, and fetches things you’re too lazy to look for yourself. I don’t want to be a robot. 


1- is this something I should think long about? 

2- dogs don’t necessarily mean baby, right? He may be a great father, right? 

3- men - were you this way before marriage? Did you shape up? Are you involved fathers? 

4- any advice.... please.....



TL:DR- 
Had a dog with boyfriend for four years. I’ve done all the feeding, cleaning, walking, training. What if that is how he is as a father? What if he is inherently selfish? Am I just reading into things, or are the agreements actually fair?

"I [25f] am not my dad's [53m] biological daughter. What do I do now?


As you can assume from the title, I just found out my dad isn't my biological father. I want to start this post by saying, I will always view my dad as my dad, biology will not change that. He is the most warm-hearted, funny, honest person I know. He has treated me like a princess since before I can remember. I guess I am not sure what I am looking for other than, my siblings don't know, and neither do my grandparents (I think). I am not sure who to tell and I need to get it off my chest. My parents were divorced for a brief period of time. The story goes they got pregnant with me and I was the reason they got back together and then they got pregnant with my little brother and got remarried after he was born. They had two kids prior to me. I have never doubted in my mind or ever thought I wasn't my parents biological child. 

Yesterday, as we're driving home from my grandparents house, my dad and I were joking around in the car. I can't remember what we were talking about but it went something like this. 

Me: ""well, there's a 50:50 chance I'm your guys"" 

Dad: ""Well, you are moms for sure""

Me: ""oh what does that mean""

Dad: ""nothing, I was just joking""

Me: ""no, for real, what does that mean?"" I kept pressing this multiple times because I could tell by his facial expression something was bothering him/serious. 

Dad: ""XXX, would you like to know the truth?""

Me: ""yes, go ahead""

Dad: ""I am not your biological father. Your mother got pregnant with her boyfriend at the time, and he did not want a baby. I told your mom I would raise you with our other two children.""

I had absolutely no idea this was what he was going to say. I couldn't speak, I remember my whole body tensing up and getting very hot, and I started to cry. My dad then looked at me and said ""I am sorry, XX, I fucked up by telling you that. I was never going to tell you that."" 

We sat in the car and we drove for an hour. We didn't talk except for me holding my dad's hand while he cried for a while and I told him that it doesn't matter and he will always be my father. 

My mom told me that her and my dad would answer any questions I have. I told her I didn't want to talk right now. 

I am not mad. I am more sad. I guess I just feel like this changes my identity, or makes me question something I never doubted in the first place. I wish I never found this out. 

What do I do now? Do I try and find my biological father? How/what should I say to my parents/dad because I know he is beating himself up about this? Am I wrong to feel upset? What do I do to make my dad know this doesn't change our relationship? 

 TL;Dr: I found out I am not my father's biological daughter. Looking for advice on how to move forward. "
"Is it unfair for me (19m) to want to spend a day off doing nothing?


Hello everyone, so I’m a student, as well as a full time caregiver at a senior living facility and I live with my girlfriend (18f) and it’s great. One issue though is that since I’m in school and I work, I only have 1 day off. 

I work 7-4 (4 days a week), attend school on some of those nights, and other days I don’t work I have school in the morning, except for one day.

My girlfriend is training to be an esthetician and she works part time at subway. Which is good because my skin looks awesome because of her and I get a free sandwich here and there.

I don’t care if she does less physical work or has a lighter load. I’m happy we’re both working to improve ourselves. I love her with all my heart. But there’s just one problem I can’t seem to figure out a solution too.

My girlfriend really wants to have these romantic day long outings like picnicking, hiking, boating, etc. on my day off. But I am so dead and exhausted that I usually just want to sleep in until 12pm and then roll over and sleep until 12am. 

I’ve been just going along with these dates but I feel like my brain is going to explode because I’m so exhausted and never catch a break. I don’t want her to feel like I don’t appreciate the time, money and effort in planning she puts into these extravaganzas. But I also don’t want to do them, every week. 

Am I being unfair? My coworkers seem to think so.. what can I do to make her happy without spreading myself so thin?

Tl;dr tired head ass needs some rest but his girlfriend wants to go out on his day off."
"My (F22) Boyfriend (M24) Kinda Looks Like Hitler :(


 

My boyfriend hasn't received a haircut for longer than normal. Today he was messing with his hair in front of a mirror and said that when he puts his hair a certain way he looks like Hitler.

Well

He was right.

At first it was funny, but now I can't stop seeing it. He is a wonderful, loving boyfriend, and has no dictator-like qualities. But I feel like I'm in that episode of How I Met Your Mother where the glass shatters and you can't see partner the same way again. I've been clicking between two tabs, a google search for ""Hitlr"" and a picture of us on instagram. The more I look at them the more they look alike. I don't know if its just me worrying about it or if him actually looking like hitler.

Please help, how do I stop seeing the resemblance??

TL;DR: my boyfriend kinda looks like hitler, I can't unsee it. Help."
"How do I (26M) escape my partner (27F)?


 

I have been seeing this girl for about six months. I don't feel in love with her and I think she is very immature for her age. I always treat her with respect. Basically there are some times where it is cool to hang out and I enjoy myself. For the most part, there are things she does that irritate me a lot. And she isn't willing to change those things at all. She whinges a lot and irritates me. She thinks all my hobbies and interests are 'boring'.

Where I need help is that I think she is paranoid and manic depressive. I take mental health very seriously and always want to help her, but enough is enough. She messages me every single day accusing me of being with another woman. Asking me where I am and who I am with. If I don't try soothe her over, she will get very obsessive very quickly. She can call me 30-40 times per day and often 10-20 texts at a time. Sometimes when I ignore her she will drive to my house and bang on the windows very loudly. I have extreme anxiety and I find this unbearable. As I write this, she has messaged me five times accussing me of dating another woman. I just can't take this anymore. I want her to disappear.

I have tried to break up with her before but she goes crazy. She held two knives at my face last time. She often blocks me from leaving her house to go to work the next day, and I really can't be late to work, it gets me very very anxious to be late. She knows this, and she stands in the door way and wont leave. I think she wants me to slap her to get her to move but I dont want to. I had to be forceful once to move her because I felt trapped and I had to grab her and push her away and it made me feel so, so bad. She knew this and kept asking me to get her painkillers the next week to remind me of how bad I should feel. She counts my snapchat score everyday and asked who I have snapped. In this paragraph, another five text messages from her.

I really really want to leave but I know she will drive to my house and cause a commotion and that thought is unbearable. I live with a friend who has a disability and I really need to look after him and don't want this craziness to affect his life and I don't want to lave him because no one else will look after him like I will. What can I do? Is there a way out of this? I am so miserable. Thank you for any help at all.

Tl;dr - I am stuck with this crazy girl that questions everything and messages me 24/7 and it is affecting my quality of life severely. "
"Just told my (F27) friends and family about my relationship of 3 years with my SO (28M) and they have not taken it well. How do I handle this?


Hello guys, 

TL;DR: me and my husband got married 6 months into the relationship and told my family 3 years later and every one is freaking out. 

Hello Guys 

&amp;#x200B;

I met my husband 3 years ago and 6 months later we got married. Our relationship isnt a very conventional one, and did not follow the normal trend of meet move in together get married. 

We met, 6 months in he asked to get married and I said yes. What I feel with him is just amazing. I had been in and out of bad relationships where I never felt understood but with him it felt so so easy and great. He helped me grow as a person and he is a super understanding and smart guy and sticks with me through thick and thin. 

I voiced to him when before we got married that I perhaps dont see love the same way as other people do and go through life with a very practical approach, and that I wanted to do things in life regardless of if I was married or not. So even after we got married we lived apart, at first he had a job in another city and had to fulfil the contract there, and later I wanted to live with one of my best friends cause it was always something we talked about, I discussed it with him and he said its okay since we were still in the same city and saw each other almost everyday.

&amp;#x200B;

Eventually, me and my husband moved in together and its been around a year now. Let me just say we have no problems in our relationship. No cheating, plenty of sex, some fight about mess (I am a very messy person), we travel a lot. Any fight that do happen are addressed to thanks to his great communication skills which are helping me improve mine. 

&amp;#x200B;

So last week, we had a few friends and family over for dinner and told them that actually we have been married for a few years not. I expect some backlash about not having the big show offy Indian wedding (husband is english/caucasian) my mother always wanted but nothing more than this. 

But instead I was met with ""are you crazy"" ""why did you get married so early"". Honestly I was baffled with somethings that were said and my mother went as far as accusing my husband of brainwashing me? It seemed like every one was more focused on the fact that we got married in 6 months rather than the fact that we have been together for 3 years and are really happy with our life and how we did things. My best friend was mostly upset cause I did not tell her. Some of my other friends made comments on his looks and how I could do better and they are well no longer friends. 

My aunts and uncles made comments about how he must be broke and doesnt want a big wedding (this is not true he is an engineer and makes good money). That I am going to fail my PhD cause of him, again not true he has been holding me together through all of it

&amp;#x200B;

I told them I wanted to get married and I did not want a big wedding and it happened the way I wanted. I did not tell them when it happened cause well honestly I did not want to, but I also did not want to be asked if I am crazy or pregnant etc. My husband told who he wanted and I had no problem with this. I did discuss with him at the time that I just rather keep it to myself till I feel ready to tell my family and friends and I've also always been a private person. He basically said he doesnt care who knows and who doesnt as long as he has my commitment and that he only cares about being married to me and living a fulfilling married life with me, the method to achieving this is for us to decided and no one else's business. 

&amp;#x200B;

Anyway now my mom wont talk to me (And wont let me see my dog), my aunts and uncles are little shits and are probably filling her ears with manipulative slander. She keeps messaging my husband that he stole me, hes not good for me. She messaged me once saying I am a horrible daughter. I don't know how to appease her or help her understand. 

&amp;#x200B;

Any advice would be useful."
"My partner [M 24] insists I have a natural birth and I [F 25] don't know how to explain to him that I don't want to


(this is a throw away account because he follows my main, I'm on mobile and english it's not my first language, sorry)

My boyfriend and I have been together for 8 years and we recently found out that I'm pregnant. The moment I broke the news to him the first thing out of his mouth was ""you are having a natural birth"".

A little backstory on this: throughout the years, we had several heated discussions (some of which were Really bad, once he told me that if I did not have a natural birth he was not going to show up at the hospital) about the fact that I wanted a c section and he wanted me to have a natural birth. The last one was around 2 years ago so I figured he had realized that, you know, it is my body. But apparently I was wrong.

I can't completely blame him on being so insistent because I never gave him a ""good reason"" (even though I know I don't have to).
To explain my reasons I need more background information, so I apologize.
I've had mental health issues since I was around 14, and there was a time in my life when I swore I would never have children. After the years passed and things got better I stopped being so adamant about it, to the point where the thought of having a kid was no longer dreadful (this was before we even discussed having children, so he had nothing to do with me changing my mind). But even though I'm okay with having a kid now, I don't have what the people call a maternal instinct. At all. (mommy issues, I guess). 
I don't want a natural birth because I'm concerned that I may damage my future relationship with my baby. That's basically it. I don't want to look at them and think about the hours of labor and pain.
I know this sounds selfish, wrong, entitled, whatever you want to call it. I'm not even 100% sure that this it's going to happen, but due to my trauma and past experiences I really don't want to risk it. I want to give my kid the best possible life they can have and I'm terrified I'm going to mess up. I just want a c section (yes, I know those are painful too, and according to a lot of people even worse than the alternative, but that's what I want). 

TL;DR - My boyfriend demands I have a natural birth and due to mental health related issues I don't want to. 

So, I have come here to ask the people of reddit for advice, how do I tell my boyfriend about this? Do I even tell him? What should I do? I don't even know where to start"
"I (M24) caught my GF(20) in a lie that has cheating implications


Okay so me and my GF have been together for 2 years now, and we have had an amazing relationship, until recently 

Recently she met a new best friend, who’s a girl, and has spent all her time with this person. This girl is married with two kids, so usually they hangout with the husband and the kids as well

Well her husband has a brother who my GF hit it off with a few weeks ago, she said he was moving to Cali though last month. Well this past weekend she told me she was going with her friend the girl up to Richmond with her kids to see grandparents. But the girl made an insta post of her at work.

So I messaged the picture to my gf and was like wtf and asked her what was going on and asked if it was the husbands brother she was with instead.

She didn’t message me at all, even though she read the messages. She came home pretty late and I had gone into the spare room to sleep, she never said a word to me. But after she got home I started periodically checking her social media and as I expected she started deleted me from her social.

This morning comes and she still doesn’t say anything to me, but instead leaves super early for work, what’s going on?

TL:DR caught GF in a lie and she’s completely avoiding me, what does that mean? "
"I'm(26M) questioning my sexuality after meeting this guy(40M) at the gym. I think he likes me or am I looking too much into this?


&amp;#x200B;

I've been going to Good life for 6 years. I'm not that type of dude that goes to the gym to hit on chicks. I go there to work out and leave. I used to identify myself as straight up until about 6 months ago.

I met this guy at the gym. He asked me to spot him, so I did. He has a sleeve tattoo on his right arm that resembles a forest; we got to talking about that. It was pretty sweet. That's how we got to talking.

He's a divorced dad, father of 2 girls(13 and 9), a corporate lawyer. We ended up talking for at least another hour. I click with him. We ended up seeing each other a few more times and ended up working out together. It eventually lead to us grabbing coffee post workout a lot. I really enjoy spending time with him.

The reason why I believe he likes me is because whenever we're talking he leans towards you whenever you are sitting close to one another, he smiles a lot and looks at me very keenly, maintains eye contact with me whenever we talk. He gives me his undivided attention. We joke about who has the bigger muscles (I'm fit but he's ripped), so he always squeeze my biceps, then I do it to him. He'll constantly ask me if i'm seeing anyone.Once I forgot my jacket in the car and it was freezing outside, he let me wear is jacket and when I tried to return it too him, he told me it looks better on me(I still have it). It's gotten to the point where I look forward to seeing him at the gym. Plus we text almost every day. Sometimes for hours on end 

I've thought long and hard about it and if he were to ask me out I would probably say yes. He's just so much fun to be around. Does he like me or am I looking too much into things?? If yes, Should I ask him out or let him ask me out?? Normally I have no problem asking a girl out but for some unknown reason I get nervous when I'm around him.

 TL;DR: I think this really attractive man at the gym likes me. I'm questioning my sexuality because of it. I think he likes me and I'm starting to like him. Should I ask him out or let him ask me?

"Should I (29F) talk to my friend (33M) about him dating young girls? (19-21F)


I've been friends with this guy for 7 years and he even lived with my boyfriend and I at one point. He has always dated girls younger than him, but now that he is in his 30's, it's starting to feel creepy. He usually finds these girls by approaching them at concerts, then they fall in ""love"" until things fizzle out and he finds a new one. I have noticed on a couple occasions that the girls he's with are not really strong emotionally, often recovering addicts or coming from bad upbringings. This friend of mine is someone who likes to be praised, and will often talk about himself and the great things he's doing when we hang out, so I get the feeling he dates these girls more for how they will admire him than any type of equal partnership.

My question is, do I have any right to bring this up to him? I am not concerned about ruining this friendship, as I'm starting to dislike this guy anyway, but I would like to help him and his potential future girlfriends if I can. He respects me a lot, and I think I could get through to him if I were to phrase it right. I would like to essentially point out that it's kind of creepy how young his girlfriends are and ask him to think about what he wants in a partnership, because it looks like he wants to be worshipped by these young, immature girls. He brought his new girl over the other night and I learned after I made her a drink that she is only 19! I think the timing would be good for me to bring this up, but since these girls are ""legal,"" I don't know if I have any ground to stand on in basically calling him a creep. Thoughts on if and what I should say about this?

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR - My friend is 33 now and still dates girls who are 19-21. It's starting to get creepy and I wonder if I have a right to bring this up to him as his friend, or if this is something I should ignore because he's not technically doing anything wrong."
"My (21/f) boyfriend’s (25/m) mom (50’s/f) bought us a $500 tour


I’ve been dating my boyfriend for over a year now and this summer we’re going to Italy and a few other countries for a couple of weeks. My boyfriend’s mom is super obsessed with Italy, she’s been there 6-7 times already, always visits different areas, and just really likes it. When she heard we were going, she got super excited and happy for us and started emailing us tours to go on and things to do, which I appreciated. She’s very nice and we get along very well,  but I’ve also hung out with her maybe 6-7 times total throughout our time of dating. Anyways, my boyfriend just texted me saying that his mom purchased a tour for us and the tour was $500 total. That’s an insane amount of money in my opinion. Like, I feel uncomfortable taking this offer. We’ve done Christmas and birthday gifts before, but it’s always been something like a $50 or just me contributing money into a bigger gift. I don’t know what to do or how to react, like it’s such a nice gesture, but I feel like it’s too much and truly makes me feel awkward and uncomfortable taking it 

TL;DR boyfriend’s mom bought us a really pricey tour, I don’t know how to react"
"Went axe throwing with the family, husband (36M) threw an axe at a picture of my (32F) face - I am so hurt


Last weekend, my husband and I went axe throwing with some family for a small celebration. I was talking to the owners about some fun concepts and suggested an avenge your ex night would he sort of comical. You pay them to print a picture of your ex and get to throw an axe at it to let off some steam. Again, just an idea.

My husband was with me while I was talking to the owners and decides to grab a pen and paper and draw my face and his face. He gives me the picture of his face, takes the picture of mine and set it up to throw an axe at it. Lo and behold, he gets a bullseye. He thinks this is funny, I’m in shock and getting pissed. My family is looking around at him like wtf? I crumbled my piece of paper and walked away. I am so hurt, that is just so disrespectful. 

My sister tries to console me saying he didn’t have bad intentions (she also doesn’t want to cause a scene). I tell my husband I don’t see the humour in this at all. We’ve been drinking so decide its best not to deal the issue and discuss it later... we haven’t talked about it since.

I do want to add some context, while our relationship is ok, it’s not in the best place right now. It’s not like we’re fighting but we are in counselling to resolve some of our issues. There hasn’t been anger and we’ve established communication is part of our problems. We’ve been married just over a year.

But throwing an axe to a picture of your partners face? Am I wrong for being really upset and hurt about this? How does one think this is acceptable? 

TLDR; my husband threw an axe at a picture of my face thinking it was comical and harmless. I’m really hurt but we haven’t talked about it. Are already having martial issues. What does this mean?"
