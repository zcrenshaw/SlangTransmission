"You need to stop using your laptop right now as your battery is dangerously close to blowing out.


So browsing through the ticket queue this morning and came across a fun looking one that I just had to pull. 

&gt;IT I need help. 

&gt; Hello IT this is $user at #branch and my laptop needs repair. It just suddenly separated from itself. I have included a picture. Please advise. 

&gt; PS The laptop is really hot. 

The picture she produced was a laptop that had the top part where the keyboard was from the bottom part. 

I think to myself. ""Huh... thats interes....ting OOOOOOOOHHHHHHHHHHH NOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!"" Yeah... thats thermal expansion of the battery. 

I call her up. No answer. Call her cell number. No answer. I called her boss. 

&gt; $Boss - Its a wonderful day at *our company* this is $Boss how may I assist you?

&gt; $Me - Hello this is $ME with the it support team. $User contacted us about a laptop issue. 

&gt; $Boss - Yes she is currently with a client I will have her call you right back. 

She hangs up. I call back. 

&gt; $Boss - This is $Boss. 

&gt; $me - Yes this is $me again. It is an emergency and I need to speak with $user immediately. 

&gt; $Boss - She is with a client I will 

&gt; $ME - The picture she sent us is of thermal expansion of the battery and is in danger of catching fire. 

&gt; $Boss - Look she is with a client and they

&gt; $Me - Her laptop can catch fire. I am not joking. It is vital her computer be turned off this very instant and unplugged. 

&gt; $Boss - I highly doubt that. 

&gt; $Me - OK. Well. I gave you the warning. If the battery does blow out I will point to this recorded phone call when HR has questions. 

&gt; $Boss - You are serious?

&gt; $Yes 

I wanted to say ""Duh hoy.""

&gt; $Boss - *Shouting out her door.* $User hey I have IT on the phone. I need you in my office now. 

She puts me on speakerphone. 

&gt; $Boss - Tell her what you told me. 

&gt; $Me - That picture you sent was of something called thermal expansion of the battery. You said the laptop was hot right?

&gt; $User - Yes. 

&gt; $Me - Your battery has expanded and is in danger of blowing out. IF this happens while you are using it, it can lead to sever burns on your hands. Lithium fires are no joke. 

&gt; $User - Ok. I will go ahead and shut it down when I am done with this client. 

&gt; $Me - *Mutes mic* Do the words laptop fire carry no sense of urgency with these people? *Unmutes mic* I do not believe it can wait that long. This is a kind of do or die situation... and that may not be a figure of speech given the circumstances. 

&gt; $User - OK. I will go ahead and unplug it and finish this loan on another computer. 

I submit a ticket to purchasing for warranty/replacement and pull the call log. I submit the ticket numbers for mine, purchasing, and the call log to my boss letting him know the situation. I CCed his boss and the CIO. I made sure they knew I did my job and that the user may decide to ignore me. 

Spoiler alert. She ignored me. 

Two hours later I am notified that an investigation has been opened regarding my ""Mishandling"" of the repair process and that disciplinary action may be handed down. I forward that email to my boss who responds with the notes, call log, and ticket numbers. Five minutes later the name on the investigation is changed to the manager's name. 

She continued to use it and it caught fire. Yes I have pictures... no I will not share."
