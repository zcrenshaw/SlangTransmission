6,"Why is the romance novel genre so negatively stigmatized?


I am fairly well read and enjoy lots of genres...one of those being romance. But unlike other books, when someone asks what I've been reading I feel a knee jerk reaction to say ""nothing"" because of the stigma. I feel like since the readerbase is so female heavy, there is this idea that they're book-porn.

It's most noticeable in that recently my husband and I have started a book club (he picks a book one week, me the next). My husband suggested we start a podcast to document it and to motivate us to keep on it and organized. My immediate thought was ""But not when we're doing romance novels.""

15,"Is straight sex really so disappointing for women?


I apologize if this sounds rude, I really don't mean it to be. 

I'm a lesbian, and I have very few heterosexual friends that are female. Therefore, I don't know much about straight sex from the woman's perspective. What I do hear/read about straight sex makes it seem like the common process is the man pumps &amp; cums and the woman... Doesn't. And then it ends. I have this idea that most straight men do not care about their partner's sexual pleasure, and that straight women rarely orgasm during sex. 

I imagine this is only my perception because the only stories I hear about straight sex are the bad sessions/partners. Is this how most sessions go, or am I only hearing the bad ones? Do the women even consider my perception of straight sex ""bad""?

I'm sorry my wording is a bit messy. I'm hoping my question is understandable and I don't sound like a jerk!"
