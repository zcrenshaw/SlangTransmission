17,"How do I approach this girl at work?


Looking for some advice and I figured advice from women would help more with this, but there's this girl I work with that is extremely cute and she seems nice and sincere, but she's a little shy. I want to go up and talk to her and at least get to know her a little and just see how things go. Unfortunately she works in a different department than me, so I don't get a lot of interaction with her during actual work. The only time I could actually talk to her would be on break time, which doesn't always line up. How do you think I should go about this, if at all?"

20,"Thoughts on an ABDL fetish?


So I'm single and I consider myself a decent dude. Not in a cocky way, but in a way that I dont carry baggage or have weird mommy issues and I'm not remotely creepy.  

So there's a widening divide between me and other dudes my age. I know young men have this odd  ""bachelor"" phase with practice gfs or whatever, but, I dont want any of that. What I yearn for is to have a deep, meaningful relationship with a woman where she's the ""mommy"" figure and I'm the ""baby"" figure. I dont make my fetish a huge part of my life. But the reason I've been by myself for years is because I'm kind of a brick wall without my ""little"" side and I'm too nervous to reveal this to somebody else. I cant have a relationship without it. It's mostly harmless, kind of lighthearted and not really primarily sexual.

 When my term was up in the military (unspecified branch intentional) I really took to the ""babby"" stuff quite a bit. I notice its something I do not when I'm stressed but when the stress ""breaks"" and I want to relax a little quicker. It's not related to anything psychological or it doesnt reflect on me being like, a defective adult or anything like that. I keep my place nice, eat right and  do those AM jogs every day. Also I work. Too much lol.

I know this oddity of a question has been asked once or twice but its normally by mouth breathers with a hard on and a bunch of weird ideas lol. I just want to know if this idea is seen as alien to you all, if you developed a LTR with a man and found out or if he told you. It's hard for a man to crack the binding of this topic because of how its hammered into our heads to NEVER do shit like this and how it's totally unacceptable. 

I just want to know what you all think on serious terms if a man you really cared for revealed these details to you. 

Thanks for your time and thoughts on it all.
