6,"I feel like I’m not good enough for her.


There’s this girl that I want to pursue. I literally think she is the most gorgeous girl I’ve ever met. As in I think if she wasn’t working her day job, she could be a model. I’m sitting here thinking that I’m not good enough for her. I asked her out a long time ago but she said no and then started someone else for a really long time. But now they’re broken up and I have friends telling me I should give it another shot. I wanna try and ask her on a date again. But I’m here constantly terrified to ask her cuz I’m here thinking that she is way too good and/or attractive for me. I’m sure I’ve got a ton of competition and I’m here wondering why she’d ever pick me over someone else. 

 She’s not a stuck up bitch or anything just to be clear. She’s actually a very nice and caring person. I have no idea how to go about this. "

13,"Starting school


So I’m going back to school and I have a 6 month old. Finances are really tight but unfortunately I don’t qualify for fasfa because I have previous loans that I’m paying off but behind on. Luckily, California will pay for community college class fees. The part I’m having trouble with is that I can’t afford a laptop. Does anyone know if any programs that could help?

15,"What would you think if a guy you really liked and started dating told you he doesn’t mind if you sleep with other people if you wanted?


It just doesn’t bother me anymore, it’s not that I want to have sex on the side but I’m not all that hung up about it. I don’t see sex as that big of a deal. "
16,"Dry Hair


I am a 22 year old white/Hispanic female. I normally have black hair.I have got a perm in my hair before as well as color. A few months ago I got blond highlights in my hair. I wash my hair every other day. I have had severe dandruff for most of my life. Right now it is super frizzy and always looks wild. I wear it up in a bun most of the time. I always have stray hairs/flyaways and I hate it. I want to look more professional at my job. Any hair care suggestions to make my hair more sleek and not frizzy? Thanks in advance babes!"
