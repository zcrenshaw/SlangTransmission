Dear women of reddit, I have a relationship with a girl for a year and half. Last six months I am getting less and less attention from her. I asked her if she still loved me, she answered: 'Yes, but less than in the beginning.' When I asked if I was doing something wrong she replied with no. Is it smart to end this relationship, or should I try to save it? 

PS. I still love her really much, even more than at the beginning"

Hi - 24 y/o female here. Recently graduated, moved to a big west coast city for a job. Happy with where I am and what I’m doing. But I can’t stop myself from thinking of this guy I’ve been madly in love with for the past four years - basically all throughout college.

He and I were basically on the same sports team in college and we had an unspoken rule that there was to be no fraternizing of any kind between teammates. We were pretty close though, at one point there was a period of time when we ate almost every meal with each other, went on long drives together, and I even visited his home town a couple times when his parents invited me down.

We never explicitly did anything that would make things confusing though. There was one night when he did make a weird comment about our relationship, but zilch after that. Also, this guy is a friend of mine and I love him, but he can be a total asshole. Extremely polite, good guy. But he just wasn’t the most “caring” type. I only really realized all of this after he and I (along with all our friends) went our separate ways after college.

It’s just that I can’t stop thinking about him. I was planning on having “the talk” with him, at least to just get it off my chest before we graduated that I had liked him more than as a friend all this while. But there were some extenuating circumstances which led me to just not saying anything.

It’s just that I’m placed in a situation right now where I might be leaving the country for a good amount of time now. Probably 4-5 years, give or take. I know that it seems trivial, but given that I couldn’t get this guy out of my mind for the past two years says something for me.

He lives almost halfway across the country from me, but a part of me almost wants to just fly there, meet him face to face, and get this thing off my chest. We’re still friends, but like I said - he’s not the type to keep in touch.

Im just scared this comes off as totally crazy and creepy. HELP! It’s honestly for my sanity at this point."
