16,"Talk to me about your womanly friendships


I'm 39. Just moved to a new city. Again. FML. Anyhow, I feel like adult women have friendships that are almost like relationships. Ya know, like you're in a LTR with your best friend. Have casual relationships with other women. Do any of you feel like this? I'm currently ""friend dating"" like 2 women. Just met, starting to text. Only hung out like once. I really hate how my husband doesn't understand the importance of my friendships. He doesn't get that when I haven't talked to a LTR friend in a while (like more than a week), I get sort of upset. Anyone else experience the same thing?"
17,"What can a man do in the early part of a relationship to set good grounds for the rest of it?


I met a girl not too long ago who's amazing, and the way things are going I can see it lasting a while. I really like her and I want to do what I can to avoid mistakes. I've had a couple serious relationships in the past and I've learned a lot from them, but I thought I'd ask here to see if anything jumped out to you. Things I should do, things I should keep in mind, the types of things guys might not normally know right away. Thanks :)"
