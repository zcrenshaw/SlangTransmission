I found out a guy cheated on his longterm girlfriend with me for 3 months. He suddenly stopped talking to me one day. I was curious so I looked him up on social media and found his account and his girlfriend’s. The girl doesn’t know me nor do I know her. But I want to snitch on him, how should I do that? How should I handle this situation? For a fact, I’m not letting it slide because no one is gonna get away with playing me dirty."

11,"How do you move on from an ex who is dating your friend?


Female friend of mine brought over wine and pizza several days after I got dumped after a 10 month relationship. I told her I still loved him and she encouraged me to move on (insulting his looks, telling me I could do better, and even setting up Bumble on my phone). A few weeks later I went on a hike with him and told him I wanted to get back together, but had heard some rumors they were an item. He admitted they had crushes on one another but were just friends. He also told me that we should work on repairing our friendship and then see what happened (also admitted that he still looks at the dirty photos I sent him when we were together, still thought about sleeping with me, etc.) I also sat down for a talk with her and she stated that they were just friends as well. However, four days after that, he came clean and told me they had been sleeping together since a little while after our breakup. I am devastated and feel betrayed, but they insist they didn't do anything wrong because he had already dumped me. How do I move on from this? It's been 3 months since the breakup and 1 month since I found out about their relationship. I still love him and feel completely heartbroken, but No Contact does not work because the three of us are all in school together (class of 60 people and literally all our friends are in the same group, which I have now been cut out of since they are officially dating and insisting that I am a jealous psychopath because seeing them together makes me cry).

14,"Do Women notice when a Guy is on NoFap?


Hey ladies,

I'm sure some of you have heard of the movement called Nofap which was actually started here on reddit. If you don't know what it is, it's just the practice of semen retention: not masturbating or watching porn, and sometimes even giving up sex (Hard Mode). 

The benefits (which are highly spoken of in Eastern philosophy) include: more energy, confidence, a drive to get things done, a more magnetic personality, clearer skin, and many more.

I was wondering if you all know anyone who practices this or have a S/O who does it. More importantly though, do you notice anything different in a guy when they are retaining their semen? (if you know that they are of course) Even if it's a subtle difference, if you have anything to share please comment below!

\-thanks"
