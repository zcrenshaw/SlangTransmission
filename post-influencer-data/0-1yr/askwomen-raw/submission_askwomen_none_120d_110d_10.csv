1,"Abortion megathread


Due to the high number of legislative actions happening in the United States, the moderation team has created this megathread for all of your abortion questions. Please keep in mind that despite much action happening in the US, not all of our users are American and our [Inclusivity policy](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskWomen/wiki/inclusivephrasing) should still be considered when posting.

All top-level comments must be in the form of a question. If you have multiple questions, post them in one comment as opposed to an individual comment for each question.

Please report any and all rule breaking. This thread may be locked if a respectful discussion cannot be had.
