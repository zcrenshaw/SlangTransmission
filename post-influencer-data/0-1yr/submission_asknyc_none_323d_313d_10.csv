"Any way to know what film shoots are happening and where at any given time?


I always see random film shoots all over the city and wonder what it is they're shooting, the crew usually doesn't say what it is if asked. "
"Lease Renewal Question


Hi.  Apologize if this has been asked before, but I'm in a lease predicament.  The tl:dr:  


1. I am in a job I want to leave for another job outside of NYC, but I can't before a year or else I will have to pay back the bonus I got when I started.
2. My lease expires before that one year mark, so I would have to potentially renew / find somewhere else.

If I know I want to leave, say, September when the one month job mark hits, but will have to renew my housing on, say, July, what should I do come July to make sure I can leave NY with comparative ease."
"Affordable family restaurant for Thanksgiving in NYC


Hi, 

my family would like to visit NYC on Thanksgiving and was wondering which restaurant to visit for our Thanksgiving dinner. I’ve been looking on the internet and found that many restaurants in Manhattan  offer the Thanksgiving prix fixe menu around $90 per person. Is there anywhere in NYC (doesn’t have to be in Manhattan) that offer below that price, say maybe $50-ish? 

Any kind of food is acceptable, but it would be great if they also serve turkey. And it’s okay if it’s a la carte, as long as it would fit to our budget ($50 or less per person).

Thanks guys."
"Does anyone know where to get major Shoe Alterations done?


Have a pair of winter boots that need a wider calf alteration. Specifically, a shoe cobbler/repair shop that does extensive leather tailoring like sewing additional leather on a boot shaft.


Visited multiple high-end/ reputable cobblers in Manhattan. All mention outsourcing the job to an outer borough warehouse. I’ve gotten the impression most shoe cobblers can’t fit this kind of machinery into their small shops. 


Are there any shoe repair shops that can do extensive jobs in-house?"
