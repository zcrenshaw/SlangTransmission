"Black woman living outside the U.S what struggles do you face??


It seems that oftentimes threads about the issues black women face seem to be very focused on the experience of black women living in The U.S. As a black women living outside The U.S despite sympathizing with the situation, I feel I can't really relate because I don't experience some of the prejudice or discrimination black women in America do. For example stereotypes like the 'La-a' pronounced La dash a don't exist where I live, the 'angry black' female isn't as big of a stereotype and most people understand black hair and don't ask to touch it. On the other hand there are certain cultural and traditional practices we engage in particularly after death that employers may not understand (e.g. shaving our heads, taking leave for an extended period of time to complete rituals etc.).

That's not to say none of the issues overlap. The stigma surrounding mental health definitely exist in most African communities and in my experience black women not only have to work 2/3 times as hard to be respected professionally but they're also made to feel as if their intelligence is something they posses despite their race - which seems to be the case in The U.S. as well.

 So yes, I'm just curious as to learning about the challenges black women outside of The U.S face and how it affects them."
