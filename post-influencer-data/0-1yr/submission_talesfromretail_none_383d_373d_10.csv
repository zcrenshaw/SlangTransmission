"Heads Up - $38,000 Pearls Incoming!


I used to manage a luxury jewelry store. The kind with just a few items on display at any given time and most items were more than an average person’s yearly salary.

One of the regulars was a woman who just oozed bitch out of every pore. She would remind us, constantly, that she was “Ms Saskatchewan, 1974”, which is a title that only a farmer and their sow should be proud of. It was also 32 years later. 

My staff would scatter when we saw her coming, so I often was stuck helping her. On this particular day, she wanted a new strand of pearls. 

We go through the showcase, and she puts on a strand of Tahitian pearls priced at $38,500. She hems and haws with her daughter, nods, and then... walks out of the store.

It took me a minute for my brain to register WTF.

I dashed down the mall after her, and when I caught up, said, “Mrs. 1974, you didn’t pay for those.”

I felt like Medusa was turning me to stone with the look she gave me.

1974: “Just put it on my credit card. You’re embarrassing me.”

Me: “We don’t keep card numbers on file, it’s a security concern. It will only take a minute.”

She turned as if to walk off, and then undid the clasp, slid the pearls into her hand and FLUNG them down the busy mall. 

I was too busy scrambling after the pearls to hear if she said anything else, but she stopped coming to the store after that.

"""Just Do The Return!""


*I was going to post this as a response to a question on AskReddit, but thought it would make a better post here*

I lost it with a ""serial returner"" once.  I'm  typically very calm and friendly,  which is why I'm often called to handle difficult customers.  

This customer was making a scene with one of our new cashiers about returning a bunch of plants, no receipt, most in pots with labels showing they weren't purchased at our store.

Serial Returner: ""Just do the return!  It's fine!  It is not a problem!  Just do the return!""

When I got to the register the cashier had started to cry so I sent her to the break room to calm down and told her I would handle it. 

I asked if she had a receipt.

Serial Returner: ""No but it is fine! Just do the return!""

Me: ""Ma'am I'm sorry these plants weren't purchased here.""

SR: ""No it is OK!  Do the return!  It's OK! ""

Me: ""No it's not, the labels says you bought them at *BigBoxStore*""

SR: ""OK fine! ""

She then pulls the plants out of their pots and slams them on the counter sending dirt everywhere!

SR: ""There, now it's fine! Just do the return! ""

I lost it! I raised my voice...

Me: ""No it is not fine!""

 I stuffed her plants back in their pots, brushed all the dirt I could off the counter towards her. She jumped back. 

SR: ""Oh! Why are you so upset!""

Me: ""Because you made our cashier cry and very disrespectfully dumped dirt all over my counter!  Now I will return these two plants over here with our label on them for *store credit only*, you need to take these other plants back with you!"" 

SR: ""Oh... well ok.""

I gave her her store credit and sent her on her way. 

My coworkers were wide-eyed because I really never lose my cool like that in front of a customer. 

Serial Returner has yet to darken our doorstep again."
