"Woman steals empty ring box, comes back demanding the ring


After rushing to work after my last post another interesting incident arose. For those of you that didn‚Äôt read my last post I work in a jewelry store and we‚Äôre usually blessed with great clients. Lately the crazies have been showing up. 

It‚Äôs important to note I‚Äôm the only one on the sales floor at that moment because I‚Äôm only working with one other person and she‚Äôs chilling in the back because the mall was dead. So I get to work and start doing the usual, fixing some displays, cleaning the glass, etc., when as usual I gravitate towards the ring section. Rings are my favourite piece of jewelry so I always end up by that display and it‚Äôs become my baby. I notice there‚Äôs an empty ring holder so I go to the ring drawer (which is across the store from the ring display) and choose an adequate replacement. I unlock the display, place the ring on the ring holder and securely lock the display. I leave the empty ring box on top of the display and head behind the registers to get an elastic band to put on the box (an elastic band on the box means the box is empty and the item is on display). 

I head back towards the ring box (the ring displays and the empty box is directly beside the front door while the registers are at the back) but as I‚Äôm halfway there this lady runs into the store from one of the tables outside, grabs the box and runs away. It‚Äôs not the worst issue since there was nothing of value inside it and I got a clear look at her...unique face, but it‚Äôll be inconvenient when we go to sell the ring. I tell my coworker who texts the manager but all seems to be going well until ~2 hours later when the box thief returns. She‚Äôll be C, I‚Äôll be Me. 

C: Excuse me! I bought a ring here and the box is empty!
Me: (knows she‚Äôs BSing me) oh I‚Äôm so sorry! May I see the box?
C: (hands over the box) I really expected better service from a company like this
Me: (sees it‚Äôs the same box for the ring I displayed) I‚Äôm sorry ma‚Äôam, when did this happen?
C: Yesterday afternoon
Me: Do you have the receipt?
C:No I threw it away immediately after
Me: that‚Äôs alright, your name should be in the system and I can find the purchase that way! My coworker will need to override the system to let me do the search, just give me one second 

*this is a lie, I got my coworker and told her to call security*

Me: Alright ma‚Äôam, turns out I don‚Äôt need an override, may I have your last name?
C: (gets a very nervous look on her face) This is really unnecessary, you‚Äôre treating me like a criminal! 
Me: (spends the next 5 minutes wasting time and acting like I don‚Äôt know how to do my job, I‚Äôm the youngest working there so it‚Äôs believable) 

*security arrives*

C: What‚Äôs going on?
Me: I wasn‚Äôt born yesterday ma‚Äôam"
"Customer demands I take off my jewelry and let her leave with it


I'll start of by saying I work in a jewelry store known for its swan logo. We've only been open for a month and a half but we've been very lucky with amazing clients. The store policy is that the only jewelry we're allowed to wear while on the clock is jewelry from the company. I usually wear quite a few pieces from multiple collections to showcase as much as possible and its gotten me a few extra sales. 

&amp;#x200B;

Yesterday this woman walks in looking for a present for her only child (daughter 22), unfortunately she doesn't seem to know much about her daughters preferences so its incredibly difficult to decide on an area to explore. I grab a tray and just start bringing out some pieces that seem to be popular with people her age. She's extremely picky (which is fine with me, its her money after all) but she's also nasty about the jewelry. That's when she notices my necklace which has a scorpio symbol, a gold star, and a blue gem (it sounds like a lot but its actually very nice). The conversation and the chaos that unfolds afterwards is as follows, I'll be Me and she'll be C.

&amp;#x200B;

C: Your necklace! Is that one of your products?

Me: Yes it is! Its very popular so we have very limited stock, whats your daughter's birthday? If we still have her symbol I can bring it out for you.

C: Umm...May 14th I think.

Me: (internally: you think?) Alright, thats a Taurus, unfortunately someone just bought the last one half an hour ago. We're expecting a shipment tomorrow and it might be in there, would you like me to check for you?

C: (blankly stares at me)

Me: Ma'am...would you like me to check for you? Or would you like to look for something else? We have crystal bears holding up zodiac signs and I'm sure the taurus one is still available!

C: What do you mean you don't have it?

Me: Unfortunately the demand was much greater than we thought. I can check if its coming on the shipment tomorrow if you'd like. If it is coming we can hold it for you and you can come to pick it up and pay within 48 hours. We can also look at the bears if you'd like

C: No! You have one on your neck, you're not out of stock!

Me: I purchased this necklace so its mine. Also the symbol is for a Scorpio, not a Taurus which is what your daughter is.

C: Well why cant you give it to me?

Me: The Taurus pendant? Unfortunately its out of stock, let me just hop on the computer and check if its arriving tomorrow.

C: No...the one on your neck. Why can't you just give me that one? 

Me: It isn't a Taurus symbol so it wouldn't hold any significance for your daughter. Also, I paid for it so it is my property and not available for sale. 

C: Well the customer is always right!

Me: (internally: not in this case honey) I'm sorry ma'am, my necklace is not for sale. The computer shows that necklace was sent to us and the only delivery is scheduled for tomorrow. I can write your name and number down so we call you as soon as it arrives.

C: No! Can't you hear me? Just give me yours, I don't understand why this has to be an issue.

\~My manager hears whats going on and steps in. She tells the woman she cant have my necklace and if she wants to put her name down we can call her tomorrow about the Taurus necklace. Otherwise she's out of luck.\~

C: Fine, its clear you people don't want to do business.

I have to leave for work soon so the story is a little rushed, if something I wrote is unclear feel free to ask!"
"I got caught ‚Äúchecking the back‚Äù by a customer üò¨


I work at a popular southern grocery store chain at the customer service desk. For whatever reason, numerous produce trucks haven‚Äôt been making it to our store for the past couple of weeks, so our stock has been very low. As we‚Äôre a neighbor store and small anyways, we usually direct the customers 10 minutes down the road to another location if they‚Äôre that desperate for strawberries. 

Our store is GREAT about keeping the shelves stocked. There is never anything ‚Äúin the back.‚Äù If we have it, it‚Äôs on the shelf. If the shelf is empty, we are out of stock. 

During the day, there is a 2-4 hour window where there is no one working the produce department, so customer after customer kept coming up to the desk and insisting we check the back for more strawberries, despite us telling them that we were out, and at the time I was helping this customer, the truck was an hour away. Even if there was a back to check, I have no idea where they store the extra produce, or how to add strawberries I found in the back to add it to the inventory so I could sell it to this grouchy guy. 

This customer was INSISTING I went to the ‚Äúback‚Äù to check ‚Äúboth coolers‚Äù (there‚Äôs no coolers just one cold prep room so idk what he was talking about) and we trying to convince us to let him go back and check himself, which our course we couldn‚Äôt let him do, so I went to the prep room to ‚Äúlook.‚Äù There was absolutely no produce in that room, but it was also cold AF so I stood in the hallway next to the room for about 30 seconds to make him feel better about me looking around. I‚Äôm sure every retail worker has been there. The customers always believe in the magical ‚Äúback‚Äù where we hide all the merchandise from them. But this guy came and pressed his face up against the door so he could see me standing there looking max and get he was taking me away from my job. Whoops üò¨"
