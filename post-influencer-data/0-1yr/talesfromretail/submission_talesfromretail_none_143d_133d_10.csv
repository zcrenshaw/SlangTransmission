"I refuse to say 'no' to my child so I'll use 'octopus'


A few years ago, I worked at a toy store. It's in area where conservative meets alternative so it's a mishmash of parenting styles and behaviours from the kids.

&amp;#x200B;

One interaction that stuck in my mind was a mother who looked like she rubbed a magical bong three times, and wished for the Greenie Genie to teleport her and her beatnik-looking kid from Woodstock '69 to the 21st century.

&amp;#x200B;

Within 2 seconds of entering, the kid flies to the front counter where keep all of the dollar-toys. Stamps, rubber balls, fidget spinners, slinkies, those kinds of toys.

&amp;#x200B;

He starts pulling out a pair of wooden aeroplanes from the shelf and begins a pretend dogfight. The mother flips out and I can tell she wants to take the toys off him but is restraining herself.

&amp;#x200B;

Instead she just says ""Octopus! Octopus!"" over and over again. It sounded like a command.

&amp;#x200B;

At first I assumed she named her kid Octopus, she was 'alternative' after all. However, after she then said the name 'Snoopy' (not real name), I realised the kids name was not Octopus but we also didn't stock any aquatic animal toys where Snoopy was playing.

&amp;#x200B;

The mother notices me watching from behind the register and she looks at me apologetically.

&amp;#x200B;

Octomum: ""I'm sorry, he keeps touching the toys when I told him he could look around only.""

&amp;#x200B;

I wasn't mad, kids are kids and plenty of them go nuts when they enter a toy store.

&amp;#x200B;

Me: ""Oh...was he looking for an octopus toy?""

&amp;#x200B;

Snoopy stops playing, just looks up at me and the mother quickly hushes me and gets real close.

&amp;#x200B;

Octomum: ""I'm trying to raise my boy with positive words. The real word is so negative so I'm substituting it for octopus.""

&amp;#x200B;

Me: ""What real word?""

&amp;#x200B;

She lowers her voice to a whisper. She is panicking that her answer might be overheard and undo 5 years of parenting and transform her son into a rebel that protects the Establishment.

&amp;#x200B;

Octomum: ""Fourteenth letter followed by fifteenth letter""

&amp;#x200B;

It took me a bit to realise 'octopus' was used instead of 'no'.

This kid is going to have a weird time at the marine section in the zoo."
"Man calls police on my store for giving the correct change.


I work as an assistant manager at a large crafts retailer. One day I am on a register helping out with busy lines when I get an older couple at my register. I ring everything up and then she pays in cash. After I give the wife (W) the change she asks if she could get change for 2 dollars in quarters. I say alright and take the two dollars and give her 8 quarters. I thought everything was perfect until the husband (H) chipped in.  

H: You need to give my wife the correct change. She gave you two dollars...  

Me: I did give her the correct change sir.  

H:  No you didn’t. I was standing here the whole time. You need to learn how to count money correctly.  

Me:  I took 2 one dollar bills from her and gave her...  

H: Don’t explain your mistake to me. Talk to my wife and apologize to her.  

The husband then proceeds to leave the store while I’m standing there with his wife. She gives me a sympathetic look like she knows I was right.  

W: I’m sorry about that. I will just be taking my things and leaving now. Thank you.  

She leaves the store and meets her husband outside. I’m watching through the doors as her husband approaches her, probably asking if I gave her the right change. All of a sudden he starts shaking angrily and stomps back in to the store.  I’m standing there thinking “Oh ****. What is this guy’s problem?”  

The man stomps right in front of me and gives me a dirty look.  

H:  I want to talk to the highest manager here right now!  

I call the store manager and he meets the guy up front.  

H: This idiot needs to learn how to count change correctly. My wife gave him 2 dollars and your idiot gave her 8 quarters.  

Manager:  8 quarters IS 2 dollars sir. But we can check the cameras above the register just to make sure everything was done correctly if you’d like.  

H: Don’t waste your time. You are both stupid beyond compare. I’m calling the police.

The police show up and ask what is going on. We state everything that happened and even offer to show them the cameras. The police say theres no need and ask if they want us to escort the man off the property. The store manager says yes because he is banning the man from our store.  

I still have no idea why that guy thought 8 quarters wasn’t 2 dollars.  

tl;dr Man thinks 8 quarters in change isn’t equal to 2 dollars. Calls the police on us and gets banned from our store."
"You give $5 to charity, you get $5 off, why is that so hard?


I worked at a retail store a few years ago and we had a special sale where customers donate to charity and get a 20% coupon for the whole day. Now the point of the sale was to give money to local charities. 100% of the money donated went to charity. It was a $5 minimum and the customer receives $5 off of their first purchase PLUS a 20% coupon to use all day on anything in the store. So basically the customer is not out any money. They don't lose money by donating.

&amp;#x200B;

So in walks this Karen. She comes up to my register and wants to purchase a dress and get the charity coupon. 

Me: Ok I will add the $5 donation and you will get that $5 taken off the price and then I can apply the 20% to your total.

Karen: No, I don't want to spend $5. I just want the 20%!

Me: Oh you can only get the 20% when you donate $5 to charity. But you get the $5 off your purchase as well as the 20%

Karen: I don't want to give money to charity! 

Me: Well that's the whole point of the sale... 

Karen: Well that's $5 I could spend on myself!

Me: ...You aren't losing $5, you get the $5 off the dress PLUS the 20%. You get BOTH discounts.

Karen: Just give me the 20%!

Me: I can't do that unless you donate. 

Karen: This is ridiculous!

Me: Yeah it is...

&amp;#x200B;

Karen refuses to donate so I sell the dress to her for regular price and she goes on her stupid way. I really don't understand why she was so hostile and refused to donate. 

I do know some people are very picky about which charities they give money to but we had the charities listed at every register and they were all local places and all the money stayed in the local area so it wasn't like it was going to a CEO's jet or something."
"""If you tell her that it was me, I'll have to come back here and smack you!""


Sorry if this story seems a bit choppy, it happened a while ago and I'm going off of rough memory.

This happened last year during the (Canadian) Thanksgiving holiday. I worn at a frozen food store. One of our locations is in a mall, right next to a grocery store. One day, I was helping an older lady who I'll refer to as NL for nice lady, and I'm me. I had helped NL for a little while, then she was ready to check out.

&gt;NL: Can you please break this $20 into two $10 bills?

&gt;Me: Sure!

I did just that, and then handed them to her, but she gave them right back to me.

&gt;Please keep one, and give the other to your nice co-worker.

She insisted so I went along with it and thanked her profusely. 

&gt;NL: What's your mother's name?

&gt;Me: *name*

&gt;NL: That's really nice, my name is *samename*-jane! I don't feel like a *samename* any more because I'm old. But my grandma chose the name *samename* because she thought I looked purple when I was born. What's your mother like?

I told her about my mom. She reached into the cart she had from the nearby grocery store and pulled out a bouquet of flowers she had bought from there.

&gt;NL: She sounds very lovely. Please give her these and tell her that they're from you.

&gt;Me: Aww, thank you so much! I know she'll love them. I honestly can't say they're from me though, I'd love to tell her about you!

&gt;NL: No, you'll say that they're from you. If you tell her about me, I'll have to come back and smack you!

I chuckled and promised to lie, and she smiled.

&gt;NL: Remember, God is always with you.

Then she walked out, and I haven't seen her since. I told my mom the truth, but only because I didn't want that story to die. That lady is much too wholesome to be forgotten."
