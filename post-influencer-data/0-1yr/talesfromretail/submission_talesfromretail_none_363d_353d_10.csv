"Have you ever seen a customer explode before? It's awesome!


Long. TL;DR at the bottom.

When I worked at a *insert biggest retail chain in America here*, we had an odd, but easily understandable way to display and sell our TVs. If the TV has ONE price tag on it, that means that was the price for the TV in box and the display was NOT for sale. If the TV had *two*, one would be clearly marked DISPLAY PRICE (as in that exact TV on the wall, because it’s about to be replaced) and the other price tag was for a new in box TV. The display price often reached INSANE discounts. The longer it sat there, the lower our system automatically lowered the price. One time we sold a 2000 dollar TV *brand new in box* for 200 dollars because it was the display. I wanted that TV and was sad that another coworker got to it first.

But my luck turned around. The *almost exact same model* minus a curved screen was up for grabs. Also 2 grand new. They were selling it for 500. A *really really* nice smart TV, 4K, Smart Hub, the fucking works.

A customer saw online we were selling a similar looking TV (different model number and resolution, 1080p) for 200 dollars. THE WEBSITE SAID DISPLAY ONLY PRICE. He came in and demanded the 500 dollar display.

He began threatening lawsuits for mis-advertisement, threatened to call the cops (what could they do?). Enough to where the store manager was about to cave and take the hit *personally.*

Here’s where I got sneaky. I got tired of waiting for displays that I wanted to come down, as I have been waiting for a year and saving up for a new TV to replace my 10-year-old 32 inch Sanyo (That TV is still used. It’s now in my bedroom as a monitor for me to play games while I sit on my bed).

The customer was outside ranting and raving at someone on the phone. So, during my 15-minute break, I walked up to the store manager (SM).

Me: I will buy that TV right now for 500 bucks.

SM: You sure? That customer is going to explode if he sees you with it.

Me: That’s fine. Ill wheel it out to my car and he can watch me load it into the back.

SM: Alright. Got tired of him anyway. He was being an ass to me and multiple associates. He deserves this. If corporate calls, I’ll show camera footage. That would be enough for us to be in the clear. Corporate won’t complain that I saved 300 bucks from being burned.

I literally walked right by that customer with that TV. I was happy that I got that damn TV. But the icing on the cake? He turned tomato red. Not kidding. Red.

AH: WHAT THE FUCK ARE YOU DOING?

Me: I saw this TV for sale and I bought it. Why?

AH: I WAS ABOUT TO BUY THAT!!!!!!

Me: Oh, I thought you didn’t want it anymore after you left the store. I didn’t realize you left to call someone. (I totally did btw)

AH: YOU GETTING SMART WITH ME? ILL KICK YOUR ASS!

(Here’s where I almost gotten reprimanded and coached. I couldn’t resist. The troll in me couldn’t be stopped)

Me: Sir, tomatoes belong in the vegetable section.

AH: WHAT THE FUCK DID YOU JUST SAY!?!?!

I booked it to my fucking car. Sprinting and holding a 55 inch TV over my head and slapped the back of my car door shut and ran back inside.

They got him out of the store by saying “You left the store. We don’t hold items. It’s our policy.” And, to boot, *corporate backed us up.* I dodged the reprimand because the customer couldn’t prove I made that comment at him.

I got a new TV. Made a customer explode. And, made my managers nearly die from laughing so hard. It was a good day.

TL;DR: Customer was super ultra pissed about pricing cuz can't read. Bought the TV out from under him when he made a phone call. Called him a tomato. Went home with a new TV.

"“A rib roast for 13 FAT PEOPLE?!”


I’ve been in the meat dept of a grocery store for years and anyone who has worked in the meat dept knows that the holiday season is by far the busiest. My first holiday season I had barely turned 19 years old. One day one of my regular customers comes up to me on a very busy day to place a pre-order for a rib roast for the holiday. No problem as we take multiple orders a day. I asked the customer how big of a roast she needed and she did not know. She was thinking and debating and making phone calls, etc. Finally she says to just cut her a rib roast big enough to feed 13 guests with good sized portions. She insinuated that she wanted everyone to have a nice sized chunk of meat. We have a special order book that we write the orders down in so the butchers can make sure to process all the orders as the holiday comes closer. So I fill out the special order slip and I write down her name and number and instead of figuring that she would probably need about a 13-15lb roast which would be about 5-6 bones, I just write down “rib roast to feed 13 fat people.” I was not trying to make fun of the sweet lady as she wasn’t that overweight really. My whole mindset was just to make sure the butchers cut her a big enough roast for 13 people with good sized portions and also to add some comedy I guess. I assumed that this special order book would only be viewed by the meat dept workers. Well my assumption was wrong. 

2 days later I am walking toward the meat dept about to start my shift and the butcher is there with the lady who’s order I took 2 days before and I see the butcher opening up the order booklet and I hear him say... “Ok ma’am, so you won’t have as many guests as you expected so you need to smaller roast. Ok, well let’s see what size roast we have you down for....” and he finds her name and her order in the book, and my eyes popped out and I felt so embarrassed and I almost died as the butcher reads out loud to the customer....”Your previous order was a rib roast ....to feed 13 FAT PEOPLE!!??” The butchers starts laughing hysterically thinking that it was the customer who placed the order like that. The customer then starts busting up laughing and said that wasn’t her that put down the order like that. That’s when my face was all red and I start apologizing to the lady and explaining that I just wanted to make sure the portion size was big enough so everyone had a good sized portion. I was so relived that this lady laughed it off. I could have gotten in big trouble with the store manager. This was a lessoned learned!! "
