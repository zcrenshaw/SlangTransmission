"Woman with 100 incorrect coupons probably caused $500 if not more of loss to the store.


I worked in a grocery chain in Texas that is pretty popular. Chances are, if you’re a Texan, you already know what store I’m talking about.

We had a sale on Marie Calendars or some frozen food brand where if you buy one frozen meal, you get a dessert of the same brand for free, the catch is that it had to be a certain size. They were the smaller variety.

Just as I was about to go home, a woman comes through my line with a bloody cart full of the frozen foods on sale. This was literally all she bought. 200 items, half food, half dessert. It’s so bizarre that I feel like nobody is going to believe me. By this time my bagger dipped out and this woman clearly wasn’t going to help bag so I was trapped. 

After I scanned everything, I went to scan her coupon, but it was denied. The desserts she had bought were large, full pies. 13$. The coupon was only for smaller desserts that were 6$. I decided to just call my manager over. When the woman realized what I was doing, she hastily told me that the “man over there said it was okay.”

Yeah, no he didn’t. But I digress.

My spineless manager made me push through every coupon. That means I had to manually type each coupon. For whatever reason, you can’t do quantities of coupons. I also had to adjust it to where it would take off 13$ instead of 6$.

Lasted a good 15 minutes. What the hell?"
"Getting rejected without even flirting


So it was my last shift working at a retail clothing store in a mall. For context I'm an 18 year old guy. I had this very pretty girl come up to my register to check out and proceeded saying my usual ""Hey, how's it going?"" and this is how the rest of the conversation went
GIRL: ""good, just these two shirts""
ME: ""okay cool can I get a phone number to check if you have a loyalty program?""
G: ""huh?""
M: ""can I get a phone number real quick?""
G: ""sorry I have a boyfriend"" *disgusted look*
M: ...
G: ...
M: ""may I have your phone number to check if you have a loyalty program?""
G: ""no, I have a boyfriend""
HER BOYFRIEND STEPS IN: ""yeah you have use my number""

I got repeatedly rejected from a girl who I wasn't even trying to flirt with"
"No ma'am we're not gonna move the farmers market closer to your house so you can save 25 cents


So I work for a farm. The owner is also the manager of the farmers market association in town. We do 3 markets a week, one at a local park, one on a roadside property owned by the farm, and the third one just recently was moved back into the downtown area where there's a lot of foot traffic. This is obviously great for all the vendors and we're all really excited that the city is making room for us, which has been really difficult to achieve in the past. 

But obviously there are customers who will be crabby no matter what, right?

So two weeks ago, we had the opening market at the downtown site. Things get busy and i'm trying to wait on people as fast as I can while still being friendly and chatty because everyone is curious. I look to see who the next customer is and recognize this older lady (OL) who used to come to the market frequently but who I hadn't seen in awhile. She was the kind who didn't really ever buy much but always wanted to suck up your time with conversation. 

I greeted her, chatted to her a little, then she got a very serious expression and said ""now if you'll excuse me I need to yell at your boss""

Oookay then. I took the next customer but kept my ear on her obviously. When my boss is done with the person he's waiting on, she gets his attention.

OL: I'm mad at you. 

Boss: uh why?

OL: because this market used to be closer to my house and now it's not!

Honestly my boss and I both chuckled at this becuase we thought she was at least half kidding. 

Boss: (still thinking she's kidding around) well everyone else is happy we moved locations. 

OL: (getting more irate) well im not! I had to pay a quarter for parking! You need to move the market back. 

Boss: we didn't get any business there. We were losing vendors because of it. 

OL: I don't CARE. It was more CONVENIENT for ME! Move it back! 

Boss: ...No.

She stormed off shortly after. The kicker is when I got back to my car at the end of market I had to pay a whopping $7 total in meter fees but you didn't here me complaining or demanding a location change because of it!"
