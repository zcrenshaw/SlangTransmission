"Customer try’s to return a bucket of water in place of paint.


Some back story:

I work at a large orange colored hardware store chain. I get a lot of crazy returns like; bricks I drill boxes, rocks in lawnmower boxes, opened and used product, and some things that are just plain ridiculous. However those can make stories in them selves. There are some things you need to know first. 

MOD = The manager on duty
Tint = the stuff you put in paint to make it colored

Alright on to the story!





One day I got a return that was a 5 gallon bucket of paint. I go to open the bucket and it’s water. They guy returning it insisted  that it was paint and that it was “defective”. So I called the MOD and he came over and was like “what’s the problem” and I replied “this guy is trying to return a bucket of paint and it’s water” he then opens the bucket, conforms it’s water, and says to the customer “Well there’s the problem, you just haven’t mixed it. If you want we can take you over to the paint desk and have it mixed.” To which the guy (not wanting to admit he’s wrong) hesitantly says “sure let’s do that.” So I watch as the MOD has the paint desk put tint in a bucket of water and mix it all the while the customer is standing there with look of defeat. The customer eventually left with his bucket of colored water and was “satisfied”."

Obligatory on mobile so my apology for formatting error. As for grammar and punctuation I’m just an idiot. 

So I worked at a certain phone company as a “wireless consultant” which is basically just a cashier that can change your phone plan and take your money for accessories and what not.  Well we had a strict policy where if you buy a phone case or something of the sort and want to return it, you have to pay a 25% restocking fee.  People often got annoyed at this so we would have them sign a waiver on the receipt that says they understand this is a rule.

So this elderly Karen looking woman maybe around the age of 70ish comes in to return an item (don’t remember what exactly). Okay that’s fine. I ring up her return and give her 75 percent of the price back to her. 

Cue mental breakdown. She says “I never knew about that policy” and “that is stupid” “I have been with this company for years and you should respect me” blah blah blah. I tell her to give me the receipt so I can look at it. On the back of the receipt it very plainly says in big words “there is a 25% restocking fee on all returned accessories”. Directly under that was her signature.

This escalated even worse and she began yelling and cussing and finally she looked me dead in the eyes and said “if you don’t give me all of my money back I’m going to throw up all over”. I tried to hold back my laughter but I couldn’t help but let the smallest smirk cross my face because of how ridiculous this situation was. 

For context this item was maybe 35 USD new so we are talking like 8 bucks she doesn’t get back. And normally I’d cave for such a little amount and refund the whole thing, however, I was not a manager and did not have to code to do this.

She storms off and walks out the door. Not even 2 minutes later she comes steaming back in slams her finger down her throat and sent her grandma juice all over the phone cases on the wall. 

At this point I was stunned and can’t believe what was happening. I used all of my 7 hour communication training to handle the situation. 

Me: “ma’am please don’t throw up on the merchandise”

Her: *shoves finger down throat and vomits on phone charger accessories*

Me: “ma’am I am going to call the police”

Her: *proceeds to vomit on the counter I was standing behind*

Me: *petrified* 

Her: *starts to leave, and on the way out looks at me, then sends it one more time on the glass door*

Cops come, they honestly had a hard time believing what I said. They told me there wasn’t a whole lot they could do. Manager comes in from her off day and tells me to clean it up. I quit. That was the first and only retail job I ever worked.


TLDR: old woman was mad about restocking fee she knew about. Proceeds to vomit on all merchandise."
