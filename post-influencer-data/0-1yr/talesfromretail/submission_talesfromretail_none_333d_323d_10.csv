"No, Ma'am, this grocery store doesn't have an additional entrance at the back.


Sorry if this is a wall of text.  I'm on mobile. 

I just started to work for a local florist as a merchandiser. I primarily work in a very popular midwestern grocery store. I don't wear the store uniform and only have a small badge to identify me as an employee of the florist.  However, when people see me inflating balloons or stocking flowers it's understandable for them to assume I work for the store. Even though I haven't memorized the layout of this store yet, I try to point people in the correct direction when they ask for help. 

Today, a very elderly woman entered the floral department while I was stocking. She looked very confused and walked a circle around me before admitting to me that she couldn't remember where she entered the store. She thought it was ""that way"", gesturing to the rear of the store. I haven't worked at this location very many times, but I know that these stores never have rear entrances. I told her that I am new to this store but I'm pretty sure there is no entrance back there. I pointed her toward the nearby entrance and she shook her head. She doesn't remember seeing vegetables when she walked in. So I gestured to the only other entrance, on the other side of the store and asked if she noticed the pharmacy when she walked in. She again shook her head and said she was sure it was in the back and walked away in that direction. 

She must have circled back around and made it out the front because I was there for a few more hours and never heard a fire alarm.

Tl;dr: Old lady thinks big midwestern chain grocery store has entrances in the front and rear of the store, even though they never do.
