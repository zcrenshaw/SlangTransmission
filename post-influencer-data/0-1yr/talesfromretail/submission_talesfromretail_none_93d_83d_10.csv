"An Italian man was really embarrassed that I could understand him when he was cursing me out.


So I work at customer service at a small grocery store I'm also the whitest Italian you'll ever meet. 

So it was towards the end of the day and I was doing my usual closing routine when an older Italian man wanders up to the desk and starts to angrily call for someone to refund an item. 

( I apologise if I butcher the italian, I'm an amateur lol) 

Me = me 
AM = angry man 

Me- Hi, how can I help you?

AM - IM SICK OF THIS STORE, THESE POTATOS ARE ROTTEN. 

Me- I see, can I see the receipt for them?

AM-  questo negozio è fottutamente terribile! 
(This store is a fucking terrible!)

AM-  il proprietario è un maiale, dovresti chiudere!
(The owner of this store is a pig and you should close!)

Me- I'm sorry to hear that :/ do you want a refund?

AM- Si, cazzo idiota
(Yes you fucking idiot) 

Me- Si, una momenta per piacere :) 
(Sure, one moment please :)

AM- ...tu capisci io?
(You understand me?)

Me- Si, io Sono Italiano, now I need to see your receipt still. (yes, I am Italian)

(At this point his face turned bright red and he seemed really uncomfortable being there.)

AM- No, no I do not. I'm done with this store. 

Me- I see



He then walked out and angrily sped out of the parking lot. Maybe High School Italian wasn't so worthless afterall lmao"
"""Actually, you owe us money""


Little story my nephew encountered while working at the counter this week.

Last monday, the store he works in had a promotional beer item for sale. A sort of [mini-cooler box for a six-pack of beer](https://media.hopt.eu/img/p/32211-46595-v4_product_img.jpg). Now on that monday, there was a mistake with the pricing. First of all, on the display, it was written they were €6,75, but they were actually €5,99. Furthermore, the register incorrectly added an additional €1,20 discount on it. So in total, the box (+ a six pack of beer in it) costed €4,79 for the first day. The six pack alone normally costs around €5,15. The next day, they fixed the incorrect discount.

On the 3rd day, my nephew got an ""angry"" customer at the information desk he was stationing. 

**Customer**: Monday I bought this cooler box, and yesterday I bought another one as a gift, but this time I didn't get the discount. 

\**Shows receipts showing the difference in prices**

**Him**: That's correct sir, the discount was an error that was fixed yesterday.

**Customer**:  That doesn't matter, it should have been the same price! I want my discount!

**Him**:  That's not possible.

**Customer**: Yes it is... it's only €1,20, just give it to me! Don't be difficult about it. You owe it to me.

**Him**: Actually sir, you owe us money because the discount was incorrectly given.... would like to pay in cash or card?

\**Enter €1,20 in the register**

**Customer:** What...? I...? No...!

**Him**: It's only €1,20...

**Customer:** Never mind then..."
"Preteen girl couldn't afford what she wanted


I work in a fashion store at the mall that also sells a few housewares. This happened last week, I think around my third day on till as I'm relatively new.

A young girl comes in buying a couple things, a shirt and a water bottle, the kind that looks like a cup with a straw but reusable (just looked up and they're called tumblers lol). 

We have a store app like a membership card, I don't promote it to every customer but I decide to do it with her for some reason. 

Me: You can get 20% off if you download it now

Her: I already have it

Me: Oh, then would you like to bring it up on your phone? You can get 10% off (I assumed she already used it once and the 20% is only the first purchase)

She brings it up but the code I have to enter is not showing up, which I'd never seen before.

Me: Hmm, I'm not quite sure why it's not showing up

Her: Oh, I don't have wifi

Me: Oh, that's alright then

I tell her the total and she digs through her wallet for cash, then tells me she won't get the tumbler. I say alright and put it on the back counter.

A few customers later, she comes back, with the tumbler again. She counts out cash and a bunch of change and I help her count it out, but she's short by a few dollars. 

Her: I'll come back

Me: No problem

I put the tumbler on the back counter. A few customers later, she's back, with the same tumbler, again, and we go through the counting out change again, but she's still about 65 cents short. This whole time she kept calm and didn't show any sign of being upset.

Me: If you go find wifi, you could load up the app and get 10% off, then you'd have enough

Her: How much would it be with the 10% off?

Me: *applies the discount to check* it'd be $13.00, so you'd have enough

Her: Okay

She leaves, I put the tumbler on the back counter, and a while later, she comes back with another. The app works, and she actually hasn't used it before so she gets the 20% off, and the total ends up being $11 something. Three tumblers on the back counter, and the fourth hers to keep :)"
