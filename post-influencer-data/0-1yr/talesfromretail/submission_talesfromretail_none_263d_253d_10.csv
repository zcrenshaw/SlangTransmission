"Guy accuses friend of stalking


This is my friend’s story. On mobile. 

So my friend (we’ll call him G) used to work for a clothing store in a big mall. One day while G was arranging some clothes in one of their sections a man approached him. Their conversation went something like this:

Man: you should stop stalking me

G: what? 

Man: you’re a security guard (G isn’t, and yes that’s what they guy called him). Your job isn’t to stalk people nor follow them around. 

G was just about finished with that section so he just laughed at the guy and walked away. Makes me think the guy was up to something if he couldn’t/didn’t realize that my friend was an employee. I mean which sane customer walks around arranging clothes? "
