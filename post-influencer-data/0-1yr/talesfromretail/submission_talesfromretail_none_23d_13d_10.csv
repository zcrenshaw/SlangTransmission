"“I thought about screaming help”


So this happened yesterday right before closing time. I work at a hardware store, and had just came in from my lunch. I walked over towards the paint area and here this lady screaming like someone was dying. 

C: EXCUSE ME DOES ANYONE WORK IN THE PAINT AREA?!

She’s just screaming that....to no one just standing in the middle of the store. So I walk up and help her.

Me: excuse ma’am do you need help? 

C: of course I do! I need x amount of paint.

Me: alright give me about ten minutes for all this. 

She orders quite a bit of paint and some where in the mix I fucked up and gave her a gallon instead of a quart. My boss tells me to just discount it and let her take the whole thing. That’s fine with me she’s gets out of here quicker and I don’t have to be yelled at. 

She comes back and she’s actually really nice and polite when I explain what happened. So I follow her up to the register and she actually starts telling the cashier what happened and saying it was her fault I messed up. 

While I’m standing there waiting for her to finish checking out another gentleman ( other guy)comes up.

OG: excuse me sir I have a question to ask you. I thought about just screaming help in the middle of the store but I’m not and idiot. 

Then he just dead stares at the First Lady. It took all I had to not bust out laughing. I answered his question and the First Lady tucked tail and scurried out without saying anything else."
"The coupon stack from hell that even “extreme couponers” would frown upon.


This is 1) on mobile and 2) 11 years ago. Forgive accordingly.

I was 18, working my first big girl job at your favorite VERY RED retail store. I started in photo, but that went belly up about three months in. Surprisingly, I was offered a management position in guest service/front lanes ... but it basically meant I got .25 more an hour to do the same thing the big guys do for half the pay. But whatever. I liked my job and was pretty good at it.

The cast
Me: new kinda manager
Kelly: new cashier
Paula: extreme middle aged couponer gone rouge

I was in the office that had a a one way mirror type window, doing paperwork. The lane in front of the window had our new hire. Kelly. She was there for this exact reason. 

I look up from my work to check on her now and then.  I see Kelly looking back and forth, kind of panicked and I calmly walked out to see A METRIC FK TON of coupons stacked in front of her. Kelly tried to scan each one, some working others not. 

Paula flips out each time one doesn’t scan, screaming at this poor girl.

P: JUST SCAN IT RIGHT!

K: I-I’m sorry ma’am, it’s expired it won’t scan...

P: I’m sure there’s some sort of override, just do it.

K: N-no ma’am I honestly can’t, it won’t let me.

Me:  It’s okay Kelly, I’ll take over. Ma’am this is a large stack of coupons you have. The ones she can’t scan are expired and are manufacturers coupons. There’s genuinely nothing we can do with them or they’re ours but they don’t apply to your items.

P: I’m pretty sure you’re lying but I have places to be.... what about the rest?!

(Mind you this is about 25+ coupons at least)

Me, looking through the massive pile, sorting expired and irrelevant coupons: Okay ma’am. You have 3 valid coupons left. It brings your total to $xx.xx.

P: YOU’VE GOT TO BE KIDDING. I double checked each of those coupons!

Me, gesturing to both piles I made while sorting: these are expired... many by quite a while. This other pile are ones that don’t apply to any of your items. I know it’s frustrating, but I have to follow policy not just for the store, but for the manufacturers. 

P: (I’m pretty sure you know what she said)

Me: ma’am... I am the manager. That’s why I came out here to sort this out. 

P: I don’t believe you , you’re just a kid! Get me the real manager!

Me, gesturing to my name badge: I am indeed the manager of the front end. (She doesn’t know what our acronyms for managers are) I don’t want to be rude, but we cannot accept these coupons. I have throw the expired ones out, but you can keep the others in case they apply to other items in the future. 

P: FINE. Just let me pay so I can leave. And keep your coupons! I’m never shopping here again!

(Awww darn it!)

I finished the transaction, trashed the MOUNTAIN of coupons and turned my newbie. 

Me: This doesn’t happen often (half truth, but I don’t want to spook her) but if you ever feel sketchy about something like this or anything else, flip your light on and stall them. I’ll run over right away, okay?

Kelly nodded and I gave a quick side hug then a thumbs up.  I believe she stayed there till the place closed down. Great gal.

Of course her threat of never coming back was a lie. I saw Paula several times after but never had to put her in her place again. She apparently followed the rules after an 18 yr old told her about herself."
