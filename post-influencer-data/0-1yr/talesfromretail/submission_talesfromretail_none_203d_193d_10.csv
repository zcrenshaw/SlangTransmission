"So a 93-year-old lady came in the bakery yesterday...


and bought herself a piece of cake, telling me it was her birthday. I work in a grocery store bakery, so just your standard fare, but she was so impressed and telling me how beautiful all the cakes were (bad news lady, we don’t even make the cakes, they come in pre-made and frozen but that’s besides the point) . Right off the bat I gotta tell you that I have a soft spot for old people, especially kind old ladies. I thought it was really cute that she came in to buy her own birthday cake, and really admire someone who still has independence at her age. I asked her what the secret was to her longevity and she told me, “Be absolutely wicked in your 20s, and get to know many men! I also have a scotch every night before bed.”  This came from a teeny lil old gran so I was totally shocked and couldn’t stop laughing! She also told me that she was at Pearl Harbor the day of the bombing, and after she survived that she figured she was going to live forever. Nice to have customers who brighten your day every once in awhile.  (Sorry for the block text formatting, I’m on mobile, yada yada yada)"
"A 100 grams of turkey, exactly.


My husband and I use to own a deli.

 We had one customer that was would always order like this. ""4 slices of thin cut turkey weighing 100 grams""

It is possible but inevitably it would come out to 95 or 105 grams.

She would always complain that it was too much or too little.

I was having a particularly bad day and wasn't up for the game of turkey bingo.

My husband stepped up to help the woman and sure enough it came to 105 grams.

Like clock work, she complained, and my husband looks at her, smiles, picks up her 4 slices of turkey, takes a bite puts it back down on the scale.

She didn't come back after that. We lost a customer but the frustration release was beautiful.

"Her mother forgot her


So a quick little story here that happened just this afternoon. 

Some of you probably know what a home-shop or pick-up lane is, if you don't its the lane where customers who have ordered their groceries online stop so we can bring them out and load them. Our store, unfortunately, has a single space home-shop line so we only ever service one car at a time despite being a busy store.

Well, someone parked their car in the one spot we had and ran inside, she had a buggy with her and was shopping normally. She was going to use the one space we had that was clearly marked ""store pick up, no parking at any time"" because it was drizzling and she didn't want to get wet. We had both managers on duty working near the front window, they saw this and immediately confronted her. She got really uppity with the managers and said that her mother was in the car and if it really was that big a deal to go tell her mother to do it. I guess this is the point where I clarify this woman had to be in her 40's ish and her mother was most likely in her 70s-80s. 

Well, the manager being the saint of a man that he is goes outside to ask the mother to move, at this point I'm watching through the front window cause I'm kinda board and its been a slow stocking day for me. The old lady seems nice from what I could see, she was smiling and and just gets in the other side, waving to the manager as she drives off. I keep watching her car kinda absent minded and see her pull up to the edge of the parking lot, over to the road and she just drives out of the lot. 

As soon as the manager comes back in I ask him if she's going home to grab something. He said no that she said she was just going to park so I point out that she drove out of the parking lot and left. He kinda shrugs at me and says it's none of our business. Well, it became our business half an hour later when her daughter is screaming at the front desk saying her mother left her. Turns out her mother has dementia and it's kinda bad, as soon as she pulled away from the spot she completely forgot why she was at the store and just went home. The daughter couldn't get her mother to answer the phone and was trying to blame us for her mother leaving. 

I don't know how they handled this but I just couldn't help but laugh to myself. This woman was so rude to us when she walked in and ignored all our clearly posted signs. Her inconsiderate behavior got her ditched at our store and on some weird level, I find that beautiful. "
"That... Isn't where that is kept. At all.


I am a kitchen and bath designer in a big box retail store. What I lose in creative autonomy I make up with good benefits and pay stability. Right now, it's worth the payoff. 

If you've never been to a kitchen design center in a big box store (or even a private design studio), there are sample doors everywhere that show different door styles and colors from the different cabinets manufacturers. Said doors have a ""linear foot price"" on the back of them; it's an average price based on a super basic 10x10 foot kitchen with super simple cabinets. It's used as an industry-standard comparative tool to figure out if the cabinet you like is super expensive or not. 

This guy comes into my showroom. I ask him what his project was and he said he was just looking. Which, honestly, is fine- some people just like looking and imagining. So, I do my ""if you have any questions, please ask"" thing and go back to my computer and keep working on the design I'm doing.

About 5 minutes later, he starts shuffling through my wall-O-sample doors. About a minute after that, I hear him doing the annoyed sigh thing. Which is... odd in my neck of the woods. So, I get up again and ask if he had any questions about the samples or if he was looking for anything in particular. He said thanks but was still just looking.

... K. So, instead of going back to my computer, I start cleaning the showroom and kind of hang around where he is. Sometimes, people get overwhelmed by the process of remodeling a space and don't know how to articulate their questions. He wouldn't be the first and won't be the last. It's why I am here.

I watch him go back to the sample doors, look behind one sample door, get a tiny bit frustrated, and move on to another door. He keeps repeating this for a few doors until he's getting visably frustrated at whatever he's seeing. So, I approach him again.

Me: ""Sir, I can see you're getting frustrated. I'm not trying to sell you anything- I just want to help you find what you're looking for. Is there a cabinet in your home that you're trying to match?""

Him: *sighs loudly and looks through another couple of sample doors like they killed his dog*

Me: ""SIR.""

Him: ""I... I just don't understand where you people keep your sinks!""

Me: *internal windows blue screen.*

*reboots*

""... Wat.""

Him: ""I need a kitchen sink."" 

Me: ""um, {location in store}. Would you like me to show you?""

Him: ""no."" *stomps away*

Y'ALL. It's been a year since this happened and I am still baffled. What the hell kind of Time Lord technology did he think I had behind each sample door? Why would anyone think saleable product is behind a sample of an unrelated product? Why am I even surprised by any of this? Customers are weird. "
