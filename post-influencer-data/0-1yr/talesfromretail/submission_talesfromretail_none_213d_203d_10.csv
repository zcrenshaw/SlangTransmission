"Karen called the store to complain I was rude, didn't realize she was talking to me


On a particularly busy shift I was running a register to help get the checkout line down. We're a small store so we have customers form one line and we call them over one by one. When the line got down to a reasonable length I finished ringing my customer, flipped my light off and turned to take a phone call that had been holding for me. This lady drops her items on the counter with a huge clatter and I look up at her abruptly. After reigning in my ABF (active bitch face) I apologize and tell her so-and- so can ring you out, this till is closed. She grabs her stuff and starts to huff back, but then drops it back on the. I look over and my main cashier had already started to ring the next person in line. Karen looks at me and says, ""So you expect me to wait in line again?"" Acting as if it was the most unreasonable thing in the world.At this point I swallow my ire and say ""Nope! I'll just ring you our right here."" I don't  smile or make small talk the entire transaction. 

&amp;#x200B;

And then right before she leaves, she does the thing. That thing only high level Karens do. She pointedly leans in to check my name tag and looks me in the eye. I make every effort to plaster as benign and neutral a look on my face as I can as she leaves. I have no interest in showing fear to an already agitated Karen. Frankly, at this point I don't even care.  


Now, I have a pretty distinctive voice. It's quite low pitched. However when I'm in happy retail mode, it tends to travel up a half an octave or so. A couple hours after the initial event, my day has turned around and I feel pretty good. The phone rings. The following exchange happens:  


Me: (cheerily) ""Thank you for calling Retail Retail. This is \*my name\* , how may I help you?  


Karen: ""Can I talk to a manager please?"" (at this point I don't recognize Karen)  


Me: ""I'm the manager on duty, how can I help you?""  


Karen: ""Yeah, I'd like to report an incident I had in your store. One of your cashiers was extremely rude to me.""  


Me: (sincerely concerned something happened) ""I'm sorry to hear that! Can you tell me what happened?""  


Karen: \*proceeds to relate story\* ""...and then she acted like it was a total imposition to help me. I had been waiting in line for 20 mins and she just didn't care.  


So I ask Karen which register she was at and that's when I realize she is talking about me. I recognize I have a choice; continue to allow her assumption or correct her and deal with the fallout.   


Me: \*sounding stern and appalled while maintaining my higher pitched voice\* Really? Well, that's unacceptable. Ma'am, I apologize for that and I will be speaking to her right away. 

&amp;#x200B;

Karen: ""It's just- \*re-explains scenario and how she finds it just terrible\*  


Me: \*indignant\* ""Oh I understand completely. She and I will sit down and talk about that. I will make sure she understands my expectations.""  


Karen thanks me and hangs up. It was so satisfying somehow. I can't say why."
"I close in 3 mins; so no, I cannot preform 50 mins of treatments on you...


So a bit of a back story, and I’ve posted here before. 
Formatting issues due to phone. 

I work in the beauty industry in Australia, customer service is obviously everything but we can only go so far. I don’t get paid after my allotted work hours finish so walking in anywhere close to closing isn’t going to get your a treatment unless it’s a 2 min lip wax or less. 


This is from a couple weeks ago. 
It was 5:28 PM and I closed in 2 minuets. My End Of Day was completed I had my handbag and I was ready to walk out. 
M = me. 
CL = crazy lady. 


CL: oh good, you’re not busy.  I would like (lists off about 50 mins worth of treatments) now thank you. 

M: unfortunately I am about to close, sorry. I can book you in for tomorrow? 

CL: NO. I’ve come all this way, I NEED this done for tonight. 

(At this point I’m kind of walking her backwards out the door. )

M: I’m sorry but the salon is closed. 

CL: Well I’m not leaving until you do your job. 

M: ........

CL: Well? What the hell are you waiting for? WE COULD HAVE BEEN DONE BY NOW!!! 

M: I’m closed. It’s now after opening hours. Please call us for an appointment. Have a lovely day! 

CL Starts yelling at me so I got her outside, slammed the doors shut and walked off. 

She tried calling us and talking to the manager to get me fired, but I’m the manager. 



I really don’t understand why this happens every couple weeks. I can understand making a quick retail sale before closing, or even that making you a few minuets late to close. But asking for services that takes time is just silly.

"Captain America visits my store and gives me a lesson in respect.


This just happened and I thought you guys would appreciate it. 

I work in a drugstore chain as a manager and was covering the front register and had the pleasure of dealing with a true American who taught me what respect means.

He will be CA= captain America 

I’m M = Me 

CA walks up to the register with a few items and sets them in the counter.

M = Hey! How’s it going? 

CA = doesn’t respond or make eye contact and digs through his wallet. 

Usually when the customer doesn’t bother responding I know they are going to be rude or demanding. Oh well, I’m used to it. I continue with the transaction. 

M = Would you like a bag man? 

CA = No, I do not want a “bagman”. 

I knew when he said “bagman” as one word he was being a smartass and acted like he didn’t know I meant “would you like a bag, man.” 

M = Alright, no problem! Do you want to use a rewards card with us? 

CA = (doesn’t respond to the rewards card question) Do you give military discount? 

M = We do not. Sorry about that. 

CA = Hmm. Can I speak with your manager? 

M = (the best feeling in the world) Thats me! 

Ca = Pretty unpatriotic don’t you think? Not addressing your customers with “sir” and also not giving military discount. 

M = Unfortunately I have no control over what discounts corporate offers. And I don’t address every customer with sir, I like to mix up my greetings! 

CA = I would like military discount. I have a military ID (starts to pull it out) 

M = There is no military discount man, I do apologize again but there’s nothing I can do. 

CA = looks at me and starts mumbling under his breath as he pays and leaves. 

What a jackass. Why do people walk around and demand respect when they give none?

"Which one?


Another short.

I'm serving at the register of the gas station in the UK. Its a normal day, the line is steady but unending. The station has 8 pumps but is an old design and can only fit 6 cars at a time and the previous half dozen customers didn't buy fuel.

A middle aged man was next at the register. 

I ask 'What pump?'

Customer: 'The Ford' he said while searching through his wallet.

Me: 'Which one?'

Customer: 'The Mondeo' still going through his wallet.

Me: 'Which one?'

Customer: 'The blue one' he's getting annoyed now but still looking through his wallet.

Me: 'Which one?'

Customer: 'The one with the box on the roof' raising his voice now but still looking in his wallet.

Me: 'Which one?'

He finally looks at me in rage and shouts 'Are you taking the piss?'

I just point out the window, he follows my finger and he finally notices. His jaw drops. Six cars, five are Fords, four are blue, three of those are blue Ford Mondeos and two of the three blue Ford Mondeos have identical roof boxes.

Customer: Oh

Me: 'Which one?'

Customer meekly answers 'Pump 4'

We both laughed at it and it still makes me laugh 16 years later."
