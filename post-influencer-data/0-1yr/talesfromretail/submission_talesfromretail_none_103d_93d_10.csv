"""My AirPods are faulty""


I work in a technology store. AirPods are extremely high in demand at the moment. Because I am a cashier I process refunds for products. A customer comes up to the counter with his receipt looking to refund his airpods. For some context, when you connect AirPods to bluetooth they play a noise to show they have synced correctly. 

Me: What appears to be the issue with the product?

Customer: The bluetooth connected noise is no longer playing

Me: Okay cool. In order to refund you or replace you I need you to replicate the fault for me. It is policy that I need to be able to see the issue with the product before I take any further action. 

Customer: No worries.

*Customer proceeds to pull out his phone and his AirPods, still in the case. He connects them to his phone.*

Customer: See? The startup noise isn't playing.

Me: ...sir, how are you going to hear the noise if you didn't remove the AirPods from your case and put them in your ears?
Me: *Removes AirPods from case and puts one in my ear*
Me: Could you please disconnect your bluetooth and reconnect it for me? 

Customer: Okay.

Me: The noise is playing fine. There's nothing wrong with this product, sorry. I can't refund you or replace you unless I can replicate the fault.

the dude forgot you need to put the earbuds in your ear in order to hear the sound they produce 
he also thought the seams were cracks"
"Failed a Tobacco Sting


This literally just happened. I work at a head shop that sells vape supplies and cigarettes as well as pipes. We get regular stings to make sure we aren't selling to minors, and usually that just entails some young looking person coming in, asking for a pack of cigarettes, then handing me a ""pass"" slip when I ask for I.D..

Just now a young lady walks in and asks for Juul Pods (a vape refill system). I told her we were out at the moment, and the only Juul products we have are Starter Kits (device and 16 flavor pods), which are $50. She says she doesn't have enough money and leaves. Not a minute later, a middle aged woman walks in and tells me I had failed to ask for I.D., even though we were nowhere near a sale, nor was I near the register when either woman was in the store, and all of the other stings have been passed when I asked for I.D. at the register. 

So I guess my lesson is to aggressively ask for I.D. the moment someone walks into the store"
"what the HELL is ""chocolate for boys""??


I work at a polish grocery store. It's a pretty small place, so we don't have a whole lot of stuff. This also means that i'm usually working alone. One of the things we sell are boxes of chocolate filled with either jam or liquor. 
One time, an old lady came in. She will be ""L"", I will be ""me""

&gt;Me: Hi! What can i get you?
&gt;L: Hi! I'm looking for a box of chocolate.
&gt;Me: okay, sure! is there a specific one you're looking for?
&gt;L: Yes. i need some chocolate for boys. i'm going to bring it to my grandson.

of course, i have zero idea what this means. 

&gt;me: um, okay. how about this one?

She looks at the box, a fruit one, and she scowls at me.

&gt;L: did you hear what i just said? i need chocolate for BOYS. 

??????????????? okay

&gt;me: do you... do you want a liquor one instead?
&gt;L: no! it's for my grandson! i just wan't some chocolate for boys!!!!
&gt;me: okay can you please point to one that fits the criteria?
&gt;L: seriously? fine, i'll go somewhere else!

then she leaves without buying anything. i still have no idea what chocolate for boys is."
