"i am the coupon queen.


TL; DR at bottom. (sorry, i’m on mobile)

 i work at a wholesale chain with a small bakery. everything comes in frozen but we warm up most of our breads, bagels and bake our cookies. our cookies have a shelf life of several days (but can be kept longer if properly stored). we do platters of 48 cookies (chocolate chunk, oatmeal, double chocolate or white chocolate) in five different variations as well as platters with brownie bites in the center (excluding oatmeal for some reason) which are a huge hit. 

 since it’s a membership kind of deal, the company sends out coupon books that cover the second half of one month and the first half of the next. we also have smaller, thin booklets available up front if you don’t want to ask for the monthly one up at the front desk. usually some bakery items will go on sale throughout the month (cream cheese cakes, cheesecakes, and cookies are the most popular) and it happens that our cookie-brownie trays went $3 off for the next few weeks. 

 they’re normally $21.99, so $3 off is pretty good. (if bought separately the cookies are $6.99 per 24 and the brownie bites would come to $12 because there’s a box and a half.) so normally you could get away with buying separately but with the superbowl coming, this is a decent deal. a lady decides to call wednesday while i was working the morning shift and it goes as follows. (Me; me. OL; older lady)

OL; hi, i just talked to the deli about meat platters and cheese platters for a party this weekend and i need to order some cookie platters to pickup sunday. 

 (if this makes sense, we don’t normally take orders for our cookie trays because they’re always available. the ones from the deli have to be ordered ahead of time.)

Me; well we’ll definitely have some sunday if you’re worried about them being fresh. 

OL; yes. i want them made sunday. how many cookies and brownies come in that?

Me; it’s 48 cookies, no oatmeal and a box and a half of our brownie bites. 

i took down her name and scribbled her two platters. 

OL; i need to know the exact price on those because i’ll be writing a check from the church. 

Me; well they’re normally $21.99 but they’re $3 off the next few weeks with a coupon from our member book that you can pick up at the front. so they’ll be $18.99 plus tax each. 

OL; i need the tax. i’m writing a check. 

Me; i don’t know our store tax right off hand, i’m sorry m’am. 

OL; okay, fine. so, you’ll have my coupons ready for me when i come back to the bakery for my platters? 

Me; uhhh...no. they’ll be available up front at the member service desk. 

OL; (she sighs and is very annoyed) okay, well fine. thank you. 

she hung up on me before i even got a time but it just made me laugh. people call up the bakery all the time acting super entitled like we’ll do everything for them because they pay $50 a YEAR to shop here. honey...you don’t have to be a member. 

but! joke’s on her because even though i wrote fresh on the note, the night shift made her platters that night anyway :-) shame i don’t work sunday to see her reaction. my coworker referred to me as the coupon queen. love it. 

TLDR; lady wants fresh cookie platters and since they’re on sale she expects me to clip coupons for her and have them ready when she arrives. "
