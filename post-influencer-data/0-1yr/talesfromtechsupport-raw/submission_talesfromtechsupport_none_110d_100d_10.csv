Another round of lying users getting put in their place. 

I have been working from home on the weekends as I will soon be switched over to salary so I am milking the hell out of all of the overtime I can get. 

First call on Saturday. 

&gt; $User - Hello I need assistance resetting my PW. 

&gt; $Me - Ok. I have reset your password to be *generic password* and it will force you to change it on login. 

&gt; $User - Can you reset it to be *old password?*

&gt; $Me - Unfortunately no, we are no longer able to set previously used passwords int he system. People had been abusing that in the past and there was a security event because of it. (Total pack of lies)

&gt; $User - Can you make an exception for me this one time?

&gt; $Me - Sorry there is a bit of confusion. I would if I had the permissions to do that, but the system will block me from using a previously used password. Even if it did work, the system would catch it and disable your password almost immediately. 

&gt; $User - You don't understand. Unless I can set it to that SAME password, then I will lose this loan.  

&gt; $Me - How... Umm. Normally I would never ask this, but... How?

&gt; $User - Well my assistant and I have the same password...

&gt; $Me - Are you and your assistant sharing accounts?

&gt; $User - No. 

&gt; $Me - I am sorry but I will be unable to assist any further on this. I have reset your password to be *Generic password* and it will force you to change it on next login. Here is my direct supervisor's email if you wish to escalate this. 

I pulled the call and filed a ticket on it. The VP over security replied within an hour and let me know he spoke with the user and informed him of the severity of sharing accounts. The user did send an email to my boss, but my boss just told me ""good job.""

Second instance. 

&gt; $Me - Thanks fo

&gt; $User - You have to help me!!

&gt; $Me - Whoa... sorry your urgency almost sounded like you were being attacked. (Said as a joke)

&gt; $User - *laughs* Thanks. I'm trying to extract these files sent to me by my borrower and they are giving me errors in Adobe. 

&gt; $Me - OK. Lets take a look. Go here, click this, now use this code. Ok we are connected. 

Took 20 seconds to see the issue. 

&gt; $Me - Ok I see the issue. 

&gt; $User - What is it?

&gt; $Me - These files are zero KB. The borrower must have incorrectly sent you the wrong thing. They will need to send them again. 

&gt; $User - I do not think they did. 

&gt; $Me - Well I can check the exchange side and see. One moment. OK it looks like the total size of that email is only 200kbish. Most of that is your signature. The email was not malformed and it looks like there is no data corruption. The user must have sent the wrong thing. You will need to reach out to them again and have them re-submit it. 

&gt; $User - I already did. It made them mad. They said if we can not get these working, then they will go with another company. 

At that moment the borrower sent in another email that started with. ""Oops I accidentally sent you incorrect files. Here are the correct files."" 

I clicked the email and said nothing. 

&gt; $User - *sigh* Thanks. 

Memorial day. Cell phone rings from an unknown number. 

&gt; $Me - Sup?

&gt; $User - uhhh... is this $Me?

&gt; $Me - Yes it is, who is this?

&gt; $User - This is $User with *our company* I was given this number by my manager. She said you would be able to assist with an issue today?

&gt; $Me - Umm. You hear those big bangs in the background? Im at the range. More than 4000 feet from any computer. 

&gt; $User - Well you have your phone right? I need my password reset. Im trying to close this loan and I am at the bank right now. If we can not get it reset we will lose this loan. 

&gt; $Me - No you won't. 

&gt; $User - Excuse me?

&gt; $Me - Its memorial day and all banks are closed. Even walmart banks. The it support team is closed as well today. Who is your manager?

&gt; $User - She is sitting right beside me. I will put her on the phone. 

&gt; $Manager - Yes this is $Manager. Are you able to assist?

&gt; $Me - Never give out my personal cell phone to anyone else again. 

I hung up. 

Ten minutes later phone rings. 

Vp over sales is on the line. 

&gt; $Karen - Can you tell me why I have... was that an explosion?

&gt; $Me - Im at the range and that was an exploding target. 

&gt; $Karen - Why are you at the range?

&gt; $Me - Because its a company holiday. I am guessing you are with *our company* and I will need to block this number too?

&gt; $Karen - Excuse me? Your team is here to support us. Why are you not in the office today manning the phones?

&gt; $Me - Its a company holiday. Do not call my personal cell phone again. Do not give out my personal cell phone to anyone else. I pay for this phone and it will not be used for company purposes. 

&gt; $Karen - I will call $CIO then. 

&gt; $ME - Umm... I can just hand the phone to him. He is the one who shot the exploding target. 

&gt; $CIO - Who is this?

&gt; $Karen - $Karen. 

&gt; $CIO - Care to explain why $Me's personal cell phone has been blowing up for work related purposes on a company holiday?

&gt; $Karen - (Says something about losing a 4m loan and loan officer being at bank. $CIO had phone so did not hear this.)

&gt; $CIO - You can lie to the support team all you want but lying to me will not help you. Its memorial day and banks are closed. This is something that can wait till tomorrow. Do not give out $Me's cell phone to anyone else ever again. Do not call anyone's personal cell phone ever again. We have a support line and that is the only line you will call to connect with the support team. 

He hands me back the phone and his remington 270 rifle."
