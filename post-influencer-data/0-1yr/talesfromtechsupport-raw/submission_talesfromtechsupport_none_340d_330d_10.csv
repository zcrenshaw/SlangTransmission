0,"When insufficient project budget bites hard a few months down the road (a story compilation)


This is from a perspective of a production engineer who watched it all go down from the sidelines, with no powers to do anything about it, nor technical expertise to get involved myself. The only thing I could do was get out before everyone gets hit by the s***storm.

(I previously posted the two stories in another subreddit, so all of this is copied verbatim)

**About 6 months ago:**

I had a chat with an IT employee about a ""server"" setup that I discovered when I was checking a circuit breaker. The so-called ""server"" setup consisted of multiple desktop computers piled together.

The employee eventually mentioned about a coworker who was given a project to improve the ""server"" as it was having trouble with keeping up with the ever-increasing volume of data entries and reading.

Budget request for a proper server hardware? Denied. Run the service on other existing server hardware? Other departments and some of the IT managers threw a fit due to concerns about THEIR services being impacted by my production department's needs. (My workplace has a lot of conflicts between departments. There are a couple stories that would go here or the notmyjob subreddit). Request for my production department to contribute some money to the server project because IT department won't? Lol no.

The coworker did more research, and noticed that there was a specific load that was hitting one of the desktop computers hard.

One or two 15,000 RPM hard drives and some sort of a hard drive controller card for that one desktop? Nope. Request to move that one specific load to elsewhere? All options denied.

So the coworker decided to request permission through email to use RAID 0 of two or three hard drives from decommissioned computers. Permission granted.

RAID 0 config of two hard drives (from my understanding) almost doubles the read and write performance (of the slowest hard drive in the config), slightly increases latency, and also doubles the risk of failure because if one drive dies or the RAID config spazzes out, all of the data is lost. All two or three hard drives are likely to have been used for years before being decommissioned, and then being brought back back into service.

The coworker pulled an old hard drive from the decommissioned computer (maybe two), setup RAID 0, and then pushed the desktop computer back into server usage.

Problem solved.

I am not an IT expert, but I am not looking forward to the day when manufacturing stumbles due to that RAID 0 config of two or three different hard drive models crashing. I hope there is regular data backup, but I'd imagine a failed RAID 0 config would require time to replace it and there will be a gap in the data records between the last backup and when the RAID config failed.

EDIT: Why does my department have a server made of desktops under IT's supervision? My only guess is that some sort of office politics ended up with an ugly compromise.

**A few days ago when I got an update regarding the ""server"" after I had moved onto a new job:**

I have already moved onto a new workplace, but a few former co-workers reported that the ""server"" (which is just racks of old office computers) failed. More specifically, it was the computer that had a RAID 0 of used hard drives and was responsible for the parts ID tracking system. The backups won't work, and from what I've heard, someone in IT incorrectly assumed that RAID = backup and initially assumed all was fine when the server initially went down, which may have delayed the troubleshooting a bit. I guess they forgot to check what RAID setup it was, because RAID 0 has no redundancy. Although that does make me wonder if they're slow with replacing dead hard drives in proper RAID setups ""because the RAID is still running"".

Long story short, someone high up in my production department got in a heated argument with IT during a meeting. In the aftermath of that argument, IT proceeded to punt the server and broken backups to mechanical, electrical and controls engineers that were never hired to work with servers, and wished them good luck. I have no idea what that senior manager in my former department said, but apparently it was enough for IT to walk away.

Before I left the workplace, there were already conflicts/confusion between IT and some departments over who has responsibility for what systems. Some departments like the production department I was in have their own Ethernet networks that are outside of IT's supervision. IT never clamped down on the ""accessing industrial control systems from home with remote access"" either.

During the ""server"" outage, the production engineers had to set the parts ID reporting function in our industrial control systems to bypass, and assign people to manually copy the parts ID on paper in order to continue production.

I wish I could provide more updates, but I don't work there anymore so it's no longer my problem. Nor do I have the technical skills to fix a broken RAID 0 or backup to work as a consultant. I saw the writing on the wall a few months ago.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

After I posted the second story, I recently got an update. Someone got a backup to work, although it was very out of date. The server was eventually handed back to the IT department, but the two departments are bickering over how much the two departments should pay for a proper server hardware. That's the limit of what my former coworkers have told me. I'm guessing the two departments are going back to square one, a klunged mess made by shoestring budget and office politics compromises, which I won't be a part of anymore.

Oh, and the department that was only using Windows 2000/XP and got pwned by a malware incident a few months ago has not made any plans of migrating to Windows 7/10 when I left my workplace for the last time. They still didn't want to pay to rewrite their custom in-house software that only works with Windows 2000/XP. I don't think much has changed since I've left."
