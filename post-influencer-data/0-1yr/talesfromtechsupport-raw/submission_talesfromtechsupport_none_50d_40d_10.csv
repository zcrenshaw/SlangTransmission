0,"This call broke my heart


This story happened many years ago when I was working at a multi media company in customer services.
Back story: this was a recent career change, as I used to be self employed and spent most of my adult life working in manual labour, so being sat at a desk listening to customers bitch about their crappy WiFi or TiVo not working was very new to me.

Cast: 

Me: whoever that is?

SW: sweet woman 

The call comes through and I say my usual script “ hello my name is....”and ask her for her account number 

Sw: ( in a very sweet shy voice) I’m so sorry I don’t know it, my husband usually does these kind of calls.

ME: that’s ok madam, I just need to ask a few questions to make sure that it’s your account.

She agrees and answers all questions perfectly, 

Me: so what can I help you with today?

I say trying to sound cheerful, as I usually love talking to the old dears, and making them laugh just to put a smile on their faces.

SW sounds very upset and I could hear her almost crying on the phone, she collects herself and says, SW: I’m afraid that my husband has passed away and I don’t know what to do with the new account.

What had happened was that when her husband passed, she called our company to change the name on the account from her husbands to herself, and due to a glitch in the order, the system thought she was a new customer and was being billed as one as well as still being charged for the old account and was being charged late fees, as well as being charged a month in advance for being a new customer.
But that’s not all, she was also charged for moving home.

As I’m looking at this monumental cluster fuck of an account, I see what her bill was supposed to be £20 per month for a phone line, it was now over £200! WTF.

As this is being told to me and I’m seeing it in front of me, i can hear the poor SW crying on the phone, she only had a tiny state pension to live on, how the hell was she going to pay for this bill?

ME: oh my god!...ok, let me tell you the good news first.

SW: alright.

ME: I’m sure I can get rid of most of the charges, the bad news is I’m going to need you to hold the line for quite a while as I deal with all the departments involved.

Note: I cannot call her back as the system automatically switches the account as soon as the call ends.

I then spend the best part of an hour talking to my manager, the credit department,retentions and the moving department, AT THE SAME TIME! On multiple lines all the while I’m still talking to SW.

Finally after talking to all those different departments for nearly an hour and missing my lunch break, I got back on the call.

ME: hi, I’m back again.

SW: oh, hello... did you manage to do anything?

She was such a sweetheart and was so patient with me.

ME: yes I did, ( I say like I’ve just conquered a nation ) your husbands account has now been shut down and all charges have been erased, I got my manager to refund the advance charge on the new account as you are not a new customer, I got the moving team to refund you the moving charge and I took care of the late fees, so now you’re direct debit is back to £20 per month as usual.

SW: oh that’s amazing, thank you so very much.

ME: it was my pleasure and once again I am so sorry about this ( I apologised a lot throughout the call).

After that, her son comes on the phone and firstly thanked me for getting her account settled, and then payed her bill for that moth, so in the end the £200 bill that she was looking at turned into absolutely nothing.

This call really hit me hard because I had lost both my parents earlier that year, and just like SW my dad had everything in his name and my mum didn’t have a clue what to do.

Thanks for reading.

And yes roast away at my poor grammar, I live in Scotland so I have no excuse lol."
