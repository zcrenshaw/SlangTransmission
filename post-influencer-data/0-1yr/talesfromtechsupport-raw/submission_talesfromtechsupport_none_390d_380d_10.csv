0,"Yes, anyone can send an email, including the kid you gave up for adoption 40 years ago


I'm sure I'm skating the line here with this story considering the amount of ""tech support"" that was actually provided, but I've been dying to tell it. If I'm in the wrong sub please tell me (and suggest the right one if you can). Thanks!

So anyway, I work at a college  help-desk. My job mainly consists of helping students and staff navigate the extensive and somewhat convoluted College system, more or less monitor the systems and alert admins when something is going wrong for students or in general (online school program is down, wifi out,etc) as well as maintain the library computers and make sure the 60k piece of crap printers don't jam more than twice a day. 

A big one is emails. My college uses Gsuite, which is basically just fancy Gmail that the college makes students get when they register, and is the only email they'll send college related stuff to.

 I get a call one day from a woman who sounds kinda panicked. 

Me: Hello, how can I help you?

Lady: Hi, are the college emails private?

Me: what do you mean?

Lady: I mean I thought only the school could contact us through them, right? Just the school?

I know the email is basically just a gmail with some extra protections on it from the college, but otherwise works just like a normal email and tell her this. 

Lady: are you sure? Because I haven't put it on any sites or anything and I just got an email from a woman claiming to be the daughter I gave up for adoption 40 years ago?!

Yo, *what*? This floored me. I couldn't actually advise her on what action to take, all I could tell her is if she hadn't posted it anywhere there was a very real possibility that it was her daughter. Emails also aren't listed anywhere outside of online classes where other students can see them, so it genuinely was a, ""holy shit"" moment. I ended up giving her my name and she said she'd, ""come in and update me on what happens"" because she was going to pursue it. I was honestly hoping she would actually come in, though I didn't expect it.

Low and behold two days later she came to the desk and asked for me.

It was her daughter.

Through some question and answer stuff she figured out this lady was legitimately her daughter, and had managed to track her (the mother) down through a lot of extensive file digging and found her college email through this (apparently you can request emails). She was so excited and stunned because she'd hoped forever her kid would reach out but she never did, and she didn't even know where to start looking for her (she thought she'd moved as a kid, turned out she was in the same county of the same state the woman gave her up for adoption in). 

Now she has a daughter, and a 19 year old granddaughter, and both of them are coming up to visit the mother in September.

She told me if I hadn't been able to help her eliminate the possibilities of it being a hack she might never have responded. It's very tech-support lite in a sense, and I don't really think I should be given that much credit, but I'll be damned if that wasn't the best experience I've ever had at my job. "
