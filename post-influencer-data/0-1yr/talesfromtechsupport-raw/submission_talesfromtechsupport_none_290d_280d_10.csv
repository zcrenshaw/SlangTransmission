&gt;This story happened in the not so distant past. The cast is big but the story is straightforward. I work a regular job but still do some gigs on the side for extra money. ""An advisor once asked the Western Paladin how much gold would be enough. ""I have no need of fools who can imagine â€˜enough,'"" he told the advisor's corpse.""  




Name | Role | Notes
---|---|----
$Me| Bank B tech| devilishly good looking and hilariously underpaid.
$Buddy| Bank B tech| has nothing to do with the story
$SecB| Bank B Security guy| Also not really in the story
$Branch MGR| Bank A branch manager| Has been on site since 8am
$Regional MGR| Bank A Regional Manager| Also not a happy camper
$SecA| Bank A Security Tech| Also not around much, is wearing a silly hat
$Cutover| Decommission tech sent by BankA| Poor, poor man.
Movers| Picking up $BankA's old equipment| Keep reading



So the job is simple. BankA sold a bunch of branches to BankB and on the appointed weekend our cast arrives to put on the play of taking out all the computers, servers, printers and camera system from one bank and putting similar equipment in from another bank. Job starts at 7pm Friday night and runs until 3ish am or whenever the correct milestones have been hit.  The order of operations is simple:

$Cutover takes down all the old pc's, printers, servers and phones, verify the movers have everything and seal the truck  
$SecA packs up the old DVR and security stuff  
$Branch and $Regional verify everything is good, lock the doors and leave.  
$Me, $Buddy and $SecB enter the branch, doing the needful and get it ready to open for business that Monday morning. 

So we get on site around 7pm, the branch looks good, $Cutover has almost everything lined up at the door ready for the movers to come get it but they need the okay from BankA's HQ in order to power down the final server, printer and work station. He's also waiting on the movers. So we just start inventorying our equipment and figuring out where to put everything, no big deal. $SecA is doing, something, who knows.  

Now this branch is in a downtown location at the bottom of a larger building so its accessible to the public even at this time. So a very disheveled man in a stained grey sweatshirt, camo jacket, black sweat pants and a very warn out baseball hat comes knocking at the branch door. The $Branch MGR opens the door to ask the guy what he wants, I don't overhear him directly but apparently he said he was there to rob the place or something, then says he's there to move equipment. $Branch MGR manager obviously asks him for paper work, he says its in the truck and just kinda wanders off. $Branch MGR closes and looks the door, says the guy smells drunk and she's pretty sure he was just homeless. We all kinda exchange glances but then get back to work. 10 or 15 minutes later the dude is back, with a equally poorly dressed associate but wearing one of those Russian winter hats, and a handful of paper work. Turns out this is the movers, or a sub of a sub of a sub contractor because of the name on the paper work does not match anything we have. They also say they're not boxing anything up. Que lots of phone calls and texts from both $Branch MGR and $Regional MGR because they are not happy a pair of drunk Russians showed up with shoddy looking paperwork to take a bank branch's worth of computers with them. Anyway after some back and forth they say they'll pack the equipment up and one of the movers goes back to their truck to get boxes. The remaining mover starts asking me kinda weird questions like, is the equipment getting thrown out, where it's going and so on. Sets off my spider sense real bad, felt like he was thinking about just stealing and selling the stuff. I get the $Branch MGR aside and tell her as such. So the second mover comes back with the boxes and they get to work. They're just randomly filling the boxes, not counting anything, not recording any serial numbers, nothing. So $Regional MGR crosses over from concerned to pissed and polity orders everyone except the managers and $coutover out of the branch right that second, and locks the door behind us.   

$Me, $buddy and the rest of the crew and just hanging out in the buildings lobby trading war stories and complaining about the IT companies when 2 of our cities finest and heavily armed Sheriff's deputies show up in the lobby.  The movers had hightailed it out of the building shortly before their arrival so no one was arrested but it was pretty crazy. Anyway things calm down but we're still in the lobby since the $BankA people aren't too happy and aren't letting anyone back in until the $cutover tech is done. Which takes I think forever. Also they need to get a different moving crew in because all of $BankA's equipment still needs to be outta there before we they can leave and handover the branch.   

I think it was about midnight at the point and I went out and got tacos, because why not. Anyway a second crew of slightly more sober Russian movers shows up, starts packing everything and gets things rolling. I think it was about 1am before we were finally able to get into the branch and get started. $Cutover had been on site since I think noon, both $Branch MGR and $Regional MGR| had been on site since 8am. 

The rest is just the usual deploy ""fun"" and really isn't a good story. We got done something around 6am.

Next time I decide to do some ""easy"" ""weekend"" side work, please slap me.
