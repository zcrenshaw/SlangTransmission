0,"In which a user deletes 400 pages one at a time.


The title pretty much says it all. 

Me: lovely IT person 

Caller: Lovely nurse (I work for a Health care provider in the UK). 

&amp;#x200B;

Me: Generic IT greeting

&amp;#x200B;

Caller: Hi Alpha\_Uterus, I hope you can help. I accidentally left a document open and lent on my keyboard, and now it has 2000 blank pages. I've managed to get it down from 2800 to 2492 but i'm just wondering if there is a quicker way for me to do this?

&amp;#x200B;

Me: OK, lets start from the beginning. (Takes user details and connects to machine)

&amp;#x200B;

Caller: So the information I need is on these last 5 pages of the document. I've been scrolling to the top of each page and deleting it one by one but my hand is worn out now. 

&amp;#x200B;

Me: .... So you've deleted 400 pages one at a time?

&amp;#x200B;

Caller: Yep, I can't lose this document! 

&amp;#x200B;

Me: How long has it taken you?

&amp;#x200B;

Caller: About an hour so far. 

&amp;#x200B;

So long story short i copied the last 5 pages into a new document and showed her how to save this and delete the original with the blank pages. 

&amp;#x200B;

It's my last day here tomorrow. The user who deleted 400 pages by hand, one at a time, was a lovely story to leave on."
