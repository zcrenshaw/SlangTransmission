0,"North Korea was bombed. Google it!


It's my last week working tech support before switching to a new, non-TS job and I couldn't help but reminisce about my craziest callers. I've been cursed and screamed at, called all kinds of names, the list goes on! But this one man takes the cake. He was not incredibly abusive, in fact, he was a pretty nice guy (though a bit loony). I only remember this call so well because of the sheer... insanity of it all. 

&amp;#x200B;

$Me - Me, a Tier 1 Tech for a university with a large online student base 

$NM - Nice Man with a few screws loose (or maybe just drunk)

&amp;#x200B;

It was around 10 pm  on a Tuesday. The nights were always a bit slower so I was enjoying screwing around on my phone as I waited for calls to come in. The phone rings and takes me away from whatever gacha game I was into at the time (Lovelive?). 

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt; $Me: ""Thanks for calling \[Uni\] Tech Support, my name is /u/Bunrouen. May I start with your first and last name please?

\&gt; $NM: ""\[Name\]. Are the \[Uni\] servers down? I can't access my courses.""

\&gt; $Me: ""I haven't heard anything about the servers being down. What seems to happen when you try to access your courses?""

\&gt; $NM: ""I get a message saying 'an error has occurred', is this happening because the US just bombed North Korea?""

&amp;#x200B;

Wait, what!?

&amp;#x200B;

Usually that message pops up because the page took to long to load and we need to clear out the cache and cookies. Sometimes it happens because they got switched into another class or got taken out all together and there is no class to load. Check his class schedule, all seems fine. I am almost 100% sure that this has nothing to do with the US-North Korea relations but I decide to ask some probing questions to make sure his internet isn't just down. 

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt; $Me: ""Are you able to access other parts of the internet? Like your email, Facebook, Google?""

\&gt; $NM: ""Yeah I can get on Google and other stuff, I just can't get into my classes.""

\&gt; $Me: ""...""

&amp;#x200B;

I begin trying to perform the mental gymnastics required to make such an Olympic-level of assumption but I give up and decide to just try to attempt troubleshooting with the man.

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt; $Me: ""Alrighty,  let's just try some basic troubleshooting like clearing out your cache and cookies. Sometimes this hap--""

\&gt; $NM: ""I'm telling you! This is happening because North Korea got bombed. You should Google it!""

&amp;#x200B;

I'm starting to think that I might be the crazy one so I \*\*DO\*\* Google it. Lo and behold, no such thing had happened. The first few articles talk about the Korean War. Nothing from 2017. 

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt; $Me: ""Hey, \[Name\], why don't we try to clear out your cache and cookies. I think that might help the issue your having. Can you tell me what browser you're using? Is it Google Chrome, Fire Fox, something else?""

\&gt; $NM: ""It's ok, I just finished this bottle of wine so I think I'll just listen to some jazz music and head to bed later. Should I pop open the red or white bottle, next?""

\&gt; $Me: ""Sorry, \[Name\], but I can't make that kind of recommendation. If you still can't get into your classes tomorrow, we open at 6 am, \[State\] time. Is there anything else I can help you out with tonight?""  
\&gt; $NM: ""Nope, just hope everything stays peaceful out here. Have a good night!""

I am left wondering what the heck just happened. Was it a prank call? Was he just lonely and wanted to talk to someone? Just a drunk man and his insane ramblings? He did not sound inebriated during the call so it really threw me off when he said he had been drinking (but it also solidified in my mind that he was just not thinking straight). Glad to be done with  callers soon. Very soon..."
