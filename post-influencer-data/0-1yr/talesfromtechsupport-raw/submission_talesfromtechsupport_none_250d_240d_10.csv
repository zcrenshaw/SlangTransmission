0,"We do not have a cache of people's social security numbers


It was mid-2001. I was working on the technical support lines for a medical billing supercomputer something-or-other, a subsidiary of WebMD at the time. We were renting time from a GE mainframe and using it to handle incoming claims from doctors, hospitals, etc. Data came via dial-up mostly. The protocols were X-Modem, Z-Modem, Kermit, etc. You get the idea. It was pretty old-school.

Well, I was the lucky SOB to receive a technical support call from an irate billing agent who was upset that her submissions kept getting rejected by our computer. I logged into the relevant part of the mainframe, checked out the raw data that was being submitted, and noticed:-

1. The claim was for a male dependent.
2. ...who was getting a hysterectomy.

""Ma'am, does the patient have any children?""

""Yes, she does. Why?""

""The system says that the patient is a young man.""

""Billy? He's ten. Why would he want —""

""— a hysterectomy?""

""What?""

""Billy is getting a hysterectomy, according to the system.""

""Nonsense!""

""Quite. Here's the data we're receiving. The SSN is \_\_\_\_\_\_\_, the date of birth —""

""That's not his SSN. You must be pulling that from somewhere else.""

""Ma'am, I don't think we keep a database of people's social security numbers.""

""How can you be so sure?""

""I'm fairly sure it would be a felony.""

""But you're getting the wrong social security number from somewhere!""

""...which means it's coming from somewhere other than us.""

""But I'm submitting the correct social security number!""

""...which would mean we've got the right SSN.""

""But you haven't!""

""...which means we're receiving the wrong social security number from somewhere.""

""That's circular reasoning. Give me your supervisor.""

FYI, neither WebMD nor its subsidiaries keeps a database of people's social security numbers."
