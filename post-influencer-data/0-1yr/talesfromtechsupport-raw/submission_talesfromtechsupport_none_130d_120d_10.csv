0,"Usually angry reviews ruin my day... this time it made my week


I make browser extensions, it's largely thankless work.

&amp;#x200B;

The emails and reviews you will get require a thick skin. If it doesn't work for a user's version of Chrome/Firefox -- guaranteed 1 star. If it doesn't have functionality X -- 1 star and ""I will come back and update my review if the developer updates \[except I won't\]"". There are no 2-4 star reviews because reviewers are extreme people.

&amp;#x200B;

The demographics on the Chrome webstore are 10% thankful, 40% need help, 49% entitled and 1% psychopaths. 

&amp;#x200B;

Anyway, because I'm a masochist I decided to put an uninstall form that opens after a user removes my extension where they can optionally leave feedback. This has been excellent! Two reasons: 1) I can see why people are uninstalling and 2)

It's therapeutic! Not for me, some users really need an outlet after they yell at their screen and headbutt that uninstall button. Here's one I got today:

&amp;#x200B;

""OK SO FIRST OF ALL, YOU HAVE ACCESS TO THE MICROPHONE. WHO KNOWS WHAT YOU DO WITH THE AUDIO. I FIND THAT VERY SUSPICIOUS AS A PRETTY PARANOID PERSON. HOPEFULLY YOU CAN REROUTE YOU AND YOUR CO-WORKERS MINDS TO HAVE THREE THINGS THAT I HAVE AND YOU DONT. A DEPTH PERCEPTION. A FUNCTIONING LIVER. AND A PULSE.""

&amp;#x200B;

I'm very glad that this user found an outlet and it was on my uninstall form rather than in the reviews. The thing is, my extension's only purpose is for surfing the web with your voice. It's a voice control extension. It's literally called \*word that rhymes with rip that is on your mouth\* and surf. The tagline is ""voice control for the web"". I'm not sure what they were expecting.

&amp;#x200B;

I understand the liver and pulse thing have to do with my apparent alcoholism and lack of basic human morality, respectively. But what's the depth perception jab all about, I wonder?"
