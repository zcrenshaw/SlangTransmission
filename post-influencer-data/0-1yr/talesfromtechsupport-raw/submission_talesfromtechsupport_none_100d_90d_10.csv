0,"We don't HAVE an iPad


I was doing inventory at our 40 or so locations across the country, which involved emailing, calling, texting, begging, screaming, and crying trying to get the staff to just send me the serial numbers for their iPads. Every location got instructions via email telling them to remove the case and look at the serial number engraved near the bottom of the back side of the iPad. OR they had the option to go through settings and screenshot it for us.

One location was particularly adamant that they didn't *have* an iPad. I called them on FaceTime to talk to them face to face.

Me = Me

CluelessEmployee = The Clueless Employee

Me: Hey! We're just trying to get the serial number from your iPad so we can log it in our inventory.

CluelessEmployee: I told you over email that we don't HAVE an iPad.

Me: Oh. Well what device are we FaceTiming on?

CE: It's a Logi tablet.

Me: ... Uh. A what?

CE: It's a Logi tablet, not an iPad.

Me: ...

Me: ...

Me: ... What makes you say that?

CE: Because that's what it says on the box.

Me: Which box? Can you show me?

CE: Ugh. Hang on.

// CE goes to dig out this box she's talking about and shows me.

// What she has is the box that the iPad's keyboard/case came in. It's a Logi (Logitech) brand case. She saw the picture of the case on the box and assumed that's the box the iPad came in.

Me: Oh, I see the confusion. Can you please take the case off the iPad for me?

CE: WE DON'T HAVE AN IPAD.

Me: I'm sorry. What I meant to say was, can you please take the case off the device we're FaceTiming on and see if it has an Apple logo on the back?

CE: Ugh. Hang on.

// Grunting, swearing, almost dropping the iPad, more swearing

Me: Did you get the case off?

CE: Yes. There's an Apple logo on the back.

Me: Ok, please read off the serial number at the bottom.

// I get the serial number and hang up. It's been a running joke in our office for months now."
