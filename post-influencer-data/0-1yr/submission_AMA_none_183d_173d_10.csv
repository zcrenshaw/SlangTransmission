"I am a selective mute. AMA!


I have selective mutism, these means that although I understand language and can be completely verbal, at times I am unable to speak due too anxiety/my throat physically constricts. This can last a couple hours to weeks. I didn't speak at school for a year (when I was 12) and was completely mute for 2 months with everyone (including family) when I was 10. I am 16 now and though most people grow out of it, I haven't. AMA!"
