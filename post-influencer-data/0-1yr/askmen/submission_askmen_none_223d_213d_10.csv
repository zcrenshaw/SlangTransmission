"Was the first 'I love you' you said to your SO real love, or do you think as time went on, you got to know what really loving someone means and you weren't in love with your SO at that first 'I love you'?

"If you woke up to find your credit card was used by your girl what would you do?


Genuinely asking for a friend here. Personally I would have dropped her on the spot. 

They’ve been dating for about 9 months now and this just finally came up in conversation. Told me she grabbed his card while he was asleep and blew a decent chunk of money (for a broke college student) on some serious bullshit. 

I would have broken up with her on the spot. WWYD? "

"Curiosity about men from a female


 Are there any men on here that actually appreciate women with small breasts and prefer them over fake boobs? + 1 more question. Do you guys ever scroll past Instagram and see a sponsor from Fashion Nova and not actually want to fuck every girl that appears to be ""hot"" on social media?

I'm asking because just like women are portrayed a certain way, men are stereotyped as horny 24/7."
"Have you ever engaged in an online dating long distance situation? If so, how did it go?


(I don't want to say relationship, because that might exclude some people).

This could've played out in a number of different ways: Traveling and ended up matching with someone once you got back because the app hadn't readjusted; Someone visited your area and the aforementioned happened; you have a your distance set reaalllly far to cast a wider net; or it was a plain old app glitch and you managed to match with someone far away; etc.

**If you matched with someone who was considerably far away from you (whatever that means to you), ended up hitting it off, and wanted more, how did that go for you? Did you end up meeting them? Did it blossom into anything?**

I've matched with my fair share of European men while living in a large American city, and they've all seemed really chill about keeping things long distance, but it's personally not something I'd be interested in, so I'd like to hear your stories! It must work out sometimes!"
"How should I move forward after not kissing her on the second date?


So I matched with this girl on Tinder two weeks ago. We hit it off well over text, and I made plans for us to meet up at a local donut shop to meet one another and get to know each other. The date went great, and we ended up talking for 2 hours. A couple days after that, she texts me saying she thought about me and just wanted to text me, so I schedule a second date to go ice skating, which was tonight. We had a great time, talked about a lot of shit in her car after the rink closed, and before I got out, I hugged her but didn't kiss her. I can't get the thought that I should have gone for it out of my head, because I'm afraid she'll feel I'm not interested in her and lose interest, so I texted her to let me know when she's available later in the week so we could hang at my place. She responded with ""Will do"", and now I'm anxious.

 &amp;nbsp;

Logically, I should take the ""will do"" as a positive response that she'll get back to me later in the week, but I can't help but think the ""will do"" is more like a ""I'll see"" or ""maybe"" in the sense that she's lost interest and is going to ghost me. I'm sure what I'm feeling right now is just regret for not going for the kiss, as I'm positive I should have, but now it's frustrating that the regret is making me think everything is ruined from this moment on. I don't want to go the next couple days dreading her text back to me, only to realize that I worried over nothing at all. Can someone give me some words of encouragement?"

"What do you ask for at the hairdresser's see you don't come home looking like coconut head? Have you had any terrible haircut experiences?


My boyfriend comes home from the hairdresser's every single time looking like Lloyd Christmas. He's got a short haircut, but perfectly round, almost straight-cut bangs across his forehead. He says he just asks for it to be cut short and it comes out like that every single time, I don't know what the hell he's doing. I would love to be able to give him tips on how to ask for something more specific and less ridiculous, but I don't have a clue about short hair (and I don't think he does either). I know the hairdresser's is stressful for him so having a plan would be super helpful!

What short cuts can you ask for at the hairdresser's if you want some of your forehead covered, but don't want to look like Courtney Cox in Scream 3? Have you had any truly awful haircut experiences? How do you avoid that next time?"
