"How often do you take one look at a girl and think ""yeah she's cute but there's no way, no need to waste my time""?


Just curious how often other guys think like this"
"How do you convey to someone attracted to you that you don't have big goals in life, and instead are satisfied with mediocrity ?


I'm done with fighting for something that I don't even want in life simply because others tell me it's normal and attractive. Not everyone is destined for greatness, and in fact this whole thing felt like a charade to me, given that the majority of people end up being mediocre, not standing out in any regard for their whole lives. Giving up has been the most freeing experience for me as a man.

Why do I ask the question in the title ? Some time ago at a friends wedding, I met a woman so passionate about her work that I lost myself in time in admiration of her. We king of got off, and she asked me out for a date, but lurking on twox, askwomen and relationship advice, I've reached the conclusion that I'm part of the undesirables, I am the type of man without any drive in life, and I am the type of man many women regret wasting their lives with. I don't feel bitter about it, and respect this desire, but it feels fair that I make this known to her as early as possible, as to not make her think I've been using her or misleading her. How do I do this without being self-deprecating, self-defeating ? Without humiliating myself or her in the process ?"
"Guys who are happily married: what's a recent ""yup, still the one"" moment your SO had?


I'm curious, because people talk about big incidents/milestones in a relationship that made them think ""my guy/girl really does love me"". But I don't hear people don't talk about the little day-to-day actions that reaffirm this.

So, I was curious to hear some stories."

"How to remove teenage boy stench


I’m a teenage boy and my room smells awful. My sisters and mom have all made comments about how bad it smells so I figured I better deal with it. I changed the covers on my bed, did the laundry, and I put baking soda on the carpet and vacuumed it. I dusted the hell out of the room and swept and everything. I also opened the door and window and set up a few fans blowing full blast. But there’s still one problem...

The stench remains. If anybody’s got any more advice, I (and I’m sure many other people in this subreddit) will be very thankful."

"How do you deal with getting a woman's number at a place you frequent when you aren't interested?


For the first time in my 28 years, a random woman, specifically the cashier at the grocery store by my house, gave me her number today (wrote it on the receipt before giving it to me). It's nice but... I'm happily married (I wear my wedding ring and rarely put my hands on my pockets). How do I proceed? Just ignore it happened? Acknowledge it next time I she her and say I'm married? Go to a different grocery store all together? I'm an introvert and an overthinker, but please help."
"If someone started up a medieval battle camp, kind of like paint balling but instead of paintballs and guns you get armour and specially created non lethal weapons, and instead of military camps you get castles and sieges, how often would you go?


Honestly, I just want to spend the day wielding a sword and wearing chain mail and screaming religious text at other men, and then go to the inn for a horn of ale after. Why hasn’t someone started this yet?"
"Have you ever had experience when a friendship turned into a romantic relationship?


In a situation where you weren’t interested romantically but something happened or just with after a period of time you developed feeling towards your female friend? Or if your female friend initiated it?"

"So many young men feel lost nowadays with no idea what to do with themselves. Have you ever felt like that too and how did you get out of it?


I've had trouble with myself for a while now with not really having a reason or desire to wake up and go ouside. For a while I didnt know what was wrong with me until I started looking into the modern day male identity crisis. It had a lot to do with young men feeling lost and despressed. They have problems finding close friends, trouble dealing and connecting with woman, dont have any long term goals to give them purpose and fill the void with video games. I really connected with that and was a little happy, that I wasnt the only guy, who felt like this. Problem is, most of them just talk about that there is a male identity crisis and how it came to be, but no one has an answer to how to fix it.

So I'm just left here with knowing whats wrong, but not knowing what to do about it. Do any of you guys ever felt like this too and did you manage to get out of this feeling of uselessness?"

"What is the most painful experience you’ve had involving your private parts?


A long time ago, my (now ex) gf decided to give me head and thought she would start with my balls. The thing is, she also thought biting was a key part to giving head. I thought my left one (Jeremy) had popped. I was crying for a solid hour."
"Guys who persistently ask for nudes... Whyyyyyy?


Particularly before sleeping with a new person, what is it about receiving nudes you like? Is it to 'try it before you buy it' or what?"
"Why am i atrracted to any girl who talks to me and can't just have a platonic relationship ?


I'll be honest, I'm 20 and have never been in a relationship. I grew up as a shy-introverted kid in an all boys school. 

I'm always thinking about any girl who tries to talk to me. I really don't want to think like that, I feel like I'm being creepy and desperate and possibly might make some people uncomfortable or weirded out.

I tend to crush on any girl who really shows me positive attention. Is this because I'm lonely and everyone around me isn't?

Any advice?"

My wife and I exchange subtle jabs that sound like tender terms of endearment at first blush. For example, my current favorite is “I still love you”. If I get the timing right, it’s both devastating and hilarious to both of us. What are your best terms of sarcastic or sardonic affection?"

"Tired of smoking weed and it's become a soft addiction. Dudes who quit smoking pot, how's life after giving up the devils lettuce?


I just turned 31 and for the last 5 years of my life I've gotten stoned just about every day. I'm not a heavy smoker and usually only smoke at night, and I live in a legal state. However, I feel like it's caught up to me. The perpetual brain fog, the urge to always smoke at night to ""relax"", or simply the fact I haven't given my brain a chance to run clean for years. Most importantly I feel like weed has exacerbated my GAD and played a roll into my depression not improving. 

It's definitely become an addiction. I've realized that one of the worst things about weed is it doesn't have any blatantly major side-effects, but overtime you create an addiction to it and the small side-effects start to accumulate.

Weed just isn't for me anymore. I'm curious to hear from other guys who gave it up, and if they have any positive stories to share?

Thanks!"

I've only had one serious girlfriend before. After a year she ghosted me. So I'm not super good at doing break ups.
Anyway, I just started a new job and one of the cashier gave me her number. I took it and she asked if I wanted to hangout.
Being bored i took it. But I dont really like her. So how do I let her off easy?"

"Why don’t guys touch female friends more often?


I was walking to class today and bumped into a good guy friend who was in that same class.  He put his arm around me when we started walking together and I rested my head on his shoulder for a few moments before we separated. I’ve literally been thinking about this all day, it was such a nice feeling!  I wish my guy friends initiated this kind of touch more often, because usually it feels like I have to pull the love out of them. :/"
