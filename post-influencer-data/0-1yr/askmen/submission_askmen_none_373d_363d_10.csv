It's no secret that once September rolls around, the ladies are itching to go apple picking. So just wondering for those of you dreading it... why aren't you down to indulge our inner #basic? What are your reasons for avoiding it? Like, is there something else you'd rather be doing instead?"

About 8 min.

8 mins of dog being very excited and literally trying to be as close to me as possible. And me giving him the best belly and back rubs ever..... I think he may be trying to figure out how the borrow into me so he can be closer.

"College Dropouts, how are you doing now?


I dropped out of college halfway through my second year due on medical grounds due to mental illness, as a result I feel behind my peers as those I went to school and college with are now graduating.  Im looking to go back to college as a first year when I'm 22/23.  

For those of you who dropped out for one reason or another, has it worked out? Did you go back to education in something different or find your own path? "

"How do you guys feel after breaking up with someone who you knew wasn't good for you?


I just went through a breakup about a week ago but the weird thing is that I've been feeling great. And I don't know if it's weird to be feeling great.

The relationship lasted almost exactly one year and was rough from the start. Lots of issues and we even broke up and got back together a few times. I'm not looking back this time, and I feel like it's the best decision I've made all year.

The thing is, I'm not used to feeling this good. I thought it was gonna be way more difficult because my previous relationship ended after a year as well and I was devastated for a few weeks afterwards.

A lot of threads here talk about how sad and difficult it is to go through a breakup but I'd love to hear some stories of the other side of the coin."

"Why is it that a majority of men tend to turn inwards and push away when they are feeling bad about themselves?


My boyfriend recently said that he wanted some space to work on himself because he’s been feeling upset in his current life situation and explained to me that he cannot better himself while simultaneously being with me at full capacity. He assured me he doesn’t want to break up, and it didn’t seem as if he did. I’m just wondering why men seem to have a tendency to pull back when feeling this way, rather than ask for support "
