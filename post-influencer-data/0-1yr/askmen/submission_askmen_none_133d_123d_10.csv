"Men, what cute thing has your SO done recently?


My girlfriend works ass early on Sundays and I don't work in Sundays at all. Last week, she got up early and started getting ready while I slept but she got too cold after her shower and jumped back in bed with me to warm up only in a towel. It was the cutest fucking thing I've experienced in some time."

I mean I know why I like them, reasons which I'm going to specify just below, but are there some any other reasons that you find for this question?

My reasons:

~Soft
~Cute underwear
~Surprise when no underwear
~Make chest look more interesting
~I can imagine they're the eyes of an imaginary             face where the belly button is the nose ehehe
~Conversation topic"

"How do you wake up a sleeping wife without pissing them off?


I don’t understand this shit, but my wife is extremely difficult to wake up and then acts like I’m an asshole for doing it because she only remembers the part that works.

When I try to wake her up nicely (kiss on the forehead, soft voice), I’m completely ignored. I still try it, but I know it won’t work.

If I use a regular speaking voice at her, she zombie moans at me like it’s some kind of effective form of communication while she remains asleep. I’ve had this go on for upwards of 10 minutes before.

I can wake her up by throwing the sheets off of her, shaking a limb, and using a raised voice. But then she gets pissed at me and says I’m always an asshole when I wake her up. Well no shit. It’s the only option I have.

Thing that confuses me is that when she can’t rely on me to wake her up, somehow her alarm is sufficient. And yet she still regularly asks me to “make sure” she wakes up."
"I find really ""hot"" girls unattractive. Have you ever felt this way? Why?


Girls that most guys would consider ""hot"" don't really do it for me. A good example of this would be Melania Trump, who is undoubtedly gorgeous, but someone I'm just not attracted to. However, I'm mostly focusing on the local types.

I think it could be a few reasons. An example would be that maybe if I think they're really ""attractive"", I figure they've also been with a lot of dudes -- which is a turn off."
"Single men of reddit, what are the little moments you miss the most about being in a relationship?


I woke up this morning (45F), sad about not being able to walk around the house in just my man's shirt over my naked body, having his scent all over me after a night of making love. It hit me so hard right in the chest.

What are the moments you remember and long for again?"
"Men of Reddit, what did you do to move on from a girl you loved?

"Men of Reddit who cut the cord, how did your content viewing habits change?


Finally cutting the cord and a little nervous about not being able to watch sports live anymore.

But hoping this gives me more time to spend less time in front of a TV and gives me more time for my passions and hobbies.

Anyone else who cut the cord, what's your experience been?"
"How to show my dad I appreciate him?


I’m 19 and would just like to show my dad how much he means to me, because I feel like I don’t really do it on a day to day basis. Is there anything you guys have done to show your dad how much you care?"
"What’s something that your SO does that’s normally annoying, but you bite the bullet because it’s makes them happy/super cute when they’re being all happy?


My lady likes to rub her fingers through my hair and I have thick ass curly hair so it’s always been a pet peeve, but when she does it I kid you not she damn near starts purring and she looks at me with those big blue eyes I just fucking melt."
"What are some reasons you didn’t want to date a girl?

"Ladies, please remember what this sub is for


This is meant as a kind reminder, not a rant... however:

&amp;#x200B;

I've seen a growing trend lately of women chiming in on men asking other men for advice about situations that require an answer from the male experience. The latest and potentially most egregious of these examples has been in the [""As a guy, how do you approach your girlfriend if you need emotional support?""](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskMen/comments/bkt0lg/as_a_guy_how_do_you_approach_your_girlfriend_if/) thread. This thread literally contains an example of a woman telling the OP to disregard advice from men, in an ask men thread. What's more, there seem to be instances of women in the thread disagreeing with comments coming from men that are construed as negative, which is **hilariously ironic** given the title of the thread. 

&amp;#x200B;

I don't want this to devolve into a continuation of that thread, it is meant in the abstract sense as a reminder to the ladies among us that, while we value your contribution, please don't attempt to contradict the advice given by men here. I would remind men not to do the same in askwomen. Just as men have no frame of reference for experiencing life as a woman, ladies, you do not (and never will) possess the experience required to administer advice to men from the perspective of the male experience."

"[serious] Older guys, assuming there was no affair, abuse, etc, how did you decide your marriage was over?


I'm married 20+ years. (Got married young.) Have a few great kids... But I think my wife and I are both about ready to tap out. We're in counseling, separately and together, and neither of us wants to say it's over, but it's obvious we're both wondering if it's possible to salvage. And if we want to fight through the long slog that it may entail.

Stories for me?"

"Men of reddit: How do I get over the fact my 20s were a failure compared to most other guys?


When I say failure, my 20s have genuinely been a complete failure on many levels. I am 28 and I can't move forward with my life because as I approach 30, all I feel is regret about a wasted youth. Some examples of my failures as a twentysomething guy:

* Never had the wild stage of life everyone else has when they hook up with lots of women (I've only slept with 3 and two of them were long-term relationships)
* Didn't particularly enjoy college, actually i kinda hated it. I chose the wrong degree but persisted with it anyway. My social anxiety prevented me from making friends until the last of my 4 years in college. I think 99% of men who go to college love it and have the time of their lives. 
* I haven't ever been in proper shape. I'm not obese but I've wasted the prime of my physical years in sub-optimal shape with a beer belly. I've never seen my abs.  
 * Career-wise, I've isolated myself by working online for the last 4 years while most other twentysomethings are in enjoyable office jobs with colleagues who they go for lunch with, go for drinks after work with, and even go on trips abroad with. 
* I've done a lot of solo travel and visited places like Thailand, Laos, Hungary, Malaysia, Australia. However, unlike most guys who travel alone, I mostly kept to myself and didn't really connect with anyone on my trips. 

So, did anyone else here not enjoy their 20s? This decade is pretty much always portrayed as the most fun decade of life but that hasn't been my experience at all."
"How should we celebrate Father’s Day with my childless boyfriend who acts as a father to my teenage son?


I’ve been with my boyfriend for nearly 3 years, he has no kids of his own, but he’s been awesome to my teenage son whose dad isn’t active in his life. 

He does yard work with him and teaches him how to use tools, how to weld etc. Helps me to understand teenagers... My son adores him.  I truly appreciate how he’s filled a gap in his life that I haven’t been able to. 

We’d like to do something for him for Father’s Day to show our appreciation, but I’m not sure what is appropriate for someone in his role? 

So my question is, would it be appropriate for us to get him a Father’s Day gift? And, if so, what would be some good budget gift ideas?

Tl;dr I have a wonderful boyfriend of three years who helps with my teenage son, we’d like to do something for him for Father’s Day, but aren’t sure what, since he’s in a non-traditional care taking role."

"How do I compliment straight men without them assuming I'm hitting on them?


I'm a lesbian, and I keep running into this problem where every man I compliment assumes I'm hitting on him. Dudes don't seem to get compliments often so I kinda decided it would be nice to compliment them when I see something worth complimenting, same I do to straight girls. Problem is they keep making it hard by just assuming it's flirtation. I'm pretty obviously gay, and I've also been trying ending compliments with ""dude"" to see if they take it better, but nothing works. I want to fix this, cause I'm not gonna keep complimenting guys if they keep assuming it's sexual and immediately try hitting on me."
