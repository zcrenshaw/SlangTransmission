"Have you ever had a dream which makes you sad after you wake up?


Fellas, have you ever had such a good dream where everything was coming up milhouse, only for you to wake up, and gain a feeling of instant depression because you came back to your ordinary life where all the thing's you've dreampt about were gone? It's a first time feeling for me, and I just gotta know that somebody else has had this.

&amp;#x200B;

For example, in my dream, I met this awesome chick and we were having this lovely conversation. Before I could ask her to a date, well...

&amp;#x200B;

I may actually have depression now."

I had a gf whose nickname for me was ""Hero"" and my ego fucking loved it, she would also do this thing where she'd arrange all of the pillows on my bed in adorable little patterns after she spent the night. Every person and relationship is so unique it's the little things that make me nostalgic"

"How to adjust to dating an ''influencer''?


Well, my girlfriend hates that word but so let's call her a social media marketer, since that is what her company is about. She's a Youtuber (750k subscribers) and has an Instagram (1.3m followers). She makes a buttload of money, travels everywhere, gets free stuff etc. and she's an amazing person, really patient, kind, diligent, enthusiastic. 
We've been together for 4 months now and she's asked if I want to be a part of her videos and I said no, not yet. She does weekly vlogs and ever since she said she's in a relationship, her audience has been pushing her to film me. She also goes to public events often and wants me to come, and one of the brands she's working with is taking her to Fiji in May and they gave her a +1 option since she's in a relationship, to take me with her.
I don't know how I feel about all of this, I want to continue living my calm, private life but at the same time I don't want her to feel like I'm ashamed of us and our relationship and I don't want us to miss out on the opportunities we have to experience things as a couple. 
I met her friends and associates who are also in the social media business and their male SO's are usually very involved, they appear in videos, go on trips, to events etc.
It makes me feel like I'm not doing enough for her while she really does go out of her way to make me feel loved and important "
"When your partner says 'I'm going to bed' earlier than usual - what do you think to do?


No unusual circumstances, my girlfriend said I'm going to bed early - about an hour earlier than usual, 9pm instead of 10pm.

I thought to myself - oh she must be tired, I'll be considerate and leave her be for a while to let her get some undisturbed sleep.

Upon coming to bed she was quite angry with me as it turned out she wanted some together time - I didn't pick this up however to which she responded ""how long have we been living together?"" (a year is the answer...).

So I'm wondering, when did ""I'm going to bed"" become a hidden meaning for, '...and I want you to come too because I feel we need some connection time'?"
"I am starting to realise my dad wont live forever, what are good places to go for a farther(53) son(22) trip?

"What’s your rock bottom story?


Need some inspiration on guys who made it out. Recently within the past month this is what’s happened:

-dumped by GF, proceeded to humiliate myself during breakup mode, bridge burned
-anniversary of mom’s death hit me like a ton of bricks
-relationship with family deteriorating
-grandfather died
-flunking college

As a result of this, I went to the hospital where the doctor said I had two weeks’ worth of panic attacks and it feels like a giant chore just to accomplish day-to-day activities. This all hit super fast and I’m trying to motivate myself to pull out of it. I’m trying to limit my drinking and how many hours I spend in bed. Any advice or other personal stories are greatly appreciated."
"Sons of single mothers, what was it like growing up.


 My mom was always working long hours and I rarely spent quality bonding time with her. This went on for so long that when she finally could afford to work less, the damage was already done and are behaviors normalized so that we barely interact at home. This lack of bonding time with the my remaining parent caused me to be socially awkward as I did not know how to act or how to dress. What about you guys? How were you affected?"
"How do you live a more interesting life when single/without relying on other people too much?


I got out of a relationship about 6 months ago now, and I feel like I haven’t moved on entirely, but largely due to the fact that my life is just boring now. All the social events and outings were either with her, or her friends group. I moved to the city, where I met her, for work, which is great, but I don’t know anybody here, and now that I’m single and no longer with her, my life has taken a noticeable plunge in terms of just generally being interesting at all.

Going to download Tinder and Bumble soon, hopefully that works, but don’t really want to rely solely on dates. That could end up being mostly just dinner/drinks which is cool, but my question to AskMen is... how do you make life more interesting without relying too heavily on others?"
"The word ""CUCK"" is now banned on this subreddit!


You heard me!

Due to a rising number of threads that get brigaded by low effort MGTOW trolls and other common household pests, we're banning the word ""cuck"" since you all love it so fucking much. As such it is now banned under the rule ""don't be an asshole"".

From today on automoderator auto removes any comment containing that word and leaves no reason. Since in 99% of cases it's used as a shitty insult to throw at people when you've been beaten in an online argument but don't want to feel like you lost (hint: writing ""LMAO WHAT A CUCK"" doesn't make you seem like a sane individual), or you disagree with someone's opinion. All of these get reported all the time under rule 1 (thanks community keep it up guys for real) and we're done dealing with it so we're going FULL AUTOMATION BABY

If you're actually serious about your comment, don't include the word. it's that simple.

The 1% of you that actually do want to discuss your adultery hobbies, you still have the official terms to work with anyway. That, and there's an actual subreddit for actual cucks.


time for FAQ!

Q: Isn't this censorship??

A: Yes

Q: But you can't do that!

A: Watch me

Q: BUT MUH FREE SPEECH

A: This is a private platform, deal with it

Q: You're a cuck!

A: You are just jealous because you cannot fuck my [hot russian wife](https://i.imgur.com/7XZBFNb.jpg)

have a nice day!"

"What's the dumbest thing you've seen someone do that led them to not getting a job?


I'm an engineer, my desk is in the front of the office so I usually work as a  receptionist if receptionist is on lunch. Doesn't bother me unless I'm on a conference call or something important. 

Dude comes in, says ""hey stopping by, just passing out resumes"" I was like ""Oh, I'm not a receptionist but let me see how I can help"" I called someone who also works as the back up and asked ""hey what's the process if someone just walks in?"" I send him over to the front desk area and we handed him a generic application to fill out, it's so we can put his information on file. He looked at it and said ""no that's not my thing, I dont do that"" and walked out. 

The funny thing is, I glanced at his resume, dude was qualified for a position we are trying to fill that we don't have posted anywhere, had he spent 5 minutes filling out the paper application, let us give it to HR, he probably would have gotten called in for an interview.

"I went to Taco Bell yesterday, ordered at the drive thru, paid for my food and absentmindedly drove off without my food when they handed back my debit card. What dumbfuck thing have you done recently?


So full story, work was butthole yesterday. Even when it gets busy it doesn't ruin my day that much, but the perfect storm of shitty things piled up yesterday and ruined my mood. On the drive home I said ""fuck it, not making dinner tonight"" and drove to Taco Bell.

While paying for my food, I'm just thinking, ""alright, just gotta get my burritos, go home, crack open a cold one, and I can start forgetting about today"". Then I started thinking that at least I'm lucky enough to have my own space to relax and unwind. I thought about people who had to go home to shitty families, or shitty relationships, or they had to go take care of their kids and hardly had time for themselves. 


Then I realized I had  driven off with my food. I was half a block away when this realization kicked in.  I just burst out laughing. Perfect. But mama didn't raise no bitch. I turned the fuck around and drove right back. Walked into the restaurant and said ""hey it's me, the idiot that forgot his food"". They laughed and handed me my bag. Went home, ate my authentic Mexican meal, played some Gorn, and overall had a good evening. 

What dumbshit dumbass thing have you done recently? 

TL;DR: Try the NEW Steak Rattlesnake Fries Burrito at participating Taco Bells near you!"

"Why do I feel bad even though I think I did the right thing?


So I was seeing this girl. She's a Barista from starbucks and I'm one of their regular customers. I think she was kinda cute, so sometimes I will stare at her at let her catch me stealing glances. Sometimes I'll throw a joke at her when I order. Time passed by and she sent me a friend request on facebook and that's how we started seeing each other.
We went out for dinner, eat street foods during her break and etc. Until I found out that she has a boyfriend.

So not an hour ago, I talked to her personally and told her that I really like her but I can't see her anymore. I asked her why she didn't told me at the first place and she said she didn't know why. I also said that we can be friends and she can tell me if she needs any help. but seeing her exclusively must stop.

I think I did the right thing , but I feel bad for myself."
"What’s the dumbest thing you’ve ever done because you were distracted by someone you’re really attracted to?

Also dropped my ice cream because I tripped on my own leg LOL I was again, looking at a girl I was talking with, l was with a group of friends and we were walking in the opposite direction as the girl so I turned my head to respond to her and ...next thing I knew everyone was dying of laughter at the guy who tripped himself

"What do I do about potential employer asking for pictures of me ""enjoying life""?


I'm applying for a new job and after I send a resume to this one place they email back with a link to a video, telling me to watch it then explain what excites me about working for them. In addition, I must also include two pictures of myself ""enjoying life"" because they're motto is ""We only hire happy people.""

Is this common? I find it a little weird. And if this is an actual requirement for the job that means I wont get it. I dont have any pictures of me enjoying life. None from the past 8 years or so at least. "

"It’s sexual assault awareness month. Men who have been groped, grabbed, and or have been forced into sex by a woman or another man, what’s your story?


I’ll start.  A couple of years ago, after coming home from a bar just off campus, I walked into my house and sat on my living room couch. My roommates threw a house party while I was at a bar. A girl walks up to me on the couch, looks at me being drunk and incoherent, and bets her friend that she can get me hard. She proceeds to hop on top of me, unzip my pants, and run her hand across the outside of my jeans in my groin area. She eventually got off and went back to the party. 

Another time, at a dinner banquet, while I stood talking to some friends with my girlfriend standing next to me, another girl, walked by me, looked at me, and reached for my groin. She half-smiled while I stood there shocked, and then pulled her hand away as she continued to walk. "
"How do you cope with being lonely and clingy?


For the past two weeks I noticed that I am very clingy with women I commit to talking on tinder. If a woman doesn't respond for a prolonged time I just jump to conclusions that she is not interested or that I did something wrong and I start to feel sad even though there is no basis for that. I must admit that this is after a few months when the first woman I loved ghosted me, but I still don't know how to deal with all of this"

My family is really short (parents are 5'5"" and 4'11 3/4"") two of my brothers are about 5'5"" and one is 5'10"". I'm 5'9"", so I'm tall for my family and I guess average for the general populace. I'm also 18 so I'm probably just about done growing. 
Am I short, though? I feel average in height, but I'm often made fun of by my friends for being short (they are shorter)."

"How do you stay interested in dating someone after getting to know them?


I've seen a lot of advice for men is to ask any cute girl you meet out (or just as many as possible).  
My issue is that even when I'm initially interested in someone, after a short conversation or just in general a short time after getting to know them, I lose all interest in dating them. This means that I never ask them out.  
I was wondering whether this is a somewhat common thing and how you stay interested in someone? I'm unsure whether it's an issue with me or with the people I meet.  
I've tried meeting people with common interests but even then I'd just rather be alone after some time with with them."

"How long should a woman expect a man to last in bed? Do you feel bothered if a woman has a hard time getting off?


Sorry if this is a dumb or frequent question. Will probably delete. Does it truly vary greatly? I've heard talk of guys lasting 20mins to even an hour... but that's what it seems like it is.. all talk. I've been with men ages 19 to 30 and they've all finished quite quickly. As in, if its longer than 3 minutes I'm lucky. Sometimes it might be 5 minutes. Is this the norm? No hate or judgement! I understand it's just the way men are wired, to get the job done for themselves. It just kind of leaves me wanting more and I'm not sure if this is all the usual or if this has just been my experience.

Also, is it annoying if a girl can't climax easily? Does it bother you? I'm not talking flings. I mean in a committed longterm relationship. Nature is truly a bitch. A few pumps and the man is all set and the lady hasn't gotten anywhere. Is it bothersome if a woman needs some time and effort put in to get off? Is it annoying if a woman needs/wants oral several times or for a while? (All reciprocated, of course.)

I guess it's just that I always hear about sex being so easy, effortless, enjoyable and earthshattering for everyone.. And I hear talk about guys lasting so long or performing oral for so long but haven't experienced any of that. I am obviously well aware porn is fake, btw, so please don't even bother yourself trying to explain what I already know. I'm not referring to porn, but to hearing other peoples experiences I guess! "
