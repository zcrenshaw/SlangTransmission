"How many kindergartners do you think you could personally take on in a fight before being overpowered?


Stipulations and context:

1. The kindergartners are released 5 at a time every 30 seconds.
2. The arena is a standard sized classroom, let's say 40 feet wide by 25 feet deep. However, the room is completely empty.
3. The kindergartners are unarmed. They are just going to run at you, attempting to punch, kick, bite, and scratch you. Their ultimate goal is to cumulatively dog pile on you and pin you to the ground. If they can pin you for 15 consecutive seconds, you lose.
4. You have to knock a kindergartner unconscious in order to defeat them. Once they are knocked unconscious, they vanish from the classroom arena.
5. You can use any strategy you want to fend them off, but you are also unarmed and you are not allowed to leave the room."
"What's the biggest bachelor/bachelorette party or wedding night fuck up you have seen?


So last night at the club I saw a bride and groom come in straight from the wedding while still wearing their dress and suit. He looked a little overwhelmed. She just immediately hit the dance floor and started grinding on random guys. After a couple of drinks and a pep talk from the best man he hit the floor and started dancing/kissing a random girl making sure she saw. I'll give their marriage 3 months.

Anyways what fuck ups have you guys seen?"

"Dads of teenage girls: Have you had bad experiences in public with people thinking you're a creep when you're just hanging out with your kid?


A few years ago, a friend of ours was buying some beer at the gas station. He had his 17 year old daughter with him, and the clerk got all weird about it and wouldn't sell him the beer because he didn't believe she was his daughter. 

My husband is now mortified that this will happen to him with our 16 year old daughter. I told him not to worry about it, but then I remembered an interaction my dad had:

He took me school shopping when I was a teenager, and a lady came up to my dad and made some comment about me being ""awful young"", and he practically yelled ""SHE'S MY DAUGHTER!""

Is stuff like this common for dads of teenage girls?"

"Gentlemen, what's your go-to solution for being with a girl who likes being loud in bed without annoying your flatmates?


I'm 32 and live with a couple in their mid 30s.  Not once have I heard them have sex, I can wholeheartedly admit.  We're super respectful of each other, even if he doesn't understand doors don't need to be slammed at times and that turning on a dishwasher almost means it needs to be emptied.  But I digress, could be worse.

Part of me is thinking ""adults have sex, I've been woken up a few times in my life, I don't care what they think.""

Another part me is think ""I don't want to be that guy and make them annoyed or uncomfortable.""

This girl I'm seeing is way younger than me at 26, and she...yeah, she's loud.  It's great, we're clawing at each other when she comes over once a week or 2 depending on work.  But I'm having to remind her to keep it down, and it's ruining the fun for me too as she's the first to be so damn enthusiastic about me.  Who knew sex is so much better when she's in to it like this girl.

I'm thinking hotel room some times, but is that way too ""sleazy""?"
"As a gay man, I've felt that straight men treat me differently than they treat their straight friends in that they're never completely themselves around me. What is it like from the perspective of a straight man to be friends with a gay man? I want to understand the other side.


I just want to understand the breakdown that happens between us here. My friendships with straight guys never seem to go as deep emotionally as my female friends do, which leads to a very unfulfilling relationship that feels almost like a ghost of a friendship. I'm passing no judgement here, and I'd really love to have a conversation and begin a dialogue."

"Men of Reddit, have you ever been walked in on while with your partner? When, where, and who?


The reason I ask cause it happened a few days ago.  My tinder FWB and I, were hooking up in my room before she goes off to college one last time. And right when things start to really take off, my dad knocks and opens the door. He says “oops sorry” and closes the door. When she walked out of the house my dad said “Hope to see you soon, I am sorry I interrupted, have a safe drive”. God, I love my dad."

"Fellas, how did you deal with the flagrant emotions of an ex after getting cheated on?


Gf and I broke up about a month ago after she told me she cheated on me and at first I was an absolute mess of depression and anxiety.

Now that I have somewhat collected myself (still in bad shape, but handling it better than I was the first week or 2), I can't help but feel anything but spite, hate, and anger towards her. 

Am I justified in feeling this way? Is this common at this stage of a breakup, specifically after being cheated on? What do I do to get better?

I have already taken some steps to get myself on the road to a better mental state by starting therapy and journaling daily. Any other advice would be greatly appreciated."

"What has been your most frustrating moment of an attempted invalidation of your hobbies/interests?


Last weekend, I experimented and went to a bar by myself for the first time. While I was there, a woman took interest in me and struck up a conversation. It was going relatively well until she asked me about my hobbies and interests. I mentioned a few things, and eventually I got to mentioning that I like to play Pokemon Go. Immediately the tone shifted, and she started treating me like I was radioactive. 

""Don't you think it's time to stop playing kids games?""

I responded, ""Don't you think it's a little bit rude to tell other people you barely know how to live?""

With that, she walked away and actually left the bar. My intent wasn't to hurt her or anything, but I was pretty taken aback by her comment and let her know I wasn't a doormat.

What are some of your experiences?"

Mine was a month before my daughter was born. My wife and I took a baby moon and visited our very dear friends, a couple with teenage boys.

At the end of an incredible five days, the wife was dropping me and my wife off at the airport. Hugs were going around and she whispered to me “You’re  going to be a great dad! Your little girl has now idea how awesome she’ll have it.”

Cue the water works, we walk into the terminal and my wife asks why my face is leaking and just responds with “I know. “"

Because of the unwritten rule of not approaching a girl while she’s working out, there doesn’t seem to be a secondary option unless you get lucky and find someone out in public which often times is hard to tell if she’s in shape underneath her clothes. 

As someone who’s heavily invested into fitness and overall being healthy and taking care of my body, I genuinely have a hard time being attracted to women who don’t care enough about their health.

What spots do you find you have the most luck with?"
