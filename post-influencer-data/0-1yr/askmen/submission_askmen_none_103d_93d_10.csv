Mine was the first night we did anything sexual, about 2 months into the relationship. We were cuddling in her room in her bed, I left to go to the bathroom. I came back and her door was locked, and when I asked if she was okay she opened the door wearing just a shirt that I gave her and nothing else. I took the hint and her initiating it made it so much hotter. Fun times immediately followed. 

Needless to say, I was surprised."

"What are some ways you break the touch barrier to show a woman you’re interested?


We all know that a common way for a woman to flirt/ show interest is touching a man on the arm, letting it linger, etc. I know that some men don’t want to come across as creepy or assuming too much so what are some ways or tricks that you touch a woman on the first few dates to show her that you’re interested in her? 

And I’m not talking about being interested in a quick hook-up and getting things to escalate quickly. I’m talking genuine, “I like you and want to get to know you better” kind of interest."

He then sent: We should hang out sometime and have a jam together if your up for it

I'm just interested because these can be very random.

I had another friend who was most jealous of physicists, including the guy above. That friend was part of the staff of a community college."
"What was the moment that made you go ""wow she/he must really really love me""?


Possibly gross/cringe story ahead;

So I knew my boyfriend loved me already but a couple of months ago I was really sick (not like cancer or anything but just sick). Then I got my period on top of that and started cramping way way worse than I usually do to the point I had to be escorted to the toilet cause I was legit that weak. So he escorts me to the toilet and leaves me to do my business.  After a while he checks up on me and finds me struggling to open a pad so I can change. Without saying a word, he took it from me, opened it and swapped the one I was wearing with a new one. I was super embarrassed but I remember lying in my fever haze thinking, wow he must really really love me/he's the greatest to do that for me. He's probably erased that incident from his memory but I still remember and it really makes me want to be a better partner to him.

tl,dr: he changed my menstrual pad for me."

"Men who've been in a workplace setting where it was predominantly women and you were the minority, what was it like?


From my experience:

* They often forget it's not just all women anymore and frequently air out dirty laundry as if it's perfectly acceptable. This is stuff that wouldn't even be considered okay for locker room talk.

* They are always eager to discuss your personal life with you in the workplace even if you don't want to and pry about your relationships, feelings etc.

* Would always end up being the one asked to do the heavy lifting

* Asked to fix every possible IT issue

* Complaints about co-workers, personal issues, disagreements would be addressed first and faster than workplace improvements, productivity, etc.

* An inner circle would form where women would meet and gossip with their female superiors

* If I spent a considerable amount of time working alongside a particular female colleague on a task or chat at the water cooler, one coworker would spread a rumour to the other women on how she thought I had feelings for this person, hampering my ability and reputation to network and build professional relationships with colleagues.

* Trying to join conversations with the intent of being helpful was reported to superiors as mansplaining, hostile, and being talked-down to if they were sitting down and I walked over (standing) to help them at their desk

* Always have to act interested when they discuss their kids and family or you end up on their bad side"

"Men, what is the thing that makes you decide to pursue a girl romantically or just friend zone her?


I(F) met a friend (M) recently after a long time. Eventually, we got talking about our school days. I ask him about this friend of mine, who I thought he liked at the time, and whether he ever told her. He starts laughing and says he never thought of her that way and she was just a buddy. Now the reason this was a surprise to me is that she would behave very differently around him and it was obvious to a lot of us.

Cut to a week later and I'm talking about this to another friend(F) of mine. She says she also liked this one guy a while back and they used to hang out with each other all the time, but she never could make him see her as more than a friend.

 So guys of Reddit, how do you decide whether the woman is your future SO or just a  female buddy?"

"What are some ways unattractive girls can get your (positive) attention ?


I'm unattractive, I take care of myself and try and look put together but the simple reality is that not all of us, Male or female are  attractive.

What I'm wondering is how can an unattractive girl catch the attention of a guy who she doesn't know that well, in a positive way. Of course I know that being kind, funny and intelligent are positive things, but most of those things are revealed about a person upon getting to know them. What I'm asking thus, is what are some ways, if any, that is not so pretty girls can get that initial spark of positive attention, so that we can start to try and develop more of a friendship or relationship with a guy?

Thank you :)!"
"What are some (now obvious) things about your body that you can’t believe your dad never told you about?


Woman here (37/f). As I’ve gotten older I’ve noticed things about my body that I can’t believe my mom didn’t tell me. It just wouldn’t made things easier. Like “hey your vag will experience climate change and that’s normal.” I’m curious if men, at any stage in life, experience/notice something similar? Like “hey wish dad had told me X about managing my balls.” Heightened awareness prob bc I have a kid now (15 months/f) and I’m like “oh I’m def gonna remember to tell her X about having a vagina.”"

"Do males masturbate to the thought of their female friends? If yes, why?


This might be a weird question, but I [18, F] just read about it in another thread and thought I'd ask. A few years ago I found out that one of my closest male friends did this, but I didn't think it was common, so I haven't really thought much about it since. Now, most of my friends are guys and the thread made me wonder if it is more common than I would like to think. Now I ask you, is it? And if yes, is there a reason or just because you find someone attractive?"

"Have you ever dated a significantly older woman? How did it go?


So I started a new job where I met this older woman 46, whose been showing me the ropes of the job.

We get along really well despite the age gap. We share a lot of the same life philosophies and have had many similar experiences and really click on a personal level. I ended up looking up to her more than just in a work way.

I found her attractive the first time I saw her and found her admirable considering the things she's been through. But my feelings were that of how you would crush on a teacher. Didn't really think much of it aside from checking her out on the sly occasionally and knew nothing would come of it.

Anyway, she asked me to get a drink after work one time. Didn't think anything of it, we were purely platonic and I get drinks with men and woman all the time and it never feels like anything other than platonic.

While we were out, we talked a lot about our personal lives and shared a lot of deep feelings on life. Still, didn't think anything of it. I have these talks with a lot of people.

But it wasn't until we were talking about interests and laughing that I realized this felt like a date. And realized I actually liked her more than just a crush. I actually started to have feelings for her.

I figured it was just one sided and me just being stupid. But the next time we got a drink she actually brought up that she sensed there was a mutual attraction between us.

I was pretty floored and bumbled around like an idiot. But she said she's not in the position to have anything right now at the moment because of her recent divorce and didn't want to scandalize her kids with a new person in their lives. So I don't think anything more will happen.

I feel pretty upset with myself for developing feelings and getting myself in this situation.

I'm definitely not lonely or desperate and jumping on the first thing I see. I've actually had a pretty healthy dating life the past year, but never really clicked with any of the girls.

Now I meet this woman and all of a sudden I like her. I feel like an idiot. I dated all these woman before her and never clicked with any of them like I do with her. In fact, I never gave a shit about any of them. Not in a I wouldn't care if they got hurt way, more in a I wouldn't care if we broke up way.

If any of my friends were in my position I would tell them to get over themselves and don't get caught up in anything.

But sense I'm in it, I feel like it's more complicated than that.

Give it to me straight Reddit. Call me a moron and bring me to my senses and move on from this."

"What is the appropriate way to handle a male friend who is pursuing your girlfriend?


I've got a friend who was friends with my girlfriend before I started dating her. He and I have a good time when its just he and I. When He, my girlfriend, and I hang out it can be a bit of different story. Gf and I have been dating for about 3 years now, great relationship, no problems. I can sense my ""friend"" is envious of what Gf and I have and most recently has taken to trying to invite her to hang out excluding me. She shuts this down or always directly includes me which feels great to be validated in this way. Should I bother even continuing to hang out with this guy or should I cut contact and end our friendship? I am not threatened by his advances they just make me feel hurt for being foolish enough to think he wanted my friendship and not my girlfriend. My intuition tells me that even though he may actually want to be my friend in some sense, he wants my girlfriend more than that. He would deny this if I called him out on it because I honestly don't even think he's self aware enough to know that he's allowing his uglier emotions take control.

&amp;#x200B;

What should I do? I would never do this to one of my friends, and though I don't sense he is malicious necessarily its still makes me feel like somewhat of a fool for trying to continue and maintain our friendship. When its he and I its actually all good, but his actions around my girlfriend make me wonder if its just an act (The only way he can hang out with my girlfriend is if I invite him to chill with us so he would have motivation to pretend to be my friend in this scenario.) I've searched my feelings and did some really blunt and honest introspection, I am not being paranoid and I think my desire for friendship and camaraderie is causing me to project what I want to see onto a person who does not have my interests in mind."

"MEN, how have your tastes in women changed as you got older/more successful?


Seeing Jeff Bezos and his affair partner, now GF... I am left to wonder... as men get older and more successful, is it true that their taste in women change.. they want bare-it-all and shallower women who will attend to their needs and worship them?

Case in point, I see a few of acquaintances have questionable affairs or get divorces to go for non-reputable women.

A close friend recently-successful fiend of mine who used to like girl-next-door types now often share photos of plastic-surgery barely-clothed instagram ""models"" and often commenting how ""beautiful"" they are.

Men of reddit, any grounds to this theory?  Care to share how your tastes have changed over the years?  Was success a factor?"
