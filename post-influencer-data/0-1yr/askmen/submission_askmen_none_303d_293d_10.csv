"How do you deal with lowering your standards for physical appearance?


Theres no way around it.

I'm not an attractive guy. 

My whole life I've been teased about the way I look, and a lot of it is shit beyond my control. 

Sure I could be in better shape, and I am currently working towards it. But the way my head is shaped is kind of fucked. 

I always shoot my shot with girls I think are cute, but I never quite make it.

 I tend to swipe right on everything, and the Tinder girls that I match with don't really do it for me. 

Some people told me to just drop my standards a bit and get experience.

The thing that bothers me is, I'm not out here chasing super models. I usually don't event try with girls that level anyway, or even a level below that.

Its hard to explain but I don't think my standards are super high. I just like cute girls, but those cute girls don't seem to like me. 

So when people say drop your interest to a low level that your not even into, what do you do?

Has anyone ever been in the same scenario?

I appreciate any advice "

"Any dudes who know about WW2, what next WW2 film should be made?


I know there is a lot and Overlord is pretty much one but I feel like they need to make more films like a Band of Brothers or Dunkirk where they make a lot of the action sequences and background Very realistic. IDK but digging an WW2 Africa film, Monte Cassino film, Entering of Germany by US forces, and even some films on the German perspective."
"How expressive are you with the person you are dating? Is it compatible with how expressive they are? If not, how did you find a balance?


I have recently started dating someone I really like. Except he is very expressive with words about  spending time with me and doing activities which I, for now, would rather do with my friends. Basically a lot of compliments and sweet things. He is clearly more in touch with himself than I am.

A little background: He was in a long term relationship before while the longest I've been is a month and a half which was about 4 years ago. I am used to being alone, so I am still getting used to changing this around. Especially for someone I JUST started dating.

I really do like him, but I think I am just moving at a slower pace than he is. Maybe in a few more dates, I'll be where he is. But I don't know how to approach this with him without making him feel bad. Or him completely backing off because I do think this does have a future."
"Hey mens of reddit: How do you approach girls?


Hey people,

so this is quiete a problem for me and i never figured it out myself despite the fact that i had a couple girlfriends already: How do you approach girls?

Im trying not to be arrogant, but let me start with this: I think of myself as a quiete "" attractiv"" person, obviously thats a matter of taste. 

I can speak alot and i like to speak with a variety of people. I always try to be part of the conversation, no matter what it is about and no matter where i am at the time. In clubs, parties, college, school... i always tried to be someone that gets noted for what he does.

Im 25 right now but i never had a girlfriend so far, which i aproached myself to get in contact to. Every single girlfriend i had so far, came to me and tried to get in contact with me, i never did the same myself. I don't say this because i think ""oh im so cool girls are just coming to me"", i say this legitimately because i don't know how to approach girls. I remember trying it once and i got rejected. It's like 5 years ago but i still remember it every single time i try to overcome this feeling when i like a girl around me. It's frustrating to the very least and it also feels like im not beeing myself at the same time. I always feel like i have to be someone else to attract the girl i am interested in. I also never broke up with any of my girlfriends myself, i just let it happen from their side despite knowing im in a non succesfull relationship - somehow it worked..

I am single for a good 2 years now and i gotta say... it feels fuckin awfull... I sometimes think it's my lakk of selfconfidence, but when i think of that i also get the feeling that i'm way ahaed of myself and start to reconsider everything i have done so far...

Im really lost sometimes and maybe somebody can give me advice, anything is aprecciated.

"What is something annoying that someone says to you that undervalues something else that you like about yourself?


Mine is when my above-average (6'5"") height comes into conversation, then someone points out my skinniness like my height doesn't matter because of it. I mean I'm not even that skinny, I just have the body type of someone who keeps relatively fit and has thin-ish bones (I'm insecure about it, I know).

Another example (not me) is when you have been on an intense workout regime, watch what you eat, then some unhealthy person says something dumb like ""you're so lucky. I wish I had your genetics"".

For the sake of variety, it could also be a non-physical comment such as saying your voice sounds funny after you've been nice to them or explained something you're an expert in.

I was just thinking after reflecting on a few recent conversations that I have had. Not that this matters that much, but it's mostly women who tend to make these remarks. 

So, fellow men, do you have any personal examples that also annoy you? "

"How do you overcome Anxiety when asking a woman out?


So I play volleyball about twice a week at a local rec center. There's a girl who's started coming there about a few months ago and I've wanted to ask her out. Now, I've been in this situation before where I think of everything that can go wrong. Part of me wants to be the big, confident, ""Macho"" guy who just walks up to her, asks if she has a boyfriend, and then asks to take her out to dinner. Anyway, here are some of the thoughts my anxiety has cooked up to keep me from being direct and confident.

​

 1. We've never really talked, only played on a team together once. So she barely knows me and might think I'm weird for asking her out just out of the blue.

 2. She knows most of the people there whereas I do not. So if I ask her out she will tell everyone and then I'll be ousted as the ""weird guy"".

 3. It's just not the right time/setting. We're all here to just play volleyball and have fun, not try to pick up the girls who play here. It just seems scummy.

​

I know that these are all just anxiety talking and I shouldn't have a reason to be afraid, but it still just freezes me in place. All I want to do is walk up to her and ask her out. It's simple, but it's like my mind won't let it be that simple. Any tips to psych myself out or advice to handle the situation better?"

"What's the most unbelievable excuse you've gotten for a date being cancelled? One you just knew was bullsh*t.


I once had a girl I met on tinder who worked at the zoo. We texted for about 2 weeks before we were supposed to meet up and take our dogs out for a walk.

The day of, she texted me and said, ""hey I can't make it today. There's a bird loose at the zoo and I'm on call. I'm sorry.""

I was so stunned, I just rolled with it like it was true. We never talked again after that."

First off I'm a guy.

I was talking with this acqusntaince of mine and she mentioned she showers every 3 days or so. I was disgusted. I shower at least once a day, sometimes twice. I can't imagine going a full day without bathing. 

Her argument is that it causes skin problems to shower so much. She might be right, but I feel *nasty* When I don't shower for a while. "
"Men, how important is it for you to feel like you can provide?


Does it matter if your partner or spouse works too? What if that person makes more than you do: does that reduce the  pressure? If you have kids, did the pressure increase at that time? If you could take a job you like more, but it would involve a pay cut and tightening up your expenses, would that be viable for you? 

I do feel a need to provide (and I work FT), but job satisfaction is way more important to me, and I'll tighten the purse strings to make a lower income work. I know my husband is on a very different page from me on this issue, and my brother and guy friends have said similar things. Whether my salary has been higher or lower has not made a difference overall to how he feels on the issue."
