"What was the idiotic game you and your stupid friends played growing up?


My buddies and I used to turn all the lights out in the basement and throw those giant exercise balls through the pitch blackness in random directions trying to hit each other. The fear, the anticipation, and the sound of the ball whistling through the dark. The game had only downsides and shouldn't never have been created."

"Men of Reddit, how do you deal with the waiter flirting with your date?


I clicked with this girl on Tinder and we decided to get drinks at Bahama Breeze (not the fanciest place but good enough for college kids) the other night. We met and everything was going great. We were sitting at the bar because she wanted to, and getting to know each other when the waiter comes over to ask for our drinks. 

She orders a Margarita and he goes, ""Really? I thought you'd be more of a pina colada kind of girl."" She goes, ""Oh, what makes you say that?"" And he says something I don't remember, but they start CONVERSING back and forth and I'm sitting behind there awkwardly like uhh. I mean, I'm usually pretty loud, but I didn't want to come off as being jealous or whatever so I just kept my mouth shut until I found an opportunity to jump into the conversation and chimed in with my opinion. He then *FINALLY* noticed me and asked if I wanted anything and I order a Mai Tai and he's like alright man let me get that for ya. 

Easy mistake I thought, he probably thought she was single considering she was sitting at the bar? Whatever. I'm not letting him get to me. Anyway, we start talking until he comes back with our drinks and he looks at her and goes, ""I got you 2 pineapples in your drink because you're special, but don't tell my boss or I'd get into trouble."" At this point I'm starting to get slightly annoyed but he walks away immediately after that instead of staying to talk so it wasn't that bad. 

We're now ordering food and I order just the salad because I actually like their salad. She orders fish tacos and he uncreatively (same fucking line as before) goes, ""haha, I pictured you more to be a Steak kind of girl."" And she replies with I LOVE steak, I was just ordering these because he *points at me* ordered the salad. I just shrugged like haha.. they then start talking about restaurants around Gainesville that serve good food and I just pull out my phone because I'm done at this point. 

After he leaves, I excuse myself to use the restroom and when returning, I see him at our table AGAIN talking to her. By the time I walk to my chair, he's making her laugh and he walks away after seeing me. I am completely thrown of any game. He was also kind of good-looking so it threw me off even more since I'm not nearly as physically attractive. 

At the end of the night, I ask her if she'd like to go for a walk outside but she says no because she's meeting her roommate here later. She gave me a hug goodbye. 

So, men of Reddit, how would you have dealt with the waiter in this scenario? "

"Sometimes I just curl up in my bed and cry, how do you cope with failing?


   Sometimes I just curl up in my bed and cry, how do you cope with failing? I'm 22 I turn 23 in April. I don’t know where to post this, this might even get taken down But. Past few years for me have been hard, from being Suicidal and attempted Twice. I don’t and haven’t felt right mentally and emotionally. From spending more time in Community College than I should have to graduating and being unsure of what I want to do when I have to go back to school. 

   To realizing I’m not getting younger, and only older and time is not on my side. It’s a rollercoaster of emotions that I can’t seem to express to anyone. Because even those closest to you eventually get tired of listening, my mom I feel has grown tired and my dad gave up years ago it seems. 

   I Feel like there’s this cloud of pressure of who people say I am vs. who I am because I don’t even have that answer. 

   I Wake up every day dreading how I will make it through feels like I’m suffocating. 

   I Got, so much on my mind and have failed so many times I wonder if it’s worth trying anymore. I Gave up on all my hobbies, Drawing, Skating. I Constantly compare my life with others my age and hate myself because, of who I am at this stage in life. 

Sorry for the rant, But, the Question. How have you guys overcome these feelings?

"How is/was dating after college?



I’m a senior in college and will be graduating in May. 

I recently got out of a 1.5 year relationship with a girl who I saw a future with, but unfortunately she fell out of love with me. I have been told that I am amazing and an incredible boyfriend/person, but I am worried that finding a great girl after graduation will be difficult due to working a lot and not being around tons of single girls. 

I’m not one to go to bars/parties - mostly the gym and church. I still have 2 months left in college, but instead of looking for someone, I’m still trying to learn from my past relationship, become an even better man, and work on friendships. 

Has anyone dated after college? How’d it go? I’m not looking for hookups, I’m into long term relationships.

In high school, about 1990, I loaned an acquaintance my guitar. It was a hot pink Dean guitar, my first guitar, the one my parents got for me in 7th grade. Dude I loaned it to said nothing about it until I asked for it back, when he told me it was ""stolen"". Stupid me didn't ask for any proof, no police report, nothing. I just let the dude steal it from me. It's not like I didn't care, why didn't I do something about it? Yeah, I'm still mad.

"How did you guys get back your zest for life?


These few weeks, I've felt more and more like I am almost losing the will to live. I feel tired and weak all the time, and just feel like nothing is worth it.

I'm only 25 and I feel like this is my life now. Work, home, work, home. I don't have the urge to go out or do anything outside the norm and I almost feel like a zombie. I do smoke (well vape) a copious amount of weed, so that might be a factor, although for the sesh I feel a lot better than I normally do.

"Female here. What's the best way to offer to pay on the first date?


So here's some backstory, I went out on a date with a guy before I meet my ex and at the end, I offered to split the bill. He said no. I asked if he was sure and he kind of snappy said I can pay for dinner. It got awkward because I felt like I offended him. Fast-forward to my ex we went out on our first date a few weeks later coming off that experience I didn't offer to pay, but I made same sure to pay for everything on our second date and from there we just took turns with everything and anything big we did we split down the middle. So where on like our fourth date some of his friends are over at his house and one of his friends is talking about his he went out with a girl in the city drove the hour and a half to meet her and then ran up a two hundred dollar bill and she didn't offer to pay. He was offended, felt like she could have offered he wouldn't have accepted but still. So now I feel guilty because I didn't offer to pay on the first date with my ex. (I asked and he said he didn't trip off of it and he appreciated the splits and taking turns). So on to my most recent date, its going okay.  The bill comes i grab my purse go in and grab my wallet so i can offer to split the bill.

 my date pauses and he's like ""what are you doing?""

Me: ""splitting the bill?"" 

Him (perturbed): ""if I couldn't afford to feed you I wouldn't have asked you out?"" 

So I didn't really know what to say to that, so yeah. Is this whole offering /splitting/going Dutch thing not a thing (speaking of going Dutch where does that saying come from?) Is it a thing and I'm just doing it wrong. I'm confused. 

Look I just want to be a responsible and respectful adult. Part of that is paying your way. I always hear about men feeling like their being used for a free meal or drinks and that it would be nice to not always have to pay for everything and I get it I would feel that way too. But I'm trying my best to exercise some home training here you know the be courteous and don't go anywhere or do anything if you can't afford to get home thing. 

So is it me? Is it the men I'm out with or am I just not doing it right?

"How do you guys deal with your girlfriend’s guy friends making sexual comments at her?


This happened a lot with my ex and it’s happening to the current girl I’ve been talking to but it’s something that’s always bothered me. Even when she rejects their advances it makes me sad that she still hangs with them and considers them good friends. I just think it makes it clear that her friends don’t respect me or our relationship. 

I feel like I’m just being too insecure and it seems like if I ever talk to any decently attractive girl this will happen. So how can I not be bothered by this? Is it just a normal thing for guys to flirt with their friends that are girls?"

"How to deal with feeling like there is an emptiness inside you where nothing can fulfill you or give you purpose?


I feel empty inside, like my life has no purpose and my words no meaning. I feel I’m not making an impact on anyone and nothing matters. I’m just drifting through life and nobody really cares about me and I don’t even value myself. I do anything I can just to feel something, anonymous sex, drugs, alcohol, food... anything that’ll take away the pain and hopelessness. I drink a lot. I’m lonely and sad. I don’t see any joy in the world anymore.

"How do you ""ground yourself"" and stop overthinking?


To be quite honest, I feel like I've been cursed with the burden of my own head. There are days where I feel almost paralyzed by what amounts to an overthinking spiral. 

I have the self-awareness to realize that what I'm thinking is almost certainly irrational, but trying to counter it with more positive thoughts doesn't seem to work very well. 

Does anyone have any thoughts about how one can ""ground themselves"" and stop overthinking things? I talked to an expert about a year ago for stress-related problems, I'm thinking I may have to go back, but I'd like to get other perspectives on this if any of you guys have encountered this before.

I'd give more context to what I'm feeling, but this sub has enough relationship posts and I don't want to bore people. Besides, I'm having trouble explaining this without making my own emotional immaturity plain to see."
