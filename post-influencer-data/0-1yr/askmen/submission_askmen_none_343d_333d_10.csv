Any recommendations welcome but I’m hoping to hear from thinner guys with brands that fit well."
"What does it mean when men stare?


This one guy keeps turning around in our lecture that has 300+ ppl to stare at me. I don't know what it means, but it's starting to make me uncomfortable &amp; I don't look at him back I just try to glance away. 

He's a preppy white guy &amp; honestly his type is never into me they mainly go for white girls, so I don't really have the confidence to like approach him to ask him to stop or why he is doing it.  

I know someone staring @ you could mean a lot of things, but I don't know if I should just confront him after lecture.. or if it will make it more awkward...

"Fucked up hair, need advice


So I have decently long curly hair and about a year or two ago I noticed a long patch of hair right under my hairline on my forehead. I panicked and shaved it off with a razor, I did that again tonight but it’s still pretty visible after I shaved it and it’s gonna grow back. Do I just keep shaving it off my whole life? Do I let it grow out? Do I wait until it’s long until to pull each one of those hairs out?"

"I don‘t understand why she isn‘t being straight with me.


I met a girl (lets just call her Sophia) at my working place (she left a couple days ago to study law) and got very attracted to her. I had no contact to her after she left to study in a different city, so I asked her girlfriend to write and tell her that I had a crush on her and wanted to get to know her better. Sophia replied with (yeah sure give him my instagram name so we can text and see where it‘s going). I heard the audio and she spoke very monotone which kinda disappointed me but I thought ""Hey, at least she is giving me a chance... I guess."". I‘m texting with her at the moment but I just don‘t know what she wants. First, it takes hours for her to reply to my messages and I started mirroring her and doing the same. Second, she never asks me any questions. I’m always the one to keep the conversation going. Then if I ask her out she says that she has no time or even weirder: She wants to meet ""us"" as soon as she can at our WORKING PLACE. What?! I don‘t know what that the purpose of a 30 min meetup with me and her girlfriend is. I mean why isn‘t she just telling me that she isn‘t interested in me if she is not or is she just shy? Does anybody have experience with this scenario? I‘m kinda getting mad at her and would rather want to know if she is into me or not instead of wasting my time."

"Asked a guy out, he said yes, set a vague time for this afternoon but I’m waiting around with no word—guys, how much initiating is too much?


So basically like the post says, I met a guy the other day, felt a little connection there, got his number and we texted literally the whole day. Next day I asked him if he wanted to grab drinks sometime and he said yes, asked me when I was off work.  We set a place and he said Saturday afternoon would be good and we could “play the time by ear.”  I told him that was fine and to just let me know.  He enthusiastically agreed and I haven’t followed up since then. 

Well here we are on Saturday afternoon and I haven’t heard from him.  I’m kind of loathe to text and ask him if we’re still on, because that just seems like I’d definitely be coming on too strong if I haven’t already.  Another part of me doesn’t really give a crap and just wants to know if I need to put makeup on. 

Ancient female wisdom states that if he really wants to meet up, he’ll make it happen—but what do the guys say?  Do I text him or am I already ghosted and need to let it go? "

"How should I tell a guy friend of mine that I’m interested in more?


An old friend of mine from high school recently reached out to me after about 4-5 years of no communication. 

Long story short, we caught up with each other, have been talking for 3 months, and have been hanging out/planning more hang outs with each other. We get along really well and I’m starting to like him as more than a friend, but how do I ease into telling him how I feel? 

I’m not sure if he feels the same way and I want to express it in a way that makes it clear that I’m interested, but that I’m also okay with staying friends if he’s not. I don’t know exactly when or how to bring this topic up while we’re hanging out. "

"How do you walk into a new place/club/group with confidence to strike up conversation and make friends? How to overcome the initial social anxiety?


I’m interested in joining some outdoor recreation clubs to meet more friends, but I’ve always had a really hard time making friends unless we have a mutual friend. I’m good enough at conversation (once it’s initiated), and people tend to like me, but I tend to over think and get anxious when I meet new people. It leads me to avoid joining new clubs or just hide in a corner when I do. 

What kind of mentality should I have?"
"What do his actions mean if he treats me well, but doesn’t really let his friends know about me?


My crush and I have been getting along really well over the past few months and have been going out often. Today, we went to the ocean, and I posted a few pictures of the views, with one including him. Turns out his friend had asked him to hang out today too, and he had told that friend that he couldn’t because he had something important to do. Anyways, his friend saw the pictures I shared, and is now upset at him, who is now in turn upset at me for sharing without asking him first. I apologized, and he responded with it’s ok, but I feel like it’s really not ok. I feel really bad, but I also feel a bit confused. The thing is, when I had asked him earlier today about how that friend was doing, he said he hadn’t talked to that friend for about a month now. The second thing is, I feel like he’s making excuses to his friends about what he’s doing whenever he’s out with me. Last time we studied together, I recommended a nearby Starbucks, and he wanted to go somewhere else because he said he doesn’t want to run into someone he knows, because he had cancelled on his friends to go out with me. Third, he doesn’t share anything of us (although he really just doesn’t post in general). I don’t know if he is embarrassed and doesn’t want his friends to know about me, or if none of this really means anything; I’m confused because he treats me really well when we’re out together (for example today: he woke up early just to drive me an hour and a half to my testing center this morning, then went to the ocean with me, despite being so tired from driving and waking up so early). Can someone tell me what his actions mean?"
