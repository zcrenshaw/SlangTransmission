"Why do we have to work such long hours every week?


I spend every day at work mostly on reddit for 3-4 hours a day, and get all of my work done in about 4-5 hours. I am extremely efficient and always do my job well. I do not feel bad at all for dicking around the other times I’m done. The 40 hour workweek is outdated and needs to be redone in modern times. I actually work 47 hours a week, so it’s even worse. It does not make me feel lazy. Im here for a purpose and I get that purpose finished faster than others might. So GODDAMN be it."

"I woke up to my roommate standing in my room, he’s male. What do?


I’m probably gonna delete this, I just need feed back. 

He was well into my room, because when I shot up out of bed he was surprised and stumbled backwards knocking into my mirror and other shit onto the ground. The only two reasons I can think of is, 1. He didn’t think I was home and wanted to snoop through my room/steal shit. Or 2. He knew I was asleep and wanted to do something bizarre maybe possibly homosexual. I’m thinking about asking my dad what I do about it. This is beyond strange, I’ve only known the dude for a month. This would be bizarre if my old roommate of 3 years did something shit like this, but I’m very weirded out right now. 

I’m much stronger and fitter than he is, so I’m not necessarily concerned about being overpowered it’s just like what if I don’t wake up? What’s he gonna do? "

"How do I get a bat out of my room? It's been in there all day.


I woke up around 5 in the morning today, to the sound of flapping. I looked up and saw a bat flying around. I opened my window as far as it goes, hoping it'd fly out, but it was suddenly no where to be seen. I looked around but couldn't find it. So I went back to bed. This morning I figured it had flown out as I was asleep. I was in my room most of today, and there were no signs of it being in there. Until suddenly it started flying around again, I opened my window again and left the room as I had to go out for a bit.

I have no idea if it's still in my room, as it may be hiding somewhere? I know they're good at getting into small places. I searched my room in the morning, went through my coats, looked under the bed, all corners and couldnt find him. But he was clearly still in my room as he came back. So Im not sure if it's once again somewhere in my room. Is there anyway to lure bats, or something I can do that would make it move? 

I dont really want a bat to be living in my room haha."

"Attention all Askmen users


Today I visited what could only be described as a salt mine. 

https://i.imgur.com/ohIRPqm.jpg

As you can see salt literally grows there. This is a place just outside of Krakow in Poland, the mine is over 360m deep, that's over 1000ft for the Americans. 

The beauty with salt is that is preserves everything. This wood https://i.imgur.com/VJYI1zm.jpg has been there for hundreds of years since they first found the salt deposits. 

This mine has been visited by lots of famous polish and German people (from what I could tell), one of them is depicted in this sculpture https://i.imgur.com/uJnSgas.jpg 

Note that the sculpture is made from salt. Impure salt, but still salt. The whole mine has lots of sculptures made from salt and all the walkways are carved through the salt. 

The story goes that a princess(or queen, I don't remember) from Hungary came to Poland and was engaged to someone. She threw her engagement ring down a shaft and a few years later it was found in the first big salt deposit. Later a prince or something from Poland wanted to marry her, I stopped following before they point, but this is obviously how it happened. 

https://i.imgur.com/QWRySRM.jpg

These sculptures are too carved in salt. 

When water gets into the rocks, salt forms, as you can see from here: 

https://i.imgur.com/ZWQbluk.jpg

Fresh salt being produced. 

Also this mine has been active for well over 500 years. The first few levels, you can see where the pick axes and whatnot have chistled away at the rocks to get the salt. Fun fact  this mine produced 25% of Poland's state income, since salt cost the same amount as gold (according to the polish man who gave the tou), the miners got paid extra salt, 30kg a year, which is a tradition that continues today. Although now it's just a token as salt costs next to nothing.

Water was always a big problem. It would lead to sinkholes forming on the surface. Water pumps were made to take the water away

https://i.imgur.com/ztdezsm.jpg

Salt miners are a very religious bunch, and in the mine there are 40 churches. One of them being this big gorgeous chapel 

https://i.imgur.com/7Yz2bv9.jpg

This was built by 3 men. Two of them were brothers. You can get married here if you want too, but it will cost you. 

https://i.imgur.com/1Bo2FaW.jpg

https://i.imgur.com/D1WnBn6.jpg

https://i.imgur.com/0Yl2ht3.jpg

There are lots of depictions of religious moments. Like the nativity and the lady supper, all carved into the salt. 

https://i.imgur.com/0csP4Le.jpg

In some chambers they have allowed water to pool, making salt water, more salty than the red sea, a person would not be able to drown in the water, but they would be eaten by the salt monsters that lurk beneath. 

All in all the salt mine was a good experience. However, the sheer mass of salt that is contained there pales in comparison to the amount of salt that you, the users of askmen seem to produce. 

I hope that this has been informative and you enjoy the salt."

"What can a woman do to make you feel more attractive?


I’ve been seeing a guy for over a year now. He’s 42, I’m 29, and I think it makes him feel insecure at times. I know he has self esteem issues and I call him handsome, sexy, etc. often to remind him. We have an incredible sex life (although he suffers from occasional ED) and we mix things up to accommodate, and I never draw attention to it. He’s also on the short side (but still taller than me) and it bothers him. What can I do to make him feel genuinely attractive and boost his confidence? He’s going through a lot right now and I want him to know for certain that he’s by far the hottest piece of ass I’ve ever seen. I feel like the emotional side of things is covered."

"Mod Post: Reminder to Report Content You Think Doesn't Belong Here


Sup shitlords,

So depending on what dark corners of the internet you frequent, you may be aware that a certain group of subs got hit with the quarantine today (trp, braincels, a bunch of other fun places) and these subs like to make their way here to tell us all what a bunch of walloping normies we are for trying to talk to women and to make fun of us for not having the common decency to be as miserable as they are.  The mod team's opinion of this is good riddance to all of them, maybe now they'll have the private community they always wanted until the admins decide to give them the inevitable axe.

At any rate, it's not unheard of for a group of these wandering salt miners to make their way to our fair (lol) sub whenever their most recent hidey-hole gets the proverbial admin nuke.  They bring with them not just inexorable amounts of cringe but also lots of salt and general hatred that doesn't really fit with the tone of this sub.  Which for those of you playing the home game is **lighthearted and fun**.  It's reddit, if you're taking it too seriously you have a problem.

Y'all have been pretty good at reporting stuff that you think doesn't belong here, and we'd just like to take the opportunity to thank you for your help and your continued assistance during this time of expected saltiness.  

Here's a quick primer on what the report button should be used for:

* Reporting comments/posts that are break the rules

* Reporting comments/posts that are excessively malicious towards a person/group of people (which happen to break the rules so I figured I should call it out)

Here's what the report button should NOT be used for:

* THIS MEAN PERSON ON THE INTERNET DISAGREED WITH ME MODS MODS MODS

* I personally think this post is stupid so I don't want it to show up on my askmen feed anymore

I will now take all feedback but be aware that my default answer will be [this](https://imgur.com/wa38sLH)

Thanks and have a great day!"
