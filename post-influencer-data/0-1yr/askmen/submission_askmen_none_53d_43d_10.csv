"What’s the weirdest sexual tension you’ve had?


I had a constant hard on for my humanities professor in college. She was in incredible shape for a 50 something year old woman. She just had this radiating sexual energy and the way she dressed didn’t help. She didn’t dress inappropriately, but figure flattering. I did some additional group study sessions in her office before exams. It was usually a group of about 5-8 of us. I was often the last to leave, usually engaging her in conversation. The air was static and I felt like the feeling was mutual but never acted on it. I often wonder what if."

"Guys who are with a woman who comes from a wealthier background, how has it impacted your relationship?


I come from a single mother situation, and usually didn't have that much money for things other than essentials when I was growing up. I will never be able to rely on my parents for financial support. 

My girlfriend on the other hand, comes from a family (parents not seperated) with plenty of money. Not rich rich, but everything she and her siblings needed or wanted, they got. Many vacations a year, eating out, big house, several cars, and as much funding for college as she needs. 

There are times that I feel like she doesn't fully understand what its like to be deprived of certain things or that she takes them for granted. 

My question is that how has this impacted your relationships? I'm especially curious about how it has effected parenting."
"Guys, when did you realise that the time has come to propose?


I've been thinking about this for some time. I'm (22M) in a relationship with an amazing woman (21F) for almost a year now, living together for a couple of months. The honeymoon phase still hasn't ended and I really doubt it ever will. We both were in serious relationships before and, talking about myself, I usually lost the spark pretty quickly (like 6 months or something) and both of my previous relationships didn't last for more than two years. And now, jeez, I feel so great, literally everything is amazing - life together, food, spending our free time together, financial stuff, careers, life-work balance, not being co-dependant, bedroom life is on fire and is improving all the time... I could go on for years.

The part of our relationship that makes me really happy is our values and views. We support each other all the time, we want the same things in life (like having children in a few years, keeping a close relationship with our family, and, you know, being kinda boring - not the partying young adults, not having a direction in life, as many around us are). I feel so loved, safe and supported - I haven't EVER felt this way in my life. We both had our crazy years, we both experienced a lot before meeting each other, we both did stupid and painful mistakes in our lives and it seems like we individually got everything figured out, we got a grip on everything. I remember myself feeling anxious about relationships in early 20s since every girl I met was, imho, immature and didn't know what they wanted from their lives. And she does, she knows it very well. Thanks to my encouragement and support she managed to make a huge turn in her career, dropping out of law school to seek her dream of becoming a teacher... I wish I've had a teacher like her!

It's really funny how things went fast... I remember the first months of our relationship when she said she doesn't want to rush anything at all, but life happened and she had to find a new place to live so we moved in together. She told me before that she doesn't want to be engaged or married soon. Now she sometimes asks me when I'm going to propose lol.

Everyone around us see us as one of the most serious and most loving couples. My mates already tell me ""You are next"" after one of them proposed to their long-time gf. My parents and siblings ADORE her, I am pretty sure hers like me as well.

So here comes the question - how did you feel it that it was time to ""bend the knee to your queen""? What were the things you considered? What made you sure?

I am seriously considering doing this in the upcoming year. But I am the type of person that is really careful about actions and decisions. I measure 99 times and only after that - I cut (that's a folk saying in my country, although it says measure 9 times before cutting). I know how important it is to her, it's crucial to me as well, but I'm still having thoughts about rushing things too much.

I am sure she is The One but I don't want to make a mistake of rushing in too fast. 

Please, feel free to be blunt. I value truth the most. I'd be really happy if you shared your success (or failure) stories!"
"What are some lowkey ways that you're a bro?


When my roommate has his girlfriend over they don't have sex when I'm in the house.  I don't know why - maybe they're self conscious or maybe they're just polite.  So whenever she's over I'll make time in the evening to walk to a nearby coffee shop and get myself some food.  My door is usually closed so he never realizes I'm gone unless I text him.  So I'll say something like ""gone out.  Be back in half an hour"".  So then they're free to have all the loud weird sex they want without restraint (or maybe with them, who knows).

It's not something we've ever discussed, and it's not a favour he asked me for.  I just do it, because bros."
"Why is there an obsession among girls with travelling?


TL;DR: Women in their 20s are increasingly obsessed with travel to exotic locales, and expect their potential partners to prefer the same. This is despite the fact that it is an expensive luxury few can afford, it doesn't necessarily confer any special knowledge of the world, and doesn't substitute for an interesting personality. 



I'm 29 years old. I live in a small-sized city on the east coast and I spend probably too much of my free time on apps like Bumble and Hinge finding girls to date.


Increasingly, I've noticed that girls profiles feature multiple photos of themselves in some exotic locale such as Japan, Italy, France, or China. Literally the last 3 profiles in a row have had every single photo be from a different travel destination (which motivated me to write this post). 


Don't get me wrong, I love to travel. I think travelling to foreign countries makes for great memories. I think it's safe to say that the majority of people enjoy taking a vacation somewhere besides where you normally live, and whether that vacation consists of relaxing on the beach, or exploring nature or museums, is entirely personal preference and worthwhile. And I have travelled quite a bit around the U.S. and Canada, but usually for no more than a week at a time.


I just had a date last night where this girl was obsessed with travelling — she knew exactly where she wanted to go next and was raving about her last trip. I told her about the cities I've been to around N.A. but I could feel the dissapointment when I told her that I haven't travelled abroad very much. I heard the words ""missing out"".

This wasn't the first time I've seen this attitude expressed on a date before. I'm familiar with the idea that economic disparity between couples can be a barrier to a successful relationship (i.e. when the man makes significantly more money than the woman). But I'm starting to feel like there's now a ""vacation"" barrier...where a girl expects her potential partner to have a catalog of world travel destinations they've been to.


This kind of mentality frustrates me for a few reasons. First off is the money thing. I'm a graduate student, and while I'm planning on finishing in the next year and getting into a high-paying career I don't have the money to throw down what I imagine is $2-3K on these trips to Europe and Asia. A lot of these girls travel with their family which is cool but my parents are older and not the type to go overseas on these kinds of trips.


Second, I reject this argument that one cannot ""understand"" the world or experience other cultures outside of travelling to these countries. There's a large number of immigrants from these countries right here at home and with a bit of effort you can talk to them and learn about their cultures, not to mention the large ethnic food presence to experience the cuisine. I enjoy reading and keeping myself knowledgeable about the world, whether it's articles in National Geographic or The Economist. I don't think travelling to these countries, especially when you don't speak the language, offers you any special kind of insight into the going-ons of that country or its cultural traditions. 


Third, this is often repeated on this subreddit, but travelling to foreign countries does not constitute a personality. Travelling is something most people enjoy as I said above. I'm afraid that girls (and guys too) are using travel as a means to show off material wealth, and to generate interesting stories and instagramable photos. While helpful at attracting interest in the opposite sex, none of these things sufficiently make up for incompatibility in personality.


I was hoping this post would generate a productive discussion of why this attitude towards travel is becoming increasingly common, and perhaps what you can say on a date to defend oneself when it comes to lack of travel without coming across as cheap or unadventurous."

"What are your best tips for girls who struggle to connect with men both romantically and in a friendship sense?


Where ever i go it just feels like i’ve never been able to connect to guys. I’ve always had male acquaintances and friends of friends but i don’t think i’ve ever had a male friend. I used to think maybe i just was a shitty person but i seem to get along well with girls just not guys.

Romantically i’m pretty much just invisible. I dont really get approached by guys on nights out and when i do the approaching i just feel so creepy because they always seem a little hostile. The fact that i struggle to even make male friends makes it hard to romantically connect in college, daily life etc. too."

"Men of reddit, how do you live a good life without dating?


I'm having trouble with, what I think is, self-actualizing. My whole life (33) has been  driven by a background need to date. Get a good education... to look more appealing to women. Get a good job.... to have money to date. Lose weight... to look attractive to women. (It bears mentioning that this has all been unsuccessful, I've only had one long term girlfriend once in my life.)

That being said, up until relatively recently, most of those goals have been relatively automatic. High school led to college, college led to more college, more college led to even more college (seriously i have like ten years of college edu) and that led to a decent job. I was just going with the flow. Lately I've been working and.... that's it. I don't feel particularly fulfilled at my job but it's good money, relatively easy and let's me travel. 

But back to the main point: I don't know how to live a good life without dating. It taints every action i perform.  I've been traveling around to a lot of cool places lately, but while walking though the beautiful streets of Kansas City, St. Louis, Las Vegas.... all i can think about is how much i wish i had a gal with me. 

I've been trying so hard lately to figure out my own goals, to live my life well regardless of relationship status, but i just don't know what i want to do. My life is pretty much just ""play video games, watch anime."" Im not driven by what a lot of people are: get wealthy, climb mountains, junk like that. But it's seriously been nearly a year since I've come to this conclusion to try to figure what i want to do with my life and I've got nothing! 

I've seen a therapist who encouraged me to do travelling with my job. We didn't make much other progress though. I just need some different kind of help do I'm coming to you guys. Thanks for listening."

"Men of reddit, I’m 25 and have never had a boyfriend. What can I do so that the next 5 years of my dating life don’t end up the same as the past 5 years?


Hello,

I just turned 25 last week and have been reflecting on my abysmal dating history. I’m beginning to become incredibly worried that I will continue on this trajectory for the next 5 years.

High School was a dud for me, guys openly expressed they found me unattractive and I even had a guy tell me “you’d be lucky if you ever found anyone to date you”. As you can imagine, this greatly impacted my self-esteem. 

College was a dud for me too. My first 2 years I never put myself out there. I was a premed and a college athlete so I never had time to socialize and spent most of my free time in my dorm. My last two years of college were slightly better. I went on one date with a guy but he had just gotten out of a relationship so that led nowhere.

I’m now going on 3 years out of college and have been relying solely on online dating because guys don’t approach me IRL. I hate online dating with a passion. It’s exhausting and so superficial— plus most of the people I’m attracted to IRL I would not immediately find them attractive if I saw them on an app. I’ve gone on about 20 dates, about half of them I wasn’t interested, a quarter of them weren’t interested in me, and another quarter we mutually didn’t purse anything .


I just feel so discouraged— I don’t know why it’s so hard for me. My response rate on bumble is an abysmal 20%... guys just aren’t attracted to me or they just view me as being kind of “meh”.

 I wonder if my height (6ft) and the fact that I’m black have anything to do with it. I don’t want my lack of experience to be viewed as a red flag and hinder me even more!  

I have hobbies, love my job, and have a healthy social life— but dating has always evaded me. What can I do differently?"
