"I am a protestor for road safety in Bangladesh. My friend is missing for protesting with me. AMA.


Hi.   For those of you that aren't following what's happening in Bangladesh   here is a tl;dr: High school and college students aged between 11 to 21   were protesting peacefully for safe roads. In response, goons  appointed  by the ruling party in Bangladesh attacked them. Yesterday 4  kids were  killed, 4 young girls were raped and many young girls were  abducted.  Today the goverment gorilla are systematically isolating  private  universities because after yesterday university students were  outraged  about the attacks and the goons were siegeing and attacking  the  universities armed with guns and machetes. Local media are silenced  by  the goverment and a photographer and activist named Shahidul Alam  dared  to speak about the situation to the international media  afterwhich he  was abducted from his home and now sent to remand and  currently being  tortured. Mobile internet speed is reduced to unusable  speed.

Amidst all of this, I just found  out one of my closest friends from  my university is missing. People are  saying the pro goverment goons  captured him and was beating him when  they escaped. I feel helpless now.  The friend's mother is contacting me  I have no answer for her.

I live the  opposite side of the globe but i shared posts from reddit  in my  facebook when it didn't concern me. After Paris attack i too used  the  hashtag #PrayForParis and used the french flag filter. Now we need  your  help guys.

Ask me anything to inquire  about the current situation here. Sorry in advance for any grammatical mistakes."

"My mom died today in the same incurable disease (Huntingtons disease) that just forced my sister to retire from working and I myself got diagnosed with. AMA


My mom died just a few hours ago from Huntingtons disease. She have been so sick that she have been in care centre for over 10years.  

My sister have had symptoms for about 10years, but they became so severe, especially the impaired speech so she had to retire from work now in December.

I myself (33) got the diagnosis in September so almost a year ago. I don't have noticeable symptoms yet. I have told my family and friends and try to be open about it to them. 

Huntingtons disease is a genetic condition that makes your body produce a mutated version of  a protein which physically hurts the brain and therefore gives both mental and physical symptoms. Depending on where the brain is affected it gives different problems, but the most common are reduced motivation, uncontrolled movements, dementia, bad balance and reduced speech. Death occurres after 10-20 years after the first symptoms.  

I write this post to discuss my feelings anonymously in an hope that it will help me overcome the sadness.

Fuck Huntingtons "
"When my partner of 13 years committed suicide, I discovered that he was leading a double life. AMA


Answered a thread on Ask earlier and have had a lot of questions so thought i'd do this. 

2 hours before my partner hung himself, I discovered that he'd been lying to me for our whole relationship. The day after his death, I found out that he'd been living a complete double life. He had been married with family for almost 30 years and also with myself and our daughter for 13 years. Neither family knew or suspected anything."

"Grew up in a cult, severe sex and physical abuse, coma, 25+ broken bones, and ended up with a pistol in my mouth 7 years ago. I made the choice to keep going and now life is good again. I survived it all. AMA


Please no shitty comments, I’ve been harmed enough. The TBI took away my impulse control so I’m very easily triggered. I feel every emotion at the highest level all the time. 
I escaped the Jehovah’s Witnesses cult at 20(people who say it’s not a cult just don’t know) physically and sexually abused while inside that horrible organization, then I was in a car accident that resulted in a month long coma and shattered my neck and back, broke all my left ribs which went into my lung, and crushed my left arm/shoulder/clavicle that doctors reconstructed with titanium, and of course the TBI. Severe brain damage. So many surgeries and scars and scar tissue. It was so bad. Something happened with the nitrogen in my blood and I blew up to three times my size. I woke from the coma feeling like I had been beaten for a million years. The drunk piece of garbage responsible for the accident got three more DUIs after and totaled another car and went to prison. Florida is a no-fault state so no big payday for me. I have no idea how we could have payed for everything if my wife wasn’t a Marine at the time. She was stationed in Okinawa when it happened, she flew 20 hours back to the States not knowing if I was alive or dead or a vegetable. I spent my twenties rehabilitating, inpatient and out. Since I left the cult my parents disowned me so I had to heal without them. I stood on the edge with a gun in my mouth a few years ago. I just didn’t want to live anymore. I can still close my eyes and go right back to that moment where I woke from the coma... coming back online not the same. The sheer terror of ICU psychosis, the fear and confusion of not coming back the same, not coming back as me... I’ve never been the same. 
Even at level ten pain for days still, even experiencing pain so horrible I lived on the edge of shock for a long time, even had to be put back in a chemically induced coma the first time I woke... it’s still worth it. Life is worth it. Now I help veterans through my soon to be 501c3. Life is so beautiful even in constant pain. Anyone of you who is feeling suicidal, please keep going. You can get through anything life throws at you if you are still breathing. I have love for you all just based on the fact that you’re a part of my human family. Take good care of yourselves. -aaron "
