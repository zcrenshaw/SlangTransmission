"How much do men even notice a woman's personality in the beginning?


Be brutally honest: Within the first two months of meeting a woman, do men even notice her personality, or do they ""fall"" for her based on looks alone? When - if ever - does personality start to matter to most men? It seems like a lot of guys hardly notice anything other than looks at first. Then, like two years later, I'll hear them complain that they don't have enough in common with their girlfriend. I'm like, *Wait - you're just now figuring this out?*

If looks are all that matter to guys at first, then why do so many attractive women say they are rarely approached or asked out, while their more ordinary-looking friends / acquaintances are? (I've heard this a lot). 

I have my theory, but I wanted a guy's perspective. Thanks!"

"Men of Reddit, why don't you pee sitting down?


As a lad living at home I never wondered about it. Probably because I was not doing the cleabing part at our house hold. When I moved out, my room mate suggested it. Said it was more hygenic and it stuck to me after all these years.

...the difference is big btw."

"As an adult how do you rebuild your social life?


I am 22 years old and currently I am finishing up trade school this semester. The only people I speak to on a weekly basis are my parents and my sibling. Occasionally I will hear from one of my cousins but that is a once every few months situation. Beyond that I have no social life.         
      
I do not work in my field yet but I do work in a restraunt. Everyone in the place does stuff outside of work, has group chats and inside jokes. I have worked there longer than some of these people and yet I've never been invited to any of this.        
      
At school there is a group of about 20 guys and they all have the same situation. They have group chats, a class Snapchat, they go out together after class or on the weekends. I've never been included in any of this there either.     
     
I talk to people, I try to open up and be myself and get to know them in hopes of making a friend. But I'm not sure where I am going wrong. I never had this issue before graduating from highschool. I made new friends often, talked to girls, had a close group of friends, and was invited to stuff often. Those people went off to college, moved out of state, or just stopped talking to me all together.     
     
Currently I do not have much time to pursue hobbies because between school and work I do 60-70 hours in class / at work a week. But as I get closer to graduating I've opened my schedule up to enjoy my life again and I have no one to enjoy it with. I see all these friendships blossom around me with people I talk to but never with me and I'm not quite sure why.      
      
I find myself slipping into a deep rut. I have no friends, since my last relationship (3 years) ended I have met no one, my family is there but only when their lives stop do I see them. If not for work and school I would go days to weeks without having a conversation with anyone besides family. It is starting to get to the point where I no longer want to bother with communicating with my coworkers and classmates because I have convinced myself they must not like me and I can tell my body language is starting to show my negative feelings outwardly. I find myself hearing people talk about plans and see my former friends hanging out together on social media and I end up at home alone in a slump because I wish I could do stuff with anyone while others are out enjoying life as I sit in my bed.       
       
But I don't want to just pity myself and how my life is. At one point I was always making new friends, meeting and taking girls out, I had a happy social life and felt fulfilled and while I feel like I am very unlikable these days I know that can't be entirely true.      
     
How do I build a social life and make friends? What are some common things someone could unconsciously do that pushes people away from them?      
     
How did you as an adult make new friends? How did you repair old friendships?

"Before she departs from my college, and my life, i confessed to the French exchange student that i love her. Men, what's your history of impossible loves and brief romances with foreigners?


 So, since the beginning of the semester, i got a crush on a French girl. I was mesmerized, stunned by her beauty and personality. Couldn't stop daydreaming about her. I tried all semester to go out with her, to get to meet her better. All efforts prove to be futile.

Today, last days of the semester, I came to her and asked her one last time. After she told me she couldn't because her tight schedule.

Before she depart away, I ended up confessing to that I love her, told her a speech about how amazing she was and I gifted her a book.

"Why pursue a girl only to say you’re overwhelmed now and want to stay friends…?


TLDR: coworker pursued me and wanted to be in a relationship. He would bring up relationship stuff and ask what I saw for us. Then he says he is too overwhelmed with life rn and says to just be friends. I say I can’t do that and he cries. Why would he talk about being with me just to do that?

I (20f) have been seeing a coworker(24m) for about a month. He told me he liked me on Halloween and had liked me for a few weeks and I was shocked to hear that. I was silent and then when prompted told him I liked him too(I’m a little shy). He knows that he is the first guy I’ve ever been with and that I’ve been sexually abused before and said he understands and wanted to meet my needs and eventually be in a relationship when ready. We went out on dates and he actively pursued me and we texted constantly. He would always initiate talks about what we were gonna be and future stuff. He said he told his friends and family about me and even showed pics to his family and I met his friends (He met mine later as well). He’s been going through some life things and I know his first and only girlfriend cheated on him. When we met he was still living with her and told me that when he met me he realized he needed to move out if he ever wanted a real relationship with someone(meaning me). But now he said he felt like a switch went off inside him and felt we just needed to be friends. That this (what he’s feeling emotionally overwhelmed) is the same reason him and his ex had trouble. He said that he still thinks I’m beautiful and is a great girl, but he is not ready for a relationship rn like he thought he was and we never know what the future holds. He showed me phone to show that he’s not talking to other girls. He is still moving out of his ex’s house, so I don’t think she’s the problem, but I’m wondering what made him make a 180. When he told me he just wanted to be friends I told him I didn’t think it was possible and we couldn’t be friends. He cried when I said that and said he understands but it makes him sad bc goodbyes are hard. I just don’t get him…
Also: should I stay his friend?"
"How long should a ""break"" last?


Me and this guy I like had a huge fight, I was in the wrong and hurt him extremely, we've already been having fights for the past while.

He ended up saying he needs a break from this, I don't know what to make of it, I think he needs some time off to see if he still wants to pursue this after what happened? I'm not sure what to expect here, full no-contact? how long would be too long to wait? 

I'm driving myself crazy thinking about it and would appreciate some insight from men on what they define or need a break for."

"How do you deal with friend who turned sour?


So there is this person ive known for about half a year now. We are both dudes in our early twenties

Our friendship got off quite well. One thing I noticed after a while were his mood changes. On some days, hed be in a good mood and would be sociable. But on some days hed be in a bad mood and Id get short replies (as if enough to get me to be quiet). I understand that not everyday will be a good day.

Back in November, I noticed his bad days were becoming increasingly frequent. It felt like I could not talk to him without seemingly annoying him. Sometimes he would even give me one word replies both up front and through text

The other day i asked him a question and he sort of snapped. I apologized. Later that day I texted saying i shouldve gotten an apology too and since (based on his behaviour lately) it seems like he doesnt want to talk to me, i wont be talking to him again. I got no response.

I then realized that everyone made mistakes and i shouldnt cast someone out because of a mistake. So i sent another text a week later saying I shouldve given him a chance and i shouldnt have said what i said last week. I even apologized for it. Its been three days and still no response. I also havent seen him since as i havent been going to the place we frequent.

Funny thing is we havent blocked each other anywhere

Im just a bit upset at how he isnt so bothered about losing me. I’ve been quite nice (disproportionately nice you might say). I help him out with small things here and there, even paid for his beer twice. Hes been nice too (but not as much as i have) until this november he went cold out of nowhere. 

Has anyone else ever experienced this? I feel like maybe i was too nice or too overfriendly for his liking. I also dont think ive said anything to offend him

Tl;dr friend turned cold, not sure what to feel"

"My (21) boyfriend (24) is ignoring me? What to make of this?


Hello,  I'm just looking for some insight into his behaviour, since he won't talk to me. 

My boyfriend has been ignoring me for the last two weeks.

We don't live together (in fact, he lives in a different city but commuting back and forth is no problem here) and have been in an exclusive relationship for the past three months. Everything seemed to be going well: we would regularly see each other and talk over the phone or text, whether it was to check on each other, say hello, highlight interesting news, share funny pictures or videos or to make plans. We complement each other very well; we have a lot of chemistry, share similar values and interests but we are also different enough that it's not like we are dating ourselves. It's effortless with him. He recently said ""I love you"" and I said it back.

He was recently offered a job in a different country (country X) and he asked me how I felt about it. I told him that I was not pleased by the idea of him moving country because we had just started dating, but was happy for him. He reassured me that he wouldn't take the job as he didn't want to move. Fast forward to last week, I am trying to arrange something for us to do and ask him when he'll be coming back to my city. He doesn't respond (this is unusual because he is usually very responsive), worried I try calling him but the phone just rings. The next day he calls saying he's actually in country X and doesn't know when he'll be back. I am obviously taken aback by this - he never mentioned travelling to this country when I spoke to him throughout the week or when I saw him on the weekend before - and have no idea what to say to him; he doesn't volunteer anymore information but I suspected it was because of the job. I don't instigate any communication between us after this because I needed a moment to let it sink in, I was deeply hurt and confused by his behaviour, and plus, I didn't want to come across as accusatory and demanding but he didn't try to communicate at all and just left it at that.

I couldn't handle the silence anymore and I ended up reaching out to him, via text, 4 days later, just to make sure he was okay and to see if I could get more information out of him. He said it was because he was conflicted and trying to figure out what to do - he wants to take the job, but he also wants to be with me and is not sure if I would want a long (er) distance relationship. Soon after receiving this text, I try to call him but the phone just goes unanswered, I text him urging him to call me and telling him that I want him to do what is best for him and that I love him. Again, I'm met with silence.

He is ignoring me and I am very hurt. I want to talk to him and I'm willing to go see him, but he won't answer my calls or respond to my texts. I don't think I can carry on like this ( I don't want to) but I love him.

Is he getting ready to break up with me? How can you explain this behaviour?

**TL;DR:** BF travelled to a different country without telling me and is now refusing to talk to me, but insists he wants to be with me."
