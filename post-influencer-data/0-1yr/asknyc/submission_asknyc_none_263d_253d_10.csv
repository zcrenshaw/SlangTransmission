"Wage works metro card says see agent. I have no agent at my local stops. Am I SOL?


I swiped my metro card and it didn’t work. I had an extra card that had one way fare so I used it and tried my wage works again and got the “see agent” message. Is there any way to resolve this easily when my stations have no agents? Other than waiting to get a new card and paying for paid fare when I already paid for unlimited.

Thanks"

"What to do on New Years Day?


Planning on meeting up with a friend in the afternoon on New Years Day. Any suggestions on what to do? I was thinking of brunch somewhere around soho/the village. Any recommendations for brunch places that will be open on the 1st? or any other events going on. I was kinda thinking about the polar plunge (just to watch - not partake) but I think it might be too early for us"
"Quick question about how to dress in winter


Sorry if this is a stupid question but would you look out of place in a bar in a heavy jacket in places where there's no coat check?

I'm visiting in two weeks and I want to explore and visit a few bars and restaurants. Would you look like an asshole walking into a bar in a big coat?

I only ask because where I'm from, it's standard practice to go at night out midwinter and be cold rather than wear a big coat but I've been to Poland where they'd have hooks etc to hang your big heavy coat up at the door."
