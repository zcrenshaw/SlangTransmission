"What is the number one thing you try to ignore about the city?


Obviously homelessness has to be up there, but I only recently thought about how disgusting metrocards must be since everyone's always touching and dropping them and no matter who you are we all slide them through the same sensor labia thing so something must be rubbing off."
"Who to go to for really bad NYCHA conditions? Pictures included


Peeling lead paint is okay, I'm painting it. The people I stay with right now literally gave up months ago but my health is noticeably dropping, I can't shower without coughing and getting dizzy. I have very poor health as it is.

NYCHA tore out a broken sink and just... Left it like this. They never came back for it. They won't acknowledge it.

"Upstairs neighbors


Guys, I can't take it. Since the beginning of June, there's been a ton of little feet running back and forth all day long upstairs. I looked on Streeteasy and indeed that's when new neighbors moved in. It's also an old pre-war building so there's step down living rooms and the kids love to jump off the stairs. This morning it was at 6 am. I love kids. I am LITERALLY A PEDIATRICIAN. But this is too much. I don't have my own children but I get that they are active. But should we all suffer? What's the least obnoxious way to ask them to please keep it down?"
"I found a bed bug on my backpack. Time to die.


Back in Baltimore my mom and my sister both had them and it sucked for them. I’m going to call the super and the landlord. We have a memory foam mattress and we haven’t had any bites and we haven’t seen anything on the bed, so I’m thinking I brought it in from outside since I take the train with my backpack daily.

My bag was against the wall, so I have no idea if my neighbors have them and they’re fleeing over here. We have been dealing with cockroaches coming from the neighboring apartments as well.

I want to (quietly) scream because I just moved here in May."
"Whats the white collar life like?


I have a blue collar family. My dads an electrician and my mom works at the unions headquarters dealing with electricians every day. Ive gotten numerous jobs associated with the union working at the headquarters and even on site with electricians. My mom has worked at the unions headquarters since i was a baby, im 21 now (male), and she knows a ton of people- which has been helpful to getting those jobs i mentioned before. Many of these people have watched me grow up and almost every one at the headquarters probably knows me as ""my mothers"" son. I actually just applied to the apprenticeship a month ago, ill prob get a response a few years from now.

One of the jobs i did called ""college helper"" gave me the chance to work on these huge jobs sites with these electricians. I get to hang out with these hilarious guys talk about a bunch of bullshit and fuck around with each other. There are barely any women on the job unlike office jobs. I wear construction clothes and boots and by the end of the day, i get filthy and tired. I enjoy the work i get to do with them, but i cant help but notice during lunch, break and after work- all these white collar workers. I was trying to explain how ive been surrounded by a blue collar environment pretty much my entire life so its really hard to fathom a white collar life style. 

I see all these guys in fancy suits and i cant help but imagine that these guys might be making a ton of money or are working in some competitive bustling office. But what do i know, literally nothing. Some of the electricians ive talked to believe they actually make more than most of these guys. But still, working in a competitive office sounds like fun. Ive actually been considering taking up a business major/minor alongside my computer science major because my curiosity has peaked. Please someone tell me all about white collar and office culture."
