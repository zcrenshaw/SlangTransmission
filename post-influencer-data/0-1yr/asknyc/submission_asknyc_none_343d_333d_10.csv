"Anywhere to make copies at this hour/close to it?


Spectacularly, my printer is non functional in the moment I need to print. No access to my office today until after I need copies. Big box stores with print shops aren't open until after. In this moment I miss the weird old 24/7 internet cafes of yore. Anyway I need to be near Jay Street with shit at 10am. It's mostly a preference (a job or a life or even a class isn't on the line or anything) but it's also something I just don't know, where to get a goddamn bw print of a text pdf on a piece of regular paper anymore that isn't at home or a big box.

"What neighborhoods of NYC have the most similar feel to this one in Toronto?


[Art/Music/Head shops, graffiti being embraced, and a hipster sort of vibe]

"What parking places do you all recommend near Pier 17?


Driving into the city for a concert next Saturday. Where can I park within a few blocks of Pier 17 that isn't shady (or at the very least is the least shady)? Pier 17 recommends LAZ parking?"
