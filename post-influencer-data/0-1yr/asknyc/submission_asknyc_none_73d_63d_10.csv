Just kidding. Happy Fourth you fucking fucks."
"Depressed humans of NYC: What do you do outside to integrate and feel a little more alive?


I've been shut in for so long now I can't even count. I've tried immersing myself in social meetups, even hosting a few, but after a while I felt the happiness from it didn't last long. I'm out of school &amp; work so I'm guessing working can definitely help. But I want to know what I can do for now that will just get me outside? I love this city, but I also kind of hate it. I dread the idea of being around so many people; especially young people my age range (early-mid 20s). I live in Manhattan so there's no avoiding it, but I want to get out somewhere peaceful or do something solo that is fun/mentally stimulating yet not stressful. I have no strong preferences, because quite frankly nothing seems fun to me atm. I want to try though. I'm sick of being in my room all day and exhausted."

"[Serious] What is it like to have grown up in NYC as a teenager?


Sooo a bit of context about me. 

I’m 15 and turning 16 this August. My family have told me that there is a very high chance I will be moving to Queens or Brooklyn sometime this year or early 2020. I will be entering my sophomore year of high school. 

So I just have question from people who grew up here.  What was it like being a teenager here? Granted I’m from Miami so not a small city at all, but we don’t have public transportation and things of that sort. And I needed a car/bike to get to many places. 

Are schools in NY gigantic? Will they allow me on the trains by myself or do I gotta be 18? I’ve visited here once before but I was with adults. Do most kids usually take the train to school? Did you like growing up here? 


Thank you to everybody in advance!"
"how common is it for social life to be centered on restaurants?


i have two distinct friendship circles where everything we do is based on meeting up for food at a restaurant (+ sometimes drinks, either while eating or afterwards, but food takes center stage). How common is this and is this typical? When you meet up with friends, is it most often at a restaurant?

curious since i've also started to meet more people and realized this probably isn't the case for every friendship group/culture, and may even be uncommon"
