"Curious Australian here, who maintains NYC and where do they live?


Okay I know that sounds ridiculous, but bear with me. 

I’ve never been to USA, or many countries for that matter outside Australia and NYC is one of those cities I’m sure everyone grows up seeing on TV, movies, documentaries and computer games. 

I’ve always had a weird obsession with NYC because it’s just such a cultural monster and so unlike anything I’ve ever experienced, coming from a tiny Australian city. 

I often use google maps just to scoot around and immerse myself in it. 

Okay so on to my questions, forgive me if I’m wrong here, but as far as I know Manhattan is  the busiest and wealthiest area. 

I’ve heard how hard it is for low income earners to survive. 

What I wonder is, if you look at a city as dense and populous as NYC, there’s always something that needs doing. Air con fix, plumbers, mechanics, electricians, mechanical maintenance. 

There would be millions of things every day needing maintenance or fixing in NYC

So where do these blue collar professions come from? 

Do they all literally live in outer suburbs and travel an hour or more to jobs every day? 

What about an electrician who has a job to fix a light in NYC, does he literally have to drive hours just to get to the job in that ridiculous traffic?

Or is there pockets of Manhattan and the like that still have blue collar affordability?

I’m sorry if this comes off incredibly odd, my mind often thinks of the weirdest curiosities."

"Why don't people use the smaller MetroCard machines


There's always HUGE lines in front of the big machines and nobody waiting for the smaller ones. They've always worked when I use them, they're functional. And there's never a line so I never wait. What gives? I'm not complaining but I really want to know why there's never a line of people in front of those machines"
