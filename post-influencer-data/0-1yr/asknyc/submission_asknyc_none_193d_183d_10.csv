"Single New Yorkers who can eat a loaf of bread before it expires


(Without freezing it)

What's your secret? Do you eat sandwiches for every meal?"
"Are New Yorkers aware of the disdain other Americans have for them?


Recently spent some time out in the south, especially around Tampa, Miami, and Atlanta and it seems for whatever reason, there seems to be negative attitude towards NYC. Whenever mentioning I'm from NYC, people always ask questions like ""How does living like a sardine/hipster/cog feel?"" and ""How can you stand that place?"".  There's also the comment sections of any Facebook or Youtube video about New York City from people who are proud they haven't been to or live in NYC. 

Are people in NYC generally aware of this? How do you folks feel about this? Why do you think is the case?

"
"Has anyone else subjected themselves to the dark purgatory that is the Mall of Manhattan?


Checked it out a few nights ago out of a morbid curiosity on a walk. Holy Hell. 

Honestly I'd recommend it as a case study in what looks to be bad lease deals. "
"How common is it to feel FOMO and just a constant pressure of needing to enjoy the city and do things?


I moved here a year ago and I noticed I am always feeling like I have to do something, go to a restaurant/ show / museum some kind of event to enjoy the city. Especially when it's nice out I feel even more pressure. 

Not sure what this means but does anyone have any insight about this or can relate?"
