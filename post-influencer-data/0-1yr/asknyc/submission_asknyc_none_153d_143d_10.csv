"Ultimate Cheap Eats in NYC Thread


You can eat way more than dollar slices and steal eat cheap.
We've done the work so you can stuff your face and still have enough to make rent at the end of the month.



#**For the Dirt Poor**

**The dollar slice.** The classic cheap eats on NYC. You'll find business men, to students, to crust punks  all snackin' on slices. [Here's a map of some one dollar joints](https://slice.seriouseats.com/2010/03/where-to-get-99-cent-slices-2-bros-dollar-pizza-in-nyc-with-map.html). After trying a bunch you will find your favourite spot. Your opinion is correct unless it's the 2 bros on St. Marks.

**Dollar dumplings.** Not really a dollar anymore (1.50 - 2 as of 2019) They're a bunch of places in Chinatown that offer low cost dumplings. A really common snack for after school kids and drunk adults.  Like the dollar slice, after eatting around you'll eventually find your own spot and fall in love. Here's a [article](https://untappedcities.com/2015/08/28/7-dollar-dumpling-spots-in-nyc-to-tide-you-over-until-prosperity-dumpling-reopens/?displayall=true) to get you started.

*Our Asian spot shout outs.*

- [Tacos Angelita](https://www.yelp.com/biz/tacos-angelita-new-york)
&gt;  It's a dad and son food cart on 55th and Lexington. It's right by my office and about a year ago when I was looking for a spot for lunch, I saw a big group of Mexican construction workers waiting in line. I knew that this spot must be legit. During lunch, 90% of the time the people coming here are Mexican construction workers and delivery guys.
&gt; 
&gt; $3 gets you a pretty good sized taco. 3 of them and I'm stuffed, and I'm a big dude. I personally like the al pastor and chorizo. Burritos are $7 and massive. They usually have random special dishes for lunch too for about $5. Usually some sort of stew, or meat and veggies. Once in a blue moon they have home made tamales for $2.
&gt; 
&gt; Basically, just a very authentic and cheap taco cart, easily overlooked. FYI, expect to wait about 15-20 minutes for your food as they cook everything fresh. /u/VBarkingFrog

#**For the Poor Poor**

- **Jerk Chicken Platter** (crazy serving of chicken, and two sides) at Tony's Pizzeria in Crown Heights, Brooklyn. - $11 and change, total Best Jerk Chicken in the city and you can quote me on that (have been to over 20-something jerk spots around brooklyn and upper manhattan). Ernie, tony's' owner, cooks the chicken in the pizza oven /u/juicyjuicyjuicyjuicy

 Peppa's on Flatbush and Clarkson /u/kickrox88


- **Woorijip**between 5th Ave &amp; Broadway on W 32nd Great korean food. Sold by the pound. Dinner usually costs around $5. I eat there a few times a week. /u/banffff


- **Go Go Curry** Katsu Curry for $7 /u/nobodysdiary

- Wo Hop

- [Lahore Deli](http://places.singleplatform.com/lahore-deli/menu?ref=google), hole in the wall on Crosby just south of Houston, should get a mention. /u/chengjih




- **Alligator Lounge and Crocodile Lounge** During happy hour. $3 for a cheap beer and a mini pizza. /u/maramos

#**For the Fake Poor**

- **Pio Pio** 

""A chain of Peruvian restaurants. Go as a party of four and get a single order of the Matador Combo ($36). You'll get: a quartered Peruvian-style rotisserie chicken, rice, beans, tostones (fried plantains), salchipapas (sausages and fries), and avocado salad. That's under $10 a person and it is a nice sit-down restaurant. If you guys are extra hungry, add an appetizer. Get sangria by the pitcher as well."" /u/WishNoah


- Paul's Da Burger Joint

- Corner Bistro

"How likely is it that I'm going to fall through those flimsy sidewalk basement doors?


I've developed a slightly irrational fear of putting all my weight onto those and it's creating slight difficulty walking around these days. Anyone ever hear of this happening?"
"Is anybody else sick of the complete trashy ass people in the chat section of the Citizen app?


For starters the chat is suppose to be for updates on the situation and for people to be able to help each other regarding the circumstances.  
  
I don't have a problem with someone making a little joke here and there in a socializing manner.  
  
BUT majority of the chats are filled with complete degenerate trash and racism. It's disgusting because it promotes violence as entertainment and furthermore lowers the bar in society when it comes to younger generations. I've also seen many people retaliate to this trash by using racism but that's also trash so please try not to do that folks.  
  
Can we come to a consensus to take the trash out? If the majority of the chat was good people out talking the trash with logic, the trash would eventually fade away because of there failure to think and respond. The only problem I see here is that the good people simply do not spend that much time on the app to even do that and it's the trash that are constantly circle jerking each other.  
  
So what is the consensus here? Do we just let a very useful app get beat down like this? Can Citizen developers do something that can help combat this problem if we showed them we actually have some kind of care?
  
Obviously it's not really a serious problem because it's just an app but this app will continue to grow and the trash will get worse and like I said, it lowers the bar in general even though it might not get to you it gets to others.  
  
There's no saying if the report button is even useful. Perhaps Citizen can expand on that and perm-mute users which would be effective since you must sync your number with the app.  
  
This is partially a rant because I've seen many people who are concerned about society and people who feel hurt because of a certain situation that's being mocked upon such as a missing teenage girl where it may show a photo and users will make fun of how the girl looks. Imagine being related to that girl and seeing the chatbox... it would be heartbreaking"
