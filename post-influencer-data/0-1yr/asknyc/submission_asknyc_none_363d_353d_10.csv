"Horrible subway station incident


Hey guys, I am trying to see if I can get a little guidance on how to approach this situation. This morning as I was waiting for the subway there was a guy who kept looking my direction. I didn't pay any mind to it as it's not uncommon in the city. He later came to sit on this box(utility?) I had my bags resting on. I originally paid no mind to it as he looked like a normal working class man, but then I noticed through the corner of my eye that he was making an up and down movement with his hand. Once I saw that it triggered me to look over only to be shocked to see this guy with his penis out and jacking off right next to me.

I was honestly in so much shock all I did was say, ""wtf wow"" grabbed my things and walked far away from him. I looked around and out of all the ppl there no one was looking. I looked back to try and snap a picture of him and he was gone. I was so shook up and the train was coming that I didn't go down to report it to the MTA assistant nor did I call the cops. It was my first day back to work after my maternity leave and I did not want to be late so I hopped on the train.

I'm currently at work just thinking of how violated I feel and how I should report this in hopes there was surveillance that caught this idiot. Considering how easily it was for him to do such a thing I assume this is not an isolated incident. I am currently beating myself up for not causing a scene and embarrassing him in front of everyone but all I could think of is ""this dude is insane, don't go there"".

Any one has any guidance on what is the best way to approach this? Call the cops? Email mta? Speak to the mta attendant when I go back home from work?

I know this is a common thing in NYC, however it does not make it ok."
"Where in NYC can I find swings accessible to adults?


Obviously I don’t mean sex swings, just regular playground swings but which are not on an actual playground, as I have no children and really don’t want to get a ticket. I just want to space out and feel some wind in my hair."
