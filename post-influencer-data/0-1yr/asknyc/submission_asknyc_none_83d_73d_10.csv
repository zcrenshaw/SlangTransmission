"What low cost city resources do people not really know about but should?


I’ve lived here for most of the past decade and through random circumstance  discovered two great city/community programs.

The first is the city parks and rec gym membership, which even at the steep cost of $150 a year ($25 if you’re 18-25, and FREE if you’re under 18) is amazing. There are classThe facilities aren’t the newest or cleanest but they’re completely functional and spread across the city. Summer pool access, affordable. Thank you Dept. of Parks and Rec. 

The second is the fresh food box program, where for $14 a week I get most of the produce I eat, sourced locally. I have a location particularly close to my home, so I understand why this might not be for everyone, but for the number of people I know who participate in CSAs, nobody seems to know about this one that comes it around half the price of others AND let’s you skip weeks.

So, NYC, what other things am I sleeping on?"
"What is the grossest street in NYC?


I feel like we all have that one street we know is disgusting and avoid. 

Mine is 34t-35th down 6th.  Its gotta be the worst smelling place in NYC. 

Its a terrible combination of Midtown, over head shed, crowded homeless encampment, empty store fronts, and all trash from the herald square area is placed there for pick up so the only time there isn't trash there is literally while there is a garbage truck picking it up."
"What are some “social rules” unique to NYC that people new to NYC should know.


For instance, when I lived in the Bay Area in CA, no one from the bay ever called San Francisco “San Fran”  or “Frisco” if you do that you’ll get made fun of and silently judged. Same goes for the train called “BART” you’d say “take BART” and never “take the BART”

What are some things I should know about NYC? I’ll be moving there for grad school and don’t want to get made fun of or annoy locals. The only things I know are to keep to the left when walking and to let people get off the subway train first. Are there other important things that aren’t just common sense that I should know about NYC?"
"What are your biggest pet peeves about New York?


Here's mine: when people stand in the doorway of the train and won't let you out because they're not paying attention, slow walkers, groups who take up the entire sidewalk, and when people talk on their phone while ordering food or coffee"
"Can landlord kick us out early so they can paint for the new tenant?


My lease ends July 31st, and I've paid rent until then. A new tenant is taking the place on August 1st. This is an apartment in Brooklyn.

Landlord wants to paint before the new tenant moves in, and has asked me to move out a few days early. I'm happy to do so, if they refund my rent for those days. They refuse to do so.

In addition, Landlord says if I DON'T move out early, they will charge me rent for the first couple of days in August, when they are repainting the apartment for the next tenant.

Are they allowed to do this? I'm having trouble Googling whether this is legal."
