"Intimate Japanese Restaurants


Im proposing to my girlfriend next month and want to take her to a small, nice Japanese restaurant. Im looking for a place with limited seating where the sushi chef makes you what he has as opposed to ordering. Not sure if thats a thing, but anything that feels really personal would be great. Any suggestions?"
"Experience at Brooklyn Steel?


I have GA tickets to a concert at Brooklyn Steel.  Never been there before and in fact barely ever have the time to get to concerts, so I'm a novice as I'm sure this post conveys, but what time should I get there if I don't really care about being close to the stage?  It says doors at 7 and show at 8.  Is it okay to show up at 8 (or even after 8?) or will I end up crammed in some back corner unable to move?  Just wondering if anyone has experience with Brooklyn Steel and might have some helpful insight.  Thanks in advance!"
