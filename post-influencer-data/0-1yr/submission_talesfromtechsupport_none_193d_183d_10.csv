"Board Member threatens to fire me


 This is part one of my ""story time"" on a blog I have. Figured I'd post it here.

So, a while back I had made a website for a company. It was a simple landing page for a project they had, a series of products. To give you some context, this wasn't a big firm but they had around 10-15 employees and overall dealing with them was quite nice, the owner who I primarily spoke with had a great sense of humour and paid me when due and never had a problem with the fees I took for maintaining the servers the landing page was on. I even had the chance to visit their office and talk to the three employees involved on this project so I could talk to them and get a good idea on their goals and wishes for the project. It took me a couple of hours, I think it was 10-15 overall to complete the landing page and we agreed that a monthly fee of 50 USD was appropriate for hosting and one hour of support(mostly small changes so I never tracked the time spent).

And here comes the troubles... Three months later I receive a phone call, lets call him Mr. Investor. It turns out that around 25% of the company had been sold to Mr. Investor and he had gotten a seat on the board(which originally was the owner and a employee). At this point I had no idea where the conversation and I was slightly annoyed he had called me 10PM so I did my best to be polite.After about three minutes of formalities he goes straight to the point, and tells me he wants a website made as soon as possible. Now by all means, I don't mind getting new jobs handed to me just like that. But as it turns out, he wanted it all done for free.(Names changed, Paul = Owner and David = employee)

&gt;\[Introductions and formalities\]  
Board Member: So I need you to make a new site and I need it ASAP.  
Me: Alright, that's no problem! If you could provide me with some more information I can provide you with a price and time estimate. Whats your ema{interrupted}  
  
&gt;  
&gt;Board Member: Nonono, what do you mean price estimate? My company already pays you!  
  
&gt;  
&gt;Me: Well, they pay me for maintaining the site and associated systems and for an hour of support per month such as minor changes.  
  
&gt;  
&gt;Board Member: NO, thats not the agreement! We pay to to develop don't we?  
  
&gt;  
&gt;Me: Well yes but anything that exceeds the one hour monthly of supports I charge the company for.\[at this point the board member is heavily breathing as he gets annoyed and probably mad\]  
  
&gt;  
&gt;Me: Besides I normally only get these requests from Paul or David who is working on this project. If you could email me what you need, I can provide you with the price estimate.   
  
&gt;  
&gt;\[Board member hangs up the call\]

  
Now I didn't want to loose this client as they had been my ideal client from beginning until now so I sent an email to Paul to explain what just had happened and to confirm whether this was company related. Before Paul got back to me, I received an email from Board Member. He essentially wanted a site similar to AirBnB and he told me in quite a rude way that if I didn't do this I would loose the company as a client and if I brought up the costs of this he would smear me towards all my clients(at the time not a lot so they all mattered).I forwarded the email to Paul and told him my frank opinion as a curtesy, that I believed Board Member was trying to leverage his stake in Pauls company for his other ventures. The day after I got an email from Board Member apologizing for his behaviour and one from Paul saying it was dealt with and he had gotten a call from one of their clients where Board Member had tried to use Pauls company as leverage a better deal for a friends company.  


I later learned that the contract Paul had with Board Member had a ""opt-out"" clause in case of events like this and that Paul managed to get his full ownership back."
