"TIFU by getting the top TIFU post deleted


First off, dear redditor, I am sorry. This is my fault.

So what happened exactly?

I woke up this morning totally excited to post my first TIFU about how I accidentally made my cat eat her own p o o yesterday. Wooohoo, exciting and funny tale. I write it all out and perfect it, only to post and have it removed! 

hmm, must be a glitch, maybe I need to flair it. 

Reposted, and bam! Same thing!

I messaged the mods asking why? Apparently there is a rule about 'scatological' content. I responded asking how the top post was able to fly by the rules (I mean the dude put a cock ring up his butt and pulled it out, soiled fingers and all). Mod was unaware and asked for the link, so I sent the link and was sent a very concise ""Thank you"".

I hit refresh and alas, his post was removed! 

I feel a crushing sense of regret and I hereby announce my debt to you of 10k karma, effective immediately.

TLDR: I accidentally snitched on a post, and my cat still ate shit"
"TIFU by eating my girlfriend out NSFW


I’m devastated by this.

Around 20 hours ago (I can’t remember), my and my SO decided to get freaky and I wanted to give her some pleasure. So I started to eat her out and we both enjoyed it.

As she reached her climax eventually, I buried my head even deeper to maximize contact, and she had a shivering orgasm. 

An extra shiver-y orgasm.

It all happened in an instant — she closed her legs uncontrollably onto my ears, and I assume that her slightly sweaty legs made a perfect seal with my ear, formed a nice chamber with my ear canal, and put high pressure onto my eardrums.

Boom. A sharp pain came through and I immediately screamed in pain. I was dizzy, in pain, naked, and wanted to vomit.

Ambulance came, picked us up (we were half-dressed), and I got into the ER at midnight. 

After some tests and a CT scan, doctor said that I have [Ossicular Chain Dislocation ](https://www.stanfordchildrens.org/en/service/hearing-center/conditions/ossicular), which basically means that my eardrum got damaged, resulting in the little bone in my left ear getting damaged too.

Surgery is required, and I’m still waiting on an expert surgeon to come. They say that hearing restoration is guaranteed, but only up to 75%.

How am I supposed to explain how I got hearing loss all of a sudden?

Worst part is that it’s nobody’s fault but my SO feels so bad for it. Seeing her in so much emotional pain breaks my heart.

I dunno guys, protect your ears when eating somebody out? 

TL;DR: Ate girlfriend out, her legs slapped my ears in during orgasm, and now my hearing is damaged."
"TIFU: by thinking my daughter was being raped and sending her bf to the hospital [NSFW]


I’m still trying to process what just happened. Today was my daughters 19th birthday and I wanted to surprise her by coming home early with a cake. I brought the cake home, slowly tip-toed to her room to surprise her and heard something I will never unhear. She was having sex with her boyfriend and saying “please stop it hurts, stop it.” I ran in, screamed for him to stop and pulled him off my daughter. I was shouting at him and my daughter was mortified and screaming at me. I threw him to ground and accidentally knocked him unconscious. My daughter was frantically explaining to me that it’s a fetish and he wasn’t actually hurting her. I told her to get dressed, found a blanket to wrap her bf in and I rushed him to the hospital. He’s doing okay now and isn’t suffering any major injuries but I feel awful. I’m not an aggressive person but it was my daughter and I truly thought he was hurting her.

TLDR; mistook my daughters fetish for her bf hurting her and knocked him unconscious"
"TIFU by being accidentally racist


So this happend 2 days ago and im still cringing.



Recently Ive taken an interest in chess and my school runs an after school chess club for beginners so I thought I'd go along. 

So anyway here I am about to play my first game of chess ever. I sit down at the black pieces and my opponent has the white pieces (I should now mention my opponent was African American). The chess teacher says ""first rule of chess, whites go first."" 

I think to myself wow that's pretty racist but chess is an old game so maybe they kept the rule out of tradition. 

So I grab a pawn and slide it forward, then I look up expecting my opponent to make his move. Instead I'm met with a look of confusion and horror, I begin to hear laughter from the people watching. 

I then realize my error ""oooh you meant the pieces"" I murmur. 
The teacher nods. 

Now everyone thinks I'm a massive racist.

TL : DR whites go first in chess refers to the pieces and not the people playing"
"TIFU By Ordering Coffee With Sunglasses On


This happened a while back.

It was a nice sunny day and I wanted to grab myself a coffee before I headed home, I stopped off at McDonald's to order a regular white coffee when it was ready I grabbed the coffee and grabbed some sugar to sweeten things up a bit. As I got to my table I opened up the lid to pour the sugar in however, when taking a glance at the coffee it looked really dark,  I just assumed the coffee was too strong or something so I headed back to the register and asked why the coffee was so dark.

When I got to the till I showed the cashier the coffee and suggested there might be something wrong with the coffee machine but she shrugged it off and offered me a new coffee without paying much attention to the one I had in hand.

A few minutes later my new coffee was ready so I grabbed some sugar and headed back to my table, yet again I took the lid off and thought the coffee was too dark. I was losing my patience at this point so I went back to the cashier and insisted there must be something wrong with the machine. There I am watching an employee inspect a coffee machine for a good 5 minutes just to say that everything was fine. 

Yet again they offered me a new coffee so I took it headed back to my table and checked it again. IT WAS STILL DARK. Instead of taking it back this time I decided to try it and to my surprise it tasted fine. Confused I sat there and decided to open my phone when I turned it on I could barely see the screen. 

It was then I realized that I HAD MY FUCKING SUNGLASSED ON THIS WHOLE TIME. So I had just wasted 2 perfectly good coffees, 10 minutes of the workers time and made a fool of myself. At this point, I was feeling stupid so I grabbed my coffee and headed out the store as quick as I could. 

TLDR: Coffee looks darker with sunglasses on."
"TIFU by putting my dick in a year old fleshlight


I bought a fleshlight back in February of 2018, using it on and off again for about 3 months until I decided to box it up for good. I had had enough of the joy the toy brought me, and had just started a relationship with my now lovely girlfriend.

Flash forward to yesterday, when I was looking through my old junk. I was bored and decided to do some (late) spring cleaning, when I came upon the box. I smirked and opened up the box to see my prized possession, the fleshlight. I put it aside for today, when I decided to use it. Out of lube, I went it dry, fuck up #1. Once I reached as far in as my lil member would let me in it, I felt a tickling sensation. Uneased I pulled out fast, giving my dick a rug burn type sensation. To my surprise, and disgust, I was met with a spider on the tip of my dick. Without thinking, I instantly flicked it off with my long ass fingernails, scraping the tip of my dick. In pain, I freaked out and let the spider get away.

My dick now hurts, and a spider is now loose in my house.

tl;dr - stuck my dick in a unused fleshlight just to find a spider on my tip, hurting myself in the process of getting it off"
"TIFU by drinking peanut butter


Quick statement, This isn't my account, but u/TheGemScout is a close friend of mine and since I don't use reddit I figure someone should get the karma, if you guys happen to enjoy my pain. (Also, this was about a week ago, not today sadly)

So lets preface this. There's an episode of Two &amp; a Half Men where Jake melts a jar of peanut butter into liquid, then He offers Charlie some. 

So I'm at my friend's house, let's call the friend Mason, and we're watching reruns of the show. We see that fatefull scene and Mason thinks it'd be a good idea to dare me to drink peanut butter. 

Two things before we proceed:

1. Our dares are intense, but we never refuse them.

2. While it's apparently weird, I despise peanut butter, not that I'm allergic or anything, but I really hate the stuff.

Knowing that refusing the dare is not an option (or else I'm going to get pranked to no end over it) I decide we should just get it over with now.

So my friend hands me the tallest coffee  mug he owns and says ""get to scooping"" while he laughs in my face

Once He's made me fill the cup with peanut butter, he puts in in the microwave for like 1:30 seconds and then motions for me to get the cup before it hardens. Here's where my fuckup begins:

I drink coffee often, so I'm not very careful about it being hot, and assume it's much MUCH cooler than my typical coffee as I heat that up for about 2 minutes or more before I drink it. 1 minute is nothing to me, and Seeing as I'm not trying to taste this disgusting flavor of nutty origin, I try to slam it down as fast as possible.

Actually the biggest mistake of my life, as not only does peanut butter heat up MUCH faster than a typical liquid, It's VERY thick and Insanely sticky. It was like Satan came in my mouth but it was stuck there and I couldn't get it out. My friend is still laughing his ass of and I'm screaming at the top of my lungs as it goes further into my throat and I begin choking on the molten shit-liquid itsself. At this level I'm thinking ""I'm choking on lava"" and ""I really hope I don't die because of the one time I eat peanut butter""

In my suffering I finally stammer out ""Take me to the ER"" and his face Immediately changed
 
I go for the milk we have in the fridge so I can walk out the door, but lucky me; we have not one drop of milk, nor any other liquid other than fucking A1 sauce, so I grab the sprayer in my kitchen sink and start blasting it in my mouth so as to mitigate the damage, but I can already tell that I've got some pretty severe burns.

Flash forward to the Hospital, and Thanks to my idiocy I have second degree burns all over my mouth and throat, and After almost a week, I'm still in constant pain. I can't taste anything except pain, I have burns on and around my tongue, my gums The roof of my mouth, my throat, and Can barely sleep due to the intensity of the pain.

FML, and Fuck peanut butter. Never drink it, or you'll end up like me.


TL;DR: Got dared to drink melted peanut butter. Slammed it down to avoid Taste. Hot peanut butter is Basically Napalm and Hot PB + Mouth = Second Degree Burns."
"TIFU by smashing some girls teeth as a first impression.


This just happened a couple hours ago. Just a bit of context to start out. 

I'm moving into a flat with some great people in a couple of months and they invited me around for a few drinks as it was one of their birthdays. It was a bunch of about 20 of us and it was kind of a who knows who type situation.

It was a great time, everyone was getting along well, quite a few drinks, dancing, bit of beer pong. I met this girl called Jess (not real name) and we got talking and she had the most amazing teeth and smile I've probably ever seen. Perfect set of pearly whites and she was gorgeous.

Fast forward a couple of hours and we are all heading home, I'm pretty bad with women so classic me I don't make a move and just start walking home. It's about a 20 minute walk across town so nothing too bad but not ideal.

As I'm walking up the road I here Jess shout to me saying ""Which way are you going?"" 
We find out we can kind of walk halfway home and split ways there. We're stumbling along with some playful banter and she jokingly tries to trip me up, I'm drunk but not that bad so I manage not to slam the concrete.
In return I jokingly trip her up and here's the TIFU. She falls like a 20 metre tall tree straight as a pole and slams the concrete. I feel so bad and instantly picked her up, she has a bloody nose and I'm freaking out because I've just slammed this Gorgeous girl into the ground.

She gets up, asks is her face okay and as she says it, I see her two front teeth are BOTH missing. My heart sank. I felt terrible. Never felt so bad in my life. I let her know the situation and she bursts out crying. 

I call an ambulance and we got to A&amp;E where we sit for 4 hours waiting to be seen to be eventually told go home and go to the dentist tomorrow. In the 4 hours we did get to know each other really well I had a mixture of feeling terrible and attracted to her at the same time.

I pay for the taxis home as it's the least I can do and take her in and she invited me in for a coffee with her face still fucked up. We chat for a couple hours about random stuff and as I leave she says I'd actually like to see you again, but maybe once this whole situation is fixed up ya know.

TLDR: Went to drinks, tripped up attractive Lady. Went to A&amp;E got to know each other really well. Now have a date"
"TIFU By Telling My Coworkers I Like Kiddie Porn.


This happened a few hours ago but I need to back up to last night to give a proper explanation.   

I’ve started watching Chernobyl on HBO since GOT is over. I’m digging it so far and watched episode 3 last night. There’s a scene where a group of 100 guys are digging tunnels under the nuclear reactor and it’s hot. They can’t use fans due to dust and blah blah blah so these men strip completely naked while they work. My immature ass thinks this is HILARIOUS! I saw more junk in that 30 second scene than I’ve seen in 10 years. I’m giggling like a middle schooler pointing at all the television. My boyfriend didn’t find it as funny, but that’s another story. The episode ends, all is well and I go to bed.  

Then, this morning is when the fuck up happens. I’m chatting with some coworkers during break and someone asks me how my night was. My poor attempt at being funny was to respond with, “It was pretty awesome, I saw a bunch of naked miners.” Everybody kind of froze and just stared at me....I didn’t clue in for the longest time. I just stared blankly back them. Nobody laughed at all and I could feel my anxiety closing my throat when it dawned on me. They thought I said naked MINORS! 

The English language is fucked up sometimes!   I quickly explained what I was actually talking about. Everybody got a great kick out of it but I’m still the office creep now.  

TL:DR I said I saw a bunch of naked MINERS, but everyone thought I said naked MINORS."
"TIFU By Getting My Tonsils Removed


I like many people in adulthood have had to deal with the annoyance of overgrown tonsils. From the 3-4 times a year tonsillitis to the sleep apnea that they cause. Personally, I wanted my tonsils gone.

After getting tonsillitis for the second time this year l decided enough is enough, I booked an appointment with my GP, referred to the surgeon and made a date for the surgery.

I was warned that I was In for the sorest throat of my life and that it was going to be agony for a while. Which was ok. How bad could it be?

Day 1:
I was prepped and ready to go, surprisingly not too nervous for my first major surgery. 

The procedure went well, my tonsils were gone and I was all set to recover in hospital. The pain wasn’t to high yet, I was still spaced out from the drugs. so all in all the first night was quite easy.

Day 2:

4AM: 
I woke up needing to go to the bathroom, I felt like I needed to spit so I rushed over to the bathroom sink. I spat out a few mouthfuls of blood not thinking to much of it. I slowly shuffled back to my bed and quickly fell back asleep

7:30AM:
This time I awoke to a lot of pain, I buzzed the nurse to get my dose of endone and panodol. I mentioned to her that I had bled a little overnight. She was immediately concerned, she passed me a plastic cup and told me to spit all the blood that comes up from now. 

(I thought that leaking blood would be common as it was when I got my wisdom teeth out)

For the next few hours slowly but surely I was filling up this cup that looked more and more like red wine. It was horrible because the pain was quite high regardless of the pain killers, I couldn’t lie down and rest as the blood would go into my stomach.

10pm: 
The nurses tried to use a ice pack on my neck and give me countless icy poles to freeze stop the blood but nothing was working, I had filled almost two cups now and they decided it was time to call my surgeon.

They broke the bad news to me and told me I needed to be prepped for surgery again. I was surprisingly ok with it. I remained calm and collected. I went through the whole procedure again of getting countless needles and being sedated (FUN!)

Post 2nd surgery: I was back where I was today but hopefully no more bleeding! The surgeon informed me that a blood vessel had hemorrhaged around my tonsil area causing blood to leak. I had have blood sucked out of my stomach because I had indeed swallowed quite a bit of blood. 

He told me that this complication only happens once a year for him! (Lucky me)

Day 3-4
The recovery was brutal and painful, I was in bed all day, struggling to get any solids down as the pain was to bad to swallow. However no complications.

Day 5:
For anyone who has had the pleasure of having a tonsillectomy you would know that the most painful part about it is waking up from a snooze. 

I learnt that the best thing to do is get up drink some water and have some meds ASAP!

I was getting out of the shower when I felt a large amount of liquid in my mouth, I leaned over the sink and spat out blood!

Here is a picture of the sink
https://m.imgur.com/kpxtoMf

My mum who had been amazing throughout this whole thing was luckily around the corner from my home when this happened. So I called her and we decided the safest bet would be returning to hospital.
 
I felt very unwell in the car ride, and I was pale as a ghost, they quickly put an IV in and gave me fluids. 

After a VERY long wait we were advised by my surgeon to return home and come back in if it were to happen again.

I returned home and rested up for a few hours, it was around 9pm when I felt the same liquid taste in the back of my throat, this time I knew. I rushed to the bathroom and proceeded to cough up blood

Here’s a photo of this time
http://imgur.com/s2YFx39

As you can see it’s much more this time around. 

I don’t know if you have ever had the displeasure of coughing up blood but the worst part about it is just how sticky blood is. It sticks to your tongue, throat and lips resulting blood clots getting stuck in your mouth. It’s horrible.

I called my mum and she rushed over to come get me. 

Back to hospital again and another IV :D 

I was admitted back to the ward and I stayed over night, my night wasn’t overly dramatic. I bled once around 3-4am but it only lasted 5 minutes so there wasn’t much for concern.

DAY 6!!!!
Things were looking ok, I was still in a lot of pain but I had not bled outside of the little one in the morning.

1pm:
I was watching shitty day time tv as I reached to have a sip of water, I felt that same feeling in my throat come on and it felt heavy quick. 

I had no time to react so I grabbed the smoothie cup I had received from my mum and proceeded to spit mouthfuls of blood into it I was trying to get a hold of my buzzer to notify the nurse. 

They came in shortly after and rushed to get me a vomit bag, it was coming FAST. The nurses were trying to keep me calm and they again, put a ice pack behind my neck to try and slow down the bleeding. I kept coughing it up. I started making gagging noises as the blood was sticking and clotting around my throat.

I started to feel light headed. within seconds of saying that, That I fainted.

I woke up seconds later to the ward now being in code red, I had never seen so many nurses and doctors in one room so fast. There must of been 15-20 people in this small room. I had needles going into my arms, a oxygen mask being put on, and multiple nurses and doctors talking to me

“Raph stay with us”

“Raph look at me, keep your eyes open”

This was the first time in my life that I genuinely was scared for my life.

I could overhear that they were trying to get ahold of my surgeon, because once again I needed emergency surgery. 

I was rushed into theatre and they prepped me again. Giving me another IV there was a delay because my surgeon was finishing up surgery for another patient at another hospital.

It was at this moment where I broke down crying. I felt so sick, all I could taste was blood, I was scared, alone. I didn’t know what was going to happen to me. All the while I was still coughing up a lot of blood. 

After sometime had passed the nurse with me was starting to panic.

“We need to get him into theatre now!”

They kept trying to give me oxygen but I kept coughing blood into the mask.

My surgeon arrived and I was put to sleep.

I woke up in unbearable pain and agony, it was the worst pain I had felt since this whole thing began. But that quickly changed when I was given morphine.

I rested up and was eventually moved back into the ward and I was greeted by my mum and nan. My poor mother had been through hell. She had only just left before it all went down. She was balling her eyes out the whole time I was going through it all. Blaming herself for leaving :( 

Day 7
I got a big sleep and I woke up to my surgeon checking in on me. He was truly sorry for my ordeal, and said I was the worst luck he had ever seen.

The cause was the same as last time, a vessel had opened up and caused the bleeding.

All in all I lost 800ml of blood from that ordeal
That’s is almost a 5th of total blood!

I was told that if I wasn’t in the ward when it happened there was a good chance I could of died.

Day 8-9
I stayed in hospital. Everyone agreed that it was the best place for me, just Incase thunder struck three times.

I was pretty shook on day 8 still. But as soon as word got out that it went from standard procedure to almost fatal I was receiving a lot of love from my family and friends. 

Twitch kept me sane throughout 
my stay. All my streaming buddies reached out and wished me well which all contributed to making me feel better.

Day 10: 

I am typing to you all from my phone! This is probably the longest thread I have ever written on reddit and I don’t normally post much but I wanted to share my story because this will stick with me for the rest of my life. 

Each day I’m feeling more and more strong. My pain still sucks but it’s getting less severe and I haven’t bled since! I’m out of hospital being very well taken care of by my mother. 

As cliche as it sounds. This whole experience made me very grateful for not only my life but more importantly the doctors, nurses, surgeons, paramedics etc that go through so much stress to help us fellow humans live the lives we live.

I can’t wait to be back in full health and hopefully I can play some games and get some streams in before I go back to work! ;) 

PS: please excuse my horrible grammar at times. This whole thing was typed on my phone in bed, appreciate you all &lt;3

TL;DR: I got the procedure of getting my tonsils out and potentially could of died!"
"TIFU by accidentally hosting an ant fight club


Recently I've been finding these big black ants in my house, only like one at a time.  The first one crawled on me so I smacked it by instinct. This ant died in the most dramatic way I have ever seen. It was almost too much, like this ant had studied drama under Jim Carrey. I know its just an ant, but I really felt like an asshole. So I decided to catch &amp; release these ants in the future to spare myself a repeat performance. Tonight, I catch three of these ants but I really didn't want to go outside because its late, there are mosquitoes, &amp; I had just watched a scary movie so I was creeped out.

I just place them all under a plastic container.  I figured ants are social, right? Wrong. These ants had clearly come from rival gangs or something because when I came back about 10 minutes later and one of the ants is in an unrecognizable heap on the ground. He looked like he had been stabbed 50 times, two of his legs were torn off. It. was. not. pretty.

So in my quest to be a more compassionate human, I accidentally subjected this ant to a real-life horror movie and am currently harboring two ant murderers who seem to have absolutely no remorse for their crime. 

TLDR: I'm currently harboring two ant murderers who viciously slaughtered another ant after I (forcibly) invited them to stay in my pop-up ant motel for the night so I could release them in the morning."
"TIFU by letting my kid lay in my lap NSFW


This happened last night. My wife and I were settling down for the evening and sat down on the couch to watch TV while our 13-month old played on the floor. After a short time he apparently decided he wanted to cuddle up on the couch with us. He climbed up on the couch and crept up close to me with a smile and the lates his head down flat on my thigh. It was close to his bed time so I didn’t give it a second thought.

We were both really into the show we were watching when suddenly I felt a sharp pain on the top of my penis. I mean like a turtle had just reached out and latched on. I screamed in pain at first and looked down to realize my son had shifted his head slightly against the shorts I was wearing, and just chomped down. He may still be a baby but he has some sharp ass teeth.

I grabbed him to get him off and my wife didn’t understand what was happening. She thought I was just randomly in pain and trying to throw our son. It looked like that, well, because he wouldn’t freaking let go. I finally tugged him away and to the floor and he screamed crying as my wife went to console him and I got up and cupped a hand to my crotch and paced back and forth with a feeling I’d never felt before.

I walked outside to get away from the crying for a moment and stinging pain wasn’t stopping. After a few moments I returned inside and looked inside my pants to survey the damage. My penis was bleeding from the tip. He left a freaking indention with his teeth. Still hurts today every time anything brushes against it. I’ll be way more cautious going forward about where he’s laying his head. My wife later laughed and called him amazing birth control.

TL;DR Let my kid lay on my lap and found out how sharp his teeth are. Now I’ve got a cut and sore penis."
"TIFU by asking a bartender if he had a handjob for me




So, a little context.

I live in Spain. I am not from Spain. In spanish, we have different words that mean the same depending the country. Think of it as the cookie/biscuit of latin america and Spain.

Today, I went to this big event they had in my city. I had to walk a lot to get there, so I was thirsty when I arrived. I decided to get to the nearest bar/pub so I could get something to drink. I enter the bar and ask for a cold tea, and the bartender gives me the can and I pay.

Here's when things go wrong.

I was going to walk more, so I thought it was more comfortable to drink from a straw.

Now, here's the thing. In Spain, ""paji**t**a"" means straw, and ""paji**ll**a"" means handjob. 

I get close to him, and I ask him:

- *Wouldn't you have a handjob for me?*

The guy looks at me, confused and angry at the same time.

+ *Do I have a what for you?*

I ask again, firmly:


- *A handjob, you know.*


The guy looks even more confused. He says, in a very confused tone

+ *No.*

Minding my business, I thank him and get out of the bar. It wasn't until 30 minutes ago I heard a friend of mine using the correct word for straw, and it dawned on me.

I asked the bartender for a handjob without knowing. Fuck. My. Life.

TL;DR: confused words for straw and handjob in Spanish, ended asking the bartender a handjob."
"TIFU by saying my best friends wife might have cheated on him, during their speaker phone call to announce their pregnancy.


Just a simple fuck up that I made a few months ago, but I thought it would be fitting. 

My friend has been in an off and on again relationship with a really great girl. However, there was a point in which she was cheating on him. This time has passed (as far as we all know) and they are happily married now and expecting a baby in the next few months. 

Anyway, the day he called me to tell me the news is when I fucked up. I get the call, and i can tell that I am on speaker phone. I had no idea that his girl was also on the call with us. He says something along the lines of..

""Guess what man!! Me and (So and so) are having a baby!!""

Me, being the unfiltered and untrusting idiot that I am.. replies 

""DUDE YOU BETTER MAKE SURE THAT BABY IS ACTUALLY YOURS BRO!! Get a DNA test done immediately. She might be tryna get you to pay for another's dudes baby!!""

And of course, that comment is followed by a very long and ackward pause, until he says..

""Um. Oh no, haha. It's mine. (So and So) is actually here in the car with me. Your on speaker dude...""

And that is the moment I knew I fucked up. 

""Oh......... hey (so and so). Congrats guys!!! LOVE YOU BYE!!!""

TL ; DR    I fucked up by telling my buddy his wife may have gotten impregnated by another dude, while she was also listening to the call on speaker. All they wanted to do was share the good news with me."
"TIFU (UPDATE) by letting my manager know I had sex with her daughter and that I took a pic of her too


Original post: [https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/buxuye/tifu\_by\_letting\_my\_manager\_know\_i\_had\_sex\_with/?utm\_source=share&amp;utm\_medium=web2x](https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/buxuye/tifu_by_letting_my_manager_know_i_had_sex_with/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x)

Sorry for the long wait for those wondering what happened. First off, wow, I am a fucking idiot and so are my friends. Anyways, I probably stayed in the bathroom for a solid 30-40 minutes figuring out what I could possibly do to save my ass after writing the original reddit post. I decided to go back and just come out clean since there was no way I could save this especially after the text message notification. It would've been possible to do so if my friend didn't text that at the same exact moment, but that just sealed the deal. First thing i did was to show her that the pic was deleted for sure and that she could look at my phone if she didn't believe me. I told her that I had a thing with her daughter this year and found her (the manager) attractive, so I ended up telling my friends about it, who became interested. I also said that my friends and I were being completely immature about the whole situation, and that I would understand if there were any consequences. Somehow, she was being considerate and could see that I was fucking trembling (also i am an intern, so I guess that helps since im young). She replied back by thanking me for the compliment but what i did was completely unacceptable and would get me fired anywhere else. She said that she'll let this go (probably understands that i'm an idiot, but also young), and that she will have a talk with her daughter tonight...

Currently, it is the night, and I am scared as fuck to go back to work tomorrow because I have no clue what the daughter will say. I will update tomorrow.

TL : DR; I come out clean to my manager and she understands. Says she has to talk to her daughter about me though... Will update tomorrow"
"TIFU by video calling myself naked to my crush


This happened a few moments ago 

Context: So I have a crush on this girl from my class, we're friends, although I don't know if I'll be able to say the same when I get to school tomorrow.

As usual, after getting in bed I did my daily business, fully naked, no clothes on. It was about 11:45pm.

I took my phone and opened whatsapp, so that I could use my crush's profile pic as ""inspiration"". I click on her profile picture to maximize it and have a better view. Remember that when you have someone's pfp like that, there are four buttons under it, for calling, video calling, chatting and info.

Everything goes as normal, I finish doing my thing and grab a pair of dirty boxers I had laying next to me to clean myself up. All of this while in the dark of my bedroom, as my phone screen as the only light source.

As I can't see too well, I direct my phone at the ""cleaning area"" with my screen. Because I'm laid down, when I direct the screen towards me, my thumb is placed under the phone and on the screen, holding most of the weight.

My phone was in silent mode and the call volume and any other sound it could make were off (as to avoid waking up my parents whatever the situation was).

As I'm using the screen for lighting, I accidentally press the video call button, but I can't see what's happening on the screen, it's facing down. 

SHE ANSWERS.

I don't hear her, I can't even imagine the horror that I'm about to realise. I finish cleaning, I face the phone towards me and I see her. By default, when video calling, it activates the front camera first, meaning she saw everything. 

I immediately hang up and feel a cold wave of panic over all of my body. 

Fuck.

I don't even know if I should go to school tomorrow. I'm f**king panicking.

**tl;dr** I accidentally video called my crush while cleaning up after having masturbated"
"TIFU by watching porn on a hot day


This happened a few hours ago

So a little backstory: I live with a flatmate who is never home, I had a day off from classes and decided to 'treat my self' with a nice hot steaming bath.

So, it was a hot day today and I decided to take a bath. I ALWAYS take a shower so I had no idea how to set the bath's temperature correctly, I accidently got it to be a little too warm. 

I decide to treat myself even further with a plate of nachos, guacamole and my laptop on a table high enough for me to reach as I'm in the bath. I take my clothes off, step in and realize it a little too warm for my comfort but it ain't no biggy, I lay down and 'relax' but my horny teenager hormones hit me all of a sudden. I. HAVE. TO. WATCH. PORN. 

I get on my laptop, turn from watching an episode of parks and rec into brazzers, put on a 3 hour porn video and begin beating my meat. For some reason it suddenly starts getting too hot, my forehead is full of sweat and my heart is pounding, I feel like I wanna pass out.

I beat my meat furiously at this point, my heart rate increasing with every stroke, it feels like I'm gonna have a Heartattack and just as soon as I orgasm, I pass out. 

A few minutes later I'm awoken up by the sound of my flatmate breaking the door of the toilet and the unmistakable sound of a woman being pounded into oblivion, her moans loud and clear as day. My flatmate got home early today with his friend from work who I never met, they broke in because they needed the toilet and I never opened it for them. 

I'm still in my bedroom hiding until this embarrassing event is forgotten by all parties, I think it will take a few years... FML

TLDR: flatmate and his friend found me passed out in bathtub with porn blaring out of my laptop"
"TIFU by smoking in my backyard while my dad slept on the couch


An actual TIFU. 

Typically I smoke a joint before I go to bed every night, but tonight my Dad fell asleep on the couch. I attempted to sneak out anyway without disturbing him so I could smoke. 

I was able to unlock the door and get out there, but I guess the noise woke him up. I could see him through the window as I got outside and as he began to get up I ducked down hoping he wouldn’t see me. I sat down there for a couple minutes, and figured he would have already come out if he heard the door open. 

I stand up and slowly peek through the kitchen window. My father is literally standing there in the middle of the kitchen with a fucking gun in his hand, while on the phone. He sees me peek, completely under the impression that I’m a stranger trying to break into our home. I ducked down and screamed for him as loud as I could, hoping he could recognize my voice. I continued to scream and bang on the siding until he ran outside and realized it was me. 

My dad legitimately almost killed me. All for a fucking joint that I had to stomp up anyway because the cops were on their way. They thought it was pretty funny, but I felt really bad because they sent a good amount of cars out for nothing to even be wrong. 

My dad also laughed when I told him I went outside to smoke, and told me he wouldn’t have even cared. 

TL;DR snuck outside to smoke a joint. Dad heard me open the door and woke up from the couch. I ducked down to hide, but when I got up and peeked through the window, he had a gun in his hand. He saw me and thankfully didn’t kill me."
"TIFU by telling a black lady to go to the back of the bus because she’ll feel more comfortable there


So this wasn’t today but a couple of years ago. I would take the bus to work. My house was close to the bus station so I would be one of the first people on the bus and I would always sit near the front. The ride was somewhat long so we picked up quite a few people along the way. There was 2 stops that a lot of people would get on/off. 

Anyways on this particular day I was sitting down on one of the bench style seats next to the pole. So obviously it was a bit tight for me. A black woman came on the bus and she had a big bag. She set it down next to her and then tried to squeeze in between the back and me. Needless to say it was hard for her to get in. And I literally couldn’t scoot over more because of the pole. So then I looked at at her and said “excuse me, I think you’ll be more comfortable in the back” I said this because the back had a lot of space. She looked at me and said “excuse me?!” She refused to give up trying to squeeze in, so I just stood up. This lady seemed very angry and I didn’t want to escalate things. For the rest of the ride she would stare at me very angrily. 

Later that day I told my buddy about this and he laughs and says “well yeah you pissed her off, you told her she belongs on the back of the bus you tried to Rosa Parks her”.... that had never even occurred to me until he told me that. 

TLDR: I told a black lady she would feel more comfortable on the back of the bus."
"TIFU by accidentally getting “freaky” with my boyfriend’s twin while he was sleeping because I thought it was him


This actually happened yesterday, but some of the mortification has died down enough that I find it slightly humorous. So my boyfriend, his twin brother, and a few of our other friends/couples are on vacation together. My boyfriend and I have been together since we were 20 years old (we’re now 26) and I have a great brother/sister relationship with his brother. We’re all close. After yesterday, maybe now too close. 

So anyway, we’re all having a great day at the beach when my boyfriend, his brother and a few other people decide they want to go back to the house to get ready to go get food for everyone. After a while, I also decide I want to go back and have a shower. 
Let me preface this by saying my boyfriend and his brother are the type of twins that look exactly alike, but once you look at their faces and hang around them for more than 5 minutes, you’ll always be able to tell them apart. It’s very easy to distinguish the two. Usually. So I walk in and no one else is there besides my boyfriend (or so I thought) passed out on the couch, his front facing into the back of the couch. So I think to myself “huh, maybe he was tired and didn’t want to go” while I go take my shower. After I’m done, I decide to take this opportunity of alone time and decide to have some fun and play with him to get him awake (and hopefully some sexy time). So I make my way to the couch and lay myself flat against his back, hugging my arms around him. I should probably also mention that both men can sleep through a hurricane, and it takes an army to wake them up. So here I am, cuddling up to his back (his face still facing the couch) and I start to massage his chest, kiss and bite his neck, do things that I know he likes.... while he slowly starts stirring around and then goes still. I started talking and asked if he wants to go to the bedroom while still kissing his neck when he turns completely around and looks me right in the face. And then bursts out laughing. It took me a second to catch up when I realize that IT’S IS ACTUALLY NOT MY BOYFRIEND’S NECK I’VE JUST MAULED. I jump up and start freaking out with apologizes, all while he’s laughing so hard he can’t even sit up. After my boyfriend gets back and we relay what happened, he also bursts out laughing. Actually, they’re still laughing about it now, as I type this. I’ll probably never live it down. 

TL;DR I should have thought to myself “is that ___ on the couch or is it ___?” Instead of assuming it was my boyfriend, and not his brother, before I decided to make my move, because I totally fucked up"
"Tifu when my wife found my Crayolas


This fuckup didn’t happen today but I’m paying for it right now. 
My wife (or maybe ex-wife) usually works during the day while I work nights and weekend so we don’t really meet in terms of having time for the hanky pankies. She runs a daycare (this is important) and we have a ton of brand new toys stored in our basement for the business. Well me being me and bored I came across hundreds of boxes of crayons. In my never ending boredom after coloring stuff I was thinking what if I melt this into shapes. I’m not gonna explain how exactly I made these molds in my workshop because that’s more of a diy tutorial. Anyways after about 15 attempts of melting and molding, I finally make the perfect crayoladick. Then I started mixing colors etc. eventually I had made about 50 of these all different colors and sizes. So we have this dog named Bonkers and he’s a curious son of a dog. He roams free around the house and must have snuck in and grabbed one behind my back. Now you know how I said we work different shifts. Well wife home from work and I’m on my weekend shift still (Friday - Sunday) and my wife starts blowing up my phone. I guess Bonkers had dropped it in the toilet and wife found it thinking I was using it. Now I’m being accused of cheating on her with the crayons. She wouldn’t answer my calls so I text her that I made these in the garage. It doesn’t go over so well when she find 50 melted crayons phaluses in which I used the daycare’s crayons to make them. I’m heading home soon and I haven’t talked to wife since she found them. 

Tldr: don’t melt crayons into weird stuff."
"TIFU by throwing a condom out my car window


So this happened about 5 years ago, but due to being new to reddit, I’ve never shared the story before. Anyways, I recently had started dating this girl, and one night we decide to go for a drive, as my parents were home and we were both feeling frisky. We get to a good spot, and I pull over and we get in the back seat. When the deed is done, I need to dispose of the condom I just used, so I pull up to a dumpster just down to the street and fling the condom out the window into the dumpster. Given it was very dark outside, I didn’t actually see the condom go into the dumpster, but I assumed I had made a perfect shot. 

The following morning, I had my mom bring my car in for maintenance, as the only appointment available was during the school day. About 10 minutes before the appointment started, I get multiple phone calls from my mom and decide to step out of class, as it might be an emergency. As soon as I answer the phone, my mom says “what the fuck,” which I knew was really bad, as she never swears. She tells me that when she got out to fill my tank up, she noticed a used condom stuck to the side of the car door. It turns out when I had thrown it out the window, it hooked around my finger and stuck to the side of my car door. My mom had driven my car all around town, and ran multiple errands with my used condom splattered on the car door. I still cringe thinking about it today. 

TL;DR: had sex in my car with my girlfriend and tried to throw my used condom out the window into a dumpster. Instead it hooked on my finger, sticking to the car door for my mom to discover the following morning."
"TIFU by masturbating high at work and passing out [NSFW]


This happened last thursday but Im still very terrified at the thought of this ever getting out. Im married and work at a fabrication plant in the offices. I get moderately high at work a few times a week like a lot of people here do. Not a smart thing to do, i will admit that. I wont go into too much detail other than i do a lot of data entry, very monotonous. 

Got to work at 7, get some tasks and emails out and hit my vape pen with a thc cartridge at about 8. At 9 which is breaktime, im roughly at a (4), little more than a headchange. Coffee has given me bubbleguts so I head to the shitter upstairs, instead of the one neareast me. I had no idea how good of a decision this was until later. I do this bc there are a higher ratio of female employees upstairs so i dont have to wait for a stall as much as the crowded one on ground floor. 

Go in, no one is there so im thinking hell ya ill drop these turds and maybe rub one out if i can. This is also nothing new as i have jerked it plenty of times at work. So the bowels are empty and im on xvideos, midway thru a sunny lane doggy scene and getting close. Due to the fact that these stalls are narrower than the ones downstairs, my leg starts to cramp. Instead of finishing in a handful of TP, i decide ill stand up , tuck back, and blast my seed into the toilet.

I stand up quickly to execute my plan, start to cum, and everything goes black. I come to out of foggy blackout world and im laying on my side. One of the stoner maintenance guys is shaking me loudly whispering hey dude! Wake the fuck up! Hurry man cmon! I have no idea what has happened but my phone is beside me still displaying the now stopped video. He goes look man put your dick in your pants. Breaks been over for a couple minutes someone will be here any time. Hurry the fuck up. Im still very dulled but quickly get penis in pants and my stomach feels sick. Christ im getting fired. 
He says look im not judging and i wont say shit but if someone else had found you, youd be in serious shit. 

Apparently when i stood up, the drop in BP, coupled with thc and endorphins from climax gave me an instant KO. He says fix yourself man i gotta go back to the floor. He unlocks the door to which i say whyd u lock the door? He goes well i walked in and half of you is laid out under the stall, dick out, and phone on floor with porn. I need a job like you do so i tried to help and hoping you werent dead or somethin. I thank him a LOT, and im about to cry. He laughs a lil and says its cool man dont worry i wont say shit. BUT, for real, do you know where i can get some flower? Ive seen you vaping but they hirt my chest. I say yeah ill holler at you after work. 

He leaves. I have a red mark on my face from laying on the floor and red eyes. Go back to my office, put drops in, and nervously try to shake this whole thing off which is pretty much impossible. By 3pm, ive calmed down but scared that this person, while helpful, may very well have taken pictures of my extremely exposed situation. Italk to him in the parking lot where we laugh about it, mine is forced. Tell him ill find some flower and we part ways. 

I do NOT tell my wife as she will undoubtedly be mega pissed. She doesnt have a problem with MJ generally, but doing it at work, jerking off in a stall and blacking out will be a bad fucking deal. As I previously stated, im still on edge when i think about the very real possibility of this coming back to bite me, even after being insanely lucky. FML. 

TLDR, masturbating at work while high and passing out is extremely risky. You probably wont be saved by a fellow pothead samaritan."
"TIFU by throwing a high-pitched ringing device in a public trash bin and ran away


I’ve been a type 1 diabetic since I was 8 years old. I wear two devices on me at all times; a wireless constant glucose monitor (CGM) that allows me to track my blood sugar on my phone, and a wireless insulin pump known as an OmniPod. The pump pods are disposable - I put a new one on every 3 days or so. 

One annoying thing about the pump is that, if the pod fails for whatever reason prior to expiration, it lets out a shrill, constant alarm. There are two ways to shut this alarm off: using my device to disarm it and replace the pod, or, in the rare event I don’t have my device or it can’t make a connection, using a paper clip to break through a tiny hole on the back and poke its insides until it stops. 

Fast forward to today, in a highly public place, my pod fails and lets out its cry. People are nervously looking around as I run into the bathroom, tear it off of my upper thigh, and attempt to disarm it. We can’t make a connection. I’m banging it on the toilet, hoping it’ll crack. These things are indestructible, apparently. 

I run out of the bathroom, looking for someplace I can find a paper clip. Nothing. So, in a last ditch effort, I shove it far down in a trash bin, cover it up with some trash to hopefully mask some of the noise, and book it. 

Not far from the door, two Chicago PD step in front of me and ask if they can speak to me for a moment. It hits me that I’ve just shoved an alarming device deep within a trash bin and ran away from it. 

The first cop asks me what I put in the trash back there. “What the hell was that thing?” 

“It’s my insulin pump.” 

“You just threw your insulin pump away?” He asked, unconvinced. 

I explained the whole thing to him, and I guess I rambled. He still wasn’t sold. They radio for other cops to come stare at me. 

A half an hour passes and they’ve take me outside to their car. How is it humid and cold at the same time today? Why did I just wear a T-shirt? Ugh my T-shirt has so many tears in it because I think I’m fashionable, but now I just look like a dick. 

Another cop has brought out my pump. They have it on the hood of another cop car; I can still hear it ringing. I guess a bomb dog is coming. What a good boy! 

“I can prove it to you!” I’m showing him the Omnipod device and googling pictures of pods. He seems more convinced, since this thing hasn’t exploded, yet, and he found out about my food blog. 

“Where’s your favorite steak?” The other cop asks me. 

One of the newer cops says his cousin has one of these and it did this at the bar one time. 

The moral of the story is to always carry a paper clip in your pocket, you never know when you’ll need it.

TL;DR TIFU by throwing my failed, alarming disposable insulin pump in a public trash bin because I couldn’t disarm it. Then spent the morning trying to explain to the Chicago PD that it wasn’t a bomb and why I’d throw my insulin pump away."
