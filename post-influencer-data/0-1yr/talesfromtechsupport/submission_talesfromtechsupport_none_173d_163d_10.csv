"Meth. Not even once.


As I've pointed out in prior tales, I provide support for a hospital. 

I got called down to the ER about two hours ago, because one of their shiny new COWs (Computer on wheels) was having problems staying connected to their shiny new EMR (Electronic Medical Record). Curiously, the workstation was not losing it's connection to anything else, just momentarily dropping it's connection to the EMR. The EMR itself is hosted offsite. Their preferred method of connection (dig this crap) is to connect to their server via RDP. Yeah, it sucks. For it to work we had to NAT a series of addresses for each machine, which was statically assigned. It is very finicky and has to be logged into and out of a certain way, as it's well... poorly made. 

But none of that even remotely matters, because when I got to the ER...

The nurse called me over to one of the rooms. ""It just happened!"" I go in to take a cursory glance and come across a patient, in her nightgown, writhing on her ER bed. She might be 25, but she has the look of a 40 year old weathered saddlebag. Writhing may not be the word I'm looking for. Twitching, perhaps. And chewing on invisible food. And dancing on her bed to inaudible music. 

Ah, meth, you silly rascal, it's 8:30 AM. Never too early for a little bump, am I right?

Her companion, a gaunt, nearly-skeletal man in dirty jeans and what was probably once a nice shirt, is sitting next to her, in a similar state of jankiness, eyes darting wildly, tonguing some kind of invisible candy.

The nurse and I roll the ailing COW out of the room and close the curtain and the sliding glass door.

Funny thing about curtains. They're just opaque enough to block your sight, but just transparent enough to allow you to see the silhouette of someone on the other side. In this particular case, as soon as we left the room, we got the privilege of seeing two silhouettes engaging in some rowdy, drug-fueled, hospital bed sex.

Oh, meth, don't you go changing.

Shaken, but undeterred, I herd the COW back to the nurses station and begin some diagnostic stuff which I won't bore you with because honestly, the sideshow was so much more entertaining.

After a few minutes, the fellow emerged from his friend's room, buttoning his pants. He sauntered over to the linen cart, grabbed a few towels and sheets, and simply walked out of the door. Yeah, that's right. He stole hospital towels. These things barely qualify as towels to begin with, but, there you go. Within a few more minutes, he was back, strolling in with all of the smoothness of a shopping cart with a broken wheel, and herky-jerked his way back into her room for round two. He didn't manage to close the sliding door all the way, so this time we were granted an audible addition to the show. Truly entertaining.

I've now gotten the problem narrowed down to the WiFi driver, and began doing the work to fix it. In the meantime, round two has subsided, and the fella pops back out, raids the linen cart a second time, and disappears out of the waiting room door and into the morning sun. Why does he need so many crappy towels? The people need to know.

At this point, the nursing staff moves the linen cart into the locked med room behind the nurses' station, as well as anything else this fellow can steal out of, and notifies the local police of what's going on. Before the authorities can arrive, however, he's back again. He ambles around, asking, ""Hey, man, the bathroom. Is there a bathroom, Gotta use the bathroom,"" like Rain Man demanding to watch Judge Wapner.

He is pointed in the direction of the public restroom, wherein he stays for just a few moments, before walking out with an armload of toilet paper.

The computer doesn't exist anymore. This unfolding drama is my world now.

Just in time, Johnny Law comes in, takes a short statement from the staff, and then exits the ER to find Romeo himself strolling back in. One short conversation later, he's spread over the front of their cruiser, a substantial baggie of crystal meth and a crappy, now broken glass pipe laying on the hood next to him, as they pull his hands behind his back to receive his new steel bracelets. He gets tossed unceremoniously into the back of the car, a situation we are informed later that he is very well acquainted with. He also receives an all-expenses paid trip to the pokey.

As for the other principal players in this little show- 

&amp;#x200B;

The lady friend, as of my knowledge, is still back in the ER, likely dosed up on Ativan or something, heck I don't know, I fix computers, not people.

The computer is working fine.

The nurse is completely unphased. When I asked, she said ""Same crap as always"". 

The linens and toilet paper are still unaccounted for, the greatest heist since D. B. Cooper jumped out of that plane.

I'm still questioning the life choices that led me here.
