"My first ticket of the day: ""Computer has data on the screen. Please fix!""


I'm not entirely sure what they're expecting to see on the screen if not data, and when I remoted in everything looked normal, just a Windows workstation sitting at the desktop and when I asked her to explain or show me what she meant, she just said, ""Look! There's data that shouldn't be there!""

&amp;#x200B;

It's a remote session, not a video call, so I can't see what she's pointing at and remind her of that and she starts moving the mouse and hovering over various random icons on the desktop.

&amp;#x200B;

""...do you not want those icons there?""

&amp;#x200B;

""There shouldn't be ANY data on the screen!""

&amp;#x200B;

Don't have the time or patience to explain that if she wants no data on the screen she'll need to turn the monitor or computer completely off, but we also can't delete things without explicit, detailed-as-to-what-is-being-deleted-info, permission from the user.

&amp;#x200B;

I think maybe she's one of those users who didn't have desktop icons showing and she just wants them turned off at this point, so I show her that option and get the desktop looking nice and blank and get, ""No! I need my files, I just don't want to see data on the screen!""

&amp;#x200B;

At this point, there is nothing. on. the. screen. It's just a blank black background. No icons,  no task bar (it was on auto hide), no pictures, no background, no programs open, it's just a blank black screen.

&amp;#x200B;

I tell her she needs to be a little more specific by what she means here as, at the moment, there is literally nothing on the screen, she's still telling me there's ""data on the screen"" that she doesn't want there, and the only way to have data in general not display at all is to turn the computer or monitor completely off.

&amp;#x200B;

This is where I get to the point that I'm tier 3, one step below the engineers, and she's had this same conversation with two levels of support below me and none of them could figure out what on earth she was asking for either.

&amp;#x200B;

She goes off on how it's ""very simple"" she just ""doesn't want any data showing on the screen"" and can't figure out why we can't understand that and says she wants to be escalated to get ""someone who knows what they're doing"". Fine. I send it on up the level to engineering and give them a nice, long warning about the weirdness they're about to encounter.

&amp;#x200B;

They're in the same room, and easy to overhear, and I can currently overhear one of our senior engineers having almost the exact same conversation with her; nobody can figure out what she wants, she can't explain what she wants, nobody at their site can explain it either beyond ""we don't want data displaying on the screen"" and it's honestly one of the most baffling conversations I've had in ages. 

&amp;#x200B;

Usually I can parse weird user statements like that into what they're actually asking, but she managed to stump me.

&amp;#x200B;

It's the same site that calls computers ""modems"" and corrects us every time we call computers computers though, so I'm not entirely surprised."
