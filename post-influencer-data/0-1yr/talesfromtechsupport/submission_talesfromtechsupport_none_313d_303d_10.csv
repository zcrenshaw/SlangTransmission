"The wrong sort of bugs


[After performing duties outside of the scope of nromal IT yesterday](https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/9v719y/now_i_fix_doors_as_well_as_windows/) I've been going deeper down the tech support rabbit hole wondering where it will end.

It's 4:45PM Friday afternoon, and I'm trying to finish off cleaning up the data ready for Mondays phone deployment.  I've been fending off all sorts of idiots during the day, and have been hoping to get out of here on time.  Not many people left here, most of the staff have cleared off home early.

I was trying to contact some new user from one of our branches who has been leaving voicemails for me all day without leaving his phone number or details as to what branch he is at, when I was cornered by one of the office staff armed with a can of insect spray. She babbled something about an ant problem at the other side of the building.

I told her to call the facilities manager, but the bug spray seemed to be affecting her as she didn't have a clue on what to do.  Sighing, I got up and took a walk over to the other side of the office to see what was happening.

I walked in on an Ant Armegeddon.

One office wall was covered in ants on both sides.  She said she's been getting ants on her desk every morning, and she's decided to follow the trail to see where they were coming from.  She followed them to this wall.  She started spraying, at which point the ants came pouring out of the wall.

All I could suggest was to empty the bug spray can into these two offices and close the door.  I messaged the facilities manager to organise a pest controller to come out and have a look at it.  She said she'll organise it for Monday, I took some photos and messaged them to her.  She's organsing someone to come out Saturday morning now.

I then sat back down at my desk to type this story up when my eye caught the logo I printed up and stuck on the back of my laptop over the manufacturers logo.  It says ""Anthill Inside: Pratchett Processor"""
