"Remote that doesn't work when wife is home


I was working for a TV distributor with both cable and dish channels. They had their own brand of TV box/decoders.

When the customer in question called in and started by saying that I had to believe him, I knew it was going to be a great call. The log showed he had called several times before.

Customer: When my wife is at home, the remote control to the decoder doesn't work.

Me: Yes, it does, but I'll hear you out.

Inner Me: I bet she takes the batteries.

Customer: Your colleagues all guessed that she takes the batteries..

Inner Me: Darn it.

Customer: ..but she doesn't! I can be holding the remote control and it works fine. She comes home and ten minutes later it doesn't work any more. I haven't let go of the control, and even tried changing batteries when it stopped working just to be sure, but it doesn't make a difference.

We go back and forth for a long time, thinking of different things that could be an issue. He's being nice about my inability to help him, and though I started out thinking he's just another customer who thinks that the reply to ""Did you check if the cable is connected properly?"" is always ""Yes, I did, I even tried five different cables."", even though they didn't, I quickly realise he's tech-savvy and we discard a dozen theories.

In the end, we solved it.

When his wife got home, she pulled the cartains apart to let in light, and the sunlight was directly on the IR reciever, interfering with the remote control. When his wife left, he pulled the curtains to see the TV better. They'd tried to lower production cost of the new line of decoders, so the dark plastic in front of the IR reciever was just that - dark plastic instead of a filter to block other light. Figuring that out was the most satisfying tech support moment I've had."
