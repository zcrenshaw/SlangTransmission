"How I learned that you can brick iPads by cheating on popular apps.


Ok, I'll try to keep this one short. It's a story I've been meaning to tell to you guys for a while now. It's not *technically* tech support, so if it doesn't fit this sub please let me know.  

I used to work for a fairly large tech retail chain in the Netherlands like 3 - 4 years ago. We sold tablets, laptops, smartphones, stuff like that, also Apple products. It was a quiet afternoon, weekday, so not much to do but stand around and watch wacky videos on our 4k iMacs.  

Cue a dad walking in with his I think about 10-years-old son. They approached me and politely asked for help.  

&gt; Dad: ""Tell the nice man what happened.""  
&gt; Kid: ""Everytime I try to launch an app on my iPad it just goes back to the home screen.""  
&gt; Me: ""Hmm, that's odd. I can look into it for you but please note that we do charge a fee of â‚¬25,- for service if it turns out to take longer than a few minutes.""  
&gt; Dad: ""Ok, sure. Just fix it please.""  

My boss was in the store as well, so I told him I'd be busy with this customer and started looking into what the issue could be. The kid was right. Every time you tried to start an app or even get into the settings menu or whatever, the iPad would instantly close the app and return to the home screen. There was no visible damage to the device. It even had one of those huge foam covers around it.  

&gt; Me: ""Well, I can't see what's causing your issue right now. I'll go into the back and see what we can do for you. Please wait here.""
&gt; Dad: ""Ok, do you think it's serious?""
&gt; Me: ""Don't know yet, but if it turns out to be serious there is not much we can do, we can send it to a repair company for you but they'll just send it back unrepaired since it's probably a software issue.""  
&gt; Dad: ""Damn, well ok. Have a look then.""  

I took the iPad to the back. First order of business was, af course: Google the problem. Lo and behold: one of the first results I found was a page explaining how some kid had bricked his iPad trying to cheat a popular app about crushing various colours of candy. Turns out that by not starting the app for a while, you could get points you needed to buy lives and stuff. By reverting the years on the device way back, waiting for the battery to die, and then restarting your device and putting it on the current date and time you could trick the app into giving you a whole heap of points because it thought you hadn't launched it in years. Turns out this kid tried to take that cheat to max level and reverted his iPad to the earliest possible date; Jan 1st, 1970 - causing the infamous 1970 iPad bug.  

I returned to the store to find the dad and kid impatiently waiting for me.  

&gt;Dad: ""Did you fix it?""  
&gt;Me: ""Well, no, I can't. I'm very sorry. But I think I do know what caused the problem.""  
&gt;Dad: ""Well then, what is it?""  
&gt;Me, turning to kid: ""Do you play [popular app]?""  
&gt;Kid, realising he's busted: ""...yes.""  
&gt;Me: ""And did you try to *cheat* the app?""  
&gt;Kid: ""...yes.""  
&gt;Me, turning to dad: ""He reverted the date on your device to 1970, causing the iPad software to break. Depleting the battery completely might fix the problem. If it doesn't, you'll need to bring it to an official Apple store to see if they can fix it."" (side note: there's only a handful of those in the Netherlands, many of them far away from our little town.)  
&gt;Dad, turning to kid: ""[insert angry Turkish yelling at kid]""
&gt;Me: ""Sir, I'm sorry but I'll have to charge the service fee.""  
&gt;Dad: ""THIS IS COMING OUT OF YOUR ALLOWANCE, [SON NAME]! YOU WON'T BE SEEING THAT IPAD FOR WEEKS!""  

They leave the store after paying the fee, the dad still angrily mumbling to the son, never to be seen again. My boss gives me the side-eye, I explain what happens. We both have a good laugh about it for a few minutes and go about our work."
