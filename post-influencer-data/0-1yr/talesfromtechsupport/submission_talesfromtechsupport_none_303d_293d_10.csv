"Did you logout?


Here's a quickie but I'm sure you'll all recognise it from at least one call.

This has happened a few times this week. I'm actually astounded by how often is happens.

Customer calls in and says ""Hey I need you to fix this problem for me."" Of course the problem requires remote assistance to fix.

Me: Ok I'll need you to log out so I can remote into the background and delete part of your roaming profile so we can attempt to resync you.

Customer: Ok it's done!

Me: Ok. *Attempts to start remote assistance* ok for some reason it's not working. It says your computer may be powered off..... Did you log out or....

Customer: Yeah it's just finishing shut down now.

Me: **Head Desk**
