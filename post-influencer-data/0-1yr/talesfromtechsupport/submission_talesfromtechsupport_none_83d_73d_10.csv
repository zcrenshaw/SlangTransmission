"The literal job I was hired for at my university is pressing the ok button on the printer when it is “broken”.


I get paid $12 an hour to sit at a desk in the library all day just so tech support doesn’t have to deal with non existent problems from students and staff. I call it the common sense desk because every question I get is DUMB. 

My primary interactions are...
Student or prof:  “the printer is broken” 

Me: *goes to printer* 

Printer: “confirm print job?”

Me: *presses ok*

Printer: *prints*


I also would like to note that there is a sign on the printer that says “press ‘ok’ to print”. 

I think it’s kind of hilarious and deeply sad that IT had to hire someone for this position from 6 in the morning to 2am. But boy oh boy do I have an endless amount of tales."
