"""You uh, you sound a little drunk.""


So background for this one, I worked at what is essentially help desk for senior citizens. People call in, I fix their shit however I can. I worked from home, so I had a bit of leeway. At the time the company was trying to starve my team out (We got paid per ticket) and so they were giving us minimal tickets.

$ME: Me

&amp;#x200B;

$UX: Other guy

&amp;#x200B;

I was fresh into hour 9 of my shift and at this point it's a Thursday night. I decide to call a few friends and get them to come over and have a small kick back. Surprisingly I get 4 people over in the next few minutes so I decide to put on a pair of pants and begin my night. I look at the clock. 45 minutes of taking calls left. I've had two tickets today. That's $20. I decide, fuck it. I'm drinking early. I don't give a shit for $20 for 10 hours of being chained to my room. 6 or 8 shots later I get a phone call. Oh fuck it's work. Let's see what time it is. \_10:58\_ Fuck, two minutes before my shift is over.

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt;$ME: ""Hello, thank you for calling \[redacted\], how can I help you?

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt;$UX: ""Hi, I'm having issues with my printer.""

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt;$ME: ""Oh ok, what seems to be going on?""

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt;$UX: ""It isn't letting me print, it says the printer is offline.""

&amp;#x200B;

Printer. Shit, this can go one of two ways, but I have a good feeling on this one.

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt;$ME: ""Can I get you to uhhh turn off your printer please?""

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt;$UX: ""How do I do that?""

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt;$ME: ""Eh, just unplug the thing."" (This I learned was easier with clients at this company and I'm starting to feel the vodka, it's not worth troubleshooting.)

\&gt;$UX: ""Sure thing.""

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt;$ME: ""Now plug it back in and turn it on.""

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt;$UX: ""Ok, I did that. You sound a little bit drunk by the way.""

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt;$ME: ""Sigggghhhh. It's a speech impediment.""

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt;$UX: ""Oh my god, I'm so sorry, I didn-""

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt;$ME: ""It's fine I get it all the time. Now try printing. Does it work?""

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt;$UX: ""It works, so sorry I didn't mean to offend you.""

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt;$ME: ""You're fine sir, I get it all the time. Have a nice day."" \_Click\_

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt;$ME: ""Alright guys, who's ready for Wizard Staff?""
