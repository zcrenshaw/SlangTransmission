"Thank you /r/asknyc for the advice! My first NYC trip was great!


I'm a 42 year married father of two teenage daughters from South Georgia who wanted to check a visit to Manhattan off my bucket list and with your help, I didn't fall victim to scammers and hustlers. We stayed at Kimpton Ink 48 on 11th Ave. because we have two dogs and they're great about pets. The view from The Press Room Lounge on the 16th floor is amazing. Loved people watching out our window which was facing Stage 48 and another couple of clubs.

Because of your advice I was able to easily spot the ""official looking"" barkers trying to get me to buy tickets to the Statue of Liberty when I got near the Staten Island Ferry and easily waved them off. Same thing in Times Square with people trying to hand me things. Was able to toss up a hand and then ignore them to show them I wasn't having none of their pushy sales tactics. 

Took uber all around the city and and was able to confirm the following: The traffic is truly horrible at times. Half of my uber drivers were insane and never hesitated to blow their horn and nearly run people over and/or ram other vehicles. Shake Shack does in fact have the best burger I've eaten so far. Joe's Pizza on Carmine St. and Sal's Pizza on 10th Ave. are both fantastic pizza and better than any garbage I've had in South Georgia. The 9/11 Memorial left me awestruck. To be standing where all those lives were lost is really humbling. Times Square at night was overwhelming to the senses. The lights, the smells, the sounds, the people; it's quite a lot. I refused to goto NYC without riding the subway. I rode from the Staten Island Ferry to Broadway and that section wasn't so bad as I've heard it can be. But at least now I can say I've ridden the NYC subway. 

There is so much more to say about your city. It is truly amazing. I'm not sure I'll ever get to visit again but I'm so very glad I got to come once. Thank you again for the wealth of knowledge this sub has and how invaluable it was to my visit. God bless."
"A huge cockroach ran across my pillow last night and now I'm afraid to go to bed, help me


I occasionally have nights where I don't sleep much at all for no discernable reason. Last night was one of those nights. Around 4 AM, I was minding my own business, trying to sleep, and then I felt something. I immediately sat up and saw a giant fucking cockroach run across my pillow and off the edge of the bed. I, of course, completely lost my shit. I tried to tell myself the shadow made it look bigger than it was, or perhaps I was delusional from lack of sleep and imagined it, but then I saw it on the wall and this mofo was like three inches long. I'm not opposed to smashing the occasional German cockroach but I couldn't bring myself to touch this behemoth so instead I accidentally woke my husband up with all of my carrying on. He didn't seem concerned about our monster bug invader. 

I basically spent the next two hours sitting upright, staring at the wall and reading a book on my phone until the sun started to come up and I figured I was safe. 

I bought some bait traps at Duane Reade that are set up around my bed like some sort of pagan ritual circle and used like a whole tube of Advion to create what I hope is a protective barrier. My 36-count pack of glue traps will be here tomorrow. I also had a stern talking-to with my cat about his bug-killing responsibilities. 

Besides getting really drunk before I go to bed, is there anything else I can do to reduce my chances of seeing this asshole again? Sleep with the lights on? Burn my whole apartment down?"
"My super just told us we can't flush toilet paper down the toilet - is this legal?


As the title says, the super just informed us that we shouldn't be flushing toilet paper, but rather trashing it because it's causing a clog. We clarified that he did indeed mean TP and not tampos/pads/paper towel. That sounds to me like it's below a basic standard of habitability. Is there a law I can use to force my landlord to fix the toilet or reduce my rent?"
"Is this legal? Potential tenants given keys to tour and coming in unsupervised.


I'm not sure if this is standard practice, so I apologize if this post comes off naive (which I fully admit that I am in this topic). This is my second year in NYC, but my first year was in a dorm, so this is my first year as a renter. My lease is up at the end of August. I've been having people come into my place, first was a woman who only asked to take pictures of the unit (I assumed she worked for the building, but in hindsight, probably not). Second, I assumed was a broker and a potential tenant, but could've just been 2 women touring the apartment together (2 bdroom). All of these have been without notice. 

I'm cleaning my apartment today, when I hear someone trying keys on my door. I freak out a little bit, as there was no knock or anything, but I had the chain lock on. Finally they get the door open, and I go over and speak to the woman through the crack (admittedly really rudely- I assumed she worked for the building) asking her why she wouldn't knock or notify me she needed to get into my apartment. She says she's only there to tour the apartment for September 1st move in, and that the building gave her keys (I apologized profusely- it's not her fault). 

Now I'm freaked out. I work 5 days a week, 12-7, so hours the unit would probably be toured. When I toured the place a year ago, not only was it vacant, but someone from the building management was present the entire time. I'm worried about complete strangers being given keys to get into my apartment, one which is very much occupied, and being able to tour when I'm not there, completely unsupervised. I'm a 21 year old, 95 pound girl who lives alone too- maybe it sounds paranoid, but I'm worried about men touring alone while I'm here as well.. this doesn't seem legal, and do I have a right to at least complain to building management?"
"Landlord is trying to charge us $1,200 to paint our apartment. Now I'm seeing they're required to paint every 3 years. Advice?


We just moved out (lease is up Jul 31st), and have lived in this unit exactly 3 years.  We cleaned &amp; spackled our apartment as I've always known to be the standard, but our landlord emailed us yesterday livid that we didn't repaint the apartment's walls after spackling. He told us we can either come repaint it ourselves, or he's going to take $1,200 from our security deposit to pay someone to do so. I'm now finding laws online stating that landlords are required to repaint the walls of their units once every 3 years -- anyone been in this situation before?  Are we able to take action or does this 3 year rule become moot because we are moving out right at the cutoff? We don't have time or resources to repaint before the 31st and we would really love to not lose $1,200. Big thanks for any advice."
