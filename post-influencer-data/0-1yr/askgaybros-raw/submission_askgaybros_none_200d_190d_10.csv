0,"I’m not reading one more thread about being in love with a straight guy


All the single lonely gay men out there and here you are wetting your briefs over straight guys? What the fuck does it take get queens to accept that these straight muthafuckas do not like dick in any form? They don’t like it in your mouth, in their mouth, in your ass, or in their ass. They are straight. Often they have girlfriends who are taking their load every night. Seriously, enough already. I have no interest in straight men or what they’re doing. Done"
1,"I came out to my frat bros yesterday...


And today for dinner the menu was: meat lovers pizza, grilled asparagus and mushroom (ASSparagus), and bananas, which they all deep throated lmao. 

Get yourselves good friends bros. It makes things so much better. "
2,"Kissed my first guy last night


I went out to bars with two of my best buds. We drank a bit and I was feeling good. Decided that tonight was the night. My two friends, bless them, told me to say fuck it and go for it. 

I went out to the dance floor and started looking around. Then I saw this one dude. Tall and handsome as fuck. I went up to him and we started talking. Conversation was cool, talked about school and what we're studying. Then he asked me if he could kiss me.

You know ya boy did and let me tell y'all, that shit was incredible. I've never felt my heart beat so fast. I had to fan myself, I felt like some damsel. 

My hearts pounding just thinking about it.

3,"The guy from my yoga class just blew me in the locker room


A lot of bros PM’d me after my last post to give an update if I ever hook up with the guy from my yoga class again.

So a few weeks ago I posted here for some advice about getting head from a guy for the first time. Upon the recommendations I received here, I informed my girlfriend that I wanted to do it (got her full and supportively horny permission) and then made it known to the guy in my yoga class I was interested, he picked up on it, we went back to his place and it was awesome. 

We’ve seen each other a few times since then at the yoga studio. Mostly light chit chat with a little flirting here and there, nothing heavy. 

Fast forward to this morning, 8:00am power vinyasa flow class and as usual, we are the only men in the class. After class, we were both showering and he finished first. When I came out of my shower stall, he was shirtless, but had his jeans on. I took my towel off to get changed while we were talking. Next thing I know, he reached over and softly grabbed my cock. I instantly got rock hard and with no words spoken, he went down on it. There was another class coming up at 9:30 and I was concerned that someone was going to come in and catch us. The thought of getting caught was thrilling. I came pretty quickly and it was fantastic. This guy gives the best head I’ve ever had. Can’t wait until the next time!

I guess I’m officially bi now and I have no problem with it."
4,"I'm really proud of myself.


The other day, I saw a really cute guy across from me in the dining hall. I spent all the time I was there stealing glances at him. When I was leaving, I gathered up enough courage to ask him out. He turned out to be straight, but I was prepared for that. A few minutes later I ran into a bathroom, crying. I was so happy. I'm comfortable enough with my sexuality now that getting rejected by a straight guy is not worse than getting rejected by a gay guy.

That is all. "
5,"I called out a middle aged straight guy and he apologised. Small win?


I work in a male dominant industry and there’s very little diversity. So I wasn’t surprised to hear a guy at work was “confused” by the different gender definitions and characteristics people use to identify. What began to annoy me was how vocal and hateful his comments were getting.

I decided to get involved in the conversation when he began to say society is pandering to minorities and this never existed X years ago etc. I basically told him;

- Genders are more recognised now than ever and there’s nothing wrong with that. It’s inclusive. 
- Sex (anatomically and assigned at birth), gender and sexuality are different.
- I explained the differences. 
- Lastly, he shouldn’t be concerned or angry with how someone else identifies. If someone tells him how they would like to be addressed he should respect that. They are human and deserve to be treated as equals.

At the time he was obviously in disagreement with me so I told him to think about it and we’d discuss it again another time. 

Fast forward and today he actually apologised and thanked me for being so patient about everything. It actually made me happy for him because I don’t think anyone had ever actually laid it out that way before.

Anyone else have similar success after explaining things to people?

7,"Growing up gay has suppressed my personality?


I feel like growing up I forced myself to internalize a lot of my feelings to hide the fact i was gay and it feels like a switch I can’t really turn off... Like I remember in high school I felt like I could never be “one of the guys” because I basically recoiled in fear of giving myself away every time a guy friend tried to show some kind of physical affection to me.  I was a very outgoing, and funny person when I was younger but once i started to become more self aware of who I was I became very quiet, less funny, and generally depressing... to this day I feel like no emotion I feel is genuine and that I’m constantly stuck in this mode of trying to hide something from the world even though I have nothing to hide anymore (openly gay now) :/. Flirting is impossible for me.... anyone else experience this?"
8,"A message for YOU.


You're hot.

You're one hot motherfucker and YOU KNOW IT.

You know when you get that ideal body, that degree, whatever the fuck it is you want, you're gonna be even fucking hotter.

And you know you have what it takes. YES YOU FUCKING DO. Nothing is impossible for you.

Because you're THE SHIT.

&amp;#x200B;

Doesn't matter where you are, how old you are, what you look like.

The only thing that matters is the future ahead of you.

And that future is yours to make anything happen. 

Wanna become a better person? Do it. Wanna thrive in your career? Do it. Wanna fix your awful personality? Do it.

Get that grind. Get it. Because nothing is gonna happen if you keep sitting on your hands.

&amp;#x200B;

Forget about regrets. Forget about tomorrows. The only thing that matters is now.

Get up and get moving. Get started. Be whoever the fuck you want to be and don't care about what others think.

Because your mind, your soul, and your light, isn't here to make them comfortable.

It's here for you to shine."
9,"PSA: Please for the love of all fuck clean your house/apartment/room before a hookup.


I’m not saying you should go all out and make the place spotless, but is it too much to ask that you pick up the trash and light a candle or something to cover up the smell of your cat’s litter box?


This was inspired by the guy I hung out with today whose apartment smelled like 50 layers of cat piss were sprayed onto every available surface. Didn’t even get naked from how turned off I was.

Please, please, plllllease clean up/freshen your place up a little before you invite someone who wants to stay attracted to you."
10,"Do you also struggle to pee in a public urinal if there's other men peeing beside you?


I've suffered from this stupid reflex since I was a kid. 

I've read that if you close your mind and count to ten it helps, but the anxiety is too strong. "
11,"My father is deathly ill and my family take this chance to force me into ""renouncing the gay""


A little back story, I'm a Vietnamese, i live with my. family cause that's what we kinda do, i guess. But last year i decided to come out, at 27,  to a mixed to negative outcome. But they were tolerating it I guess, with the hope that I'll change my mind after 2 or 3 years of fooling around. 

Back to the present, my father is hospitalized, in a coma with 15% of surviving, so my family (mother, sister, relatives and all) decided that it's  a good time to talk to me about marrying and having kids. With the argument that who's gonna take care of you when you're old and sick like that blah blah.. My mother even use death to threaten  me.. I'm taking my stand about this, but with this and taking care of my father it's fucking tiring... 

Any advices to navigate this mine fields?
Moving out is not an option. "
12,"An amazing kiss is better than sex


Whilst I love sex and have had many really hot situations, making out with someone who you have a great chemistry with cannot be beaten. I can and have made out for hours with some guys. With one guy, we made out for 3 hours in his car and didn't realise that we lasted so long until I saw the time and realised I needed to go to sleep."
13,"Being the gay twin. I'm in a kinda unique situation


I'm 17. We're identical twins btw. My brother has been dating since the 5th grade. I can think of at least 8 girls he's dated. Could be more and I just can't remember. I've sadly have walked in on sexual acts before. We shared a room until we were 16 so yeah. My brother is the only one who actually knows i'm gay. Many at school assume it. Sometimes kids will drop hints about it and stuff like that. I think a big reason that people assume i'm gay is the fact i've never had a girlfriend. I've had girls come up to me and tell me there friend likes me and stuff like that. The more annoying thing is when guys will mention it. For example a couple weeks ago in the locker room. A guy asked me why I never had a gf. Bringing up the focusing on school excuse doesn't work because i'm not a good student. And right on cue he mentioned that my brother has a gf. And then he asked if I was ""gay or something"". This instance was actually more extreme and a little sexist. Because he mentioned that he can think of a few girls right off hand who'd be willing to blow me or ""put out"" as he put it. Without wanting to date. So that time it got sexist. But i've had guys ask me for years why i'm not dating when my brother is. I'm kinda a jock. I use the gym at school daily. And i've had people ask me why i'm working out if i'm not trying to get a gf. Wanting to be healthy and feel good isn't enough it seems. This stuff happens often enough that it kinda worries me. I've not had anyone bully me yet but they seem obsess with it. 

&amp;#x200B;

And my brother has told me that people asks him if i'm gay every once in a while. He says that he try to shut them up the best he can. Pretty much every time someone try to say i'm gay. They compare me to my brother. With the fact I don't like to be compare to him in the first place. It's just really annoying. My brother suggest I just come out. The way I look at it. If they're this annoying now. I don't wanna know how annoying they'd be if i'm out. 

&amp;#x200B;"
14,"Coming out has brought my brother and I closer together. We hugged for possibly the first time


Hey it's me again, the gay twin. I just wan't to say thank you for all the kind comments on the posts. And of course thank you for the motivation. You can read the post on my profile if you want to get caught up. Pretty much Friday afternoon I came out via instagram. Been out for going on two full days! So my brother and I are twins. He's straight which confirmation that  inferring. But that's aside the point. In the first two post I made brother sound really cool. And he is. Before Friday he was the only one who knew I was gay and he had my back. But we're still brother so we're dicks to each other constantly. We never really had that special twin bond. We act more like normal brothers and thus fight constantly. I feel part of it has to do with sharing a room until we were 16. We're currently 17 and we get along much better than we use to. We were at each others throats when we shared a room. Pretty much only time we could get along was while playing a video game and it we were liable to start fighting. But as I said he has my back in this gay thing. And that was made very apparent on Friday night. We were up until 2 am playing video games and keeping a eye on the coming out post. Most of the reaction have been positive and very nice. There was one comment from a guy that said ""Nobody could've ever predicted this! It's not like the jeans you wear that look like you're trying to crush your balls outta exsistance gave it away. Not even the colorful shirts that make you look like a fairy gave it away. nope complete shock!"". I wasn't too concern about it. I don't like the guy much anyways. idk why he was following me. So I blocked him.

My brother on the other hand. Wasn't amused. He was legit pissed. I was surprised with how legit piss he was. I had to tell him to hold his horses. And what happened next still has me shocked. I get up from the computer chair and make my way to the bathroom and my brother got in front of me and gave me a bloody hug. I can't think of us ever hugging before, even a forced hug. It scared me tbh. I thought he had to be fucking with me and was gonna knee me in the balls or something. We've not mentioned that hug since. After the hug we wen't back to doing what we were doing. Aside from Friday night. We've been getting along great all together. We spent most of the day yesterday hanging out. Got together with some friends too. They're very supportive as well. So while i'm scared about school on Monday. I feel better with all of them around me.

I don't think I can make it clear how amazing this is. I can tell probably hundred of stories of us being dicks to each other. Us getting along for at the very least this long is groundbreaking. I mean we're still making jokes about each other and giving the other shit. But we aren't flat out insulting like we usually do. I feel like this won't last but if we can at least get along a little better. I'd call it a success. Well that's all. This will probably be the last post.I don't wanna seem like i'm milking it. Once again thank you everyone!"

18,"Hi it's me the gay twin. Update from my post from yesterday. I came out


https://www.reddit.com/r/askgaybros/comments/avlvre/being_the_gay_twin_im_in_a_kinda_unique_situation/

Here's the original post. I don't feel like summing it up. I wasn't expecting that many comments. I wasn't really seeking advice. I just wanted to rant about how annoying these kids are. And show how stupid they're being.I didn't really want to come out. Maybe to my friends at least but  not to everyone. The comments were recommending I come out. People made some great points. People saying they regret hiding it so long really spoke to me. But it was one comment that convinced me A person said that they didn't like how people were giving me reasons why I should come out. They said ""You don't need a reason to not lie about yourself"". It's a simple sentence that you'd expect from a coming out age gay movie or book or whatever. But for some reason it really got me. And I decided I wanted to come out. And around the same time. A way to do it that I liked popped into my head. So I posted my thought process behind it and how I came out and the reaction on the lgbt forum on my main account. This is a throwaway one for me to complain about stuff with lol. So read below if you want. But let me just say thank you everyone. I was not expecting that reaction and tbh it annoyed me a little at first but as I said that one comment got me. So thank you once again everyone. 



""So my brother was the only one who knew I was gay. So first I talked to him. Some people were saying that if I came out. Some people might assume that one twin being gay the other must be. And some might assume he's just been fucking girls trying hide it. That never occurred to me. Another thing to worry about thing! So I talked to my brother about it and he didn't really care about anyone saying that. And all in all he said go for it if I wanted to. Said he would have my back but also said he'll have to start making gay jokes about me in public instead of just in private. He wanted me to know that lol. And secondly I told our friends. I figured with how I was planning to come out I didn't want them to be surprise or angry I didn't tell them first. So got group text up and told them i'm gay. And i'm kinda offended because they weren't that surprise. A couple of them said they kinda figured. But I haven't exactly been good at keeping in the closet. Like my brother had to tell me that my followers can see what posts I like on instagram.....ops. Ok so now my friends knew so I was ready for my plan. I ran it by everyone and they liked it so I wen't ahead and did it.

So since for years people have tried to set me up with girls. Hell my brother would do that constantly before he knew. I wanted to do something that would be a ""sorry ladies I like penis"" type of thing. So I made a instagram of me in a sleeveless compression shirt and compression shorts in the process of lifting some dumbbells, along with flexing as much as I could. I wanted to show off my body. I'm not super rip or anything like that. In the process of cutting right now after bulking for several months. But i'm pretty toned and you can tell I have muscle. I don't work out and eat clean just for the health benefits. I wanted to show off my body with it being nsfw. I'm kinda worry that the picture makes me look like a douche bag that's full of myself. But the point is to show that I don't want girls I guys. So here a good pic of me for any gay guys out there. So I took the picture of me and I posted in on Instagram. With the caption ""Seriously everyone. I'M GAY, stop trying to hook me up with girls. Send guys my way tho"". And so I posted it after school. I wanted to wait until Friday so we would have the weekend to hopefully make it not the top thing. My brother was the first one to comment. We thought it would be smart for him to say something so everyone would assume he didn't know and annoy him. He refuse to tell me what he was gonna say so I was kinda scared. He just said ""I love you gay brother!"".

And so yeah it's been a couple hours now and everything seems to be find. The first comment was a girl who said ""damn"". Not sure if it was toward the pic or what. Quite a few have complimented the pic without commenting on the gay part. I guess I should start dressing in tighter and less clothing. There's been many saying ""I knew it, called it, not surprising"" stuff like that. And many comments being supportive and no comment with anyone being mean. One person said that she wanted to hear stories about one twin being straight and one being gay. She said that she bets they're many stories. And of course some people have asked if i'm a top or bottom.They're assuming bottom which is pretty rude if you ask me. True but rude. And people are making gay jokes. But so far at least everything seems to be ok. I think the real test will be school on Monday. And oh yeah I should probably tell my mom."""
