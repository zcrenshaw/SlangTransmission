0,"Talked to a gay dude for the first time


Currently I'm in uni and I have this presentation I have to do with this group. Theres a guy that looks gay but cute asf, we made a whatsaapp group but since im really trying to break from shell since accepting myself I made a new chat with me and him to ask him questions about what we gonna do, we talked etc

Yesterday we saw each other in the library, and we kept talking and talking and it was pretty late and there were empty halls. After minutes of talking we talked about gay stuff because I told him I was too, when it was late I jist asked him if we can go out, he smiled and said yes. 

Lmao all these years repressing my sexuality and honestly it felt great to finally get over that fear man, It mights be small for many here but for a dude who hated himself a year back for being gay, asking a gay dude out was liberating."
1,"I went to hook up with a guy and we ended up just cuddling and talking the whole time


We were naked, we kissed some, and touched each other‚Äôs junk a little, but man, he was just so interesting to talk to, we ended up talking for three hours. This isn‚Äôt how hookups usually go. I was worried he was disappointed and just being nice but he wants to get together again! Anyway, something out of the ordinary and it‚Äôs a breath of fresh air."
2,"This is a very sad but also very beautiful story. I am in a process of healing and I want to share my story with you guys


I was born in a conservative place. It was hard growing up. It was painful around the homophobia. Just when I had lost all hope and thought I was sick and unnatural I met him. Mickey. 


We were classmates in highschool. Damn I fell hard üòÇ but as it turns out so did he. We were only 15. But we felt like we owned the world. We made love, we drew paintings, we danced under the stars, we were all we needed. We swore to be together. Always. He made us rings and we put them and promised to each other. It didn't matter if our families accepted us or no. Once we finished school we moved away from our hateful families.




We lived in a cozy studio in the outskirts of a big town. It was small, it was cheap, but it was all we needed. He got a job at a store and at a nightclub and literally supported me through University. Then it was my turn. I worked and suppported us both while he got his degree. Then as some years passed we moved to a bigger apartment. It was so amazing. I felt us building beauty and future together. Just us. Against everyone. Against everything. Against hate. Only our love. It fought through everything. Our ignorent families that threw us on the street, the hateful society that told us we were unnatural.



These were the most amazing and unforgettable years of my life. We were the supreme duo. I am 39 years old now.


Mickey died last year. In fall. On this day. His favourite season to portray with his unbelievable art talent. His favourite time of the year. He left. And now he is an angel. An angel in the sky. That watches over me. You may not believe that but I know it for a fact. Is it hard? I cry myself to sleep every night. But he was such a vibrant soul, I still feel his presence here, I still feel him, I still talk to him. 


I am sad. I miss him heavily. The pain is so strong it's unreal. But what he left me, all the love, all the self respect he taught me, he made me the person I am. I and his paintings are his legacy on this earth. I know that we will be reunited one day. Until then all I can do is live, honoring his life with every breath I take. I am crying as I write this.




I LOVE YOU MICKEY ‚ù§"
3,"Came out to my parents after my basic military training graduation-they don‚Äôt believe me


I came out to my parents the day after I graduated basic training. 
What prompted me to do it was that my parents aren‚Äôt supporting me anymore and the guys who I went through basic with were very accepting of it. I‚Äôve never been in an environment where so many ‚Äútough‚Äù males were respectful regarding gay people. In high school, the ‚Äúcool, popular jocks‚Äù were always homophobic and ignorant.
After I told my parents, they looked at me and asked if I was joking and I said no. My brother is gay too, you can reference my post history for that scenario. So after some awkward silence I just go to say that I understand where they are coming from but I‚Äôm not joking.
My father was much more accepting of it than my mom, who was being very dramatic about it. (Ie putting her face in her hands and shaking her head).
I don‚Äôt have a question, I just wanted to share that after doing that I feel less angry all the time, regardless of their reaction. I used to be mad around my family and now I‚Äôm not."

5,"ProTip: If you casually hookup, just assume everyone is HIV+ and apply your ""If he's HIV+"" policy to every guy.


Do you casually hookup? What if he's HIV+? Do you have different policies for HIV+ and neg guys? You shouldn't. Just assume ALL guys are HIV+ and apply your policy?

If you somehow *knew* the other guy is HIV+...

* Would you not hookup? Don't hookup with anyone, then.

* You would hookup, but only with a condom? Use a condom with EVERY guy then.

* You're good because you're on PrEP? You're good with any guy then.

Honestly, the *worst* policy is the following:

&gt; I'll bareback if you're neg. Are you neg?

That's pretty much the only self-destructive and stupid policy. 

Because there's only one major constant in the gay hookup scene:

&gt; Men lie.

Also, these truths:

&gt; HIV+ Undetectable men, at least cannot transmit it to you

&gt; Most gay men are afraid to get tested because they're afraid of the stigma of HIV.

&gt; Ergo, you can't assume anyone is HIV neg. So assume they're all positive, and carry on.

And honestly, if an HIV+ Undetectable guy then lies and says he's negative, you're technically safer with him than if a guy who thinks he's neg but hasn't been tested in years. Honestly, he's doing *you* a favor, giving you the pity fuck. Gay guys can be so dumb."

7,"[Update] [NSFW] Nerd sex party was great!


I got there to help set up and chatted with the couple other people there. Super nice and super SUPER nerdy dudes, then as time went on more and more people trickled in. We played smash Bros for a little bit and after about an hour everyone was kinda ready to get naked, so clothes pretty quickly came off after that. I sucked and rimmed quite a lot of really cute guys, and got sucked and rimmed by quite a few more. I'm saving fucking for a relationship so that didn't happen to me but more than a few people were fucking on the bed in the other room at various points. Also luckily I met this super adorable nerdy guy who I totally clicked with and we cuddled and made out and felt eachother up for a good part of the night. I got his snap and we're both super into eachother so that might turn into something. I came like 5 times that night and it was everything I could've ever hoped for: just a bunch of cute nerdy dudes doing what comes naturally with eachother, and I got a really cute date out of it. I'll definitely be a regular attendee from now on, as the party is a monthly event.

P.S. if anyone is in the NYC area and is interested in coming to this party in future DM me and I can see about getting you in contact with the host."

9,"Texas just passed a law that makes unsolicited nude photos illegal.... Grindr is in shambles rn


[Here‚Äôs the link](https://www.reddit.com/r/news/comments/cy7282/new_texas_laws_illegal_to_send_unsolicited_nude/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app)

What are the general thoughts on this? My first impressions are that this is a law passed by a bunch of old men who think they‚Äôre doing a good thing, but in reality you can‚Äôt really call every nude sent unsolicited just because the receiving party didn‚Äôt say  ‚Äúsend me a dick pic‚Äù 

On the bright side, maybe it‚Äôll stop those people who send close up anus pics as the first message"
10,"SPOILER If you go to see IT chapter two, be aware


At the very beginning of the film there is a very graphic homophobic attack on a gay couple, it really shook me and was very hard to watch, i just wouldnt want anyone who's ever been the victim of a homophobic attack to go and see the film without being aware. I was nearly in tears, it was horrendous."
11,"Dumped my girlfriend üò≥


Well you guessed it, i dumped my girlfriend.
It happened last night,  before this the last few weeks i have had a huge change of preference lately regarding my sexuality which is something im super new to, and ive been thinking about telling my girlfriend and  i have also been sitting on the fact that she would not like the idea of it at all, but yesterday i texted her to hang out at the mall and maybe get dinner, she said sure as always and we went, when i saw her i gave her hug and she gave me a kiss which made me feel a little guilty knowing what im about to tell her but we carried on and got subway and stuff. I was super hesitant in my mind on if i should  tell her, but after a moment of silence i said "" hey, i need to tell you something important, something that might upset you but its important"" she said ""sure whats up?, i continued to tell her that for some reason i havent been attracted to girls recently, i told her i didnt know why and that it wasnt my preference but its how i felt and i didnt want to lie to her. The first thing she said was ""well.. Okay are you sure?  do you still like me?"" i told her i was confused but sure about what was going on with me, i said that id always love her as a friend but  we should probably take a break to figure it out, as much as i hated saying that i friend zoned her and she didnt take it well but she didnt flip, she hasnt really texted me since last night. I just wanna be sure i did the right thing and  that i didnt take things too far. Any advice would be apreuciated, thanks x"
12,"I told my boyfriend I love him


So yeah, we were cuddling last night and told him that I feel like I love him a little. He smiled at me and told me he had been thinking about that too, which I guess means he loves me as well! 

Just wanted to say this because it's so hard for me to like or to feel comfortable with someone, but I liked him since the very first moment I saw him, and he has been making my life better in so many aspects and I really really needed that kind of support in my life.


So yeah, I can finally say that I've been feeling happy."

14,"Anyone else an introvert, who has trouble with how extroverted gay men are?


I mean, every single dating profile talks about how the guy wants to go out and explore the world and enjoy having fun and whatnot. And I'm just like... sorry, but I don't. 

I'm a very low-energy, quiet, introverted person. I think the low energy may be a health problem, but I can't afford insurance so it'll have to wait until when/if I get it. A 5-hour shift at my job drains all my energy. I just don't have any to begin with. 

I would get messages from total extroverts (because maybe they're attracted to their opposites?), and, thanks but I'm really not interested. 

I have a high level of social anxiety. I'm tired. I don't want to go outside. I don't want to walk around malls and shopping centers (I can't keep spending money anyway). I don't want to go to restaurants (again, money but also I just don't care about food). I don't want to go to bars or clubs- I hate drinking and crowds. I don't want to go to concerts- I'm very sensitive to loud noise. 

I'm just not that type of person. Why don't people understand this? And why can't I find others like myself?

I just want to stay inside and play video games, or watch stuff on YouTube. Whatever. 

I don't wanna keep doing this shit. I wish I had the money to just buy an introverted husband and that's that. 

If I can't find them online, where can I find other homebodies? I looked everywhere."

So my mom found my dildo in my bathroom this morning, She needed something from my bathroom this morning before she went to work and obviously discovered it. She doesn't know that I was awake though and I am trembling with anxiety and fear right now. I am out to her and being gay isn't that big of an issue to her but it's still a horrible feeling.

17,"Dumped by straight friend. Why do you think and what should I do?


My best friend in all the world is a straight guy, hence no sex or romance. We were both only children and became like brothers over a decade. I love him very much. We confided with each other in everything and helped each other through many rough spots. We made each other laugh, had fun all the time, and worked at the same place. Each was always there for the other. For example, he ran to me when he caught his wife cheating. I was with him and advised him the whole time (They worked it out). We have both said we are each other's best friend. Anyway, his wife got a super, unexpected dream-job offer far away and they moved. Suddenly now, without any reason or explanation, he has cut he off completely; total blackout. No communication or responses to my messages whatsoever. It hurts very much. Do you have any guess why? I don't know anything else to do. If there had been any disagreement, it would make sense. This doesn't. He had no issues with my gayness. Thanks!"
18,"fighting internalized homophobia


I grew up in a very conservative place, and I have been very straight acting all my life pretty much. But I felt a sense of urgency to rid of that feeling, that feeling of when a guy you like gets you hard or in locker rooms of my baseball team where I'd have to my cup faster than everyone because I had a boner looking at the rest of the guys. I used bullying, I made every gay person that lived in my life miserable, including myself. i thought that maybe if I was homophobic enough my homosexuality would go away as if sexuality works like ideology. Tried jerking off to women and it doesnt work

I'm 21 now and I feel horrendous for doing those things. I feel miserable knowing I lie to myself and even women, when I struggle to even stay hard with them for the lack of interest in their bodies. I hit up those guys I bullied and apologized to them, met with one of them who lives close by, I came out to him and he said ''we all knew it, we just felt bad for you that you had to hide it, we felt bad that your family was in control of your sexuality'' which hit me deep, I was trying to make people fear me and if anything they thought I was ''sad''. 

Just today I looked at the mirror and said those word I'd hate to hear ''I'm gay''. With it I felt very masculine, more so than before. Now i'm trying to prepare for my other war against my fam. but the war against myself is finally defeated. I'm sorry for homophobic people that made your life shit, many of them we just wanted dick and we were mad you could get some"
