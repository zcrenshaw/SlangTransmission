0,"Gaybros, something that I never in my wildest dreams thought would happen to me happened to me today.


Hi guys,

So I‚Äôm a second year student at my university and all fall semester and now this winter semester I kept seeing this really cute guy all over campus. Like I‚Äôd always see him with his group of friends and think to myself ‚ÄúUgh I wish I knew him or was friends with him‚Äù. Because you can just tell he‚Äôs a really good guy, like a nice guy. He‚Äôs just so cute too and he always wears these tight jeans that accentuate his bubble butt lol üòÇ . But anyways, so I kept seeing him all year and I‚Äôd literally just look at him in his group of friends and smile and wish I was friends with him. But I didn‚Äôt know anyone who was friends with him and so I couldn‚Äôt do anything. But obviously I assumed he was straight so i just forgot about him. Until recent weeks, I noticed everytime I‚Äôd walk by, id see him staring at me. Like he‚Äôd be in the library with his friends talking with them, and I‚Äôd see him staring at me. I was so confused, I didn‚Äôt know why he was staring at me. Like for 2 weeks straight he‚Äôd just stare at me constantly. And the other day, - he actually approached me and spoke to me. I was so fucking nervous and had butterflies. He asked me what my program is and what My name. And we got to know each other and we went to get subway together and on the way he told me he‚Äôs bi and he said he always saw me checking him out and thought I was cute and he was planning on approaching me much earlier but things happened in his life. Ever since then we‚Äôve been hanging out and you guys, I think I‚Äôm falling in love ü•∞ "
1,"My mother crossed the line. Time to cut her off for good.


Throwaway for obvious reasons. 


Need to get this off my chest. I‚Äôm absolutely devastated and furious. I have never been so close to hitting that vile woman i call mother like i was tonight.


My mother has been extremely controlling and narcissistic for as long as i can remember. She has an extremely outdated view on the world. A man displaying any form of emotion is a ‚Äùfaggot‚Äù in her eyes. She hates men that arn‚Äôt macho. 


I‚Äôve been closeted my whole for this exact reason. I knew very well she would lose her shit if i told her i was gay. 


Luckily my brother is nothing like her, my older brother is among one of the most amazing, open minded, kindhearted person i‚Äôve ever met. I have a really strong bond with my brother and constantly stay at his house, cause the shit my mother puts me through is unbearable. 


I was unsure of his opinion on homosexuality considering the people he was raised by so i could never muster the courage to come out to him, but that was until recently. Fast forward a few days i came out to my brother, bawling my eyes out over his shoulder and his reaction was overwhelmingly positive. 


I stayed the night at my brothers house and got back to my mothers house the next day. For the first time in years, i was genuinely happy. I felt like i finally could be myself.


This is where the shit takes an U-turn, i don‚Äôt know what got over me. I came out to my sister over the phone, i thought she would be just as supportive as my brother. I had never seen any homophobic acts from my sister. She instantly hung up and called my mother. 


Literally three minutes later my mom storms into my room. She‚Äôs yelling, she‚Äôs hitting me, spitting on me, my sister is on my moms phone screaming her lungs out they‚Äôre both telling me that i‚Äôm a faggot that is going to burn in hell but that wasn‚Äôt even the worst part, god no. 


My mother had shown me an old picture of my father in his 20‚Äôs a few months prior, and i went ‚Äùwow dad was super attractive back then‚Äù 


She used that against me and was yelling her heart out that, that was why i called my dad attractive and that i was fantasizing about my own, biological father. Holy fucking shit. I‚Äôm shaking just typing this. No that‚Äôs not even the worst part, oh god no. 


I managed to break loose and stormed out and ran into the forest to cry. My brother called me approximately 20 mins later and told me that my mother had called him and was screaming and crying over the phone, accusing me of having sex with my own, biological brother on the days i was staying at his house. Un-fucking-believeable. 


My brother told me that he was on his way, that he would pick up my stuff from my room and that i could live with him for as long as i wanted. I was waiting outside while my brother was picking up my belongings and could still hear that vile woman screaming that we were having an incestuous relationship. I‚Äôm done. I will NEVER forgive her. Done. 


I‚Äôm typing this from my brothers house and i‚Äôll be living here for a bit. I‚Äôm so glad that i have a brother this supportive and loving. I love you big bro, more than anything.


Vent over, i‚Äôm sorry this was pretty long. "
2,"Have you ever noticed the double standard for ugly vs. attractive people?


In the middle of my bio lab the other day this hot jock guy just scratched his balls right there in front of everyone and I thought it was hot, but had an ugly, overweight, or generally just less attractive person done the same I would have thought he was weird/gross. 

I hate that I have this double standard and I hate that society does as well. "
3,"Not being balls deep into the gay ""scene"" and having lots of stereotypically gay interests and attributes doesn't make you a special snowflake. Most gay men are like you.


You are basing your impression of gay men as a whole on two things:

* The most visible examples of gay men - who happen to be the kinds of gay men who populate gay nightlife

* Portrayals of gay men in media

Cmon guys, that's straight-people-tier ignorance. Get out there and actually meet some people. "
4,"Just Came Out to my Dad


I'm a 30 year old man from the US Bible Belt (southeast) and after 15 years of living my gay life I just came out to my father. 

His reaction was positive. ""Well, that's alright son"" 

I have never felt so free. "
5,"Do you ever just suck a dick just to flex on the non sinners?.


This Christian girl was telling me how she doesn't hate the lgbt community. She doesn't hate gay or trans people. She hates the fact that they'll gay or trans or whatever. She said that you shouldn't hate the person but hate the sin. And she quoted some bible quotes for her reasoning. She didn't know I was gay. She went on her rant because we were talking about trans visibility day and stuff like that. So I thought it'd be funny to open up grindr and joke that I'm going straight to he'll or something like that. So I open up grindr and show it to her. And said as a gay person I don't apperciate her using god as a excuse to hate. And we kept arguing. While we were talking I was looking through my grindr messages. And a kid I knew from high school who's on the football team. (He's 18 and I'm 19 btw). Wanted to know I wanted some dick. That's a dumb question to ask in my opioion. So yeah I ended the conversation with the chick. Told her I had a dick to go suck. Did the grindr routine with the guy who messaged me. And maybe two hours later I was in his pickup truck with his dick in my mouth. Sinning is a lot of fun. I highly recommend it"
6,"I am pretty positive my 11 year old is gay. How can I make this easier for him? (sorry it is long)


My son is the sweetest kids you could ever meet. He is very popular in his elementary school among students of all ages and all the staff. Very outgoing. My two biggest concerns if making sure his dad and I don't fuck this up and him being bullied or beat up next year in middle school. 

Events leading up to this post: 

My son is very religious and was just baptized. I let him go to church with the in laws because he has always enjoyed it. My husband and I do not attend church. He came to me 2 weeks ago and told me something was bothering him. He said Grandma said being gay was wrong, but I have always said it was okay. He said he googled it and found scriptures and articles supporting what I say and what grandma says. I asked him if he prayed on it and he started crying and said he's been praying for 3 weeks every day and was still confused. So I talked to him about how different sects and different churches believe different things, and if he was a good person and had a good heart god would judge him on that, because there's no way to know which church is right or wrong. That seemed to make him happy. 

The next night I found him sitting alone in the dark. I asked him if he was okay and he started crying uncontrollably. I calmed him down and he said he felt alone and that he had no one to talk to. I told him if he ever felt like he could not talk to me or his dad, he could talk to the school psychologist, and that he would not tell me or anyone else what was said. That calmed him down. Then after hs dad got home he sat with him and talked with him some more. He's been happy since. 

Yesterday he asked me if he had a crush on a boy character, but not a real boy, than does that make him gay? I told him it could be that he's gay, bisexual, or bi-curious, and he might just be pansexual and attracted to the character as a person. I told him he was so young it could all be up in the air. I asked him if he had a crush on any real people, boy or girls and he said no. I asked him if he would tell me once he does and he said he would tell his friends first and then maybe me. I asked him if he told his friends about his crush on the character and he said 2 of them. 

Then today he was talking to me about this character and I asked him what it was he was attracted to, and he couldn't answer. So I asked him if he daydreams about kissing this character or saving him or having the character save him (common boy daydreams) and he said he daydreams about kissing him. I asked him if he's ever thought about kissing girls and he said he tried and it was weird. 

So I am pretty positive that he is gay. 

What we have done so far: 

He is talking to me randomly but openly, but only sparingly with his dad. This is odd because he's always been closer with his dad, but we're both open and nonjudgmental. After each conversation on the subject we remind him that anything he is feeling is normal and we will love him no matter what happens. 

I have an appointment with the school psychologist Friday and he will meet with him after. Then he will give me referrals to therapists that can help him work through this, and the school facilitator is going to find me programs to help pay for it. 

I was not going to tell anyone beyond that (because it's my son's private business) but I found out he's told 2 more friends at the school, so I am meeting with his teacher tomorrow so she can be on the look out for bullying or anything and is not blind sided with any issues that might arise. 

My son it worried about what my inlaws will think (since grandma told him being gay was a sin) so my husband and I are meeting with them tonight secretly to make sure they are okay with this and don't say anything further on it being wrong. 

I found a gay pastor who can talk to him if the sin issue continues to bother him. I have 2 friends who are gay and they were raving about their church the other night. I have not told them what is going on, but asked them if their pastor would be willing to meet with my son if he had questions on the sin issue and they said he would love to. 

My questions: 

Should I tell him to stop telling his friends so he does not get bullied? 

Should I still talk to his teacher? I feel like I am betraying his trust by telling people. 

Is there anything else I should do? 

Thank you so much. I just want my son to keep being the happy boy that he is. "
7,"My mom caught my boyfriend ""rewarding me"". . .


So I'm 23, and my parents are 100% okay with me being gay. They let my boyfriend sleep over occasionally, and after coming out at 19, they've been nothing but accepting and loving (for Jamaican parents, that's huge). The only thing they have yet to do is talk to me about sex from a homo perspective, or even mention sex since coming out (they used to give me occasional sex talks when they thought I was straight).

Well, Friday my parents and siblings went to dinner, and although we weren't planning to, me and my boyfriend decided to mess around in my room. Long story short, due to the music playing, I was unable to hear them entire the house. Meanwhile, my boyfriend is literally standing on my bed mid-cuming on my face as my mom walks in. My room door was apparently not shut completely, so she walked right in, and it was the most awkward thing ever. As soon as I turned to look at her, I felt my boyfriends cum hit the side of my face while me and my mother are looking at each other, straight eye-contact. 

She said sorry and left, which is awkward cause 1. I'm not supposed to be having sex in her house and 2. This is just humiliating and 3. I feel like she looks at me differently now. Since Friday she pretends it never happened but she hasn't made eye contact with me once whenever she talks to me. I haven't invited my boyfriend over since, but whenever we're talking it's as if she's talking to a wall or talking to the floor. I love my mom but I just don't know what to do but I don't like this weird vibe after, and my dad has only had 1-sentence convos with me since so I know she's told him. Should I apologize to them? Should me and my boyfriend do it together? I just have no idea and I'm just an anxious mess. "
8,"I just had the sweetest, most unexpected goodbye from my straight friend


 

Hey guys. So, this post isn't very sensational and is potentially not that interesting, but I wanted to share because it was an extremely unexpected moment for me that I will cherish forever.

As many of you can likely relate to, I have spent the majority of my life finding it very difficult to relate to straight men, especially if they're particularly bro-y. My experiences as a child and teenager all indicated to me that these types of guys don't generally care for me and don't want to be associated with me. I kind of accepted that for what it was and assumed it would remain true even into my adult life. But that hasn't been the case.

In the past two years I've been completing a Master's degree, and during that time I met a guy (we'll call him John) that I became great friends with and ended up living with for the past year. John is the type of guy that I generally would have assumed wouldn't like me, because he's kind of a hockey bro and I felt like I had a hard time relating to that. In spite of my hesitation, we became incredibly good friends.

This past Monday we wrote the final exam of our degree, and tonight we went out together to party for the last time before I moved back home to start my full-time job. When we got home from the bar, something happened that I wasn't expecting. After I took off my shoes, John came over to me and gave me one of the best, most genuine hugs I've ever received. He told me that he loved me and that I'm one of his best friends, and I told him the same. We probably spent 30+ minutes just holding each other and talking about how much we love each other and how we're going to make sure we stay in contact even after we've parted ways. I admitted to him that I've had bad experiences in the past with guys like him not liking me which resulted in me building up a bit of a wall, and he just hugged me more and told me that he loved me no matter what and that he couldn't wait to be at my wedding to support me and my future husband. He even kissed my neck, which to me was just the sweetest most genuine expression of platonic affection. I just... I was never expecting him to express himself so deeply to me, and it feels so good to have built the kind of friendship where sexuality is irrelevant and where he feels comfortable being so intimate with me. It truly is a memory that I will cherish forever."
9,"I met my boyfriend's mother yesterday


  

My boyfriend and I have been dating for almost 10 months, and it‚Äôs been the best relationship of my life. Pretty fuckin healthy, if I do say so myself. He met my parents a little over a month ago, which went very well, but I wasn‚Äôt really planning on meeting his mom for another \~4 ish months. He‚Äôs from Mexico, and he always goes to visit her for Christmas but she‚Äôs only been able to see him once in the US. They‚Äôre very close, and text all the time, so I had been a little nervous (or maybe more) about meeting her, but figured I still had some time. I also needed time to learn Spanish, because even though I took a few years of Spanish in high school and did well in the classes, I never spoke it particularly well and it‚Äôs been a while since then. She speaks maybe 20 words in English. 

The day before yesterday, though, my boyfriend had been having a pain in his side for a while, and we ended up going to the ER. It was appendicitis. It‚Äôs very hectic, and he can‚Äôt get a good signal on his phone but I can so suddenly I‚Äôm in a group chat with his family trying to use a mix of Spanish from six years ago, hasty Google translations, and instructions from my in pain bf to communicate. His mom is booking plane tickets. 

That evening I‚Äôm hastily trying to clean up his apartment (it‚Äôs not dirty, but his mom is very clean) and shoving sex toys into a suitcase to put in the back of my car. The surgery the next day went all right, and a few of his friends came. One of them picked up his mom at the airport while another drove me back to his place to help clean some more. We stopped on the way back to the hospital to get his mom some flowers and a pack of cigarettes, since I want to make a good impression. I‚Äôm not sure what she smokes so I got her what my bf smokes. 

I met her at the hospital and tried to remember the phrase I‚Äôd memorized all morning (Yo pense que tendria mas tiempo para aprendar mas espanol antes de conocerla), but stumbled on it. My boyfriend and his friends laughed, because it was funny and because they‚Äôre assholes, and she had me lean forward and she kissed me on the cheek. Today when we brought my bf back from the hospital she thanked me, she‚Äôd apparently told my bf that she was glad he had me. It wasn‚Äôt what I‚Äôd planned for, but to me it was a good moment. She‚Äôs going to be here for the next two weeks or so, though, so I better clean my car and hit up Duolingo again.  "
10,"My Dad is making me to choose between being gay or have a relationship with him and continue living in his home.


My dad thinks the idea of two men is so disgusting that he said he would kill himself first before laying down with another man. He hates the idea that I'm gay and believes I'm an embarrassment and a disappointment. I had got int trouble this weekend about something else, but this came up just because. I came out nine months prior to him, but he still isn't accepting it. We had a long argument and he had stated that it's either I be gay or I have a relationship with him, can't be both. On top of that, he said if I continue to be gay, then I have to move out. I'm in no position to even live on my own right now, I have my own job but I pay a car note, car insurance, and other smaller bills. I put myself in a bubble all weekend (he said all this Saturday) and I'm in complete disbelief and surprised. He doesn't understand that being gay isn't something you just ""turn off"". It's apart of who I am and he's making me choose between who I am vs our relationship and some where to live. I don't know what to do right now other than comply, but I see myself falling into deep depression if I don't figure something out. Any advice would be helpful. Thank you. üíØüíØ

P.S. I wrote this post yesterday, but had to delete it for anonymous reasons. "
11,"In Home GloryHole Experiences


Recently, I set up a GloryHole in my home.  I went to Home Depot, had a board cut to fit, bought a hole bit &amp; some sand paper.  From there, I posted to all the usual places &amp; voila I now I have a virtual line of dick waiting to get sucked off every damn day.

Now, before you go slut shaming me, please let me tell you that I am on HIV negative &amp; take Truvada religiously.  I do believe in love &amp; I would prefer to be with one person.  However, during the interim, I have no problem practicing my oral skills on the adjacent university boys.

From regulars to newbies, each dick is a different experience.  My oral skills have gotten so much better that I now get compliments when not at my GloryHole.  Also, this has given me more sexual confidence in public and in more intimate settings.

I know this is an unusual sexual practice &amp; I will probably get down voted for it.  Regardless of consequence, I believe in expressing an opinion even if it is not a popular one.  Also, I am not ashamed of my sexual dexterity &amp; I am curious to hear about what you dudes think about this situation: have you been to one, does it make you curious, outraged?"

14,"Being Fem Really Does Have It Perks.


I was approached on the bus today by this really cute Arab jock today. I‚Äôm not that fem tbh. Like I dress like the typical straight guy. I don‚Äôt have a gay face. But I do have some feminine mannerisms and a slightly gay voice that sparks gaydars.  

Because of my femininity, I‚Äôve been approached by cute masc closeted gay guys at the mall, grocery stores, the bus, etc. 

I have masculine gay friends that are depressed because no gay guys approach them or know they‚Äôre gay. So they have a hard time meeting gay guys. "
15,"Can someone help a newbie understand the unwritten rules and etiquette of dating other men?


I'm 25, recently came out, living in the city, and have been trying to start dating. But I find myself confused sometimes about how to handle certain situations that I hadn't confronted before I started dating other men. If someone could cure my ignorance here, I'd be very thankful. 

1. If I'm on a date with someone who I don't already know and he excuses himself to use a public restroom *and I also have to pee,* is it okay to go with him to the restroom? I wouldn't think twice about it if I was having dinner with a straight guy friend. But in a first-date context I worry it might seem creepy or send the wrong message. 
2. One guy offered to pick me up before our date. I was floored because it had never occurred to me before coming out that I'd ever be in the position of being picked up at my home for a date. I thought it was sweet of him (plus I hate driving). Not even sure I have a question here.
3. Gays always split the check, right? Just making sure.
4. I have a complicated family and social background when it comes to my being gay. Is this a normal sort of thing to talk about on a first date, or is this oversharing? It is pretty personal, but is it a common enough thing among gay guys so that it isn't distasteful to discuss?
5. Where I grew up, there are social norms for dating among straight people that tell you *who* is supposed to do *what:* for example, the guy arranges the logistics of the date and might picks the girl up beforehand, the girl tends to control how far things go (sexually speaking), and the guy pays unless the girl suggests otherwise. These rules obviously don't work when it's just two dudes, which means I now have to negotiate through decisions on dates where, if I were straight, we would just follow the general rule. Does anyone who's been in my boat before have any general advice for dealing with this? 

I feel like I suck at being gay, guys. I only have a few scattered gay friends and I'm not used to socializing with other gay people now that I'm also out. I've never had issues before with basic social interactions and now i'm flying blind. Help!"
16,"My boyfriend is bisexual, and after 5+ months of dating, he said he doesn‚Äôt think he can be happy with a man


Hey bros... I‚Äôm a wreck. An absolute shitshow right now. My boyfriend (19), someone I (20) would say I love, called me last week and told me he didn‚Äôt want to talk to me for a while because he needed space. He needed to figure out what he wanted. It broke my heart but I said of course, take the time you need. Well a few minutes ago he called because of some other things, and we got onto what was going on. I was drinking, it‚Äôs about 3am, and I‚Äôve been missing him so much that I started crying and asking what happened. 

He got mad and after a while said ‚ÄúFine, you wanna know? I don‚Äôt think I can be happy with a guy. There. Fuck.‚Äù I‚Äôm crying again typing this, but I don‚Äôt know what‚Äôs going on now. He still wants his time and space to figure things out, but I‚Äôm feeling so hurt and betrayed and just incredibly broken that I don‚Äôt know what to do. Have any of you gone through this? I‚Äôd absolutely love to hear some happy ending stories like this because I‚Äôm shattered right now. "
17,"I told my boss about Truvada, and he hugged me. Welcome to 2019.


I've been on Truvada for PrEP for a month or so.  I come from a rougher background but I'm doing a lot better for myself now.  I didn't realize how privileged I truly was until I wanted to get on PrEP.

Essentially it was an easy process.  My GP had never worked with a PrEP patient before, so she had me do a phone consultation with an infectious disease doctor.  Several UI's and blood tests later, and I got a 3 month supply in the mail.  My copay was just $100, and even that is reimbursed by Gilead.  I put off getting on PrEP because I thought it would be difficult and intimidating, but it was barely more difficult than getting a flu shot.  Thanks, health insurance.  The situation in the US is much, much different for a lot of our population.  

For the last month, I've felt nausea like I've never felt before.  It was so bad.  I ended up taking off work like once per week for the last month.  I was a mess.  I got a script for an anti-nausea med this weekend that is helping, but I wanted to let my boss know why I was missing work.

I was very nervous, but wanted to be open.  Mine is the kind of boss where, if I say I need to take the day, he'll respond with ""just don't get too drunk.""  I asked if he knew what Truvada was - he did, and I didn't have to explain a thing.  I let him know I was experiencing some reactions but they should be under control.  He asked if there was anything he could do, I let him know his patience was so much appreciated.  I went into shake his hand, and then he pulled me in and hugged me, told me to take care of myself.

I'm 24 years old, and this is the world I live in.  I still remember when people regularly got fired in my state for being gay.  Here I am telling my boss I'm on a med so I don't get HIV, and he hugs me.  I've been watching a lot of documentaries on what the AIDS crisis was like in the 1980's in this country, before I was born.  I almost weep when I think about how far we've come.

Not really a question, just have to express my gratitude to the universe."
