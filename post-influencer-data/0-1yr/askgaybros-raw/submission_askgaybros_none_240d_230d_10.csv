0,"Feeling toxic/insecure


I know what you guys are gonna say - I‚Äôm super insecure, toxic and need therapy. Yes, I agree. I just wanna share my feelings, maybe i can get your guys‚Äô input. 

I‚Äôve been having the same never-ending argument with my (6 mo) bf. I feel extremely and irrationally jealous when he hangs out (or even mentions) some of his friends. These are the ones he‚Äôs had intimacy with. I know they‚Äôd known each other before me, and it‚Äôs not wrong for him to hang out or chat with his friends. I‚Äôm not sure when it all started, but I voiced my feelings at the beginning, and he‚Äôs  been understanding, and he‚Äôs even cut back on being as friendly with them as he was before.

I feel like when I hear their names, I am entitled to feel upset about it. In some instances I feel like I‚Äôm being laughed at (yeah, delusional, I know). I just want to understand this feeling, where it‚Äôs stemming from. Anyone had the same experience/feeling before?

What upsets me most is that I can rationalise it (‚Äòyeah fine, he made out with X and had sex with Y, and then became friends‚Äô), but I still feel jealous when he meets them for a catch up (which happens maybe once a month). And it‚Äôs almost like a knee reflex when he mentions them, I get upset. He‚Äôs been feeling like he‚Äôs holding back too much, and I know I‚Äôm being extremely selfish - I need help. "
1,"How to deal with loneliness?


I've been single for 5 years now. I'm a good looking guy (without being superficial or arrogant about it, I'm just confident enough to admit to it). But still, most guys I meet only want sex, or behave as if they want to have something serious other than fuck you over with it later by cheating or saying ""we weren't really being serious anyway"".

So the question is, to every single guy out there that's looking for something MORE, how do you deal with it? Do you suppress it? Are you having sex with loads of guys to mask the loneliness? Do you straight up deny you need someone in order to truly be happy? Interested in hearing opinions..."
2,"What is the most gay accepting/friendly country or city you have been to ?


There are probably some obvious ones like San Francisco or Seattle, but are there any places that surprised you in how accepting they were ?"

4,"Best place in USA


Dear gaybros,

Currently I am studying at American uni in European campus, senior year and I gotta make plans for career after school ends, and It needs to be out of this shithole. I have been thinking about USA for a long time, especially big ciites in USA. But i would like to know which cities are gay friendly, and also with possibility for careers in tourism (im a hospitality major, would like to work in marketing related field, but my chances are low). I know for San Francisco, Los Angeles, New York, etc. But these are expensive cities, although i would love being there it's probably not easy. What about Seattle, Austin, those kind of places. I just want to have the possibility to meet new people who can openly be gay, somewhere where maybe something more serious is possible, since its not possible to meet guys normally, but only through grindr. Also I like more srcuffyer men. I hope I was clear, although i already see this is a mess haha. I hope my question is acceptable here.

TL:DR which US cities are gay friendly for a young and sad gay guy from Europe, want to find job is some of them.

5,"Will I ever have my moment? It sucks to suck.


Most people shine at different phases of their lives. As for me, I haven't shined one bit yet. All my life I was pretty much that lonewolf gay guy that nobody really cares about, let alone notice my presence when I'm around. And when they do notice me, it's usually not too positive. 

No smiles, no friendliness, no convos, no sparks of attraction, and absolutly nothing of that ""feels good, man"" sort of feeling that I want others to feel when they interact with me. Of course, I obviously can't control how other people feel when they meet me, but at the same time I'm so tired of giving off those not-so-good first impressions. Seriously, y'know what I'm talking about? It's like I got the fashion in check and hence look decent on the outside, but somehow the vibe I give off to others is one of a weird one--for the lack of a better word. I can't quite grasp what it is about the way I come off to others. Idk, I guess to put it simply, people just don't seem to like me.

Heck, there was never a time throughout my 25 years of being alive where everyone liked me and gave me the attention that I needed, unlike the other so-called popular college kids who are getting loved by everyone they encounter.

Damn, it sucks to suck. I'm human and need some lovin', too. So why the hell are all these people having those glorious moments and not me? Talk about unfairness."
6,"Best articles or books to send to my overly religious mother on homosexuality?


Hi all,

I‚Äôm sure some of you out there have great articles that may explain homosexuality (And LBTQ) to someone that may not understand (she‚Äôs Christian)? Tired of having the same conversation with my mother and have almost stalled all communication as it‚Äôs emotionally draining, so would rather send her articles for her own education. 

Thanks"
7,"These feelings just hit me so hard again


""Hi guys, I haven't been on reddit for a long time but I really needed to talk to our community. When I came out my parents threw me out and they haven't spoken to me. I moved in another house on our street. And now there is this guy, 2 years younger than me. He is our neighbour and he came out and his whole family, including his grandparents accept and fully support him and talk about it like it's normal and no big deal and our society is very unfriendly towards gays. And I am feeling 2 things at the same time: I am so happy for this guy and soo pissed! Why couldn't my family support me? Why is it so unfair?! I hate this life and how envious I feel, because it is pathetic. I don't like that feeling but I can't let it go because it is so strong. My family, including my brothers and sister pass me on the street like they have never seen me. Their children have no idea I am their uncle, I am just the stranger that lives nearby. And there is this guy with his perfect loving family and I hate this so much I feel like crying!""


I shared this some time ago with you guys. And today I relived things again- I saw my sister with her kids and I just wanned to say hi. I love them so much. And I just went ahead and said hey how have you been, and she just kept walking. One of the kids asked her who I was and she said no one."
8,"Dealing with STDs


So even though I identify as a straight male, I've found out that I have a fetish for choking on dick. Not a big deal, it doesn't bother me mentally, I don't care about labeling myself and so forth.

 I have zero romantic interest in men for any other reason. The thought of cuddling or kissing turns me off.

The obvious issue is the problem of STDs, as it's usually just extremely sexually active men who'd agree to such an agreement. I don't want to catch anything, but the main turn on is having the dick ejaculate in my throat. You can see the problem here.

Thoughts?"

10,"I‚Äôm the worse at talking to anyone or maybe the person I talk to is


I barely came out and haven‚Äôt talked to any guys before last time I did was in high school 

Sorta get upset at the fact I talk to someone and then it seems good then get stood up lol ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è 

I don‚Äôt really label myself so maybe some people thinks differently about me idk really 
I‚Äôm not really looking for hook ups just trying to talk to someone like date or friends but online since I‚Äôm not very social in person I am starting to be more confident in person tho lol

Eh i just wanted to rant about how lame stuff been xD

11,"Subreddit for trading underwear


I'm not familiar with any subreddits specifically for trading underwear, they're generally for sale/selling, but I don't wanna sell.

Does anyone know any subreddits in particular for *trading*?"
12,"Which historical or artistic figures (writers, musicians, filmmakers, painters) were you surprised to know were gay?


Hans Christian Anderson, who wrote The Little Mermaid and The Snow Queen. At first I was surprised but then it makes sense if you understand the subtext of some of the tales he wrote. Like ""The Ugly Duckling"", which is about a duckling who's rejected by his (adopted) family and strangers because he's ""different"". "
13,"Czech Hunter/Dirty Scout is over?


Two weeks that nothing is posted and the site layout has also changed, does anyone know anything?"
14,"Have any of you guys hiked the PCT (or other thru hike)?


I'm really outdoorsy but I haven't met a lot of gay guys who are into backpacking. I hiked the JMT last summer and I'm planning on hiking the PCT in 2019. 
I was wondering if any of you guys have experience on these kinds of trails and could share their experience. Did you meet any other gay guys? Did you tell anyone?"
15,"Tips to keep being hard before topping


Hey guys! i've been in a relationship with my boyfriend for seven months now, and from the beginning, i've only bottomed. i tried topping multiple times cause we both wanted it, but everytime i'm about to penetrate him, i get nervous and afraid i won't be able to do it, i'm having trouble to keep my dick hard which results in me not being able to top him. it's getting nerve-wracking, i feel stupid because i want to do it so badly; i'm really turned on by the idea. and i don't know what to do anymore! Do you have any tips? "
16,"Any Bipolar Gaybros here? How do you deal with it? If you had a bf (or do), what could he do to help you?


Hey Gaybros, throw away act cause bf uses reddit. I was wondering if any of you are bipolar and how you deal with it? My bf of 10 months recently has begun to accept that he may be bipolar and I'm not sure how I can help him best. Any suggestions or personal experiences? Thanks!"
17,"My gym teacher always stares at me... and fuck, I love it.


It's something I always kinda noticed in my volleyball class.

For example, when he's talking to the class and instructing us about volleyball, he would turn his head at me and look me right in the eyes... at least 90% of the time while he's talking--and that's *a lot* if you ask me. Also, the other day my friend and I went to his office to ask him questions about the class. Despite my friend doing ALL of the talking, my gym teacher would keep staring at me instead of my friend. In addition to this, he loves to shout comments at me a lot during our volleyball matches, as well as give me compliments for every good play I do, while seldom says anything to the other students that were also playing.

Quite frankly, I actually fantasize about him a lot while I'm jacking off. I even fantasize myself ""riding him"" in his office, it gets my dick so fucking hard. So now, I'm paranoid that he's a ""mind-reader"" and could *sense* that I think he's hot.

Anyways, do you think he secretly feels the same way towards me, too? Like, perhaps on a subconscious level where he doesn't realize it. You have to admit, his constant eye-balling towards me does sound a little weird. 

Or maybe, just maybe (and I know it sounds conceited as hell...) I'm sort of pretty for a guy? Indeed, I put a lot of effort into my hair and put on a bit of foundation on my face as well. Yep, even for volleyball class! I always make sure to look good no matter where I go. And because of that, my gym teacher is now questioning his sexuality... shit, idk."
