0,"Weird post, doubts of being gay. 21M


Hey dudes. This is a weird post, so feel free to skip to the final paragraph. 

&amp;#x200B;

Well, I'm fairly certain I'm not gay. Thing is, I have amazing relationships with my friends. There's a lot of compassion, supportiveness and pure love within my group of close friends. I understand my fellow men, you know? Women on the other hand, not so much. I have connected deeply with other guys, but I always mess up those connections with women, where there's romance and sexuality involved. Due to the lack of good relationships with women, maybe, the thought of me being gay hasn't let go. It's just a thought, a doubt that comes and goes. I'm a bit annoyed by this at times actually, because I'm so sure I'm not attracted to men. I can be falling asleep and if the thought crosses my mind I get alarmed. 

&amp;#x200B;

So, I'm a horny fucker like every other human being. And I find women attractive, sexually speaking. Not men though. Not for a second, ever, have I looked at a dude's bulge and been like ""mmm yummy"" haha. This is the basis for my main conviction that I'm not homosexual. I think it makes sense. Still tho, I'm very open to new experiences, so I have experimented with anal play before u know. But fooling around with a dude? No, I don't think that's for me. 

&amp;#x200B;

The question I wanna ask is this. Before coming out or getting in touch with your sexuality, did you find yourselves fantasizing about other men and not women? Or was is more like I described above? I'm really into bodybuilding too so I spend more time looking at muscular dudes than sexy girls. I can get a strong reaction at times, but it's more so aesthetically appreciative than attraction, and admiration. Anyway, thanks for reading "

4,"Did you see yoir friends Dick when you were a teenager? Lol


So I have heard stories of straight and gay guys that when they were 17-19 they saw there friends dicks and it was normal at all, I was a bit shocked because I was always so reserved and if you showed your dick you were gay or wanted to see other guys, is it true? Did this happen to you and how did it happen?"
5,"My first gay experience. I need help making a relationship with this guy. Please halp.


&amp;#x200B;

I can't believe I'm posting on here. Most of this is going to be rambling but I just really need some advice right now. I've been in the closet all my life. I'm bisexual. 19. Male. Freshman at college. I've been with a few girls during high school but none of them were special.

About a few months ago I got into Grindr/Tindr. I met this guy. He lives on campus. Literally a two-minute walk from my dorm hall. He's an RA, Senior upperclassman. We met through Grindr. He hit me up first. We talked for over a week before meeting up. It took us so long to meet up because of me. I was afraid to meet him because I thought he wouldn't like me or some shit. I was nervous. Anyways, finally I grow a pair and I go to his place. The first time I see him I felt like I was gonna pass out. I was nervous as shit. My hands were shaking. My legs were weak. It was hard to speak and breathe in front of him.

Anyways when I finally get there, he shows me around his apartment. Then we started watching TV on his couch. We talked and watched TV for a good two hours. I revealed to him more things than I've ever revealed to anyone else. I have a trust issues and I rarely talk to people about my personal life. After about two hours of talking he tells me his roommate is gone for the night. And I could spend the night at his place if I wanted. I don't say anything. I'm kinda shocked. Nervous as hell. He then asks it’s up to me and we can do whatever I want tonight. I take a moment before I answer. I tell him I'm fine doing whatever he wants. He responds immediately with, ""Well I want to kiss you."" I stammer for words. My hands shaking. I tell him that would be great. I can't even look him in the eye I'm so nervous. He can tell. He tells me not to worry. And to relax while grabbing my hand. He leans and gives me my first kiss ever with a guy. I loved it. We begin making out. After a few minutes of making out. He takes me back into his room. And we have the best sex I've ever had. (I'm a top btw).

We had sex until about 5 am. I had class in the morning, so we couldn't go all night. We lay together in his bed. Talk about life. What we want in life. What we believe. Politics, life, love, etc. He falls asleep first. I lay there for a good 10 mins just watching him sleep. The smell of his hair...his lips....his voice. I've never felt this about anyone before.

I get up a few hours later. He's fast sleep. I get dressed and give a kiss on his neck before leaving. Two days goes by with us not talking. Those two days were absolute hell. I missed him. A shit ton. I wanted to talk with him. To be with him. But I didn't want to come off as needy. I wanted it to be more than a hookup. I grow a pair and text him ""hey."" We text back for a bit and he invites me over. It's a Saturday night so I chill at his place til like 3 am. We made out. He sucked my dick,etc. We didn't have sex cause his roommate was in. We watched the entire second season of stranger things together on Netflix and cuddled for a good remainder of the night.

After that I hit up about a week later. It was a Friday night and I was drunk as fuck. I came back to campus and I asked if I could see him. He knew I was drunk and let me sleep it off on his couch. We weren't intimate that night. He watched tv next to me while I was passed out. I finally left his place around 4 am.

About two weeks later he's back into town from a Vegas trip he went on and hits me up. I'm so happy. Every time I'm not with one. I'm somewhat sad. Because I feel like it’s just like a onetime hookup and I'll never see him again. It's one of the reasons why I drink heavily on the weekends especially when he doesn't text me. Anyways he hits me up and we get some fast food together and then head back to his place. We watch some Netflix and just chill with each other. No sex, no physical intimacy that night. I left his place feeling depressed. I thought maybe he didn't like anymore or something.

About another two weeks passes and he hits me up again. He asks me how I've been and invites me over to his place to chill and do homework since we both had some work to do. I show up to his place and we chill and do homework for about an hour. After we finish our work we sit on his couch and talk about random stuff. Finally after the conversation ends I say, ""Can I um.....Can I um...uh.... I was wondering if I could um...... If I could...."" I do that for about 30 seconds. I wanted to kiss him. But I was so afraid to ask. I was terrified. He smiles. Crosses his legs together and moves in towards me. ""What do you want to do?"" he whispers with a smirk. I finally say I want to kiss him. He answers yes. And we immediately start making out. I was revealed. I missed him. I was terrified he didn't like me anymore and was just hanging out with me outta pitty. We make out for a while and then we have sex in shower because his roommate was in again. After we finished having sex I go back to my place.

I haven't seen him since that night. That was over two weeks ago. I hit up last Thursday and asked if he wanted to hangout, but he was busy. He had meetings to go for classes. Which makes sense since he is a senior and he is doing a lot of academic shit. Then on Sunday I hit up again and we talked over text for a little bit. We talked about midterms, our weekend, and what we've been up to. The last thing I say to him in our text convo is to hit me up if he wants to hangout later this week. He responded with a smile and said of course and wished me a goodnight.

I want to date this guy. I've never felt an attachment to someone after having sex with them. I love his voice, his eyes, the smell of his hair, everything. He's the nicest guy. But when I'm not around him I think that he views me as just a hookup. I really want to be in a relationship with him. How do I let him know this? How do I get in a relationship with this guy? If he doesn't ask me to hangout by Friday night should I text him and ask him if he wants to hangout? If I'm going to ask him to be in a relationship or that I want to eventually have a relationship with him, I prefer to do it in person. What should I do? This eating me up inside and I need advice."

7,"So amyl has just straight up ruined two hookups in a row for me


Unbelievable.


First hookup with a guy yesterday, awkwardly and abruptly ended when he  was about to fuck me, but couldn’t stay hard.  Initially thought it was me but instead turns out he was suffering from withdrawal. (There was an empty amyl bottle lying on his desk)   “I just ran out of amyl....I need it....I can’t get stay hard without it :( sorry if I possibly wasted your time mate....but should we just call it quits?”.

Then tonight just now, hooked up with another dude, he says he likes amyl, am I ok with it? I tell him preferably not  i hate it, but if you must,  it’s fine as long as I can’t smell it’s disgusting scent, all good, so we meet, he’s cute and all, and he says I’m super cute and have a nice dick too, we’re blowing each other, I’m about ready to fuck him, he’s taking a second sniff of amyl.  But suddenly he’s losing his erection and says “I have a headache...new bottle, new brand of amyl....it’s terrible. I can’t continue ☹️”. He insisted it wasn’t me and he was sorry but tbh I’m just pissed really and needed to vent "

13,"Hi, question regarding post-op transitioning side effects.


Hi all. I just recently had my penis cut off and had an artificial vagina glued to my pelvis.


About 2 weeks ago, I started noticing a *foul* smell coming from my groin area every time I opened by legs. It smelled like a sack of dead animals sitting in the Texas heat for a month. 

Fast forward to a couple nights ago, I was taking a shit and noticed the development of mold around the edges of my vagina. I tried scraping it off with a knife, burning it, rubbing alcohol, you name it. Nothing works. 

Was wondering if anyone had any experience with this and how to deal with it. 

Also, my hormone pills are making me bleed from my asshole, how do I prevent this from happening? Or is it natural?"
