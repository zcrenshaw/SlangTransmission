0,"I kissed my friend and I liked it, except I was convinced I am straight - UPDATE: I told him


If you guys remember my last post, my best friend of 4 years and I spontaneously kissed one evening. I've been straight my whole life, but I started having feelings for him.

We saw each other several times between that evening and last night and I couldn't gather the courage to tell him. It's been the most confusing several days I've ever had. I don't want to sound too dramatic, but it's like I don't know who I am anymore. I've been having all of these feelings for the first time, and I've been freaking out over so many different hypotheticals and it's just been generally incredibly stressful.

Yesterday, my parents were out so we finally had the chance to meet somewhere private (we usually hang out on the beach which contributed to my lack of courage to say anything). We hung out as usual for a few hours until I finally did it.

I asked him if he was wondering why I kissed him that day. He said he figured I would tell him when I felt like it. I told him I've been having feelings stronger than friendship towards him, and at that moment, kissing him just seemed like the right thing to do. 

Now this is something that I didn't mention in my last post, but he asked me if I'm sure those feelings started because of him as a person or because of what I've been through this past year. The thing is my sister got really badly sick, it was absolutely horrendous, she suffered a lot and died several months ago, and I was a complete wreck. He was there for me throughout the whole thing and I know I would have lost my mind (or worse) if I didn't have him. So last night he asked if I was sure my attraction to him was because of him, or because I was still grieving and needed him.

I told him I *was* still grieving but that I'm not having these feelings because I need him but because I want him. That kiss was like a stab in the stomach and a punch in the brain, I never had a kiss that felt more right than that one. I told him I was also still processing everything because he is a guy and this is all new to me, and I said that if he wants us to just be friends, that's fine, because I value our friendship more than anything.

He hugged me and we just sat there like that for at least a few minutes. I couldn't help myself and I started crying. He let go of the hug and he told me that he was painfully in love with me when we just became friends at 15, and that he understands how I must be feeling. I asked if that means he isn't in love with me anymore, and he said I was his soul mate. He said we should give it a shot at being more than friends but that we should go about it carefully since he doesn't want to fuck up what we have as friends. We talked about it some more and it took me a little while to pull myself together, but in the end, we agreed on some ""ground rules"".

We spent the rest of the evening sitting on my bed in each other's arms and watching Netflix. He slept over, and this morning we cuddled a bit before he went home. My heart is so full. My brain is still freaking out, and I still feel like I don't know who I am anymore, but we're going to take it slow. We agreed not to call it a ""relationship"" but more like a trial period to see if my feelings are as legit as I think they are, and to see if he's feeling comfortable about the whole thing too."
1,"Grindr horror story


I (33) was on a trip in Bucharest Romania earlier this month. I had a  lot of free time one afternoon so I got on Grindr and starting texting  with this cute younger guy (20 years old or something). We agree to meet  in the evening by the subway exit close to my hotel.

When  the time came, I showed up by the subway exit and stood about 15 feet  from the exit in order to see him walk out before he could see me.

5  minutes after the time we were supposed to meet, I get a call from him.  He is asking me : ""Where are you? where are you?"". I answer that I'm  outside the station in the street by the main entrance.  He tells me to  come down into the station to meet him there (it was quite late at  night, and the station wasn't busy at all).  While he was talking to me,  I  hear people around him whispering to him. I got a bad vibe that he  wasn't alone.

We got cut off...  and he started texting me insistently telling me to come down.  I take a  peak through the glass window of the subway entrance and see him and 5  other guys waiting for me downstairs.

I  ran as fast as I could. I turned into a quiet street and hid behind a  large tree. I immediately called an uber to go to the center of town and  get away from this neighborhood. I felt terrified.

I have no idea what those guys would have done to me... but it would have been bad.

The  night ended well thankfully... I hooked up with two really hot  Romanians and we had a threesome together. But this experience left me a  bit traumatized... I'm extra careful when I use Grindr now."

4,"So I went to the local Pride parade...


I met a cute guy and we spent the day walking with the parade, holding hands, and making out in a nearby park. 

I grew up on the countryside where gays ""don't exist"" and until I moved to the city I had to endure endless rants about how gays ""should be sent to Auschwitz"" or ""should be made vanished"" almost daily (luckily wasn't out at the time). 

So this was the first time I've been so intimate with a guy. Or anyone for that matter. 
I told him that, and he said it's okay. 

I've never felt so comfortable with my sexuality than on this day. People say we don't need the parades anymore, but I definitely did. 

That's all."

One day during a shower, I decided to send a random boner pic to my boyfriend. Unfortunately, in my masturbatory haze, I accidentally sent the pic to a group chat that was full of basically our entire social circle. 

While frantically trying to find the button on my phone that reverses time and space, my boyfriend replies ""I see you're ready for date night ;)."" This reply was IN the group chat, which had people I had know since childhood. 

Fuck my life."
6,"Dating Advice: Instead of constantly looking for Prince Charming to sweep you off your feet, why not put in mutual effort to be a Prince Charming as well.


I’ve been on a dating spree this summer, and my biggest observation so far has been that there are so many guys who half ass dating. For instance, so many guys out there don’t understand that it’s kind to ask the other person about their day or themselves (because guess what, that’s part of getting to know each other). Also, if you want to go out, it doesn’t always have to be the other guy asking you out. Believe it or not, you can suggest plans for dates as well! The number of guys who literally expect the other guy to do all the planning is absurd. Put effort into it guys! Get to know someone! Come up with things to do!"

8,"I received a threat letter from 'Anonymous' in the mail about Grindr today. Please help


It wasn't addressed to me, just 'to the resident'.

This is the letter:

Blurred out parts are my name (registered name on Grindr, not actual name), phone number and address. It includes my neighbours address too so I'm guessing they have my IP address?

There are 3 following pages that contain screenshots of my Grindr profile and pictures I've sent on there, including my face. It includes a screenshot of my profile from about 1-2 months ago (different profile picture). One of the pictures is one I very rarely send so I do believe they have all my other pics too.


I normally wouldn't check the mail but happen to today because I'm expecting something. My dad would have otherwise opened it and I'm not out. I have no idea what to do. I'm so creeped out and I feel sick.

I have never given my address to anyone. I do give out my number quite easily but only to meet people I intend on meeting and I know are real.

Please help. What do I do? Should I go to the police? It obviously can't actually be 'Anonymous' so who would do this?"

10,"My boyfriend of 2 years is on Grindr and I feel sick


Well guys. I feel sick to my stomach and my hands are shaking  typing this but I need some advice. Sorry for the long post.

&amp;#x200B;

For two years I have been in a relationship with my current boyfriend. He is very loving, is always talking about our future together (ie what dogs we will have, house, etc...) although we are 22 and 23. He has said multiple times how breaking up would be the dumbest thing and that i owed him a punch if he broke up with me. We had met on Grindr and chat for about a month, followed by a month of dates before we where boyfriends.

He is currently doing an internship in the south of the country for 3 months (he is 1.5 months in). We talk on the phone about 3 times a day and he has visited me once since going and I have also visited him once.

On the day I visited him I was feeling he was very distant from me. He didnt hug me when he left his house (because he lives with a lot of guys on his internship and they think he's straight, he said). It got better after a few hours and we went to his room to pick up some stuff. I asked him abou his new smartphone and he handed it over. I started looking at some stuff and he took it back (we usually allow some privacy when it comes to messages and such). When he took it back I said ""Show me you don't have Grindr installed"" kinda jokingly but also kinda serious. He didn't say anything and pocketed the phone. I found that weird and repeated my request. He said ""In a minute"". At the time we where with friends in the room and I didnt want to cause some big drama and I just went to him as he moved away from the bed we where sitting on. He went to his drawer and said ""Oh yeah, I have gifts for you"" and handed me a chocolate bad and an open small can of pringles. He then moved to the corridor and told everyone we should get going for our walk. He then said he had to piss and rushed to the bathroom. I waited outside the bathroom, worried that he went to delete Grindr. I didn't hear any pissing noises but he flushed. When he left I gave him a concerned look and he made a face that said he understood my accusation. He said ""what are you doing here"" and I just said his name. He said he really did go to piss and that he would never have had installed grindr and he hug me. I thought about how he pisses sitting down and how that would not be noisy and I felt guilty for being suspicious and I hug him back and apologised. The rest of the night was a bit awkward between us.

When I got back home I was sitll a little suspicious and I decided to install an Android emulator, Grindr, and Fake GPS.

I created the perfect bait account for him and placed it 300 meters away from him.

He did not appear on the nearby accounts and I felt more releieved.

For a week I asked the blank profiles for pictures and none of them where him.

Yesterday I was going to delete the emeulator. I felt bad that I was using it and I opened it one last time before deleting.

And there he was, 5th closest person.

His profile picture was one that I had taken myself. He is visibly wearing  the ring that he gave me and bought one for himself as ""compromise rings"".

I felt completely sick.

Everything started shaking and I felt my heartbeat all over my body.

I took screenshots of his account.

He had a secondary pic where he was topless (which killed my hopes he was only doing it for friends).

I messaged and he replied in an hour.

I spent the whole night thinking and shaking and writing and crying. Went to bed after sunrise.

In the morning we had our usual calls. He seemed very cuddly and normal.

I kept chatting throught the fake account to see if he was up for a hookup and he said he was. Said he was ""very big on cuddling and makeouts"". But he also said I, the fake acocunt, was his first hookup.

I just feel my world has been shattered and I do not know who to talk to. I don't know if I want to confront him with this. I love him and I do not want to lose him. What should I do?"
11,"Saw a guy in the gym, don’t know what to do


Might sound strange, but I usually go tot he gym at around 11 at night cuz of my study &amp; work schedule. Sometimes there’s just me, other times there’s a few guys there. (FYI, I don’t do hookups &amp; I don’t go to the gym to meet guys). About 2 months ago, I saw this guy, average build, about my height, and seems less experienced at the gym. He often goes with his brother (I assumed, cuz they look very much alike). I noticed him looking at me through the mirror while I was working out a few times, but I somehow can’t figure out if he’s gay, and I don’t feel comfortable looking straight at him or anyone in the gym for some reason.

He always leaves the gym earlier than me cuz I usually workout for about 2 hours each session. So one night, while walking out, he turned his head and smiled at me, then left. That happened once more after that night, but all I could do was just to smile back, nothing really happened. Since then, nothing really happened, maybe because I don’t usually talk or look at people at the gym, I might appear to be uninterested. It’s been a while, and I think it’s way pass the point of talking to each other. 

A few days ago, I saw him again, he was doing chest workout, but it was out of form, I wanted to go show him how to do it properly and as an excuse to talk to him, but I thought it’d be rude to tell people what to do in the gym, so I did nothing.
What should I do?"
12,"My brother (16) came out to me earlier, what should I (20M) be doing to help him right now


Hi guys. Not sure if this is needed, but family background; I have two older sisters (technically half sisters, but we never use that term) and two younger brothers. My brothers are 17 (turning 18 next month) and a recently turned 16yo. I’m home from college for the summer. 

Earlier today my youngest brother asked if he could speak to me, but he didn’t want to do it at home. It was clear something serious was happening, so I said sure, and we went for a drive. He told me he didn’t want to talk while I was driving, so eventually I pulled into McDonald’s gas station. He started to talk, at first a little tears eyed, and then full on crying. I haven’t seen him cry in years. 

Eventually he says he thinks he’s gay. Which, not to be cliche, was a fucking relief because I thought something terrible had happened to him, so I’m glad it wasn’t anything bad. But still, he was sobbing. I went round to him gave him a hug and told him that it’s ok. Eventually he stopped crying, we talked for a while. I learned I’m the only person he has told so far. He wants to tell our 18yo brother ‘Nick’, who is his best friend, before Nick goes off to college, but is worried that Nick won’t accept him. I know for a fact that Nick will accept him, because Nick asked me for advice when he began to think our brother might be gay last year - Nick was clear that he would be supportive. 

Seeing my little brother full on sobbing this afternoon has really worried me. I’ve read that coming out is a big step and can be scary, but he looked petrified. How do I best go about supporting him now. Right now, more anything I want him to know that he’s accepted and loved and nothing will change. I’m also really worried that maybe he isn’t really ready to accept himself yet - is there anything I can do to help on that front? 

He mentioned a couple times wanting to tell Nick, but being worried that it’ll change things between them. I told him that I was sure Nick would never change their relationship - but I didn’t tell him why I was sure. And I don’t think I can - because I promised both of them that I would mention it. I think my little brother could also use Nick’s support right now, should I encourage him to tell Nicknsooner rather than later? 

Thanks for the help!"
13,"Finally came out to my friends!


So, me and few of my closest friends went out to grab a drink last weekend. After drinking and talking for a while I decided I should finally come out. I’ve been waiting for the longest time and just said ‘fuck it’. 

One of the friends told me a while ago that she thought I was gay the first time she met me so I decided to bring the subject up by asking another friend if he also thought that way when we met. He said he did at first but then changed his mind. So I told him “you shouldn’t have changed your mind”

He then asked “what does it supposed to mean?”, I didn’t answer that question and smiled awkwardly lol.
He eventually asked me “are you gay?”, I nodded and they were all cool about it. Some of them said they knew cause I gave signs the last few weeks and didn’t say anything cause they didn’t want to push me.

I’m so glad I finally let that out, I feel so relieved!"
14,"I came out to my Chinese dad and his reaction was not what I expected.


With traditional Chinese dads who are conservative as fuck, you'd expect them to be yelling at you and giving you non-stop lectures about why your attraction to men is considered bad, nasty, a disgrace to the ancestors, and blah blah blah. You know, like the type of shit you typically hear. But fortunately... that wasn't how my dad reacted.

Last night out of the blue, I had this compelling urge to come out to my dad when he comes home from work. Mind you, he works long hours and doesn't come home until 2 AM, therefore I was waiting my ass off for what felt like forever! In fact, I've been wanting to tell him for years now but never had the guts. I just knew I had to tell him now because if I keep hiding it, then I'll probably never would. Also, it's sad to imagine sitting beside my beloving dad next to his deathbed knowing that I've never told him I was gay. That mere thought hurts me... y'know? In my mind, it's either NOW or NEVER.

Being the courageous Chinese son of a single Chinese father, I stirred up enough courage to finally let loose. By the time I heard the garage door opening, I stormed downstairs and waited by the door until my dad came in. He opened the door and saw me, which startled him. He asked me ""Wtf are you doing standing at the door like that at this fucking time?"". In that moment, I knew it was probably a bad idea to begin with... but since I already made a gutsy move to come out, there's no going back. Next thing I know, I told my dad to sit down for a sec because I needed to tell him something urgent no matter how inconvenient the time was. He was like ""At this time? Come on dude, I'm tired from work. Let the old man rest."" However, after several minutes of pestering him, he finally gave in with my demands.

I was like ""Dad... I'm gay. I don't know any other way to describe it other than the fact I have a strong preference for dick"" His reaction? His jaw dropped and then he started breaking down in tears, telling me that he's been keeping a secret from me for so long and that he's also gay. He made mom prego without any sexual attraction to her. And well, that's how I arrived into this world. My dad then gave me a looooong ass bear hug whilst continuing to weep and cry on my shoulder. It... it was an emotional night indeed. Of course, my dad and I slept on the same bed on that very night hugging each other to sleep."

16,"Feeling proud to have gone to bathhouse.


So I went to a sex party at a bathhouse this past weekend. A little bit of background; I was born to an absent, aloholic father and a narcisstic, homophobic mother so... good times. I've carried tons of shame and guilt for being gay and generally for just being me due to the constant threat of emotional and physical abuse I had to endure as a kid. 4 years of therapy later and at 31 I can finally say I'm getting comfortable in my own skin. 

&amp;#x200B;

I was really nervous going, but I had challenged myself to face this fear head-on and simply trust that the universe has my back--and it did! 98.9% of the guys were old, flabby and small. I think I was the only one there younger than 35 so I ended up making a spa day of it by sipping on some pinot and hanging in the hot tub.

&amp;#x200B;

Even though I didn't get any action, the fact that I went made me feel proud of myself."

18,"(Coming out backlash) If you have a strong feeling that your family won’t be accepting of you as gay, wait until you’re independent and then let it all out


I’m 25, gay and I’m glad to be financially independent. I came out to my dad last month and he was kinda ok with it, but he begged me to not flaunt about it so that our religious relatives wouldn’t bother him, which is understandable. My mom broke down in tears all day when she knew and later she texted me “please change for me otherwise I can’t love you”. My two sisters were so hateful. My older sister started babbling about how being gay is against nature and that my mom would die because of me. My little sister expressed that I’m a “disgusting pervert”.

It hurt a little, but I’ve endured a lot of hatred in my life, so I was ready to lash back at them.  I said to my older sister, “you’re a whore who has offered her pussy to sleep (marry) with two desperate men just for their money and look at you now, you’re a 40 year old divorced jobless worthless uneducated bitch who contributes nothing to society”. As for my little sister, I said to her, “you’re a morbidly obese 17 year old who eats junk food nonstop and is anti-social, no wonder why you’re getting bullied at school, you stupid cow, I can’t wait for the time you become a bigger failure than your older sister”. As for my mom, I told her, “you think I care whether you love me, you fat obnoxious religious zealot? Remember when the Orlando mass shooting happened and you didn’t express any remorse? You’re a merciless horrible hag and I don’t care whether you love me or not.”

When your family is hateful to you for being who you are, that’s how coming out should be. I’m a nice person, but when I encounter hatred, I know very well how to reciprocate it."
19,"If we say we don’t like something in bed then don’t do it


That’s right. Don’t do it. If we say we don’t like it and it doesn’t work for us, DO NOT DO IT! You’re not going to be that miracle guy with special skills that can convince us to like it. If I say I don’t like being fingered, do not finger me. It kills the vibe instantly for me. It feels like you’re probing me as if I got abducted by aliens. Just don’t do it. Listen and respect what I say, and I will respect you. 

That is all."
