0,"Is being an amazing match less emphasized in gay relationships than straight ones?


As a young gay (bi technically) person I was just wondering how the concept of being a ""match"" is treated in gay relationships. Since the dating pool is obviously smaller, is it less stressed or equally as much as it is for straight people do you think? How important is it to work great with each other as opposed to just good for you? Does the size of your dating pool affect how picky you are?"
1,"This is me (Part 2)


Hi,

I posted on here for the very first time several months ago (For reference, this is my old post: https://www.reddit.com/r/askgaybros/comments/7u3y0s/this_is_me/. Since then, I’ve posted on one other subreddits, and read up on all the postings on this one. But I’m going through some hard times, and it seems like all hope is lost. I don’t have anyone to talk to, so I would appreciate any advice.

I graduated last May, and I actually got a job that started in September in Houston, TX. Everything seemed to be going well. For a while though. I got fired on December 17. It seemed like I was struggling in my role, and they decided to part ways. On New Years Eve, I got into a car crash that was entirely my fault. I’ve been applying to jobs, but it all feels hopeless. I’ve started cutting myself as a result. 

I did come out to my oldest friend that I’ve known since 6th grade (we were both 12, and I’m now 24). It feels so simple to just give up and end it all. But I know I need to try to give life another shot. I don’t know what it’s like to be gay. I’m too shy to even approach a guy I like. And I don’t look attractive. I’m Asian. I’ve read enough on this subreddit to know that I don’t have a chance, so I just want a friend or someone to talk to.

Please, give me advice. On searching for jobs. On how to stop feeling hopeless. On how to be gay.

2,"Something I've always thought was odd about Brazil and the lgbt community there ?


It could be me but, for years something that seemed like on the one hand Brazil seems very homophobic and macho, but on the other hand has a very large lgbt community. Like I get the impression that rio de jainero has a lot of macho poor violent people, but one of the highest % of lgbt people in the world. Why is this ? Do you think it's all over for the lgbt people there after the election ?"

5,"Am I just not built to have good anal sex?


Fellow bottom bros, am I the only one who hasn't been able to enjoy the anal sex part?

I'm not the most experienced guy but I have taken enough dick to form some opinions about it and I slowly come to the conclusion that while my mind is definitely ready to bottom and enjoys it, my body apparently can't handle it.

Everytime I do anal, I go soft, regardless of how hot the guy is. Whatever position, whatever amount of lube, whatever the dick size.

Even the first finger insertion already feels weird, I usually panic and tense up because i have little control over the finger movement.
Same goes with something like a pen I insert by myself. I can't hold an erection for more than a minute after insertion and have to take it out and distract myself.

I usually just go through with the pain, either by just shuting up or by ignoring the pain and being soft because I personally like to please a top and have a very bottom mindset but it bugs me a little that my body apparently just doesn't want to cooperate.

I also have stomach aches almost always after giving it a try, am very bloated and often have runny shit afterwards. The pain and runny shit go away soon but still.
In some cases I even got bloody shits because the top probably got too rough.
It goes away after a day or so but the day after anal is full of liquid shits, stomach pain, hole soreness and shitty farts.

Also the cleaning and prep process isn't as fun either. I have rarely used anal douches because I didn't want to ruin my intestine flora but I instead just try to not eat for the day and shit and clean out as much as possible using regular methods. But for some reason, my body does what it wants and I have had ""accidents"" which lead to very embarrassing and uncomfortable exchanges. with tops who just decided to stop.

Am I the only one with this struggle of being a total bottom without the body willing to go along?"

7,"Not sure if he's telling me the truth he is straight!


This maybe long but I want an opinion on this situation and someone to tell me what I should.

&amp;#x200B;

I met a guy in 2017, his name is Jack, he's 25 like me. He lives 2 hours away from me and works at a hotel. The hotel in question I have been staying at for years. I came across him in my last few days of my holiday in December, he started a fire in the dining room at the fireplace and when he left I went over and took a photo as it looked amazing at Christmas time, I turned around and he was standing looking at me with a big smile on his face and he said to me 'admiring my work are we'?  I said how impressive it was and we chatted for a few minutes. He was the new barman and he is was my type and fit as hell.

&amp;#x200B;

Months went by and I forgot about him and didn't think of him again until I returned to this hotel again in the summer, this time I was staying with my two older brothers and mother. I thought about Jack two weeks before we were going back wondering if he was still working there. We were staying at the hotel again for two weeks. When we arrived I came across Jack as I was walking by the stairs and there was no acknowledgement. It had been 6 months and I thought maybe he forgot about us, it is the hospitality industry after all so many folk coming through. Days later we passed by the bar and Jack acknowledged me , saying back again. For the rest of the time Jack kept investing all his time on me and not my family. He would ask me how my day was going, and how my day was so far every time I passed the bar! One lunch time, I was dining with my family and Jack was our waiter, Jack handed my plate to me and as I looked up he gave me this really intense eye contact and didn't stop looking and smiling, he didn't do this with my family and just put their plates down. On the day we were leaving, Luke didn't seem happy, he was behind the bar looking glum. As the manager got our cases out I turned round and saw Luke watching me , i smiled and he abruptly moved around the bar where he couldn't be seen, I stood at the bar when Luke started serving a young attractive girl. I was waiting to give him my key , as he was serving her, she kept talking to him and he was focused on me , looking at the side of the bar! He came over and took my key, he said did I want a drink before I set off and I said I had a train to catch. 

&amp;#x200B;

I found Luke on Facebook and he accepted my friend request, i thanked him for the offer of a drink before going and said I hopefully would see him again in December, he replied back with 'You're more than welcome' , i said about the drink and I was sorry to decline it and he replied back with, 'Ah, ok, not to worry, and hopefully he would see me around soon'.

&amp;#x200B;

Two weeks before I went back in December I decided to remove Luke from Facebook, this was because I knew my feelings were getting stronger and stronger, he was all I could think about. I decided to give him a wide-berth at the hotel and decided to ignore him every chance I could. The first night I arrived, Luke was behind the bar and I walked up the stairs, my brother saw Luke and said Hello and when i turned around I didn't say a thing and went to my room, I decided to avoid the bar so my brother got the drinks in at night and bring them to my room. On the 10th night of 14 at the hotel, my brother came to the family room and told us how a young girl had served him, he said someone started rubbing his shoulder in a jokey, creepy way and was surprised to see it was Luke rubbing his shoulder, my brother is straight and came into the room elated by this, for some reason it affected me and by the night time I started getting upset to the point of crying in my bed. :( 

&amp;#x200B;

The following morning i got online and wrote a review for the hotel on trip advisor , it was all positive but as theres 14 members of staff I mentioned them all but Luke. This was to make a point, long story short the review was published the following night and I was at the hotel for a further 2 nights. I came in from a night out and Luke approached my brother and said he wasn't mentioned in the review and that he was also removed from my Facebook and didn't know why. My first thought was why would you care that a guest removed you from Facebook? He has 4,000 + friends and yet he noticed I removed him.

&amp;#x200B;

That night I apologised on Facebook to Luke, and his first question was why I removed him? I wasn't honest and gave an excuse that it was a accident. We started chatting again and things carried on as normal. I added him on Facebook again!

&amp;#x200B;

The next night I returned to the hotel with my mother, Luke started chatting to us at the bar, well mainly me. He ignored my mother and asked me what TV shows I was interested in and what movies, really invested. 

That night I told my mother how I felt about Luke, that the feelings were really strong and had been for over a year.

She said maybe he was Bi or Gay and there might be something there and she would keep an eye out for things.

&amp;#x200B;

The next night, i came back from a night out with my mother, I walked through the door and Luke was serving a customer , bar was full of people waiting to be served. Luke working alone, he clocked me walking in, he started rushing this customer, he grabbed the change and rushed to the till, my mother was behind me and saw Luke acting this way, he then left the bar unattended and walked to the stairs where by the time I reached the top I turned around and saw Luke at the bottom and he was just standing there looking up at me. My mother thought this was highly unusual. 

&amp;#x200B;

The same night, I went to the bar with my brother, 3 guys were serving by 9.30pm. Luke chose to serve us, he remembered our drinks order from memory and started looking at me again, he picked up 4 glasses and started juggling them, keeping his focus on my response and keeping eye contact. He said he had never dropped one yet. 

After the drinks were paid for, Luke made it abundantly clear that he would be at the family room at 9pm, a service the hotel provides is an evening tea tray, Luke looked at me when he said this like he wanted to see me. 9pm hit and he was there, I opened the door and he was standing there, with a big smile. He handed the tray over and as I turned around to walk in , i went to grab the handle and Luke was up my back, really really close this was unusual to me. 

&amp;#x200B;

I then that night went online to investigate his profile, ''interested in women'', this was a shock considering how he has been with me over my visits. I checked his 'Life events' , 2013 engaged, 2014 married and 2015 in a relationship.

He tagged these girls too , the girl from 2013 and the girl from 2014 were friends of Luke, and in his comments they both stated it was a joke, that they weren't going out with him, the girl from 2015 had no photos of them together and neither did Luke. Strange, I kept thinking maybe these were on his profile to hide his sexuality, who tags people in relationships when you haven't dated them? 

&amp;#x200B;

from 2011 to 2019, many friends seem to  have questioned his sexuality over the years and he's hardly had any relationships. Only relationship I can see he had was way back in 2012 with a girl and two photos on instagram.

&amp;#x200B;

Luke always worked at 5pm , he is a barman and was never required by the hotel to be at work any earlier, my mother told me the night before going home that if Luke was at the hotel in the morning, he must have feelings for me.

Well 8am came and as I walked down the stairs Luke was behind the bar, two girls were serving at breakfast and Luke was at work that early for what reason who knows. My heart was pounding out of my chest because I was worried I wouldn't see him before I left. 

&amp;#x200B;

With two hours left before I was to leave, My mother told me to stay behind and speak to Luke at the bar.

I came down with a Christmas card and we started chatting, he was telling me about his plans for Christmas

and told me he had never visited where I lived, he said if he did it would be with a 'future girlfriend'. The penny dropped

why Luke was saying this, he started on another subject but I was feeling crap, I made my excuses and hastily made my exit . 

When I left the hotel, I kept thinking of the conversation over and over again and something didn't make sense to me. Throughout our conversation he always looked and made eye contact , until he said future girlfriend, he didn't look at me but the bar windows, effectively looking straight ahead and his voice trembled at girlfriend. It made me wonder, was he interested in me but had never come across this experience with a guy before? He's only 25! Why was he so close to me the night before when giving me the tea-tray?, why did he care when I removed him off Facebook and why does he look at me so evidently every time I come into the hotel? And why was he at work the morning I was leaving when he never did during the remaining 13 nights of my stay? 

&amp;#x200B;

We left the hotel right after , I decided to message Luke on Facebook from the station and said did he mention a future girlfriend because he was straight and wanting to make it clear, he replied with 'Correct Mate', he told me he would see me next year. 

&amp;#x200B;

The card I left Luke, told him when i was returning to the hotel summer 2019, he messaged me Christmas day and said he would still be at the hotel come the summer, I wrote a note to him on wrapping paper as the card was too small. He said it was a nice and thoughtful touch and then expressed that I was his favourite! He then told me to excuse his spelling and punctuation because he got a D in English, something I noted which was cute but wondered why would he be concerned about me judging him. He messaged me again in the new year and told me about his future career plans and how he wants a promotion and to further excel in the future. Quite personal bits of information that I assume you wouldn't tell just a guest.

&amp;#x200B;

Long story short I need opinions, is this guy into me. Is it possible. It's this guys birthday soon and I wonder if I should get him something to make sure I'm in his mind but not sure. Any advice welcome. Thanks

Hey bros. I've been looking all over and am a bit confused. I weigh 205 lbs atm but I wanna slim down to maybe 180. I'm pretty beefy (somewhat muscular) but with that comes  a bit of fat on my tummy. I want to lose weight but rarely have time for the gym since it's usually work, then sleep, then work again (the tragedy). My question is what should I be eating during my breaks at work?

10,"Older men in clubs tend to be a lot more forward and make advances on me. Why is this?


22 year old here. I know it sounds like a stupid question, but older men tend to be the ones who will stare at me and make me feel like prey whenever I walk in the club. They also are the only ones who will ever actively do things like grab my ass if I'm just trying to pass through, etc.

I mean, it makes me a little uncomfortable, I won't lie. Sometimes a good ""no thank you"" isn't enough so I have to keep moving away from them.

Its not just the ""creep"" factor -- I try to overlook that feeling if someone just makes comments like ""I think you are attractive"" or if someone just wants a quick dance, and then I can walk away. Hey, a man can try, I'm cool with that even if I don't personally like them. But after I say no, please, just go.

&amp;#x200B;

Anyway, the original question: Why are older men the only ones who seem to do this to me, never younger guys?"

My boss is a Married guy late 40s has teenage kids . I ran into him in the city on the way to a meeting and he sent me an work email just catching up and asking about Christmas.
Told him about going to my boyfriends family's place for lunch and stuff. He replied that he didn't know I was gay and I could text him on this number if I preferred. I was kind of busy and didn't reply straight away and he sent me a don't worry about it kind of message. Not wanting to be rude I messaged him back and chatted for a bit.
He asked if it was okay to ask some questions about being gay and I said ask away no dramas. Over the course of many questions it became very apparent to me that he is a closeted gay guy or maybe just bi. I kind of had to pull him up a bit because he asked a few leading questions like did I think he was attractive and had I ever hooked up with a Married man.
He got a bit sheepish after that and thanked me for my time and apologised if he gave the wrong impression. I said no worries mate, hit me up if you need a friend  to talk to.
I didn't hear from him again until yesterday when work started up again. Saying how he has been stressed and not sleeping well along with a bunch more general gay sex  questions. I told him I'd keep his secret and would be happy to chat with him if he needed. 

My question to you is. What should I do?  Should I encourage him to follow a gay lifestyle?  Should I not enable him by talking with him about stuff? I haven't brought up his wife and family, should I?  Have any of you been in my or my boss' situation before? How did you handle it? "
14,"Had the most ""something"" dream


Okay, imagine if all tolerance and acceptance was force on to people. So in this dream, America was taken over by a dictator but he wasn't trying to rule over and start war, he instead tries to help America become a peaceful country. He knew that some people will always give hate, and he wanted to end it for good. So for that, every man, woman and teen would ordered by law to wear a collar that has a built-in video camera and microphone to record the person's perspective and a bracelet that senses vibration to record daily movement. If you ever said or do anything offensive to a certain type of person, it would cause you to get arrested. And the collar and bracelet would be total proof you did it.

Would you be scared of that?"

The last 2 guys I met up through ""Grindr"" (seriously, that trashy hookup app),  felt like they were sizing me up if I was successful enough for them. One guy brought up if I was driving the elegant Jeep outside the restaurant we were dining at (and he brought it up randomly). Then, when I was driving him to drop off in my Civic (which didn't impressed him I bet), he brought up my shoes and how ""nice"" were they. 

The other guy I met up with was a little more tame (or probably I knew what possibly could come). But he did bring up career and stuff, which I think was okay if it was general dating -- but this was from Grindr. "
