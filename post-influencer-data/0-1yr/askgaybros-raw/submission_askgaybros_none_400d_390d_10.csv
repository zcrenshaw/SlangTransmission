0,"Seriously what the fuck Grindr, are condoms really that bad?!


I’m starting to get really fucking pissed off at how often the conversation ends when I say I only use condoms.

Yes, I’m on prep, NO I’m not going to fuck you bareback. 


Is this a common issue for everyone else too? I swear this is happening with 70% of the guys I talk to. "
1,"Looking back, I have no idea how I was watching gay porn for two years without admitting to myself that I'm indeed gay.


Can anybody relate to this?"
2,"Random male conventionally attractive celebrity is hot


Now give me upvotes because I validated everyones tastes"
3,"Anyone else masturbate because they're bored and not because they're horny?


I'm 16 so I'm apparently supposed to have a  high ""sex drive"" aka horniness. I get sexually aroused but never horny anymore. I can't remember the last time I masturbated because I was actually horny (At least over a year). When I have nothing to do, I just masturbate. I do it daily. I used to be so horny at ages 13-14. So horny I wanted to become a porn star when I grew up. Anyone else the same way?"
4,"I just saw the hottest fucking guy...


Blonde hair, muscular as shit hairy, huge bulge and perky ass. So hot.

  


  


Then I noticed the socks and sandals.

  


Yep. The hot ones are always dumb."
5,"Just passed a note to a cute guy


That was pretty damn nerve-wracking, at least in the moments right before I passed it. But basically the note said that I think he's really cute and seems like a cool guy, and I write down my Snapchat name and my number and a few other things. I have no idea if he's gay or not though. We've been on nodding terms and we usually smile to each other, which rarely happens among strangers where I live lol. 

Let's hope for the best. I'm still happy that I found the courage to do it!"
6,"Manscaping My Straight Friend


So....my best straight (completely straight) friend of 10 years is totally cool with me being gay...

He mentioned he needed to manscape and I somewhat jokingly said I would do it for him...he said “ok”

And now this is a routine thing....I feel it is slightly sexual and am oddly turned on by it.  He strips down and I trim away, grabbing and moving his naughty bits as necessary. 

I even googled if guys ever groom each other and that doesn’t seem to exist on the internet lol. 

Thoughts?"
7,"My boyfriend of 2+ years just told me that he doesn’t love me and never truly got over his ex. He apologised for hurting me and asked me to move out so he can get back in contact with his ex. I appreciate his honesty but I’m in shock and still trying to process what’s happened.

8,"just got called a ""danger twink"" during sex, whats the weirdest thing you've been called?


so this guy from high school randomly hit me up and I guess hes newly out and inexperienced. I went over on my lunch break from work and he told me all about how he dirty talks girls and how they beg him to ""pound"" them so I was like ok lets see what ur all about. I guess hes new to gay terms like twink so as hes going at it on my ass he goes ""ya you like that you danger twink"" like completely serious. I burst out laughing and literally had to compose myself and couldn't even finish because of how absurd the situation was. Whats the weirdest thing you guys have been called?"
9,"My father saw gay porn on my phone and he acted like nothing happened


I opened gay xvideo on my phone. Then I leaved the room to get some water but forgot to turn the screen off. When i went back to the room i saw him in my room finding stuffs. Then he left the room without saying anything. I think he is not mad at me, he just gave me some cash to buy food

10,"Outted in the worst way UPDATE


Original post: https://www.reddit.com/r/askgaybros/comments/92pcii/outted_in_the_worst_fucking_way_possible_and/

If you didn't read it before, the tl;dr is that my parents, who had no idea that I was gay, walked in on me being spitroast by my bf and our roommate.

Before I get to the update, I wanted to address a few things. I got a lot of supportive messages, and thanks to those who pmed me. To those who don't believe this happened, I can't convince you, but it felt pretty fucking real to me. Especially the last two weeks. 

Update:

I tried calling my parents for a few days straight but they didn't pick up. The whole time I just felt sick, but my boyfriend and roommate were pretty helpful. We had some long talks about how they came out, I thought of what to say, and overall they were nice. Really needed it. 

Middle of last week I finally got through to my mom. She didn't say much other than hello at the beginning, but I told her I was gay and that I was sorry she had to learn it that way. I could definitely tell she was heart broken but she stayed on the phone. Eventually she just kept asking why, which then turned into, I was obviously being used by some older guys (boyfriend is a class up), to I'm confused and must be taking my break up really hard. 

After about an hour she said that I'll have to pay for the summer housing. I'm staying with my boyfriend but still paying for things, so they cut me off on that since I'm ""being perverted"" there and they won't have it. It was really hard to hear that from her but I get where she's coming from. We kinda wrapped things up after that since it was awkward with her saying that I was basically using the summer as a time to be perverted and act like that. 

The next day my dad called. I almost started crying just seeing his name on my phone. Someone on the old thread said that I have some internalized homophobia because I feel like I disappointed my dad by being gay. Maybe. But he called and said what my mom said about the living expenses, they're not cutting me off for college tuition, but I need to learn to handle myself or something. I could tell the entire time he was just sad and mad about the whole thing. At the end I told him that I was sorry and I loved him and he just said good bye. That hurt. 

Came out officially to others after that because whatever. My friends were so much more supportive, which helped me get through this with my parents. My ex girlfriend messaged me and told me to basically fuck off though, which was kind of funny. 

Last night I talked with both of my parents and they still said they don't understand why I'm doing this or how this guy convinced me to do the things I did, but told me to be safe. Still haven't heard the L word yet, but be safe is pretty good. But they do still sound sad when they talk to me. 

Thanks bros. I'm off to be gay because now I can just be that without worrying about things. I feel as though a weight has lifted, but if I think about my parents I just still feel a lot of disappointed and like I'm failing them. Apparently my mom has just been crying for the past week and it hurts to know that.  I guess I just have to try and be happy... and hopefully everyone can block out that memory. "
11,"My gay porn preference is just watching guys robbing a bank instead of actually having sex


I like it when they capture the golden coins and elude the policeman. DAE?"
12,"The bottom-fairy has finally blessed me


I met a guy on Grindr who I invited over multiple times before, but we had only done things that involved oral and the most anal we had ever done was me fingering him. I had never really gave him the clue that I was into giving bottoming a try. 

He is a very cute guy. He's 19 and I'm 22. He just graduated high school and turned 19 and is ready to start college. He comes from a Hispanic family and he's told me that they are extremely strict and very homophobic. He's not out to anybody. Not even his friends. Most of the sex he had ever had was with girls. However, he definitely knows what he wants. He's very aggressive when we do sexual things like pinning me to the bed, grabbing my hair, and he even bites me. All of that is what really made me think about bottoming in the first place. 

I spent a couple days practicing with a dildo that I had bought forever ago but hadn't really used much (to tell you the truth, the thing really just hurt and I didn't want to buy a new one). Every time I had used the dildo, it was a struggle getting it to feel good. A lot of times to no avail. I had tried bottoming before, but I hadn't prepped and  it hurt too much for me to keep going. I had never had a *full* bottoming experience. 

I told him I was down to bottom and he came over last night. We had started the night with cuddling and making out, but then things finally escalated. I had decided to let him use my dildo on me which felt a little better with him controlling it. Finally he told me he was ready and I gave him a condom and made sure I was plenty lubed up. Ive heard a lot of people on this sub say that missionary is the best way to get fucked and him hit the prostate. He was able to slight his dick right in, and immediately it soooo much better than a dildo. One of the things that I had not read about on this sub was how good it feels for someone else to touch your ass area (especially with a dick). With dildos, they're just so, idk, lifeless. However, with his dick, it actually feels like it's alive. You can feel it twitch and throb. 

So yes gay bros. I had a bottoming experience and it felt good. There's no magic to it at all. Just practicing putting things in your ass, and dicks will take care of the rest! 10/10!!!"
13,"Just came clean about my feelings for guy I’ve known since high school who I don’t even know is gay...


I’ve been out for about 5 years (23 now) and I recently decided to message a guy I’ve been into since high school. 

I’ve known him for a while and I don’t even know if he’s gay but my drunk ass thought it would be a good idea to confess my feelings for him. 

I dm’d him on Snapchat and he has yet to open it. Idk how to feel or what to do. I’m a risk taker by nature and impulsive as fuck. We’ve talked before and I always get the vibe he’s flirting which just confuses me more. 

I just feel so lost. I terrible at navigating the intricacies of gay culture. I like this guy a lot but I feel like I probably fucked it up. Has anyone done anything similar to this or am I just a special kind of stupid? 


PS. If you’re gonna just tear into me... just don’t. I genuinely only post to this reddit because I don’t have a solid connection to the gay community and this forum makes me feel less like a pariah. So please just let me feel like I’m loved and accepted for like 2 minutes of my miserable existence. "

15,"I sounded like an idiot when a cute guy at the gym talked to me


We were both on benches next to each other and I tried to start my set while he was in the middle of his, but the benches were too close to each other so I stopped after 1 rep, and was gonna move it, but he finished his and got up and asked if he should move it. I literally couldn't talk and stuttered some incomprehensible sentence, but he just said ""you know what, I'm just gonna move mine."" Time in between sets is supposed to be zoning out looking at the floor thinking about absolutely nothing, not mentally slapping myself for acting like an idiot 😔"
16,"I always thought I was straight but gay sex is too much fun and I can't go back. NSFW


Probably been posted here a bunch but I am in my early twenties and have been trying out new stuff. Before hand I had always dated women but now that I think about it, I always found sex to be just meh. For example yeah it was great to lay back and get good head and it felt good having sex. But I wasn't ranting and raving about it like my friends. 

Now a few months ago I was not dating any girls at the time and this guy was obviously hitting on me pretty hard at this bar. Honestly it was kind of funny and I am the type to be very nice and respectful. I can't remember exactly what happened but he ended up giving me a slip of paper with his number. I really can't pinpoint exactly what made me do it, it was almost like instinctual reaction but I texted him a few days later. Via text I told him I have zero experience and he said its cool to take it slow. 

After some very awkward first experiences I find he is more of a dominate type which makes things easy for me. Now a couple months later we hook up like 4-5 times a week. I have ready about a ""slut"" phase and maybe I am in that because I really loose control with him. Sex now isn't just ""meh"" its the most fun I have had. Even though it took a while to learn to bottom well its the best. Our go to is me on my back on the edge of the bed while he stands. The angle hits me just right and I always orgasm without touching myself. At first I was not so into giving head but its has grown on me. I find it to be a lot more fun going down on a guy then a girl. Dick is just easier and more the play with. 

Even though we don't go on dates or anything I am finding this to be insanely fun new and exciting. It honestly scares me sometimes that I often don't think of straight sex any more.
