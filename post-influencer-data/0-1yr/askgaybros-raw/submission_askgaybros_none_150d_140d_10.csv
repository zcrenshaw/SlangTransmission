0,"My Grindr hookup showed up and my landlord mistakenly sucked his dick for HIS Grindr hookup


This is possibly the wildest night of my life and I’m still laughing uncontrollably as I type this. I scheduled to meet with a dude I met on Grindr (Kyle) over the weekend and we had only shared one pic. I guess over the weekend, he catches amnesia or something and completely forgets how I look. Fast forward to 9:30pm and Kyle texts me that he’s at the door. I opened the door, didn’t see anyone, and he had also completely ghosted me on text. I was sure at the moment I just got punk’d. 

He calls me 2 min later and here’s when I get the climactic run down. So he showed up and my LANDLORD (who I didn’t know was gay) opens the door and asks him “Grindr?” in which he automatically assumed was me. The greatest part of this is that I’m 6’1 and my landlord is 5’5, and he also just assumed he got cat-fished. Back to the story, my landlord gets naked and proceeds to suck this dude’s dick. 5 seconds into the bj he feels super uneasy and I guess somehow his memory kicks in and then he goes “wait, are you Joe?”.  And that was the exact moment Kyle knew he done fucked up. 

Dudes, what are the god damn chances that my landlord schedules a Grindr hookup on the exact day AND time as me?? I’m still grinding my teeth at how cringe this wicked night was. 

Btw, Kyle devoured my ass and I came twice so that was cool."
1,"For a community that preaches about love and inclusiveness, the gay community can be pretty trash at it.


Just hear me out. We hear and see it all the time. Shit like “ no fems, no blacks, no Asians, no Latinos, no fat, masc only” all this bullshit. We get pissy when straight people discriminate against us because we’re gay but if another gay person is a darker shade or a little heavier or a little more feminine then it’s ok to just treat them like they don’t belong in the community. “Oh it’s just my personal preference” isn’t a valid excuse because what people don’t realize is it stops being a preference when you actively start treating the other person completely differently over something that they might have no control over. We as a community need to either step the fuck up or shut the fuck up because if we can’t treat each other with respect and love and inclusion then how and the hell can we expect the rest of the world to accept us. 
Rant over *drops mic*"
2,"I don't know why but I found this so cute and a turn on.


A best friend and I who have this ""situationship"" and in love with each other did a hiking trip this past weekend. Nothing sexual happened between us but we had a blast event though at the moment are just friends. We spent some great quality time together hiking. It was a great bonding moment.  

Since we would be outdoors a lot, I brought my baseball cap in case the sun was too much. On the last day of our trip, when we headed out to breakfast, he grabbed my baseball cap and put it on. I teased him about it saying how he didn't have permission to use my hat, he laughed and kept it on from there on out. In my three years of knowing him he has never worn a baseball cap, and I see him almost weekly. 

After the hiking the first trail that morning, I started to realize how cute he looked in my hat. I straight up told him ""You know, you can keep my hat, it's all your's. You look even cuter in it than you already are."" When I said that he blushed and got so red and you could tell that it meant a lot to him. Soon after that, while we were driving the rental car on the way to the airport, he starting singing his heart out (he normally doesn't like to sing) and he seemed like he was on cloud nine, and kept playing with the baseball cap, touching it while on his head. But the cutest part is from then on he kept the hat on for rest of the day, even on the plane, in our taxi. It was like he was wearing it with pride. 

I dunno, it sounds so silly, but something so simple like that, just brought this interesting dynamic to the amazing relationship we already have. It's silly because it's just a hat, but I feel in a way it symbolizes something. 

Anyone have anything similar happen to them? Something so simple or basic, being a symbol of a dynamic between you and someone else romantically?"
3,"I tried to be happy being alone, so I went to a restaurant and sat in a booth myself and ordered a lot of food. The waitress got me a lemonade and said, ""I'm sorry hun, I don't think she's coming, but here's this one the house.""


So that was nice. How has your day been?"
4,"Guy used me to get back at his sisters in an extremely petty and explicit way


I was deceived in order to be included in petty revenge... AND I LOVED IT!

I (24M) am a gay guy of fairly loose morals. About two months ago, I met an equally morally relaxed guy (Buddy, 24M) and we've had multiple dates, all at my place since I live alone and he lives with his sisters.

A week ago, he asked me to come over to his place. The sisters would be visiting their parents and be gone for the weekend, so we can have the place to ourselves. We had a nice dinner together, a couple of drinks and things started heating up. Aka, we started fucking on the couch. The couch that's very clearly visible as soon as you walk in the house.

So we're reeeally going at it, and suddenly the front door opens and all three of Buddy's sisters walk in and start screaming. I quickly grab my clothes to spare the ladies the view but I start laughing so hard at their idiotic screaming that I can't pull on my pants. My dick's just flopping around (with the condom still hanging from it no less) and when I turn around, I see Buddy's just sitting there completely fucking naked on their leather couch. All this time, the sisters were losing their minds, one of them grabbed a decorative pillow and started hitting Buddy with it shouting at him to take his naked ass off the couch, and the other two kept screaming at me to get the fuck out or they'll call the police.

Finally, I managed to get dressed and as I sat in my car, Buddy showed up and asked if he can stay at my place. Back home he told me what all of that was really about. The sisters had actually gone to the theater and he knew they'd be back around 11. He basically wanted them to see him on all fours getting nailed by a man. Apparently, they're all homophobic bitches that have been trying to make his life hell ever since he came out 10 years ago. They tried to persuade their parents to send him off to the army when he was 18. They snoop around his room all the time, they throw away or take his stuff, for a long time they wouldn't let him use the internet at their place because they didn't want him looking at gay porn (he's not dumb, he found ways to use the internet and look at gay porn lol). The only reason he still lives with them is because their parents are paying the rent under the condition they all live together but he'll probably move away later this year because he has a better job lined up.

He was very sorry that he used me like that and apologized again and again and again, but I found it extremely funny and I'm not upset. I know some people would be upset at being seen naked by three people, but I figured they probably hadn't seen a dick in ages so I did them a favor.

Also, Buddy and I are a couple now. And maybe we ""christen"" other parts of the house before he moves out, who knows!"
5,"I got a splinter and the guy who was treating it


So at work i managed to somehow get a splinter in my thumb, so a colleague who is first-aid trained (from a different department) came to treat me in the staff room. Cute guy, he's said hey to me when we pass each other in the corridors but never really got to know each other.

The stinging was absolutely horrible, so I'm sitting at this table (and he's on his knees with a tweezer and a needle prick), and basically, his hand that wasn't holding the tweezer/needle was holding my hand (with the splintered thumb) on the table.

Being single, I've never experienced something like that but his hand was just so big and warm! And when I was flinching with pain (when he was trying to remove the splinter) he said in his very smooth voice ""hey you're gunna be fine :) promise"" and idk. It just made me feel very at ease and blushy.

I know theres a strong chance he's straight but just felt like sharing here anyway."
6,"Is anyone a dreamer, constantly playing scenes in your head of memories or events that didn't happen or wish to happen?


I am a dreamer, a deep thinker. Always picturing myself as a worry free, young and happy person enjoying it with someone I truly love. However, being stuck in my head reaching for unrealistic goals knowing l'll always be anxious or suffering from bad mental health, and the crippling limits I put on myself will always prevent me from living the life I so desperately wish I could live.   


And I might just not be good enough for anyone, the fear of being alone forever, which really brings me down. So I continue to play scenes in my head of things I wish to happen, to keep me having hope that maybe just maybe, things will be okay."
7,"My fiancé died


We were together for 9 years. He was my first and only love, we met when I was 19 and he was 21 at a party. We had the most amazing years together. I love him so much. We were going to get married, we were going to be so happy, with all our relatives and friends at the wedding. And then it happened. A fuckin drunk hit him with his car and he died on the spot. 











When they told me he died I didn't believe it at first I thought they were making some kind of crank call. And then when I realised it was true I went hysterical, I lost it. I was put on heavy meds and therapy. I am writing from a throw off account because I don't want anyone I know to read this. People think I am getting better but the truth is I am not. I feel as bad as the day he died. I have just learned to hide it. And scream on the inside not outside. I don't see a meaning in life anymore. I am depressed all the time. I don't feel like doing anything. I quit my job, started a new one recently. I try to make some changes to feel something, push myself to feel any other emotion besides sadness but it's not working.













The therapy is not working either. I have changed many therapists but it's the same. No matter what approach they use what they are saying is a load of crap and I can't take it seriously because it is something I don't believe in, it makes no difference to my situation. He is dead. Our life together is over. My future with him is over. Our happiness is destroyed. And there's nothing any of us can do about it, is there?
















 He is dead and he is not coming back. And I am alone. Without his love I am lost, without his beatiful laughter, his charming smile.. Why did he have to go? Why did it have to be him? Why couldn't that stupid drunk hit a wall and die? Why did he have to take my life, why did he have to take this young life, this man who was gonna do so much, he was going to achieve so much and now he is rotting in the ground. Where is God or the Universe or whatevet deity? Where? Why did they let this happen, why did he have to go away? I don't understand."
8,"Underage brother tried to meet with someone from a dating app, need advice


Hi everyone, first of all, I'm sorry if there's a more appropriate forum for this question. I thought that gay men might have better advice to offer about this situation than other groups.

Here's what happened: this weekend, my 13yo brother called me at work in tears. He wanted me to pick him up at a train station 2 hours away from our home. I was terrified and had no idea why he was there all by himself, but since he begged me not to tell our parents, I didn't.

I had to leave work early and found him at a store where I'd told him to wait. He was still obviously scared. He wouldn't tell me what had happened until we got home and could be alone in his room.

I had to pry words out of him, but eventually he told me his intention was to meet up with someone he's been chatting with on Grindr. I know that's an exclusively adult app (like most dating apps are) for gay guys. At least he didn't protest when I ordered him to delete it.

At first he told me this person was 16, then ""maybe 18 or 19"". He lied himself, claiming he was 18. Apparently, once they met, the other guy got mad at my brother for lying about his age and lashed out before leaving, which is why he was so upset when I found him.

He wouldn't tell me much else. Why he used the app in the first place, why he lied about his age, why he thought meeting with a stranger 2 hours away from home would be a good idea. His response to everything was to cry or say ""I don't know"" and promise he'll never do it again.

I don't know what to do. I did make him delete the app, but what's to stop him from using it again? I spend most of my time away at university or work, but even if I was at home, I couldn't monitor him 24/7. He doesn't want me to tell our parents he was meeting up with a guy.

I'd really appreciate some advice. I'm 18 myself and would be enraged if a 13yo kid tried to catfish me on Tinder, but then again, I don't want to yell at my brother for it. I believe he really is scared, but I don't know if he understands just how dangerous what he did could've proved both for him and the other guy.

Anyway… thanks for any help with this."
9,"As an HIV+ man : I just want to be loved


Hello guys,

I was recently diagnosed HIV+, and reading through some old posts on several subreddits, I noticed how much serosegregation, shame and stigma are still very much a thing.

So I just wanted to say : We are human just as much as you. We have feelings, we have hopes and dreams. And we want to be loved and live normal lives.

We may have made a mistake in the past, been raped, got cheated on, caught it during a procedure or on the job, but the fact is that we are now poz. 

So next time that you happen to meet a Poz guy on some dating app, or that this really cute boy you went on several dates with discloses his status, I only ask you to be kind and understanding. Just being able to put yourself out there again takes a huge load of courage and strength for some of us. Read about it, get some info, there are a lot of myths that are in need of debunking. There are a lot of solutions, and happy serodiscordant couples.

I am not asking you to do stuff you are not comfortable with. If HIV is something you cannot handle, you are in every right to move on. What I am asking you to do is to treat that man with respect and kindness. Do not ghost him, do not block him. Be upfront, be empathethic, and say that this cannot work for this or that reason. 

Some of us poz folks do not accept it. Some of us are angry, hopeless, and/or desperate. It is already hard to deal with that chronic illness ( which is no longer a death sentence ), please don't sprinkle salt on an open wound ! 

And PLEASE be safe to the best of your ability. Sometimes the virus will still find it's way despite all your efforts to keep it at bay, but do everything in your power to keep things under control.

Thank you for reading !"
10,"I was never a bottom and neither was my boyfriend


We've been together for a few years now, both in our thirties. That means that at the time we meet we were both sure about our identity. like most guys, we looked for partners we knew would be compatible with us but the connection between us was fast and it was too late to say sorry we won't work.


We tried hard finding pleasure with each other in other ways and it was all good but not ever enough, we both wanted more and we decided we would try and change things. 
And we tried hard, taking thing slowly, getting used to butt stuff/play, it was like bottoming for beginners. We both realized how we took our previous partners for ganted. Bottoming was not easy and it took months before both of us could successfully bottom without pain and actually feel only pleasure. He got there sooner and I was feeling a bit jealous if I'm honest. The way his body reacted to my dick like he was riding a wave that didn't end.
 

Now we're both here, many I think don't get so far. Incompatibility ends too many relationships. I see it so many times here, guys asking for advice on this same subject. Oney way you cant tackle this problem is trusting your partners even if you're afraid, even if you feel you're giving something up you never planned to. It can be worth it.
I love riding my boyfriend's dick as much as I love sliding into his warm heat and watch his face and body react."
11,"I asked a guy out today. Cheers, Gaybros.


Hey gaybros,

For perspective, I'm 23 and doing school, new to the gay life and took a chance today. 

I didn't wake up thinking... ""yeup, todays the day, Ill ask him"". Nope. Just my usual walk up some stairs to class- and saw this *handsome* redhead seated, studying with friends... 

Sat behind him in a sofachair and to my best gay-senses, knew he probably belonged to our wonderful, diverse club of bros. 

Listen, you ever feel that bottomless heart-pounding *shudder* in ya chest? Nervously, I write a little letter, throw digits in there, and get up for class. 

""Hey, I think you dropped this"". **Handoff complete**. I left the scene, watching my dignity get anchored in the chair I sat in seconds ago. 

I'll post updates. Don't worry fellas, I know yall like news."
12,"Anybody else love taking things kinda slow when dating a dude you really like?


So I just started seeing a this really cool dude and it's been really nice dating like normal people. First date we got a drink and things went really well, kissed each other good night. Second date he came over for pizza and movies and we made out a bit. Third date we met at a bar with friends and he spent the night and we banged. Maybe I shouldn't be this hyped about normal ass dating but it's been really nice getting to know this dude before we did the dirty"
13,"Who would have thought patience and a slow reveal would turn the tide? (Td:lr Changing a friend's mind)


Hi gay bros,
This is a little success story i wanna share with you because I've been working on it for quite a while and to see it come to fruition feels great!

[Background] So I'm [22M] in 2nd year medical school nearing its end. I have decided upon entering my first year that i want to be a little more open about myself although i didn't want to explicitly come out. So, insidiously, i increased my gay jokes among my friends, a little more physical here and there but nothing outside the fooling around area. Some people started asking questions, some didn't. Other classmates joke the same way so it was like whatever. I kept a fine line to make people suspect but never confirm. And in my culture no one REALLY asks if you're gay (because it's somewhat taboo still) but they do ask jokingly so i jokingly reply.

[Main] Around March of the first medical school year, i became friends with a classmate. Let's call him H. H wasn't a guy I'd wanted to be friends with. At distance, he was not my type of friends. But for some reason or another we had to share groups and discussions and we went out to celebrate after each exam together. I was a charismatic social butterfly nonetheless and even when i didn't fancy him a friend i still interacted as such.

One day, some of my friends in class and i were discussing religion and many opinions flared up. We're a heavy mix of christians (the many types), muslims and agnostics. H shows up late to the conversation, sits next to me, puts his arm around my shoulder and asks me what we're discussing. I told him. He answers with ""i don't mind any religion but i really dislike people who don't have a god or say there is no god"". I was starting to like him and that was a funny reminder why i should stay clear. H is a muslim guy who comes from a sort of a rural-y area. I told him as i jokingly removed his arm from around me ""hahahaha then u better stay clear from me, because I'm that guy"".

Insidiously we started becoming very close friends. Didn't mean for it to happen but it just did. People often thought we were a couple and made jokes about us.  To me that was starting to become a problem because should he find out I'm really gay, he might retaliate and say that i abused my position as a close friend. But then i realized. A few months ago, H had told me that he would never be close friends with an atheist and yet now, he considers me one of his best friends. I realized he changed a lot during this period, for the better. Maybe i could use that to our advantage?

So i thought that I'd push the boundaries a little over time and test the waters about what he thinks of gay people. Obviously, his first reaction was that he's muslim and he's against this stuff but as long as gay people don't meddle with him he's cool. After a while he really thought of me as his best friend and would tell me his secrets and problems and i would be there for him yet i never shared anything myself. He asked me many times about myself to which i just responded with shady useless answers. He felt a bit weird about why our dynamics only revolved a one sided sharing but didn't push me to say anything. 

Soon enough, i started dropping more obvious gay jokes/hints, point out that someone looks handsome today, etc... and we fought a couple of times to which i responded ""we're very different anw, there are things you don't know about me, and with this attittude i doubt I'll ever let you know"".

By this time, i was extremely sure that he has high suspicions, yet he never changed his behavior whatsoever. Still the friendly touchy gay jokey guy he's been and it confused me as to where he stands. I promised him, after him asking about my secret, that i would reveal to him why I'm so shady when we're a month away from finishing the 2nd year. For the least damaging outcome. And he understood but reaffirmed to me that nothing would change our friendship.  That he's my best friend no matter what, he loves me regardless and he trusts me with everything and that's what i should do with him. I got reallllllyyyyy sentimental when he said that and i told him I'm gonna take him up for his words.

[A few days before coming out to him] we were practicing for OSCE (which is a clinical skills examination) and one of the parts included a training on how to deliver bad news (for ex: patient being hiv +) and counseling as a doctor. We were practicing on each other. There was another friend F with us in the room. And as one thing led to another, that friend brought up some homophobic comments. Mind you F is more afraid and weirded out than aggressive. I don't know what happened to him when he was young but he's really a pussy about it. So i answered him ""oh really F? What if i was gay, you'd stop being friends with me? That's not how friendships work you know.""
F: I wouldn't stop being friends with you but definitely not as friendly with you. I'd be weirded out.

Me: wow dude, nice to know where you stand if something as silly as this would come in between us. I wonder what would happen if we actually had a conflict of interest

F: Anw you're not gay and let's not worry about conflict of interest now.

H decides to take advantage of the question and tells me: Fine why don't you ask me? (Referring to the if i was gay question)

Me: fine. I made it as a joke as if i was delivering bad news and we're here for counseling. And i asked him in a doctorly fashion ""I'm here to inform you that your friend is gay. Would you still be friends with me if i was?.

H, sitting next to me, looks at me a knowing smile and leans in for a warm hug. TWICE during this conversation. I acted all natural but inside i was bursting with a feeling of success, relief and feeling loved. Now that F is farther away from us H says
 H: i told you nothing would change our friendship even that. You mean a lot to me and I'm never gonna have a friend like you. *heart breaks a thousand pieces*

After that, i decided it is time. The plan was a success. A slow, unabrupt change of heart and mind is all that i wanted him to undergo. It went perfectly! So a few days later, i went to his place we watched a movie and after it we went to his car were i, after a 10 min of swinging around the subject, finally told him. He knew, had suspicions, told me he doesn't mind it at all and I'm still his best friend and told me we still gonna make gay jokes and jokingly flirt around. Told me that he was waiting for me to finally tell him and that he's glad that i can finally trust him now. Told me that this shouldn't be a cause to part ways but rather now be closer and that i should come to him whenever i have troubles. I couldn't have asked for better!

A slow insidious change does make a difference on the long run. I reminded him of what he said to me last year about never being good friends with an atheist. Look at him now being best friends with a gay guy. If you don't call that progress than i don't know what progress is."
