0,"Weird


Rant on a throwaway. Totally direct me elsewhere if this isn't the appropriate subreddit.

I  went to this game night with my friend and most of the people there were queer; I thought ""I'll fit right in."" Nope. I was chillin but everyone was being super weird and rude. Someone made a gay joke.  Everyone laughed. So, I piggybacked on his joke and made one of my own to break the tension. Everyone stayed silent. Someone finally said, ""You  can't say that! Only gay people can say that!"" It dawned on me: everyone there thought that I was straight. I explained that I'm not. Everyone calmed down but they were still being weird.

Suddenly, one of them went on this long rant (directed at me) about how shameful  it is to be a masc4masc dude, how gay people who like sports are disingenuous (I mentioned that I've been doing martial arts for a few years), and how ""real"" gay people are effeminate. These dudes all just nodded in agreement. I left shortly. My friend kind of just sat there but he has social anxiety; I'm not mad he didn't say anything and he has apologized so many times since.

I'm so bummed out that I was met with such hostility just because I came off as ""masculine."" Whatever *that*  means. It's so weird that this is something I had to deal with. Who cares how one expresses their queerness? If you want to wear glittered  tutus, you should be able to do so. If I want to do BJJ, I should be able to do so too. Ain't no rules to being gay. Jesus. This isn't the first time I've been told I'm not ""really"" gay. Has anyone else had this experience? If so, how did you respond?

tl;dr: Other gay dudes told me I'm not a ""real"" gay man. :/"
1,"So there‚Äôs this girl but I‚Äôm gay and closeted.


[M | 17] I‚Äôm fucking closeted and gay. But there‚Äôs this girl I really like and we are REALLY good and close friends. I feel like I have been leading her on and I‚Äôm trying not to but it just happens naturally the more we interact. I don‚Äôt want her to just abandon me because a proper relationship isn‚Äôt forming. I don‚Äôt want that awkward environment to develop between us. I don‚Äôt want to come out to her so I don‚Äôt really know how to tell her that I‚Äôm not really interested in a romantic relationship. At the same time I can‚Äôt think of a way of delivering it without it being completely brutal even if I were to go to the desperate measure and tell her I‚Äôm gay.

There‚Äôs a formal/prom coming up next year as well and I kinda want to ask her but me asking her while not telling her I‚Äôm gay is expressing interest to engage in a romantic relationship. 

I don‚Äôt want to tell her I‚Äôm gay cause I feel as if it will be leaked to the whole school and eventually reach my christian family who I am heavily dependent on financially.

Basically what I‚Äôm asking you bros is what would you do in my situation? 

And thanks in advance."
2,"HIV/AIDS statistic that surprised me


Was listening to the Manwhore podcast a couple days ago. He isnt gay but has a few gay themed episodes. He was interviewing Mr. Pam who is a straight female porn director that exclusively shoots gay porn. Crazy! Anyways, she mentioned that about 2/3 of gay porn actors are HIV positive. What? I know Prep and other drugs have made it pretty safe now but I was totally blown away by that.  And, not to HIV shame, but it kinda killed the mood for me. I'll still jack off to gay porn (A LOT), just have different feelings about the whole thing. Thoughts?"
3,"Are your nipples super-sensitive?


My best friend told me he could make himself cum just by playing with his nipples. Anybody else can do that?"
4,"Nervous around other men.


Hey guys, I received a lot of abuse when I was younger for being gay.  Predominantly from men.  I am in a much better place now, however I still experience quite a lot of anxiety around men, gay and straight.  Usually I sweat a lot, worry, find it hard to talk coherently and I feel p inadequate.  Anyone else relate? Or have any advice from their experience of it? It stops me from making other guy friends and makes enjoying the male friendships I do have much more difficult "
5,"What's the best way you've celebrated the end of a bad relationship?


Inspired by [this story](https://www.star-telegram.com/news/nation-world/national/article221527670.html) about a woman who literally blew up her wedding dress with explosives after her divorce (I love this story, so dramatic!). How have you celebrated the end of your bad relationships? I usually just try to move on as fast as possible. "

7,"Advice for making my bf's first time special


So I started dating this guy about 3 months ago (we're both 27) and while we have gotten naked and physical (oral and light fingering), we haven't had sex. 
When I brought it up, he told me that he has never had sex due to body image issues (which I don't get because he's sexy). However, he wants to go there with me and I want his first time to be special. Do you bros have any ideas/suggestions for me so that I can make his first time amazing? "

9,"My man on Grindr


Yesterday while I went to see my boyfriend I noticed his phone with some notifications when I checked I found out it was GRINDR and he has the paid version, all his texts were kinda professional if you wanna call it that way, no hookups invitation, no sexy pictures just friends, he is an introvert and when confronted he told me that it's because he feels alone and wants to make friends. Now I ask you this, he told me to analyze the situation and then decide whether I decide to stay or just break up. 

What to do? "
10,"I know i need to tell my parents about my boyfriend sometime but...


(Disclamer english is not my first languarge so sorry if i butcher anything!)

So i am 18 and live in austria with a largly meutral family. Except my further away family (grait uncle and so on) has sayd homophobic stuff in the past, however my sister is the only person i ever came out to as she is the person i trust most in my family but my mom aswell as dad have shown suspicions. Enter my boyfriend of one year:

Today my mom asked if i got a crush and i didnt know what to answer and that got me thinking: someday ill need to tell them. Im scared idk how they will react... "
11,"Being Gay and Autistic is Awful


This is a rant post made while hungover so it will be a bit stream of conscious. I moved into a new city a few months ago. Haven‚Äôt made any gay friends or potential boyfriends. I have found straight people to hang with. Last night I decided to go to the gay bar alone because why not. Bars do not sit well with me. The noise, lights, and sounds reallly fuck me up. Also, I went out to try to prove to myself that I can be normal. All I did was remind myself that I can‚Äôt be. I sat at the bar trying to get drunk hoping the social lubricant would make me more outgoing instead of closed off. This nice lady celebrating her birthday gave me one shot (if you are reading this thank you again). The other three vodka drinks got me down (lightweight). I did become more extroverted, but autism took over. I walked around giving random people compliments and High-fives. Looking back, the solo guy in the club doing that is really creepy. Some dude out back immediately asked me if I was autistic. Before you say he was rude, he asked if I was okay. He also stated that he worked as a behavioral specialist. I told him that he should share his thoughts as statistically people are able to handle the truth better than most people think. He told me his assessment and tried to make me feel better. Thank you for trying. A guy standing nearby tried to help and asked if I friends. I lied and said I did because the truth hurt, and I didn‚Äôt want to ruin someone else‚Äôs night. I started running laps around the parking lot because that calms me down. I saw three dudes. Tried to talk to them. One of them made a remark that I didn‚Äôt and still don‚Äôt understand. I also watched two dudes play pool because pool is nice (I suck at the game lol). I left alone. The guy from earlier who asked if I friends asked again and said he had a girlfriend to establish a non threatening demeanor (I told him this wtf was I doing). I left alone. Tried to be cool with the Uber driver but probably came off like a drunken asshole (it‚Äôs Uber though they‚Äôve probably seen worse). Needless to say, I don‚Äôt think I will go again. I have a rep as the high-five fetish guy (it wasn‚Äôt sexual at all). All it did was remind me that I am not like other people and never will be, and I need to stay in my bubble. Oh, and Grindr doesn‚Äôt work well because I have no clue how to use that app."
12,"Was at a party last night and had a homophobic experience


Last night I went out with some friends and we decided to go to a house party. Long story short (cuz I don‚Äôt want to type out so much) a girl asked me ‚Äúso how many dicks have you taken up the ass then?‚Äù To me and I said thanks for the homophobic comment and she responds with ‚Äúwell I voted for trump so...‚Äù like ok? That has any relevance to the situation? So yeah we left immediately and called an Uber and the super weird thing of the night was that our Uber driver was actually gay and we told him the whole story it was such a weird coincidence. Anyway just wondering if anyone has any similar experiences? I go to school in a pretty conservative state so stuff like this might happen a little more. "
13,"Guy on tinder wants a green card üòí


Matched with a guy on tinder from abroad, who I guess set his location to mine. He‚Äôs from a first world country. My type. I‚Äôve been thinking of moving to where he is (was already in the plans, not related to him).

He said he‚Äôs looking for ‚Äòreal love.‚Äô

We chat on WhatsApp, but I‚Äôm pretty sure I know what he‚Äôs after now.

He wanted to video chat, so I was like ok. He showed me his room and it confirms the profession he told me he has. He asked to see my house so I showed him my room but he was like how about the rest of it...and I was like wtf, but ok I showed him the living room and the sky outside from the window.

He‚Äôs was initially calling like 3 or 4 times a day to chat, get advice because he found a job in the US and wants to know where‚Äôs a good city to live in and ask me questions about English since he‚Äôs learning.

He doesn‚Äôt want to take it though because he‚Äôll have to work 11 hours a day and he just wants to relax, like he‚Äôs doing now.

He asked to see my citizenship papers or passport and I was like wtf, no.

Then he asked if we can get married, and I was like I don‚Äôt even know you lol. Or he said I could move over there then get married lol.

I was like I don‚Äôt think so. 

Then he asked me where the rich guys live in the US.

He messaged me on grindr (set to travel mode), but I‚Äôm not sure if he knows it‚Äôs me, but he‚Äôs seen that picture before.

Every time he hangs up, he‚Äôs like love you baby.

So...what do you think?

And should I ghost him lol.

He‚Äôs pretty hot tho. Wanted to move to where he is to find a bf, but I don‚Äôt want someone using me for a green card.

He‚Äôs all like it‚Äôs real love, not for a green card and I‚Äôm like nah."
14,"Feeling extremely lonely as a self-hired worker/freelancer. How to snap out of it?


I work in 3D modeling and work at home most of the time. As I've grown older (22), soon to be 23 since it's already half way across November, I'm at the point where there is basically nobody in my life that I can call my 'close friend', or 'friend' at all anymore. (It is fucking sad, I know)

I basically just wake up everyday, get coffee, start working, eat, work, eat, shower, go to sleep. Sometimes I go to the gym but I'm also alone.

&amp;#x200B;

I hookup with dudes on grindr once in a while, but lately I've gotten bored. Most people on there I'm not really attracted to (I'm only into bearded men 30 and above), and others I would never get a response out of. Dudes that hang out with me never want to go on a second date or start a relationship, and the ones that I really like never take me seriously.

For example this guy I just texted him (hey, how you doing?) at 4 pm and he did not respond, and I just saw his last login on grindr is an hour ago (it is currently 7 pm). So basically, read, ignored. And it's funny because we were kinda getting it on after our first date, but after the second date the steam just went away.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm not mad at this though, I've gotten used to it. I think I am so out of touch with the society that, I'm basing too much of my personal happiness on another man. In human language, I think I'm relying too much on the idea of finding a boyfriend to make me happy - which can never workout because the idea itself is just not gonna work.

The point is, I feel like I'm stuck. How do I get out of it? I don't even know what I'm into anymore, I feel numb as a human being and the things that used to interest me (video games, I've played it my entire life) I can no longer find joy in. Any idea on how to improve this situation?"
15,"Losing my virginity at 17: yay or nay?


Asked my friends... got mixed responses. And they're basically straight and virgins so figured out why not ask here, right?

And if yes, please give me tips on bottoming. **I'm desperate**"
