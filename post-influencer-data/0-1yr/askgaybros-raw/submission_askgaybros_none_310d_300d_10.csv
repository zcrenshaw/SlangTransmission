0,"How do i become less insecure?


I just can't approach or purposely flirt with guys and it's probably made me miss a lot of opportunities and it's pissng me off. Any ideas how i could change that?

1,"Male sex-symbols whom girls drool over but you don't find remotely sexy


Cole Sprouse does nothing for me. I don't get why he has so many girls trembling because, just like Justin Bieber, he looks like a cute Lesbian. He's too androgynous for my taste. 

Ansel Elgort: Reminds me of a living male mannequin. Impossibly bland. He reminds me a lot of Hunter Parrish but with none of the sex appeal. "
2,"Perks of being Obviously gay


So yesterday for the first time a guy asked for my number while I was waiting for the subway to arrive. 

I was wearing a pink sweater, skinny pants and a pair of black boots. My hair is kinda long and dyed. Not ur most masc gay out there. "
3,"New straight friend got drunk and sent me multiple nudes on snapchat. Claims to not remember while sober.


So I befriended this cute, young straight guy (19, graduated HS last year). I'm a few years older. Anyway, we only met up once but it was very brief. He lives in a middle of nowhere town about a half hour away from me so our paths don't really cross, but we snapchat. Nothing too personal. Anyway.. one night he posted on his story he was drinking hard liquor. A few hours later at like 2-3am I get a ""send nudes"" snap lol I thought it was a joke, and knew he was buzzed/drunk, so I start trying to change the subject. 

It ended up with him sending not 1 but 3 pics of him holding his dick. The first one said something like ""suck me then"". I thought he maybe thought he was snapping the wrong person, but the second one was something like ""you know you want this"" with my name on it and then me changing the subject.. I asked why he deleted me the week before for a day or 2 and added me back.. and he sent another dick pic with ""i'm sorry baby let's start over"".

Then it switched to a text convo. I'm like ""you're drunk"" and he's like ""I'm not"" but I knew he was. He kept begging for me to pick him up and shit like ""let's fuck then."" I just changed the subject until he eventually stopped replying/fell asleep.

About 10 hours later he replies back with ""sorry that was drunk talk"". Now our snapchat talks aren't as frequent as they should be. I just told him whatever he's going through I'll always be here, even if he doesn't feel like replying to me.

So ughhhh what the hell is going on here."

6,"Used aneros for the first time and didnt have any orgasm. Any suggestions?


I'm a 30 year old gay man and I used an aneros for the 1st time. I just tried anal sex one time, but it went horrible because at that time I didn't know about how to clean my ass right, so I never tried again. Today I used my aneros Progasm, which is recommended for intermediate users, however it wasn't a problem for me to insert it and leave it in my ass. I was horny, I watched some porn and then inserted my progasm. I did some contractions so it stimulates my prostate, but it wasn't as pleasant as I expected. So I worked it manually and I know I was hitting the right spot because my penis was getting really wet. I played with the prograsm for more than an hour, but however I didn't reach the called ""super o"", so then I just masturbated as usual. Any suggestions on how to use it? Thanks in advance..."
7,"Should I keep trying?


I been single for a while and still had no luck, guys  been disappearing left and right. I haven't had a good relationship ever since, and its getting a bit tiring. Sometimes I don't what I'm doing wrong, or why do these guys just vanish out of thin air for no reason. ALOT say I'm cute, but my character is stable and decent. I'm kinda strict on my words in chat even in my bios (only about myself). It seems like all the good fish are gone, either most of them are solely into stupid hookups, or way too busy in college as they wouldn't bother laying a finger on the power button, or find long distance to be a issue (I mean you shouldn't let LD drain you to sadness, at least make plans). 

Should I keep trying or stop for now and focus on myself?

Also, if you wonder why I'm ""strict"" on my words in bios? I would happy to tell why "
8,"Am I gay if I love another man but not sexually?


 

## Am I gay if I love another man but not sexually?

So I've been confused for a while. Wondering if I'm gay but whenever I'm alone (if you catch my drift) I don't get excited to mean. As a matter of fact, it kills my boner. With that being said, I do find guys attractive. I also really like talking to my male coworkers. And I think about a specific one more than anyone else. But like I said my boner. I'm just wondering am I gay? Or is this a ""bro-crush""?"
9,"What did I do wrong?


So last weekend I went on a date with a guy. Basic going out for drinks. By all accounts it went great. We had a lot in common, we both had a lot of fun, we had amazing sex afterward too. At the end he told me he can’t wait to see me again. He even said it was cool to call him babe. We went as far as planning a second date out, we picked out the place and picked out a time.

Fast forward to today, and out of NOWHERE he texts me saying that we’re not a match, and this isn’t anything personal, but he just doesn’t see it and we shouldn’t hang out anymore. He told me not to take this personally.

I asked him what I did wrong and he didn’t respond. He hasn’t responded to any of my questions. I didn’t blow him up or anything, i just like three or four messages clarifying how I felt and I wished him well.

But still, what did I do wrong?? Did I come on too strong? What could I have possibly done? And Most importantly, why do I always fuck everything up? What’s wrong with me?

Thanks."

11,"Beginner plug set


I’m a virgin atm but the idea of bottoming is very appealing and also the anal stuff that I have tried is pretty fun. I’ve seen a lot/made some post seeing people recommending a plug set for bottoming any recommendations? Links appreciated"
12,"Do any of you guys ever get baby-crazy?


I don't know what it is about this time of year, between Halloween and Christmas all the cheesy holiday movies and thanksgiving specials on crappy sitcoms, tiny baby costumes in every store and Amazon reading my mind and recommending stuff I'd never actually look for, but all of it makes me go completely baby-crazy.

I feel like all I was born to do was to nurture and take care of something and to love it more than anything else in the world. I want a kid so fucking badly, and it's insane cause I usually find babies super creepy and gross. I'm not even in a serious relationship, and as much as I love the idea of getting married to a wonderful husband some day, that somehow feels secondary. It's not as important to me as being a father is. 

I wish we lived in a world where it was easier for a single gay man to adopt. And I fucking hate that every year between October and December I get so ridiculously sentimental and emotional about everything, fantasizing about raising a kid by myself, just imagining a baby's tiny hand wrapped around my finger. 

Do any of you ever think about this stuff? Does the baby-craze hit you in unexpected phases? It sucker-punches me so hard in the feels, I just don't know what to do."
13,"Been doing a diary lately, i wrote this yesterday and still don't know how to feel about it


Disclamer: It's terribly written and all in all a huge mess. I just need some opinions from you guys. Possibly a hug. 


Lately my depression is getting worse, I am looking for a reason, a thing that makes me go on.
But I cannot find it, and with each day passing my condition deteriorates. I didn't go to school today.
The last thing keeping me upright was the scapegoat in the form of the two online friends I made a few weeks ago. 

One of them, Nathan, was specially dear to me. For a, moment i thought i had found it again, my reason, my fluidum vitale. I felt i could live for something. For someone. 

Turns out, i had misjudged our so-called ""close friendship"" for something more. I got over attached way too quickly . Looking back at it, i feel silly. We live thousands of kilometers apart, and given his so-called ""lusty, exhibitionist personality"", it's clear he wouldn't want anything as pathetic like a long distance relationship with one such as me, let alone wait that long. Him thinking about a friends with benefits just confirmed how flawed and one-sided my thinking was. 

But the ""I love you"" he told me all those nights, what did they mean for him? How he wanted to cuddle me and hold me close? Did he mean it in a ""friendly way"", or was it all empty words? 

I should've told him this that exact time, reveal to him how i truly feel. Given the circumstances though, the shock was too great for me to let out anything other than a stuttered ""I-I'm sleepy, i think i'll go, night"", i didn't even know what to think about it in that moment. "

15,"How do I get fit? I always try to get healthy but can never stick to it. How do you guys do it?


I’ve always had a problem of sorts with my body image. I’m not fat pet say, but I’m leaning on the heavier side, and sometimes I wish I was a lot healthier. I always look on say r/gaybrosgonemild and everyone there is super ripped and fit, sometimes makes me feel badly about my own body image. Thing is I have a really bad problem with snacking, and whenever I try to stop that habit I fail. How do I start, and not give up along the way? Do any of you guys follow a routine of sorts, and how do you stick to it?"
16,"I appreciate you fem guys!!!!


I was in a gay bar the other day and this bartender was so cute and he acted so feminine and it was honestly a turn on. With guys with me their so no discrimination I’m attracted to 50% feminine and 50% masculine. I just try to stear clear of the evil gay men that like to cause drama and act like one of the Real housewives of Atlanta. If I ever do get a guy all I will want is for him to be chill and drama free."

18,"Trying to understand this new world


So two days ago I had finally gathered the courage to post my story about my sexuality and about coming to terms with it. I am 25 and have never really bothered to think about my sexual orientation, until recently. 

Thankfully I received a lot of support and it was very comforting knowing that there are many people like myself out there. 

Right now I am really stressed about telling my family my secret, mostly my parents, especially since I am the oldest and only Male of four siblings. And I know they will be heartbroken knowing that I can't give them their first grandchild or introduce them to my wife. But I know the truth needs to come out and what happens will happen. 

I'm very strong in my faith so as of now I don't see myself being intimate with another man or form any sort of relationship. I've never so much as kissed another man or seen one completely naked. I know there's much more to being gay than to  be attracted to the same sex or being flamboyant. 

So please bros, help me out. I'm completely lost and find comfort in reading about other people's stories and experiences. So thank you for reading."
