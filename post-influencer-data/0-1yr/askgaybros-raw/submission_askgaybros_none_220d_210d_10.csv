0,"Healthy looking body is a hot body!


sure muscles look good, and for some big bellies do the trick but guys being healthy, eating good food and doing at least the minimum of exercises might be a good way to look good no matter the body type you are, twinks, bears, daddies. Agree? You don't have to look like an adonis, just stay healthy!"
1,"Today I officially move on and out, of a three year relationship.


I know this is what‚Äôs best. Three days ago was our 3 years... 

Happy valentines to me."
2,"Guys always think I'm a catfish because I don't have Instagram or Snapchat. What are some ways to prove to someone that you're real?


Instagram makes me feel like shit and I find Snapchat confusing.

I don't want to give out my phone number to strangers so WhatsApp is a no-go.

I don't have Facebook either.

I usually ask them if they have Kik or Skype but most guys don't"
3,"Post ‚Äòdate‚Äô


So I‚Äôm just back from a tinder ‚Äòdate‚Äô with a guy. So, I‚Äôm really interested in how the guy has perceived me. So my question is this, is it weird to ask someone for constructive criticism after going on a ‚Äòdate‚Äô? 

Also, I need a replacement word for ‚Äòdate‚Äô cause it‚Äôs just not adequate for describing an initial meeting between people after talking on tinder. "
4,"How long should I give my butt to recover?


Last night I pushed a large butt plug a little too far, had some pain (nothing extreme just enough to know when to stop) and a teeny tiny bit of blood. Today Ive had no issues and have been to the toilet without any pain, just wondering how long I should lay off the anal exploration. Was gunna give it 3 days then take it slow from there should that be enough? thanks all"
5,"Jealousy


Hi!

I tend to get jealous whenever my boyfriend talks to other gay men. Last saturday a guy kept appeoaching him/us whom he knew through Grindr (before he met me and he never did something with him). I have no reason to get jealous at all since he never cheated and I don't think he ever will. We are each others first boyfriends and tell each other all the time that we love each other and we never had any fights.

However, whenever a gay guy approaches him, it affects me. Not even gay guys in general, but only if I know that the talked to them or slept with them before he knew me. I tend to get really anxious and try to observe the whole situation the whole night, like where the guy is etc. 

I kind of had it under control but last saturday the guy kept following him. Immediately going to the toilet whenever my BF went et cetera and his girlfriends were asking him if he ""had succeeded"" already.

Nothing happened, but it really ruined my mood while it started as a fun night. My boyfriend noticed and decided that we should go home. It sucks that he noticed cause he obviously didnt do anything wrong, it was just my unfounded jealousy (and an annoying guy lol, my bf admitted that he wouldnt stop trying to contact him/us). 

I don't want to feel jealous when someone from my boyfriends past approaches him, I don't want to let it ruin my mood. Has anyone experienced the same? And how did you help it? I trust my boyfriend comoletely so I guess it comes out of insecurity? That Im afraid that he'll choose them over me?"

7,"Any ectomorphs here who have successfully gotten great glute gains while working out?


 

Skinny guy here.

5‚Äô10, 150lbs.

I have bulked up from about 135lbs over the last year, and have been running a PPL program with fairly good results. I struggle with mental health issues so gym hasn‚Äôt always been the MOST consistent (every so often there will be a few days between workouts) but vast majority of the time I‚Äôm getting 4-5 workouts in a week.

I do squats (although I‚Äôm struggling to get past 170lbs for five sets of five), deadlifts and I‚Äôve even added weighted hip thrusts.

Seeing improvements everywhere...except the glutes. I‚Äôm talking flat as a pancake.

Any other naturally skinny hard gainers that have successfully gotten a nice poppin booty? Reveal your secrets! üßôüèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è"
8,"How's your love life?


I branched out and finally meeting people outside apps. 

Turns out I share a scary amount of common interest with a teammate. Sat in his car from 3am-6am (after a night out with teammates) talking about some really personal shit and we've only known each other for a few weeks

Ends with both of us saying how it's crazy that there is probably someone right in our face that's damn near perfect for them but they're both too stupid to actually realize and act on it

How's yall love life going üôÉ"
9,"Open relationships?


What's it like being in one? Personally, I don't think I could ever be part of one, but I want to understand them more. 

Why did you and your partner decide to open the relationship? Are you happy together? How do you not get angry that your partner fucks other people and they may possibly be hotter and a better lay than you? I could see myself seething with resentment if I was in the that situation. Is your relationship more like a fwb thing or do you actually love each other."
10,"I can‚Äôt tell if I like what he likes only because I‚Äôm into him.


A guy I like recommended some TV shows &amp; music and I don‚Äôt know if I actually like it or if its because I want to like it because I like him.
I can‚Äôt stand the thought of me changing myself for someone else just when I‚Äôve finally figured out who I am and what I like.

So question is, how do you guys determine if you actually like something because you genuinely do vs liking something because you know he likes it too?"
11,"Where do you get mental health help if you don‚Äôt have money


I need to see a mental health professional. Unfortunately, it seems nearly impossible to find a therapist/psychiatrist that is covered by insurance up front. I‚Äôm in the U.S. btw"
12,"Would going to Madrid‚Äôs pride alone be worth it??


I‚Äôm a 19 y.o gay guy who have never been to a pride festival before since I do live in a homophobic country,so I have decided to want to make my 2019 a year of liberation and travel somewhere where I can go to pride and proudly celebrate who I am,but the problem is it is going to be my first time traveling abroad alone and I don‚Äôt have any friends or made any friends in any country abroad so I can go with. I‚Äôm really afraid of like trying to push myself or not knowing how to really enjoy it since I‚Äôm just going to be alone with no friends around,I don‚Äôt know if I‚Äôll be meeting any guys around or barely anything to be honest.
I googled some places that I can go to and have an amazing experience in pride and for now madrid is in the top of my list when it comes to pride,I would love to hear it from others if they have been to madrid‚Äôs pride before or are actually going this year."

14,"Bi to gay while in a relationship


I guess you can say I've identified as bi since my early 20's (25 now) but I'm really starting to believe that I'm actually gay. Currently in a 5 year relationship with my girlfriend who knows I'm bi and we live together, which as you can imagine makes this difficult. 

For those of you who maybe ""started"" as bi and later realized you were really gay, what led you to find that out? Especially if you were in a relationship when it happened"
15,"How many of you have daddy issues?


I find myself attracted to men that is generally like a father figure to me. Sometimes it's the way they act - guys that seem mature and kind gets me out of my ways hooked. Guys that are hairy turns me on a lot too, just like my dad, honestly, I'm not ashamed to say I think my dad is a very attractive person, but I never had any sexual thoughts about him.

&amp;#x200B;

However I have never felt like I wanted to call somebody daddy in bed, even when somebody wants me to say it. It happened before, I didn't say it but end up cuddling with him in his arms, resting my head on his chest. Which, is sort like father and son behavior. Also, I find great joy in pleasing father like partners, I kiss their whole body gently, I get hard as wood when giving a blowjob, I'm over the moon when he is moaning from the pleasure of me eating his ass. 

&amp;#x200B;

Do I have daddy issues? Apparently it has to do with my dad not being enough of a dad in my childhood. This kinda fucked me up in a way, I am very clingy and wants attention from the other guy in relationships, I have low self esteem, etc. I wonder how many of you guys feel the same, especially when good fathers are extremely rare these days?"
16,"To all my trans bros bibros and gaybros that have vitiligo .


Two years ago while I was showering and I noticed something around my cock and and testicles I was afraid that I might've gotten some type transmitted disease  until I made an appointment with a specialist that same year and the specialist told me that I have vitiligo which suprised me in a way tho . 

The question is do you guys get discouraged that you have that skin condition?

 At times I get discouraged that I wont find someone because of that skin condition and also because of optical nerve atrophy (eye condition including my learning disability (mild intellectual disorder) (i.e mild retardation) "
