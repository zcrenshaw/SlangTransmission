0,"What's your reaction when you see a younger guy (&lt;25) coupled up with an older Daddy (45+)?


Stumbled across a pair (22 and 48) on grindr and it stopped me in my tracks. I can imagine a hookup with the Dad/Son kink but an actual relationship had me a bit unsure. Maybe it was envy because I found the younger guy cute, i'm not sure. There was also a wonder of whether the older guy was taking advantage in a way, maybe for the younger guys need for a father figure. Guess i'd feel similar with an older/younger M/F scenario, just wanted to know other peoples thoughts..."
1,"I want to get back together with my ex


So I broke up with my boyfriend because all my friends were telling me I needed to hoe around in college or I would regret it, but now that I have hoe'd it up I really don't think that's what I want. Anywho we haven't talked since I ended things so how should I approach asking him if he wants to get back together? Also I know that that was a shitty reason to end a relationship which is why I'm trying to get it back now. "
2,"The guy I love is getting to know someone. What should I do?


Guys, I sincerely ask for your opinions and will be grateful if you kindly send me yours (opinions).
The thing is: I like a guy from work and I thought he was enjoying myself too (cause he was approaching very often, making me smile, giving me chocolates, and all those little things that matters a lot).
I'm so I'm love with him but I'm also very shy and I'm not an open person (I mean, I don't know how to interact w/ people). Also, I always had a low self esteem, so I think that he is much for me, and all  that.
This week I felt that he was strange at work. And yesterday I found out that he is talking to someone who's a friend of one of my personal friends. He is getting to know that guy and my friend (who didn't know I love him) told me that occasionally yesterday. Now I'm so broken. My heart is broken and I can't stop crying. I was planning to tell him what I feel, and then I found this out...
I don't know what I should do now. Should I avoid  him, don't respond to him there anymore, or should I try to get closer even though I'm mad? What do you all think?
I keep on thinking about him and that guy. I imagine he's giving love to him and I go crazy just  thinking about it.

Thanks guys for reading this. Help me out! "
3,"When will he take things to the next level?


I met this guy on Grindr two weeks ago. I was not looking for straightaway hook-ups on it, and I made it very clear to him in the beginning.

Our chatting was such a pleasure and it led to a meeting offline several days later, at his place (I can't host). He cooked something for me, and we talked for a couple of hours. Then we went to bed and had sex. The sex was good, so was the talk.

I already felt very attractive to him after the first meet. Then we kept our chatting on Whatsapp eveyday. We met two more times, one time talked + sex, another one dinner + talked + sex. I think I've already developed strong feelings for him. 

I once talked about taking things more seriously with him, the day after our first meet. He said we should meet a few more times and know more about each other. Now that we've met three times, I am still not sure if he wants to make things between us more serious. 

I've never had a boyfriend, or be in a serious relationship with anybody. I don't know how things work when two people trying to confirm the relationship. Should I propose the idea? Should I just wait and see? Am I over-investing in this ""thing""?

(Background about us: he's a local resident who is ten years older than me; I'm a foreign student. Therefore I also wondered if he had any practical considerations.)

9,"New Guy - Trying to figure it all out &amp; need advice.


Disclaimer; this may be a long rambling post, but I appreciate any and all who read and can offer their thoughts. This is my first time on Reddit/ever posting to a forum like this. If this post is in the wrong place, please tell me and I'll move it.

&amp;#x200B;

So I guess like the title, I'm trying to figure it all out. I'm an out gay man, 21 y/o and in my last year at uni. I've been out for about 4 years now but I don't feel like I've been experiencing life as a gay man &amp; I'm beginning to feel a bit inadequate. I'm not exactly sure why or how, but I feel like I've never found my place in the community. I went to my first Pride this summer in NYC (before I turned 21) and it was the most fun I've had in a long time. :) 

While I do have a very close network of great friends, I've never had any close friends that are gay. I've never had someone or been able to ask questions that only another gay guy would understand; someone who's been through or is going through what I'm going through, relationship advice, where to go/what to do.. I know the LGBT communities both in my college town and hometown aren't the strongest, but my vibe probably isn't the most helpful for meeting people either. I'm very unassuming, most people don't know I'm gay unless I say it. Not overly masculine, not overly feminine, just very in the middle I suppose would be a good way to define me.

Relationships &amp; Dating have also proved difficult for me. Like I mentioned, I really don't have great sources of advice for dating, and I wouldn't classify my previous relationships as any great success stories. Because of my location and only recently being 21, I've been limited to dating apps, Tinder, Chappy, Grindr as my source for meeting people. I like to talk and I think I'm fairly easy to talk to, but meeting guys online is like pulling teeth! Endless swipes, matches, a little back and forth and you're ghosted. No one's really ""looking to meet new friends"" so I'm clearly looking in the wrong place for that. 

I realize I'm rambling now... In conclusion, I don't know where to go, I don't know what to do and I'm having trouble fitting in and meeting people; but I don't wanna give up (no matter how dissuaded I might be from the people I've met on these damn dating apps.) I'm in the NYC Metro area on the Jersey side of the river.

Thank you all. &lt;3

10,"I'm screwed. Please help me.


It's a short story, but hear me out.

So it was 4 pm yesterday afternoon, I was just looking through my twitter feed, when suddenly, I receive a text from my crush saying that he likes me too, like, out of nowhere (we do talk from time to time), so much so that it ""hurts"" him. So naturally, I told him that I liked him too. Little did I know that I just activated HER trap card. (The phone was being used by a different person at the time)

So this girl that I barely know (my ex-lab partner) starts sharing screenshots of our little conversation in my class group chat. And I'm a Malaysian, so I don't think I need to tell you the war that ensued. Just google ""LGBT rights in Malaysia"" and the results are not pretty. Even people I consider(ed) friends have turned against me (not all of them). What. On. Earth. It should be considered an offence. To share private conversations without others' consent. And she had the audacity to send me an apology with crying emojis (if she's crying, then imagine what I must be feeling). And her apology is basically just ""Oh I'm sorry. I didn't mean to hurt you! Tee hee!"" What the fuck. You ruined my life! If you didn't mean to hurt me, then why would you deliberately do something with the intent to sabotage me? You can't say you didn't mean to, moron. If saying sorry gets you out of any situation then we wouldn't have jails, would we? In fact, speaking of jails, you broke the user agreement of Whatsapp by infringing on my privacy, impersonated another guy, and spread hate speech so that my classmates would harass me. Didn't mean to my foot, cunt. And words spread. Just two weeks ago my stupid YouTube channel blew up just because it was meme-able. And it was memed into oblivion. Boy I can't wait for this to blow up! The damage is already done. There is ABSOLUTELY NOTHING anybody can do to fix this.

Have you guys seen the movie ""Love, Simon""? I feel like I'm experiencing the climax of the film right now. Except the people around me are much more aggressive. she's the villain of the movie, she leaked my secret, when I'm the one whose supposed to have the right to tell to whoever I want, whenever I feel like it and however I feel like! And she took that opportunity from me! And just like Simon, now I have basically no friends. Just for some context, Malaysia is primarily dominated by muslims, and apparently, when you're a muslim, you MUST hate gay people. You're not allowed to form your own opinion. So after this weekend, I expect to be at least ignored by my classmates and at worst, killed. But hey, if they found my dead body, at least they know who to blame.

Now the motive, it's pretty simple, really. They want me to be exposed as a gay guy cuz then they will kill me and they will get ""pahala"" or whatever. There is no way they didn't do that on purpose. And somehow, the victim gets more hate than the criminal. Say that again, but slowly. What the fuck is wrong with this country? It's makes me sick. This morning, I was walking out from my hostel and literally one of my ""friend"" saw me, turned around and pretend like he didn't see me. Arrrghhh. Why is everybody against me!!

And now, we wait. Let's see what happens after the weekend. I will keep you updated. Current mood? Just listen to Escapism by Rebecca Sugar. It perfectly encompasses my feeling right now. The feeling of confusion, whether or not to just shrug it off and say ""haha ya got bamboozles lmao"" or to just tell the truth, which is I'm gay. Please advise me. 

TL;DR I told my crush that I was gay, and it turns out he was being impersonated by a girl who posted my comments in my class group chat. And now I need advice."
11,"Hookup rejection timing


I had a Grindr hookup organised today. However, as soon as I saw the guy when he arrived at my apartment, I knew it wasn't going to happen (he looked a lot older, and just generally a lot worse, than his pics).

Usually my strategy for this would be to invite him in for a drink, have a chat, and then when he suggests or hints that we go to the bedroom, I say I'm not feeling it and he'll leave.

Today basically as soon as I met him outside I just said I wasn't feeling it, and he left. It was kind of awkward but a lot more efficient than my previous strategy. This got me thinking about what most people do in a similar situation - do you tell them straight away that you're not keen, or do you invite them in, talk for a bit and then tell them?"
12,"Poop during anal


 

I recently came out of the closet and I found a guy I really like. I've never done anal sex before but I've been excited and nervous about it. To ""practice"" I bought a dildo. Threw a condom on the fucker and went to town. I liked it, however when I looked at the condom after a couple minutes there was a bit of black smelly poo on it. I properly cleaned and did my homework. I was so grossed out that I put it away.

How do I properly clean and how will I know when my booty hole is all good and ready to go without incident? I'm super scared now. Anything I should be changing about my diet to make this NOT happen?"

14,"Paranoid teen?


Im a bisexual teen (16) M and last week I had unprotected intercourse with a male friend. We are both curious, but this was my first time with another male. The day Of our  Link ( Like 3 hours before we met)  I had diarrhea and my stomach was upset, which I thought was because Of school lunch. Anyways, Once I get to his house we have intercourse ( I was the top), and then I went back home. Two days later  (sunday) I started feeling sick, I was bloated and I had a sore throat. On monday I was really congested and sneezing I suspected a sinus infection was beginning. Monday through Wednesday the symptoms remained the same, Sore throat, congestion and the occasional sneeze. On thursday I noticed my back was hurting and I had an odd feeling in my leg (not pain). I have scoliosis, So This was normal to me and I thought nothing of it. Fast foward to saturday And I notice I have a tonsil stone in the back of my throat which I usually get when I’m having sinus issues; but the weird thing was that my tounge is a weird yellowish color. I had an odd jaw pain and my lymph nodes were swollen for about an hour. I havent had a high fever any of these days, So I dismissed the flu as being the cause. 


I googled all the symptoms and It points to HIV, giving the fact That I had unprotected sex. Am I being a hypochondriac or Is this something serious? Its been on my mind 24/7 and I get sick to my stomach thinking about having the horrible disease."
15,"What do you do when you see someone from grindr in public?


I checked out this small cafe in my neighborhood since I had never been there. Upon entering, I saw a guy who had messaged me on grindr the other day. I wasn't interested so I ignored his message. I'm pretty sure he was mad-dogging me. When I had walked in, he was looking at me and I immediately recognized him. He had a bitchy expression on his face when we made eye contact but that could've been his reaction to a conversation he was having with his friends. I felt really embarrassed and uncomfortable and pretended like I didn't see him but I know we saw each other.  To make it worse, I sat at a table right next to his and he looked at me again probably to make sure it was me. I stayed silent because I didn't know how to react. "
