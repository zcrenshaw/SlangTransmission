0,"I JUST TOPPED FOR THE FIRST TIME


Guys this means more than it sounds to me.

So I had very strong erectile dysfunction for almost my entire youth im 20 now and it started with 15 because that's when my depression started to really take me down. I had almost no libido never really jerked off and after I started  dating I almost never got hard at all, not even a bit. You can belive how this damaged my self esteem because of all the men telling me that I think they're not good enough or ugly or me thinking it etc. Even when that was never the case, especially my ex bf broke up with me (cheated on me) because of that. The sex was always a disaster. I never even could get hard with Viagra, and I mean a lot of viagra.

But it happened today.

I topped for the first time, I started with therapy and exercises a couple months ago, quit school that completely made me depressed and started focusing on myself and I started feeling happy and confident again (with the help of meds.)

So I decided to go on a date again, i thought it will turn out as usual of me being the bottom but he asked me if i want to fuck him because i was ACTUALLY HARD I thought that my dick will get soft anyways but it didn't and it felt great, bros let me tell you it felt really great, I felt the change of my life in just having successful sex for the first time after so many disappointing times.

Im so happy now the last years have been so depressing and soul crushing some times but now i think im on the right track again."
1,"Came Out to my 'Homophobic' Friend, Here's the Scoop


After years of being fearful about telling him and telling lies to hide the truth, I finally came out to my best friend who just so happens to be a very conservative and mildly homophobic individual.  Occasionally he would make fun of gay people or talk about how disgusting it was. 

So last night I finally just told him over text. I have moved on to college and he is a high school senior,we don't really see each other that often, so I figured that there wasn't much harm in telling him at that point. 

My friend kept asking the name of the person I had been crushing on all last year, I finally said that 'he' had graduated with me and we both went to different colleges, so we were not dating. The conversation immediately turned to me trying to argue that I was in fact gay because he didn't believe me. Whether that was denial or not i'm not sure, but he kept saying that I don't 'act gay' so there is no possible way that I am. Eventually with the help of some other friends, I was able to convince him.

He then asked why I never told him, being my best friend and all, I then explained to him about how in the past he had said some toxic things that made me uncomfortable. What happend next surprised me, he started apologizing and explaining how he felt like and ass for being so inconsiderate in the past. I told him that he should feel like an ass, but that he can make up for it by changing his ways and being more inclusive and kind in the future to other people who are different than him. Something makes me think this really hit home with him because of what he said to end the conversation...

""Whether you are gay or not, you're still my friend :) ""

Sorry i'm not a great writer, but hopefully this little story brightens your day a bit."
2,"My therapist thinks it would benefit me to share my story with people at least anonymously so I will try here. I am sorry if I disturb anyone


4 years ago I was at another town for an exam. I wanted to get into the town's lawschool. It's not like the US system here so I must explain. You go to every law school you want to apply for and take their exam. So since my dad has to work early he left me at the town's bus station(the only thing that was open at that early hour) 3 hours before the exam. I was supposed to take a cap and go to the exam when the time came and wait inside the bus station until then. So I went in but there were no people there except for a really weird looking guy. So after about half an hour this guy starts to throw little papers at me. Like small paper balls. And this got me really worried like this guy looked like he wasn't in his right mind. Then some people came in and he stopped and I got calmer.



But after like half an hour the people left and this guy started throwing papers at me again and talking to himself. At this point I got really frightened and since I saw some men smoking outside on the station I went to them and lit a cigarette. They started talking to me and they said they were locals and we talked some more and they seemingly left. I lit another cigarette and at that point a car stopped by me. And the window opened and it was these guys. And they offered to take me to my exam that I told them about earlier. 


Now my mom has always told me to never get into a strangers car so I politely refused their offer. At this point one of the guys literally jumped out of the backseat of the car and dragged me in, I was overwhelmed not knowing what was going on I couldn't react all I remember is I was frightened. He dragged me into the car and I don't know what happened I didn't feel a sting, I didn't feel anything being put on my face or anything. All I know I started feeling dizzy and just passed out. 


I woke up from a horrible pain in my private parts. I wake up on the ground, my eyes are still not seeing clearly my vision is very blurred but I realize I have something in my mouth (which later turns out to be a pair of socks), and my mouth is taped as well, my hands are tied behind my back and a guy is forcing himself inside me.


My vision became clearer and at this point I see this is one of the guys from earlier. Then another. Then another. And then another. All 4 of them took their turns. I was screaming but my voice was silent I was in so much pain. And then they finished. And then the beating started. They were determined to beat me to death. And they almost did. Left me in the woods barely breathing. Lucky for me I was discovered only 10 minutes later and I was saved.


The guys were never caught. It was never clear if the guy who was throwing papers at me was a means of getting me out of the building or just a crazy guy but he was never found either.



Now so many years later, I have a wonderful boyfriend, who is nice and caring but having sex still presents a problem that I can't get over. I am sorry for this grim story but I needed to lift it off my shoulders to some extent."
3,"UPDATE (College Roommate)


Long story short for new viewers. I thought my roommate was gone, brought a boy from a party back to my room and we fucked but my roommate was in the room the whole time. 

- UPDATE: This morning I decided to say something to him and all he had to say was “Just glad I didn’t interrupt anyone’s nut and I’m surprised you’re a taker not a giver.” So everything seems to be all good. Cheers to a good semester."
4,"Walked in on boyfriend sleeping with another guy.


Follow up from my last post. We talked two nights ago and agreed to not mess around with other people and to give our relationship a chance to heal.

I guess my boyfriend didn't really care. He went out last night around 11:30pm with a ""friend"". I asked before if it was truly just a friend and he said yes.

I saw nudes on his phone and I asked if he sent them to anyone, he said no.

I wake up to him coming a little after 2am, and I noticed someone else too. 

This is against our rules - to give each other notice if someone is staying the night.

I asked who was here and he said his friend was spending the night because he was too tipsy to drive.

He went back into the room and something didn't seem right.

(We have separate rooms because of our work schedule/sleep differences)

Shortly after he comes back out and showers. I asked him again what's going on and he said he just wanted to shower because he wanted to wash off from being at the bar.

Afterward he finished and went back into his room I knock on the door. No answer. Then I go in and he's holding some guy in his arms, they're both naked.

They just had sex, unprotected. He fucked some guy he met at the bar, and let the guy fuck him.

We went into the kitchen and talked and he basically didn't care. 

He looked happy when I saw him with the other guy and like he fully enjoyed himself.

He slept with me the rest of the night even though I felt disgusted and couldn't even sleep.

I didn't kick the other guy out cause as a human being I don't want him to crash. Also it's not his fault he got in the middle of this.

This morning he went back to his bed. I found him cuddling the other guy.

I am so done. He doesn't give a fuck. 

What he did was so cold and fucked up.

I am packing my bags right now as I type this. 

I am so fucking traumatized by what I saw. I don't think I could ever be intimate with him again."
5,"Is it normal that I feel somewhat hurt by this?


I am 35. My brother is 29. He has a kid, my nephew who is 3 years old. My parents really wanted to have a grandchild and when I told them I am gay, they were very disappointed. My brother however ""unshamed"" the family and has a son. The thing is that ever since that my parents have gone colder towards me. They used to invite me over for holidays and now they invite my brother and his family but not me. See my brother doesn't want to stay in the same room with me ever since I came out so they are kind of picking to invite him over me. And I realise that they want to see their grandchild but I feel hurt. I am their son after all... 


My life hasn't turned out as I dreamed as a kid. I have let go of hopes for romantic life years ago. Being gay here isn't easy. I just run my business and live my life. I have accepted that I won't have children of my own. And that's ok, I've gotten over it. It pains me sometimes but it's the way life is I guess. But I thought I would at least have my family. Guess I was wrong about that as well."
6,"Recipe for a successful hookup:


1) Tell him “let’s Netflix and chill” 

2) Pretend you forgot your Netflix password

3) ask him to sign into his Netflix 

4) click the save passcode button when he isn’t looking

5) watch Netflix which will eventually lead to a hookup 

6) regardless of how the hookup goes you now have a Netflix account to use :) 

That’s all best of luck guys!!"
7,"Don’t trust guys in Grindr when hooking up


Not necessarily seeking advice but giving you all some advice after this experience. 

Yesterday I hooked up with this guy. We’ve been chatting for a while and decided to meet yesterday. When we exchanged pictures I sent him a pic of me getting barebacked but explained that that was my boyfriend and play safe with strangers. He said no problem, he has condoms and would use protection. 

I get to his place, the mood is good! We start to make out I suck his dick, he puts me in all fours and eats my ass. After that I hear him open a condom wrapper and I assumed he put it on as he tossed the wrapper to the side. He eats my ass again and then starts to fuck me, I am still on all fours and enjoying it. He is alternating between fucking me, fingering me and eating me out for maybe 15 minutes. 

After a while I tell him to change positions, he pulls out, I get on my back and the first thing I see is his dick not wrapped!! I freak the fuck out on him and start yelling. He is apologizing and saying he forgot! He was carried away and forgot to put it on!! Bullshit, this dude definitely pretended to put the condom on. 

I practically ran out of there half naked, dude is telling me change before I leave to which I said fuck you. Left with my shorts unbuckled, without wearing a shirt and carrying my shoes. I felt violated and so outraged. Now I have to get tested and had to tell my boyfriend. 

Moral of this story is don’t trust guys on Grindr. Make sure they are wrapped, you put the condom on their dick to make sure, get tested regularly and don’t fucking lie and tell someone you will use a condom and then not use one without consulting them. Fuck I am so pissed!!!"
8,"I’m a small town gay &amp; this summer went alone to New York for World Pride, San Francisco for Dore Alley, and Chicago for Market Days. Here’s what I learned (Pics inside) [NSFW]


Note: I realize I wrote a lot. I split up the different events in their section with their own album with pictures, so if you’re interested in one just scroll down. Please know this is NSFW


This summer I went to World Pride in New York, Dore Alley in San Francisco, and Market Days in Chicago. And if you’re anything like I was, you have absolutely no idea what any of these things are. They’re all big, tourist-trap parties for primarily gay men. Two years ago I was still in the closet, so to say I went to all three of these events this summer completely alone is mind boggling. I’ve learned some things about gayborhoods that I, a small town gay, didn’t realize before.

[I live in a part of Iowa where sometimes the closet person on Grindr is 50 miles away](https://www.reddit.com/r/grindr/comments/c1yxma/guess_ill_go_fuck_myself/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app). Every gay at my university knows each other (even the closeted guys), and we all simultaneously fuck and hate each other. Des Moines, our capital and one of the bigger gay towns, is very cliqueish and no one talks outside of their friend group. It’s funny because at Pride you can tell who’s friends with who, you’ll see gaggle of gays wearing the same short shorts and rainbow ascots as if it’s attire for their gay gang.

From what I saw visiting the cities I did it’s not much different anywhere else. New York gays will boast about how great it is to live there and then turn around and do meth in their shitty apartment in Brooklyn that somehow costs thousands to rent. In Chicago I was told there’s two kind of gays that live there: in-shape guys that don’t drink to maintain their appearance yet do ecstasy and other drugs, or you have a dad bod and over drink. That’s apparently it. In San Francisco there’s something for everyone, kinky or otherwise, as long as you don’t mind the overwhelming homeless and drug problem. It’s kinda surreal to see guys in jockstraps and leather storming into Mr S Leather for an orgy and literally seeing homeless people shooting up drugs across the street. 

All that being said, this summer has been pretty fun. I’m not rich by any means. I choose the cheapest flights available to me and only stay at hostels instead of hotels, saving me hundreds. I also drove to Chicago, which is only five hours away from me. Driving wasn’t that bad by Boystown, and if you’re worried about parking, use the SpotHero app. If you ever travel to a gay Mecca, do some google searches first on events that happen there and plan your trip based on whether or not you want to attend the event.

Before I went anywhere I was kinda terrified of the idea of going to a big town alone. Growing up and watching the news I had this idea that crime was so bad in big towns that I’d get murdered if I went alone. I now realize that is dumb as fuck. Big towns are divided into smaller neighborhoods, some of these places are shadey as fuck and you’d want to avoid walking alone through them. But every major town has a gayborhood that’s safe, especially for LGBT folks: The Castro in San Francisco, Boystown in Chicago, and there’s multiple in New York. In Iowa we don’t dissect towns into neighborhoods, so that was a new idea to me which is why I mention it. 

[World Pride in New York 2019 (Click for album)](https://imgur.com/a/kt4JHyd)


World Pride is a celebration for LGBT+ individuals that happens at different places across the world, a different location every year. This year it was the 50th anniversary of the Stonewall riots (which, if you didn’t know, is credited as starting the first Pride Parade) so it was in New York City. It was, by far, the biggest Pride I’ve ever been to. The parade started at noon; when I was at a bar at 10 that night the parade was STILL GOING ON. The crowds were massive, I saw dudes twerking in jockstraps next to ladies with pasties. I was told that the police don’t care about minor public nudity in big crowds because there would be “too much paperwork” if they arrested them. 

I think some may be shocked to hear is that no one goes to the bathhouses here, apparently only tweakers go to them. Instead, there are a shit ton of sex parties. I went to one in Brooklyn with my friends called Inferno and it was kind of a surreal, magical experience. We walked down a street filled with apartments, and it seemed quiet and dead, but once we went through this unmarked metal door we entered into a whole other world. After checking in, we went down some steps and I was instantly greeted by dozens of men stripping down to nothing but their jockstraps. The thing I really liked about Inferno was that there were guys of all types: otters, muscle jocks, beefy guys, stick thin twinks- you get the idea. It was the first party I ever went to that had a dance floor next to a maze with glory holes. Looking back, it was kind of funny as fuck. I had guys coming up to me literally asking me if I could fuck them while I was talking with my friends. I was too shy, but by the end of the night I was going up to cute strangers asking if I could suck their dicks 😂

Central Park, by the way, is absolutely beautiful. When I was walking through it my friend teased me, texting me that I should try cruising in The Ramble. I’ve never gone cruising since I like not being on the sex offender list (and Grindr is easier) but for shits and giggles I walked over to at least see what this infamous place looked like. I should also note my dumb ass was also wearing my Grindr T-shirt, so I must’ve looked like a walking “FUCK ME” sign. As soon as I got to The Ramble- and I kid you fucking not- I was not even there for two minutes, this dude slowly walked passed me giving me the most uncomfortable stare down IN MY LIFE. Something in my gut told me he was cruising me, and I just nope’d out of there. 

But other than going to sex parties and cruising, New York overall is a fun place- if you can ignore all of the honking. I recommend checking out the The Met and the Guggenheim (I saw Guillermo Diaz there! He’s the actor that pours milk on himself in Britney Spears’ music video for I Wanna Go. He was checking out dick photographs by one of my favorite artists, Robert Mappelthorpe.) New York is a fun experience because you can hear four different languages on one block. My best advice for New York is this: make sure you know what fucking subway you’re on. I wasted a couple of hours not realizing I was going uptown when I wanted to go downtown. Even people that live here get it confused sometimes! (At least that’s what my friends told me to make me feel better)



[Market Days in Chicago](https://imgur.com/a/rh6wJCA)

Market Days was the latest celebration I went to. If you’re the kind of person that posts shirtless selfies on Instagram and get 300+ likes, you’ll love Market Days. But, if you’re like me, and unfortunately don’t look like you’re sculpted by Michelangelo, you’ll basically go unnoticed. Market Days is a huge tourist trap for Chicago. From what I understand, every neighborhood in Chicago has a little festival. Market Days is the neighborhood festival for Boystown, making it a big gay attraction. Market Days isn’t inherently a gay thing, and attracts things other than LGBT, but because it’s in a spot with lots of gay bars, it’s pretty damn gay. ([And even tho there are children here, you’ll see things like this sometimes](https://twitter.com/ryanrosexxx/status/1163949559124582400?s=21).)

I was nervous about driving to Chicago, picturing lots of traffic, but once I reached my parking garage I felt underwhelmed. The most terrifying part about driving to Chicago were the tollbooths. I’ve never had to pay to drive on a road. Absolutely horrifying. I stayed at Wrigley Hostel, which isn’t far from Wrigley Field, where the Cubs play. ([And if you’re like me and watch too many videos on PornHub, apparently where the “Wrigleyville Cumdump” lives](https://www.pornhub.com/view_video.php?viewkey=ph5a5008d722297).) Wrigley Field is only a couple of blocks away from Boystown, where all of the gay bars are. And yes, there is a bathhouse on literally the same street as these bars.

As a small town Iowa gay that’s visited San Francisco and New York before I went to Chicago, the best thing I can say about Market Days is that it’s the place where midwest gays go to pretend they have a personality. Is that a bit harsh? I spent a night with a local Chicagoan and he told me the same thing- Market Days are for tourists, every local he knew doesn’t even go to it. 

Personally, Market Days feels more like a beauty pageant than a celebration like Dore Alley or World Pride. Typical Pride merchandise (“PWR BTTM” and rainbow colored “FUCK ME” shirts) were being sold, so I didn’t feel like I was missing out on anything. But hordes among hordes of beautiful, waxed shirtless people filled the street and at times it became unbearable to walk fucking anywhere. I never thought I’d be so annoyed at so many hot men in my life. The bars were crowded to the point of it not looking any fun. I did see videos of the circuit parties that weekend and they looked pretty typical. 

Unlike New York, Chicago does have a bathhouse guys actually use. More than just tweakers go to this one, so that’s nice. I found my own fun that weekend so I didn’t bother going, but one guy I met told me he felt weird going. Apparently the lines were so long he decided to buy the VIP membership so he could skip ahead. VIP membership cost $120 dollars!!!! Jesus flipping titties. But once he got into the actual sauna part he felt out of place because he was the only guy with body hair. He only spent an hour or two and didn’t go back and found better luck on Grindr.

All that being said, I’d probably go again next year. For $10 you can watch five different stages of entertainment. This year I got to see Steve Grand, which was a wonderful surprise! It’s only 5 hours away from me, but I certainly wouldn’t pay a $200 ticket to fly over. I met with a group of gays that paid over $2000 to rent an apartment for a couple of days. I’d save my money and plan a trip where there’d be guys I’d be into (more otter-y and husky). But it’s a cute little shindig. Dore Alley in San Francisco, is more up my alley, and I’d feel bad for missing that!

[Dore Alley In San Francisco](https://imgur.com/a/38nBc5b) 


Dore Alley, also called Up Your Alley, is a street festival that happens every July on Folsom Street in San Francisco. Dore Alley, in my opinion, is one of the most intense parties that’s allowed to happen in public in the States. If you’re familiar with the Folsom Street Fair, you already have an idea what Dore Alley is like. I’ve been told Folsom is more touristy nowadays and Dore is dirtier and raunchier than Folsom. I don’t know if that’s true, all I know is that Dore is pretty fun.

Dore is a magical time. Every dark desire you ever had in one place. Imagine a street dance in the middle of San Francisco with guys in jockstraps and leather harnesses dancing to a DJ in broad day light. It’s not only a dance party, but places where fetishes are openly explored. Guys literally use the handkerchief code here- if you wear the color yellow, you’re into pissplay. I saw guys waiting by the portapotties offering themselves as urinals.[ One of the most shared video in the gay porn world on Twitter last month was a video of a guy getting pissed on by four muscle jocks in an alley at Dore](https://twitter.com/supergroverau/status/1155625840912158720?s=21).

But piss isn’t what makes it magical. There’s also nude twister, whipping, and this year there was a guy getting fisted too. I’m definitely not saying Dore is for everyone. Fuck, I’m not even into whipping or pissing on people. Or shoving my arm up someone’s ass- I don’t even like anal. But there’s this intense freedom of being surrounded by other gay men that just don’t give a flying fuck what you think of them or their bodies. That’s why I love it. No one gives a shit what you look like. All body types are accepted here and everyone is having a good time. That’s what I like about this. 

The thing I learned about Dore Alley is that the parties start around Thursday and go through until Sunday, but once Sunday is done all of the parties end too. It sucks how fast it goes.[ I kind of wish I went to this party at Mr S Leather, a kink store. It looked interesting- guys were literally fucking around merchandise you could buy (which might be violating some health regulations but idk lmao)](https://twitter.com/hotmeninpublic/status/1157538194856009728?s=21) There were so many parties, it was hard to keep track. There’s literally everything for everyone. After Dore I was invited to an underwear party on GROWLr at a nearby bar. I got in free because I brought my school ID. I did not expect it to be an orgy, so imagine my surprise when I walked around the corner to see guys getting fucked at the bar. Anyway, that’s how I ended up blowing four guys on the dance floor in some random bar one evening. I don’t go out to bars so it was kinda surreal for me to watch my bartender getting sucked off literally minutes after him giving me some water. 

[The reason why I went to Dore was to find an outlet for my art, dick drawings](https://twitter.com/thedickartist/status/1156766155337621507?s=21). You may remember my posts from months ago about how I drew 1000+ dicks, well I like to visit Dore and draw dicks there. I usually average out at 20 drawings every afternoon at Dore. I also drew at New York (which is how I got into Inferno for free) and Chicago too[. I have a post about my dick drawing experience this year at Dore here](https://imgur.com/a/ulcCbqC). And if you’ve been looking at my little albums from every visit, you’ll see drawings of dicks I did at New York and Chicago too :)

And before I forget, yes there is a bathhouse near San Francisco as well. BUT, it is in Berkeley, which is almost a two hour trip from The Castro. Considering my limited time, and that a lot of the fun was happening in town, I haven’t even bothered to check it out. I figured, why waste money to get in somewhere where I might someone my type, when there’s already plenty of guys my type here already? Maybe one day I’ll visit a bathhouse though. 

But San Francisco is more than just a gay sex paradise. It’s a beautiful town, if you ignore the homeless people shooting up needles in their arms (which I did see a lot of.) It can also be hit or miss weather wise. The first time I went to San Francisco it was foggy as fuck. When people think of a town in California, typically they imagine a nice and warm place, but San Francisco is anything but. It’s pretty chilly compared to most places in California. Coming from Iowa, a San Francisco summer feels like a nice autumn day in Iowa. You’d definitely want a sweater or two along with you. This year during Dore the sun was out and it actually was warm, so it really just depends.

Folsom/Dore happens in the south of market district, where there are some gay bars, but the gayborhood of San Francisco is The Castro, a couple of miles away. The Castro is pretty cool to visit, the human rights campaign store is where Harvey Milk had a shop at. Fisherman’s Wharf is also one of my favorite places to walk through. Everything was too pricey for me, but I did wait in line at In and Out for forty minutes for a $8 burger and fries combo (and got a shirt.) Chinatown is beautiful, and I love checking out the museums here too. This year the weather was great and I walked to the Golden Gate Bridge too. I did not realize this until this year, but there’s a nude beach next to the Bridge called Marshall’s beach. Mainly gay men go to it and it ends up being a big cruising ground. My friend claims he once saw a 10 person orgy at the beach. Sadly when I visited the tide was too high, meaning the ocean was coming up so high on the shore there was no comfortable place to stand. A good portion of Marshall’s Beach is sharp rock, so if the tide is too high no one will want to bare their butts.[ Just look at this porn that was filmed their- sitting there doesn’t look comfortable in my opinion whatsoever. ](https://twitter.com/cumblr2/status/1159421102113742848?s=21)

Looking back at what I wrote it feels like I just wrote about sex parties. This is something that surprised me as a small town gay- everything in bigger towns seems to be all about sex. Dore Alley is sexual by default; but Market Days And World Pride both had events where you could watch guys fuck on stage- at a regular bar. I didn’t realize how sexually open bigger towns were. It does make me wish there were more “non-sexual but gay” parties out there. If anyone knows any I’d love to hear them!

Visiting bigger towns always makes me feel so bittersweet. I realize how lonely I really am living where I do. Yet at the same time, I hate big towns and feel like they suck the life out of you. The worst part is that I end up meeting someone great but then realize the possibility of ever having a life with them is nonexistent. So then when the trip is over, and I’m back home where the closet gay bar is over an hour away, I can’t but to wonder what will really make me happy in life. I love small towns, and everyone treats everyone like family here, but will I ever be able to find a partner if I stay here? 

That being said, next year I’d love to go to Southern Decadence (it’s basically gay Mardi Gras- except of flashing titties guys show their junk), Provincetown in Massachusetts, or something called Otter Days (I think) in Texas. What’s the best “gay event” you’ve ever gone to? Are there any other small town gays here that recently took a gaycation? What were your thoughts on visiting a place with a bigger gay population for the first time? What’s your favorite gay activity/thing to do in New York, Chicago or San Francisco (it doesn’t even have to be gay related.) What town do you want to visit? I’d love to go to Spain (Yo entiendo un poco espanol pero no mucho) and Berlin in Germany sounds like a fun place to visit!

I hope at least someone finds my little adventure interesting :)"
9,"my hookup was so sensual and wholesome, i'm touched ;')


i am a bottom and many of my past hookups have been guys that are pretty dominant and a bit rough. I think its because I kind of like getting used and abused? but sometimes i think it would be nice to try something different

but anyway, I met up with someone today and he was the complete opposite of all of the other guys that I hooked up with. he was sooooo sweet and cute! I came over to his house and he was incredibly attentive to how comfortable I was. he asked me if I wanted any water, whether or not the ac was too cold for me, or if he could just do anything to make me feel more safe and snug. i was expecting that once we got to his house, we would start having the sexy time right away, but he actually wanted to talk and get to know me better. so weird! 

after talking for a while about interests and other things, he invited me to his bedroom and we talked some more and listened to some music while we cuddled. I was so happy to be in his arms, it felt like he was my boyfriend and we have been dating for some time. and then he kissed me. he's a reallyyy good kisser! his lips were so soft and he kissed me so tenderly and slowly. everyone that I kissed in the past just tends to default to a sucking action and its not really enjoyable... 

then afterward, he started to kiss me all over my body! what! he kissed my nipples, nibbled on my ear, rubbed his nose against mine, bit my fingers, kissed my inner thigh, licked me here and there. gahhhh im gushing just thinking about it. its never been this way for me before. its always been just a dick getting shoved up my ass or mouth.... oh, and he looked so cute while he was giving me a blowjob! and when he penetrated me, he was so gentle with it, oh my gosh. he was constantly asking me if I was comfortable, if it hurt, etc.

i honestly don't know where I am going with this post. I am just so touched that he was so sweet and gentle with me, always being thoughtful about how I felt. everything was just so vanilla about it that even now I am so happy!!!!"
10,"I just started college... And EVERYONE is hot


Ok maybe not *everyone*, but the vast majority. Why did no one warn me about this? The school I'm going to is full on nerfs, myself included. I was not expecting so many people to catch my eye. Even my roommate is kinda good looking.


I've legitimately seen guys who could be like Disney actors.

How do I keep myself from staring at guys that I come across on campus? Once I've noticed this, it's so hard to look away.

11,"Drunkenly came out to my friend last night


Downed 5 bottles of soju in less than 2 hours and got absolutely hammered. I vaguely remember telling him but wasn’t sure if it was my imagination or not. I asked him about it this morning over text and he said he remembered and he will always be my friend. Feels good to get it of my chest!"
12,"Got outed at party, different type of outing.


I was at a bbq this weekend, in backyard full 20 people. I was standing next to the table that was next to the grill. My friends bf was grilling and she was setting  8 plates with the buns, he was going to plate the burgers. She pointed to all the bottom buns for him to lay the burgers on. Bottom, bottom, bottom and then as she gets to the end of the table bops me on the fucking nose and says bottom! WTF, everyone started laughing and my friend’s boyfriend said I knew it! I was so embarrassed but a hunky guy who came over to get a burger gave me a ass slap and said don’t worry about it lol.  So that was worth it. Later I made friends with a girl and she said she wanted to set me up on a blind date with her co-worker. She whispered to me, he’s a top and winked at me. 

How was everyone else’s weekend?"

15,"Is it just me or do gay clubs feel like high school all over again


I'm 23 so I'm supposed to be out of that age when you give a fuck about what other people think of you, like in high school when being hot and popular according to other people's perception of you was the most important thing in the world. All of that goes out the window when I step foot into a gay club and I suddenly go back to that insecure school boy who feels reduced to his appearance. Same-sex attraction is what made us a community in the first place, that physical attractiveness becomes a hot commodity that determines your place in the pecking order doesn't seem surprising. We all know what the guys of the gay community living their best life being the centre of attention look like. So enter a gay club and it feels like it's high school all over again. Not that I'm blaming anyone, it is what it is and not the end of the world, just stating what that feeling reminded me of."

17,"Unpopular Opinion: Some of you need to take responsibility for your lives.


I see a lot of comments from guys on this sub talking about how many problems they have with the gay community whether it’s how shallow guys are or how mean gays are to one another or how masculine men should want to date feminine men and so on and so forth.

A lot of you seem to believe that the problems you seem to have with dating or with gay men in general are everyone else’s fault, but you never seem to take yourself into account. If you think the gay community is shallow because no one will date you, but you’re morbidly obese or have terrible hygiene and aren’t doing anything to take care of yourself or present yourself in a way that may make you seem desirable to someone else that’s your own fault.

If you complain about masculine men not wanting to date feminine guys, but spend most of your time with them complaining about other people in your life or being otherwise catty you should look at your own behavior. If you’re trying to pick up jocks, but you hate sports and have no interest in sharing in any of their hobbies look at yourself. It’s not that they’re masculine and hate fem guys. They just aren’t interested in you.

If you complain about how mean the gay community is, but take everything that’s said to you as an insult or go out of your way to be as abrasive as possible to everyone you meet you are the problem.

In short.. some of you need to take a long hard look at yourselves and stop blaming other gays for all of your issues."
18,"Oregon DHS ruling: Gay couple loses their nephew to strangers


A baby, born in the state of Oregon in 12/2016. Born to parents who were plagued by the temptations of drugs and chaos in life. The parents were deemed unfit and the child was removed from their care while at the hospital. The child was also born with a mild addiction to the drugs his mother had used during her pregnancy. The child made a remarkable recovery and the day he left the hospital, no one could tell that he had just single handedly beaten one of the biggest plagues in our nation, as a newborn he was able to get “clean.” 

The child’s father was a kind soul before he got mixed up with the wrong crowd and made a couple wrong life decisions. He came from a loving family, a tight knit group of folk who lived the simple life of working to provide for their families. This newborn, though technically parentless, had an entire loving paternal family that wanted to get to know him, a family full of uncles, aunts, grandparents, great uncles and great uncles, cousins, everyone. Most importantly, the child had a loving uncle who wanted to care for him. In the child’s favor, he was related to this uncle, but maybe not in his favor, the uncle was in a same sex marriage and maybe thats what took this case into the far depths of wrongness. The child’s uncles were ready to bring him home the day he left the hospital to care for him, to raise him as their own.

Instead, the child was sent to foster care. He landed in a home promised to be housing his half siblings (same mother but different fathers). Indeed, these siblings would have provided a good support system, but instead, the siblings left that foster home 1 week after the child was placed. Oregon refused to consider kinship care or a family resource even when the child’s uncles were readily available to bring him home. Oregon opted to use government funds on a child who had family that wanted him rather than spend the money towards a child that had no one around, who had no family. They kept this child in foster care, paid this foster family to keep the child in an unknown home, and actively kept the child away from his very capable paternal family and gay uncles.

After 2 years of fighting and reaching out to simply meet their nephew, the couple was finally registered as a certified foster home. The delay of 2 years was due to active refusal of Oregon to supply the necessary paperwork for the couple’s home to be approved. The delay also came between the 3 different social workers that were removed and reassigned to the case due to the prior one’s inadequacies. 

After years of constant barraging of DHS, the uncles were finally able to meet their nephew for the first time… not because DHS allowed it, but rather in court where the uncles were not even informed about but had to find out about it by their hired lawyer. The social worker for the case opted to not tell the uncles of the majority of court dates over the years in hopes to defile the gay couple’s image in front of the judge and in front of their own nephew. After DHS had actively kept the uncles from seeing their nephew, now the argument is the child has bonded and lived with the foster family for too long to be removed from their home. 

Now, the system has turned the tables and blames the gay uncles for not fighting hard enough, for not speaking up enough, for being in a same sex marriage that caused the lengthy permancy of this child. The numerous saved emails over the last 2.5 years between the couple and DHS say otherwise. Everything they could do was financially limited and maybe that is why it was not enough for DHS to reunite the uncles with their nephew. The couple hired a lawyer who was restricted within his jurisdiction. They reached out to the Oregon Governor’s Advocacy who had to replace the acting social worker on this case 3 times and still nothing changed with each worker. They offered to take their nephew home from the beginning with no strings attached, no need for monthly stipends, no need for governmental assistance, no need for unnecessary resources being used for a child who had loving family.

Today on 8/21/2019, 2.5 years later the news was finalized, the foster family was given the official rights to adopt this child because DHS had kept him in this home and never considered the child’s own uncles as a resource home. It was finalized that this child will never get to know his paternal family even if they lived down the street. It was finalized that it was another step away from this loving gay couple to have children of their own. They weren’t even allowed to bring home their own blood nephew, let alone another foster child of no relation. This fight was a damper for the family. The child’s paternal side mourned this loss. This fight was absolutely a step back for true family values, a violation of the supposed “reuniting families as a priority” motto, and a slap in the face for LGBTQ+ families who are able and willing to raise a loving family. Nothing can right this wrong, but their story can shine a light on the shortcomings of this system. A system where money is spent on children who have families who are capable to care for them, while allowing kids who have no family fend for themselves.  "
