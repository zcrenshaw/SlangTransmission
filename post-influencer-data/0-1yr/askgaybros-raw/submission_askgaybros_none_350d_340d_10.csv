1,"Do guys really give better blowjobs than girls?


I saw a post on another sub from some dude complaining about how he hates blowjobs because girls always use their teeth and it hurts. I commented that I was gay and all my blowjobs have been pretty great and maybe most girls are just bad at oral. I just got downvotes from all the straight guys in the thread so I thought I’d see if you guys feel the same? I’ve never been with a girl, but my experiences with oral sex have been pretty damn good.

2,"Earlier today I saw a gay couple walking down the street holding hands, which made my day because of its wholesomeness, have you ever gotten talked to negatively because you did this in public?

3,"Is he gay? Or just a touchy, cute straight friend? I'm losing my mind...


I feel should start by saying I'm a closeted gay in high school. I've known this guy, who I'll call Dylan, for about two years now, and for the past year I've been thinking about him almost every day. However, I just have no idea how he feels about me. We hug and touch a lot, and I feel we look each other in the eyes longer than most guys would. But then he'll do things that just make me wonder if he's actually gay, or just really... touchy? I don't really know how to explain it. Let me just go into more detail.

When we first met, we were on the wrestling team. I was a sophomore and he was a freshman. I didn't talk to him much and I didn't think about him ""like that"" (Thinking back, I keep wondering how I didn't think he was cute at the time).

Then comes football season. We still don't really talk to each other much. It wasn't until the first game night that I started to have thoughts about him. Before walking down to the field before the game, everyone was told to pair up so that the team would walk toward the field in two lines side by side. After I failed to get a partner of my own (I'm a pretty quiet kid), Dylan comes up to me and offers to walk with me, which I (gladly) agreed to. While walking down towards the field, we're told to hold hands with the person next to us (I still don't get why we did this. I guess to show unity and teamwork?). So, Dylan, without hesitation, grabs my hand and our fingers interlock. I look up in to his eyes, and he's staring back at me. We just stared at each other for about 5 seconds, until some guy behind us told us to stop interlocking fingers because it was gay. That broke off the stare and we ""corrected"" our hands. After this, Dylan started to pop up in my mind more often than other guys. . Every game for the rest of the season, Dylan and I made a deal to always partner up when walking towards or leaving the game field. Whenever someone couldn't find a partner to walk with and tried asking me to walk, Dylan would always tell them to ""back off my man"". When someone tried taking him as a partner, I stepped in and took Dylan back. This prompted him to say ""huh, I guess you actually do care about me"". I probably should've said something, but I just laughed about it.

So this continues for the rest of the season, and eventually Dylan and me start talking more and hanging out outside of school with other friends. Wrestling season comes around again, but he didn't join the team that year. But in December, Dylan, me, and 4 other people decide to go paint balling. During the trip, I would catch him staring at me every now and then. After playing, we decided to get pizza. We sat at booths. Dylan sits down and I go to sit down next to him. I joked about how I got to sit next to my favorite person here, while going to lean on him, but Dylan laughed and said ""I'm not gay man"" while also moving away (kind of broke my heart). So there it is, he just told me he's not gay right? But there's more.

More stuff happens and it's like the end of January. Dylan and I still talk and see each other as we walk through the hall way and at the end of the day, but less because we only have football together (after all this time, I still don't even have his number). Dylan and one of our friends decided to sneak up on me and pretty much hug the crap out of me. It happened on random day, until it eventually started to happen every time we saw each other. For the first week since it started Dylan would only do it when the other friend did it with him, but even when that friend stopped, Dylan continued to do it. It also turned from ""surprise hugs"" to just hugs as we passed by each other in the hallway or at the end of the day. We even started running up to each other just to hug for a couple of seconds. 

And the whole ""staring into each other eyes for longer than normal"" thing also started again. There are a couple moments in particular that stand out to me. After a hug in the hallway and a short talk, we both started to walk away, but I looked back over my shoulder and saw him looking right back at me, and he shouted ""see you after school!"" And we held the gaze for a while until I turned the corner to keep walking. Another time, the very last day of school, we were sitting next to each other in gym and we were talking about scheduling or something for next year. The conversation went quiet for a bit, but I turned my head to look at him, and he looked right back at me. This felt different to all the other times he looked at me. A wave of happiness surged throughout my body as we just sat and smiled at each other for what felt like an eternity. The bell eventually rang and we went our separate ways.

Summer starts again and all the football players are weightlifting in the school. Our coaches make us do these neck exercises that require a partner. Dylan and I instantly partner up for these, and instead of doing the exercise, we mostly just fool around (tickling each other, shoving, more stares, etc.). He kept making jokes about wanting to wrestle me again. At one point we start doing running drills outside in the heat, so some people started going shirtless. Some friends, and Dylan, kept trying to get me to go shirtless with them (Dylan never went shirtless). I eventually did, and Dylan stared for a good while at my body, before rolling up his sleeves and asking if I thought he was hot, which I flat out told him ""Yea you are"". 

So I just realized how much I wrote, so I'm just going to bullet point other reasons as to why I think he's gay.

* I've never heard him mention anything about liking girls at all. Only once (like a week ago), as a cheerleader was walking by he said ""I think I could mac it to her"". 
* We still hug, touch (grabbing my arms, arm around shoulder, etc.), and stare everyday.
* We joke about loving each other and he makes jokes about me taking him to prom. (One friend said we looked like butt buddies).
* Last year, during cold football games (like 75% of the games), we would huddle together just to keep warm (Pretty much us hugging each other while shivering in the cold).
* He's been starting to get more ""cuddly"". Ex: For one football game this year we sat next to each other on the bus. He leaned his head on my shoulder and I put my head on his. We stayed like this for a while before he got up. Then he did it again a couple minutes later, this time I hugged him and rubbed his stomach, and he let me. Ex (2):  Couple days later we we're sitting in an auditorium next to each other. He put his arm around my shoulder and I rested my head on his shoulder. That stopped until he put his head on my shoulder, my head on his. (Like straight friends don't do this right?)
* Still jokes about wanting to wrestle me.
* This year the football team doesn't hold hands while walking towards the game anymore. Like a week ago, before walking down to the game, he brought up how he remembers, and misses, holding my hand while walking. He even grabbed my hand again with fingers interlocked, but we didn't walk the whole way like that.

I really do like him, and thinking about him makes me excited just to go to school and football practice. When he's not there, I get this bad weird feeling in my body and my whole mood feels off. Honestly, if he wasn't on the football team I would have probably quit already, and I'm already thinking about leaving the wrestling team because he said he doesn't want to wrestle this year either (which is why him joking about wrestling me gets me thinking about stuff...).

So here I am now, writing about all the reasons why I think he's gay. I want to believe he's gay, but I just keep thinking about me being wrong. I want to ask him but I just don't know how to go about it because we are never really alone together. I don't even know his phone number or how I would get that. What do you guys think? Is he gay or not? and if he is, how do I go about going further with him?

Sorry for the long post, I've never really written one of these before. I haven't even really started going on reddit until a couple days ago, but the community seems awesome."
4,"Am I weird for crying during my first time?


Not because it hurt, but because it felt so good feeling my bare skin against his. He was extremely gentle and caring since he knew it was my first time. For once in my life, I felt so safe and loved. And good. I started crying and he freaked out, because he thought he had done something wrong..I assured him that I was OK. 

This is the only time I actually felt uncomfortable around him, because I just ruined the moment and made myself look like an idiot.

6,"Boyfriend thinks he might be asexual


Last night we were talking and the boyfriend confided that he might be asexual. We agreed to take a two week break from sex to let him figure things out. We also agreed that if he is asexual that we'd open up the relationship so I could still have sex. The thing is, i dont really want to have sex with other people. I dont know what to do. Anyone been in a relationship with an asexual male and opened things up here? How did it work out?"

8,"Does anyone else accidentally say “I love you” during sex??


I do it all the time and I can’t stop doing it. I’ll be balls deep in someone and just blurt out “I fucking love you” and I don't mean it, but they always look really confused and ask a lot of questions and I have to convince people that I’m just an idiot and didn't mean it. Its exhausting and Im thinking of getting hypnotized to stop doing that."
9,"I love butts


Small tangent because I'm sexually frustrated right now. There's this guy at my gym, one of my gym crushes actually, and holy crap does he have a nice ass. It's jiggly but not too fat, not super firm but still has shape, it's just... perfect. Ugh, I legit stare at it every time he walks by, I just want to use it as a pillow 😭"

11,"Does anyone else not hook up with guys hotter than them because it makes them feel inferior?


I recently broke things off with my fwb because having sex with him made me feel self-conscious. He's ripped, 6'1, well hung, and handsome. I should have been very pleased but everytime we were together I was hyper aware of every flaw on my body from the small bulge in my stomach I can't get to completely disappear, to the hyperpigmentation on my legs from when I fucked up epilating and got some in-grown hairs. I felt so ugly next to him I couldn't understand how he possibly found me attractive. He wanted us to be exclusive but I felt like he could do so much better than me.

I feel conflicted because I did like him. He started our relationship and seemed drawn to me from the beginning. We texted back and forth for a long time before meeting. He bought us tea the  first time we met. He was so handsome and sweet that after we finished, I immediately took him back to my place, tore his clothes off, got on my knees and gave it up. He was the first guy I let fuck me. 

I guess the ""It's not you, it's me,"" excuse works here? I seem to feel better meeting guys with more flaws. I like average to slightly chubby guys who aren't are as primmed as my fwb, and are more modestly endowed. I feel valuable with them. Am I fucking myself over?"
12,"Do you ever see guys posting on the cock subreddits talking about girls and think ""There's maybe 2 girls who are gonna see this.""?

13,"VOTE BLUE IN THE 2018 MIDTERM


Seriously guys, everything hinges on this. The court that gave us marriage rights will soon have a conservative majority and Trump has slammed and hurt LGBT people all over the country. 

He's a lying, corrupt sack of shit who deserves to be exposed. If democrats win the house, they kill any conservative agenda instantly and have the power to investigate everything about Trump, including his tax returns, Russia, and his business dealings.  If they win the senate, they can stop any Trump nominees that need senate approval, including for the courts. VOTE BLUE. No matter where you are, even if the race seems decided. "
14,"In your opinion, what’s the least attractive personality trait someone could have?


I had been drinking with friends the other night and we started playing fuck, marry, kill. I first said marry for one friend (guy), since he is studying to be a doctor and is always a great drinking buddy. Then, I had to decide between another guy friend and a girl friend. Everyone thought I’d kill the girl, but I said fuck because, in my opinion, the guy whines a little too much, which is a HUGE turn off for me. The whinny guy didn’t understand, since I’m gay, and I tried explaining to him that I just don’t find whininess of any kind attractive at all. In fact, I hate whining. 

So, yeah. Funny story. Different strokes, different folks. What’s the one personality trait you find as an instant boner-killer? "
15,"I told my evangelical Christian mom I've never seen a black penis (we're black)


So my mom and I were having an argument about my sexuality the other day. She was telling me how wrong it was, that I'd get all sorts of diseases, and that I'd never be accepted in black community. I casually threw out there I'm the opposite of Khole Kardashian in that I've never seen a black penis. We keep up with the Kardashians so she got the reference. Khole says she's never seen a white one. I say I've never seen a black one.

My mom dramatically throws her hands up and starts doing some sort of loud holy roller prayer in tongues, pleading with Jesus. I felt bad at first because she's kinda old and sickly. I'm in my 20s but I was the last born. Her reaction surprised me because I couldn't figure out if she was more upset I'd been messing around with penises or that the penises I'd been messing around with were all white. Huh, who knows. She had it coming."
