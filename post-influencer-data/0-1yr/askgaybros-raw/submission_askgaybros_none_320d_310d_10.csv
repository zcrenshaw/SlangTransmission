0,"Help! Always getting rashes/pimples forming on my butt after removing the hair. No matter the method or no matter what I do after removing it. Does anyone else have/had the same problem?


A few pics of my butt, I've used depilating cream 2 days ago, but the rash will get worse [NSFW]:
[picture1](https://imgur.com/NpySzDL) and [picture2](https://imgur.com/cyYCuoh). You can even see some pimples from the last time I've removed the hair (over 2 months ago).

I've tried shaving with a razor, same results. I've tried using lotions, powders, showering 5 times a day, even applying dry deodorant on my butt 10 times a day. Still, nothing worked.

Usually I shave my other body parts with razor and shaving cream, but the only place I get rashes at is my butt. Since I get pimples no matter what, I just prefer to use the hair removal cream now on my butt, since it removes all the hair and leaves my skin smooth for a day. 

Does anyone know anything else I could try? Or what is even happening, why I get these rashes and only on my butt?"

2,"Cumming while flaccid?


So this is....interesting. 

I hooked up with a guy yesterday night wherein I went over to his place and gave him a blowjob.  Now, I‚Äôve only ever had great feedback on my blowjob skills (lol) so I was pretty confident going into this.  However, when I was on my knees, praying orally to Jesus, I was starting to feel insecure because the guy didn‚Äôt get hard.  At.  All.

I wanted to keep trying so I kept going, and he kept making approving statements (fuck yeah, just like that etc.) but he kept continuing to be flaccid.  I was feeling down on myself, with his dick in my mouth still lol, and then something happened: 

‚ÄúOh fuck!‚Äù

He came.  And he was as limp as a cooked noodle.  

Afterwards, I rinsed with mouthwash in his bathroom and exchanged goodbyes, to which he said, ‚Äúkeep in touch‚Äù and winked at me and I‚Äôm just here like ????

How does this happen?  Has anything happened like this to y‚Äôall?  The human body is a mysterious thing.  "

5,"Straight guy but wanna try something new


Hey everyone, so I haven‚Äôt done anything with another guy and I‚Äôve never really thought of it before, but recently I‚Äôve been wanting to do everything to guys. I don‚Äôt feel attracted to random guys I see but I still have the ‚Äúthirst‚Äù for some D for some reason. I was wondering how I would go ahead and meet people for only sexual relations and how do some gay people feel about being with someone who is completely new at it (probably different for everyone)?"

7,"How to pace a LTR?


I met the cutest guy ever, we just had our second date yesterday. It was so fun, we had great food and talked for hours, then he had to get going so I walked with him back to his apartment and we hugged and I just wanted to grab his face and pull him in for a kiss but instead we finished the hug and I looked at how beautiful he was as we both kept pulling back until we waved bye. 

I think I went too fast with the first guy I started talking to in college, and he got cold feet. I don't want to mess things up with this guy too. He's slow to text but always seems like he's having a great time when we meet up and when we do text we're quick to schedule a time to meet up again. Any tips on how to pace out this relationship since I don't want to be too much or too needy or anything but I also just want to kiss him forever and want him in my bed right now. üò´"

9,"How do I stop letting the past control my thoughts?


So, a month or two ago I was worried that my boyfriend was hiding something from me. So I went through his messages (yes, i fully understand that this was wrong &amp; an invasion of privacy) but I just had a gut feeling there was something happening that i didn‚Äôt know about. I had previous trust issues before being with him, and I didn‚Äôt think he would do anything to betray my trust. 

So as it turns out, he had been hanging out with his ex behind my back and drove 4 hours to see his other ex. In both text message threads with his exes, there were messages that I perceived to be flirtatious. He swears up and down that he didn‚Äôt cheat on me, and I believe him for the most part. But I can‚Äôt stop thinking about the messages and the fact that he went behind my back. He still gets together with one of them occasionally for coffee, &amp; I try to be as understanding about it as I can. Part of me feels like it‚Äôs my fault somehow. Like, maybe he isn‚Äôt getting everything he needs out of his relationship with me. I‚Äôve talked to him about that &amp; he promised me he feels fulfilled being with me. I just want to stop thinking abut it &amp; letting it get to me. 

This guy means so much to me, and I don‚Äôt want to push him away by being so worried all the time. I try to stay in a positive mindset but some days it‚Äôs harder than others. If anyone has any advice at all, it would be greatly appreciated! 

Thanks gaybros!"
10,"When encountering guys FIRST in person


Most of us unfortunately have to heavily rely on online interactions as our first encounter before agreeing to meet in person. My question is, who all here can tell of a time when you met a guy FIRST in person, who had it been online, you probably would have assumed not to have been your type and you wouldn't have bothered? I know for me going off my social media alone, most assume I'm more feminine then I actually am. When I meet a guy they usually always say ""You're a lot more chill then I was expecting."" or ""Your voice is actually a lot deeper then I figured it would be."" It goes to show we judge a book way too hard on the cover, where if we were just able to give each other a quick chance, I think we'd be surprised just who we found attractive. "
11,"Life advice


Hello all, I don‚Äôt know if this is the right section to ask this but I‚Äôm reaching out with the hopes that anyone can help me, give me his thoughts or whatever you think can help. I am 26 years old and I recently came out (about 4 months ago) , obviously these past months have been a deep mix of emotions coming from all sides and I am still coming to terms with it all. I just recently moved to a new place as well and up to now I don‚Äôt have any gay friends/gay scene life as well‚Ä¶

Point is : I decided to download Tinder and even though I‚Äôve had some matches nothing has turned into dating / meeting more people and this has lead me to think (I know it may not be rational or anything) to think maybe I‚Äôm too ugly for the gay scene?
 I really have this idolized version of dating someone (as a in Taylor Swift song lol ) and maybe I‚Äôm a hopeless romantic but then thinking I might spend the following years alone completely breaks me. Any thoughts? "
12,"Breaking casual dates off: call versus text


So I've been casually going on dates with a few guys for the past month or two. None of them were really anything serious, but one wants to properly date me, and I want to date him, but I don't know how to end it with the other ones. I've only talked with all of them by text, so I feel like a call would be kind of out of the blue (and transparently bad), but then again, I also feel like people like voice communication on these things, even if I'd probably honestly just rather avoid it to keep from backing down. Any thoughts or advice?

&amp;#x200B;

I'd rather give them some closure, though I guess ghosting is also an option too, but it seems pretty rude."

14,"Any other gay guys ever sometimes feel guilty after watching porn?


Sometimes I‚Äôll watch some little twink starting out in the business get impaled by some older guy and think it‚Äôs so hot. And then after I get off I sometimes feel kinda bad and think ‚Äúthis guy just ruined his future. The only thing he has to look forward to is prostitution and more extreme and sleazier porn.‚Äù Its like, I know nothing about this guy or how he feels about his life, but I just saw him deep throat a 12 inch cock and open up his asshole for the whole world to see. And then I think, ‚Äúwhy is he doing this, and why am I doing this?‚Äù"
15,"Halloween (Wednesday) at gay bars?


My wife and I wanna go to a gay bar on Halloween. I‚Äôm bi and enjoy some time in queer spaces but get unreasonably uneasy/nervous for some reason, so the idea of wearing a costume sounds easier. I can‚Äôt find any actual events for Wednesday night though, only the Saturday before. (I was away so couldn‚Äôt go then.) Is it safe to assume I could swing by any of the gay clubs in NYC and there‚Äôll be people in costumes? Or is it really only a weekend thing?"
