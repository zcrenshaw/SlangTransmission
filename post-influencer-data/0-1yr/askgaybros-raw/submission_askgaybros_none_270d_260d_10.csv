0,"My housemate is sleeping with a woman!


35 yo GWM here.  I share a house with three other gay dudes.  Like a lot of gay guys, we are very open in our sexuality -- we've all had sex with each other, talk freely about our adventures, walk around in the nude, hang out with our lovers.  It is an all-male household!

Several months ago, my housemate David began an affair with a female co-worker, Karen.  (I had no idea that he was bi, and if I had, I would never have allowed him to live with us).  They are now exclusive.   I hear them fucking regularly.  They are affectionate around the other housemates -- they do not see how they are hurting us through this conduct.  I don't know how they can be so inconsiderate!

&amp;#x200B;

Karen now spends a lot of time at our house.  She doesn't walk around in the nude, but she does hang in bra and panties.  (I think she does enjoy the eye candy -- gross!)  I think that David must be expelled from our house, but my housemates disagree.  What can I do to save our household from the menace of this woman!"

3,"Going to a gay club for the first time.


Hey guys, I hope you are having a great day! 

This year has been really good for me, I lost a ton of weight (which has helped me a lot to improvise my self confidence) and i have fully accepted my homosexuality. 

So I have decided to go to Madrid with some friends and I have decided to go to Chueca for the first time, for the ones who don’t know, Chueca is a neighborhood in Madrid full of gay bars and clubs. 

The thing is, I have never been to a gay bar, so I would like some advice please. 

Thanks for reading 😊"
4,"A silly question about boner


So I can’t help notice that some guy have boner in the gym when they do pull ups, sit ups or running. I am not being creepy or anything but I just see it. However, in my own experience, my penis is shrinking instead of erecting when I workout, especially after running. 

So my question is, which is the normal way? brothers."

7,"I have never been this motivated in my life!


Two days ago I confirmed a guy I had been seriously crushing on for the past few weeks was straight. I was devastated. Today, to avoid thinking about it I: Went to the gym by myself (which I rarely do) and worked out for an hour, worked on my senior thesis, did 100 push ups outside of the gym while studying in between, had lunch and caught up with one friend, played some multiplayer games with another, and watched some TV with another friend.

I now understand Season 5 Parks and Rec Chris Traeger. Constantly keeping busy is the only remedy to take my mind off an impossible crush..."

9,"My partner's going through a hard time and I feel bad for considering breaking up?


Over the past month or so, I've been having a relationship crisis and not sure whether to break up with my boyfriend of almost a year. I still love and care about him a lot, but it feels like more how a friend would care about a friend than a romantic relationship. Part of me feels like I'm doing him a disservice staying together because we both deserve to find people who we feel romantically attracted to.

The problem is that it's been almost a year since we've been dating and I feel like he feels like everything's fine. He'll say things like ""I want to be yours forever"" or ""you're the perfect person for me, I never thought I'd find someone like you"" and it just makes me feel so guilty because I don't feel that. It's like I went numb for his affection all of the sudden and IDK why.

But he's also really depressed right now since it's the three year anniversary since one of his parents died and because his last partner left him at about the year mark. He has a history of self-harm and suicide attempts, too, and (not to be egotistical) I worry that if we broke up now, it could send him into a spiral of hurting himself and I still want him to be happy and I don't want to hurt him. Plus, he's unemployed and isn't going to school right now (though he's hoping to go back to school soon) so he doesn't get out much and I'm worried that if I wasn't around anymore, he'd just fall into a deeper depression than he already is in.

I've talked about some of this with him before, but I feel like it makes him feel like he's doing something wrong or needs to be a better partner and it's not that. He's an amazing and kind and sweet partner, I just feel like I'm all numb inside and don't feel romantic attraction anymore. And IDK, sometimes I can see things working out and us being happy together but sometimes, I don't and I don't know what to do.

What would you do in this situation? I just really don't know what to do and care about him a lot, but I also don't know that I love him in a romantic way before. I know you don't know me, but do you possibly have any advice for this situation?"

11,"I am accepting I am gay, I have had the strongest denial for years, just wanted to write my thoughts, and say hello


For years I have been dressing as a girl convincingly and getting flooded with dick pics, its fun, I thought it was funny to do it, never used to think anything of it, then I started to realise that all the pictures on my phone where dicks and i'd be like ""woah better delete all these pictures, what the hell"". It's been a continual cycle for years and it's finally started to click. I even had a boyfriend in school for a day, should of been a clue but I chalked it up as 'sexual apathy'. When craigslist sex was a thing I used to meet guys and get them off in there cars ""just an opportunity thing"". I would say, ""I mean I don't actually like all the cum in my mouth, that's gross, I just like the attention! It's less stressful to get offf guys anyway!"". I even went as far as to wear a chastity cage so I could say to myself ""I met up with a guy to get him off and didn't get hard, not gay"". After a while I started to accept the fact ""I just like dick, that's all"" (the denial was strong in me lol). So when the guys took there shirts off why would I get all flustered? ""Well I am meeting up with strangers, it is embarrasing!"". I remember one time last year I met up with another guy and he called me gayboy while I was .. Ya know.. And I told him ""I am not gay"" and he looked at me with the most 'aww hahah yeah okay..' look and for some reason it turned me on. 

A memorable meet was when a guy asked if I wanted to kiss him, my thoughys - 'kiss him? Wtf no! I just wanna make him cum, I don't wanna kiss him"" .. He asks me again and it flipped ""well he must be really into it, fuck it ill kiss him"" but before I could I got really panicky and started crying and just carried on with the sexual stuff. 

Most recent meets I have been with guys with thoughts like ""he is such a nice guy, i hope he likes me"" and other scary stuff like that. It's actually becoming really hard to go because I get emotional now and sometimes have to stop myself from crying, I call myself pathetic and wander why I am being so dramatic, there is no reason to get upset, I don't even know why I am on the verge of tears most times now, except I realised I did, and it is because I wanted to kiss them but had been denying myself.

I'd think to myself I like girls though, I mean I have had girlfriends, I mean I am relieved it's been years but only because girls are so stressfull!! That it., Yeah Sarah broke up with me because she thought I was gay, she told me to just admit it. She has no idea what she is talking about, I dont even think Johnny Depp is hot, I just said I understand why girls like him and also I'm an axious person I don't always get hard it doesn't mean anything... Yeah me an Brandon had sex years ago but it was a game of dares! We were teenagers for gods sake.. Jay well, I actually don't remember I was drunk so that ones just a rumour, I have my mum thinking I am gay, I don't need it from you aswell. Yeah she thinks it cos I wear girls clothes and make up and stuff, it's just a style, my mum thinks I am a stereotype.

Not too long ago I started to really wonder, at this point I was like ""yeah boys are cute, I guess I have always known it, imagine marrying a boy? No that is crazy, I still never kissed that guy from the website, I know i'll test myself, i'll meet up with a strangers again im feeling pretty low I need some attention, I will make sure to kiss him""(still denial) I decided I didn't want to and have developed a new hobby, writing gay erotica about my co workers, I also discovered a thing called 'sissification' after googling some of the things I had done with guys. I spent weeks online searching things like ""is sissification gay??"" and the whole time I was hoping that the answer would be YES!. these days I don't even dress up, i go meet guys as a guy myself and it's fun, I don't need to dress as a girl and pretend to be humilated by being gay but i still enjoy it.

Couple of days ago I was online on an old profile of me dressed as a girl just reading old messages when a lesbian popped up thinking I was actually a girl and I got annoyed it wasn't a guy. So I turned my phone off and told myself I will flip a coin to see if I was gay (I knew at this point but was just making sure I was happy with my answer) when it landed on heads to say I am not gay, I flipped it over to tails myself and went to bed. Today I am writing this, I just wanted to say to someone that I am so gay, not entirley sure how I feek about it but I am gettibg there with accepting it, also just wanted to say hello.

13,"IWTL how to get over my best friend


hey guys, this is my first post here, so i apologize if i’m doing anything wrong.  it’s going to likely be long as fuck, but i don’t know how to abridge it without losing any of the important stuff. feels like i’d be doing it a disservice, y’know?

my best friend and i (21 and 22 years old respectively) have known each other since we were 11 and have been best friends pretty much just as long. when i was 13 and started figuring out the whole gay thing, he was the first guy i had feelings for. we rode the same bus route for the entirety of middle school, hung other together on the weekends and afternoons, stayed up all night playing video games, had our shitty inside jokes, spent summers swimming in either his or my pool- we did everything together.

for the next year or so i just kept it to myself and tried my hardest not to let it get to me, but i think our “friends” knew at the time that i wasn’t straight, and they’d tease us all the time about stuff that we were all too young to really truly understand. suffice to say it bothered both of us- i felt like i was being made fun of for something that hit a little too close to home, even if they didn’t know it. when we were alone we’d joke as if we were together, even though in reality we were both kids with little to no idea about how that sort of thing worked. and that continued to be the norm throughout our eighth grade year to the summer before our junior year of high school.

i should probably note that this is where things started to go to shit- i had been struggling with this for the better part of three years now, and it was really starting to get to me. by this point i had resigned myself to the fact that i was honest-to-God in love with him, even though we were only, what, fifteen? i had no clue if he felt the same way, or if he was even the slightest bit gay, and it wore on me until i finally got up the guts to tell him over text while i was out of state with my family. it didn’t go well at all, he got mad and told me that he had a date with a girl the next day and threw the stereotypical “what will your parents think” “how do you know you’re gay if you’ve never dated a girl” and even went as far as to tell me that he “chose” to be straight. i was beyond fucked up, called the only friend at the time that knew (her and i are still really close, but that’s irrelevant) and cried myself to sleep.

he and i went to different high schools, so it was a little less than a year before either of us really talked to one another. we didn’t have to, so it was easier if we didn’t at all, you know? eventually we slowly eased our way back into being friends, we both apologized, it was a little awkward, et cetera. over time we started hanging out more and more again, but it wasn’t ever the same and never went anywhere past best friend territory. he’d gotten a girlfriend, the same girl he’d gone on that date with, and they were steady for the rest of high school. flash forward to freshman year of college, different universities, he’s broken up with his girlfriend and halfway across the state from me, i’m a mess of a human being (severely depressed, failing all my classes, not a single fucking clue why i’m still alive), and we really only see each other over breaks. that summer we get drunk with another friend at my place while my parents are out of town and he tells us that he’d never admit that he’s bi because he hates the idea of other people treating him differently for it. this is earth shattering to me, and suddenly the crush i thought i’d finally gotten over comes back to sucker punch me in the face. we didn’t really talk about it because i knew it made him uncomfortable, and so nothing happens.

during that school year he gets wasted and tells me over text that he wants to do stuff with me but probably never would because i “can’t ignore feelings.” and then winter break hits. the night before new years eve, we get absolutely hammered. i bring it up, he says we can’t because he knows how i feel and doesn’t think it will end well. we turn of the lights, he’s sleeping on the floor and i’m in his bed. i hear him get up, he says something about regretting it in the morning and kisses me. we end up sleeping together. not full-on sex, but he sucks my dick, i suck his, that’s that. we haven’t done anything since, but we’ve talked about it. 

that was a year ago, he’s insistent he doesn’t have feelings for me, tells me it it’s hurting me and that i need to get over him, tells me he loves me but not the way i need him to. turns out he’s still in love with his ex from all the way back in high school, and he’s having as hard of a time with it as i am.  i can’t help but pray he’d feel the same way about me as he does her, and we’ve told each other that i’ll get over him if he gets over her. it feels impossible. i know i’m only making things worse for myself and for him, but we’re best friends. we’ve been best friends for half of our lives. i know this sort of thing pretty much always ends up being a shitshow, and i don’t know what to do. i keep imagining that it’s going to end up like a taylor swift song and that he’s going to realize he feels the same way, but i’m setting myself up for nothing but even more heartbreak. i know this was lengthy and a bit convoluted, there’s a fair bit i’m leaving out but this is really the first time i’ve typed this all out and it’s late and i just really need some advice right now. anything helps. 

i wish we could get our happily ever after, but i’d settle for anything, i just can’t lose him. he means too much to me.

-love, cj"
