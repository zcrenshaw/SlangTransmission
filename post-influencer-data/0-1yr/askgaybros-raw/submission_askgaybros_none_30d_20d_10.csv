I hate this religion that I’m forced into. Had to go to Eid prayers today, the imam was on about how being gay is an abomination, and that the biggest attack on Islam in the UK are Lgbt  related lessons in schools. Instead of imams and mullahs raping little boys.                             They kicked me out of the mosque because I dared to challenge their barbaric beliefs and no one stood with me not even the cowards in the crowd who are gay.plus gays who still follow Islam your all delusional and you can go die for all I care."

Said no one in real life ever."
2,"Reddit just outed me


I was hanging out with my friends and I let one of them use my phone for a little to call someone. At that right moment the r/gaybrosgonemild trending notification pops up and he had to say it out loud ""Dude why are you subscribing a gay sub are you gay"". Then of course it turned out awkward as I had nothing to respond. It was a group of guys who I assume were all straight. I left early cause I couldn't bear the awkwardness. God I hate myself and my phone. How am I supposed to go to school after this."
3,"After our son came out my wife and I are cut off from the community here totally


I am not regretting. If I had to make a choice between my son and other people I would pick him any time. 
My wife and I used to be very social people and after our son came out we are automatically uninvited to all parties and family gatherings. I haven't spoken to my parents in 2 months. They pretend we don't exist. 

My wife feels especially ostracised since she was practically fired from a place she basically started.  She is very depressed. Our son is going to leave to study abroad in September. I hope he finds happiness and acceptance."
4,"Joked with my dad about being gay for the first time


I have one of those relationships with my dad where he knows I’m gay, he’s not pretty much fine with it (he was incredibly incredulous and only ever asked me if I was sure because I’d never been with a girl when I came out), we never ever talk about it but he hasn’t rejected me or treated me badly because I’m gay. We just never discuss my romantic life or gay issues or anything related to homosexuality.

But today I took him to a shoe outlet to get some new...shoes and he got some suede shoes with a [small heel](https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0419/1525/products/1024x1024-Men-Scout-Midnight-LB1_6102ba48-fb66-4207-8422-f3036feac1a9_1024x1024.jpg?v=1556983630) and as we were leaving he said “Who doesn’t like a heel?” and I said in response “And I’m the gay one...” and he let out a real belly laugh.

It wasn’t a big deal but it was a nice little moment between me and my dad where my being gay wasn’t this sword of Damocles hanging over my head for onve."

8,"update: My brother (16) came out to me earlier, what should I (20M) be doing to help him right now


so firstly I just wanted to seriously thank every body who replied to [my first post](https://old.reddit.com/r/askgaybros/comments/cj55dk/my_brother_16_came_out_to_me_earlier_what_should/). and also everybody who read through the comments to make sure that a point that they thought should be made, was made. the advice was helpful, really. ive read every comment multiple times over the past three weeks.

i watched love, simon with my brother like a couple people recommended. he had seen it already but didnt mind seeing it again. the scene where his mom was telling him he can exhale now, man that was good. we talked about that scene afterward, because i hope my brother feels that, even if its just around me right now. 

couple days after that i asked him if he had a 'type'. he said he maybe he did, but admitted that talking about guys with me felt weird. i told him that was ok, and that it won't always feel weird. couple days ago we were watching tv and segment came on about cameron boyce. my brother said ""he was really cute"", i said 'yeah? the freckles?', and he said ""yeah, freckles are pretty cool"". then he said that alex standall was also cute, and then he went to the kitchen. and that was that, so it's a good start, i think. 

our parents are away this weekend, and so he is planning on telling our other brother (who i named Nick lol) on saturday. i asked him if there's anything i could do to help and offered to be there when he tells Nick. he asked if I could be home when he tells him, but maybe not necessarily in the room, he isnt sure yet. 

a couple people mentioned that it was important not to promise things outside of my control. so i told him that i think Nick is going to be fine, and that Nick has said positive things about gay rights before, but not that i promise he'll be fine with it (even though i think he will be). i have however promised that no matter what happens, how anyone in our family or outside of it takes it, that i will have his back and that i will accept him.

i've also tried to stress to him that he can talk to me about anything. i havent talked to about grinder yet, someone mentioned i should remind him that he is underage and its not safe, so i will do that.

but really i just want to say thank you. seeing him upset like that when he came out really worried me, so im so thankful for all the advice."
9,"PSA: Be honest about your HIV status BEFORE you hooking up with someone.


I’m a long time lurker of this subreddit and I just wanted to tell you guys about a little situation I encountered. 

The other day I received a message from this really cute guy on Grindr. We had great chemistry, exchanged pics, and basically decided to hook up. I asked about his status and he tells me “I’m negative, I just got tested a couple weeks ago.” Ok great, I’m still thinking to myself that I’m going to use a condom to be on the safe side anyway. He gets to my place and we start doing the deed. He’s a bottom so eventually he asks me “Can we do it without a condom? I hate the feeling of it.” I politely explain to him that I’m not comfortable with that and he says “Well I’m POZ but undetectable so it’ll be fine.” At this point I’m rather upset because he flat out lied to me before coming. He literally waited until I was knee-deep inside of him to tell the truth. God forbid if the condom was defective or broken. I asked him why he would do that and he says “Well, I figured if I told you, you wouldn’t agree to meet me.” Are you kidding me?

First of all, if I say I want to use a condom, you’re going to need to be ok with that. If you can’t respect that, it’s no deal for me. Secondly, lying about your HIV status just to hook up is really sickening and part of the reason this disease is spreading so rapidly. It’s actually considered assault in some cases if you knowingly infect someone else. You have no idea how compromised someone else’s immune system is. Just because you are “undetectable” does not mean you are immune to spreading the virus. Please, be responsible about having sex. Do not trick people for the sake of a quick fuck. Know your status and be truthful about it."
10,"Kind of surprised romantic/softcore gay porn isn't big in the community...


Only some amateur gay porn has some softcore/romantic elements to it and studio produced gay porn is really... aggressive which is understandable it's porn it's always been like that. However, I have always thought that softcore would be a sub category that's popular. It's not even being produced is it really that unprofitable?
No offense but alot of gay men are extremely lonely and long for emotional connection and I have always thought that softcore would be an extremely profitable porn category to exploit that loneliness. 
I think I am going to become a porn director and make this happen."
11,"To all the young or ""lost"" guys out there; NEVER shy away from reaching out for help


This is all I want to tell you guys. If you are troubled by something, feeling alone, feeling depressed, don't do anything rash. Take a breath and remember that life is long and whatever you are missing right now, you can have it or even better in the future. I have been a pain in the ass for many people here. And many of them dislike or even hate me. But there are those who didn't stop reaching out. Even when I was acting my worst they kept pushing kindness forward. We all have to accept we have our own lives that move in different dynamics and comparing yourself to others can only make you bitter. Be happy for them and fight for what you want to achieve. Will it be perfect? Of course not. But what is ? 


I want to do the same that so many guys here have done for me for somebody so if you are reading this and you are in any kind of pain or just have no one to talk to, message me. I will be your friend, or just a shoulder to cry your troubles on. I'm here."
12,"I discovered my boyfriend has issues with his penis size and I don’t know how to support him


I (29) lived with my boyfriend (32) for almost two years, recently he moved abroad (long story) and we are doing long distance for about six months.

First thing was a hard drive he left behind, a couple months ago I decided to check if there was anything important in it and realized there was a folder with a video where they’d measure penis sizes of several guys. I mean, who hasn’t seen one of those growing up, but I got slightly worried he had that as a go to when he had anxieties about it..

Today I was moving some furniture and had to move some of his things he left out of it to be able to lift it.. I found a penis pump, which kinda confirmed my worries that this is something that bothers him a lot.

He is smaller than average but nothing dramatic, it was never a problem to me, to be fair I don’t even like very big guys. He is cut and he mentioned before he wishes he wasn’t.

I’m the bottom nearly all the time, I always enjoy when he tops me but now I realize that most of the time he prefers just to finger me, and many times he gets very nervous when he tries to top and ends up just using his hands..

It crushes my heart to think this is something that worries him for this long.

I love him very much and I don’t want him to feel bad about himself.

Being this far is very difficult. I don’t know yet if we can make the relationship work, or when I’ll be able to move, so I even worry if this is something he will have problems with other guys. I really want him to be happy.

Any ideas of what can I do?

Thanks"

15,"PSA : American insurance companies will more than likely cover a full STI workup if you say ""I got a text from a friends with benefits saying he has XYZ""

It was fully covered. Luckily I was clean. Now my insurance company must think I fuck lots of dirty men. But idgaf, they pay for it every 6 months."

18,"I just had my first sexual encounter and it felt amazing.


I decided the other night to hop on Grindr, see who's around, etc. A guy messaged me (I'd rather not say his real name, so let's call him Carl) we chatted it up a bit, we're into the same stuff, anime, games. We trade nudes, he likes what he sees and so do I. He eventually asks when he can come over (since he lives not even an hour away from me, I got real lucky, hardly anyone gay lives nearby)

so he came over today, we watched Spider-Verse, lied in bed a bit, then he asked if we could try this ""strip-gaming"" thing he mentioned while messaging me. One piece of clothing came off after every round of Mario Kart. I won that contest cause I'm just too damn good I guess.

I proceeded to get all the way naked, and we lied back in bed, spooning, hugging, legs between each others, it was a real good time. Also did some ""rubbing of each other's snakes"" if you know what I mean.

Eventually he asked me what I wanted to do. I said ""anal and maybe kissing?"" I'm a bottom, and he's a bottom so anal was pretty much a no-go. So we just sucked each other off. My first gay kiss and first blowjob (I lived in a christian home as a kid, had christian family, etc) so being able to finally do all this was a weight off my shoulders.

We then lied back in bed, touched ourselves a bit more, then just jerked til we came.

I know this isn't a ""mindblowing"" experience, but it was my first time I gotta gush!

TLDR: Meet up with a guy from Grindr, I then proceed to have my first sexual experience with a guy, it was a great time."
19,"I'm being gaslighted. Don't ever let someone make you question your sanity or sense of reality.


I got home two nights ago from a four-day trip to visit my family. Yesterday while my boyfriend was at work, I was throwing some stuff out when I noticed a condom wrapper in the trash, along with a used condom.

Furious, I texted him and said ""Why the fuck is there a used condom in the trash? I hope it's not what it appears to be. I was really excited to see you.""

He texts back saying he used the condom to play with the dildo. Then said he was really unhappy and hurt that I jumped to conclusions and accused him of cheating. 

Still curious, I emptied the trash into another bag and I found two other condoms. All of them were used, and had cum inside. 

All three were separate brands too. 

I felt disgusted. 

I confronted him about it when I got home. He said he jerks off into them and also uses them for the dildo.

Okay, this is plausible. I mean, I do this too with the dildo for sanitary reasons, and it's better than cumming in a tissue. 

But still, just something felt off. 

I told him that I trust him - and I *especially* trust him because he knows that cheating on me, whether it was protected or not, could have health consequences - and I know he wouldn't risk exposing me to STD's. 

If he was guilty, I thought that statement regarding my health would get him to confess. But he didn't so I guess he's innocent.

That conversation ended with him telling me he's incredibly hurt that I was accusing him (I feel like every time I raise a valid concern he gets defensive).

Later in the evening, he was showing me some pictures on his phone. I noticed what appeared to be a screenshot of a Grindr profile. 

I was going to ignore it, but decided it probably wasn't a good idea. So I said, ""Hey, I just saw a screenshot of a Grindr profile. Can you please show me that?""

He paused and was like ""What are you talking about?"" 

I told him again what I saw, and asked him to show me. He told me there was nothing, so I told him to show me the pictures.

The screenshot was located between an actual picture and a meme. 

He opened the photos app, and I saw the screenshot briefly before he tapped on the meme picture. 

He said ""This is what you saw. It kinda looks like Grindr from a distance.""

I told him that certainly is not what I saw. I asked him to swipe to the picture before that. 

And he wouldn't. After asking several times, he got mad and said that I'm accusing him again and he won't tolerate this from me. 

I told him I'm completely sober and I know what I saw. I asked if he thinks I'm delusional or something. 

He told me he doesn't like that I question so many things on his phone and who he talks to - he feels I have too much ""control"". Seriously? He goes out of his way to hide his screen from me sometimes and acts in the most suspicious and secretive ways.

I would let him go through my phone - except for my private notes. I have nothing to hide. So why is it such a big deal with him?

After this exchange, I began to walk away, but he said to come back in the room. I told him I wasn't happy and asked once more to see the screenshot.

This time he showed all the pictures - and guess what? The screenshot was gone. In the minute between me turning around to walk out and coming back, he deleted it.

I called him out on deleting it and this led to him getting even more furious for not believing him.

I felt like a fucking god damn fool. I knew exactly what he was doing - gaslighting in its purest form. He was making me question my sanity, my reality, all the while berating me for accusing him of stuff. 

I observed my mind as it played mental gymnastics to try and restructure my memory of the screenshot. 

How long has he been distorting my sense of reality? If he's lying in my face about this, what about the condoms? What about all these other things - whether big or small? 

Is he a narcissist? Sociopath? 

I played along last night because I was tired and just wanted to go to sleep. He was drunk per usual (he drinks often on the weekends) so there was no point in trying to continue the conversation.

I did put my forehead to his, told him to look in my eyes, and then I told him he's beautiful and I love him. He then started crying, kinda like a guilty cry.

Oh, and I also noticed Grindr, Tinder, and Bumble on his phone. Like what the fuck? I didn't dare mention this because I couldn't even get him to show the screenshot.

I feel really disgusted right now. I know that if I stand up for myself and tell him I know he's lying to me, he will just get mad and blame me for everything. He will threaten to break up because I'm the abusive one.

No, you know why he threatens to break up? Because I figured out his game. And if he can't play me, he has to move on to the next victim. 

Anyways. This is honestly really scary. When it's at the point someone is making you question your sense of reality - I think that's a sign to GTFO."
