0,"Unpopular Opinion: Straight Women at Gay Bars


I’m probably gonna get mega downvotes for this but I miss the days where gay bars were a place to go meet gay men and see other gay men. Recently I’ve noticed an influx of women going to gay bars and to be honest they’re annoying and disrespectful. 

I appreciate and am happy about the mainstream acceptance of gay culture but an odd side effect of this is a gaggle of women coming to drag shows and gay bars saying things like “yaaaas qweeeeen” and “hennnnny.”

Bear bars and bathhouses seem to be the only place exclusively gay anymore. "
1,"Thank you to all the older Gay men.


We the younger gays probably do not say this enough but here you go. Thank you from the bottom of my heart for being brave and proud and paving a way us the younger gays to be able to live in our truth openly. Thank you for choosing to speak up in the midst of hate and discrimination.  Y'all are the real HEROS. X"
2,"Shout out to the guy on Grindr who has been saying “Hey” to me for the last 5 years.


Your determination is admirable."
3,"My straight buddy that has never had a girlfriend his entire life doesn’t wanna hang out anymore cause I’m a ‘fag’


This is seriously the funniest shit. This dude is 23 years old, never had a relationship, never kissed anybody, never even held a girl’s hand. 

We hangout at our house playing video games all the time and he has spent his birthday 3 years in a role hanging out with me. We go see movies all the time with another buddy of his.

Just to be clear, I AM NOT ATTRACTED TO THIS NERD WHATSOEVER, don’t get your ‘stop fantasizing straight guys’ spray on. We play video games together, that’s it. There was never anything remotely close to sexual that has ever happened.

I asked him tonight yo do you wanna come play anthem at my house this game is a lot of fun and he says ‘how lonely are you to wanna play video games with another dude?’

Then proceed to call me a fag (I’ve been openly gay since highschool and it’s nothing new to him) and told me he’s been playing heroes of the storm (lmfao) with this chick and he doesn’t wanna play with me anymore.

Well, FUCK YOU TOO, sir, I don’t give a shit about you anyway so I guess that’s that.
"
4,"Why did I fall in love with this jerk?




Throwaway because I have not told my family yet.

I got back my results. I have cancer. We are still early. But surgery and chemotherapy are required.

I was crying a lot when I called my boyfriend. I felt horrible. And he just said OK. I did not notice that at first.

When I got home, he was almost leaving. He had his luggage. I asked what are you doing? And he said sorry, I am not going to get involved in drama.

And he left!

The jerk left! I can not believe the jerk left! I am so devastated, and the doctor told me to not be sad! I love him so much, and he turned out to be a jerk!

Sorry for my English."
5,"How I wish I could be young again


I am already in my late 60s. When I was young being gay in my country was illegal. People were getting to camps for being gay. Things have changed over time and nowadays it is legal. There are no options like marriage and adoption and the majority of people are homophobic but it's got better. And I see more and more younger kids being open about themselves. And I wish I could be them. I wish I could be young again. I wish I could fall inlove for the first time, I wish I could live in a world where I could be myself. It's too late for that. The years have passed and my life is at it's end. A wasted life if you ask me. I am happy that the young boys now might have more of a chance than I ever did. But I am also full of sadness and regret. That I never got to experience being the real me. "
6,"I just caught my husband blowing my brother.


My brother moved in with us back in October as he recently graduated college and moved to the city I live in for better job opportunities. I work a 2nd job on the weekends early in mornings. Yesterday afternoon we went out for a bite to eat and a couple beers. We got home and the drinking continued. I didn't drink too much because I had to get up at 4AM to go to work. I was in bed by 930. Whe. I left for work, they were still up chatting and listening to music. When I got home around 230 today, they were both passed out on the couch. I didn't want to disturb them so I headed upstairs. I'd been up here for about an hour. I was kinda bored and feeling a little frisky so I started watching porn with the volume on my phone as low as it could go. All of a sudden I hear moaning from downstairs. My first reaction was, ""fuck i left my bluetooth on."" I quickly paused what was playing but the sounds didn't stop. I hear moans and slurping, a small caught here in there. I slowly crawled on all 4's to the stairs in an attempt to not make the floor boards creak. I got to stairs and just played there and listened until it was over. It's been about an hour and a half now and the house is silent. I assume they fell asleep again. I haven't gone downstairs yet. 

I don't know how to feel. We've both made mistakes. We went on a cruise back in November and I drunkenly traded blow jobs with a guy on the ship. I never told him this happened.. Honestly, I'm not very mad that he blew another guy. I just dont know how to feel that that guy was my brother. And that guy lives with us. Was this the first time? How long has this been going on? Do I need to ask him to move out? Are we okay with casual hookups now? Are we just not satisfied with each other and we need to split? Jesus. What the fuck is my life, even?"
7,"A straight guy I worked with just told me he was “pre-cumming” when we were talking once and he didn’t know why


Since I started there, I had a thing for him- he’s just a sweet guy that’s hot af. But he always talked about his girlfriend.... until they broke up. I haven’t worked with the company for 3 months now and tonight, he hit me up to grab drinks later this week. 
Then he came at me with another question:
“Are you a top or a bottom?”
My chest felt like exploding!!!!!  My dream come true!!!!!
We continue the conversation and he starts saying stuff like:
 “I never been with a guy before but there's been times where I've thought about things. Like that time we was working on the basement &amp; we were talking.. I'm not gonna lie, I was feeling a type of way while we was talkin”
“Lol this is crazy , I never thought I was gonna tell you. I was pre-cumming while you was talking to me &amp; like I said I never been with a guy before so I was like ""what the fuck"" “
“Don't get me wrong I love Pussy. But like I said I was pre-cumming wen we were talking so there must be something else I needa figure out “
“The vibe I was feeling from you was just something organic”.

I’m genuinely impressed at how collected he seems to be exploring his newfound sexuality so freely. 
I’m beyond excited for the drinks we’re grabbing on Friday. He asked me if I’d be upset if he leaned in after we got back to my place then (verbatim) said “kinda picturing us trading each other’s throat” and SOMETHING about that sentence just got me fucking going.

Sorry if I don’t really have an ask. I’m just gushing over this and don’t know where else to let it out!! 

Hot straight work friends aren’t just a pipe dream!!!!!  "
8,"Had an orgasm from bottoming for the first time..


Well I thought I was your average 24 year old guy into women up until last night... 

I recently kinda drifted into gay porn and found myself being pretty curious about giving it a try. s I figured what the heck and matched up with a guy from tinder. I straight up told him I had never done anything with a guy but I wanted to try it all out and he was nice about it. 

That night I went over his place and was really nervous as we sat and talked. Eventually I went down on him and I was instantly really turned on from giving him head. I hadn't been that hard in a long while. 

Eventually the main event was when I was bottoming. After getting over the initial pain of penetration it started to feel pretty darn good. As I was laying on my back on the edge of the bed, he was standing and holding my legs up. I felt like I needed to pee but then realized I was going to cum and I did with out touching myself. It was the most intense orgasm of my life. 

From what I have read today its from the prostate. I am curious to know if this will be a regular thing as I need more of it haha. "
9,"Homophobia vs. heterosexism


So I've been out since I was 15. Parents have always been really cool about it. Mom and Dad both voted against the gay marriage ban when it was on the ballot in my state, etc. My parents are definitely not homophobic.

But I've begun to realize that they may be something almost as bad -- ***heterosexist***. My parents always prioritized my sister's boyfriend -- actively inviting him to Thanksgiving, including him on trips, pushing the two of them to move in together, pushing my sister to drop hints so he'll propose, etc. When I started dating my boyfriend in 2017, it was crickets. 

* Mom still refers to him as my ""friend"" when talking to other family members -- even family members that are accepting of me, like my sister.
* They've never invited him along on any family events (though I doubt they would object if I asked). 
* When I spend time at my boyfriend's (three nights per week), my mom asks me why I'm spending so much time there and tells me I need to focus on work and visit *them* more often (my sister says mom has never told *her* this). 
* When I go to my parents for advice for relationship issues, my mom has told me ""Maybe you'd feel less stressed out if you were single.""
* And they simply assume I'm never going to have a wedding because I'm gay. I asked my mom and she basically said what's the point of a wedding if there's no bridal gown...just get married at the courthouse.

This has all put a ton of strain on my relationship with my boyfriend... He sees pictures from family events with my sister's boyfriend included and asks why he wasn't invited. (I don't exactly feel comfortable bringing him to extended family's houses uninvited.)  We've come a long way with acceptance and homophobia, but I still feel like in many people's eyes, our relationships are still second class.

Anyone else deal with this or notice it?"
10,"Mom is being a cunt ever since I’ve come out


Not a question - just need to rant.

Everything that comes out of my Mom’s mouth is subtly homophobic. Every time I go out to hang with friends, she’ll ask if I left the house to do “bad stuff.” I ask her what she means by that and she’s all “I dunno, what do you think I mean?”

If I call her out, she’ll play the victim card and say I’m “attacking her” and that she should just stop caring about me.

On Valentines Day, I went out with my boyfriend to go see Battle Angel Alita. The day after, I catch the flu and am puking all over the place. My Mom has the fucking nerve to ask “Well, what did you do yesterday to get sick?” in such a condescending tone. It pisses me off because I had already told her I was going out to see a movie.

Here I am, lying miserable and livid in my bed. "
11,"Straight guy: I don't have a problem with you being gay or anything I just don't want you hitting on me. Gay guy: Dude you're not even attractive. Straight guy: Excuse me whaaaa?


This is really how it be. "
12,"Does anyone else find woman really distant and cold towards them before you reveal that you are gay.


It happens all the time. I’ll be talking to a coworker or maybe just a mutual friend and be turned off by just how distant, aloof and cold they are towards me for no apparent reason. Then, as soon as I hint that I’m gay or mention my bf, they suddenly open up and start treating me like a human being. Does anyone else find this incredibly annoying? "
13,"Update: I just caught my husband blowing my brother.


[Original Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/askgaybros/comments/arqm16/i_just_caught_my_husband_blowing_my_brother/)

&amp;#x200B;

I couldn't do this last night because I was just so emotionally and physically exhausted. 

&amp;#x200B;

Thank you everyone for the responses to my previous post. While some of you are assholes, a lot of you gave some really good advice and points that gave me a lot to think about and the courage to confront my husband and really search myself.

&amp;#x200B;

I spent most of my work day just thinking about everything. About our relationship, what I liked about it, what I disliked about it, where I saw our future vs what I'd like my future to be. I felt physically ill all day. I just wanted to puke. I came to the conclusion that I just needed to be true to myself. I haven't been happy for a LONG time. I knew that whatever the results were of the confrontation about the blowjob that I needed to end it. I was barely holding it together after I came to this decision. I needed to leave. I asked my manager if I could speak with her in private so we headed to an empty conference room. As soon as the door shut I just couldn't hold back anymore and burst into tears. I told her I had some crazy stuff going on at home and I'd like to leave as I was having a hard time focusing. She was extremely understanding and told me that I was definitely able to take tomorrow off as well (I did). She asked if I'd like her to call me a cab. I declined. She left the room and I pulled myself together enough to walk through the office at least somewhat composed. I immediately called my friend (who knew about the situation) and asked if I could meet her somewhere. She was at Target so I met her there and we just sat in my car and talked for a good hour. 

&amp;#x200B;

When I got home, I asked my husband if we could talk in the bedroom. He had also gone home early because he didn't feel well from the drinking the night/day before. We sat on the bed and I said, ""I need you to tell me what happened between you and \[brother\] yesterday afternoon."" He paused for a bit and then said, ""I don't know what you're talking about, I don't remember anything from that night."" I couldn't believe he was denying it! I explained in detail exactly what I had heard. Again he says he doesn't remember and that he would never do that to me, to us. I told him how convenient it is that whenever he drinks and something bad happens (like us getting into an argument or him acting like an ass hat) he never remembers it the next day. He just kept stonewalling. We just sat there in silence for a good two minutes or so. I finally said, ""Regardless, this situation has made me think a lot. I've realized I need to grow a backbone and tell you that I'm unhappy, that I don't want to do this anymore. I'm tired of being in a relationship just because I'm scared to leave, scared to hurt our friends and family, scared to hurt you. I'm tired of trying to so hard to be happy."" I explained that I love and care about him but I haven't been in love with him for a long time. He said he needed a minute and left the room. I grabbed my backpack and started putting an overnight bag together. He came back and asked what I was doing. I told him I'd booked a hotel. We sat down on the bed again and he said, ""I didn't think I'd ever say this but it sounds like you want a divorce."" Honestly, I'm crying pretty profusely at this point. I just replied, ""I do."" (Interesting how a marriage can begin and end with same words.)

&amp;#x200B;

I went to my hotel and called my mom. We talked for well over an hour. No, I didn't tell her about the situation with my brother. She wasn't surprised. We'd had this same talk at least 3 times over the past couple of years after drunken fights with my husband that he supposedly didn't remember. This time though, we had had a real, sit down, sober talk. She said everything a mother should and she made me feel more calm. We talked about her own experience with divorce (her and my father are no longer together). After I got off the phone with my mom, took a long, hot bath.

&amp;#x200B;

I started texting a childhood friend of mine who I'm meeting this Thursday in Minneapolis. Her and her girlfriend recently broke up and she asked if I'd go with her to a concert and basketball game in Milwaukee this weekend since she already has tickets. It'll be good to get away for a long weekend. 

&amp;#x200B;

I realized I hadn't eaten since the half of a waffle I had Sunday morning so I went to a diner and ate then went back to the hotel and went to bed and now here we are.

&amp;#x200B;

I've never gone through a break up before, let alone a divorce. This whole process seems so daunting. What are my next steps? Do I immediately find a lawyer? My mom said that it may be less expensive to figure out and agree how we are going to divide everything before contacting a lawyer. I guess that's how my parents did it. Do we sleep separately now? Do we stop saying ""I love you"" and calling each other ""babe?""  These are going to be hard habits to get out of especially when we are still living together.

&amp;#x200B;

I know a lot of you are going to ask if I've confronted my brother. No, I haven't. Maybe I will today when I get home. I don't know. What's the point anymore if we're getting divorced anyway? Maybe he'll bring it up out of guilt. Am I even mad about the whole blowjob thing? I still don't now. Maybe my brain is just fucked up.

&amp;#x200B;

Anyway, this may have not have been as juicy as some of you had hoped but it's the boring truth. Maybe I'll update more, maybe not. "
14,"Loss of a sub member


Dear Friends - a sweet guy (one of your bros) who was active on the exmormon sub, was lost in a pedestrian traffic accident. He'd had two usernames (had accidentally deleted his original account) and we first met him as ""MormonDiscard"" on our sub. 

His current name was ""WaitImthinkin"" (here's a link to his account): https://www.reddit.com/user/WaitImThinkin

Here's a link to the post in the exmo sub that informs us of his loss:

https://www.reddit.com/r/exmormon/comments/ar4g2g/update_on_the_gay_exmo_whose_life_was_saved_by/

We are devastated, and I thought you all might want to know as well (so I joined your sub &amp; posted the sad information here). One of our sub members maintained a sweet friendship with this young man after his post last fall (the one under his MormonDiscard name). I feel that person, as well as all of you here who were open and candid about life as a gay bro, helped him have a few months of peace at the end of his  short life. I felt he was a talented writer, and I encouraged him to pursue that. 

BTW - I am not a bro (I hope it's okay to crash the sub for a bit to share the information above). But I am a Mama Dragon (parent of an LGBTQ). My heart is breaking at the loss of this young man. 

One last thought (hope this doesn't offend anyone here): The Mormon church is toxic to gays. I had NO IDEA when I joined of the level of their prejudice and hatred. Please, if you know anyone who is gay and is also in that church, encourage them to research the cult's history. Encourage them to visit and/or join our exmo sub. We support and protect our sub members who have been harmed by the church's ""aversion therapy"" practices or their just plain abuses of gays. 

Thanks for letting me post here. I'm off now, to cry some more... "
15,"Walking past my boyfriend of five years while he was getting dressed in the bathroom.... and stopped....


He looked at me and started to get a chub even though I think I wasn’t looking my best. Still got it!  He’s amazing also and I love him so so much. I’m alone rn and just had no one else to tell. "
16,"My son is better but my wife is worse


Since my son came out it's been really challenging. I have completely supported him but as I previously said here, my wife is not as accepting. Since her friends stopped calling her because she has a gay son she has grown even more sad and angry. She quit her job and she just stays home all day. She gets drunk every evening, takes alchohol and sleeping pills together, it's really bad. I tried getting her to somekind of therapist but she refuses. Tried talking to her and she said all of her dreams have been crushed and she doesn't want to live anymore. She dreamed of having grandkids and our son having a nice family and not for him to bring home a ""son-in-law"" . The situation is very bad and she is very depressed. And to add to that he told his grandparents and they all freaked out. Her father said he doesn't have a daughter or a grandson anymore. Things are so crazy."
17,"Compliments from other guys


Does anyone else get a big dumb smile on their face after a guy compliments you. Cute guy at Starbuck passingly said ""I like your sweater"" and I've been sitting here beaming like an idiot for the last 5 minutes."
