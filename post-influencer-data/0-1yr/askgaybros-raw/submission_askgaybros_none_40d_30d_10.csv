0,"My brother decided not to have me in his wedding party because his other groomsmen feel uncomfortable around me


I'm my brother's only brother and I was supposed to be his best man. He also asked 3 other friends and his fiancee's brother to be his groomsmen. The 4 of them are uncomfortable around me because I'm gay, so my brother said I should attend the wedding as a guest instead.

I've never done anything to these guys. I never looked at them funny, I never flirted with them, I never made any weird comments. I have a boyfriend, I'm not interested in other guys, especially not straight guys, and especially not my sister in law's brother.

I'm more hurt by this than I'd care to admit. I've been feeling sick to my stomach for days and I can't even talk to my brother for longer than a minute because I've started to resent him so much I can't stand looking in his face.

I probably won't even go to the wedding. And I'm not sure if I'll be able to continue my relationship with my brother. I don't know what to do."
1,"If you‚Äôre underage, get the fuck off Grindr


I‚Äôve been reporting the same 16 year old daily for about a week now because he keeps making new accounts once his old one is taken down.

If you‚Äôre underage you‚Äôre not only putting yourself at risk but you‚Äôre putting other innocent people at risk too. Be patient and wait until you‚Äôre 18."
2,"Iraq's only LGBT organization published a document showing the true scale of LGBT people's suffering in the country. Gaybros, let's please spread awareness about this.


This is truly heartbreaking.  [This](https://www.iraqueer.org/uploads/1/2/4/0/124034920/living_on_the_margins.pdf) document contains truly horrifying stories from LGBT folks in Iraq. Countless people were killed, tortured and/or had to leave the country in search of a better life. Iraq has one of the most invisible LGBT communities in the world so please make this go viral so we could spread the word on reddit!"
3,"Cute (and dedicated) customer finally crossed paths with me!


A customer at work had come in on two separate occasions when I wasn't there, and both times bumped into the same girl filling in for me.

He asked her what days I work, saying that he keeps coming in hoping ""the cute teller"" will notice him but I never do (whoops).

Anyway I finally crossed paths with him last week and I told him I had heard plenty about him from fellow staff and even my manager was loving it!

And I just straight up had to ask how did he know I was gay, he would've only seen me for a combined total of under two minutes.

He said my hand gestures were a giveaway and bit of my vibe as well, and I was just left so impressed.

So after that I grabbed his number and decided to get to know him a little better, now we're talking every day and I'm excited to see where things may go üëÄ

Just wanted to share a little feel-good story!"
4,"The cashier at Whole Foods messaged me on Grindr after I left and wants to grab coffee! I‚Äôm blushing so hard right now. [20m]


I‚Äôm like 19 days sober and I lost so much weight from not using that he really made me feel so good about myself‚ò∫Ô∏è"
5,"Straight guy here, but I really wanna fuck a dudes ass


Said no actually straight guy ever ü§™"
6,"That euphoric moment when you find out a guy you like is also gay/bi, but then you‚Äôre crushed when it turns out he‚Äôs not into you.


And you work harder to try to get to know him, but it‚Äôs ultimately one sided and you feel like you wasted so much time.  Like I was happy to actually know I had a chance, but now I keep questioning what‚Äôs wrong with me :("
7,"My dad doesn't really get along with my husband


I feel kinda sad. My father had a really hard time accepting I was gay. It took years of very awkward moments. And now that I am married things are awkward again. 


I got married 5 years ago and we have a wonderful son together who is now 3. We used a surrogate and our boy  is biologically my husband's son. 

My dad has always been very affectionate with my sister's husband and my brother's wife but he barely sheds a word with my husband. When my husband says something that's like a statement for example ""oh the weather is so bad today"" my dad just sits silent or says something like ""uhm"". I thought he was just getting used to it at first but this has been going on for 5 years. And he doesn't seem pretty affectionate with our son either. I was wondering why until I overheard a conversation between him and my mother. Apparently she noticed it too and she was asking  him why he was so affectionate with his other grandchildren and not with my son. And he said ""this kid is not my grandchild, it's that man's kid, it has nothing to do with me, it's not my blood and it never will be my grandchild. You know full well I pretend like that for years because I don't want to lose Jason(me)."" These words stung me so hard right in my heart. I am very hurt by what he said and I am most hurt that he really means it and he was just putting a facade to have a relationship with me."
8,"I had a guy come out to me yesterday during a job interview and it was his first time he had told anybody


He was so nervous! His voice was trembling, he was trying to act so brave! It was adorable tbh. I didn't really know what to do. This was the first time I had spoken to him in person (he is interested in joining my company, but knows I'm gay because of my job history) so I didn't really know how I should react. We weren't talking about sexuality at all, it was just something he brought up himself. He said ""I haven't told this to anyone before but.. I'm.. technically gay"".. technically gay lol I had a little giggle at that part since it was so endearing. 

I ended up just acting like it wasn't a big deal, I just pretty much said ""oh, that's cool.""

What would y'all have done in that position? It seemed like he wanted to be comforted but I didn't really know how to handle him!"
9,"Guys with Dad bods/beer belly are hot.


I met a guy on tinder last week who was totally not my type. He was 6‚Äô0+, was not fit at all and had a dad bod. He was hairy. But HOLY fuck was i turned on by him. Like ever since then ive been searching dad bod porn and bears and all that. 

When im out in the mall i usually look at hot fit guys but mostly i notice my self looking at those hairy beer belly guys and thinking of them topping me ü§§ i also think they have he best dick to suck ü§™

Anyone else here feel the same way?"
10,"Saw two guys out on a date and made me wonder where my life is heading.


So today I was sitting at a cafe and there was a handsome homo at the table next to me. A few minutes later he was joined by a guy and it was obvious they were on a date. I wasn't intentionally watching but it was a small cafe and it was hard to not notice them. They genuinely seemed to have a great time and even snuck in an affectionate hand-holding moment half way into the date. Made me happy seeing two guys happy together but then I felt my heart plummet when I found myself thinking I might never have that. Feeling single as fuck right now!

Gaybros with partners you're incredibly lucky and single bros what do you do from feeling down?"
11,"I'm out to my parents. Like 4 hours ago.


This isn't really a question, but talking guys on this subreddit helped me through this whole thing. You guys are amazing.

My dad told me that it was ok if I'm gay. Something pretty close to that. I wrote about it here,  [https://www.reddit.com/r/askgaybros/comments/clfb4h/i\_think\_my\_parents\_think\_im\_gay/](https://www.reddit.com/r/askgaybros/comments/clfb4h/i_think_my_parents_think_im_gay/) 

I was going to come out to family in a big family announcement, but my bros here said take it slow. Today was the day I did it.

I waited until I was with both of them and said I want you know I'm gay. It thought it would be tougher than that. And my dad just said, come over here, I want to give you a hug. And we talked it all out. My mom started by asking if I wanted them to do slightly surprised or completely shocked, because they'd practiced both. I thought that was really funny. We were actually laughing.

I told them that I pretty much knew when I was 10, and they said they knew before that. I asked how they thought my brother and sisters would take it. They are all pretty old and don't live with us. Apparently they know too. Pretty much every one in the family knew. The funny thing is I knew there was something that they talked about without me, but I thought it was about my mom's cancer. 

My niece (13F)? My mom says my brother loves that I'm so comfortable doing the gay uncle thing with her, like helping sort out clothes for next year. For the record, it wasn't a gay uncle thing, it was a her mom is a fashion disaster thing. My nieces's body is changing and she needs to dress differently. But anyway, apparently she's not going to be super surprised either. 

I almost didn't cry. Then my dad told me that all their kids had their hearts broken, but they all eventually found the right person. And I'm going to get my heart broken too. But one day something will click, and he'll be the luckiest guy in the world. So this time both my parents saw me cry. But now it doesn't bother me. I'm good. 

I was going to do a family reveal tomorrow, but it's just two of my sisters coming. So I'm going to tell them tomorrow. And maybe call my brother after. Still nervous about my niece, so maybe I'll ask him if he thinks she'll be ok. 

Love u guys. I know this was way harder for a lot of you, but it meant a lot to have people to talk to."
12,"Just a small update: 5 months have passed since I called off my engagement and came out


Not a single word from my family. I tried to reach out to them but my attempt fell on deaf ears. Lifes become very demanding and I am at a point where I don't really feel anything. I feel like my heart is dead. I really miss my family. I miss being a part of it. But I guess that's what you get for being gay. Anyways. Just wanted to say hi."
13,"My husband left me and I can't get over it


He left me 5 years ago for another guy. They now have kids together. He left me a year after an accident that left me paralised from the waist down. I can't move on. I love him to this day. I cry a lot. I call him when I am drunk sometimes just to hear his voice. And today I heard he and his new husband are having a child together. 


I became so angry and I couldn't stop crying. I haven't been on a single date for 5 years. No one wants to date a cripple . I send a picture, they like me, we chat and the moment I mention I am in a wheelchair they find some excuse not to meet me. Guys in bars don't even approach me. Sometimes I think it would be best if I took some pills and ended this. I was happy before. I had a life, I had a husband, I had a job. Now I have nothing."
14,"Funny story about a roommate


So I'm on a sports team travel trip, and was hanging with my team roommate. I think he is straight and I am gay, but I am not out and want to keep it that way. So my roommate is pretty boisterous and starts thwacking me with a pillow and soon we are wrestling. I manage to get on to of him and pin his arms down, and leaning over him victorious when he stops struggling looks into my eyes and just smiles cutely. ""Kiss me"" he said, and I was like ""what"", and then thwack he headbutted me right in the nose. My dumb gay ass really believed him and now I'm sitting here with a bloody nose and bruised ego cause I lost the fight, waiting to be teased relentlessly tomorrow when he inevitably brags about it. Smh I hate being gay."
15,"Bottoms Are Really Confusing!


My boyfriend is a bottom and likes to play with dildos and plugs.  BUT he got mad at me when I wanted to keep an extra set of keys and a water bottle up his ass when we went hiking.  What‚Äôs the problem!?  It‚Äôs like extra storage, right??"

17,"I'm only attracted to older men and i don't know if it should be ok


Whenever i use Grindr or tinder to get to know people, i end up talking only to ones who are way older than me. That doesn't mean i  never contact people my age, but everytime i do no-one is interested in me (i think i am a ""twink"" don't know much about this). I am 20 and i have a huge crush on 35+ y/o men. Especially if they are bold and with a beard, but that makes me question myself a lot. I don't really have a thing for people my age since i don't think they are mature/hot/ or whatever , but is it wrong to only like older man? Maybe it's just because of their traits but i feel like people around my age aren't my type (Considering i only had 1 relationship which lasted 5 months with a 26 y/o). I don't know if i like them just for the sex or even for something more serious though .

Also i am scared to tell this to any of my friends because i believe they would think of me as a freak, but what do you guys think?."
18,"Dying dad wants to make amends - UPDATE.


I apologize for deleting everything the other day, I had a panic attack and I don't know why. It was a difficult day for me. 

There's not much to say, really. I decided to see him. He confirmed it was to clear his conscience, he said he isn't happy with my lifestyle. I left before he could finish speaking. I'm pretty sad, I was hoping he'd accept me. My brother is pissed off at him and hasn't talked to him at all since it happened. I should have just listened to you guys."
19,"Stay safe gay Bros! Just saw this in case some didn't know! Maybe Grindr can do same for when y'all travel?


https://www.reddit.com/r/Tinder/comments/cltuhb/tinder_devs_have_our_backs_even_when_my/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share

Tinder noticing when you're in an unsafe LGBT+ area and gives users warning. I think it's more for illegal like some countries for you traveling gays. 

But ye PSA:
Stay safe, be smart, stay alive and well Bros!"
