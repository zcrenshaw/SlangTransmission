0,"Never stick your foot through a glory hole


Few weekends ago my boyfriend and I decide to go to a local bathhouse to fool around and maybe fool around with someone else. Was our first time, we were fairly nervous. 

After touring the inside, we would occasionally stop and fool around with one another, before continuing to explore the building. At some point, we wind up in a stall which is roughly the size of a bathroom stall, sans bathroom. 

On either side of the walls are long rectangular holes, around mid thigh high. Boyfriend and I are entwined with one another, going at it, and for balance, I stick my foot into one of the holes, propping myself up. 

At some point, someone starts sucking on my toes from the other side. I know it was that, due to them occasionally softly nibbling them as well. At first, it was a little off-putting, but I was getting closer to orgasm with my boyfriend, so I went with it. Suddenly, the mouth stops, a moment of nothing, and then warmth. I feel some slight hair, and then the top half of my foot is engulfed. Several thrusts go by before I finally realize that my the literal top of half of my foot is IN SOMEONES ASS. 

I literally had my foot inside another persons ass. The entire top half of my foot. *within seconds*

I promptly withdrew my foot, struggling to see if my assaulted foot now resembled a fudge brownie, and burst into emotional breakdown hysterical laughter of disbelief. 

Then rushed to the showers. "
1,"I came out to my parents.. they told me I *wasn't* adopted...


This happened a couple years ago, but I still feel really badly about the situation, and feel like it was kind of fucked up from my parents. 

I was told I was adopted from the beginning of my life, so my parents were super transparent. 

It took me 21 years to come out to them because I knew their reaction would be extremely negative. 

I finally found the courage to tell them I was gay, and in tears, I told them. 

It felt like they were trying to fuck with my head, and after telling them, they were obviously in shock, but they ended up telling me that I *wasn't* adopted... I wasn't adopted?? What the fuck?

My brother being adopted, they didn't want him to feel ""different"", so they simply told me I was adopted to make it easier.. and then at 21 decide, ""Oh, now is a good time to tell him he isn't :)"".

It blew my mind and made me feel terrible inside. It's been 2 years and I still feel like I'm an adopted child, because that sort of thing becomes part of who you are while you're growing up. 

That's my coming out story :))"
2,"I'm tired of seeing the same topics!


**“how to clean out my ass hole”**

buy a douche or an enema, empty it out, pour warm water inside of it, squeeze it up your asshole and push the water out. do it multiple times until the water comes out clear.  

**“im in love with a straight guy”**

stop being a delusional bitch, you are not going to “turn” him gay, he is not interested in you. Keep it moving.  

**“i hate myself and how I look”**

then do something about it, go work out, get therapy, get surgery, tattoos to cover some shit up and whatever else you have to do to feel better about your appearance.  

**“i’m depressed and I want to end it all”**

mental health is a serious issue and you are not going to get any psychological help from a reddit post. Speak to a professional.  

**“ I hate grindr because I get rejected on it”**

then stop using the app since it is making you feel like shit. Find another app or different method to meet men.

**“how do I stretch my asshole to take bigger dicks”**

buttplugs and lube with a thick consistency.

**“I’m questioning my sexuality even though I think i’m straight”**

what is there to question when you are having homosexual feelings? NOTHING, the answers you are looking for are in the shit you are posting about. you like dudes, big fucking deal.  

 

\*\*\*Can we start sharing some thought provoking, informative, stimulating topics and discussions now?"
3,"Coworker was comparing gay people to pedophiles and I told him I have a boyfriend


He told me hes reporting me to HR because I make him uncomfortable and I'm confronting him. Should I just let his shitty plan go through?  I think I should bring it to HR separately but part of me wants to wait "
4,"I just came out


I’m pretty drunk and pretty high. Was talking to my mom on the phone and my roommate walked in the room, and I just kinda blurted out, “I’m gay.”  It was soooooo freeing.

That’s the full story. My mom continued with the story she was telling, making sure that she said “I love you” about 4 times before we got off the phone. My roommate, who’s gay, wants to take me out next week.  Nothing bad happened, and I honestly, finally, feel like I can be myself after all these years. 

(Also, no question, just needed to share this)

Happy Saturday night!

5,"I lost my boyfriend a little over a month ago


I don’t know how to feel right now. My boyfriend, 33, passed away in my presence...I’m 23...nursing student, he was a Detroit police officer....I woke up at 4:55 AM to him waving along the side of our bed...I asked him, “Babe, what’s wrong?” He just said my chest really hurts. I didn’t think much of it. Who thinks chest pain at 33 is something serious? He went up to the kitchen to get a glass of water, and I heard his body hit the floor. The sink and the drinking faucet were both on. I find him on the kitchen floor gasping for air. I’m panicking at this point flipping out. It took me a split second to go into nurse mode. No carotid pulse. Pupils are reactive. Was it a stroke? Is his heart stopped? I’m calling 911 to get the emergency response started. It took all my power in me to start CPR on him. It was what I needed to do. I had to save him. Counting out loud the compressions was the longest time of my life. At the same time, I’m calling my work telling them what’s going on, putting his German Shepherd outside, locking my cat in the room, unlocking the front and side door for EMS...he had this decorticate posture as he was gasping for air. I will never forget it. I’m calling his mom telling her she needs to get there now. Eventually, EMS shows up and takes over. They continue compressions, start an IO, hook him up to a monitor, start sympathomimetic drugs...he’s shocked twice. His mom shows up. Ballistic, as any other family member would be with their very young son. I keep my composure and tell her we need to go in the living room. I’m trying my hardest to comfort her the best I can. Everything felt numb at that point. They get a pulse back for a second, stabilize him, and prep to take him to the hospital 5 minutes away. At this point I’m thinking, “Okay. It’s the calm before the storm. For a couple minutes, it’s okay.” I drive his mom and I to the ED. I’m just thinking in my head, “How long was his brain hypoxia? Did I do everything I could’ve done? Is he going to be himself after this? He never would want to be hooked up to life support.” We get to the ED and sit in a waiting room, for the longest 3 minutes of our lives. That’s when the doctors come in...with the most inevitable news...”Don is dead.” I’m numb. I’m confused. His mom is hysterical. This was only the tip of the iceberg. Funeral, police service, everything happened within a week. Grief set in, was off work for a month while trying to deal with nursing school and keep my grades. A month has gone by, I’ve felt happy. Better than the previous weeks. But being with his family tonight and his police partner tonight just fucking destroyed me. I had to excuse myself and leave to the bar we went to. I needed to drink. The only way I can feel my emotions is to drink so I can grieve. Antidepressants I’m on have fucked me and have me feeling numb. It’s a very good thing but also the worst thing in the world. 

TLDR; Boyfriend died. I had to attempt to resuscitate him. Shit is complicated. Being around his family and hearing them talk about him makes me feel terrible. I don’t know how to cope or deal with this. "

7,"Caught BF on Grindr second time. Think it’s time to throw in the towel.


Gonna keep this short

About a year ago I saw my boyfriend chatting on Grindr.  We are in a monogamous relationship. I called him out on it,  he said he didn’t cheat and he didn’t leave bed for two days because of depression.  I told him I forgive him, but that we need honest and open communication,  so I want him to tell me if and when he downloads them again and what he needs in a relationship.  Meaning if he need some openness, then I’m willing to discuss,  but we must have open and honest communication at all times.

Well, one year later,  we are going to a show and he opens his phone to get the tickets.  I’m looking over his shoulder and notice he has not only Grindr but Scruff downloaded and he’s frantically freaking out and getting out of that area because he knows I was looking over his shoulder.

He knows I saw.  Usually I take him to work but today I told him I don’t want to interact with him right now,  and to get to work himself.  So I haven’t talked to him about it yet,  but I know he’s aware.

I’m not upset about him being on apps,  I’m upset because he revived me again.  This is someone who’s been very good to me.  We’ve grown together.  We have a strong relationship.  I planned to marry him.

But I cannot deal with deceit.  I’m an honest person and I expect the same respect to be given to me.   

I have strong firm boundaries.  I just don’t know how to enforce them or what to do right now.  I still believe he hasn’t cheated and he uses those apps to get attention (he has low self esteem),  but regardless of why he’s on them,  he’s not being honest ... and that’s all I want

Very very very very disappointed.  And if I decide to leave him,  man it’s going to really fucking hurt.  Just don’t know where to go from here. "
8,"UPDATE. ‘Straight’ friend sleptover my house. Slept beside me. Got intimate.

9,"Yesterday my sister called me a virgin, and today she called me a whore


Apparently she doesn't consider gay sex to be ""real"" sex, so when she found out yesterday that I had never slept with a girl, she started calling me a virigin. But then today when she saw that I had grindr on my phone she called me a whore. She failed to see the irony here. 

Which is it sis? I can't be both. "
10,"I think average but well taken care of guys are hotter than models


Idk, but whenever I see someone who looks like a model, or the super manicured super fit guys on instagram and youtube posting content, I don't feel anything. This isn't meant to say I think they're ugly....the opposite in fact. They are always gorgeous. But Idk, I find normal dudes that aren't perfect and aren't trying to hard to be insanely more sexually attractive.
"
11,"Why do I feel weird and different, as a gay man, wanting a monogamous relationship? I can't be the only one...


I know a few gay couples who have been dating for years and are in open relationships. I also hear people say they could never have sex with just one person for the rest of their life. My last partner didn't get why, after 2 yrs of dating, I got upset he was sexting guys on Grindr.

I am 27 and some of my straight friends from high school have been married for 5+ years to the same person, have kids, families. I don't think their social circles are talking about open relationships, or him on bumble and her on tinder while they're cuddling in bed. 

It just seems so normal in gay relationships, and it's not me. I hope to not sound like I'm complaining or comparing in the wrong way, I want to meet a gay guy who wants monogamy and is not promiscuous, and I haven't found one yet. "
12,"Got catfished for the first time...


Dude sends me pictures and appears to be a remarkably handsome white guy in his early 30s. 6 pack and everything, the pictures seem legit. 

He invites me to his hotel and says he’s downstairs, I show up outside and notice a pudgy young guy who’s not white nervously standing in front of the doorway. The man gives me a creepy stare as I walk past him through the entryway expecting the handsome 30something to be awaiting me in the lobby.

 My suspicions are confirmed when there is no handsome dude in the lobby, instead the catfisher guy follows me inside, walks up to me and says “Hi are you {my name} ?” with that same creepy smile. 

I say “yes, and you obviously sent me fake pictures so I’m leaving” as I proceed to walk out the door. To my surprise, he looked very surprised by this. 

The guy then messages me calling me a racist Faggot...

What the fuck is wrong with some people? Are they that insane they think I’m not going to care about blatant and obvious lies? That I’ll just date / fuck them regardless of their crazy dishonesty ? "
13,"JK Rowling keeps Queerbaiting


J.K. Rowling recently talked about Dumbledore and Grindelwald’s 'intense' and 'physical' sexual love affair, which you will never see because they are not details in her books or movies. Free publicity for her just in time for DVD sales of the dismal Fantastic Beasts. The fake wokeness from her is getting ridiculous."
14,"My friend kissed me and now I’m confused.


Last night I was at my friend’s house and we were watching the TV when he looks over at me and kisses me and tells me he likes me. I was shocked at first... I could have sworn he was straight. And I just tell him that I like him too (which is true tbh) but I had never really thought anything of him because I thought he liked girls and just saw me as a friend. 

I knew I wasn’t totally straight but I thought I was way more into girls. But now I’m kind of looking at my sexuality and my friend in a new light. Should I talk to him about it? Have any of you had a similar experience? "
15,"Cheating boyfriend (just venting)


I don’t really know why I’m writing all this. I guess I just need to tell it to someone and get it off my chest. My boyfriend and I, we were together for 10 years until recently, when I found out he’s been cheating on me for quite a long time. And I found out about it in the most ironical way possible – his lover paid me a visit to talk to me about letting my boyfriend go. Actually, this whole thing is quite complicated because I wasn’t the only person my boyfriend lied to, but I’ll get to that eventually. 

So when this guy appeared on my doorstep, I didn’t understand anything. I had never seen him before but he knew who I was though, he was calling me by my first name and he was kinda surprised I knew nothing about him and that my boyfriend hadn’t told me anything about him. He then told me that he and my boyfriend, they’re dating for HALF A YEAR and he has come to talk to me man to man about this situation we’re in.

I was furious at first, I couldn't believe it, I was yelling at this guy to get out of my house and he admitted that dating a guy who’s in relationship with someone else wasn’t the best thing to do but he told me to face the reality once and for all and that he knows all about our relationship, proceeding to tell me things I heard the first time in my life. He told me that my boyfriend and I, we don’t talk to each other for 2 years, don’t sleep with each other for even longer and that I’m very sick and my boyfriend must take care of me and that’s why he cannot break up with me and go live with him. My boyfriend told him all those things about me, things that are completely false – I’m not sick, we talked to each other and slept with each other every single day. We had a normal, loving ( or so I thought ) relationship. So basically my boyfriend was lying to his lover as well about the situation he had with me. He was lying to both of us.

Hearing all this was just heartbreaking to me. I was such an idiot that I trusted my boyfriend completely and now here is his lover in front of me. It was devastating to see how good he knows our house. While talking to him, I accidentally spilled some water on the floor and he simply got up and went to grab a towel. He knew where every single thing was in this house which means that he has been here a lot. When I was at work, thinking that my boyfriend is waiting for me, he was spending time in our bed with his lover. And this guy was so determined, he was begging me to let my boyfriend go because he loves him so much and he’s tired of living this way, he wants him for himself only. And in a way, I could understand him. In his place, I also wouldn’t want to share a man with someone else.

Later I confronted my boyfriend who first denied everything but when he realized his lover actually came to see me, finally confessed. His explanation was that one person cannot possess all the qualities necessary for a successful relationship and that he needs both of us in his life in order to feel happy and content. When he spends some time with me, he misses his lover and when he spends some time with his lover, he misses me. That’s the bullshit he needs. He wanted me to agree to have an open relationship, I was like – what do you mean? First, I don’t do open relationships to begin with, second, your lover wants you for himself only and, third, I don’t want you at all anymore after what you’ve done.

We were living in his apartment, so I packed my stuff and left. He keeps calling me but this thing is over. He hurt me a lot and it’s painful to realize that 10 years spent in a relationship are down the drain now and meant nothing to him. I trusted him, all these years I thought he’s an honest, loyal man who respects me. I feel like such a total idiot. How could I be so stupid and not realize he had a lover? He was cheating on me for half a year, not one day, not one week, not one month – half a year – and I had no idea. He came home to me every evening, we slept in the same bed every night. No suspicion, none. If there was a problem, if there was something he wasn’t satisfied with, why not come to me and talk about it? That’s what couples do, they communicate. Why lie, why cheat? I don’t understand it. 

Anyway, I don’t know what’s going to happen between him and that guy and I honestly don’t care. He wanted me to let him go, well, I have now. There is no way back to me for him, so he can go wherever he wants now. I’ll need some time to heal myself.

16,"I'm actually glad i'm gay and would no longer choose to be straight if i had the option.


A few years ago if i was given the chance i would of turned myself straight, but after meeting a guy at a club, going back to his, waking up and doing stuff and then spending a few hours learning to play magic the gathering, i realised that actually i'm glad i'm gay and the dynamic's you get with guys feel so much more diverse than those you would ever have with a girl. 

&amp;#x200B;

I don't think this is said enough. We have pride were we can be proud to be open with who we are but rarly do i see people say they wouldn't change if given the chance

For those struggling now, It does get easier eventually. Stay strong"
