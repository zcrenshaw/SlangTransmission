"A story about tech support at Sony


I hope this fits, although it's from the perspective of the user. Reading about Sony finally discontinuing their PS2 repair service reminded me of one of my favorite stories my dad tells, about Sony's ""repair service"". Also on mobile so forgive any formatting or spelling errors.


Back in the 1980s, my dad played basketball for the New Zealand National Team, and travelled all over the world for games and tournaments. On this occasion, he was in Tokyo for a big tournament. While he was there, his fancy new Sony Walkman (the original) stopped working. He set out to find an electronics store, which, being in Japan, couldn't be that hard to find. The only complicating factor is that he didn't speak a word of Japanese. 


He first went to the concierge at his hotel, who luckily spoke a few words of English. He explained his problem and the concierge seemed to understand, responding by writing an address on a card: ""go here"". My dad took the card and showed it to a taxi driver, who drove him through the streets of Tokyo before pulling over at his destination. 


He paid his fare and then looked around to find the electronics store... Only there wasn't one. There were plenty of opportunities for miscommunication and he nearly resigned to going back to the hotel. Then he looked up... And up, and up, to a big sign on top of the building in front of him: ""SONY"".


He had been sent, surely with all the best intentions, to Sony Headquarters. He laughed, but was fairly that they would not have a repair centre inside. However he decided, in a last gasp effort to save his Walkman, that the reception inside might speak more English and might be able to direct him  somewhere more useful. He walked in and explained his problem, thinking he might get another card with another address. Instead they asked him to wait and made a phone call in Japanese, which lasted a minute of two. Feeling a bit embarrassed, he started preparing to leave, but suddenly receptionist got up and walked him to an elevator, pressed the number for a very high floor, and then left the elevator before the doors could close.


So here is my dad, very confused at this point, alone in an elevator rocketing up to the highest floors of Sony HQ. The doors open to an empty hallway with several unmarked doors. Again, he waits a minute of two, and right before he can abort and go back down, a door opens and three small (they were probably normal sized, but everyone is small to my 6'9 dad), Japanese men wearing lab coats, pop out from a door and come over to him. They take the Walkman from his hand and start examining and discussing it, then disappear with it back through the door, closing it behind them.


It suddenly dawns on him, and, if it hadn't already, you: this isn't any sort of repair centre. This is the bleeding edge. This is Sony R&amp;D, on the highest floors of one of the tallest buildings in Tokyo, Sony HQ. These guys don't just build electronics, they design them! And they're fixing my dad's Walkman. 


Now, we Kiwis are a very understated people (except when in comes to rugby) and the fact that he ended up here, wasting the time of some of the smartest people in the world so that he can listen to his new AC/DC album, is both bewildering and incredibly embarrassing. But at this point it would be even more rude to leave, so he sits and waits while his walkman is fixed by the guys who probably invented it.


Eventually they come out, waving his walkman and excitedly showing that it now works. He pulls out his wallet, but through the language barrier, they make it very clear that they will accept no money. So he thanks then profusely, goes on his way with a story he, and I, and maybe now you, weil never forget."
