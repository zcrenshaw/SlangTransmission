"[Update] I (28f) am tired of fixing everything for husband (32m)


[https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/9wnsk7/i\_28f\_am\_tired\_of\_fixing\_everything\_for\_husband/](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/9wnsk7/i_28f_am_tired_of_fixing_everything_for_husband/)

It's been a few months since I posted about being exhausted by my husband's lack of ability (will?) to makeup after arguments and/or saying cruel and hurtful things. Despite a brief period of ""improvement"" he quickly went back to his habit of what I considered abusive tendencies.

I joined a support group shortly after my original post. A few weeks after that my coworker walked into our shared office and found me crying at my desk...again. I've been friends with CW for a while, careful to talk as little about my home life as possible and for some reason that day I just broke. I let out years of feelings on the poor man and he just sat and listened. Him just being a kind human made me realize how bad I had let things get. Simple kindness is strange to me. People asking how I am and actually caring is a foreign concept that I distrust. I felt (and feel) stupid and pathetic.

In the past month I felt myself very drastically distancing myself from my husband. He became suspicious, went through my phone, and read my Ejournal. He was furious when he read that I spoke to CW about my feelings, accused me of cheating, and threatened divorce. This time I just said ""fine"". So we're done. I moved into the guest room

A few of the original commenters called BS on the autism excuse he used, they were right. A few nights after I moved into the guest room he stumbled in (very drunk) and said that he had been cheating on me. I don't even care if its true. The second I agreed to the divorce I just felt relieved. I also feel guilty for being relieved but the second I agreed, I realized his s\*\*t isn't my problem anymore.

I'm made regular appointments with an abuse counselor at my college who's helping me sort through the nonsense I put myself through. I blame myself largely for enabling his behavior, maybe if I had tried harder to communicate earlier in our marriage we could have fixed it. Or if I had not been so afraid of the fighting and avoided raising issues, we could have made it. I'm not sure but it's not really relevant anymore.

TL:DR: Original commenters called it, he just didn't care enough. Husband didn't change, threatened divorce again, I said ""fine"". We're over, and I just feel relieved.

"My [25 F] lazy boyfriend [26 M] always lies and pretends he's sick when someone in our household falls ill. How can I confront him without seeming crazy?


**tldr: I've always thought that my lazy partner of four years lies and pretends to be sick whenever anyone in our house is sick, and though an odd circumstance of our friend saying she's sick when she isn't, I've basically caught him lying but don't know how to confront him, since I cannot tell him that our friend isn't actually 'sick'.**   


Okay, this is a bit strange but here we go,   


My boyfriend 'Dave' and I live with three mutual friends, 'Steve', 'Anne' and 'Vicky'. My boyfriend is extremely lazy, right now he's out of work and looking for a job so I'm the breadwinner, and he is looking for work as slowly as humanly possible. Anyway, every time I've been legitimately sick I don't receive help or support from Dave because he's immediately 'also sick' even though he never looks it. If any of our friends are sick then, like clockwork, he's also sick the very next day- it always feels like a convenient way to get out of cleaning, cooking... whatever. Obviously it's normal to get sick when someone you're living with is, but... every time? Sometimes I thought this was just in my head, but now I think I've been right all along because of an odd series of events.   


Our friend Anne is very busy, working part-time and doing a difficult post-grad course. She appears to be very together, but since her and I are very close, I know this isn't always the case- she's also extremely private. Long story short, about 6 months ago, she started experiencing chronic pain because of an injury. Her GP prescribed her painkillers, and she admitted to me about three days ago that she got hooked... she started lying to her doc for months that it still hurt because she subconsciously started relying on the opiates. Anyway, she confessed this to me and said she's going to ween off/withdraw, she's using sick leave for a week and has her studies all in order so she can be sick and sad at home without external obligations- she's been told withdrawal will be terrible for about a week, and will mirror flu like symptoms. She asked that I not tell anyone else, because she's ashamed and of course I won't. I don't judge her, I want to be supportive and I will not tell a soul.   


So, Anne starts the withdrawal process and tells the others that she's come down with a bad flu and... the very next day? Dave is 'also sick'- fuck off! Anne is withdrawing from opiates, you do not have the flu! He doesn't look sick at all, but he's not looking for work, helping out at home, cooking or anything... and I cannot tell him about Anne obviously. I am so frustrated but I can't voice why to him, without accusing him of something without 'evidence'.... or at least, it'll seem that way.   


Anyone else had a partner like this? What the hell do I do? It's infuriating. "
"My (26M) Dad (56M) expects affection all of a sudden from me and my sister (22F) after withholding affection and being a an overall too strict parent our whole lives. And since we don’t provide the affection he wants, he gets upset.


My dad is a typical Asian dad. All that mattered growing up was school and grades and getting in to a good university and remained very emotionally distant. He’s the type of parent would would say “what happened to the other 5%” if you told him you got a 95% on a test. He never showed any affection, physical or otherwise growing up and he was probably emotionally abusive. I once got a B for my final grade in one of my high school classes and he told me I would not even get in to community college. His treatment of my sister actually led to her cutting herself for a short period of time. She has thankfully recovered. I don’t want to go on any rants but you get the idea. He wasn’t the best dad. 


All of a sudden now that we are both adults and have our own lives, he seems to have completely changed. He apparently constantly misses us and gets upset when we don’t call him but we talk to our mom all the time. We also love showing affection to our mom, telling her we love and and giving her hugs, but we don’t like doing it with our dad. Not because we don’t want to but it’s just uncomfortable for us that he expects this all of a sudden after not showing it to us our whole lives. And then he gets jealous of the affection we show Mom. He also tries to literally buy my sisters affection by buying her a new car, new laptop, etc. he tried it with me but I don’t let him. 


Honestly, my sister and I prefer to remain emotionally distant and in relatively low contact. But he always guilt trips us. How do we deal with this? 


TLDR; emotionally distant typical Asian dad provided no affection during childhood and all of a sudden expects it now and doesn’t understand why we don’t treat him the way he wants. How do we deal with it?"
"Am I (27F) leading on my close friend (30M)? [UPDATE]


Prev Post: [https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/b0nqsm/am\_i\_27f\_leading\_on\_my\_close\_friend\_30m/](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/b0nqsm/am_i_27f_leading_on_my_close_friend_30m/)

I decided to just take some time and sit with the words for a bit and give my friend some space. 

Original plan was so slowly ebb away (as it wouldn't cause as much drama) but as with friends you have shared a decade with, you tend to share favorite places, and are invited to family gatherings.

I saw my friend at a family birthday party. I didn't know he'd be there, nor was it like I was in charge of who invited him.

I try to keep my distance, hanging out with others, but of course (because I didn't tell him my plan to just end this) he comes over and starts talking with us.

Eventually... we get yet another friend doing the whole ""Ugh, you guys are so good with one another, I see you together all the time. Why aren't you dating? Give X (my niece) a cousin.""

We kinda looked at one another and I can fucking *see* the excitement of this talk. He starts talking that ""We're working up to it,"" and I shake my head and just blurted out, ""I'm not attracted to him, nor do I ever want kids.""

Which. Turned into this weird argument, about why would I say that in front of them (the mutual friend), and why am I not attracted (reasons lacking again) to him. I'm not a super confrontational person, so I just shrug and try to politely and sternly explain, ""I'm just not. I don't think I need a reason.""

We let the exchange sizzle down, and eventually it's just me and him again. Not wanting to really start another argument, I just head to my niece's area and start talking to her, but he follows and literally starts placing his hands on my waist, and at this point I had to stop and firmly grab his wrist and shove it down.

I told him I do not appreciate the touch, and he was starting the whole ""I can't help it,"" and it angered me, so I just told him, ""Fine then, I'm leaving, because I'm not going to ruin this party nor am I going to be uncomfortable."" I start heading out and he's following after me, and I had to wait until we were well and away from the party before I could talk again.

I told him I wasn't interested, and he asked again. At this point, I told him I'm not interested in being a desperate man's last resort (because he constantly complains that other girls don't like him), and being around him is undoing the hard work I've made in therapy when it came to the touching.

He apologizes, promises to work on it, to make the effort, and I'm just- I'm someone who looks at the words people say, so hearing him say ""he'd make an EFFORT"" told me he was never even trying to start with. At this point I'm just angrier and almost crying, and he's trying to comfort me with a hug, but I just held him at arms length. 

I told him I wanted space. I am upset, and do not want him texting me/talking to me. I told him I'd let him know if I want to stay friends, but right now, I want the space, and I need him to respect that.

He reluctantly agreed, trying to guilt me by saying he'd been uncomfortable with my presence anyways, but I don't really care. I vocalized my discomfort, he could have done the same.

I'm hurt and angry, but don't have any real intention of seeing him. The touching is making me anxious, more so than ever, and I think I need to unload to my therapist about it. I'm hurting because it's ten whole years of memories that now have this ugly stain on it, and I'm just ready to move on. If I'm more comfortable without him than with him, I think making new friends will easier.

I'm going to listen to my comfort for now. Thank you guys for the words and harsh truth. As much as it hurt, I needed to hear it.

TL;DR: Guy friends does stupid shit again, and I took your advice about ending the friendship. Everything hurts, but I'm hopeful about making new friends."
"My[30M] wife's [27F] longtime friend [28M] admitted he is in love with her.


I'll be sharing this thread with my wife so she can read everyone's responses and advice. We will try and provide an update as well. 

My wife has a guy friend of almost 10 years, they have no sexual or romantic history. However before her and I started dating he confessed his feelings for her. She turned him down but accidentally gave him false hope by trying to spare his feelings. Instead of telling him that she wasn't interested, she told him his shortcomings which included long distance. He was moving away for work and she told him she didn't want a long distance relationship.

Many years later he moves back. Her and I are now married and he seems to accept this. She assumes that he no longer holds a flame for her and wants to resume the friendship. Everything started out well and we all got along, but little red flags started to emerge.

He became focused on participating in activities that she does but I do not. One of which was regularly attending church. He grew up Religious but was not an avid church goer. A few weeks ago my wife wanted me to attend a particular Sunday service. When she told him that I was coming along he basically asked: ""Why is he coming if he is not religious?"" Her answer was that I was there to support her in her faith. This was a very minor incident and we didn't think much of it. The three of us attended church that morning and everything seemed fine.

Every encounter I had with him has been either neutral or pleasant. Then one evening the three of us attended a piano concert. Her and I arrived just as it started and took our seats next to him after a quick greeting. She wasn't feeling well so she snuggled up close to me. At intermission he looked visibly upset and said that he is leaving. We asked what was wrong and he alluded that we weren't paying enough attention to him. He was also upset that we didn't arrive early so we could chat and hangout, which wasn't discussed. However, we did invite him to hangout at our place before the concert, which he didn't. The point of the evening was to enjoy listening to music together. I suspected that he was upset because I was getting all of her attention. Anyway, he left and we didn't dwell on it.  

Then yesterday he refused to go to church with her because he found out that I will be attending. When asked why he essentially said that my presence in a church as a non-believer offends him. To make things 100% clear: I do not criticize or defame Religion, I am simply not Religious. I am respectful at services, I follow the norms, I listen, and I don't play on my phone.

At this point my wife and I try to analyze what is really going on. We had our suspicions and eventually via text he admitted that he is still in love with her. He also confessed that when she turned him down years ago, he seriously considered quitting his career to marry her. **Not pursue or date, he was going to quit his career and propose to her.** My wife isn't interested in him but wants to salvage the friendship. She is going to talk with him today about it. I support her in this and we both agree that the following needs to happen:

* He has to get over her or at least control his feeling.
* He cannot be passive aggressive, aggressive, or negative towards us just because we are married and affectionate towards each other. (Our PDA is very mild by the way).
* He needs to accept that I am more important in her life than he is. 
* He doesn't have to be my friend, but he has to get along with me.
* He cannot cause any tension in our marriage. 

If he does not agree to or cannot follow these rules, he is not welcome in our lives. Are we going about this the right way? Any advice, criticisms, guidance, etc...?

**TL;DR**

Before I met my wife, her longtime friend asked her out and was turned down. He then moved away for work. Her and I started dating and we eventually got married. Years later he moves back. Him and my wife resume their friendship. He gradually starts acting weird and passive aggressive towards me. Eventually he admits that he is still in love with her. He confesses that years ago when she turned him down he seriously considered quitting his career to marry her. My wife isn't interested in him but wants to salvage the friendship. I support her in this, but would appreciate advice, comments, etc... "
"My (35F) Mom (65) and Dad (65) are upset that I declined my future sister-in-law's (25F) invitation to be a bridesmaid at her wedding.


Today my brother's finance (I'll call her A) sent me a text message asking me if i'd want to be one of her bridesmaids. In the text she said it was no pressure but she wanted to ask. She is super chill and laid back and so I wasn't surprised it wast just a text and not the usual card and a gift charade. Now, I have been a bridesmaid six times, the last one was six months ago for one of my very best friends. I promised myself (and my therapist) that it would be my last time doing it. It is not a job I am good at nor enjoy. Weddings and large crowds make me anxious. I hate getting my hair and makeup done, wearing dresses, all of it. I've always been this way. If i ever get married it will be a small dinner party, no ceremony. I do not want to be the center of attention. That's just me. For a long time I thought I was weird and not normal and wished I wasn't the way that I am. But i have done a lot of work in the past 5 years (consistent therapy since age 30, and also sober now for almost two years) and I am finally starting to feel comfortable in my own skin, and beleiving that I am *enough*, just the way I am.

&amp;#x200B;

So anyway, I replied to her text. I said I was honored that she would ask me, but feel I would be more useful to her on the sidelines. She repiled that she 1000% understands, and she was happy that I felt comfortable being straight up with her.

&amp;#x200B;

Then my mom found out that I said no. I told her exactly what I said to A. I added (this was over text) that ""she understands me, and I love that about her."" It was a subtle dig at my mom because she doesn't understand me and she never will. My mom said it was ""the rudest thing she's ever heard of"" and she was ""so embarrassed"" I did that. I hung up on her.

&amp;#x200B;

I guess mom calls A. Not sure what was said in their phone conversation. A texts me, ""lol duddee.. your mom. I told her that I just want everyone to be happy and comfortable at my wedding. So I hope she understands."" I further explained to A that my mom was a big reason I know I can't be involved. I am not the daughter she wanted, and I continue to fall short and disappoint her. A has definitely been witness to a few of my mom's meltdowns, so she is not immune to this situation. A said she supports me and will always love me and never judge me, and to try and not let my mom get to me.

&amp;#x200B;

I blocked my mom. When we get in arguments she has a tendency to call and text over and over, especially if i don't respond. I have tried to set boundaries with her in the past, but i guess I haven't mastered that yet. So then my Dad texts me the following:

&gt;I just learned that you turned A down when she asked you to be in her wedding.  
I would like to hear from you why you think that is something that is normal or reasonable and does not hurt A or \[your brother\].  
I would love to hear what your therapist thinks about it. Set up a session and we will go and learn why we should not be disturbed by your selfish behavior.  
Dad

He also called and told me he was disturbed by what happened. When i tried to explain to him that this has nothing to do with him or my mom, he started to mock me. So I hung up. My heart is racing again even thinking about that phone call.

&amp;#x200B;

This is not the first time both my parents have referred to me in such ways as ""not normal"" or ""disturbed."" When my mom found out I had an eating disorder in my early twenties, and had sought outside help, she called me a ""pathetic loser"" in front of my therapist. My parents also have no idea that I'm sober, because they are so judgmental I have this vision of them admonishing me for ever being an alcoholic in the first place. *THEY* both need therapy. Which my brothers and I have suggested multiple times. But they'll never go. Right now I would not agree to therapy with them because of how the last time went.

&amp;#x200B;

I am actually a pretty well-rounded, great person. I have tons of friends, my bosses love me. I have a college degree. I don't know why I'm telling you all of this. I guess I'm still trying to convince myself that I am fine and making progress and doing my best every single day. I'm not a ""freak"" just because i don't want to be a bridesmaind.

&amp;#x200B;

Where do I go from here?

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR I (35F) don't want to be a bridesmaid in my brother's wedding. My parents are furious. They are harassing and disparaging me and I don't know where to go from here. "
"Husband (31M) just basically told me (30F) he can get away with things because he’s “bigger than me”


My husband and I just had a really bad fight. We had plans to do dinner with his family on Sunday to celebrate his nephew’s birthday. But then I just got a text from my family that they’re going to do dinner on Sunday to celebrate all family members’ birthdays from the past couple months. Since I only get to see my family once every couple of months and we see my husband’s family practically every week, I asked if we could go to my family’s thing instead especially since he had already gone to his nephew’s birthday celebration earlier this week (I couldn’t go because I was sick.) He got really upset and said we had already made plans for his nephew’s birthday. So I tried to compromise and asked if we could see his family earlier that day on Sunday. He still didn’t like that idea and wanted to see if his family could celebrate on Saturday instead. I agreed and started a tv show while he was texting his family. He told me to turn it off since he hates the show I’m watching. I told him to go to the other room then since we only have the one tv. He got really mad when I didn’t turn it off and he grabbed the controller from me and turned the tv off. He’s done this a few times before and it makes my blood boil more than anything. I turned the tv on again and he grabbed the remote from me again and turned it off. I told him that he was the most controlling person I’ve ever met. He wouldn’t let me have the remote back so I just got on my phone instead. Then when he was done texting he turned on the tv. I turned the tv off and asked him why he should be able to get to turn on the tv when he wants when he just barely made sure I couldn’t watch tv. He said he was going to turn on a show we could both watch. Then he said he can do stuff like that because he’s “bigger than me.” That made me extremely upset and I turned off the tv, telling him that if I just let him do stuff like that then he’s going to think it’s ok to continue treating me like that. He started getting really aggressive and grabbed my face with his hand and warned me not to do it again. At this point I’m scared of him but also SO mad at him for thinking he can control me like that. He turned on the tv and I turned it off, again stating that I’m not going to let him think it’s ok to treat me that way. He grabbed my face again and put a fist up to my face, threatening me. Then he grabbed my phone and with me trying to hold onto my phone it ended up scratching up my hand, then he threw my phone on the floor, breaking my phone case. He kept saying how I was power struggling. He has now left and I have no idea what to do. Thoughts? I could use any kind of advice right now. 

TL;DR

Husband and I had a huge fight and I don’t know what to do to repair things. I know I don’t handle the fights well and that it’s just as much my fault but his anger scares me sometimes."
"I [26F] accidentally went on a date with someone I had worked with [30sM] and now everyone's annoyed at me, including my boyfriend [29M]


Yeah I know it sounds suspect, accidentally going on a date? I’ll explain….


Like 3 days ago my boss got a message on Linkedin from a former client who had been nominated for a prize for a project I had been consulting on. There was an award ceremony and he asked my boss in the message if he could take me as his plus one as all his co-workers were going anyway and his original +1 had dropped out. He also said he wanted our company to be involved in awards as a thanks for our help. It sounded pretty cool and I had no real plans for Friday night (he apologized for late notice). I checked with my boyfriend that he didn’t mind me going out (I would have just stayed in and hung out with him otherwise) and he said go for it. 


So the ceremony was last night and it was a pretty good time. I didn’t really know anyone else apart from him so naturally I spent a lot of the night talking to him but we were on a table with like 8 of his coworkers so it was often like a table wide conversation. There was also a free bar so there was quite a lot of drinking and after the ceremony was over, there was dancing. We all danced together in a group, at no point was it just me and him dancing together or anything like that. 


At the end of the night he was like I had a fun night, really happy that you came, do you want to go for a drink. Initially, I was like sure, who else is coming? (thinking he had invited the whole table). Then he said he meant just us. I was like oh no sorry, I don’t want you to get the wrong impression, I have a boyfriend. 


This is when he started to get kinda defensive and was like why did you agree to be a +1 I and flirt and dance with me all night if you weren’t interested? I think this is a pretty big accusation. At no point do I think I was flirting with him and definitely never intentionally?!?! I was totally clueless to his intentions so he maybe felt the night was different but it never felt like a “date” at all to me. Mostly it felt a group of people on a night out. But anyway, I ended up apologozing for “giving him the wrong impression” (which I don’t think I did but I just wanted to leave). 


I then asked my boyfriend If could come to his because I wanted to tell him about my weird evening. I told him the whole story and then he was annoyed AT ME because apparently I hadn’t made it clear that it was to be +1 for another guy and so basically it was like I went on a date with another guy? Especially when there was free alcohol and dancing??!?!? Maybe im being naïve but if a guy asks your boss through linkedin if you want to go to a work-based function, it doesn’t feel like a date.


So yeah, I feel like I’ve done nothing but now I’ve pissed everyone off. I’m not sure about to how to deal with this situation? Should I make an effort to talk to the guy and clear the air? I don’t really want to but I’m worried that maybe the situation could affect work?

Does my bf have a point? In hindsight its easy to look back and be like oh yeah, it was sort of like a date but I didn’t know that was his intention???


tldr: got asked to go to an awards ceremony thing by someone I had previously done work with. He thought it was a date, i did not realize and now he's annoyed and so is my boyfriend. "
"Friend [37/F] is about to be turned-down for a promotion she has dreamed of for years. I [36/F] know it's coming and don't know how to support her or what to do.


Sorry, never posted here before and didn't know I needed a tl;dr (it is at the bottom). Reposting. 

&amp;#x200B;

I  used to work on a small team for a division of a multinational company.  We used to primarily be staffed by what were called “old timers”  basically people who were close to being of a pensionable age who didn’t  want the hustle. That culture shifted and a lot of young blood has been  brought in. I formerly worked there and was given a lateral move out. A  colleague “Tina” still works there. Recently an opening for Director  came up and Tina came to me for help. She's been doing overtime and working hard to get noticed for this position. She's well qualified for it and has extensive experience at the company, so she was given a chance to interview for it.

Tina  is a single mother who has overcome poverty in childhood,  racists/bigots in the industry and worked hard to support her kids.  She’s had health issues but always fought hard. Tina is tenacious and  hardworking, but there are issues – she struggles in some areas and  while she’d definitely make a great director as she’s contentious, kind  and courteous, the role is evolving and may be a bit of a stretch.  Nonetheless, I helped her with her application and presentation. Beyond being colleagues, she and  I are friends; we spend a lot of time outside of work together (we’re  the only women of color in our respective areas) and share a lot of our  deep feelings and thoughts. She worked hard and put together a good  presentation. I was really proud of her. She presented this morning at  9:30 and got through it and was out by 10:00.

Most  of the other applicants were internal and interviewed yesterday but one  person was recommended by a senior VP in a different department. The  guy who was recommended is a 30-year-old hot-shot. He will soon graduate  from an Ivy League MBA and is the definition of corporate style. They  gave him a last-minute presentation slot immediately following Tina. I  attended all of the presentations (I am not on the hiring committee) but  was there to support Tina and see how the presentations went.

When  the hotshot gave his presentation, it wasn’t even close. The 20 of us  sat in the room and were dumbfounded. Not only was his presentation  visually appealing but he noticed details none of us ever did and he  developed a pitch that was so innovative that our AVP asked to use a tag  line he created. His technical analysis was so spot-on that it was  spooky. He understood issues facing our business unit without having to  be told and had ready solutions to solve the problems. Questions they  asked him were more about how he’ll do things *when*  he takes over the role. It was made very clear to him that this was his  job and they even provided an unofficial tentative start date. It is  very clear that he understands the industry and his past experiences,  such as professional work experience as well as winning top case  competitions and academic awards prepared him very well. The  presentations were in totally different leagues.

After  he finished, he made a self-deprecating joke and took questions. He  thanked us and left. We all sat there for a minute chatting when the AVP  very loudly told the HR director to offer significantly above the  salary and hammer-out a start date immediately and get a contract  signed. The VP who recommended him knew him from the MBA program as the  VP is a case coach there. He said he’d be his reference and they are  skipping all the formalities and going right to the offer.

Tina has no idea. She was so happy with her performance and she's *sure*  she nailed it. She did well, about as well as the other candidates, but  this guy is out-and-out in a different league. Just based on that I too  would hire the other guy. She's sitting on cloud 9 at her desk and  planning a celebratory dinner to celebrate her performance (she was told  decisions would be made in a couple of weeks). At this rate, it's  likely she'll be informed that she didn't get the job well before 5 PM.

&amp;#x200B;

I  really don't know what to do or say. If she asks, should I be honest  about this guy's presentation? Should I avoid her the rest of the day? I  want to support her, but have no idea how to even begin talking to her.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

tl;dr Friend applied for a job she has worked towards for two years. She got proverbially destroyed in the interview but has no idea another candidate is going to get it. She's planning to celebrate tonight about her performance in the interview but will probably find out long before that she lost out. How can I support her?"

This is a recent thing, I got a big pay increase by switching jobs, I was making 64k at my previous job, so I was making closer to what Mitch was. We've been together for 3 years and I've had my new job for 6 months.

I didn't think the pay difference was a big deal, were both doing very well for ourselves, especially considering our ages. We live in a small city in the Midwest and the cost of living is so low that those are both very good salaries. But I think my boyfriend has started to resent it, and resent the fact that he thinks he's working harder than me and making less. 

I am able to go home promptly at 5 pm every day and my boyfriend often can't. I also am pretty confident at what I do so there's not a lot of work stress day to day at my job. But my boyfriend is often stressed about new tasks coming up, and when we've gotten to talking about it, he'll make passive agressive comments about how I don't work as hard, and I still get paid more. 

We also had a disagreement about a vacation we're taking together. We were booking flights and we'd previously agreed to split everything half and half, and keep the total cost under a certain number. I realized that the only flights that fit our budget had 2 layovers and would eat into our vacation time a lot, so I suggested we buy the direct flights and I'd cover the part that went over budget. 

He said no, he didn't want me paying for that when we'd agreed on half-and-half, and I asked why it was such a big deal, I was just trying to treat us to something nice and save us a lot of time. He didn't really have a reason other than ""that's not what you said before"" and I tried to get him to explain and he couldn't. So we decided to put off getting plane tickets, I hadn't wanted to spend a lot of time on layovers (it would eat away a day and a half of our vacation time, assuming everything was on schedule... And flights with several layovers rarely are) And he hadn't wanted me to spend more than half.

After that disagreement he said something about me working a very easy job and then just throwing money around, which upset me because I try to be very responsible financially. And my job isn't nothing, either. It's doable but it's not super easy!

tldr My boyfriend seems to resent that I'm making more money.

"Mom trying to cancel grandfather's honor flight because its the day before an athletic event. Not sure what to do.


My aunt (59F) asked my mom (56F) to take her veteran dad on an honor flight without telling her when it was exactly. She said it would be either in April or September and on a Saturday. My mom agreed. 

Note: An honor flight is when veterans take a day trip to DC and tour the monuments and are interviewed by historians. 

Now it's been scheduled for April 27 and my mom says she's busy. She has an athletic event the next day and says that the honor flight with her dad will give her too much anxiety and fatigue to perform well at the race. She asked my aunt to go instead but my aunt will be out of town. She asked my mom because she knew she might be on her trip at that time. 

My whole family feels that my mom should choose her dad. My mom says it's not fair because she didn't know the date when she agreed to do it. She freaks out when people say she should go and blames my aunt for tricking her.  

My mom is not a professional athlete. It's a recreation activity for her. My aunt's vacation is to visit family in Virginia who will soon move to Russia for work.

I (24F) volunteered to take my grandfather because he's super excited about it and he's 95. If he has to reschedule, he may not be well enough or may pass away. Also, his brother (93M)  will be going on the flight as well. 

Unfortunately the flight manifest can't be changed to me so it comes down to my mom. She suggested me taking her ID and impersonating her which I rejected immediately. There's no way I'm going commit fraud and I'm a bit mad she even asked. She then told me that she'll just pull out and Grampa won't go. 

My whole family will be very disappointed if she doesn't go. I will be disappointed. How can I make her see that backing out is selfish and that nobody sees it her way.

TL;DR   My mom is going to cancel my grandfather's honor flight because it's the day before one of her athletic events. The family thinks she is selfish and I do to. How can I convince her to go?"
"I want to be married before purchasing a house with my boyfriend - is this unreasonable?


Hi all, I guess I'll get straight into it. TL;DR at the bottom.


My boyfriend (22M) and I (23F) have been together for a little over two years, and live together. I love him so much and we've had a truly wonderful relationship. Our journey hasn't been without its hard moments, but we've always come out on top of our struggles.


One of the biggest problem-causers in our relationship has been money. I have been blessed with the opportunity to go to college and graduate with only 12k in student loans. I have four part time jobs that pay very well and get excellent benefits, and, at 23 years old, I have paid off my loans, am free of debt, my personal income is higher than the median household income in my area. On the other hand, my boyfriend was raised by a single mother who worked part time in fast food, never went to college, and has two part time entry level jobs.


So, I take care of all necessary expenses, and understandably so. This sometimes bothers me but for the most part I'm okay with it.


For some time now, I have been looking at small houses in my area to purchase - for the equity, to avoid the nuances of renting, and other reasons. We looked at some houses together and several things became clear. First, his budget and expectations (for sq ft, acreage, and ammenities) for a house are much higher than mine, even though he wouldn't be helping me make payments on it. Second, I would be using only my income for all expenses, except some maintenance (as he is quite handy and I am not). Third, he's expecting both of our names to be on the title.


In light of this, and since our relationship is going very well, I brought up marriage to him, and we can hardly talk about the issue without arguing. He has come up with quite a few reasons to not get married - he isn't sure he wants to, and he's concerned that I want to get married just to have a wedding and get some attention for a while (and I've never really fantasized about a dream wedding or even talked about what our wedding would be like, but whatever). He also expressed frustration that my parents would not be paying for our wedding, and will bring up things that we fought about more than a year ago as reasons to not get married.


So, he just doesn't want to. That's fine. But I feel like I am being asked to take a HUGE financial risk for someone who isn't (and doesn't want to be) my husband. So I've decided to briefly stop looking at homes, although I still look at foreclosure listings now and then. But he still brings up purchasing a home often and will show me listings. He is also still in contact with the real estate agent we were working with and they share information about different properties with each other. When I told him I was more passively looking for a house, he told me to ""shit or get off the pot.""


I don't have a clue how to proceed from here as I completely don't understand his perspective. If he wants to buy a house together but not get married, where does he see this relationship going? What could I say to him that would help him share his perspective without striking a nerve and starting an argument? Have any of you ever bought a home with a partner you weren't married to?


TL;DR: My boyfriend wants to share equity on a house that only I am taking out a mortgage for. And he doesn't want to get married. I don't understand what he wants out of our relationship, or how to have a conversation about it.


Thanks in advance for any advice or input."
"I [31f] found out that my bf [39m] of 3 years haven't divorced his ex


So, my boyfriend and I know each other for 4 years. We started dating about 2 years ago, after I broke up with my ex. We live together for 1 years. He's great guy and I've never been so much in love. Since we started dating, I've met his friends, parents, and daughter (11 y.o) and he introduced me as his girlfriend. Everything was fine until now.

Yesterday he was at work and I had a day-off. He forgot some papers and texted me asking to find them inside his desk drawer and send him a copy. Well, while looking for the papers he asked for, I've accidentally found another one dated this February, and it is definitely states that he still married another woman.

I knew he had been married but actually I thought he is divorced for at least 8 years. He lived separately from his wife since 2010, he never mentioned her. A few months ago his parents asked if we are going to marry.

I feel just lost. I don't know how to react. Should I talk to him about it? How?

TLDR; I found out that my bf of 2 years who lives with me haven't divorced his ex. What should I do?"
"I (39f) discovered my husband (39m) cheating on me with my cousin and I'm not handling it well at all.


Since the fall, we've had ""issues"" about her.  I assumed they were pretty much just me reacting with a bit of secret jealousy. She is gorgeous and just moved back to our area. They hit it off and we all hung out a few times. But they seemed almost ""touchy feely"". When I saw they were chatting on text, I started getting upset with him. I asked him to back off with her.  She's come up a few more times over the months, but he assures me he never texts her anymore and I was being paranoid and had nothing to be jealous about in the first place.

&amp;#x200B;

I honestly did think I was just being overly sensitive, and she wasn't even on my radar.  We were gearing up for Christmas and going on a little family vacation. Had a wonderful New Year's Eve. All of January and February were wonderful.  Then the horrible truth. My cousin's boyfriend sent me screenshots. They were having an affair. 

&amp;#x200B;

All the time. He was skipping work to go have sex with her (in her boyfriend's bed while he was at work).  He was buying her things. In fact I saw a couple of those things in December hidden away in our room and thought they were for me. I didn't get them at Christmas, and I was confused but thought maybe it was for my birthday instead.  Nope, it was for her.  A few times I'd bring up something about her and he always pretended he could barely remember much about her (struggled to recall her last name, which is different from mine).  ""Oh, she's blonde? I thought she had darker hair"".  ""Oh, she is still in the area? Wasn't she leaving at some point to move back to \_\_\_\_\_?""  Just stupid things that were obviously meant to throw me off.

&amp;#x200B;

Anyway, now: the aftermath. She has cut ties with him because he was also basically lying to her about me (and she wants to stay with her boyfriend who miraculously is willing to try again with her).  But I'm seeing red hot anger. My life has been destroyed. He lied to me for months, and put my health at risk (having sex with both of us unprotected).  The pain and rage I feel is all consuming. I want to destroy him.

&amp;#x200B;

But I also don't want to go to jail.  How do I channel this pain and anger? What can I do? I can't eat or sleep. I cry, but they are tears of pure rage. I can't believe another human could be so cruel to their best friend.  I need to get past this or it will kill me.  Also how the hell would I ever ever ever trust again? Am I just destined to be single forever now?  What's worse is my cousin's boyfriend (who hadn't met me previously) met up with me and in his grief stricken fog, said to me ""well I can see physically why he did it. She's much hotter"".

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

**tldr:  husband lied and cheated with my cousin for months and now I feel rage but I don't know how to channel it.**

"My (21, F) Mother (42, F) staged my dog being missing when he wasn't. How to move forward after this betrayal?


Hi everyone,

Bit of background information: I got my dog Oscar (Cavalier King Charles Spaniel) for my 13th Birthday. I lived in my mother's house with Oscar and my 3 siblings up until I was 19 and moved out to attend university. Unfortunately as I moved into university accommodation I could not bring Oscar with me, despite desperately wanting to. I couldn't afford anything more expensive and to be honest, the dorms at uni have proved a struggle, with me working two part time jobs to cover the rent/utilities and cost of living. Oscar is an expensive dog due to his heart condition (diagnosed 4 years ago) and he needs daily medication (Vetmedin) which i have paid for since he has needed it, and still send my mother money monthly to purchase his medication. My mother didn't seem happy about looking after Oscar in my absence (i try to come back every weekend to see him) but begrugingly agreed to look after him as I couldn't bare to rehome him (I'd genuinely rather not go to uni than do this). Apart from a daily walk (30 mins) which my mother does anyway for her two labradors, and giving him his tablets twice daily, Oscar is low-maintainence and not that difficult to take care of. I have had a difficult upbringing at the hands of my mother (Social Service involved all through my childhood) and Oscar has been the only constant in my life and has very much got me through the harder times, hence my attachment to him. I ring my mother pretty much daily asking how the family is, including Oscar. She tells me he is perfectly fine. 

Well I got a call on Friday afternoon off my mother, frantically telling me that she had accidently ""left the back gate open"" and that Oscar was missing. I immediately left class and made the 2 hour drive home, in tears the entire time and started searching for him, all through the night. I didn't get back to my mother's house until Saturday evening. I broke down in her arms sobbing hysterically at the thought of never seeing Oscar again. Over the weekend, I made a page on Facebook, contacted the local vets and police department and made posters of Oscar and put them all around my town. From Saturday evening to Tuesday night i stayed at my mother's house, calling in sick to university and work and devoted all my time to finding Oscar. As you can imagine, I have hardly been eating or sleeping due to the stress and I have honestly felt like I have been on autopilot these last few days, this has utterly ruined me emotionally. 

Well, the facebook page I created to spread information about Oscar created quite a lot of traction, the posts became viral and were having upwards of 12,000 shares (probably to do with my pitiful paragraphs begging and pleading for information). Oscar was even mentioned on the local radio this morning. I had people stopping me in the street on my searches telling me they knew all about him and people arranging search parties of over 100 people, looking for him off their own accord. The more people who knew about Oscar, the more nervous my mother became. She started acting strange and almost pleading with me to ""go back home to uni"" and that she will ""continue the search"". 

I get home this afternoon after 5 hours of searching the local parks and get a phonecall from one of my mother's old friends (my mobile number was on the many, many posters I had put up all around town). She told me she had information about Oscar and that she wanted to meet me. I met her 15 minutes later at the local park and ***she had Oscar!!!*** she immediately broke down into tears and told me that my mother had contacted her on Sunday morning offering her money to look after Oscar for her ""for a few days"". According to my mother's friend (who has no reason to lie), my mother's plan was for me to be so distraught at never seeing him again, I take him off her hands as soon as he is 'found'. My mother's friend said she really needed the money and had no idea that I would be so devastated. She gave him back immediately and apologised profusely. 

I contacted my mother to tell her to never contact me again and Oscar is now with me in my dorm room at university. I have been shaking the past 8 hours and cannot believe my own mother would betray me like this. She knows how much he means to me. Obviously I cannot keep Oscar here permanently so I am going to have to figure out another way. Rehoming him ***isn't*** an option so I may have to drop out of university if needs be and come back in a few years. 

I suppose my question is, how do I go forward in regards to my mother? I am so angry right now and it took all my strength to drive back to uni and not go back to her house as I would have punched her. 

Thank you for reading. Any advice is very much appreciated.

TL;DR- Left dog with mother whilst attending university. Mother told me dog was missing because I guess she didn't want to look after him anymore rather than telling me she didn't want him so I could figure out an alternative.

"Me [40 M] with my wife [38 F] of 19 years, progressing from dead-bedroom status but host of issues.


So I should give a little context.

&amp;#x200B;

\* We have two kids.  Aged 13 (boy) and 10 (girl)

\* A little over 6 years ago she went a massive depressive period.  Very hard for me as I often sacrifice my own needs to meet the needs of others.  Harder for her.

\* We were both born, raised, and married Mormon, which has a massive effect on one's worldview.  Becoming aware of the harm of the religion I left it around 3.5 years ago.  Were our roles reversed I would absolutely consider this a betrayal so I can understand her perspective here.  She had considered it a betrayal but it just now starting to see that I am a good man.

\* I had made some promises around alcohol and our children (Mormons abstain from alcohol).  I had thought this was to be discreet; but she had thought it meant to not have it in the house.  My small wine stash was discovered and this was considered another betrayal on my part.

\* At some point she had built up enough emotion issues around our dog that she act unilaterally and got rid of him one day.  This absolutely floored me.  I spent 6 hours aimlessly driving and wandering through stores touching things.  It took me days to come back to myself.  I remember at the time thinking that I couldn't conceive of how cheating/adultery could be considered worse.

\* We started relationship counselling around 6 months ago.  She is very emotional, and repetitive; and I don't deal well with either emotion or repetition.  So she would outsource her issues to her girlfriends.  This was a tolerable, but not ideal arrangement.  Around 2 months ago she started having anxiety and depression issues again.  Strangely enough this lead to some significant break-through in our relationship as she started ... to see me as an equal.

\* Last week she confessed to ""cheating"".  Not quite to the point of sex; but she has been romantically involved with 2 other men.  I immediately felt like this should ""mean something""; but try as I could to reach the emotion I got nothing.  This scares me.  Is it that this hurts so much that I just can't touch it?  Or am I so burnt out that I just don't really care anymore?  Did I program myself for this reaction with my thoughts around the what happened when she got rid of the dog?

\* Her anxiety and depression are significantly increasing.  Now I connect this to her guilt and Mormon upbringing around the cheating.

\* She is cutting herself and having suicidal thoughts; but doesn't have a plan.  She is seeing professionals in regards to this.  Her medication dosage has been increased.

\* I had previously thought the cheating had been ""in the past"".  Certainly before we starting counselling.  But have recently discovered that it continued until about a month ago.  I still don't 'feel' it; but this seems like it should matter.

&amp;#x200B;

So it's a mess.  If she was a new girl I'd be running 1000+ miles away; but she's my wife of nearly two decades and mother to my children.

&amp;#x200B;

The specific question: What can I do to make this work ... without compromising myself?

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR: Relationship progressing from dead bedroom status, lots of valid reasons on all sides.  She cheated.  She's very vulnerable.  I don't know if I can go through this again.  I don't even know what I 'feel'."
"Me (27M) and my wife (27F) are newlyweds having extreme intimacy issues...


My wife and I were married this past year after dating for approximately 7 years beforehand. We love each other very much and are happily married except for one aspect:  sex.

As some background: we were both brought up with the belief that sex was reserved for marriage, which we both followed. We were sexually active with one another before we were married, but short of actual intercourse. 

In those days, we were very sexually attracted to one another, and we both assumed that those feelings would continue into marriage... but that wasn't true. 

The issue is that since our wedding night, my wife has just not been feeling it. Obviously, our first time was awkward for both of us, and painful for her, but we enjoyed the first couple times actually having sex. Shortly after, though, we haven't been able to both be in the mood at the same time. If we are, things just aren't great for both of us.

Now, I definitely have a higher sex drive with her, but even when we do have sex, she has said that she just really isn't into it... Which makes things less exciting or satisfying for the both of us.

We know it's a problem, and we just had our first appointment with a therapist this week, but after meeting with the therapist and doing some follow up discussions with one another, we both have become very aware that my wife is just plain old not into sex right now.

At this point, guilt and fear is starting to set in for me... It feels like this is just the beginning of many long years without enjoyable sex. I'm not sure what to think right now, and I'm curious is anyone else has had an experience like this. Is my situation dire for the time being? What should I/we do?

TL;DR: We saved sex for marriage, are happy newlyweds, but my wife seems to not be interested in sex... Ever. We're seeing a therapist now, but things look dire. What do I\we do?"
"Is it wrong of me (24F) to demand that my boyfriend (25M) pay back the $3000 he owes me, by the date he said he’d have it paid back...even though I’m certain he’s not going to even have it?


I’m really unable to tell if I’m being too lenient or too harsh here. I’m going to keep it short and sweet, so hopefully the details are clear enough. 

My boyfriend and I are from different countries, and I’ve been living and working in his country for a couple of years. I have a steady online job. He’s recently tried to get into a new field, and while he was looking for a job (around 3 months) I paid for both of our expenses. I’ve kept a log of everything I paid for, and he has every intention of paying it back. When he finally got a job, he did start to pay me back (around $1000) but then he got fired from his job for making a serious mistake. Around 3 more months passed (through the holidays, no one was hiring in his industry) and I continued to pay for him. He got a new job a month and a half ago, but he’s been put on as a casual worker and the company will often cancel his shifts at the last minute. He’s paid me back around $500 now, and he still owes me around $3000. 

The problem is, I’m going to be leaving his country in two months. I plan to travel with my sister and take a short break from working. He has told me many times, very confidently, that he WILL have his debt repaid by the time I leave. I need the money for the things I want to do while I’m away. But at this point, it seems close to impossible that he’ll be able to pay much of it back. I’m not sure whether letting it slide would be me being a pushover, or whether saying “find the money” is just me being mean. 

TL;DR boyfriend owes me money, said he’d pay it back by an approaching deadline, but it’s looking more and more unlikely that he’ll even have it. Should I force it, or lose out on things I want to spend it on for myself?"
"BF (34M) doesn’t want to do the trip he promised me as a birthday gift, I (F26) understand but am sick of the way he again handled a problem


I’ve got nobody to talk to and I really need to get some perspective because I feel like I’m going crazy.  We have been dating for almost four years, living together for most of the time. 

My birthday was last month and a few weeks before it, BF said that as a birthday present, he would buy fly tickets to a City I’ve always wanted to visit and we would spend our summer holiday there. First, I said no, because I felt it was a bit too much for a birthday present. We’re not broken, but we could use some savings.  But as my birthday was approaching, he kept talking about it, painting the picture of the two of us visiting the City, eating local food, sightseeing in the City and saying how much I’ll love it, I accepted and started looking forward to it. He said he doesn’t care how much it would cost and he can’t wait to make me happy. 

Around a week ago, he said it is time for us to book the tickets. I sat down and the cheapest direct ones I found were a bit more expensive than we anticipated. He agreed and I spent a few more days googling and trying to find a cheaper way - I managed to find tickets which were about two thirds of the price, but we would have to stay in a different town (and country) on our way there and back. I didn’t think of it much, because it was still cheaper and it is a place I would like to once visit anyway. 

During this research, BF starting hinting we shouldn’t go, “joking” that it is going to ruin him and that we’ll have no money left. That is not true and I was ready to share the expenses, I never expected him to pay for the whole trip himself. Anyway, when I asked whether he has any doubts, he denied it and said again we would go. Tonight I finally wanted to book the tickets, since they won’t get any cheaper. He was more and more hesitating, so I confronted him. I told him we don’t have to go, I realise that it is not cheap, but he shouldn’t have spent the last month promising and reassuring me that we would go.

Long story short, it blew up. He said he never wanted to go there anyway, why would I ever thought he wanted to visit the City and how we always only do things for me. I had no idea he felt this way. I know he has different places on his bucket list, but they’re on different continents and therefore even more expensive.  He likes travelling and exploring and I try to make him happy as much as I can every day. 

Now I’m feeling disappointed and annoyed how much time I’ve put into this. Again, I understand the financial side, but I wish he had been more direct with me. Either do more research before promising a gift like this or tell me right after he found out. Importantly, this is not the first time he avoided communicating what he wanted and blew it up later anyway.  

Am I in the wrong feeling the way I do? I feel like a gold digger and don’t know what to do now. I want to forget the whole thing but I also want BF expressing his opinions better.

TLDR: BF promised flight tickets to my dream City, when he found out they were more expensive than he thought, he didn’t say anything until I confronted him. Instead he kept telling me how great the trip is going to be. I
would have preferred if he had just told me instead of making false promises for 4+ weeks. I never expected him to pay for the whole thing himself. Half of our fights happen because he doesn’t communicate his wants. "
"I (f24) found my mother(f 51) crying to herself in a dark room over marital issues. What can I say or do to help her feel better?


I live with my parents at the moment who are having a lot of issues. I caught her crying in a dark room by herself and immediately became worried. My parents have had issues specifically with abuse thanks to my father my whole life, but this was something different and for the first time she has discussed leaving him, which honestly I don't think she actually will just because she is still very financially dependent on him-her job doesn't make her much money. After I found her I consoled her, and talked/listened but I don't know what else I can do to help. I'm desperate and feel awful for her. Seeing my mother cry like that was one of the worst feelings ever :(

"Roommate regularly steals my food. Boyfriend and I are arguing about how I handled the most recent situation.


My [25F] boyfriend [28M] and I live with his childhood best friend [26M]. My boyfriend and I have been together three years, we’ve been living in this situation for the past 1.5 years.

My roommate has a drinking problem (like drinks a half pint of whiskey a day) and consistently eats my food without asking. He claims he eats at night and doesn’t remember, but I’ve caught him helping himself to my food plenty of times in broad daylight. 

I started off nice by saying I’m happy to share if he asks. The stealing continued so I got less nice about it. When I’d catch him, I’d tell him he needed to replace the item. Other times I was too annoyed to bother bringing it up. I’ve talked to him about his food stealing in general on multiple occasions. I told him that it’s rude and disrespectful and that just because I offer him something now and again doesn’t give him free reign over the pantry.

We’ve offered to have him come grocery shopping with us, but it never happens. He prefers to spend his cash on beer and fast food. 

Today, I noticed that he had opened a new pack of my health foods brand hotdogs, not the cheap kind, and had eaten 4 of the 6 in the pack. I texted him that he needed to buy me a new pack.

Later on, my bf and I were leaving to the grocery store. He said he could come with and buy stuff or send money. I was feeling/acting annoyed and said he could do whichever. He said he would just send $20, and I said fine.

When my bf heard, he told me it wasn’t right to accept more than the replacement amount for the hotdogs. I argued that roommate steals my food all the time and doesn’t replace it. To me it seems like the least he could do. My boyfriend still thinks I’m taking advantage of the situation.

Am I being unreasonable, or is it justifiable to accept more the money?


TLDR; I live with my bf and his childhood friend, Joe. Joe continues to steal my food. I’ve talked to him about it in person a million times. He’ll replace things only when I call him out. Otherwise he thinks I don’t notice. Joe opened a new pack of my hotdogs and ate 4 of the 6. Only when I called him out did he offer to replace them. When joe saw that bf and I were going to the store, he said he could just send $20 over. I said fine. I felt justified bc this happens all the time and he often doesn’t replace things. Bf thinks it’s unreasonable of me to accept more money than the hotdogs were worth. 

Am I being unreasonable or am I justified?

"My (37M) partner (31F) is so unstable I don't know if I can do it anymore


Hi all,

Like the title says, my partner of two years creates what I feel is an ongoing rollercoaster of emotions and situations. Some days she can be the sweetest most loving partner and others she will call the relationship off and go so far as to block me on social media. These type of swings are usually every two weeks.

The main recent reason is centred around marriage. On her good days she will propose, sometimes multiple times a day. I feel the relationship is too unstable and have always replied with a similar answer of ""show me you can be stable for a month and we will"". She then takes this extremely hard and begins her next downward spiral.

Previous to the marriage reason it was exactly the same rollercoaster based on things such as Facebook profile photos, moving in together etc.

She has been diagnosed as depressed but can't be bothered to take the tablets even so far as to admit while on them she feels better.

Furthermore in an effort to maintain appearances she has admitted to lying to family friends about me being unfaithful and preparing a story for why we will be breaking up in advance of the next swing. When confronted it was lie, lie and lie some more until everyone involved was in the same room and the truth came out. 
This sort of thing continues up until as recently as this week where my sister told me the things she was saying about me were terrible and to be aware that if they were said to others who didn't know me personally could affect things such as my career. My partner denied this and exclaimed everything said was positive..

She has a terrible trait of flirting with everyone! We have discussed this and I try my best not to get upset but she has recently been offered a management position of a bar which involves a lot of bar tending. While again she has called the relationship off this week she is now highlighting the comments and pick up attempts at the bar and I'm worried it might get out of hand and become an act that we can't reconcile.

My question is should I keep trying? It's been good just to type this out but I feel clouded.


TL;DR  My partner continually calls the relationship on/off. She has the potential to be great but also to be terrible and I'm not sure what to do."
"My [22F] best friend [22F] is avoiding me after we hooked up


Throwaway

I’m  bisexual and I came out to my best friend last year. We went to school  in a pretty liberal city, but I still wasn’t ready to tell people so she  was the only person who knew for a while.

This  made us even closer. She was super supportive and would take me to gay  bars and ask me if I thought a girl was cute. I had a big crush on a  classmate of ours and she was the only person I could talk to about it.

Then,  last summer after we graduated she cane over to my place to check out  my new apartment. We started drinking and she thought it would be funny  if we made out. I said it was a bad idea at first but eventually I went  along with it. Things escalated and she ended up fingering me.

After  that I realized I may have feelings for her. I thought our relationship  would either go to the next level or we would laugh it off and stay  friends, but after she left my place she never spoke to me again.  We  have a lot of mutual friends, and she told them all what happened and  now they’re all really weird and awkward around me. Some have even made  gay jokes. At one party I was at someone got drunk and asked me why I  haven’t come out yet in front of everyone. 

It’s  been eight months. I’ve tried reaching out and she still won’t talk to  me. At one point when I tried contacting her she had a friend of ours  write me back on her phone telling me to “stop harassing her”. She just  had a birthday party and invited all of our friends and didn’t invite  me. 

I  feel so fucking isolated and lonely. I miss my friend so much. I feel  like everywhere I go everyone knows what happened to me and they think  I’m pathetic or a stalker or a lesbian. I feel like everything is  spiraling out of control. I can’t remember ever feeling so depressed and  hurt. I’m in so much pain and I don’t know how to make it better. What  should I do?

Tl;dr:  my friend and I slept together. We are both girls and I was in the  closet. Now my friend won’t talk to me and all our friends know and they  treat it like a joke. I don’t know how to navigate this."
"I (23F) just discovered the real cost of my wedding ring. My issue is not the cost, but the elaborate lie my husband (29M) has been telling me, my friends, and family.


Me and my husband have been married for almost nine months, been together for a little over 2 years and have known each other since I was 18. We have had our fair share of  issues but nothing truly detrimental to our relationship. We have the same values, both try to be as open as possible and are loyal to each other each and every day.

&amp;#x200B;

So, a little back story to how I discovered the cost of my ring. When me and my husband first started dating I had used his email to forward him or myself something, I can't remember exactly since it was so long ago. I noticed he had a bunch of emails he had sent to himself with the subject line as his sons name. I shouldn't have opened his personal emails but curiosity got the best of me. I really wasn't trying to snoop or catch him doing anything wrong, I just noticed my step-son's name and was curious. It was a bunch of really precious old photos of him, it looked like he was trying to save them off an old phone by forwarding them to his email. In the midst of all the photos were several selfies of his ex in bras or in the car or just being cute. The emails were from before we started dating so I asked my husband if he could please delete any photos that he had of her. He said sure and deleted them and I 100% believed him. He also said he deleted any pictures of her from his photo gallery on his Mac. Well, a just few weeks ago he synced his iCloud up to his phone for the first time and a lot of pictures of her showed up in his photo album. He said he wasn't sure how that happened (and I believed him because the Cloud fucking confuses me) and he immediately deleted them. 

&amp;#x200B;

Now, heres where I fucked up. I got onto his computer last night because its in our room and I didn't want to get up to go to the office computer and I noticed his email was left log in. This really small, awful, jealous part of me told me to look through the old images on his email to see if the pictures of her were really gone. When I realized they were deleted I was relieved but also felt guilty. But I just kept looking. I should've stopped. My husband has truly never done anything to make me doubt him but I was home alone and feeling insecure about the photo thing and started being nosy. The first  thing I went to was his account and I noticed there was a tab for Payments and Subscriptions and, god damnit, I just clicked it. They were all little silly purchases like pizza and movies. But then I saw a purchase from about a month before we got married last year and my heart sank. It was a purchase from eBay with the title ""14K White Gold Finish 2 Carat Enhanced Diamond..."" Etc. Etc. for $89.00.

&amp;#x200B;

My husband surprised me with this ring about a week before we got married. It's beautiful, its shiny, and its huge. He told me it was a Tiffany and ""Tiffany and Co."" is even etched right inside of it. He refused to tell me what it cost. The ring I wore through out our engagement was a very dainty, inexpensive ring from Etsy that I absolutely ADORED, so this new ring was jaw dropping to say the least. (Also, we still kept our money separate at this point. We agreed to combine our finances after we got married. We were living rent free with his Dad for about 6 months so we could save up for the wedding and a nicer place. He got a job for a weapons manufacturing company and was making about 3x an hour more than me. My husband was never stingy with his money and provided our family with whatever we wanted or need. I mainly used my income for my car payment and savings for the wedding.) 

&amp;#x200B;

He showed that ring off to my whole family, his whole family, really anyone that congratulated us. At our wedding it was the only thing anyone was talking about. He got drunk and bragged to my best friend about ""how much it cost"" and how he secretly had been saving up for it for months and even had to finance it for a while without me ever knowing. Everyone was impressed and I was actually really proud of him. I didn't care so much about the materialistic side of it but seeing my husband finally have a great job and being proud of the things he could give his family made me so happy. 

&amp;#x200B;

My best friend asked me if I wanted to know how much it cost. I told her I didn't want to know. She said she respected that but if she were me she ""wouldn't even risk wearing it and would keep it tucked away except for special occasions""  I told my husband about it and he was beaming. He said ""Lets just say, your car loan isn't much more expensive than that ring."" HOLY SHIT. My car loan is a THIRTEEN GRAND meaning this ring is the nicest thing Ive ever owned. I even caught MYSELF telling people who would comment on it how my ring was a Tiffany! and how my dear husband surprised me with it! 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

And now, I am embarrassed. It's a $90 ring off eBay, which I confirmed by copy and pasting the purchase description directly into the search bar on eBay. There it was. Same exact ring. Im not at all embarrassed at the price of the ring or the way it looks, just embarrassed that my husband has been lying to people and so have I.  I can't talk to anyone about this because I know they will judge him and he would be SO embarrassed. So, I just don't know what to do. I've thought about it and I think my only options are:

&amp;#x200B;

A) Confront him with my evidence, tell him I know the truth and ask him to explain his reasoning. This is the most uncomfortable option.

&amp;#x200B;

B) Casually ask him if he has the Tiffany papers that confirm its authentic or tell him that I want the Tiffany Blue Box to keep with our wedding stuff or something like that. Basically, corner him into admitting it.

&amp;#x200B;

or C) Say nothing. Keep the ring put away because of it's ""price"" and never brag about it again. I would wear my engagement ring instead. Its darling anyways and I'm proud of it even if it is a $30 ring from Etsy! Its pretty and has a lot of sentimental value to me. 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

UGH. I just don't know what to do and need advice. Also, why would he lie? How could he keep up such a lie??? Should I doubt his honesty about everything now? Sorry for this being so long, but it has really been eating me up inside.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR; Discovered that the ""designer"" ring my husband has been gloating about for the entirety of out 9 month marriage is really a knock off he got off eBay for $89. My issue is not the price, but the fact that he has been lying straight to my face and our family and friends. Now, I don't know what to think or if i should trust him. I also don't know how I should handle the situation. The whole thing is extremely... cringey."
"Wife's [30/F] family's visits are excruciating and exhausting and last FOR MONTHS. I [30/M] can't get through to her.


My wife and I live in the US and love our lives (mostly). My wife was born and raised in Europe and we met while studying together. We did the LDR thing and then with a lot of paperwork and tears, she got papers to live here. It's been fantastic. 

My wife has some baggage - both her parents. They're okay people who are just an incredible pain in the ass. They're the kind of people who feel the absolute need to tell you why life is so much better in their shoebox-sized apartment in a city they cannot afford and how we're a bunch of luddites in pick-up trucks. They love to harp on being European as some sort of ""bonus points"". My in-laws are mostly destitute - they've retired and draw a public pension but are always in hock to someone - credit card companies, debt collectors, private loans, etc. They generally have no more than a couple of hundred dollars and no assets. They routinely travel here with no traveler's insurance or emergency funds, often less than €500 for a three month trip. If we offer to pay or provide them some spending cash, we're ""rich Americans"" (we're not) flaunting our wealth in their face. 

Their visits can last anywhere from 2-3 months (on average) to a whopping 5 months (in the most recent case). Our kids [3 1/2 M] and [1/F] don't enjoy time with their grandparents - it's often them trying to cajole the oldest to speak French and pushing him until he starts to cry - our son is very verbal and a quick witted kid but he's not confident in French and his European grandparents are exceptionally pushy. My in-law's feelings get hurt when the kid defaults to English and will often sulk when he elects to watch an American TV show over this idiotic ""L'an tro tro"" they keep trying to force on him. 

My in-laws are broke and annoying and sit around the house all day. They don't generally go out and ""see the sights"". They will sit in front of a fan and complain all day. They think I'm slighting them since I don't take the full time off when they're here (I mean, come on...). They sulk. About everything. They complain that it's either way too hot or way, way too hot and that while the steak is cheaper than they're used to paying, they don't want it ""because it's not the same shape as they're used to."" There is absolutely no limit to how much they can complain and about what they can complain. They complain when it rains and when it's sunny. It's incessant. 

They've recently left after a mind numbing 5 months (and by recent, I mean, I dropped them off at the airport not two hours ago). This is it. There's no more 5 month trip. There's no more two months. My wife is always in agreement - no smoking in the house, shorter trips, traveler's insurance and they need to find something to do - she gets all jazzed up and then.... never says anything. 

I got home and my 3 1/2 year old looked at me and said ""are gamma and grandpa gone?"" And when I said yes, he said ""thank you."" As a point of comparison, when my parents come to visit, our son throws himself in every direction when they leave and sat by the door waiting for them to return. 

My In-laws said they'd ""be back"" and my wife said okay. When I reminded her that we need to talk to them about boundaries, she was again all hepped up to talk to them, but I know she won't. 

I need to strategize about how to take control of this and I'm at my wit's end. I cannot stand to even think about them coming again and need at least a year. My wife generally doesn't travel home much and when we do, my SIL and her family immediately flee the area to get away from her parents so we get no respite. I still haven't seen much of the city. 

tl;dr in-laws come to the US for months and are difficult, pushy, rude, annoying and destitute. They act terribly and my wife won't put a stop to them. Need advice on dealing with this before they return again.

"I [25F] lost my dad a few years ago in an accident and I was there and saw it all, my cousin [29F] constantly posts pictures of him online and acts like he was her dad and I hate her for it


My cousin has been my best friend my whole life. She was more than that, she's family but like a true sister. First of all, we had a complicated ""situation"" growing up. We lived 10 minutes away from each other, and would see each other everyday. When I was in middle school, she would pick me up from school with her boyfriend and we would hang out. Her dad died before she was born, and the only father figure in her life was in fact my dad and another uncle. 

I'm don't wanna get into the accident, just that I was the one who saw/held/spoke to and was with my dad. I saw the paramedics try, and give up and call it. It's been haunting me since I was 17 years old. It's basically fucked up my whole life. I've never posted a picture of him on social media. I've never talked about him. I don't want the world to pity me, or think I'm still not over it (even though I'm clearly not over it). She on the other hand, constantly posts about him. I showed her family videos (of just OUR family, like me with him) and she somehow stole that video (or recorded it with her phone) just the part he's in and posted it and everyone is commenting on her post like ""omg so sad"" ""he was a great man"" ""you must miss him"". I fucking hate her for doing this. 

I realize that I'm being extremely immature, and he was her uncle and that he would be beyond disappointed in me for feeling this way. I don't know how to come to terms with this. She has every right to miss her uncle, who was the only father figure she's had. She is right to miss him, because he was a superhero. I am not jealous of the ""attention"" she's getting when she posts these things. I tried posting about him once, and I took it down within a few hours. I just don't feel comfortable. It's like my dad is this treasure that only I have in this world, and I'm not sharing with anyone else. 

I'm angry at myself for having these feelings, I'm angry at her for posting about him, I'm angry at the comments... and I don't want to be angry anymore. I have been very cold to her lately, sort of starting to resent her and I had to stop myself from commenting on her pictures a few times. I legit wanted to post ""STOP USING MY DAD TO GET PEOPLE TO FEEL SORRY FOR U"". 

How do I stop being like this? I also really don't want her to know that I have these thoughts/feelings because... in a weird way, I don't want her to know that I'm this weak and I don't want to disappoint her either. I have made comments before, this is not a new thing. It's been going on since it happened. She was once crying to me and we were alone and she said she was broken, and I said ""how do you think I feel? I was there! my dad!"" but I've never actually said that it bothers me when she claims her loss is so tragic and horrible. (even though, it is. ) 

TL;DR lost my dad, it damaged me entirely bc I was the one who saw it all. Years later, my cousin's constantly posting his pictures/about him on social media is making me hate her because she's acting like he was her dad and she was in my shoes. "
"I [23M] moved in with my boyfriend [21M] after two-and-a-half years in an LDR. I don't know if I am expecting something unreasonable, but I just don't feel like it's right anymore. Should I stay? How should I bring it up?


Last year around this time we began making plans for me to move overseas from the US to Australia, so that we could start building a life together. It was like a dream come true for some time, traveling to a whole new country with only the things I could carry in two suitcases and a bag. Now I've been here for...six months now and I just can't bring myself to feel anything for us as a couple.  


After arriving here I went straight out to look for a job, so I work from 7am-4pm on weekdays. He was finishing a degree in film at the time, so I was super supportive for him putting his all into getting it done. Often he'd be out until 9 or 10pm working on projects, so I would take care of laundry, cleaning, cooking and other household chores. We did a lot of work together leading up to the final project, which was a major success for him and his team.

&amp;#x200B;

The course ended in January, which is when I feel things began to change. Now that we spend more time together, I notice things that never came up before. He grew up with parents that did everything for him, almost to the point that he doesn't know how to do basic things like properly tying his shoes or washing dishes. If I try to offer advice he gets angry and defensive. It seems as though it happens every other time we interact, and I just don't want to do things together anymore. It's easier and less stressful to do it myself. At this point I feel like I'm keeping up the whole household alone.

&amp;#x200B;

I don't claim innocence though, I feel like there are times when I'm...too critical, or cold. I have had difficulty feeling strong emotions for a while, and I wonder how much it's actually affecting us. I never cared much for sex, and he isn't particularly sexually attractive to me - I was always in it for the relationship. Since I've recently stopped responding to sexual advances, he began to worry that I was cheating. I have tried explaining this to him, but it's still a bit uncomfortable between us. 

&amp;#x200B;

Our current home is a room and a study in a house shared with friends of the family, so we get a slight break on rent. This is offset, however, by the six cats, constant pest problems, and complete lack of privacy outside of our cramped bedroom. I've tried a few times to get us out into a new place so that we could at least keep things cleaner and more private, but we're stretched thin monetarily and we still have to save for my visa application - if we actually go through with it.

&amp;#x200B;

There's so many things that have just been culminating up to this point and I'm starting to fall apart. I love my job here, but even that is killing me lately and I just want to escape, but I feel like I can't. I'm stuck.

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR Long Distance Relationship didn't turn out as I expected. Am I expecting too much or should I get out?"
"UPDATE: My best friend [21/M] is spreading false rumors about me [22/M] and it's affecting how others view me.


Original post: [https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/azwifz/my\_best\_friend\_21m\_is\_spreading\_false\_rumors/](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/azwifz/my_best_friend_21m_is_spreading_false_rumors/)

&amp;#x200B;

Later in the day after that first post, I called everyone into my hotel room and I decided to just clear things out right there with everyone listening. I told them all about why Zack is pissed at me and why he refused to go on this trip. I told them the truth and I even showed them a previous Reddit post that mentioned him sleeping with my ex in my bed. I told them all that he just flipped the script so that I was the bad guy and that these claims of abuse simply aren't true. But unfortunately, out of the whole group, only two of my friends apologized to me and said that they believe me. The others just didn't say anything. They either just cleared the room immediately or just went back to whispering about me and looking at me and shaking their heads. This seriously was enough to ruin the whole trip for me.

The next day was out flight back home and while we were waiting for our rides to the airport, one of my ""friends"" bumped me and said ""Sorry, David O. Russell."" For those who don't know, David O. Russell is a film director who's notoriously abusive towards his actors and crew and that's apparently how most of my ""friends"" now viewed me. We flew home and I had to deal with more of them just whispering and looking at me on the flight and then we all went our separate ways after we got home. I decided to give up on convincing them and I chose to focus on Zack.

I called him yesterday and I asked him to tell my friends that he's lying. But Zack said that he's only willing to do that if I give him the money that he thinks I owe him. He was still demanding $100 for every scene that he had been in from our most recent film. He wanted $900 for the nine scenes that he was in and he said that he'll come clean and clear my name if I give him his money. I told him that I don't have that type of money after the trip, but he just reminded me of the deal and he hung up.

Now I've decided this: Fuck it. Zack can stay mad at me and the rest of my ""friends"" can piss off. I don't know what else there is left to convince them and I'm not going to spend the rest of my life worrying about it. Maybe they'll come around, maybe Zack will have a change of heart, (least likely scenario) or maybe Zack will be exposed in some way. Whatever happens, I'm done worrying about it. There's nothing left that I can do other than just move on.

&amp;#x200B;

tldr: Told my friends the truth, most of them didn't believe me. Zack still wants his money and I'm left with no other options than to just move on."
"My (24M) GF (25F) pretended to break up with me as a ""Wake up call""


It all started when we both hopped in my car to drive to grab some dinner. She had her phone plugged into my car to play music, but my car also reads your text messages out loud. She suddenly received a text message from a guy that was new to me and never mentioned anything about. We've been together long enough that we each know who our friends and co-workers are. Either way, that's not the problem, as she doesn't need to report back to me prior to gaining new friends.

 The problem was my car read the text message outloud and it read ""Your body is a lot hotter than your BitMoji ;)"". She quickly tapped a button on the dashboard that replied ""Sorry, I'm driving"" and he instantly replied ""Oh, Sowwy"". At that point, her phone also unlocked and as I glanced over, that was the first message in the chat log of the conversation with this guy.

I confronted her about it, she stated it was her co-worker, and she did not expect a message like that. She said they exchanged phone numbers a couple days ago for ""Overtime Opportunities"" and that was the first message he ever sent her, and she states she will take care of it at work.

 
I asked her if she can take care of it right now, and she refused, got angry and yelled ""Just drop it"". I asked her if I can see the messages, and she refused, got even more angry and asked to be dropped off on the sidewalk. I pulled over, dropped her off (Which was 2 blocks away from my house) and continued home. As I got home, she called me back, stating she over reacted, asked me to come pick her back up and clarify that nothing is going on.

When I picked her back up, she showed me the messages, and she texted him ""What do you mean?"" And his reply was ""Oh, I did not realize that upsets you, I am sorry, it won't happen again"", all while she was out of my car. I asked her if any messages were deleted, she got upset, walked into the house, packed up her belongings, took the cat and said ""Were done"" and spent the night at one of her girlfriends houses.

Throughout the night, I tried calling her 3 times and she did not pick up, but at the same time I'm seeing Snapchat stories from her partying and drinking with friends. Meanwhile I'm also getting messages from her family stating ""I heard you guys split apart"". 

Fast forward until the morning, I called her again and still didn't pick up. 2 hours later, she called me back and said ""I was angry and frusterated because I don't need you investigating me"". She was not serious about breaking up, but wanted to show it to me as a ""Wake up call"" to what's going to happen if I continue to ""Investigate her"" about this guy.

We had about a two hour conversation on the phone, me expressing my concerns that I don't want to start getting more serious and live in fear that your going to use my love as a weapon and threaten ""walking out on me"" when things don't go your way or want to communicate. She agrees, apologises and stated she acted out of line and out of anger and frusteration. I ask her if she again can solve this issue now instead of waiting until while she is back to work and she starts screaming again and says ""Am I speaking English, do I need to speak in another language for your brain to understand? You're making me angry and I will walk away on you"". I hang up.

Fast forward until the end of the night, I finish work and I come back home and she's back home. She starts apologising again, stating she didn't mean it, I'm the future father to her kids, doesn't see anyone else and doesn't want anyone else. She stated shes stubborn, and wants things her way, and gets angry when it doesn't go her way.

I didn't really have anything to say, I don't know what to think at this point. Obviously I still have a lot of feelings for her and we live together as well. But I am scared and worried about investing more time and effort and/or tieing ourselves in with bigger responsibilities ex. Marriage, Kids, Mortgage, if she's willing to pack her bags and walk out on family in the blink of an eye. I told her my love for you isin't something you turn around and use as a weapon and ammunition to have things your way ex. ""If you make me mad again, I will walk away on you again"". 

I am looking for some advise and help.

Thank you.

TL;DR: GF recieved a sexual message from a co-worker, didn't want to call about it and broke up stating I'm ""Investigating"". Next day she tells me she didn't mean it, just wanted the break up as a ""wake up call"" to see what happens if I continue to Investigate."
"Left my boyfriend for something he doesn’t remember


We’ve (me 33f him 38m) been on rocks for a while. Living together 5 years, we get along great generally but for the past year he’s been getting worse and worse. Best way to explain it is that he feels it’s ok to be an asshole if there is a reason to justify it and he will find a reason. He admits that he gets mean but thinks it’s justifiable.

last night he got drunk and started saying mean things so I went to bed. He followed me into our room and started venously shouting that I was a liar - pointing his finger in my face, doing everything he could to make me cry. (Which did work) I begged him to tell me what he thought i was lying about but he just kept saying “everything, you lie about everything.” He left after 10 min of this accusing and pointing and went back out to the living room to drink with his friends. 
He came to bed at 7 am this morning and was upset that I didn’t want him to sleep next to me (I moved so we would be head to toe) and when I reminded him of what he had done just a few hours before he had no recollection of it. 
He said he was sorry but I say that’s not good enough. The fact of the matter is that he wanted me to feel bad. 
Maybe it’s a little unfair that the straw that broke the camel’s back is something that he doesn’t remember doing… But he’s still defending his actions saying I probably was lying about something. 
Probably hard for you redditors to believe that I’m not a liar if that’s what he was saying but I honestly have no idea what he was talking about. 

Feeling like shit, sitting in my car with my suitcase at a rest stop not sure what to do next. Anybody have an outside opinion to run by me? 

TL;DR: leaving because of what he did while he was drunk "
"How do I [24F] navigate a career when I make everyone around me uncomfortabl


I have always had problems with the social aspects of life. I could never maintain a social group for more than 4 months in school before everyone started avoiding me and visibly didn't want me around. I desperately struggled through high school and University to find a social group that would accept me, but was an outsider in my internships, part time jobs, college, high school, volunteer gigs, and hobby groups. Things improved in college, where I met two very good friends. I could never spend time with them in a group, and they moved away soon after, but I spend hours on the phone with each of them, and receive immense support. Later in college I met my now husband. My husband and one of my friends were both homeschooled and never learned proper social cues, and my other close friend has autism.

My parents always told me the importance of being liked to succeed, and I knew it was something I lacked. I went to multiple therapists, but they never provided help beyond sympathising and offering advice I have tried in the past.

I am an engineer, and thought my work would be more independent than it is. My husband says that more complex work always requires collaboration, and will never be isolated like my lower level jobs were. I love what I do and am interested in it, but I can tell my coworkers don't like me. When I try to join in or start conversations everyone immediately disperses. It's the same situation as in all of my technical internships. This affects my performance as I can't receive the support I know I need to advance, and I am worried I will be let go for not being a culture fit. Especially when my job is externally a great fit for me; outdoors, no screens, lots of variety, and challenging.

My friends and husband have observed me and told me my tone is condescending, I act too intense, and obviously am not relaxed. I see the issue with this, and have made a good effort, but cannot shake these behaviours, even when I try to ask people questions about themselves and signal that I am a nice person.

My husband has offered for me to take a job on a factory line like I did when I was younger, as it made me happy. I don't want to let my hard work to achieve this position slip past me. I can find work easily, as my resume is impressive and I make a good first impression, I just can't keep it up. The stress after each day is getting to me. I try to ignore it and just plug away, but interesting opportunities in my work are not being offered, and I am watching my coworkers advance past me with support from higher-ups as well as each other.

How do I go about having a career when I make everyone around me uncomfortable?

Tldr; I am bad socially and no matter how much I try it isn't getting better. Am I doomed if I want to continue working as an engineer?"
"Boyfriend (27m) said if I (25f) got hurt he wouldn’t visit me at the hospital


The title alone sounds fucked up. I’m super upset about this and don’t even want to see his face right now

For context, we’ve been together almost four years as over that time he’s shown overprotective tendencies but not they’re borderline controlling.

I work a job where I meet people that may be violent, mentally unstable, and often have to conduct home visits in neighborhoods that aren’t safe. But all that aside, I love my job, I feel like I’m making a difference in peoples lives and I waited many years to land a job in my field. 

He’s disapproved since I started working there. He said he’s always worried about my safety and if I’m okay. He tried not to say anything because he saw how much I enjoyed my work. 

But yesterday a coworker asked me if I could conduct a home visit with her because she found out her client had attempted to stab someone in her past and she was nervous. I said yes. I texted my boyfriend to let him know I’d be leaving work later because I was helping my coworker with the visit. He said ok. 

My coworker ended up going on her own and when I called my boyfriend I made a joke saying I’d probably run if someone tried to stab me because I wouldn’t know how to defend myself against a weapon. He very seriously said “well if you actually got stabbed just know I wouldn’t visit you at the hospital,” I asked why and he said because at that point I chose to put myself in that situation. 

I was baffled. Didn’t even know what to say. So I told him it was my job, and he said no that it sounded like I volunteered myself. My supervisor was aware and approved me going with coworker, so at that point it was also a direct order from my supervisor. I told him this. And he said well either way, it’s your life and your choice, I just wouldn’t go out of my way to visit you. 

I asked if he wouldn’t do the same for his friend and he said it was different, that he’s known his friends for years and I’ve known my coworker for a few months. He said he’s disapproved of my job from the beginning and I knew that, but he never voiced his disapproval because he knew I liked my job even though my happiness came at his expense. 

That was probably the most selfish thing I’d heard. Because it seemed like me getting hurt was at his expense, like it mattered more how he felt about it than me actually being hurt. 

I don’t even know how to talk to him about it. I told him that was hurtful and he said he knew it would hurt when he said it. 

Tl;dr boyfriend said if I got hurt at my job he wouldn’t visit me at hospital because I put myself in that situation. How do I talk to him about how I feel?"
"I fell in love with a much older man. Can there be a future here, or am I being crazy? [31F, 55M]


I met Joe in March of last year. I had recently joined my friends running club, and Joe was also a runner. I got the opportunity to chat with him a bit, and he was very kind and funny (not to mention incredibly handsome). I asked my friend if she knew if he was single, and she said ""I think so"". So, I decided to ask him out. He seemed really surprised, but he agreed. 

So, he planned the best date EVER. We had so much fun, tons of chemistry and pretty much couldn't keep our hands off each other. In between seeing each other, we would text and talk on the phone every day. A few days after our date, we were talking on the phone and Joe said he really wanted to see me again, but ""I just want to give you a heads up, I'm 55 years old. I hope that isn't an issue, but I understand if it is because you are clearly quite a bit younger"".

I was SHOCKED. Joe looks like he's in his early or mid 40s and when I asked him out, I assumed there was like 10-15 year age difference which isn't that big of a deal when you're over 30. I had really enjoyed his company though, so I said I still wanted to see him again. I wasn't necessarily looking to settle down, and he was very sweet and sexy. 

We continued to see each other somewhat casually - Joe has a high-powered job and travels very frequently for work, but he would always jump at the chance to spend time together when he was home. After a few months, Joe told me that he wasn't seeing anyone else and asked if I would be his girlfriend. I hadn't been dating anyone else either, my focus had been on work and traveling and Joe, so I said yes. We started dating exclusively, met the friends and family, vacationed together, all that. I totally fell in love with Joe, but with the age difference I figured there wasn't much of a future for us so I was just happy to be spending time and having fun with an awesome guy. I kind of assumed he wasn't looking to settle down, he was divorced and had an adult kid already. We never really talked about the future, except to make plans a few months in advance.

A few weeks ago, Joe asked if we could sit down and have a serious conversation about the future. I wasn't sure what to expect. Joe basically told me that he was hoping to retire soon and wanted someone to share his life with. He said he loved me and wanted it to be me, and asked how I felt about getting engaged in the next year. He said ""I realize that you probably didn't see yourself with someone in their 50s. I certainly didn't see myself with someone 25 years younger than me. While I was dating after my divorce, I was looking for women closer to my age and in the same stage of life as me. But I love you and want to have a life with you. He also said that he knew that the age difference was a big compromise, and he didn't want me to miss out on anything if I chose him, so if I wanted a big wedding then we would have a wedding. If I wanted to have kids, he would be happy to be a stay-at-home dad in his retirement so I could build a career. He also said that he has enough money that we will have a comfortable life even with him not working, and I will never have to be a nurse to him. He told me that he wanted to marry me and if I wanted the same thing, we would continue seeing each other and working towards that, and if I didn't see a future with him then I would understand, but he'd rather know now.

I am freaking out. It's not that I haven't thought about it. My relationship with Joe has been the most fun I've ever had. There is no stress. I am so comfortable with him and I trust him implicitly. I still get excited every time I get a text from him, like a giddy teenager. I love his company. He is so respectful and considerate and reliable. He is an amazing dad. I love taking care of him and supporting him, and he is very supportive of me. He is SO sexy and amazing in bed. The only thing that concerns me is the age difference - I know that by choosing him, I am pretty much guaranteed to be a widow in my 40s or 50s. Whatever life I build with him will inevitably end, and then I will have to restart entirely. However...I have friends who married men our age who are now divorced and restarting in their 30s and 40s anyway. 

Writing all this out was cathartic. I could use some advice. Can this possibly work? Am I being insane?

**tl;dr** Have been dating a much older man. I fell in love with him but didn't know what kind of future there was, so I was just enjoying his company and living in the moment. He told me he wants to marry me, and asked what I thought. He would be an amazing husband. But the age difference...am I being crazy?"
"My in-laws are trying to force me to have a relationship with my SIL. I have no interest but don't want to damage relationships.


I (26F) have never been a huge fan of my SIL (31F). She acts like a 12 year old trapped in an adult's body: not only socially awkward, but also inappropriate, emotionally immature, and self-centered. She's never been diagnosed with anything and she has a degree, so there's nothing that really explains her off-putting behavior. She's never held a job consistently and is entirely dependent on her parents, my in-laws.

I love my in-laws and have a good relationship with them, but they do not set any boundaries with her and seem to expect me and my husband to do the same. They've asked us to provide a social outlet for her by taking her out to do things, but I find her difficult and unpleasant to be around due to her strange behavior. She asks us to do many favors for her, like giving her a ride somewhere, that then turn into much bigger favors, like waiting around for hours to take her back home. Whenever we see her, she reports everything we've said and done back to her parents.

As a result, we've stopped seeing her as much and have said no to the favors she asks, but now my in-laws have been pestering us to have her over to our apartment. We live in adjoining cities so it's not too far away. I have no desire to have her over, when she has no sense of tact and will openly blurt out anything that comes to mind. I don't want her criticizing everything where I live. My husband doesn't necessarily care as much, and is put in an awkward position. He is willing to put up with more because of 'family', whereas I was abused by a family member for years so do not believe in excusing poor behavior because someone is 'family'.

How do I navigate this situation without damaging my relationship with my MIL and FIL, but still maintaining the boundaries that I've set? Is that even possible to do? Am I being the jerk here?

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR: I don't want to have a relationship with my unpleasant SIL. My in-laws are trying to make that happen anyways. What do I do?"
"My partner (M/26) always thinks pain and life in general is a competition with me (F/25)


Basically my partner had a bad workplace injury resulting in him genuinely being partially disabled in the knee due to no medical fix until he ""comes of age"" for a knee replacement. He can still walk fine etc, he's just on long lasting pain relief long term to manage his pain. He also has degeneration of his joints in his back, also some buldging/slipped discs and has been referred to a specialist.

He's been this way for many years (since 2010) and hasn't worked for like 8years on and off, light duties etc... anyway financially it has been no problem because he's had some generous workplace compensation payouts, resulting in him buying me a new car, buying us a house, paying out my debts etc...I never asked, he just did it. But now....He always uses this against me. I've worked full time since I was 17 and left school. I did fitting and machining, fly in fly out work 12-14hr days, I then went into veterinary nursing full time, then pet store manager 10.5hr days. I've always worked.

Now the issue is we fell pregnant, and I'm still currently pregnant, I'm high risk and was told to quit work, for multiple reasons. My partner knows this, I ended up at the doctors once in heaps of pain, I thought something was wrong but it was I did too much housework and cleaning out my pet rabbit's, like I overdid it. Doctor told me to please take it easy at home, so I've listened. But my partner now just thinks I'm lazy, always makes joke comments about things not being done around the house. Things DO get done, but not straight away like I used to.

He only works 7days a fortnight 12hr shifts, I ask him to help me with heavy stuff (like filling up the mop bucket so I can mop our floors) he always huffs and puffs and says he's tired from work and wants to relax. He said he's sick of me asking for help all the time - I've never been this way prior to pregnancy so obviously it's a shock to him to have to do things. When we met he wasn't working, he sat at home all day everyday playing video games, watching tv etc...And I would come home and do all the chores, feed animals, make dinner etc...its just what I'm used to, and to be honest it never bothered me, I've always been a busy person.

He says I don't understand what it's like to work 12hr days, even though I have for many more years than he has, but then says ""but my job is harder"" I will mention my back is really sore due to the pregnancy and he will tell me ""Oh welcome to my world"" ""talk to me when you have buldging discs"" I will say I feel sick or my hips hurt, but he will always confirm he's in more pain.

It's becoming frustrating, I try to talk to him about it and he always makes it about himself, I try to tell him just to help me for the 9 months I'm pregnant because I'm struggling and he just thinks he doesn't need to because he's the sole provider of the household, then he will bring up ""you wouldn't have your car paid off if it wasn't for me"" ""we wouldn't have this house if it wasn't for me"" ""I didn't work before but I compensated you well and truly with money and gifts"" 

I just want him to understand the changes I'm going through, and the stress of being high risk. He doesn't understand I'm bored out of my mind at home not working or keeping busy, it's not my lifestyle, I always tell him I would rather be the worker than the pregnant person. He supports me in the sense he always asks if I'm ok, he comes to every appointment with me, but it always turns into something about him, even if it's just he has a super bad headache.

I just feel like I can't be looked after or helped when I need it, and it's becoming draining being dizzy and tired all the time, having morning sickness all the time, not being able to eat much, I have a bad blood disorder and have had blood clots from standing for too long. I just feel like I wish it could be about me for once, but every time I bring it up, he will say ""okay baby I'm sorry, I will try"" ...then it's the same. I guess I feel like I'm worrying about myself so much and him still, but he's barely concerned about me, I know he cares about me, but he always makes it about him in the end.

Am I expecting too much of him? Is there anything else I can do or try to make him understand. I think he feels like I'm lying to get out of doing things. One time I was making a fry up of a breakfast for us, I started to feel like I was going to pass out as I got super super hot and my heart started racing, I asked him to take over and he cracked the shits about it. He didn't verbally say anything, it was more him sighing and body language. He then asked if I was ok and I said yeah I'll be okay, but it didn't feel genuine.

I will add he's always kind of been this way, his mother is like this too. When they're together it's so annoying because they always try to one up each other's medical issues. For me I have medical issues but have been taught to harden up and get on with life it's nothing you can change. It's draining listen to him complain everyday about his pain, I understand he's in pain but it is just so draining to listen about it all the time.

TL;DR; 
Partner always says he's worked harder than me in life, that I don't understand working 12hr days when I do, I'm pregnant and I think he thinks I'm using it as a way out of doing things even though he's been to doctor appointments with me when they've told me to bed rest. Not sure if I'm expecting too much from him or if there's a different approach to the situation? Other than just talking to him."
"My Husband (46M) is not happy with my (43F) new found career


 This will probably be a long one, bear with me and thank you for taking the time out to read/comment

I am very lucky. I grew up relatively wealthy and married a man with a similar background. He is an amazing husband and we have a lot of love in our 20 years together. It was evident that he would be the family provider and I would be able to work or not work. I worked part time until we got pregnant then became a stay at home mom. My husband makes enough for us to live very comfortably. He loves to spoil the family with gifts and vacations and takes care of all of our bills.

Once our second went off to school i started to grow bored and restless at home. I got really into DIY and converted a spare room in the house into a craft room for myself. I worked with glass and wood mostly making creative home decor items that you would find on Pinterest or Etsy. I really enjoyed it! I go so good I was making furniture pieces with reclaimed wood in 6 months. Then I began selling my pieces to friends or at local craft shows. At this point my husband thought it was ""so cute"" that I had a hobby of my own. He told me whatever money i made to reinvest in materials and tools I needed or to treat myself.

Then our third went off to school and I started looking into interior design and renovation projects. I started by redoing our home kitchen making it an open concept, modern room. I dont think my husband believed I did it with minimal assistance (I only needed a plumber and my token ""Strong Man""). again all fine.

Fast forward a few years, I now have a well sought after home design business. Local contractors work through me on major and minor reno projects (thank God for everyone's love for HGTV) and i also create home decor pieces that I sell when i stage homes for real estate agents. I am making good money and I work on a great schedule that allows me to see my kids everyday.

Now onto my husband.... He enjoyed my ""hobby"" at first but about a year in he had some confusion over how low our monthly credit card bill was. I was paying for things like clothes, hair, nails, makeup with cash instead. He initially was ok with me putting the money into a educational trust for the children and having a separate account for myself but constantly makes comments about ""my big bucks"". He told me he wanted to continue paying for the household expenses when I told him I would contribute. Now whenever I come home with shopping bags he rolls his eyes and make sarcastic comments. I know he hates when I spoil him but he eventually accepts it.

At a recent dinner party he joked that I should be designing homes on the Sims game and who knew how much rich people love recycled wood. He belittled me in front of friends and I never saw that side of him before. I tried to talk to him about his comfort-ability with me making my own money and he responded by saying he didn't want to see me get stressed out and that I should enjoy my life. He is a great father and always there for games,plays, recitals, etc. but now he challenges me when i need help taxing them around. (Meanwhile he used to have no problem leaving work so I can take a certain Yoga class in the next town over).

I really like having this job! I love what i do and making money on my own is pretty cool too. I never had this opportunity and I am really good at what I do.

So last night I decided to talk to him directly. I told him I knew he had issues and we needed to resolve them. He brushed me off a lot and kept saying he has no issues but doesn't understand why I am not fulfilled with just the family. He said somethings about if i love him/ am happy with him. (I AM!) He then said he can't wait for me to grow out of this stage of my life and called it arts and crafts. HE WAS SO DEMEANING! again, not used to this. I grew angry with him and he changed his tune a bit. Why don't you start a non profit? Why don't you build homes for the poor? Which honestly were not bad ideas but they're not exactly what I want to do right now. But the real kicker was when I suggested he could work fewer hours and I would be able to cover the difference. He said that was such an insult to his work and that he made a promise to me that he would be the provider. ?????

Please help. I am not looking to divorce my husband over this but help me understand why me making money is such an attack on him being a man/provider. Any advice on how to communicate this better with my husband? This is new for us both.

PS I also just purchased a romantic getaway to Napa Valley for his birthday and am afraid of his reaction )=

TL,DR: Provider husband unhappy that I am now making money on my own with a home reno/design job. "
"My [29m] girlfriend [29f] of 1.5 years can't go to sleep until I'm home.


We lived together unofficially for the past six months (she was over at my apartment 99% of the time) and finally got a new place together a few weeks ago, and this came up this weekend.

&amp;#x200B;

My girlfriend Z suffers from anxiety, for which she is medicated and goes to therapy. One of the way this manifests is that she can't go to sleep until I am home, otherwise she worries incessantly. This essentially means I live on a curfew because she likes to go to bed pretty early.

&amp;#x200B;

It came up on Saturday, as I went out with a few friends to play board games (I invited her but she didn't want to come along). Come 11:30pm she wanted me to come home, and I wanted to stay out later. She said she was worried about me, but it was about a tame of a night as possible - me and four friends playing DnD, a mile or two away from my apartment, and in a city so I would be ubering home with a friend that lived near me. Essentially, there was nothing to worry about - no drunk driving, no walking alone through dark alleyways.

&amp;#x200B;

I am not a huge drinker so it is not an issue of her worrying that I would get too drunk, or cheat on her or anything (all my friends are guys). She has complained that I wake her up when I come home late, but I've offered to sleep on the couch so as to not disturb her, but she didn't accept that and still wants me home earlier than I want to be. This also isn't something I do constantly, even she admits that the last time she can remember me not being home until late was on Halloween (I went to a bar a few blocks away from my apartment, again with friends).

&amp;#x200B;

She has a history of being a worrier - for instance she has a tremendous fear of flying, even though she rationally knows that plane crashes are extremely rare. It seems like kind of the same thing here - the odds of something terrible happening to me during a DnD session seem very low, but she can't shake the thought of it anyway.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm having a hard time approaching this because I don't intend on spending the rest of my life on a curfew, but I can't just tell her to get over it and not worry about me. Does anyone know of a good way to approach the problem?

&amp;#x200B;

tl;dr: my girlfriend worries about me when I'm not home, and can't sleep until I'm home and she knows I'm safe. This feels like living on a curfew and I want to be able to have the freedom to stay out late on occasion if I want to. I don't know how to approach the issue because it is a manifestation of her anxiety, for which she is already medicated and going to therapy for."
"My coworkers complain about me because I’m unlikeable. HR wants to meet in a few hours to talk, how do I handle this meeting? How do I change my behaviour?


Throwaway because my main has lots of info about my job, and I don’t want one of my coworkers to connect dots. Everyone is early to late twenties, with  the exception of HR who is mid thirties. 

Tl;dr: My coworkers complain a lot about me, most likely because I’m unlikeable. Recently I pushed back at a complaint because it’s not true, and now HR would like to meet with me in a few hours to talk about how I have a mountain of complaints. I never complain about my coworkers, so I am not sure how to defend myself without making it look like I am blaming them. 

I’ve been at my job for about a year now. I work in a specialty area and my job is to do all the client related stuff- Find clients, follow up with them, etc. Because of the client oriented nature of my job, I work in a separate area of the building- think of it like, I work in the front whereas everyone else works in the warehouse or support rooms. 

I don’t want to type forever and I really do need help because my coworkers complain a crazy amount about me, and our HR (we’re a small company so we have just one person in Hr) would like to meet with me in a few hours to talk about this. 

This is something that has been building up for some time. I was hired because I care about our clients and am amazing with them, but for some reason, I just can’t seem to get along with my coworkers. 

I think part of it is that I rarely see them, so I don’t have the same camaraderie that they have with each other. It’s not because I’m new, because a coworker who started 4 months ago gets along with everyone just fine. 

Recently, my coworker “Anne” and I got into a bit of a disagreement. She had asked me to do something that, while it wasn’t exactly my job, it was a grey area and I could have done it. However I had another urgent task to complete, and she insisted I could do both at the same time. I didn’t think that was fair because it would mean half -assing two tasks, and I don’t like doing that. I delegated the tasks, and she complained. 

My other coworker “Susan” has been there for a really long time and she likes to give really long lectures to me about any mistakes I’ve made. One time, I had asked during a slow time if I could complete X task ahead of time, and she spent 20 minutes telling me why I couldn’t. Also, Anne had complained to Susan about me not doing a task for her, and Susan told me why I should’ve said yes and how I’m not being helpful by refusing and told me, without saying it explicitly, that I should’ve half-assed both tasks. Susan also once told me off for asking one of the warehouse workers to do something for me which was a part of their job. She said I should’ve done it- which is true and I would’ve done it myself in the past, however they weren’t doing anything and my boss told me that she wants me to focus on doing the job she pays me to do. And she wants the other works to do what they’re paid to do, so it’s okay for me to ask them to do things that are a part of their job. 

Then I have coworker “Sam”. I don’t think Sam complains that much about me, and I think Sam and I sometimes do get along, but it feels like there is tension there. Part of it is that Sam is older than I am and started around the same time as me, so they think they have some sort of seniority over me and often tells me how I should do my job. Some points Sam makes are good and help me do my job better, but mostly it seems as though Sam expects too much from me. I do like Sam though, I think they’re neat and I want to get along with them more. 


I think the worst though is Anne. She complains about my personality and how I’m very strict and uptight, about how I do my job, and anything else she can think of. I recently found out that she complains a lot about me, however when she makes mistakes or if I don’t like how she does something, I just let it go (unless it’s a big mistake). 
I recently found out she said I slack off a lot, and I did protest because I don’t slack, but it’s my word against hers. Especially because I don’t complain about her, so she has some history regarding my behaviour. 

It makes me worried because HR wants to meet and if I do keep my job, it will make it difficult to mention her slip ups without sounding as though I’m doing it because she complained about me. 

Also, here is another reason why I think I don’t get along with my coworkers- I’m super work oriented which can sometimes be :/ 
I had a bunch of trauma in my childhood so I find it difficult to open up to people. 
I try not to be, but I’m a little set in my ways which can make me difficult to change. I am trying to change that though. 

I would love some advice on how my get along with my coworkers, and how to handle this meeting with HR. Especially because I cry when I’m upset and I don’t want to cry. "
"My (24m) girlfriend (23f) has gotten really close to this guy she met recently. He confessed to me he likes her. Should I be worried?


She and I have been dating for about 6 months. It's been pretty much perfect besides a few issues here and there that we always manage to talk through and discuss like mature adults. 

She's super into photography and does it on the side a lot. Maybe 3-4 months back she went to a photography event in our area and met a guy named N there. Since then, they have both gotten pretty close and she has been open with me about their relationship. They hang out frequently, usually doing shoots, grabbing food, or just chilling. They text every day and as of recent she has been facetimeing him nightly. I know this because on multiple occasions in the past month I have casually texted her asking what she's up to and she will give me some flavor of ""Oh I'm facetiming N"" or ""Oh I just facetimed N earlier and now i'm doing this"". I expressed to her that their friendship makes me uncomfortable and she said she understood, and reassured me that she sees him nothing more than a close friend. She even started texting him and facetiming him a little bit less and not as excessively as she did before but I still feel kind of uncomfortable.

I have gone through her texts with him a few times (I know this is wrong) and she talks a lot about me to him (good things) but it makes me jealous how deep their conversations are. She tells him a lot and they share a lot with each other. There's nothing she's told him that I didn't already know but still...

I have hung out with them on multiple occasions but yesterday we were all chilling at her place and she ran out to grab some snacks and drinks so it was just me and him. We were chatting a little and then I semi-jokingly asked him if anything was going on between him and my gf. He told me no, but after a bit of back and forth he told me he did have feelings for her and that he's not actively trying to pursue her, but that he feels they belong together and will end up together eventually and ""that's just the way it is"". Gf came back before I could finish my talk with him.

Later that night I told her what he had told me and she told me she believed me and takes my side over his, but that she was also a little hesitant because she ""knows the kind of guy N is and she doesn't think he would say something like that"". She called N confronting him and he is a good actor for sure. He acted bewildered, as if I was just a jealous boyfriend making that up to stop them from hanging out. After their talk she told me she knows I'm not lying, but that she needs some space to figure some stuff out and asked me to go home. I have not heard from her since and she has not been responding to my texts. I'm so lost on what to do. Advice would be appreciated.

tl;dr: Gf has a really close guy friend and he confessed to me that he wants to be with her. Gf confronted him for this and he acted like I was a jealous boyfriend making that up to drive them apart. Gf believes me but said she needed space and hasn't spoken to me since then."
"Is my friend [20F] falling for me [20M]?


Let me explain a bit, I am a 20M, I have known this girl since high school. Lets call her Sarah. Back in time we never used to do something out of school, we sometimes used to sit and talk during the lunch but nothing more. After the high school we became closer, hanging out at least once a week tho what got my attention was that every time we met it was like a little date such as picnic in the park etc. Things started to get weird when I had to leave the country for university, I would be visiting in holidays but interestingly she cried like an hour on my last day in the country. The thing is that I have never been actually close with her, I honestly don't think we have even something in common but it seemed like she enjoyed my accompany. Fast forward I came back after a year of studying outside of my country, when I came back, I noticed that she became more... touchy. Even in public, she would just hug, kiss me on the cheek and all her hands over me. After some time even my friends started to ask me if we were going out. I forgot to mention that I have C-PTSD so I have a problem being intimate with someone else. Few months back we started to stay at each others house, she would cook us dinner, we would watch a movie and she would just fall asleep on me. The night usually would en up us sleeping in her bed, spooning. She would even wake up early in the morning and cook me breakfast, if it is my house, she would usually have to leave early so she just leaves a lovely note and breakfast for me. Since then this became a habit, Sarah would call me whenever her house is empty. First I thought that she just hang out with me because she is all alone but she has a ton of friends, even more than me. What makes me wonder is that if she is being friendly in her own way or is she falling for me. Lastly let me add some details that I didn't know where to put them in, in one of our conversations she mentioned about marrying me in the future, which shocked me a bit and one time I forgot her birthday, yeah I am not proud of it but I was able to fix it with a candle on a burger. I am not used to relationships, I actually never had a serious one, only one night stands so this is freaking me out a bit. I honestly don't want to make a ""what are we?"" talk. Any opinions and recommendations are welcome!

tl;dr; Female friend acting weird, trying to understand if she is falling for me."
"My [24M] Girlfriend [27F] told me she's upset I didn't get her anything for Valentine's day


We've been dating for about seven months, and she recently told me this? I know Valentine's day was a while ago, but she was acting strange so I asked her did I do something to hurt her and she told me.

Sounds bad right? How could not possibly get my girlfriend anything? 

Well..that's where I'm confused. I gave her a ton. I actually thought I did amazing on Valentine's and was really happy with myself. I got her a bouquet of roses, box of chocolate, a chocolate heart, a bottle of wine, her favorite soda, a two gram prerolled blunt, a cake, and I brought T-Bones steaks which I cooked for us on Valentine's day along with mashed potatoes and veggies. I literally spend like $150 on everything.

The way I presented the stuff I thought was great too..I was like look I got you this..but look I got this too..and this too..and this too as I kept going into another room to get more.

Afterwards she got me a box of chocolates and a Tile key finder.

Am I going crazy?

TLDR; My girlfriend told me she's hurt I didn't get her a gift for Valentine's day when I got her plenty.

"My best friend (40F) is nagging me about going to a comic con, but I (26M) just bought a house and cant afford it


 So I bought a 5 acre farm 6 months ago. Farms are expensive, plus I'm doing reno on the house- new appliances, a new water heater, re doing the kitchen, painting, setting stuff up. That plus a lot of fence patching, which takes a ton of money. Saving for a new roof. All of it. 

However, I have in the past spent money on stupid shit. As well as falling for 2 scams that cost me 9000 dollars. Nine thousand. Not a typo. Things that she specifically told me not to do, and I did them anyways. So she's mad that I spent money being an idiot but wont soend money on something we really want to do. We go to cons every year, and before I had a house I could afford it. Now my bills have doubled and I just cant afford it anymore. I can afford one con- it's 45 minutes away. It would cost me around 300 bucks for me to go. The con she wants to go to would be around a thousand after plane and hotel and con itself. I asked her to go to it and she is considering. But she wants me to do the big 1000$ con too. That 700$ difference is a huge impact for me. Her bills are literally 1/3rd of mine because she rents with roommates. 

She is mad at me and yelling at me about not saving money for cons and I'm just really upset. She's my best friend and like a sister to me. She probably cant afford the big con without me- hotel bill would be huge, plus Ubers and stuff. And having me at a con is a huge advantage- I am disabled so we skip all the lines, which saves us hours. 

TLDR: Am I in the wrong? Is she right, that I spent money on stupid shit and now I'm not willing to spend money to be together? I just. I want to change. I want to get better with money so I can really make my house my own. "
"My [34f] Partner [32 MtF] of 2 years is undergoing hormone therapy and it feels like everything makes her upset now.


So three months ago my partner told me that after a lot of soul searching she had come to terms with the fact that she was trans, and that she was going to start medically transitioning with the help of her doctor. We had a long talk about what that might mean for our relationship, the process involved, all logistics stuff. Overall though I was optimistic and happy for her. We're both on the Ace spectrum and our relationship is largely non-sexual already so loss of attraction wasn't a huge concern. And I know first hand estrogen is a hell of a drug but Partner has always been there for me through my own medical needs and it was finally my turn to be there for them. 

So you can imagine I feel like the worst girlfriend on the face of the planet right now but it's been two months since she started hormones and I don't think there's been a day where she hasn't cried, or had a panic attack, or voiced consistent vocal displeasure with her body. 

Examples:

\-We were watching a movie, I had burnt the popcorn a little and didn't notice until after I sat down with it. I said ""Oh shoot popcorn's burnt"" and she started crying about how she can't do anything right until I somewhat bewilderedly reminded her that I was the one who made it.

\- She obsesses over the fact that she has male pattern baldness. I suggested maybe we could go wig shopping in what I thought was a fun 'girls day out' sort of way. She started crying and said needing a wig was proof she would never be a real woman.

\- She's become incredibly paranoid about people being able to ""tell"" she's trans before she's ready to come out to them. She was crying because she hated the fact she had stubble. I thought maybe she would feel better if maybe we did a shave and some foundation to cover it and she shot it down because then ""everyone would be able to tell I was a woman."" She was seeing a therapist before all this but refuses to come out to them. And refuses to find one that specializes in trans issues because then all her friends would know (presumably she'd be afraid of them googling the therapist's name? I'm not sure I follow on this one.)

\- I have my own mental health stuff. Not often but I had a bad day a couple weeks ago and actually had to kick her out of my house because her constant catastrophizing about it was just making it worse when all I'd wanted was someone to hold me for a bit. She used to make me tea and pet my hair and trust that things would pass. And if they didn't then trust that I would get in touch with my doctor. This time she sat on the bed next to me sobbing and telling me I couldn't just give up. When I told her to leave because this wasn't helpful she called a mutual friend and implied I was at risk of hurting myself (I wasn't) to get them to come check on me. 

This is just a very very small sample of the last two months and I love her and I want her to be happy and I want her to be her best self and this is really no time at all and I know it will eventually even out but I am worried about her because I don't know if this is a normal thing? And god it feels so gross and sexist to go ""ever since my partner started on estrogen she's just been way too emotional"" but I don't think that's what this is. I think she probably always had anxiety and body image issues and now she just feels able to express them out loud. And I'm worried she won't seek help and I'm worried that I'm going to burn out way too quickly trying to be her sole support in this. What's worse is she's been equally high strung with her regular friends and since they don't know what's going on they've started pulling back from her. 

I guess I'm wondering is there a way to approach this with her sensitively and without sounding like I'm making this all about my delicate cis feelings while she's clearly going through a LOT more than I am? I don't want to make this all about me, but I'm not an infinite emotional labor machine either. 

Tl;DR: My partner's transition has been rougher than either of us expected and she won't talk to anyone but me about the trouble she's having. I'm trying to be there for her, but being the anxiety sponge is painful and exhausting and I feel ready to throw in the towel after only two months. What do?

"My (27m) family have been bad mouthing and making fun of my girlfriends (25f) teeth, and it's making me want to cut contact. Is this dramatic?


I've been with my girlfriend for almost a year and a half now, but only in the last few months my family has met her. Before this, I actually had moved to her home state and they'd only ever see photos.

We moved to where I live now and they've finally got to meet the girl I hope to marry one day.

When we met, she refused to ever smile showing teeth and said she was too embarrassed. She has a gap, and she is also missing a tooth a couple of teeth next to her front.

She had told me her parents were incredibly neglectful, never took her to a dentist, never had her brush as a kid etc. She also has an addiction to diet soda which I'm trying to help her break, because she doesn't ever drink water.

She's said that once she was really old enough to realize how bad her teeth were, it was too late. She had no insurance. I've taken her to a dentist for a cleaning and to see what needs to be done. It's going to cost *a whole lot*. Thousands of dollars. It's just not going to happen anytime soon.

She's now recently discovered she's got a cracked tooth next to her missing tooth, and has said if it breaks off she won't ever smile again until she ""wins the lottery and can fix it"". 

Even though I've made sure she knows I love her to death, nothing about her is bad, she's beautiful etc. She still gets extremely insecure and covers her mouth sometimes even when we talk. 

So onto the whole problem, my family finally met her... I was absolutely *shocked* at the way they were. My older sister kept whispering things and asking ""why does she smile when her teeth look that bad?""

My brothers kept cracking jokes at me, but not ever in front of her. Asking why did I ""pick a homeless girl"". Am I ""dating her because I feel bad for her"" ""how do I ignore it"" ""how could I even kiss her"" etc etc.

I made sure they knew how angry and absolutely disgusted I was by all of them. I ended up leaving with my girlfriend and haven't talked to them since.

I've been strongly considering cutting contact but I'm not sure if this is an overreaction? I don't know. I've never had anything happen like this, but I've never been this angry before. What should I do?
 They all just seem to find this funny.

Tl;dr; my family has been making fun of my girlfriends teeth after they finally met her. I'm considering cutting contact, but is that too much of an overreaction?"
"My Dad (65) told me (30) he loves me as a woman and not like a daughter


TL;DR The man who raised me, the man I call dad, told me he doesn't love me as a daughter, but as a woman!

What's up dear Redditors, 
I'm not sure if this is the right sub for this, but I'm desperate and just dono where to ask for advice on this weird ass situation.
Here's the deal, but I gotta provide you with some general info first:
My real father (who was never a father to me) was pretty good at this whole drinking and domestic violence thing, so I was happy when he left me and my mom when I was 4 years old.
Shortly after that my mom met another guy. He had a little trouble getting used to being a father all of a sudden (I was 5 and rough to handle when we met) and that was ok, cause over the years he became my dad and to me he always did an amazing job. Couple weeks after my 18th birthday my parent's marriage was over and my mom and I moved out. I had a hard time trying to stay out of their issues, cause there was no way for my mom to hide her feelings that time. Sometimes my mom got mad at me for loving my dad so much, cause everything that had happend really did make him look like a total piece of shit, but to me he was still my dad and I told her I was glad I would never have to see this side of him (cause he could never cheat on me for example cause he's my dad). I was only gonna judge him by his dad qualities, cause to me their marriage was none of my business.
So ever since we moved out my dad kept hoping I'd come back home and told me he missed me.
I missed him too, so I visited him every once in a while. Then he got remarried to a woman who is only 5 years older than me!! (so more than 20 years difference to my dad!!) I never really liked her, but I accept her cause she seems to make my dad happy.
Ok, so far so good, but now comes the weird part:
Couple days ago my dad sent me 17 texts at 2am, telling me that ever since mom and I left, he began to understand his love for me. He started out loving me as a daughter, but now he loves me as a woman!! He told me how sexy he thinks I am and asked me to please not be mad at him for loving me. He had always tried to be a good dad...and over the years an ever better man for me. The messages got worse and really freaked me out (somewhere between throwing up and crying,you know?)!! I didn't anwer his texts tho...well shit, I just didn't know what to say and I also feel terrible for his wife.
Can anyone give me a hint on how to deal with this sick situation? How would you feel and what would you do?
Thank you guys so much in advance"
"I (21M) have a crush on my friend/coworker (23F) and it's taking a huge toll on my relationship with my girlfriend (23F)


Long post, TLDR at the bottom.


I've been with my girlfriend for three years, we moved in together roughly a year ago and things have been great. We have a healthy relationship and we're still very much in love.

However, there's something that's having a big impact on our relationship right now. There is this girl that I've been sort of friends with since college, but I lost contact with her after we graduated (I'll call her M). We didn't really talk or anything, but last November she landed a job at the same company as me. She became my new partner and I've been spending time with her more or less everyday. We need to work together and slowly but surely we grew closer and we have become good friends at this point.

I told my girlfriend about M and she was happy that I found a new (well, not really) friend and encouraged our friendship. Ever since we started working together I caught myself thinking about her throughout the day, even at home. I thought that it would pass, but it didn't. Spending all this time with her helped these feelings grow and I've had a full blown crush on her since the beginning of this year.

I felt incredibly guilty for this and desperately tried to hide my feelings from both M and my girlfriend. It doesn't help that she has a very flirty personality and sometimes it really gets to me. I asked if I could be transferred to a different department, but this wasn't possible. In February we had a company party and I brought my girlfriend with me. Beforehand she even told me how excited she was to meet M, so I introduced them to each other. We talked with the three of us for quite some time, and I thought it went pretty well. I was happy that I was no longer 'hiding' M from my girlfriend and that she knew who she was.

The next day my girlfriend starting asking about her, and it more or less turned into an interrogation. She asked me if I ever did something with her in the past and wanted to know everything about her. I asked her what was up, and she told me that she saw how well we connected with each other that the chemistry was clearly visible. She also said that M was flirting with me that night. I didn't answer immediately and didn't know how to react, and this caused my girlfriend to become suspicious, She kept pressing me and eventually I told her about my crush on M, but I assured her that it was just a crush and that nothing was happening between us. She (obviously) didn't like this and became very emotional, but I didn't want to lie to her and she wanted to know the truth.

Ever since that day things have been a little rough. My girlfriend doesn't like it at all that I am spending most of my day with her, and I would feel exactly the same if roles were reversed. I still am crushing on M and I hate it. Girlfriend and I agreed to set boundaries, and I don't talk to her outside of work anymore. I told her about my transfer that got denied, and we both know that quitting or switching jobs is financially not possible right now.

I tell my girlfriend I love her everyday and I assure her that nothing will happen between me and M, but I get how she's feeling. It's putting a lot of pressure on our relationship and I don't know when I can get out of this situation. M has asked me why I haven't been talking to her lately and texts me sometimes, but I just told her I've been busy with my private life. She's always around me and it's driving me insane, I can't stand it. I don't know why I have these feelings for her and why it can't go away. I go weak whenever I see her and it's only getting worse.

Please. What do I do with this. I don't want to lose my girlfriend over some stupid crush. What's the best way to go about this. If anyone has personal experience with a similar situation, please share how you handled it.


TLDR: Old friend started working at the same company as me and we became partners. Over time I've started to develop a crush on her and it's only growing. My girlfriend noticed it after a company party, and eventually I told her about it. She isn't happy and we decided set boundaries, but it isn't really helping. Can't change departments or quit/switch jobs right now and it's taking a huge toll on our relationship."
"I [28F] am going through a real slump while my friends are all becoming stable and successful. I'm scared they'll pull away from me because I seem like a mess and my problems are that of somebody in their early 20s


I've always been a good student who's known what I wanted to do with my life. Through my time studying I made some great friends and we were all on the same page. I started my PhD in 2013 before falling into a real depression. I was diagnosed with major depressive disorder and anxiety. I'm still working on my PhD and hope to finish soon, but everyone else I know finished years ago. They're now doctors or researchers or medical professionals making a real salary, progressing their careers and buying property etc. I'm still working on my degree, am about to move back in with my parents, and have no idea what I want to do with my career. I feel aimless and hopeless. I feel like my friends see me as pathetic and if I don't get my act together they won't want to hang out with me anymore. It makes me want to avoid them because I'm so ashamed of talking about my life. Has anyone else been through this? I'm scared I won't be able to cope if they actually do drift away. And I'm so embarrassed I can't get my shit together. 

*TL;DR** My friends are much more put together and successful than me and I feel embarrassed. How to deal with the shame of not living up to what they have done while still staying friends? "
"Family and friends keep trying to set me [28/F] up with random men and I am just not interested.


Hello all,

I’m a 28 year old woman who got out of a very toxic relationship a little over a year ago. I actually posted about it here. Basically I was gaslit for almost 8 years and then ghosted by my fiancée in a very strange way. The post was deleted and I don’t care to go back into it again. 

Anyways, after basically giving 8 years of my life to a narcissist abuser, I decided I was going to take some time to do things for me that got neglected during my relationship. Travel, buying a home, and earning my masters degree were among the things I wanted. I’m living in my new house and have traveled many places in the last year. I am one semester into my masters degree. 

I’ve made it very clear to everyone around me that I am not interested in dating for the time being. Honestly, I find no attraction to anyone right now. I am still dealing with coming out of an abuse situation and my focus for now is me. However, some people in my life can’t take the fact that I am not interested and dating and continue to try set me up with random dudes I don’t even know. 

I get messages from guys often that say “so and so told me to message you, that you were single, etc.” Followed by a message from a friend or family member saying “this guy is so nice I hope you don’t care I gave him your number!!!!” I’m getting tired of turning these people down. 

I actually had a friend of my moms who I don’t know well at all, have a guy message me that turned out to be massively creepy.

Some of my close friends and family know not to do this and respect my wishes. But others think I’ll “change my mind when I met _____” and just ignore what I want. They can’t wrap their heads around someone choosing to be single. I had one person say “if I was pushing 30 I’d want to find someone!!!” 

I’ve been clear and plain about this but it’s not sinking in. Any advice at all? 

TLDR: After an 8 year toxic relationship, I want to take some time to be single and do things for me. However, some people in my life do not listen and continue to try and set me up with random people. It’s getting tiresome and I just need advice on what to do.

"My (28F) Boyfriend (26M) fapped to his ex after I asked him to come to bed.



Bf of 3 years and I currently live together and have a 1.5year old daughter.
This is going to sound weird but our walls are super thin. After I asked him if he wanted to come to bed with me and he said no, I literally heard him masterbating on the PC, which is right outside our bedroom.  
I have no issue with porn as long as it is not to exes or Facebook people we know ect and he knows this.
I was curious as I don't normally hear him and he has always said that he doesn't watch porn because it looks too fake...he even has said this to friends so I believe it.

Today I looked at his PC history and open was old messages to and from his ex from when they were together, with pics of her nudes open in history on Facebook. 
This crushed me. He knew how I felt about jerking it to real people, let alone his ex..

Is this something normal? I know he wouldn't cheat with her but this feels like emotional fuelled fapping and I feel betrayed. It upsets me that instead of coming to me he chose to look at his ex's nudes. As a recent new mom to his baby girl, I already struggling to accept my new body and we rarely have sex due to the baby.

Any insight whether I should get over myself or have a talk with him? 

TL;DR: bf chose to masterbate to nudes of his ex instead of come to bed with me. It feels wrong and I feel hurt but don't know if it is worth bringing up or getting over it myself. Should I ask him to delete her as friends and delete her messages and pics or is that too extreme?

**UPDATE: So I gave him a chance to tell the truth. I asked him if he uses Facebook or real people to get off, and he promised me that he didn't, not knowing what I already knew. I said I know it is awkward but you know you can tell me anything and he still denied it. So I told him to delete the girl, the messages and showed him this thread.
We have not spoken much since and I am struggling to not feel worthless and get past this. He has deleted his ex and 7 other girls on his Facebook that I am guessing he also had nudes of that he uses 
So he not only masterbated to his ex's nudes, but lied to my face. 
Apologies I am not sure how to do a proper update post on mobile."
"My [27 M] girlfriend [23 F] of two years is incapable of doing literally anything herself.


I have been with my current girlfriend since college.  After we both got jobs post graduation we moved in together.  Things were great in college.      
     
The trouble is - my girlfriend has always relied heavily on family.  I wasn’t aware just *how* much until after we moved in.  It started innocently enough.  “Hey can you help me with this issue with my computer?”  Sure I can help.  But this progressed to more and more.  I can’t get my health insurance with my employer until you sign up for me.  I can’t file my taxes until you do them for me. I can’t get groceries until you take me to the store.  I can’t apply for jobs unless you fill the application out for me.  Etc etc etc.     
    
I don’t really know what to do.  I’m starting to think that I’m a total asshole here but then logically I think about it and it doesn’t make any sense.  She’s *smart*.  She graduated cum laude with a science degree.  She’s held a steady job through college and since graduating.  I don’t understand why she is refusing to do anything for herself.  Sometimes she will say “I’m always there for my family and they’re always here for me.”    
    
I later found out that for the previous four years her family members have basically done every “adulting” thing for her.  Paid her car insurance.  Scheduled her dentist appointments.  Etc.  For reference, she lived at home during school.  She has an older brother (25) who still lives at home (and has a four year old son who he does *not* behave responsibly with) and a younger sister (19) who is in danger of not finishing high school (was held back a year, skips class very often).    
    
She has so much potential and she’s really amazing most of the time, but when I confront her about taking any sort of responsibility she will shut down and withdraw.  Shut herself in the bedroom and stop communicating.  “Leave me alone” or simple yes/no type responses.    
    
TLDR: GF is for whatever reason incapable of doing normal adult responsibilities like paying a bill on time or scheduling an appointment.     
Anyone have any thoughts ?"
"My Partner (37F) has become a MLM distributor and I (33M) don't know what to do.


My GF and I have been together for about 5 years now.  She has recently joined a MLM business as a distributor, and I am having a hard time with it.  We are both independent people, and I want to support her decision, but i am obviously having a difficult time doing that.  

She already has a full time job, another part time job she can pick up shifts at, and has recently completed her masters, and i am confident she is avoiding applying for a job in that field based on a fear she is going to fail, or not be happy with a job in that field.

I know the facts. 99% of all distributors will lose money.  And she does not have money or time to throw away.  She believes in the products she would be selling, and is quite stubborn and defensive (as am I). 

I rarely have a problem being open and honest with her about virtually anything.  But i am at a loss this time.  She knows i don't want her doing this, but... She has student loans, a mortgage she has to pay, and occasionally lets credit card debt compound, rather than talking to me and getting it paid off immediately (the interest rates obviously make it ridiculous to not avoid it at all costs).

I HATE the idea of her wasting her money and time, and I just want to avoid that happening to her.  She has asked me if she can talk to a couple of my friends/family about the products, and I just can't say yes to that. I am worried she will damage some relationships with friends of hers, and just be disappointed when she fails (If... I guess). technically it isn't a pyramid scheme, so any statement i make about how this isn't a good investment of her time and money is seen as me not believing in her.

Sorry for the length.  Hoping someone can help me know what to do.

 **TL;DR** My Partner (37F) has become a MLM distributor and I (32M) don't know what to do.  Technically it isn't a pyramid scheme, and she could obviously  be successful, but i also know what the odds are. How do i handle this? "
"Positive for Chlamydia, boyfriend yells whenever I express insecurity, and semen-like wet spots on the bed when I got home last night. Am I being crazy?


I am an extremely trusting person. So when I tested positive for Chlamydia one year into the relationship when I’ve only had one partner in the last year, I asked my doctor how. 2 months ago I started showing discharge and a smell so I got tested. At the very beginning of our relationship, I was having sex with 2 men (we weren’t exclusive). The other man tested negative while my boyfriend tested positive. She said that it was extremely unlikely that if my boyfriend had it going into the relationship, that I didn’t give it to the other man. She says it’s not impossible, but very unlikely. Still, I decide to trust him.

Then, I try to tell him what she said. He gets extremely defensive and loud, saying he trusts me and I should trust him, and that if I can’t trust him we shouldn’t be together. This conversation makes me feel insecure in the relationship. I let it go for a few days and try to bring it up again, that I am feeling insecure about this situation, and again get shouted down. This has happened 4 times. 

Then last night, I get home and there are wet spots on the bed. Like it seriously looks like semen and smells like semen. I ask him what they are and he starts shouting at me that I’m just being insecure and he can’t do this forever and he is sick of me accusing him of cheating???

It’s only been 2 weeks since the diagnosis. I’ve not dragged this on for months or anything crazy. 

Another important note is that he is friends with his ex. They FaceTime almost daily and she always says some weird off-color stuff, which I’ve always just chalked up to her being kinda weird. Yesterday when they FaceTimed, she said she was going on a date this weekend and wasn’t going to wear panties under her dress. I’ve always just trusted him and their friendship, but now I’m wondering if I’ve just been stupid. I’m best friends with my ex and I’m definitely not telling him about whether I’m wearing panties on a date. She makes jokes about him fucking her friends in front of her and she had her son call him step-daddy for a while (I put my down on that one, not fair to confuse a 3 year old). Her son cries for him all the time and won’t stop until they FaceTime, even though “they haven’t seen each other in person in over 1.5 years” per my boyfriend. When my brakes were going out, my boyfriend wouldn’t replace them. I asked for months. Her brakes went out and he went over there next day. Ok, no big deal, they’re just real close friends. I never wanted to get in the middle of it, ya know? I’ve always just kinda trusted it all. But now I can’t stop reading into it all. 

I don’t know guys. Part of me feels like I’m being crazy. The other part tells me I would be crazy by staying. So tell me, am I reading into this all too much? 

TL;DR Tested positive for Chlamydia and am now feeling insecure in the relationship because the other man I had sex with a year ago (during the beginning of my relationship) tested negative. Am I crazy for feeling this way? "
"My [22 M] girlfriend [22 F] and I are both graduating college soon. She will be attending a prestigious graduate program while I am not, and it is making me self-conscious.


We've been together for just under a year. 

For most of college, I was single, apathetic about everything, sat on my ass, and screwed myself into a 2.3 GPA. Meanwhile, she's kept up a 4.0 the whole time. She's always been an ambitious, career-driven go-getter, while I've been wasting time. 

This past year though, I've been trying to build myself back up and managed to bring my GPA to about a 2.8--which sadly, is still not enough for any decent Masters program. She's had multiple internships, extracurriculars, jobs, and leadership positions under her belt, whereas I have absolutely nothing. Absolutely. *Nothing*. No resume, no experience, no connections, nothing. Empty slate (and a low GPA to boot). I'm out looking for internships related to my major right now to make up for lost time--but I know I'm already extremely late to the game. 

Let's say I get an internship for the last 3 months of college. What next? Who would hire some guy who had 1 quick stint in 4 years of college? Exactly; no one. So I'm going to have to spend another 1 or 2 years looking for career-relevant volunteer positions and internships to have anything on my resume/CV. By that time she'd be holding an MA degree and I'd still be working a low-paying job.

She has strong family values (as do I) and cares greatly about education, and finding a good job. I know she would expect the same of me in the long run, and I don't plan to disappoint her or myself any further. We've both discussed this issue, and it's the one thing that she's worried about too. We're close friends who get along incredibly well and have a very healthy relationship otherwise. As challenging as it is, I want to be a good bf who knows what he's doing and can make her proud. It's never too late, I tell myself. Better late than never, I tell myself. But I can't seem to shake the feeling that I might already be too late. 

What do you make of this situation? 

TL;DR: My gf got accepted into her dream school, while I'm still looking for an internship. I'm trying to get my shit together ASAP, but sometimes I feel like I don't deserve her. Better late than never, but I'm not sure how to feel or what to do at this point. Sorry for the sob story. I guess I'd like to hear some reassurance from people who can relate, and tell me I'm headed in the right direction. "
"I [24M] overheard my parents [50sM&amp;F] speaking poorly about me and I'm hurt


Growing up we always had a great relationship. I was never a problem child, I did well in school, had a lot of hobbies and I recently landed a great job. I moved into my own apartment for about a year before moving back home to help them out around the house as both have varying degrees of physical impairment. I don't pay rent as I moved back in at their request, but I do pay for all of my own food and supplies and contribute towards the utilities I use. 

I took a personal day off work last week to just unwind, which is the first time I've done so after having moved back in. I was reading in my room when my parents came home. They had been having a rough couple of days arguing with each other and other life stress and almost as soon as they got in the door I could hear them. It wasn't anything they wouldn't argue about in front of me, so I didn't let them know I was home as it wouldn't have made a difference to them. 

Eventually they ended up by the stairs leading to the basement (where my bedroom is) and mom tells my dad to leave her alone. He apologizes, and out of nowhere she says ""you're still not half as bad as [my name]"". I then listen while my dad referred to me as a re*ard, a nuisance and all of my apparent bad qualities while my mom took turns with her own jabs, calling me lazy, saying she'd ""like to slap me"" and that sort of thing. Then they started laughing at my expense about my recent break-up and how apparently ""they might go at it like cats and dogs, but at least we know what commitment means!"" 

This went on for probably 3-4 minutes but it felt like an eternity. I eventually opened my door and closed it loudly and they instantly stopped talking. My mom called out to ask me if I was home. I went upstairs, gave them the utility money for this month and left my key. Dad couldn't even look me in the eye, my mom started crying and trying to touch my face and explain.

I've been staying at a friend's place and plan to get my own apartment again asap. Mom has left tons of voicemails explaining that they were just venting, they didn't mean it and begging me to talk to them.

I know that it seems biased as I'm the one writing, but I honestly haven't done anything to them to justify that. I thought we were always extremely close. I moved back in at their request, I work and help them with their bills and around the house. I don't understand, I wasn't even involved in their squabbles. I've never insulted my family to anyone, I'd never let someone talk poorly about them, yet my parents ""vent"" by using me as their punching bag when they think I'm not around. It just seems so cruel and unnatural. If It was a one-off remark I might get it but it wasn't and hardly seemed like the first time.

I guess I'm looking for guidance. I want to cut them off and not look back. I don't know if I can get past this and trust them again. Has anyone else dealt with this? I really don't know what to think or feel.

Tl;DR: Parents spoke poorly about me and betrayed my trust. Not sure what to do."
"Sister[24F] is upset that my[26M] proposal ring to my fiancee is similar to hers


I didn't propose to my fiancee and it's a sore point for her. Thus I promised I'd do a surprise proposal before our actual marriage.

After weeks of window shopping, I finally chose a ring that suited her. I've had female friends shop with me. I googled ring designs. I am certain this is THE ring for her.

Until I showed it to my sister today as I wanted her thoughts. She became upset and showed me her own proposal ring. To my astonishment, it was somewhat similar to the proposal ring I chose for my fiancee. She told me how ridiculous it was that I could get a proposal ring that looks exactly like hers and she insisted I change it. She gave me three reasons:

1) It's creepy I would get a proposal ring just like hers

2) She wants her ring to be unique. It's lost it's uniqueness now that I have a similar one

3) She thinks my fiancee would be upset if she sees how similar the rings are

Let me clarify - I never once examined my sister's proposal ring. Secondly, although I can see the similarities, a proposal ring is simply a diamond on a ring. It's inevitable that some designs would look alike. My sister admitted she is kinda unreasonable but she said she can't help it. It's becoming such a sore point for her that I have to ask you people - what makes this so bothersome for her? Should I do anything about this proposal ring?

**TLDR:** After a hell lot of effort, I finally chose a proposal ring for my fiancee. My sister became upset upon seeing it, saying it was too similar to hers. I agree it's somewhat similar but to me, they are still different rings. Sister insisted that I change my proposal ring. She admits to being unreasonable but she is so upset about the situation that I can't help but wonder why this is such a big issue for her. Should I do anything?"
"I (35m) am contemplating leaving my wife (35F) over a Tweet


So my friend comes for the weekend bc he’s going through a bad breakup. He was there for me 5 yrs ago when I had to deal with the same thing, so I thought it only fair to return the favor. My wife doesn’t like it when I stay out late with friends and I told her we would be home by 11. Around 1135 I had lost track of time and received an angry text from her. I apologized and came home immediately. After getting ready for bed I checked twitter and saw on her “anonymous” account which she has shown me a couple times, she posted the following: “Yes I do think to myself ‘I will definitely let someone ekse fuck me if you don’t treat me better.’ Sure I am fucked up. Kinda like your exes. #attachmentissues”

I confronted her about it and she has apologized profusely. Said she was just angry about me staying out late. I’ve been cheated on before in a previous relationship and it was devastating. Should I stay or should I go?

tl;dr I might leave wife over tweet threatening cheating"
"My GF [34] seems jealous of my little daughter [7]


I've been separated with the mom of my little girl for 1,75 years now.

&amp;#x200B;

For some months I'm noticing some red flags about my 4mths-GF. 2 months ago she dropped that ""we should be tougher"" on my little girl, even though she's not even bad/naughty or anything, she's just moody when it's about our relationship. Pretty normal stuff imo for a 7 year old that needs to adjust to a new person in her and my life.

From the moment my GF said that, I'm really on guard to never create a situation for my daughter where she could feel like it's 2 vs 1, so I will always be the one in the middle to be diplomat about anything.

&amp;#x200B;

So, yesterday, I'm doing the weekly call with my little girl to tell her good night for about 15-20min, and straight after the call my GF says ""Do you realise you've been saying goodbye for almost 10min now? And you tell her pet names much more than you do that to me, like you are much more in love with her than with me""

I was like... what? I didn't hear from my daughter for 7 days, and you're giving me this shit? She kind of backed off immediately, like she was feeling the waters how far she could go with it, although she did continue with ""I'm not jealous of her, but I just notice that you're not calling me pet names that much"". Which is BS. We constantly communicate with each other using pet names.

&amp;#x200B;

We had a fight, also about other minor stuff she dragged into it, and she asked to leave, so I did. Went to my place, and I didn't even care. Felt much more relaxed at my place afterwards.

&amp;#x200B;

\---

\*\*TL;DR;\*\* : My GF for 4 months is jealous about my 7 year old daughter because she thinks I'm calling her too much pet names."
"Unemployed Gf(34) is a serious strain on my(34) financial health. What is considered “enough” help?


Hi this is my first post, 
So my(34m) gf(34f) and i have been together for just over a year and living together for around 6 months.
Unfortunately for almost the entirety of our relationship she has been unemployed (not totally her fault) and the times she did get brief employment she used close to %100 of her salary paying her loans.
I have been paying all the bills including rent groceries and utilities and also paying for everything else couples do and servicing her car i also invested in jewelry for her to sell and keep the profits ehile returning my investment but she ended up not returning any money to me.
Lately she has been asking i pay towards her debt as she currently has no way of paying anything towards it and the debt collectors are calling her constantly.
I myself live frugally and favor financial security as i do not have anyone to turn to if things go bad (live in a foreign country) i buy very little for myself since i met her but make sure to pay all my bills and also pay for my 5 year old daughter from a previous relationship groceries and private school fees.
 I am getting to a point where her financial problems are causing me financial problems as she is draining my usual liquidity for savings and my own needs.
She also expressed concern over my skepticism and reluctance at buying her a car.
Am i supposed to be supporting her this much going forward while she is in a difficult time how far should it be allowed to go? 
I don’t want her to suffer but i feel like this is a life lesson she needs to learn about buying things on credit and loans that she cannot afford while gaining some financial responsibility in the process. 
Also i don’t feel like its fair that i and my daughter have to now suffer and sacrifice for her past financial choices. 
Really don’t want to be selfish or uncaring (am i?) but im really at a difficult point with this as it is affecting my own life goals and my ability to provide for my daughter.

Tl;dr
Girlfriends financial difficulties are quickly becoming my financial difficulties 
How much help is ok? "
"I [19f] think my friend [19f] is being taken advantage of by shady Christians students from her college. Is there something I can do?


My friend has had a… hard life. She was given away for adoption at birth, then adopted as a child (I believe at 7). Then her adopted mom died at 11 and her dad hasn't been really present in her life. We went through high school together, start to finish.

She would stay at our home most weekends. Her dad was mostly absent but sometimes bordered on abusive. After we went to college, we both came back home last Christmas break and she left in very bad terms with her dad, who is apparently an alcoholic now.

We Skype and chat a few times a week and she said she started going to church, ran into a few other students from college who were kind to her and introduced her to pastor who seems, unorthodox, at least the way I've perceived him and the way she talks about the students.

She says the students advised her to not share her beliefs with other Christians from school, as they would ""not understand"", whatever that means. They also invited her to go to the church the pastor owns/presides/whatever instead of the church she had been attending so far.

She said she has spoken to the pastor about how she's been feeling and she said the guy advised her against receiving formal therapy from the school mental health program.

I'm sorry for being so vague. I haven't gotten much info either. At first she would just mention church in passing, then she started talking about these other people and the more I ask her the more they give the wrong vibes.

I have asked what she thinks of them and she seems, ambivalent? Like she doesn't exactly know what to think of them but is still going along with them.

I'm not an expert but what I get from her is that she feels deeply alone at the moment and I think she's in a very fragile state and these people are, knowingly or not, manipulating her into going along with them, for whatever reason.

That's my guess, but I could be wrong. I hope I am.

Is there something I can do? How would know for sure? If she were in fact being manipulated, etc., how would I talk to her about it? Would she withdraw if I come off like I am accusing the students/priest of using her?

I care about her a lot and it hurts to think of people taking advantage of her, on top of all the shit she's already going through.

**tl;dr:** My friend seems depressed because of her broken family life, and has leaned on Christian students and a pastor that give me a bad vibe. How would be sure of my perceptions, and maybe support her somehow?"
"[Update]my gf (f24) wants to get engaged soon but I (29m) dont


Hey guys

First Id like to thank all all who commented on previous thread and helped out.
We sat down and I told her that Im not ready yet for that kind of a step. First she just listened and then said I quote;

""Then we are not going to have sex until you propose. I dont mind being without sex for months or more. Its up to you to show me how much you care for me""


I just stood up and went home. Didnt say a word. She texted me the next day saying how sorry she is for words she said and she didnt mean it. I still havent texted back cause honestly I dont what to write.

Here is link to original thread

Tl;dr she made an ultimatum saying we wont have sex until i propose, she texted me next day but I didnt respond yet"
"My [23F] boyfriend [27M] confessed he blurts out my name when feeling anxious?


My boyfriend and I have been together for 4 years. He recently told me, in a confession/nervous sort of way, that he has a habit of saying my name out loud when he's feeling anxiety. I asked more about it and learned that 1. He has to say my name out loud for it to work. 2. Saying my name stops the bad feelings and replaces them with good feelings he has about me 3. What triggers his anxiety in the first place is remembering awkward/embarrassing moments from earlier in the day/week, like fumbling with a handshake. 4. He doesn't do this in public/during work because he's distracted and keeps busy, so this mostly occurs when he's driving to and from work when he's alone with his thoughts. He then confessed he's had this habit since he was 7 years old. Before it was my name, it was his dog Dolly's, until he died 3 years ago. 


I'm surprised and a bit concerned to find this out only now. I also don't know how serious this is. I didn't judge and told him I'd simply look more into it. He's never googled it himself because he's scared of what it might mean.


We're very very close and I'm happy that I make him happy, but I also want to make sure I'm not brushing past an underlying issue. He's been dealing with feelings of low self-worth and social anxiety all his life. I've talked through a lot of this with him and we both used a lot of resources, books, even went to a therapy session to help. He knows he has a lot to live for but still deals with feeling low often. He socializes fine, it just takes a lot from him. On the bright side, he copes mostly in healthy ways like gym and stays distracted instead of sleeping. 


Is his ""coping habit"" something that needs to be looked into more? Are there healthier ways to take his mind off his anxiety?


TLDR: My bf blurts out my name to stop feelings of anxiety that creepy up when he thinks of embarassing/shameful moments. How healthy is this?"
"My [37M] wife [35F] gets frustrated when I want to make out without necessarily having sex. Am I wrong in wanting it? Is there a way to do it without her feeling frustrated?


I sometimes pull my wife randomly for a make out session. 1 to 4 minutes, nothing too long. It doesn't happen every day, more like every few days.

But she doesn't like it when it gets a little heavier without the release of sex. Last Saturday morning I was working on our room. I don't work from home or on weekends but there was a ton of stuff to do I said I'd work for a few hours and it'll lighten the load later.

I went down for coffee and she was washing dishes and I felt the desire to kiss her. I pulled her and we kissed for about 3 minutes. The petting got a little heavy and she was into really it. After I grabbed the coffee and was like ""well, off to work again!"" and she was like ""for real?"" and laughed incredulously. I said ""yeah?"" a bit confused as I didn't know exactly what she was feeling.

She said that she felt we didn't even had sex frequently enough (both work, 6 year old daughter, small business) for me to be teasing her and then just go off. And said this was something she had felt for a while now. I'm paraphrasing but she was serious and upset. I apologized and we sort of left it at that in the moment. She was a little grumpy the rest of the day (there were other reasons but feeling sexually repressed certainly doesn't help).

I mean, in the end we did have sex later, and she was felt much more refreshed, but I wonder, is it wrong that I ""tease"" with a make out session that does not lead immediately to sex? I mean to me that's just normal. I just want to kiss her and squeeze her a little bit for a few short minutes every now and then. Is that wrong? I personally don't think so.

I'd be lying if I tell you I don't get the rush for sex when we kiss, but I just see it as little windows for physical intimacy and that's that.

I'd like to talk to her about this but I first want to know if I'm doing something wrong or something? Would it be wrong to still want to have these little sessions if she say she doesn't like it? If she doesn't like it should I just stop even though I don't want to?

**tl;dr:** Wife doesn't like it that I ""tease"" her with make out and petting sessions that don't lead to sex. I like them but she feels frustrated. Am I wrong in wanting them?"
"Me [27F] with my supervisor [28F] 2 yrs - I have crohn's but my boss doesn't believe me


Hi. Sorry, this is long.

I have crohn's disease, which is messy and embarrassing. Having crohn's makes it difficult to work 9-5 in an office setting. Most of the time, I'm fine, but once a month or so, I will have a flare-up that is usually over within 1-2 days (due to accidentally eating something that my bowels don't like).

When I have a flare-up, that means I have severe diarrhea and pain and I'm shitting every 20-30 mins so I need to be near a toilet. This can result in ""accidents"" where I shit my pants if I can't get there fast enough. Going through this in an office setting is humiliating because of the noise and the smell, plus I have a really long commute (2 hours one way) and I have to carry lots of adult diapers which makes me feel SO embarrassed.

I have a full-time job, but it's a contract position. I requested accommodation to work from home 1-2 days a month that I could use in the event of a bowel flare-up. Originally, my supervisor was okay with it because I am a high performer and I'm the best analyst on the team. She wasn't thrilled, but agreed to grant it.

Now she's changed her mind. I got the flu last month, so I asked to work from home after I went to the doctor to get an inhaler. My supervisor flipped. She accused me of lying about having crohn's to get free days off. While I was waiting in the doctor's office, she was blowing up my phone with accusations about how she didn't believe I was sick because I wasn't online (I told her I was at the doctor... ?), how she thinks I've been lying all this time because ""no one gets sick that much"", and ""working from home is a privilege, not a right"" and how I abuse it.

I started crying right there in the doc's office because I had no idea my supervisor was harboring these feelings, and I was really sick and worn down and hurt that she thought I was lying for the past two years. I'm always available online when I am working from home and she can IM me, email me, or text me and I always reply within 5-10 mins (usually immediately). I thought this was fine because I was doing what she asked me to.

I'm good at my job. Other departments in the business request to work with me by name when we have to collaborate because they know I offer high-quality work. My only limitation is my crohn's. I don't think of myself as disabled because I CAN work, I WANT to work, I just need the accommodation to keep me functional.

I have doctor documentation for my diagnosis. But I'm just so hurt and horrified that my boss would accuse me of this. I live in a state with at-will employment which I guess means I can be fired at any time for any reason. I think I'll likely be fired soon.

I just don't know what to do. A few employers have been accommodating with my crohn's, but it's unfortunately common that others don't believe me. I'm so worn down and I can't keep getting fired. I need to make a living just like everyone else.

How can I navigate this situation with my boss? If I have to get a new job, how can I address my illness and need for accommodation so that I set myself up for success?

**tl;dr I have crohn's disease and need to work from home sometimes so I don't shit all over the office. My boss was okay with this but now revealed that she thinks I'm lying. Wtf do I do?**"
"My [29F] bridesmaid/""best"" friend [28F] is showing that she really isn't a friend at all.


Hi there, 

I'm at a total loss of what to do regarding one of my bridesmaids and I was hoping to get some advice from you all. 

My friend Kat, has been a good friend of mine for the last 7 years but we've always been friendly since we met in high school. When I moved away from our hometown to a major city about seven hours away, we still continued our friendship and would continuously talk/visit each other. We've been through a lot together and I considered her one of my best friends, until about two years ago when things started to get a little uncomfortable. 

Back about two years, she wanted to come visit my SO and I at our home in the city. We of course said yes and that's when she dropped the ""can my friend from grad school come too?"", despite us never having met her or heard about this girl. We still said yes, and to be short and sweet, this girl was a terrible houseguest - complained about our dog, made me super late for my new job because she wouldn't get out of bed (I drove them to the train station), and just was all around an annoying person. I had the feeling that Kat just wanted to show off that she knew someone in the city and try to impress this girl.

Ever since then, my relationship with Kat has started going downhill. She would only talk to me about problems with her grad school friends (rude houseguest included), invite herself over to my house whenever she ""had time off of work and could come down and see me"", and when she would come visit, it would be expected that I entertain her - take her out to restaurants, tour things in the city, etc. I would try to tell her that I needed to run my weekend errands and couldn't keep her busy, so she would start to pout and complain (again).

I tried to look past it because she was supposed to be my best friend. Then last year, I got engaged to my SO and she was so nonchalant about wedding talk. She would blatantly say she didn't care about X or change the subject or completely tune me out. So I began to instead turn to my other bridesmaids, who have been amazing and so helpful.

All of this brings me to my final point. Recently, my fiancé and I had to relocate back to our home state for a work opportunity. It was really hard to accept and I did not want to leave behind our life we had in the city, but all Kat cared about was that I was moving closer to her. She refused to acknowledge how hard it was for us, and kept getting angry when I wouldn't get excited like she wanted me to. Then she started realizing that she wasn't involved in the wedding planning as much (because she would not even RESPOND to texts!), and got even more mad. She keeps playing dumb when my other bridesmaids ask questions and they keep coming to me to complain about Kat.  

For the past two weeks, she has not been responding to my text messages or calls, and only did so when she wanted to come by our new place where I felt as if it was a grilling session. All she was doing was asking me questions without letting me go into a longer response. I even followed up afterwards asking if everything was ok and she never responded. 

I'm honestly not sure what to do and feel myself getting more and more frustrated. My fiancé tells me to just wait out her temper tantrum but I'm about ready to tell her to grow up.

Should I confront Kat? Or just wait this whole thing out? 

TD;LR - Bridesmaid is not only being totally useless and unresponsive, but a huge pain in my butt."

They recently were accepted and one of them will attend a university a few states away. They have always been super close so I would imagine this is hard for them.

Yesterday I went into one their rooms and they were both sobbing holding each other because they were so sad they wouldn't be able to see each other as often.

I tried to console them but they had pretty strong feelings about it so it didn't do much.

I don't know what to tell them, honestly. I didn't feel like this when my time came. I was already living only with my parents because my brother is several years older.

What should I tell them so they can be a bit more reassured or feel a little better moving forward?

"My Brothers(37M) Partner (35F) is repeatedly creating drama in our family. I have tried disconnecting from her in the past but my immediate family repeatedly tells me to brush everything she says off and ignore it. I'm angry how do I handle this when I feel muzzled in order to keep the peace.


 My brothers(37M) partner (35F) and mother of his 2 children (5f and 4f) have had a very tough relationship. I try not to pry and remind myself that it is their relationship and not mine. However throughout their relationship every time i have tried to be apart of my brothers life within days i get verbally attacked and put down. With the advice of my counselor i have tried to distance myself from her as much as possible. Recently my mother turned 60 and all she wanted was a family vacation like we used to go on(camping) I brought this up to my brother and her a year ago and they advised me to get dates and get back to them. After this my brother and his partner had some very rough months where there was police involved due to abuse from her side. This has made me bitter to say the least , my brother has decided to help her get help. Thats fine and again i understand this is not my relationship. Because of this my brother had asked that any planning of events involving him and the children go through him. So when i was finalizing dates and booking cottages i only contacted my brother, due to some other major family events going on this summer and availability it left us with one week. My brother approved it and i booked this week(booked /paid for in January for cottage week at end of June). She was invited to go to Ireland with my estranged aunt and this would be during the week of the family vacation - my brother assured me it was ok and they would still be coming (brother, 2 daughters). Yesterday I got a scathing text message and voicemail advising me i was childish and rude and should think of the children and properly consult with people prior to making these arrangements. As well that i should not be contacting my brother to make plans for the family because it is her job not his. I responded back in an honestly passive aggressive manner but said i had already done the consulting in the manner i was advised. This has now blown up to her telling me i'm selfish uncaring and the cause of all the drama in my family. Some other choice words and attacks were used as well. I spoke with my brother and father (they were together at the time) who have asked me to just brush it off. I'm not sure how to do this anymore and at what point is it ok for me to stand up for myself and my family ? 

TL;DR: Brothers partner verbally attacks me , family asks to brush it off- i need help i don't know how to anymore"
"My [23F] best friend's [23F] boyfriend [25M] just told me he wants to propose in 5 months. She has specifically told me she wants to wait longer. He doesn't believe me. What do I do?!


My best friend (BFF) lives in a different state and she and her boyfriend (BF) have been together about 8 months. They moved in together after 6 months of long distance dating. I've always had my concerns about them moving too fast but it's her life and she seems so sure that this is her soulmate, so I'm trusting her (it's also her first long term boyfriend - I know - but you can only tell someone to be careful so many times).

BF texted me tonight telling me he wants to propose in 5 months and asked me to help with getting specific ring ideas and figuring out how she would want to be proposed to. I responded saying I was extremely excited but that I think he may be rushing things, that I've had specific conversations with BFF about her ideal timeline and that she would like to wait a little longer to give the relationship more time, and also to work through some communication/listening issues they've been having.

BF basically responded coldly saying ""thanks for your input but that's when I want to do it"". I tried to kindly say that she's specifically told me she's on a different timeline and he should respect that and he responded ""I know how happy we are and how our relationship is right now. We are very happy. I just need to you figure that stuff out for me please. We have talked about the timeline many times we are on the same page.""

For more context about these conversations, BFF has told me she wants to marry BF but that he doesn't listen to her or remember specific things she has asked him to do, and sometimes they don't communicate the best. She 100% talks to him about this and they are working through things, but she's specifically told me that she doesn't want to get engaged until they've figured these specifics out. BFF has VERBATIM said ""I know he wants to get engaged late summer but I would really prefer closer to late winter"" so I know I'm not crazy here.

I'm concerned BFF has been dishonest with him about her ideal timeline and has told him what he wants to hear. I obviously can't just tell her up front that she should talk to him honestly about his timeline, because she has no idea that he's asked me to do this in the first place and I don't want to give it away. I'm also concerned about the way he responded to me and wasn't even willing to entertain the idea that his future fiancee would prefer to get engaged later, coming from her closest friend.

&amp;#x200B;

HOW DO I FIX THIS?!

&amp;#x200B;

tl;dr: my best friend's boyfriend of 8 months reached out to me, wants to propose in 5 months &amp; asked for my help. She's told me she wants to wait longer than that. He didn't believe me when I told him. How do I fix this and not ruin the surprise engagement or the relationship?"
"Me [36 M] with my gf [40 F] of five months, has been checking on me through the app we met on and accused me of cheating


I got out of an abusive marriage about a year ago, and started dating someone I met on a dating app about five months ago. Everything seemed to be going really well, and she was understanding about certain parts of my life, i.e. when I had my kids I wouldn't be seeing her.

She sent me a text the other day asking if we could talk about some concerns she had. We spoke and the run down was that she had been checking on me through that app we met on and thought I was still using it to meet other women because my profile was still there. She also said that the location it kept showing was concerning to her. I had deleted the app from my phone maybe after a week of us meeting, really hadn't thought of it from then on. I felt pretty violated that she was doing this. She thought I was repeatedly going to a city I haven't even been to in months.

I explained to her that I had deleted the app and that I hadn't thought to actually delete the profile. It seems pretty hypocritical that she is was getting upset about this, when she has not told me she never deleted her profile, or the app from her phone. It even came out that she still has multiple dating apps on her phone with open profiles.

In our conversations that we have had since, she has said a couple other things that really bothered me about my ex controlling my life and the quality of my friends.

Am I out of my mind for thinking this is a pretty significant line to cross? My gut feeling is that I should end the relationship over this.

tl;dr The girl I've been dating has been checking up on me through the dating app we met on, and accused me of cheating "
"I (22F) do not want to move in with (23 M) BF. Him and his family keep pushing the subject.


 So I am a 22F and about to graduate this spring, with a job lined up. I plan on getting my own place. My original plans were to get my own place and start my own career, as my boyfriend (23M) will still be in school one more year. 

Ever since I told my family and his family about my new job and plans to get an apartment, different people have been assuming that we would move in together. I try to clarify that no, it's going to be MY apartment, and explain that he's still in school. Then various people are acting salty because I dont have plans to move in with him anytime soon, and they give me unwarranted relationship advice. 

For example....
His parents make jokes about how now I can support and care for him now that I'll be starting a career. Just today, his dad went on to even talk about my personal thoughts on marriage and that if I was so ""stuck on being married"" we could ""just save money and elope"". I told his dad ""this has nothing to do with marriage"" but he continued to talk over me! My boyfriend fed the conversation, and made it sound like I wouldn't let him move in because I wanted to get married first (not true!!). When I tried to explain that I'm young, want my own place for awhile, and want to live somewhere convenient for me, no one would listen and just talked over me. 

Later on, when we were alone, I told my boyfriend that I dont like getting unwarranted relationship advice from his dad. Then i asked, ""are you really that upset because I dont want to live with you for awhile??"" He just grumbled and said something like ""yeah kinda"". 

I clarified to him, that it doesn't make sense to have him live with me and commute further to school. It has nothing to do with marriage or some religious reason (I'm not religious). He still wasnt happy with my answer and changed the topic. 

My boyfriend assumes that my parents' religious views are the reason why I dont want to live together, regardless of what i tell him.

The reason why I dont want to live with him right away is because I want to have my own place for a little while! I dont want to support and pay for him to finish school! I want to see him grow up a little bit and figure his life out and not rely on me to do it for him. Also, I dont think it makes any sense for him to commute long distances to school when he can live at home with his parents and save money. 

Lately I just feel like everyone is pushing me to either get married when I clearly dont want to (and waaaaay too young/not ready), or let my boyfriend move in with me this summer and support him! How do I go about this situation?? Clearly explaining my thoughts on this isn't helping. Clearly, my boyfriend is also talking about it to his parents on what he THINKS is my reasoning, making me look like the bad guy. I'm so frustrated! I feel like my achievements are turning into excuses to ""settle down"" when I'm not ready to. 

TL;DR I feel like because I am starting a new career and moving out people are using it as a reason for me to settle down or move in with my boyfriend, which I don't want. My boyfriend and his family ate acting annoyed with me and giving me unwarranted relationship advice. "
"Friend and I are moving in together, but a third friend is trying to join in on it. We don’t want her living with us


Hi hi! I’m on mobile so sorry about the usual stuff.
This is also a throwaway account.

So my friend and I are planning on finding a place together in a few months. We both work in the same area, and I’m sick of commuting so far to get to work and she’s sick of living alone so it works perfectly and she’s one of the more trustworthy and reliable of all of my friends.

The problem is that we met through a mutual friend who we have both been very close with for years. While we both love her to death she is probably the least responsible person either of us know. She will bail on everything from simple hangouts to shifts at work. She’s made both of us look bad at our jobs from not showing up to appointments and caused way more inconvenience than I think she realizes. Everyone who’s ever tried to make plans with her can say the same thing. She’s also notorious for borrowing things and either never giving them back, or giving them back wrecked (she recently returned a sweater I had let her borrow at least 5 years ago, but it had stains on it.) Not to mention how disorganized and messy she is.

Very recently though she got a job in the city and now she’s constantly talking about the three of us finding a place together. My friend and I that have been looking at places haven’t told her that we were doing so yet because we weren’t sure how she would react, but now it’s even harder. We both agree that she would make a terrible roommate, and we were planning on backing it up by telling her it’s because she doesn’t have a steady job, but now that she does (and so close to both of ours much less) we’re having an extremely hard time navigating this.

Part of me is thinking about giving her the benefit of the doubt and bringing her along in our home search, but my gut is telling me she doesn’t belong in a home with us.
I know we should just be adults and tell her straight up that just the two of us want to live together, but we don’t want to risk hurting her feelings or losing her as a friend.

Any advice or insight would be greatly appreciated!

We are all 20F by the way

TLDR- Friend and I are getting a place together in a few months, but our unreliable friend has been trying to get in on it in the past few weeks. We don’t want her living with us but also don’t want to offend her."
"My (25f) boyfriend (38m) just told me he lied to me about his ex-wife being dead


I've been dating him for a while now. He's a single dad of two kids and I thought his ex-wife was dead this whole time from childbirth. It turned out to be his child who died, not her. I've been around his kids and his house, and she's pretty much out of the picture because she basically abandoned her kids since she couldn't handle being a stay at home mom. They are divorced now. 

&amp;#x200B;

Supposedly he was worried he'd scare me off with his situation and then the lie spiraled out of control and he just confessed it to me now as things are getting serious. He said he was so scared of losing me that he never confessed to it and it just kept getting out of control. 

&amp;#x200B;

He'd cry over her saying he misses her when he drinks but he says that's because he couldn't say he missed his child so he replaced it with her name. Things like that. It seemed like such a major part of his life and now to find that its a lie is a bit...weird.

&amp;#x200B;

 I love him a lot, I do, but this seems like such a major lie to me. I'm not sure if this is the type of lie that means I should be reconsidering things, but he says it doesn't impact the way he feels for me and doesn't impact our relationship or future plans at all because she's basically not involved in their lives anymore. And that he kept the lie going because he was scared of losing me and understands if I leave now.  I don't know how to feel about this. Is this almost as bad as being cheated on because it's such a big lie? I don't know what to do or feel. Is it a good idea for me to end this or should I give it a chance? Please advise.

  
TL;DR: Bf lied about wife being dead in place of having lost a child and I don't know what to do"
"I (23F) found out my husband (31M) has been pretending to be homeless instead of getting a job.


I don't understand why he's like this. Does he just not care? We've been together for more than three years and have a child turning one in a few weeks, and he still hasn't gotten a job. Meanwhile I have two and used to work three before I had our daughter. AND I'm taking classes for a certificate in my field.

He went to college, graduated with honors, so it's not like he has no motivation or can't succeed. So what gives?

Anyway I found out he was lying to me by literally being on a bus that went past him at an intersection. Downtown, broad daylight. He's been out there every day for who knows how long while I'm at work. I just happened to leave early today. He told me he'd been going to the library to apply for jobs and attend some free coaching sessions. He's put some real damn effort into the whole schtick, there was a cardboard sign and old ratty clothes and everything to make him look the part.

Yes I know that misrepresenting yourself like this is panhandling and it's a crime. He would, it seems, prefer to risk jail and a criminal record than get a job. He'd rather willingly take up the indignity of BEGGING ON THE STREET than earn money by being employed.

On top of this, I had to force the truth out of him. I gave him a chance to explain and he maintained his lie about the library. I had to tell him I had witnessed it before my eyes this afternoon before he confessed.

Oh, and what is he doing with the change he swindles out of strangers you ask? Does he put it towards household expenses, or things for our child, or at least save it? Nope! He blows it away on buying himself fast food. I'm furious because a few months ago he told me he was going to cut back on the amount of junk he ate. He PROMISED he'd change his diet. Now I find out that out of all the things he could be spending this money on, it's fast food. He eats it out of the house so I never would have known.

I just don't understand it. He is perfectly capable, physically and mentally, of holding a job. Why he refuses to is beyond me at this point. I mean if having a baby wasn't enough of a reason to stop fucking around for youtube all day and do something useful, what else could be?

I'm so damn tired of nagging him. He's tired of having me nag. But I plain don't trust him to take the responsibility on his own. I thought he was finally stepping up to the plate. Turns out that was just another false hope.

The way I see it is, we are partners, in support of each other and of our family. I'm doing my share for that and he isn't.

I'm just unbelievably disappointed. I'm starting to think he simply won't ever change.

Has anyone dealt with something like this? How did/would you handle it with your partner?

TL;DR: Wife fed up with husband who has resorted to posing as a beggar to avoid having a job.

"We're caring for my sister's children while she receives inpatient psychiatric care. Their father/her husband is no help, neither is my unemployed brother. All the work is falling to those with the most to do in their own lives. Help.


 

TL;DR: (Basically the title) My sister is finally getting the inpatient care she needs for her bipolar depression. My mother and my family are running ourselves into the ground caring for her children and trying to tend to our own lives while their father/my brother-in-law goes to work and plays video games. My unemployed brother is next to no help. I don't know how to manage everything and am afraid of how things will look moving forward. Keeping in mind I can only control my own behavior, how can I be there for my nieces while maintaining my own boundaries?

&amp;#x200B;

Last week my sister (29f) checked into an inpatient psychiatric unit to get help with her bipolar depression. She came to the town where most of her family lives so that we could care for her 6-year old and 7-month old daughters while she gets the help she needs. My partner (27m), our son (4m), and I (27f) just moved out of my mom's (64f) basement the week before. My brother (35m) is still living with our Mom. My sister left her husband (34m) at home so that he could continue going to work (I think he's used his timebanks up).

The brunt of the care has been split between my Mom and my partner and me. My Mom works full time at a demanding profession, my partner works full time at an office job (which he's already had to take a day off of to make all of this work), and I am in graduate school on the weekends and work part time. We also have a 4-year-old son. I'm writing this during class- I'm distracted and sleep deprived. My brother has helped when he's *needed* to, but always begrudgingly. He doesn't work or go to school or do much other than play video games.

My partner and I have been up all hours of the night with the baby every night since they got here (the 6 year old has been staying with my Mom while the baby has been staying at our place). The other night my Mom woke up in the middle of the night to use the bathroom and found my brother playing League of Legends with my sister's husband at 3 a.m. The two of them (her husband and our brother) have a video game addiction in common, and neither one of them seem to do anything but the bare minimum in their lives. Her 6-year old daughter has learned to comfort and care for her mother when she has depressive episodes because her husband just acts like it's all a grand inconvenience on his life. To top it all off, my 6-year-old neice and I have a really close bond and anytime I've cared for her (this isn't the first time I've been asked to step-in or supplement her care) her father gets very defensive and acts like I'm trying to steal his kid. It may be worth mentioning that he has three previous children to three different mothers- only one of which he now has a relationship with- because my sister went out of her way to foster it.

Half a year ago when my neice was born my partner, Mom, and I spent a lot of time cleaning their house-trying to get it to smell less like cat piss, and watching kids. At one point, my brother-in-law came in as we were all cleaning and began playing video games, I told him that his behavior was unacceptable, and he either needed to help with cleaning or go be with my sister (who had legitimately almost died following her C-section- saying it was a difficult labor is an understatement). He whined to my sister that I'd called him out, she called and yelled at me for ""creating drama."" ...I'm not sure if I'm including this part just to vent, or to give ya'll some more context, but it's a good illustration of the relationship dynamics.

I don't know how long she'll be in the Psych unit, and I don't know what is going to happen when she gets out. She and her husband are talking about allowing their home to be foreclosed on, declaring bankruptcy, and moving to the town where the rest of our family is. The only thing I **do** know is that she's not going to leave him (a decision she's toyed with for years) because, as she said, she's ""not in a mental space to make that sort of decision right now.""

I'm so angry with my brother and brother-in-law... I'm exhausted, as is my partner, Mom, and all the kids. My son was already adjusting to a move and is now also dealing with a baby in the house. He's handling it very well, but it's a lot and, as much as I love my neices, he is my priority. Furthermore, the progress we've made getting settled into our new apartment has essentially stopped, so our home is disorganized and chaotic. As I mentioned, my partner has missed work (which he can reasonably manage because he's responsible with his timebanks, but that's time that we've been saving to spend on our own family/potential crises), and I'm struggling to find the time to do assignments, let alone actually *learn* anything this term (the fogbrain is real).

I want to help my sister. She is really struggling and has been for a long time. I'm proud of her for getting help. But I'm **so** angry. When I said something minorly dispairaging of my brother-in-law, my brother responded like I was being a drama queen. I feel like crying 85% of the time. I want to have boundaries and protect my own family, but I also need to be there for my neices. I know that I can't control anyone else's behavior, and trying to get my brother or my brother-in-law to act like adults just feels like misplaced energy that I don't have to spare. Trying to get my sister to leave her husband is **definitely** misplaced energy.

I have no idea what to do. I know we can't keep on in this way."
"SO [30M] confessed that he is not physically attracted to me [22F]


We’ve known each other for 2 years, started dating a year ago. Our relationship has been amazing. 

A few days ago, we were having intercourse while he was drunk. He asked me if I would consider getting a breast reduction surgery, while laughing, so I assumed he was joking. The next day, I confronted him about it. He told me he was sorry, he was just really drunk, didn’t mean it, etc. I bugged him about it until he told me the truth. He said that he isn’t really attracted to my body. I found out I’m completely the opposite of what he’s into (he prefers petite, I’m curvy). He also said that this is the reason why he likes having the lights off while we have sex. 

I’m hurt and my confidence will likely never be the same. He assured me that this doesn’t change anything and he’s still very much in love with me. He feels so guilty and I know it was never his intention to hurt me. However, I’m not sure I can get past this. Can this relationship even work if you’re not physically attracted to your SO? 

Tl:dr; SO admitted I’m not his ideal body type. I am questioning whether this relationship will work."
"New term of endearment all of a sudden, feels awkward to ask!


TL;DR - Partner of 2 years has never used terms of endearment or nicknames, suddenly started to do so a month ago.

This feels like a weird one, but I’m so curious about it and I don’t want to ask him and make him feel self conscious!

So I’m female, late twenties, he is male mid thirties. We’ve been together for two years. We don’t live together, due to the circumstances of both our jobs at the moment, but that’s the plan in the next year or two.

We are both relatively formal British southerners (he is slightly posher than me) and not really big fans of ‘honey, sweetie’ type terms of endearment, although I’ll drop them in occasionally. He never has, though. He is a loving and kind person but he will generally just call me by my name.

A few weeks ago though, I’d come back from a night shift and was speaking to him on the phone, and when I said goodbye he said ‘Sleep well, my love’. Since then he has occasionally dropped ‘my love’ at the end of sentences when he’s being affectionate, and it’s only strange because he has never ever done it before.

Am I being odd? There’s a chance I’m just being odd. He was married before we met, and I don’t know if this is something he used to say to her which is creeping in now that we’ve been in our relationship for a solid amount of time? It doesn’t particularly worry me, I’ve just not known it to happen before."
"I(25f) DESERVE to be yelled at by my bf(28m) of 3 years.


Wtf honestly. Please tell me what you think of this.

TL;DR down at the bottom

I helped him trim his beard yesterday and he didn't say thank you and implied I did a bad job. ( I'm a barber so I'm pretty sure I'm capable, done his beard for 3 years) 
I got a bit upset and went into the bedroom from the bathroom..He came in after a bit and asked what was wrong. I calmly said I felt it was rude of him to imply something and should have said thank you instead of having an attitude. He said OK angrily and started to leave the room. I asked if that was all he was going to say?

And then the massacre started. All of a sudden he was yelling really loudly and telling me I'm being ridiculous. And he doesn't get how I am upset over something like that and I'm being an idiot. 
I was very surprised I was getting yelled at for saying how I feel and said I don't understand, why you are so angry, can't you just see my point of view? I was calm but pretty scared because he was slamming things(oven door,he had started making himself food) and just completely twisting the situation.
He then took his plate to the couch area and I was standing a bit further away(small 1 bedroom apt..) He kept on yelling stuff and honestly I don't even remember all of it. 
I said again, why are you yelling, please try to take my feelings into account? I just told you how I felt, how is that wrong? And then he screamed it:

YOU DESERVE TO BE YELLED AT. YOU LEAVE ME NO OTHER OPTION!

He also at some point said I always accuse him of everything and said Fuck I'm getting so angry at you and ushered me away with his hand...like get the fuck out of my face kind of way(literally it was so bad I shut down..He did a thing with his hand as if I was a servant or something.) ...And kept yelling and telling me I'm crazy for getting upset over stupid things like this and how do I even have these dumb feelings and to go fuck myself.


I started crying at the DESERVE part, he was basically saying everything he knew would hurt me. I screamed WTF at the top of my lungs and he stopped yelling..I went to the bedroom and hid under a blanket and cried. I don't understand how I deserve this. I only said my opinion and calmly explained my reasoning for being a little upset/annoyed.


After a few hours he came in and said I'm sorry I said go fuck yourself. I said I think there are a lot of things you should apologise for. He said he Stands By most of what he said and doesn't get how I act like this.

I'm deeply concerned. I thought he was coming in to apologize for everything and tell me he is sorry and explain what he did wrong. I basically said do you think you should apologise for this or that..and some of it he apologized for but mostly not AND THEN ACTED LIKE EVERYTHING WAS FINE. I was still crying and panicking (I couldn't comprehend how he still blamed me) I feel like I gave him no other option, but to say the words..I don't think he meant them.


He has done this before.I get upset over something he doesn't understand and he starts yelling and screaming and slamming things instead of trying to understand my emotions and where I'm coming from. He has also threatened to leave me if I don't stop starting fights. HE ALWAYS SAYS I STARTED THE FIGHT AND IT'S MY FAULT.

I'm at a loss. He acted like everything was fine after and was trying to cuddle me and said I needed to stop crying and get some sleep and was being sweet and asked if I wanted to get my back scratched to fall asleep ( I have anxiety and panic attacks so he helps me fall asleep regularly)


I want to know what you think? I'm starting to believe I deserve this behaviour. I'm completely at a loss on how to act and what to do? He is acting like everything is fine this morning.


TL;DR My boyfriend says I deserve to be yelled at and blames me for acting ridiculous. Is he abusive?"
"I [24f] am planning on ghosting my soon to be ex boyfriend (31m). Together 5 years


I’ve decided to ghost my soon to be ex-boyfriend, and I’d like some feedback on whether or not this is the best idea. 

We’ve been together for almost 5 years, and the last 2 years have been hell. I realized about a year ago I was in a really shitty relationship and thought it would be possible to save it, it’s wasn’t possible. 6 months ago I realized I was in a dangerous situation and need to escape as quickly as possible. I don’t think it’s necessary to go over the finer points of the relationship, but I’ll add a bullet point list of events that have happened in the past 2 years of why I think it’s best for me to just breakup by ghosting. 

* He hasn’t paid for anything over the past 2 years. Refuses to pay his share of the rent, won’t help pay other bills, I end up having to buy him gas, cigarettes, alcohol, meds, doctor visits, etc etc. He spends his money on food, drinks and video games. He will get angry when I ask for help financially, he has literally thrown cash in my face on several occasions when I asked for help to pay a bill. 


* I feel like I’m constantly walking on eggshells around him. Anything I say or do could trigger a fight, sometimes the fights are over the most banal things - like I moved his keys to the key-hook thing by the front door, or I forgot to buy X item at the grocery store, or if I picked us up burgers for dinner will yell at me for forgetting to ask they remove the pickles, etc. He screams at me during these fights, makes me feel awful, pushes me to apologize before he drops the issue. This happens almost daily. 


* Note about his screaming - he will use his loudest voice possible to yell at me, he will punch himself while yelling me, he will scream inches away from my face and back me into a wall or corner in our apartment. This happens several times a week. 


* He gaslights me constantly. There have been more times that I can remember where I thought I was literally losing my mind. He’s really really good at lying and making things seem believable. I started keeping a secret journal of events to prove to myself I wasn’t crazy. One example - I would try to always put my keys on the key hook by the front door so I wouldn’t have to search for them before work. He would hide my keys when I wasn’t around and claimed he didn’t move them. I had to make mental notes about putting the key on the hook, and then making a note in my journal of the time and day of when i put my keys on the hook. But, when I went to the hook to grab my keys, they were gone. And I found them in a weird place where I knew I didn’t place them. He always denied placing them there, and would get angry when I accused him. That’s just one example, I could list 100 other events where he has gaslighted me. 


* He gets drunk everyday, I’m 110% sure he’s an alcoholic but won’t admit it. He lies about being drunk even though I can see that he is clearly intoxicated. He conveniently “forgets” the horrible things he has done to me b/c he uses being drunk as an excuse. He will drink from morning till night. A mix of anything he can get, lately it’s some cheap clear alcohol that comes in a plastic bottle and smells like rubbing alcohol.


* Pretty sure he’s doing coke, or some other upper. I’ve googled the signs of coke users and he hits a lot of the marks, but I can’t prove it or really know for sure. He’s denied using drugs. 


* He frequently throws things when he is angry or drunk, or an angry drunk. Since he is an alcoholic there are always an ample number of beer bottles and other alcohol bottles lying around. It started with him throwing those at a wall, it has now escalated to him throwing them near me. We have one wall that is all brick in the apartment, the other week he threw a glass bottle while I was standing at this wall. He may have been aiming for me, but it hit the wall about a foot away from me, and glass shattered everywhere. There have been many times where he throws something at this brick wall and glass shatters everywhere. I have been wearing flip flops constantly in the apartment b/c vacuuming hasn’t been enough to get all the shards out of the carpet. 


* When he isn’t angry, he talks down to me constantly. He makes me feel ugly, stupid and worthless. I’m extremely depressed and it’s getting to the point where I wake up in the morning and I’m disappointed I woke up. 


* He still wants to have sex with me. I don’t want to have sex with him. He gets angry when I start to refuse sex, so I give in. I try to pretend I’m asleep, he’ll still go for it. If I lie there with my eyes closed and not moving he gets angry because I’m not in to it. 


* He deliberately embarrasses me in front of our friends. He’ll come up with a story that has a grain of truth to it about what happens in our private life and shares it with my friends. Example: I was up for about 36 hours straight, due to not sleeping and working multiple jobs, and taking one evening class. I ended up sleeping until about 2-3pm one day, and told the story to my friends as if I were lazy. He claimed he was ok with me sleeping late because he does all of the chores anyway so there isn’t anything for me to do. 


* He eats all the food. I’ve lost a lot of weight, I’m borderline underweight right now because I probably only eat one meal a day. And I try to snack when I can. I’ll make something big like a lasagna, I’ll get to have one hearty portion the day it’s made. But, he ends up eating it while I’m asleep or at work and I come home and it’s gone. He’s gained a lot of weight. This happens with most food I bring home or make. I don’t have a lot of money so buying food at fast food places isn’t always an option. My saving grace for not starving to death is a guy who works as a fast food style Mexican food place likes me, and will usually give me my meal for free when he’s working.  He has no idea the impact he has on my life I at least get a 1000 calorie meal 2-3 times a week for free. 

So…yeah. Everything I mentioned is pretty shit. I hate him so much, I don’t care what happens to him. I literally hope the worst in life happens to him, he’s such a horrible human. He deserves everything bad that happens to him from now on.

I should note he's usually unemployed and just plays video games all day and hangs out with his friends and drinks. 

I just want to escape. I don’t care about his reaction to me ghosting him will be. I’ve planned my escape for the past few months now. My parents moved to a new house a little less than a year ago, my soon to be ex doesn’t know they have moved. I lied to him about the day the lease ends (my name is the only one that is on it). I’ve told him I’m moving back in with my parents and the lease is ending soon. And he needs to get his things out by March 15. He actually listened to me this time. I’ve made it seem like I’m actually moving, I borrowed a bunch of boxes and tubs, and I’ve packed up the majority of the apartment. His car is packed up and has a few things inside to last him until tomorrow when he leaves. Once he leaves I’m never speaking to him again. I’m going to change my phone number, he doesn’t know where my parents are currently living (as I’ll have to live with them for awhile to save up all the money I’ve lost and pay off the debt he has caused me), he will be blocked from every social media platform I’m on. My friends already hate him, so they have my back. My parents also live about 2 hours away from me, unfortunately this soon to be ex’s mom lives in the same city as my parents. 

What else should I do or can do to protect myself? Am I doing the right thing by ghosting him? 

**tl;dr** My soon to be ex is a horrible and violent human. I’m planning on ghosting him and have taken a few steps to make sure he can’t find me. I want to make sure I’m making the right decision and if there is anything else I can do to protect myself and hide from him. "
"My (F23) partner (M30) of two years doesn't do his share of caring of our dog (1year)


Me and my partner have a one-year old dog together.  Unfortunately, he is not really doing a good job with our dog.

&amp;#x200B;

First of all, he is very irresponsible:

Although we have no control over her (our dog), he will let her run around loose. She will not come back when called (only 30% of the time), and she goes to greet all the other dogs. We have had cases where the other dog was aggressive and their owner got really stressed because our dog was running towards it. She is superfriendly, but it doesn't change the fact that other dogs should be respected. We have had times where I have gone out with her on a leash, and my partner have grabbed the leash and let her loose.

&amp;#x200B;

He never takes the dog into consideration when planning the day. I try to tell him that letting our dog be home alone for TEN hours is NOT okay, just because he thought it would be more ""practical"" for him to go directly from work to visit a friend afterwards. He doesn't communicate with me the plans - he just expects me to take care of her because that is what I have done all the time. If I don't, he will simply let her be home alone for 8-10 hours and say that ""she is just a dog, she is fine"". YES, she is probably fine BUT why make her hold her bladder for that long and be bored at home if you can just plan your day a little bit more your dogs needs?

&amp;#x200B;

When she was sick, I was the one to take her to the vet. I was the one to pay for all of it. Why? Because he can't even make time for stuff like that when it matters. 

&amp;#x200B;

We have an arrangement now where I walk her in the morning, and he walks her in the evening before bed. All the walks inbetween depends on who is available (but usually it's me). 50% of the days, he tries to argue with me about why he has to take her out. He feels like it's not fair, because he wants to go to bed. This is after he has played video games for maybe four hours, and keeps nagging about how he is tired and has to go to bed and its unfair that I just go and brush my teeth and go to bed and leave him with the ""job"". BUT I DO IT IN THE MORNING FOR GODS SAKE, I DON'T ARGUE WITH HIM EVERY TIME I TAKE HER OUT.

&amp;#x200B;

This has caused a lot of arguments between us. He keeps saying I'm being a ""helicopter-parent"" every time I ask him to take her out for a walk (I want to let her out more often when we are at home - just because it is more fun and convenient for her. He says its unneccessary and will rather do the bare minimum), and every time I tell him that letting her loose is not okay because we have a responsibility as dog owners.

&amp;#x200B;

After seeing how uncaring and how little responsible he is with our dog, I feel like having a kid with him would be even worse. It has ruined how I feel about him and I don't know where to go from here.

&amp;#x200B;

Tl:dr;  partner doesn't do his share when it gets to our dog. Will only do the bare minimum, and still then argue about having to do just that. Is very irresponsible; will let her loose although we have no control over her. It's taking a toll on our relationships, and I don't know if I want to have kids with him anymore.

"Why does he (M26) still have Tinder despite me (F25) asking him to delete it?


We’ve been together about 3/4 months now. This is one of the strangest relationships I’ve been in.

Things started off really fast, in 2 weeks he asked me out and in 3 said he loved me. Despite this clearly being a warning sign, I just assumed he was really into him and I was also into him so we hit it off. He soon started talking about marriage and kids, I made it clear I won’t consider it until a few years go by. 

So before he asked me out, we had phone convos for hours every night. He said he loves my personality and how we click. Since dating him a few months, I’ll be lucky if he sends a few texts a day and our chats last about 10/20 mins. He usually finds an excuse and says he’ll call back (says in 15 mins) but calls back hours later, despite being on social media and not being busy. 

Anyway, about a month after we were official, my single friend spots him on Tinder and sends me a screenshot. We’ve both deleted the app in front of each other.

I bring this up in a phonecall and he gets mad to the point where he hangs up. Refuses to pick up when I call. Through messages, he denies this has anything to do with him and it was probably hacked. I went onto tinder myself and saw that on the matches “feed” he uploaded several pics only a few days ago, also updated his bio 1 day ago. He refuses to admit it again, even though I know he did it. He went as far as saying he got hacked or his friends done it. Even sent me a screenshot asking them if they logged in on his account. Then he said “wouldn’t you feel stupid if they said yes?”.

They didn’t, because he was the one who did it. He even made a common spelling mistake in his bio that he always does in his texts. After going back and forth, I was tired and gave up. About 10 mins later, he apologises and confesses to uploading the pics. But absolutely swears he didn’t do the bio. I just say fine and let go.

I deleted my tinder account (not just the app) because I knew I would only check back on him and get paranoid. He pleaded me to trust him so that’s what I did and said he won’t use the app ever again. About a week later, he finally said he did change the bio, because he wanted to use it for finding friends and was embarrassed by it. I didn’t quite understand, because Tinder isn’t for making friends. He agreed and said he deleted the app for good, won’t use it again. 

Another month or so passed, I was talking to a work colleague about us and showed her his fb pic. She said she recognised him from Tinder, even showed me they matched but there were no messages. Again, I brought this up in a phone call to him. He got a bit irritated and upset, I kept asking how are you in the deck when you’re inactive? He said it’s probably because he has gold (it’s like £16 a month, waste of money if you’re in a serious relationship, no?) and forgot to cancel. 

Again, he apparently cancelled the membership whilst on the phone to me and actually deleted his whole account this time. Then he said he needs to go as this made him upset. I didn’t argue, just brought it up. Also would he not be grateful I reminded him to cancel the membership (if it was really useless to him)?

Few days later, I was talking to the girl at work again. I said we had a chat and he deleted the whole account. She checked for me...his account is still there. And he shows up on the deck (how?? Assuming he’s deleted the app/account?)

I don’t want to bring this up anymore. I’m tired of being the bad person and bringing this up, I just want a relationship where we can trust each other. Every time he says “I love you” now, I have doubts.

In addition, he also went through my phone without my knowledge and denied it, calling me paranoid. Few weeks later, he admitted it when I asked again. It feels like there are so many lies already and we’re so early into it.

Apart from this, he can be an amazing person when he wants. Attentive, caring, forever complimenting me. There are some flaws, but everyone has them. I just don’t know how to weigh this out and would love some advice. 

Tl;dr: bf of 4 months has lied about deleting his tinder app twice now. He appears in the deck and two people I know already saw him. When I bring it up, he gets upset and/or angry with me. I haven’t brought up the second time yet, but I don’t know if I should as it already caused so much grief for him.
