0,"Mom got annoyed because I wanted to check her daughters ID


(On mobile, english not first language)
This story took place while I worked my shift at a local gas station here in germany.

If you want to purchase cigarettes in germany, you have to be at least 18 years old. Within the last weeks the company I work for got tested by ""test-customers"" (Testk√§ufer). They would purchase Alcohol and or cigarettes and just check if the cashier checks their ID. You could really get in trouble for not asking them for it.

With this in mind I ask everyone who looks a bit young for their ID.
In came a young lady (L). She told me the number of the pump to pay for gas and also ordered two packs of cigarettes.

Me: ""May I see your ID?""

L: ""Actually, it's in my car right now, shall I get it?""

Me: ""That would be nice of you, thank you."" 

Since she was so nice, I wondered for a moment if I should just sell her the cigarettes and tell her it's ok, but now that I asked, I had to stick with it.

A few moments later, this women (W) comes to the cash register.

Me: ""Hi, how may I help you?""

W: ""Number X (The number her daughter had not payed for yet, because I paused the transaction until she came back with her ID) and those two packs.""

Me: (realizing it has to be young Lady's mom) ""Ah, of course, that will be xx euros, please."" :)

W: (with a very cold, annoyed tone:) ""She pumped gas, so she OBVIOUSLY is 18!""

At this point, my eyebrows almost touched my hairline. Being confronted with this level of stupidity, my brain started to sort out which of the 100 reasons I could have for aksing her daughter, who looked really young, I should give her.

Me: ""You know, we get tested a lot at the moment. Also, I could loose my job for not asking for an ID when selling cigarettes.""

She then left without another word. Not even a goodbye.

I had a lot more to tell her, for example that pumping gas does not mean anything. There is no law that you have to be over 18 to pump gas. Also, in germany you can get a driver's license at the age of 17, if a parent is your co-driver. And hey, here stands this MOM. Telling me her daughter must be 18 for pumping gas.
I am still shaking my head days after this."
1,"No. Just because my car is parked in the back doesn't mean it's for sale.


Looking back, my time at a certain family-run appliance store was pretty laid-back.  I played on my laptop for half of the work hours like everybody else, about 5 purchases could supply the daily quota, and the delivery truck came only once a week. I only had one ""bad"" day, but it wasn't story-worthy. My manager basically got a closing competitor's inventory for a bargain, and we had two whole mac trucks of loosely-packed supplies. A few air conditioners were destroyed by toppling off a tower of about 7 units. It was put to the fault of the ones who stacked it, breaking laws/rules. I don't know the details, but they received punishments.

The job was so laid-back that a certain family project, an experimental car built by every guy related to me, got parked in the warehouse to have ""professional"" work time. Our tools were way better than the ones in the wooden shed. The ""experimental"" part of it was whatever way we felt like powering it that month. It ranged from small gas motors, to electric, to water attempts, to even rubberbands and industrial springs we found in a junk yard. Only the obvious worked so far. 

I didn't so much power the car as I was better at styling and interior. I put a small tv and radio in it, and styled the body like a rocket. I can't give a photo, but here's a sketch of my original intention that I made:

[https://sta.sh/01ii5y2cy2rl](https://sta.sh/01ii5y2cy2rl)

This thing was never, and will never be for sale. It's just a family tradition at this point. It's been a solid 17 years of grease and welding.

Sometimes people would see it through the windows of the storage room door and ask questions, but they never assumed that it was up for purchase given it's rough appearance. A few kids even sat in it and played with the controls that usually weren't plugged into anything.

However, this story wouldn't exist if this guy, DA, didn't come in one day. He even had a wife, who I'll call GW for ""good wife"".

I'll be OP, and there's two coworkers/family members C1 and C2.

DA: What the hell is that?

OP: It's a project car.

DA: How much is it?

OP: Oh, it's not for sale.

DA: But it's in the store. You have to sell it to me.

OP: That's not true.

DA: Don't argue with me! My son has been looking for a car for months, that thing will do fine!

OP: It doesn't even have an engine in it.

DA: Then how did it get here, huh?

C1: We got a trailer. It's parked outside.

His face was getting red.

DA: Sell me the car. 

OP: It's not for sale.

He basically said the exact same thing for about 5 minutes until he walked off to his wife, who was just looking for a decent stove. We went about stacking shelves until he suddenly disappeared. I had C@ look around while I checked the cameras in the back next to the car. As soon as I got to the window, I saw this guy in the drivers seat, rapidly turning the key and messing with wires trying to turn the car on. I called C1 and C2, C2 watched the store from the door as we walked over to DA with our arms crossed.

C1: You're kidding me, right?

DA: This car is terrible! You can't sell it like this! This is horrible service!

Is this guy serious?

OP: This car is not for sale, and the engine is currently suspended over your head.

DA looked up and saw a strange amalgamation of metals and plastics with stray splashes of paint and wires everywhere. I still don't know what it's intent was, but it was the engine.

He sputtered in anger, red like McQueen, as his wife stomped in and just glared at him.

GW: What are you doing? 

DA: They are refusing to sell this car for our son.

GW: WHAT? This is piece of crap!

Might sound rude, but I did nickname it ""Mr. Ugly"" so I don't care.

DA: I can fix it up!

GW: No! We are getting him the Honda, end of story!

DA: I am getting this car, and none of you can stop me!

C1: Sir, you are trespassing and possibly damaging our property. Leave now, or I will call the police.

He has two options: forget the non-functioning, experimental, rusty, three-wheeled joke of a car; or get arrested.

He got arrested.

Banned from the store and paying a fine. All the money we got out of it was put into the car, of course.

Thanks for the new bumper, pal. Couldn't have done it without you."
2,"""Explain to me why I'm in the wrong country!""


Just happened. I run a store that is in a city with the same name as a Canadian city. We are 4 hours apart and it can be confusing for some people. 

Let me be honest. I am not great with directions. I get easily frustrated when people call for directions because it is very easy to  use Google maps to get to where you're going. I also get nervous that I might tell them the wrong direction.

CI=Canadian Idiot
I get this lovely phone call:


Me: Hello!
CI: I need help finding out where to go
Me: Sure, Where are you at right now
CI: 2nd and Main st.
Me: That is really close! We are on 17th and Main St. So just keep going and you can't miss our sign
CI: But you're at 1707 right?
Me: Yes.
CI: Then why the hell am I by a building that is 1785.
Me: (Confused) I am not sure
CI: Explain to me whats going on
Me: I am not sure. But we are at 17th and Main, so just keep heading down the st.
CI: Not until you explain to me what's going on. Do you know this fucking city at all?
Me: Yes sir, I do.
CI: I'm by Science World (A place I have never heard of) so where am I?
Me: I am not sure, I have not heard of science world
CI: Oh fuck you, did you just move here?
Me: Sir, I cannot help if you are going to be frustrated and swear at me
CI: Learn the fucking city idiot 

*Hangs up*

I was super confused about this and googled Science World, HE WAS IN CANADA! A different country and had the nerve to yell at me. 

Good lord."
3,"Yes I have an ID but no you can't see it.


Okay so I work at a dollar store. We're required to ID EVERYONE for cigarettes and by everyone I mean my dad walks in there and I can't sell him cigarettes unless he shows me his ID. 
Enter OM(old man) he just had that look on his face that told me this wasn't going to be easy. He does some light shopping before coming to my register to be checked out. He just throws his stuff on the counter with a huff. 

Me: ""Hi! How are you?"" 

OM: *ignores my greeting* ""I need a pack of -throw in cigarette name here-."" 

Me: ""okay.."" I nod and turn to the cabinet and get his cigarettes. ""May I see you ID?"" 

OM: ""my birthday is.. Yada yada"" 

Me: ""I'm sorry but I can't sell cigarettes without seeing an ID"" 

OM: *now a bit torn up* ""I am NOT showing you my ID I am a (incert age here) year old man so I'm sure that I can Buy them"" *proceeds to pull his wallet out and hold it away from to counter, SHOWING me he had an ID but refused to let me see the damn thing.* 

Me: ""well, I'm sorry but I can't sell you cigarettes if you're not going to let me see your ID. I am required to ID anyone regardless of age."" 

OM: ""Is your fucking manger here?"" 

Me: ""No but she'll be back tomorrow morning you're welcome to come back if you feel the need to speak with her"" 

OM: *throws bag of items he was originally purchasing on the counter* ""I'll be back tomorrow morning then. And me and the store manager are going to have a long fucking talk about how disrespectful you and this company has been to a veteran.""

Me: ""okay, have a good day!""


He then left without purchasing anything. That's fine. He can come back tomorrow just so the store manager can tell him the exact same thing I told him. I'm sorry but I'm not losing my job just because your ass got insulted because I asked for your ID. "
