0,"Guy Calls Claiming We Stole $50 From Him, Finds Out Cash Back Is A Thing


So, I have to say that working Mother’s Day in retail sucks. People are coming in and out for cards, lining up to the point that two registers aren’t enough, and being overall grumpy. By the time Sunday comes around, I’m done. My managers are over everything and leave me up front to deal with the last minute shoppers.

It’s near the end of my shift and closing time for my store when there’s a phone call. I rush over and pick up after the third ring. Immediately, this man tells me how he was in that morning to buy two Mother’s Day cards only to look at his bank statement to find we charged him $50 for the transaction. At first, I’m thinking that’s way too much for cards (even the pricey $9.99 ones). Then, I realized he used his debt card meaning he had the option (as every single retail worker knows) of asking for cash back.

I asked him if he chose to have cash back. Immediately, his voice softens up as he admits he did. He laughs and thanks me for my time then hangs up. There was no drama. He didn’t yell at me. It just was a misunderstanding. I just posted this cause I thought it was funny."
1,"She really smelled bad.


When I was in college I worked part time at a ""do it yourself"" floor covering store. This store was owned by a really great guy and it was staffed by him, his two sons, two other guys, and myself.  We sold carpeting, tile, vinyl floor covering, etc. I was originally hired as a stock boy and that was my primary function but when it got busy it was all hands on deck for sales. They had a policy that if I though I wasn't going to close the sale I was to turn it over to to one of the sons or the ""old man"" ( he actually was only in his 40's).

One busy day a lady comes in and I went up to help her. I was immediately hit with some of the worst B.O. I have ever experienced in my life. I mean it made my eyes water and I was actually getting dizzy from her strong pungent smell.

I excused myself claiming I thought we might have some items she was interested in that hadn't been place on the floor yet and went into the back storeroom to find some help.

I found the owner's oldest son who laughed at me and said he'd handle it. A few minutes later he came back into the storage area gasping for air. He turned it over to his younger brother and he didn't last any longer. Finally the old man says he'd handle it and proceeded to work with this lady for over an hour and a half. He sells her a ton of stuff. She owned several properties she was fixing up.

After he finishes the sale and she left we asked him how the hell he could stand the stench. His reply was ""boys, all I smelled was her money"".

That man was one of the great mentors in my life."
2,"You are legally obligated to pay for the stuff that I damaged using products from your store


So for some background information, I am a manager at a craft store and this is an interaction I had with a customer 2 days ago that intensely frustrated me. 

Also sorry for any weird formatting, as I’m on Mobile.
 
C= Customer 
M= Me

C: excuse me miss could you show me where the brushes are?

M: of course *I then guide her to the brushes*

C: oh thank you!! (She said this in a weird overly nice way though which threw me off a bit)

C: Oh! Can you also show me where the spray paint is?

M: yeah of course it’s just right over there along the wall (gesturing towards wall as it appeared she was still looking at the aforementioned brushes and the spray paint was visible from the aisle we were standing in)

C: yeah I know but can you show them to me

M: um okay. (Walks the 5 feet over to the wall with her)

C: standing there staring at the spray paint, she then sighs very loudly

M: *quiet for a moment* uhm so do you need help finding anything else today?

C: you know I bought this spray paint from your store like last week

Me: oh yeah? How did you like it?

C: I used it to spray paint a 400$ vase of mine and it ruined it l, I’ll have you know. 

M: oh well I’m very sorry that happened. Do you know what went wrong?

C: the spray paint fucked it up! The spray paint I bought from your store!!! 

M: I’m very sorry to hear about your vase. This is why when I do my projects I usually test the product on a replaceable surface first, just to make sure that everything is working correctly and it’s the color I want.

C: 400$ just thrown away. What a waste

M: ....

C: *stares intensely at me* spray paint bought at your store. It was this one, right here *gestures to a specific brand of spray paint*

M: ahh.. I see... (Beginning to see where this is going to go)

*silence for a few moments* 

C: so are you going to give me a refund or what?

M: excuse me?

C: my refund? Are you going to give it to me?

M: uhm well do you have the spray paint with you or a receipt?

C: well can’t you just use this one off of the shelf? Like you already know what happened to it. You know it’s this one.

M: I need the physical product in the store in resell-able condition with a receipt to do a return. Also from what it sounds like, you’ve already used the product.

C: UGH fine. Just give me the refund for the vase then.

M: did you buy the vase from one of our stores?

C: no?

M: then I can’t return it if it wasn’t our item.

C: but your product ruined it and I had to throw it away!!! You are paying for the damage you caused to my property.

M: I’m sorry Ma’am but I am unable to do that. As we... 

* interrupting me mid sentence*

C: this is fucking ridiculous. Is this really what you people consider customer service???

M: I’m sorry if you are unsatisfied, if you’d like to make a complaint you can call our customer service line at ***_***_**** and my name is Orcellow. 

C: you’re a bitch do you know that? This is so unreasonable. You and your company are legally obligated to reimburse me my money. 

M: I’m sorry that you feel that way, however I am just following the rules set in place by our company guidelines. If you have an issue please feel free to call ***-***-****.

C: you corporate puppet. I’m never shopping here again. I’m taking my business to (competitor store) and telling all my friends to never shop here again. 

M: I’m sorry that you were unsatisfied with your visit with us today. As you know you may call our customer service team with any complaints. However in the mean time is there anything else I can help you find today?

C: No actually. She then proceeds to drop all her items on the floor and swipe a row of spray paint onto the ground. Then she marches to the front and leaves.

I then went to the back and screamed internally with my face against a wall. Sometimes I wish I could just respond and tell them they are a bitch and to get out of the store. Literally sometimes the only thing keeping me from exploding is trying to annoy them into leaving by becoming a customer service robot. Kill em with customer service ya know?"
