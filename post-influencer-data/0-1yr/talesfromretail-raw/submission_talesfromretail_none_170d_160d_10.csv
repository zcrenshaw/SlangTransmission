0,"Yes I speak Spanish too, pendeja.


So this is one of my all time favorite stories to tell about my work in retail so far.

So a little info on me, I'm very pale, i don't look very Hispanic. In fact my name isnt very hispanic either (so i've been told). So people usually think I'm white until I pull out my fluent Spanish.

One slow afternoon i get a lady and her 7 year old son come into my line. She speaks to me in English and i can hear her accent but i have a hard time deciding where her accent is from. Since she seems pretty fluent and has no problem understanding me i continue to speak with her in English. I notice that her son is browsing through one of the magazines we sell and i wait to see if she'll say anything to him.

We finish the transaction, I give her her bag, watch her start baghing her items and she has yet to mention the magazine. So i ask her ""ma'am, will you be buying the magazine?""

She looks at it and rippes it out of her kids hands, and I'm thinking 'ah crap she's gonna yell at the kid for grabbing something he shouldn't have' but instead she says, ""ay si, como si fuera a robarme este pinche revista de 3 dollares. Pendeja."" Which was Spanish for ""oh wow im totally gonna steal this stupid 3 dollar magazine. Dumbass.""

She tosses it to me and i say, in my sweetest voice, ""bueno, la revista cuesta $13.99..."" Which was spanish for ""well, the magazine costs $13.99...""

She looks at me and goes ""ooh no pues wow, hablas Espa√±ol. Babosa"" which was ""oh wow, you speak Spanish. Idiot."" And i say ""Parese que si. Que tenga un lindo dia."" Which was ""looks like i do. Have a nice day."" She told me to go fuck myself and left the store.

I used to hate that i didnt look like a 'typical mexican' but i've learned that I can use it to my benefit."
1,"How not to ask for a job.


This happened a bit early today, but hopefully worth the share. Smallish family owned hardware store.

M - Store Manager (younger Hispanic guy 25 or so)
O - Son of the Owner
R - Random walk in

R - How's it going? I'm looking to speak with the manager.

M - I'm the manager, what can I do for you?

R - Don't lie to me, I asked to speak to the manager.

M - I am the manager, is there something that I can help you with?

R - Yeah, you can get me the manager like I fucking asked you to.

M - I am the manager.

R - Fuck you! Just get me the fucking manager! I just want to apply for a job.

M - Gets O's attention and help.

O - Sir, is there a problem?

R - Yeah, I asked M to talk to the manager so I can fill out a job application, but he keeps lying to me.

O - How'd he lie to you sir?

R - He keeps telling me that he is the manager.

O - He is the manager.

R - So now you're going to lie to me too? Fuck man, I'm just looking for a fucking job.

O - We're not lying to you sir, but you will need to look elsewhere for a job.

R - What the fuck does that mean? I just want to fill out an application.

O - We're not interested in your application, you need to leave the store now.

5 minutes of arguing between O and R before R leaves, still not comprehending why he wasn't given a job application."

This happened a while ago but I'm writing about it now because i saw the lady that this story revolves around and once again thanked my lucky stars i got promoted to another position.

Back when i was a cashier, I worked really hard to remember all the codes for the produce and other items, especially our store brand water bottle packages (35 count). Our brand, plus another name brand, had short 5 digit codes we could input instead of having to scan the entire package. Unfortunately, every other brang we sold didnt have a code, so we had to scan them.

In comes Cranky Lady (CL) and soon to be Embarrassed Daughter (ED). The lady kinda throws her stuff on the conveyor belt and then zooms by with 2 packages of water bottles that i needed to scan, so i tell her ""ma'am may i scan your water first?"" She's quick to make a fuss about it and starts complaining about how she's ""not stealing, whats the big deal."" I ignore her, which pisses her off. She keeps up bitching and complaining, and i do my best to keep quiet. Eventually her daughter tells her ""mom stop it you're being annoying."" CL says ""oh am I? Sorry, I get cranky when i dont eat."" I quickly finish the transaction and move on.

One week later, I'm on the register again and its slow, so my mind drifts and i remember CL and ED and laugh to myself about the issue wh3n guesd who comes up to my register? If you said CL and ED, you get a gold star.

I kinda stare at her because i can't believe that she's right there when i was just thinking about her. And sure enough, she has 2 packages of water again, this time they're our store brand. I start scanning her items and again she zooms by with the water at the bottom of the cart. 

Me: oh, was that 2 or 3 packages of water?

CL: 2, do you need to scan them?

Me: no its alright i have a code here

CL: oh good youre smart, last week i had a dumbass scan them. She thought i was going to run with them. Pretty stupid of her.

I'm in shock. I can't believe her. I kinda stare at her and her daughter goes ""mom....dont start"" but her mom goes ""what? She was stupid.""

I smile. ""Was it the same brand?"" I ask her. ""Yep. I always get this brand."" She says.

I smile even more, ""really? Because i remember it being [other name brand] and that one doesn't have a code like [the sore brand] does.""

She looks at me and i can *see* her recognize me at last. She stays quite, and i see her daughter die a little inside. I finish quickly, and wish her a nice day, to which she responds ""yeah whatever"".

It honestly brings a smile to my face remembering this."
