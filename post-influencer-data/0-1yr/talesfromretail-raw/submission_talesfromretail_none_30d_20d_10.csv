So a couple of days ago a guy comes in looking really angry. John Wick type MAD. 

'Manager...Now', the look on his face already had me reaching for the phone. We've got a set word that brings the manager immediately, I used that.

Manager (M): How can I h.....?

Angry Guy (AG): Someone here sold my son cigarettes.

Now this is serious. In Australia, selling tobacco products to someone under 18, we're talking $50,000 dollar fine, plus potential closure of business type serious. 

M:When was th...?

AG:Yesterday afternoon, my son was smoking, I asked him where he got them, he said here. How could you sell MY SON cigarettes? He's not allowed to smoke.

M:If you can tell us the exact time he purchased them, we will check the security camera and see which staff member we need to report to the health department.

AG:I don't know exactly when he bought them, YOU need to find that out and fire whoever it was.

M:Come into the office, we'll go through the security footage and you can show us who your son is.

They disappear into the office, I am shitting myself. (When it comes to tobacco, I ask for I.D. if the person looks under 30. I have carded 40yo's.) Please don't be me.

10 minutes later AG comes storming out 'If anyone here sells cigs to my son again I will sue ALL your arses', knocks over a chocolate stand and storms out of the shop.

Me:Oh my god, what happened?

M:We found his son on the security footage. He bought cigarettes here from (Not Me), but he had his I.D. checked.

Me:What?

M:His son is 19. His dad just doesn't want him smoking.

Me:...WTF?

M:Pick that chocolate up.

Me:...FML."
1,"I know what you’re looking for. We still don’t sell it.


It’s occurred to me that some customers (usually older ones) seem to think that the item they are looking for will somehow materialize if they give us as much of a description as possible. A few examples:

An older couple stops me as I’m supervising the sales floor, and the wife asks me if we sell LED candles.

Me: No ma’am, unfortunately we don’t sell those, but I reckon [redacted] may have what you’re looking for!

Customer: LED candles, like for memorials.

Me: Yes, I figured we were thinking of the same thing, and as I said, we don’t sell them.

Her husband then holds his phone up to my face. The screen showed a picture of an LED candle.

Me: (internally screaming) I know what that is. We definitely don’t sell them.

A few minutes later, I saw the couple speaking to one of the salespeople, who had a look of HELP on his face.

There was another time a few weeks later while I was at the top of a ladder looking for something on a high shelf, when I heard the faint sound of a voice saying “Lightbulbs?” After I heard it two more times, I looked around to figure out where the voice was coming from since I didn’t hear any salesperson responding, and I saw an old lady standing next to my ladder looking up at me.

Me: Oh, I’m sorry ma’am, I didn’t realize you were speaking to me. (because you just said “lightbulbs” instead of “excuse me” or something that usually gets someone’s attention) How can I help you?

Old lady: Where are your lightbulbs?

Me: I’m sorry, we don’t sell lightbulbs. You could try the pharmacy across the street perhaps?

The old lady reaches into her purse and pulls out a lightbulb to show me. “Lightbulbs like this kind.”

Me: (internally screaming I KNOW WHAT A LIGHTBULB IS WE JUST DON’T SELL THEM AND CLEARLY THE LIGHTBULB IN YOUR HEAD IS A BIT DIM) ... We don’t sell lightbulbs of any kind.

It’s like some people think that even after we’ve said with certainty that we don’t have what they they need, their asking multiple times each time with greater detail than the last will somehow make us suddenly realize we have a secret stash of them somewhere."
2,"Customer was upset that we wouldn’t accept his two week post-dated check


A few days ago this guy comes through my line, with two full carts of groceries. The total came to over $700. He said he was going to write a check, and I said that was fine. We are allowed to accept checks for large amounts as long as we get a manager’s approval. So he finished writing the check and he hands it to me. 

The first thing I notice is he had post-dated the check for almost two weeks from now. 

**Me:** I’m sorry sir, we can’t accept post-dated checks. I’ll be happy to take it if you change the date to today.

**Him:** well what if I just post-date it for one week, instead of two?

**Me:** I’m sorry, we are only allowed to take checks that have the current date.

**Him:** is there a manager around?

**Me:** yes, I’ll call her over (calls for manager)

**Manager:** is there a problem?

 **Him:** yes, this cashier won’t accept my check.

**Manager (to me):** is there a problem with the check?

**Me:** yeah, he wrote it for two weeks from now and I told him we couldn’t accept it.

**Manager:** she is correct sir, store policy is we don’t accept post-dated checks at all. I see you have a large total, so I can stay here to approve it if you want to write a current check.

**Him:** I can’t do that. I don’t have the money in my account right now. That’s why I need to post-date this. I’ll most likely get paid next week, or the week after.

**Manager:** sir if you don’t have the money to pay for these items then you won’t be able to get them. 

**Him:** but I need this stuff! Can I write an IOU to the store?

**Manager:** no sir. If you don’t have the money, you don’t get the items. That’s it.

**Him:** Fine, then I guess I won’t be getting any of this! And he storms off.

This is probably one of the simplest concepts ever! You don’t have enough money, you don’t get it. Ridiculous to have to explain this to a grown ass adult."
