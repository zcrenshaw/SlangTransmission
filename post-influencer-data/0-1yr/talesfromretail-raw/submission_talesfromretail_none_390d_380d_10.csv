I work in a fine jewelry store 

My interaction with customers that just left 
Him “well we want to go get married now so we need a size 5.” 
Me “unfortunately all our rings will be stock size 7.”
Him “well... what about that one on your hand.”
Me *holds up Mens ring they had just looked at* “ this is a men’s so it’s a 10”
Him *points at my engagement ring* “no that.” Me”my engagement ring? It’s a size 5.”
Him “well we will just take that.”
Me”it’s not for sale. It’s my engagement ring.”
She gets annoyed and they speak Spanish 
Him “well this is insane and we’ll just go somewhere else in that case.”

I honestly can’t...
