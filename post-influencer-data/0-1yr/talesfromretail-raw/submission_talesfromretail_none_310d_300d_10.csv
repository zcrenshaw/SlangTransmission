0,"The Ink wall is invisible.


Short but sweet; I was working at an office supply store putting away ink.  


There was a wall the traveled about halfway down the store, visible from every corner of the building covered in ink cartridges.   


I was in front of this wall, with a flatbed of totes overflowing with various ink cartridges holding ink in my hand.   


I look over and lock eyes with a woman, who get's that ""Oh you work here, i have a question"" looking in her eye... I see her looking OVER a sign that says ""Come get your ink here""  


""No..."" i think to myself ""Surely she couldn't ask me THAT question..."" Something deep within my soul (Or what was left of it before i joined retail) told me she was going to ask me THAT... ""She sees me, so surely she has eyes.""  


She walks AROUND the ""Ink Here"" sign, stops in front of my flatbed overflowing with ink cartridges, while i have ink in my hands...  


""Where can i find the ink?""  


I pause... giving her a second for her brain to click... surely she would noticed SOMETHING to get her brain chugging along... no such luck... I slowly turn, motioning toward the 7 ft tall, 50 foot long wall advertising ""Buy two get one 1/2 off!"" ""Find your ink online!"" ""HP, Brother, Canon, Dell, Kodak INK"" and i say ""Right here ma'am!"" I almost lost my 'customer service voice"" saying that... i couldn't imagine someone not being able to realize this...  


Her eyes go wide, looking from left to right... as if she has to search for what it is i'm speaking about... before finally going ""Oh! Okay!"" and walks toward the wall...  


I felt i couldn't help her with whatever issues she had, so i continued my work with the ink.."

First time poster here so sorry if the formatting sucks. I work in a grocery store as a front end manager. This happened about a month and half or two months ago. (C= customer, M = me)

This lady comes in at 11:15ish for a refund. Our customer service desk closes at 10 and our store closes at midnight. The last cashier leaves at 11:30. So i have already pulled all the money from the tills and dropped it all in the safe. I have to use the last register open to do refunds. 

&gt; C: Yea i need to refund this Toilet Paper because my husband bought the wrong kind.

&gt; M: Sure no problem, I'll just have to get you down on Register 5.

&gt; C: Why can't you do it here at Customer Service?! That's what its for.

&gt; M: I'm sorry but it closed over an hour ago and there is no way for me to do it here.

So i take her down to Reg 5, all while she's complaining about not being able to get the refund at CS. The cashier had just finished up with an order so i told him to wait a second and let me get this ladies refund. There were several customers waiting (who had rather large orders) in line and a refund takes about 5 seconds for us to do. I didn't want her to have to wait in line for something that would take just a second. So I started giving her the refund. This is when it gets bad. She stops me and says...

&gt; C: No way, don't cut in front of all these people. It's f***** rude as hell man.

&gt; M: I'm sorry ma'am. It'll only take a second and you'll be on your way.

&gt; C: NO! F***** STOP. ITS RUDE!! 

She continues to curse and talk louder and louder repeating herself the whole time. I look over at the reg, hit a few buttons and hand her the money back. 

&gt; C: I still wanna speak to your manager.

I get the store manager and he talks to her. To make the story a little bit shorter she was basically threatening to punch me in my face and proceeded to call me a ""Stupid, fat, blonde mother******"". The manager told her to calm down and that he'd call the cops if she didn't. She came back through the line and i bagged her order for her. The entire time she kept threatening to punch me and insulting me. 

&gt; M: Have a good night ma'am.

&gt; C: I'm not going to since you ruined my night you dumb f****.

All of this simply because i didn't want her to have to wait to get a refund. :/ And to top it off she wasn't even wearing shoes. "
