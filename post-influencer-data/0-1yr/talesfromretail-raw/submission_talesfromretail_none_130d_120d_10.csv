0,"Finally went off on customer, and totally got away with it.


So I work part time at a convenience store while going to college on my GI bill. Really it's just to keep me busy while I'm not in school or gaming.

We recently had two people quit so my part time hours for the last couple weeks have been full time. Stretched between full time school, full time work and full time gaming, my days have been much more stressful than normal, and today I got a Karen in line. Behind her is a regular customer who I've waited on a million times.

I was ringing her up, and she had too many items for our bag carousel so I had to put some off to the side. When she turned it to begin picking up her bags some fell over onto the ground. I go to pick them up, but that's not enough for her. She demands that I give them to her for free, which I can't, because I dropped paper towel and napkins. I explain I can't, since nothing broke, and she goes  off on tangent about how I was rude, threw her stuff on the ground, and this is why I'm clerking in a store and don't have a real job.

I look around and see no one else around besides my regular, so I lean in real close and go ""hey lady, youre a bit of a bitch. Just so you know.""

She's flabbergasted, starts yelling and screaming for my manager, so i call him up. He listens and then asks me what happened. I tell him she began yelling so I told her she was being rude, and never called her a bitch.

My manager says he knows me personally and knows I would never do that. She points to the regular behind her and tells my manager that he heard it. 

The regular goes ""VoidJaunt didn't say anything like that, this lady is nuts."" 

So my manager tells her that since her transaction is over she has to leave. Shes red in the face at this point and storms outside, saying   she's gonna ""fix my ass"". I watch her go outside to make sure she isn't coming back with a gun or anything, but now she's screaming at her husband in her car.

He comes in after a minute or so and apologizes to me, and says he knows how she can get and I should just ignore her. He apologizes for the trouble again and they leave.

It's been the best day of my retail life."
1,"""you cannot return underwear if it is opened"" ""it hasn't been worn!!!"" ""It's open and it's stained though."" ""That's just wine!!!! SMELL IT.""


Had someone try to return underwear to my store today (we don't even sell underwear but I have to go through the ""we cannot return undergarments"" spiel first regardless.) This woman who doesn't look a day over forty comes in with a ratty looking plastic bag from another store and sets it on the return counter. I open the bag and almost recoil: it's a dirty pair of underwear.

I immediately close and tie the bag and say, apologetically, ""sorry, we don't turn undergarments. They are sold final sale.""

The woman argues firstly that they were only just opened and looked at and that ""they're absolutely unworn and not dirty."" I explain in the gentlest way possible there's definitely a brownish reddish stain on them and she gets frustrated and says ""IT'S WINE! I accidentally spilled wine on them when I was taking them out to look at them. Just return them please it's within the timeframe.""

I utterly refuse and explain that in addition to not even selling underwear at the store, we certainly won't take underwear with mystery stains back. She then says ""it's just wine! Smell it!!"" and starts opening the bag, presumably to allow me to smell her dirty underwear. I finally just interrupt her, rude I know, and tell her no and that she wasn't returning them to a store they weren't even from.

She asked to talk to a manager but I didn't see how it went since I didn't want to risk being around if sometime that underwear made it out of the bag.

Really nasty stuff."
2,"customer pretends her babies died in order to get a refund.


a long time ago when i was attending university i worked part time at a baby boutique that sold really fancy baby items. it's a small store owned by a local family.  the return policy was as such....refunds are credited onto a gift card or exchange only. i know that it was not the most accommodating return/exchange policy in the world. but i didn't make the rules. refunds were only issued by the owner at her own digression.      

now to the story...a lady comes in tears pouring down her face carrying 2 baptism/christening outfits that she ""purchased"" a few days ago. she tells me that she has to return these outfits because her babies (twins) that she bought them for had just died in the hospital and she needs a refund. my heart just about leaps into my throat and tears start coming down my face as i feel so horrible for this mother.  i ask her for the receipt and she says ""i don't have it, but you know that they are from here because you guys are the only ones that carry this brand in town""....so i'm like ""yes yes you are absolutely right"" feeling even more horrible and flustered for even asking...i then say ""okay no worries i can still put the amount on a gift card for you"" this was only followed by a wail of a sob and the lady says ""WHAT AM I GOING TO DO WITH A GIFT CARD!! I DON'T HAVE ANYMORE BABIES TO BUY FOR!!!"" oh my gawd i could have just crawled under a table...i was mortified putting this poor mother through this.  

the owner is on vacation (of course) and i was alone and must say that this was a first for me.  i was always trained that under no circumstance were we allowed to give ""cash refunds"" but i mean COME ON!!! this clearly was one of those ""special situations"" that surely warranted breaking the rules. i give the lady a full cash refund and she thanks me and is truly appreciative.  she asks me if i know of any other mothers that come in and if i can recommend support groups or bereavement books.  i told her that i do not personally know but i'm sure that there is lots of information on our local community board. she says thank you and hugs me and feeling like i did a good deed i hug her back and tell her to take care.  

when my boss returns from vacation i tell her everything that happened. i was confused that her reaction was a little unfazed.  she walked to the computer did a little inventory check and finds out that these items we're not actually purchased...like they were showing that they were still in our store....in other words....this lady stole them and got a cash refund.  my boss was able to confirm via security camera that this was true.  

there were no dead babies...just a sob story....and i felt like an idiot."
3,"In case you weren't sure, checks for big gift cards are bad news.


My wife came home for her break today with a fun story. She works as freight crew and cashier for a local grocery store. This happened today.

She heard the tail-end of a transaction where someone bought $500 in gift cards from her coworker. She comments to the other cashier, ""wow, did they actually have $500 cash?""

The cashier says, ""no, they paid with a check. Which is basically the same, right?""

Wife immediately pages a manager because her coworker is an absolute idiot. 

Why is the other cashier an idiot, one might ask?

1. We live in a high-substance-abuse area which means people are always seeking out ways to get stuff for free (in order to spend more money on drugs).  
2. Checks get cleared twice a week, meaning if it is not a legitimate check, they won't know, and by then the gift card could have already been sold, spent, etc, so the business is out that money. Only managers are allowed to accept checks from customers.  
3. Who buys a $500 gift card to a grocery store, in a region where $500 is the average monthly rent?

The other cashier has been working there longer than my wife. There's no way they didn't already know this was a problem. I've got popcorn and eagerly await the finale of this situation. Any predictions? I'd take bets but my state is pretty strict about gambling."
