0,"""It's your job to build me a new charger!""


So, I used to work at a big retail chain in the electronics department. I was not a cashier, I handled both stocking and some merchandising as we lacked a proper manager so they shoved those duties off on me. Corporate over there is a story for another day, today I wanna talk about a customer. 

Naturally, if the cashier was missing I would handle the desk when someone walked by. A taller guy walked up, decent beard and kinda dressed like a trucker. He set a bunch of different phone chargers onto the counter and just said ""I want this."" Of course, I just started ringing them up one by one but before I could even grab the second he stops me and says ""No, I just want this."" Mind you he's literally not point at anything, he's just saying it.

We just started this interaction and I'm already completely confused as to what's' going on so I ask for clarification, ""Which one do you want sir?"" He replies ""I want all of them but only one."" Yeah, that didn't clear anything up. I ask him what exactly he means and straight up tell him I don't understand what he's asking for. He says that he wants me to combine all the chargers into one single charger. I point out that we sell all in one packs that are meant for home, car, USB, etc but he says he doesn't want that one because its too expensive. He continues to explain that he wants me to open all 5 of these chargers and combine them into an all in one charger so he doesn't have to pay the increased price for the all in one pack.

At this point I'm just completely gone. I have literally no idea what this guy thinks we're supposed to be doing here so I tell him that not only can I not just ""build a new one"" but even if I could I'd still be charging him for all 5 which is way more than the all in one pack. The guy immediately goes straight from 0 to 100 and starts shouting at me about how useless I am because I can't build him a new charger, ""Whats the point of having an electronics department if you can edit things on the spot!"" and how he's gonna talk to my boss before he storms off. Honestly, the whole interaction was so bizarre that I thought it was a troll. You might be surprised how often people come in solely to fuck with retail because they know we can't get angry back.

**Quick little rant about the aftermath** \---Little note about big retail chains: The store owners generally don't care about what the employees say and take the customers word as gospel but my manager and I had a fairly close relationship so I knew I'd be fine. He didn't go speak to the manager, he filed a formal complaint with our corporate office about me. This would contribute to me losing the manager position I had  been working for and ultimately lead to me quitting. "
1,"I guess i gotta go now


Dont know why but i randomly remembered this store and thoughy I'd share.

So 2 to 3 years ago i was managing an art store in my city's CBD. Our store was shaped like an L. The door was opposite the counter, both at the front of the store and the rest of the shop would continue around the corner from the counter. The whole front wall of the shop from door to counter was made of glass giving a perfect view of the shopping centre and front row seats to a couple police/security chases. 

Out the front of the store were dump bins were we'd put all the cheap clearance stuff that we use to lure people into the store and that wont matter too much if stolen. 

So a lady comes in and she's looking at these wooden triangles on sale. They're like $3 and she starts collecting a heap of them. She brings them up to me at the counter and starts telling me how excited she is about them and how cheap they are and her plans for them. We chat for a bit, maybe 10 mins with me telling her my projects as well. She's so friendly and excited. As im talking to her i keep glancing out the window and i can see two cops standing talking to 2 women. This isnt too unusual and im thinking maybe these women were in trouble. Im scanning this ladies stuff but im constantly glancing out the window. By now im thinking that they're after someone cause they've been there for a while but im confused as to why they're still just standing there. Its not the first time we've had people slip in when we're too busy to notice and hide from police. Us only aware of it when police randomly escort someone from the shop.

Meanwhile the lady is still excitedly telling me all her craft projects and stuff and i start feeling guilty that I've been kinda ignoring her. I apologise, saying i am listening and that im sorry i keep looking out the window but there are police there and im a bit distracted. 

The lady is suddenly annoyed with me. Im kicking myself for admitting that i wasnt paying attention cause she probably didnt notice and now she thinks im rude. I ramble on trying to apologise and rebuild my rapport and credibility but i only make it worse and she's just short with me, buys her things and goes to leave. I follow so i can go ask the police if theres an issue. The lady remembers something else she needs and goes to find jewellery wire. I nervously ask the police if i can help with anything but they say 'no, they're ok' and then walk into the store. The two other ladies smile to me and we made some kinda banter. I go back to the counter and as i get there the two police have are holding either arm of the wooden triangle lady. She turns to me and says in the most casual and nonplus voice  'well, i guess im going now. Bye'. Then as they near the door she tells the cops not to forget her shopping. 

Not an amazing story in writing but experiencing it was so surreal. I totally didnt see that coming, she M. Night Shyamalan'd me, though in hindsight it was obvious why she became so annoyed with me. I couldnt stop laughing when she was gone cause i was so taken aback by her casual comment. "
