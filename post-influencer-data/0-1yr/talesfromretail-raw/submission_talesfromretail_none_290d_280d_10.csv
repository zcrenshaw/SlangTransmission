0,"Quickest I've ever seen someone show their true colors


So last night I had just gotten back from my break. I go to the register to take over for the manager who covered for my break. She's just finishing ringing an old lady up, and then this old lady goes on some insincere spiel about how people don't appreciate retail employees. How do I know this was insincere? Because I was looking at her to listen to what she was saying because she had directly mentioned that I see her often. She then said ""Don't look at me like that! I oughta smack you!"" She then stormed out with her groceries.

Funny thing is that I never even gave her a mean look or anything right that. She just went off on me for seemingly no reason, interrupting her own little spiel complaining about how people are jerks to retail employees. Oh, and she's a regular too. So I'll likely see her again soon."
1,"Incorrect price?


I work at a vitamin store, I’m sure you can guess which one. On this day I wasn’t working at my usual store, but at another maybe 20 minutes away since I don’t have an issue floating back and forth between stores for more hours. This man comes in and wants to buy a case of energy drinks. Our internet hadn’t been working at this store for three days so I let him know that I can only do cash or credit, he ignores me but I let him know one more time before I ring him up. I rung up the case and it came out to 25.99 plus 1.82 sales tax. 
Customer: Did you raise the price? It’s normally a case discount. 
Me: They may have slightly raised the price (which they haven’t) 
I explained to him the actual price of the item, and I explained that he was being charged tax as well. 
Customer: That’s not right, every time I come in I get a discount for buying a whole case, all I have to do is show my card. 
Me: Sir, I’m sorry but I’ve never heard of a case discount and we haven’t had the cards for about three years. Maybe it was a promotional thing, but we have a new promo now. 
Customer: No, that’s just the wrong price. 
He then puts his card in and completely ignores that I told him he had to run it as credit and enters his pin, it works for a second to ask if the price is correct and then he says no the price is incorrect. 
Me: Sir, you have to run the card as credit, I cannot process debit right now because my internet is down. 
Once again he does the exact same thing, ignores me again and tries to run it as debit and says it’s the incorrect price. 
I tell him one more time that I can’t do debit and he decides to pay with cash. 
As he was leaving he made sure to let me know to ask my manager about the deal since I don’t know what’s going on. 
Just because you think you’re supposed to get some made up deal and say the price isn’t correct, you’re not going to magically get a discount. All you’re doing is making the other customers in line wait while you have a temper tantrum. "
