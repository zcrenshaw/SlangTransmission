0,"Even without a receipt, we still know you’re lying


I used to work for an affordable, family-friendly clothing store that you’ve probably seen commercials for and bought flip-flops from.

I am going to call my customer L for Liar.

L [hands me a bunch of toddlers clothes]: I need to return these. They were a gift and I don’t have the receipt.

The clothes she hands me all don’t have any tags. They look worn and sun-damaged and old. I had been working for the company for 5 years at that point, and the style of the clothes were older than that.

Me: I can’t return these. They won’t be in our system at this point.

L [outraged]: But I just bought them a few weeks ago!

Okay, she’s changed her story, they’re no longer “gifts”.

I open the inside of one of the articles of clothing. Fortunately at the clothing store I worked at, each piece of clothing has a PLU code and the month and year it was released, such as 05/2014 or FALL 2017.

I show her all of the tags inside: 01/2001, 07/2001, 09/2001. They’re all from 2001.

Me: These clothes are from 2001. They’re not in our system anymore. At this point they’re more than 10 years old.

L [changing her story again]: This is so embarrassing! I can’t believe someone would gift me clothing items that are more than 10 years old!

She takes the clothes and leaves in a huff. Not sure what she expected, but we sure as hell aren’t taking those items back."

I work in a medical supply store. As you can imagine, I deal with a lot if things. This morning, I worked a few hours. 

Got a call right after opening. Gentlemen says that his wife will be coming in shortly to pick up some items for him and if we can give them to her. He can't call her because her phone is off. I told him I would do what I can. 

Fast forward two hours. The phone rings and I notice this guy is calling back. I answer. 

Me: (Name of company) This is me.
Dude: Are you the same person I spoke to earlier?
Me: Yes, that is me.
Dude: Ya, my wife just came home and she didn't have those items I wanted. 
Me: I didn't know she had been in here. (I really did and we weren't busy. The only female I helped was picking up an order for her husband with not this guys name.)
Dude: Well don't you guys have names on your receipts? You should have known. I told you about her coming in two hours ago. 
Me: I'm sorry.
Dude: Forget about. Too late now. *Hangs up*"
