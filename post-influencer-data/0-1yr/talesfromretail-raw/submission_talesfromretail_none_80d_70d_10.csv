0,"""Don't tell your dad"" - I watched a little boy win at life today.


I was the customer in line at the checkout, and the cashier was ringing me out when a family (mom, dad and a ~7 year old boy) pulled up behind me.

Dad immediately wandered away while mom started loading her groceries on the conveyer belt. After she loaded a few things, she turned to the boy and said ""you were really good today, would you like to pick out a chocolate?"" The boy got super happy, grabbed a kinder egg and put it on the conveyer belt. Mom then tells him ""don't tell your dad""

Dad comes back and mom says she forgot something so dad continues loading the belt while mom walks away. Dad then turns to his son and says ""you were really good today, would you like to pick out a chocolate?"" 

I have never in my life seen a kid look so happy. He picks another kinder egg and puts it on the belt. Sure enough, dad then says ""don't tell your mom""

I didn't say anything to ruin this kids wonderful 2 chocolate day, but I had a good chuckle walking out of there."
1,"Cashiers are not interested in your daily life


So I work at college campus in a store. This one regular comes in. She always talks my ear off and I try to be polite, but apparently she realized my disinterest. So she’s at the register. C is customer. Me is me

C: so there’s this guy, but I have a boyfriend- are you listening 

Me: i nod as I am scanning her items

C: I’m sorry for ruining your day. 

Me: sorry mam i just don’t do gossip while at work

C:it’s not gossip.

Me: would you like your receipt?

C: sure 

She leaves and comes back and finds me while I’m stocking

C: Do you have a problem with me? You’re always rude to me

Me: no mam im so sorry. I didn’t mean to come off that way, thank you for bringing it to my attention

C: well you’re being rude and you need to be nicer if you’re working here.

Me: im sorry mam

She leaves and comes back AGAIN and asks to speak to the manager so I get them, but the manager said to not worry about it but like . Believe it or not people customer service employees don’t give a damn about your life."
2,"Kid wants to scan his own toy


This happened a few weeks ago, and I just remembered about it, so the details might be a little fuzzy, but I’ll write this as best as I can. Despite the title, this is actually a happy story. 

So I work at a grocery store, that also sells body care and various gifts and toys around the holiday seasons (it was Easter, I believe). Our grocery store closes at 10 o’clock every day and around 9:30, there aren’t a lot of people in the store. 

This dad comes up with his son, around 6 or 7, and starts loading his groceries. He places the toy that is obviously for the son, behind another barrier that separates peoples groceries. 

After I had scanned all of the dad’s items and he had paid, the son, who was barely able to look over the edge of the counter, asked me very politely if he could scan his toy by himself. There was no customers behind them, and he asked so politely, that I was like fuck it, and invited him behind the counter. 

I told him to step up on the ledge where we put go-backs, so he could see better. I showed him how to scan the toy, and after his dad paid for the toy, he left a happy kid. 

TL:DR Kid wanted to scan his own toy, was polite, so I let him."
