0,"Refusing to pay sales tax


I work in a grocery store that recently got a hardware store put inside of it. Kind of a weird idea, but it's working well so far. They use the same register system as us though, and I frequently have to go help them with problems.

So, this old dude wanted to buy a circular saw blade for the advertised price of $9.99. On the register it showed $25.99 (the original price) and then it took off $11, and then took off an additional $5, bringing it down to $9.99. With sales tax it should have been $10.68

For some reason however, which I can't explain, the register was asking for $11.04. I couldn't figure out why it was doing this, but after doing the math and determining it should only be $10.68, I couponed 36 cents off the item, which brought the total down to $10.32, which was a little less than he owed. He decided however, that he didn't want it. He wanted it for $9.99.

After I went back to the front of the store be passed me on the way out and asked, ""Was that confusing?"" Like, I don't know if he was trying to be condescending but it didn't seem that way, so I just explained to him, ""Yeah, I don't know why the register was asking for $11.04. It should've been $10.68 with the sales tax, so I brought it down to 10.32 which is a little less, but...""

And then he was just like, ""Huh. Okay,"" and he left.

I don't know if he was a) trying to get over on us, b) not considering sales tax even though I mentioned it several times, c) assuming the tax was included in the $9.99, or d) refusing to pay the sales tax.

Some people just can't seem to comprehend anything you tell them."

Obligatory introduction about mobile, format, etc. 

Years ago, about a decade or so now, I worked at this big box store where uniforms were blue and khaki. Yeah, that one. 

I was working an Express lane, and we had just put the carousel bagging station on these lanes. They spin. And kids love to play on them, even though they're a pinching factory. 

This lady comes through my line, toddler in tow, talking on the phone. I start bagging her items and her child is trying to climb on the bagging station, while I'm trying to spin it. 

(No real dialogue, since it's been so long) I keep telling the child, as nicely as I can, to not play on this. I'm trying to spin it and I dont want her hurt. Now, if the mother was paying attention, she would have noticed that her child is in the way (literally right behind the counter, next to me) and hear me telling the child THREE times to not play on the carousel. Yet, she is on the phone, not paying attention. 

The final time the child has climbed up on the carousel, and I move to take the child down. I'll be Me, the woman will be IM for Irate Mom.

Me: Oh no sweetie! Please get down from there! You're going to get hurt! *moves to get child down from carousel*

IM: DONT YOU DARE TOUCH MY CHILD! YOU TELL ME IF YOU NEED SOMETHING! HOW DARE YOU! 

Me: *flabbergasted* I'm so sorry! I didnt want her to get hurt. I have a child myself!

IM: *picks up kid, bags, leaves*

The next customer sees how overwhelmed I was, and in shock, and tells me I did nothing wrong. They were watching and the mother should have been paying attention better, instead of being on the phone, and intervened long before I did. 

Upside? The next time I saw the Irate Mother come into the store, her kid was sitting in the seat section of the cart. "
