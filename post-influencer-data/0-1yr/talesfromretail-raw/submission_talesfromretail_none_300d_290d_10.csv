0,"""Sorry sir pictures are not allowed""


Hey, so I work for my family business, we manufacturer and sell leather products in a few stores. I was working a shift at one of the stores at a local mall last week when a ""customer"" came in, first he wanted me to price match one of our cheaper wallets for our premium leather wallets, which made no sense, but I tell him I cannot and think nothing of it. 

He stays in the store a bit longer looking at all the jackets and begins asking really specific questions about where they are made, how we make them and just a lot of questions. I think he's an enthusiastic customer so I happily give them lots of details hoping to get them to buy. 

He then starts asking detailed questions about our profits and financial situation, now this is where I feel it gets weird, and I vaguely answer those questions, but then I ask him why he is asking, I assumed he was just bored or something. 

He ignores my questions and walks around a bit more, looking at more jackets. I offer to let him try some on, but he claims its too expensive and walks out. 

He comes back about 30 minutes later, straight to the front desk and pulls out his phone, he shows me a picture of a leather jacket and asks me how much something like this would sell for. I tell him I cannot answer his questions, but hint that the jacket is not high quality so not for much. He gets offended at this and begins telling me about how he has amazing contacts somewhere who can make this jacket for him, and that he can easily sell it for so much money. 

I tell him thats great, but he insists on talking more and ends up telling me that he wants to get into the leather business and begin making and selling jackets as well. For some reason he thinks that he can disclose that information and continue to get information on our business, as he once again begins asking detailed questions about the business. 

I refuse to continue talking to him as he is wasting my tim. So I just tell him that I cant answer any more questions and ask him to leave. he leaves without much hesitation, but does call me rude. 


Today he came back with what I assume are his 2 adult sons. Now at first I don't recognize him (I can never remember customer faces), but I ask them if they had any questions about the jackets. He laughs and says ""no, but I do have questions for you"" I get really confused, but then I realize this was that business stealing man from last week. I cease to give them any further service and they leave after a bit. 

However, they come back again and start to take pictures of the jackets. I immediately go over and prohibit them from taking pictures. The son gets antsy and making up a story about how he wants to get a few of our jackets for his daughter and was taking pictures to show her. 

I tell him, sorry, but we dont allow photos. This is where he gets angry and starts demanding to know why we wont allow photos, calls me rude, tells me that they wont buy unless I allow the pictures and begins to tell me how its illegal to get him to stop taking pictures in my own store. I get fed up and tell him that the reason I'm not allowing pictures is because his wise old dad told me last week about how he wanted to make his own jackets and sell them, so why would I allow pictures of our own designs just for him to steal them.

He gets red in the face, yells a few choice swear words at me, tells me to get ready for competition and how they will tear our business down, takes his dad and leaves, all in front of other customers. I ignore them and continue my day a bit annoyed but unbothered. I deal with lots of intense customers, but these 2 were one of the worst ones. 

Sorry for any grammar and formatting issues, working on them now. "
