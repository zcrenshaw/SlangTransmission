0,"I once had to give a customer some really, REALLY bad news. Then the FBI showed up.


So yeah, years back I was working as wholesale manager for a large national auto chain. This chain also had a full service repair facility. When the service manager needed to leave, the technicians would come to me instead. This was one of those days that ended like no other....

I remember it was a hot day, well over 100\*F, a little after 2:00pm. I'm sitting at my desk looking for some part when one of the technicians comes up to me. His name is Kenny.

Now, Kenny is a real nice guy. He's in his early 50s, Vietnamese and has a great sense of humor. His English isn't great. He understands everything, but never quite got the hang of putting it to words, but he does fine given a minute. The man always has a smile on his face and he's an outstanding mechanic. I'd let him work on my car, and that's a real short list. Anyway...

Kenny: Mr. Silicon, you need come with me. Right. Now. \*he's stone faced, and he *always* calls me by my first name\*

I'm more than a little scared by how he looks. I'm thinking a vehicle has fallen off a lift, or someone is seriously injured. He leads the way to the service bay. He works in the bay all the way at the end, and that is where he takes me. On his lift he has a 200? white Ford Expedition. He guides me to the front passenger wheel well, the wheel and tire have been removed and are on the floor. Then he points up to the fender.

I stick my head up into the wheel well and look up towards the fender, and there it is. A large plastic and taped wrapped package, clearly containing a white brick. It's very large, like 8""x10""x3"". It's heavily taped to the inside of the fender.

I look at Kenny and he looks at me.

Kenny: Cocaine.

Sure as hell looks like it to me too. 

Me: What is here for? (the truck)

It's a lot of work, practically all the front bushings, ball joints, and outer tie rods. Vehicle is listed at \~78,000 miles.

Me: Do you know who this belongs to?

Kenny: No.

Me: Alright, just head back to the office, don't touch it.

I head to the service desk and pull the repair order. It's got a local phone number and address on it. I ask the service adviser who the customer is, he points to the waiting room next door. I peek inside.

Inside is an early 30's guy and his two kids, maybe 7 &amp; 5? Looks nice enough but you never know. At this point, I called the local police. I told them what we found, gave them the vehicle information and customers name. They said stall him for as long as I can, they will be there as fast as possible.

I head inside the waiting room. Introduce myself to the man, and tell him it looks like he might need a few more parts. I say the sway bar bushings and links could also use replacing. He looks at me for a second, then smiles.

Guy: Yeah, it's okay, if it needs it, just get it done. I've got time.

His kids are real nice too, they both introduced themselves to me, very polite.

Me: So how long have you had it? 

Guy: Only a few weeks! I just purchased it from auction down south.

Me: Really? What kind of auction?

Guy: Government seizures! DEA I think? I got an amazing deal. The thing is beat, but I can afford to replace the parts for the price and the body and inside is great.

Me: ....

Me: Man, I've got some *really* bad news for you.. \*I start to explain\*

Right about this time the local police arrive. They also have the local FBI with them. They examine the vehicle, and have Kenny put the wheel back on. Vehicle goes onto a flatbed and away it goes. Two of the FBI came with me to the waiting room where this poor guy is now freaking out. 

Turns out it was indeed a DEA seized vehicle. And they had MISSED THE HUGE BAG OF COCAINE IN IT.

They had to seize the vehicle from him, couldn't just take the drugs out and give it back, like gonzo, and no repayment. Unknown if he would ever get it back. Poor guy was devastated. Last I saw him the FBI was giving him and his kids a ride home in their SUV."
1,"Its 630am right now , and a guest lost her $6000 Luis Vuitton purse


Today, as I'm going into a work. Theres a lady outside asking a few of us to get a manager right away. Its 630am, stores not open, we're here to unload trucks, and she wants to speak to a manager because last night she lost her $6000 Louis Vuitton purse. The manager goes out and tries to reason with her to wait until open, but no, she said ""Your stores empty and there's plenty of employees to look for it""  manager tries more to get her to wait until 8am so they can resolve it. Nothing is in lost and found, and shes not having it

  I get it, a $6000 purse is a lot of money to lose, however, we're not all gonna look for it, and If someone found it last night, and I mean anyone, that things gone, it's a Louis purse, that purse alone is probably worth more than what's in it. I'm just gonna wait and see what happens later."
2,"Man loses $6k cash in my store


So many years ago, I'm having a pretty uneventful day at work when the phone rings.
It's a customer who was in the store an hour and a half-ish before. He asks if anyone found any money in the store. How much money are we talking about I ask. His answer, about $6,000. It's the proceeds from his car he sold just a few hours ago. Also says that if found he is happy to give a reward. I tell my coworker and we scour the place, but no luck.
The guy on the phone is disappointed, but is positive he must have dropped it here, asks if it's okay to come search. Be my guest I tell him. 
He shows up about 40 minutes later, spends an hour plus searching and researching the store. Nada. Finally he gives up. Says it just wasn't meant to be. Buys a soda for the road. Walks out the doors and throws receipt in garbage can outside doors. Then I hear him yell. 
I see him reach out to the garbage can and pick up a thick stack of money right off the top. He's literally dancing in joy. He accidentally threw it there with his last receipt. No idea how.
Don't know how many people walked right by that can over a 3 hour period. Also very common for people to go through the cans there looking for recyclables multiple times a day. 
Was some amazing luck. Just not mine."
