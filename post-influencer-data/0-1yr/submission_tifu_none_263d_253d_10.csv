"I did a big oopsie in German class


Ok this is going to sound stupid and most likely, fake, but hear me out, I promise you this actually happened. Also this story is very similar to that of the person is swore in their Spanish AP exam.

A short bit of context, I studied french for 3 years prior to this event.

So it was just before Christmas break and I was in my German class, doing excersises from a textbook with my partner. Soon enough, we strayed away from the boring exercises and started making jokes about everything in the book and whatnot. We were seriously having a blast, cracking jokes that we both found unbearably funny.

Next think I know is we started getting really loud despite the rest of the class being almost dead silent and then i made one final, supersaiyan, comedic gold, r/funny worthy joke in which I screamed “SCHEISSE” which, if you didn’t know more or less means shit in German.

The whole class turned their heads to me and went silent and in the moment of it I looked at my teacher who raised her eyebrows at me. Out of all suitable responses I could have said in that situation, I then replied with “Pardon”. 

At that moment, I knew, I fucked up. 

Not only did I scream “SHIT!” In German, but then I went and apologised in FREAKING FRENCH?! Of course this followed with a humiliating thirty seconds of laughter from all my class mates, however the teacher didn’t really care and resumed whatever teachers do behind their laptops.

In conclusion kids, think before you speak, or learn to speak fluently before you speak? Ok that doesn’t make sense but thank you for reading.

"TIFU by accidentally letting my brother see hentai on my phone and the bringing it up to him.


Actually happened yesterday 

My family has a tradition of playing games all day as a way of bonding. The way it works is we all put our phones in a bowl and then we play a bunch of games all day. Before we started I was looking at porn (hentai) and when we started I put my phone in a bowl and we started to play. After a few hours we got into an argument over the answer to a trivia question. So, we decided to look up the answer on the internet. My brother got up to look it up on his phone but, his battery was dead so he picked up my phone. I gave him my password because I had forgotten what I was looking at and I was caught up in the heat of the game. It wasn’t until he looked at my phone and made a weird face that I realized what was going on. I tried to keep a straight face and my brother started typing on my phone. He found the answer to the question showed everyone and the game ended. A few hours later I was feeling really weird because I needed to know if he saw anything. So, being an idiot I decided to talk to him about it. I went to his room and just came out and said “you didn’t see anything weird on my phone did you?” He started to laugh and said to me “I wasn’t even going to bring it up because everyone look at porn.”  He then jokingly said “I knew you liked anime but, I didn’t  think you liked it that much.” I immediately felt like a moron because I brought it up to him. I decided to leave but before I walked away he said “I do have one question about it”  “why do all the women have penises?” “Are you like gay or something?” I immediately respond with a “no” and he says “whatever” in a sarcastic voice.  Without really thinking I say “really I’m not gay I was looking at only women they have vaginas and everything.” My brother sat there for a moment and then burst into a huge fit of laughter. He then said “whatever man just know that denial isn’t good for you.” Then I just walked out the room. The next day he pretty much acted like nothing happened no jokes, comment, or looks. It wasn’t until after he left that he sent a text that said  I hope it’s roomy in that closet of yours which I actually thought was kinda funny. 

(Plot twist: I actually am a closeted bisexual but, he thinks I’m just gay which is funny I guess)

tl;dr: my brother saw hentai on my phone. I talked to him about it. He said he wasn’t even going to bring it up. Then he made fun of me and thinks I’m gay."

"TIFU by misjudging a closed ski slope and badly injuring my dad.


So in most parts of the world, including where I skied , in the Pyrenes, the snow this year has been an absolute shit show this year. Most resorts have fewer than a third of their slopes open and those slopes are pretty much pure ice caps.

So it doesn't surprise most people that after about a week skiing, I was used to the conditions and, because I was bored of the few open slopes, I started skiing down some of the closed ones, most of which were fine. Now as an overly ambitious dickhead, I decided it would be a great idea to show off to everyone that I was the best skier so one day, I decided to ski down a borderline off-piste slope, called an itinerary, in horrible icy conditions.

The details of the slope were as follows:
1)  60° steep.
2)  About 30 feet wide sorrounded by trees.
3)  Pretty much pure ice.

I was with my dad, uncle, aunt and cousin. At first we hesitated but eventually I found the balls to go into the slope. My family recommended against it but followed me in eventually.

Because of the ice, turns were pretty much impossible so we descended by scratching the ice. By the time I had realized my fuck up, I was already deep inside with no chance of getting out. We kept on descending and scratching through the ice, completing less than three turns in the entire slope. 

Then, when I was about halfway through, my dad, who was a bit further down, tripped on a branch from one of the trees. What followed was him falling and rolling down to the bottom of the slope narrowly missing various rocks and trees in the way.  Not being able to see the bottom of the slope from where I was, I panicked. By the time I made it to the bottom My dad was lying on the floor in pain. We later found out that he had fractured his leg and pulled several muscles in his left arm. He was lucky though as had he hit any of the rocks, it could've ended a lot worse. He is currently in hospital because of me but he is fine  at least. 

TL;DR : My arrogance influenced my judgement and led to me risking my life and the life of others on a ski slope that was in horrible condition and very dangerous, causing my dad to end up in hospital.

"TIFU by taking a bath


(Wrote this last night but forgot a tldr)

Ok so this happened all of twenty minutes ago and I am currently next to my girlfriend in bed wallowing in my shame. Apologies for the formatting, I’m both on mobile and drunk (double whammy).

So tonight is New Year’s Eve and for the first time I got to spend it with my girlfriend. It was  Heylovely, we made some baked goods, drank some beer, and generally had a smashing time. It is important to note that I generally don’t drink too often, and that tonight I went more than a bit above my usual. Later on we started to get frisky, ended up in the bedroom and eventually after we were done we both agreed a shower was in order.

Here is where the TIFU starts. As we were taking the shower I realized I probably wouldn’t be able to stand up for more than a few minutes and suggested we take a bath instead. After we had sat down I noticed a slight problem. I really, really, really needed to spin some yellow gold. Of course I wasn’t about to just piss in the bath and I certainly wasn’t going to get up and stumble to the toilet, so I decided to wait until we were out of the bath.

My girlfriend (bless her heart) started giving me a hand job. I had already cum twice so this was really appreciated. Anyway the point is, when i came, it was fucking amazing. I held eye contact with my girlfriend the whole time. This is the reason that I found out as quickly as I did, that it wasn’t cum at all. It hit my chest. My girlfriend was confused. The tidal force continued up my neck. I could see in her face that she began to realize what was happening. Finally in my drunken idiocy, I opened my mouth. And in poured that drink most shameful.

I don’t know how I’m going to live with myself. I want to die and my girlfriend won’t stop laughing. Help.

TL;DR drank from my own fire hose  "
"TIFU by running away


happened yesterday. im not expecting any sympathy because i know im in the wrong here. just need somewhere to vent off. it still feels so surreal and i wish this was just a nightmare that i can wake up from

a couple months ago, my grandma gave me her television saying that it's already mine. i stash it away in my room and used it once for a D&amp;D session but that's it. it has been sitting there all this time and now that christmas came, i thought of giving it to my girlfriend, since after all i havent used it and they dont have a television. so i gave it to her last Dec 23.

fast forward to Dec 29. now my grandma comes to my room and asks for the tv back. im confused on why. she tells me that she only gave it to me to keep my hoarder uncle from taking it, which she didnt even mention at all. she tells me she didnt give it to me but instead made me store it for her. she begins twisting her words and crying. at this point im stuck because my girlfriend's family already set up the television and i dont want to take it from them since they spent a lot of money already to set it up. it would also be a pretty shitty thing to do.

fu no. 1: i didnt tell my girlfriend immediately. i thought that i shouldnt tell her and keep it from her. my plan was to buy a new tv and either give it to my grandma or give it to my girlfriend and return my grandma's tv. i thought that she shouldnt have the burden of this problem since this was my fu.

dec 30. now my parents know and they insist on taking it, with or without me. i tell my girlfriend and we try to make a plan. fu no. 2: i had doubts my girlfriend would break up with me because of it. the afternoon comes and i couldnt convince my parents otherwise.

fu no 3: out of anger, i fled from my house without telling my girlfriend, rode a bus, and went somewhere far away. i dont have a phone currently so it was hard. while i was riding the bus, i kept thinking on the things that ive did wrong and come to the conclusion that what i am currently doing is really wrong. i was thinking that i am running away to think and reflect but i really was just running away from the problem.

fast forward, now my girlfriend hates me and wants to break up with me. she tells me that what i did was selfish, and that i only thought of myself, not her. she is ashamed of my family. from the context ive taken, my parents went there but i dont know what happened. i wasnt there to support her when she needed me the most, even when i know i dont have a solution yet. i really fucked up now. maybe im just sensitive about it after all it's just a breakup but i really dont want to break up with her. i love her so much. my heart hurts but i know hers do too, if not more than mine. ive fallen in love with her since we were in high school and she just noticed me during our college years. its my first relationship, yes, but i still do love her to bits and i cant see myself without her.

just needing somewhere to vent off, i guess.

tl;dr: grandma gives me tv, gives gf the tv, grandma wants it back, cant think of a solution so i run away. now break up happens"
"TIFU by falling asleep while brushing my teeth and losing my sense of taste


I came home today very late from a party at around 5 am in the morning. I cannot fully remember what happened after I entered my home, but what I know is, that I undressed and started brushing my teeth. Somehow I thought it was a good idea to lie down in my bed while brushing and shortly after that I must have fallen asleep.

&amp;#x200B;

I have to add, that the toothpaste I used was a bit pungent. Well, after an extremely uncomfortable night I woke up not able to fully remember the last moments of the night. I just had this weird taste in my mouth and a slight pain and there was a mixture of some white substance around in and around my mouth.

I went to the sink to spit out the white substance in my mouth and wanted to brush it off my tongue before noticing that the toothbrush was missing. I searched for it and found it stuck between my bed and the wall, which was very confusing. After brushing off the toothpaste I looked into the mirror and saw that my whole tongue was sore and all my taste buds were glowing red.

&amp;#x200B;

I tried to drink some water, but it felt weird. I only felt the viscosity of the water and that was the point I fully realized what happened: The toothpaste corroded my tongue and now most of my sense of taste (mostly in the front part of my tongue) was gone.

&amp;#x200B;

Now I don't really know what to do. Food doesn't really taste like anything. I tried some chocolate and it only felt like some strange mass. even my own mouth doesn't taste like anything anymore. I guess I just have to wait for my senses to come back...

&amp;#x200B;

**TL;DR** \- I fell asleep with toothpaste in my mouth and it corroded my tong, removing my ability to properly taste."
"TIFU by making a joke in marching band, then being referred to as a weeb for the rest of the season


So for a little background, the trombone section in my marching band does a thing called ""Low Rider"" at football games,  where all of the low brass lines up, gets a trombone and swings it (coordinated) above each others heads while the tuba plays the bassline for the song Low Rider (Sorry for bad formatting, I'm on my phone now).

So I play the trombone in the band too, so the section invited me to play it with them this year. So we had an event that that the low brass was invited to attend. We decided to do something new for that event, but couldnt decide. Oh well, it wasn't for 2-3 months or so. So about a week goes by, and I remember that our Low Rider group has a group chat. So being the edgy freshman that I am, I was looking at memes and I scroll by ""Rockefeller Street"" meme (if you dont know it, look it up on Youtube). So instantly, I get what I thought was an amazing idea. 

Now here is where the Fuck up happens. So I quickly open up the group chat and spread the word of joy to them, and to my suprise it was instantly turned down by literally EVERY SINGLE PERSON in the section. EVERY PERSON! Huh, I thought it would be halarious and we could swing our 'bones like the 2 guys did in the vid. And after me trying to defend my idea, and the section shaming me for it, I officially gave up on it and now the whole section calls me a weeb for it. I don't even like anime or that shit. Oh well...

TL;DR: I recommended ""Rockefeller Street"" as a special thing we do in the Marching Band Low Brass Section, and now the whole section calls me a weeb."

"TIFU by asking a customer if he needed a hand with anything


This happened a few years ago, back when Future Shop still existed in Canada. Before we had Best Buy, we had Future Shop! Tragically, it was sold to Best Buy and some years later went out of business.  

At this time I’d been working there for 2-3 years in the the “Entertainment” department. We dealt with video games, music, and movies, and a great deal of merchandising. It was late, close to closing, and I was making the rounds, asking the few customers who happened to be looking or waking through if they needed help finding anything.  

Anyone who has worked at this kind of place for an extended amount of time knows you kinda get set in your ways when it comes to how you approach a customer and sort of go on autopilot when the day is dragging. At my store, we were trained not to ask “can I help you?” because that apparently caused people to immediately shut you down. So, you find new ways of asking that same question a hundred times a day.  

Eventually I settled on “do you need a hand with anything?” And this is where I fucked up.  

I went around the corner and headed over to the Best Sellers section of the music department to approach a customer who’d been browsing for a little bit. He’s got his back toward me since he’s looking at the CDs. Honestly, this memory is so burned into my mind that I can remember basically every detail about this man — the colour of his jacket, the way he’s got his hair parted down the middle, his blue eyes wide in shock as he gives me that deer in the headlights look…  

Without hesitation, I ask “Do you need a hand with anything?” Instead of answering, he turns around, arms bent at the elbows and immediately I'm so embarrassed I could disappear. Instead of two hands I see that he has none. Whether he lost them in an accident, or he was born without, he was missing both of his hands. Like, literally zero hands. Neither of us say anything and we just look at each other in horror before I walked away.  

TL;DR Asked a customer with no hands if he needed a hand."

"TIFU by wanting to be a gentleman


The title might be a bit misleading, but it's basically what happened.

So, after shopping today me and my gf wanted to grab a cup of coffee and wen to the nearest café. Now, pretty much all the tables were full, except for one, but it had only 1 chair. I was like ""look, I can lift one of those empty chairs from other tables and move it to that table, no problem"". She asked the waiter if that's OK, and he confirmed. 

Now, the chairs looked really light and I'm doing a bit of weight lifting, so I was pretty confident that won't be a problem. How wrong I was.

My gf wanted to drag the chair to the table, but, oh no no no! I wanted to carry it. So I grab the chair and that fucker was heavier than I ever imagined. Mind you, the café was freaking full, a lot of people there, so I didn't want to look like a pussy. I went all in: I crouched to get a better grip. The thing is, the chair was also really wide, so I couldn't get any kind of grip at all. I lift it up somehow, but my balance was totally fucked. Now, I'm there, in the middle of the packed café with that freakin' chair in my hands, barely holding on. I take one step and I realize, this shit is too heavy, I have no control and no balance. I half-assed a few more steps and when I was close to the table we wanted to sit at, I lost the balance completely, the chair fell down (surprisingly in the correct position), and I kind of fell into the chair (the seat part), face first, my legs up in the air and since this was a kind of a rotating chair, I spun for like 180°. 

It was so fucking embarrassing. When I got up and looked around EVERYONE WAS LAUGHING, including my gf. I felt so stupid and silly... and then I had to sit there and sure enough the fucking table was in the middle of the café, there was nowhere to hide. Well, at least the coffee was good.

TL;DR: wanted to lift the chair and bring it to the only empty table in the café; the chair was too heavy, I lost balance and fell with the chair."

"TIFU by not spelling my name correctly when booking a plane ticket


This is really more of a Today My Mom Fucked Up, or TMMFU.

My mom's middle and first names are smushed together on her passport, and typically when booking boarding passes she makes sure to write her name as such. This time, however, she booked a flight through a 3rd party and forgot to make this distinction so at 3:00 am when attempting to check in this morning, the lady at the counter told her she could not print a boarding pass if her ticket does not match the name in her passport.

We called the airline and the 3rd party booking site, and actually managed to change the name on one of the boarding passes but not for the first flight before the layover, meaning she still could not board. Ultimately, my dad and I decided to go on the flight anyway and she would try and book another ticket. 

She just called and said she's not planning on joining us, since it would cost too much to book this late. I'm so sad because now she's going to spend new years alone, and she was looking forward to this trip the most out of any of us.

TL;DR: My mom misspelled her name when booking a flight and now won't be able to join my dad and I on a family trip"
