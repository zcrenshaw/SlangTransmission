"My seemingly normal dad disowned me when I wouldn't lie in court for my sister AMA


Thought I'd finally post this. Came from a Baptist family in the south for background. My sister has been addicted to drugs most of her life. 

She has two kids and cheated on my brother in law. One of the kids is from her ongoing affair. 

My brother in law is an amazing person and agreed to stay with her instead she files for divorce and makes up an entirely fictional account of him beating her among other things. She would take the kids to buy crack with her etc.. During this time she was supposed to also be the caregiver for my mom who had Alziemers and passed away two years later 

The divorce got really ugly and lasted 16 months as they fought for custody of the kids. It finally reached a point where my wife and I would have to provide testimony to the situation. We did the obvious right thing. We told the truth. Our testimony was critical in my brother in law winning full custody. I had to do what was best for the kids. My dad even tried to bribe us before. When he disowned me that meant he doesn't get to see my daughter his granddaughter.

 It's been 7 years and we are still estranged and my sisters kids ended up in another state with my brother in law so my dad essentially lost all 3 of his grandkids because he bankrolled and supported my sister in the case.

After court he said ""I never want to see yall again"" that would be my young daughter, wife, and me."

"I am an American that moved to Australia looking for a better life AMA.


When Bush Jr won his second term and after we had a school shooting in Las Vegas, we moved to Australia. That was 15 years ago. Since then my kids have grown up in Australia. We have received excellent medical care. Our health has improved. Our lifestyle has improved and we would never move back to America."
"At 17 years old I was forced to marry a man almost 15 years my senior by my Muslim parents AMA


I’m turning 20 in a few days so this happened a few years ago. (Throwaway account and a few slight details have been changed and I’m being ambiguous to protect my anonymity)

I live in a western country and my parents migrated 16 years ago. Our family dynamic is very strange even as muslims. My mother is the more prominent parent in my life whilst my dad is very reserved and doesn’t interfere with my life, he’s been in the process of learning the Quran by heart and has devoted his life to Islam.

When I was just about to turn 17 I was sexually assaulted, I confided to a friend about the situation months after this had happened and they told my mother about a very private and traumatic event I had experienced. 

Immediately after finding out she physically and verbally ‘punished’ me. She gave me an ultimatum and said that either I get married since I was a shameful whore or she’d expose me to the rest of my family and community. I obliged and was pulled out of school and she’d organised for me to get engaged (at this point I was close to turning 18) and two weeks after my 18th birthday I was to marry a stranger."
"I'm Larry Sanger (Wikipedia co-founder, Everipedia CIO) and I am calling for a general #SocialMediaStrike tomorrow and Friday. AMA!


I propose not a new platform but an entirely new architecture for the entire social media world. Just as the blogosphere is decentralized, social media posting should be decentralized. Just as you own your own blog, you should own your own social media data.  


This is not a new idea. It's the idea behind r/mastodon_social, /r/minds, /r/gab soon(?), and /r/diaspora and many more (give me a list and I'll link to it). We need to bring all of these together with one common standard (maybe a successor of ActivityPub? But that's not for me to decide), and into the mainstream with more funding and attention. ~~#~~DecentralizeSocialMedia!  


[**Please strike**](https://larrysanger.org/2019/06/declaration-of-digital-independence/) **tomorrow and/or the next day (July 4-5).** That is, don't use big social media except to repeatedly announce/agitate that you're on strike. Please sign this [Declaration of Digital Independence](https://larrysanger.org/2019/06/declaration-of-digital-independence/). Please get all your influential friends involved ASAP so we can get millions of people announcing, repeatedly, that they're on strike tomorrow. [The media](https://twitter.com/lsanger/status/1146140428338716674), both left and right (I've been interviewed by both the Guardian and Fox News) are pretty solidly behind us.  


So come on, everyone, let's make this even bigger. Make a (nonpartisan, respectful) noise on Facebook, Twitter, etc., please, and other networks...on many, I already have [no account](https://larrysanger.org/2019/02/my-facebook-deletionday-goodbye-message/)!"

Hey guys! 

I currently work full time at a sex store and have been in the industry for almost two years. I've worked in several different stores - even one with an adult arcade, and all in questionable areas. There's definitely never a dull moment. 

Ask me anything!"
