"My (22M) girlfriend keeps playing very weirdly in orchestra and I am not sure what to do ?


Hey all - throwaway for obvious reasons.

I play in an orchestra with my girlfriend who is wonderful is every way. We have been together for 5 years, we share a lot of interests, have a great social life etc. Well, every way except one.

At the beginning of each rehearsal/performance we do what’s called ‘tuning up’ where everyone in the orchestra starts by playing the same note (an ‘A’ - it’s common to all instruments and also the note of an orchestral triangle.)

So there’s like 70 of us all playing the ‘A’ note at the same time. (The idea is then everyone tunes their instrument by reference to the shared ‘A’ note.)

My girlfriend is a violinist and she is very good. But she has recently started tuning up in a way which is annoying other people.

Instead of just playing the ‘A’, she starts playing really loud, quite complicated pieces (I said she’s good, right). And it drives people crazy. Everyone (literally the whole orchestra) is trying to tune up and she’s playing a solo or something really really loudly at the same time.

No one has said anything but the looks have started in earnest. Last week rehearsal she played the first minute or so of Salut d’Amour which is not a discrete piece at all.

I’m not sure how to bring it up with her because I do want to support her playing, but it’s started to annoy people and I’m getting looks too. People can’t tune up and I think she’s being arrogant?

Would be grateful for any advice. Thanks a lot.

**TL;DR my girlfriend is playing weirdly at orchestra, when no one else is, how do I sort it out?**"
"I (27f) have gotten messages from a girl (23f) claiming my husband (26m) of 8 years, was in a relationship with her and also on dating apps. She has proof.


I'm extremely scatter brained right now, and sad and confused.

Basically, we've been married 8 years and we have an 8 year old daughter. Technically, she is why we got married, but we were in love and we still are.. So marriage made sense.

We are both often busy, he works from 7am until 3pm, and I work until 6pm. He gets off work, gets out daughter, and usually when I get home, he goes to the gym.

She sent me a DM explaining everything. She said she tried to DM me a few weeks back but she thinks he has my Instagram on his phone, and was rejecting the messages before I could see them. She said she felt bad, but didn't feel right about giving up on letting me know.

My husband does some fighting as a hobby, and he had a fight come up this last Saturday.. and that's when she messaged me. She said she did it during his fight so he couldn't see the messages first.

So, she gave me her number and asked me to please contact her asap.

I did.  In the messages she explained she met him on plenty of fish. She said they were together for 7 months, and he just randomly started acting weird and ghosting her. She also said though, that around that time.. She had found out he was still active on POF for almost 2 years even while with her.

She told me she has all the proof I could need, if I wanted, and I asked her to meet up with me instead of doing it over text.. So we met up yesterday.

Seeing her made my heart hurt even more, but I couldn't find it in me to be angry. She's one of the sweetest girls I've ever met, and I really admired her for going through the trouble to let me know

She handed me her phone and told me to look through her gallery, where she had a folder of thousands of screenshots of conversations they had. I saw him confessing his love, making plans with her, talking crap about me, his ""gross ex wife"", and telling her I cheated and that's why we got divorced

She let me look through her texts, where I saw that days after my birthday, he texted her early on a Saturday and said he wanted to pick her up and have sex before he worked construction with his dad.

She had photos of them together in his car. She had photos of him, and videos of him calling her by name and telling her he loved her. He even sent a long video talking about all the ways she's better than me.

He even sent her pictures of him with our daughter and saying ""your babies miss you"", and even just videos and pictures of our daughter. 

She kept warning me about some of this stuff, but I wanted to see it all. I ended up crying, and she kept apologizing about it, but said it would kill her if she just let me keep going on thinking things are perfect.

I didn't even see him this morning. I'm disgusted. And I'm hurt. And I'm absolutely crushed.

She told me they have been broken up since late July, and that's when she tried to get a hold of me and couldn't. She said she decided to try even harder, because he came back a week and a half ago, and was acting like everything was fine.

This is half just me venting I guess. I have nobody to talk to about it. But also, what are my next moves?

I honestly don't want to give up on us, we've been together so long and I'm wondering if maybe I could be doing better? Maybe I'm boring now? What do I do? I love him to death and I don't want to lose him at all but I can't even look at him the same. We haven't even talked yet. I took today off work, and in just waiting for 3 when he walks in the door and pretends like nothings going on. 

Tl;dr; girl messaged me about my husband cheating. We met up, and she had very very solid proof. I'm hurt and don't know what to do next. Make it work? Move on? What?"
"My best friend (20M) asked me (20M) out. I said yes. I didn't know it was a date.


I'm an idiot. I'll try to keep this short. Also, I was a bit drunk when this happened.

Noah and I have been best friends since 2nd grade. We live together with one other friend near the college we go to together. He came out to me when we were in high school. It didn't change anything. When we got to college, I came out as bisexual.

Last night we were hanging out with some friends and I had a bit to drink. When we were walking home I could tell he was nervous so I asked what was up. He asked if I wanted to go out with him. He literally said ""do you want to go out with me"". I don't know why, but I thought he meant as friends. Thinking back he made it really obvious it was a date, but I'm an idiot and I was still a bit drunk. I said yes. He suggested Saturday night. I said yes.

I left to go to the gym before he got up so I didn't see him. While I was at the gym, the friend we live with texted me that Noah was really happy this morning and she didn't know we were going to go on a date. She congratulated me and said we make a cute couple. This happened literally six minutes ago. I'm panicking right now. I don't know what to do. I love him but he's like my brother. I can't go out with him. How can I tell him I'm not interested without embarrassing him more than I have to? I don't want to mess up our relationship. We're supposed to have lunch together in a few hours. What do I do?

tldr: I'm an idiot. My best friend asked me out. I said yes. I didn't know it was a date. How do I fix this as easily as possible for him?"
"[UPDATE]: Should I (33F) tell my ex’s (28M) girlfriend that he pathetically contacted me?


Link to original post: [https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/95u8md/should\_i\_33f\_tell\_my\_exs\_28m\_girlfriend\_that\_he/](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/95u8md/should_i_33f_tell_my_exs_28m_girlfriend_that_he/)

Original post TL;DR - Dumped ex for cheating. His other unsuspecting girl reached out to me to tell me the details and saved me from further heartache. They’re now together and he has contacted me in an attempt to get me back. I’m not interested, but should I tell her?

&amp;#x200B;

Update: Sorry for the delayed update for anyone that was interested, but I moved and life has been hectic. I read every comment on the original post and considered every option. A couple weeks after my ex initially contacted me via email, he sent me a text message asking if I would ever talk to him again. Like before, I didn't respond. A couple days after I moved, I messaged his gf/the previous ""other woman"" on Facebook since that was my only form of contact with her. I first asked if they were together, to which she responded ""yes"" a couple days later. In a brief conversation I told her that I felt I owed her the courtesy since she once extended the same to me. I told her he had contacted me twice in the last month and gave her the gist of his email. She said she figured that's why I was contacting her, said she really appreciated me telling her, thanked me, and said she hoped I was doing well. I told her good luck and went on my merry way. No catfighting, no unnecessary chatting. 

In the end, I feel bad for her. Yeah, she made the horrible decision to get back with him but I'm sure she did hoping/thinking he had changed. He never will. Men like that don't. I was his unwitting fool for nearly 5 years, now she has that burden. I haven't heard from him since or heard anything from his family who still occasionally keep in touch as to whether she dumped him or not...my gut instinct is she didn't. Either way, my conscience is clear, a ""favor"" has been returned, and I'm still happily no longer with a cheater. Cheers folks!

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR - Contacted the gf, told her everything, she said thanks, we went our separate ways. No Jerry Springer."
"My (24M) boyfriend of three years came home from holiday and told me (22F) he’d kissed someone. And is now asking for an open relationship.


He came home, we went to lunch and he told me what a good guy he’d been because his buddies were being shitty (they have girlfriends) and how I would’ve been proud of him. 

Then after lunch he took me to a river and asked me how I felt about our relationship - I told him I loved him (bc true). He told me I was the love of his life and he didn’t want to be with anyone else. But that we’re young and he doesn’t want to regret anything. He then told me what happened - he went out dancing with another lady and they ended up kissing before he left. I’ve trusted him through or relationship so I’m banking that to be all that happened. 
I just told him that we’re human and things happen. 

He then asked for an open relationship- bc he didn’t want to feel guilty for kissing someone and maybe probably doing it more in the future. I was taken back and at first I almost saw it being something possibly? But then I went home and thought it through and realized it wasn’t for me. 

I told him this and that I didn’t think I could be with him knowing that he wants to sleep with other women. And he kept telling me that we didn’t need to break up and that the open relationship was just something he wanted to see how I felt about. 

I don’t feel like he ever said sorry and if he’s not sorry okay cool. But am I crazy to feel like he didn’t consider me in the equation at all? I am feeling a little of everything. I know I can’t be with someone no matter how much I love them knowing that’s how they feel. 

I feel blind sided. Open to all thoughts. I can’t tell if I’m not truly seeing his side. Please tell me if I’m being fair. 

TL;DR - BF went on vacay, smooched another gal. Came home told me what happened then asked for open relationship. Am I crazy for not thinking it’s something to work past knowing he wants to be with other women? "
"Update: my (26M) father (84M) is abusive and has been since I was 2. My siblings (43F &amp; 39M) want me to forgive him.


Original post: https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/9adkmc/my_26m_father_84m_is_an_abusive_piece_of_shit_my/?utm_source=reddit-android


So I listened to what yall said. I never deserved what he did to me and my siblings are normalizing his abuse. 
I moved 3 days ago. I'm not in my new home in another state. On my way out of my previous city I stopped at his house. I told him ""You are abusive and cruel. I never deserved what you did to me. I am never contacting you again. I wish you well and hope you try to improve as a person."" 
I feel so damn good. He tried telling me since I was 2 that I wasn't enough and never would he enough. But I bought a farm and survived the military and have close and wonderful relationships with people. I beat him. 

I told my siblings and they reacted badly but then I grew a spine. ""He was good to you guys but he almost killed me. Or did you forget that?"" And surprisingly they acknowledged it. Said it was easy to put in the past because it didn't happen to them. My sister had a child 5 days ago. My brother has 3 kids. I asked if they would ever hurt them and they said of course not. Well why is it okay that dad hurt me and you expect me to forgive him? 

Haven't talked to my mom about it yet. She's gonna react badly. But that's okay. I deserved and deserve better. 

To anyone in abusive households: get out. Cut ties. You deserve better. 

Thank you for supporting me. 

TLDR: Cut out abusive shit father and told siblings they needed to accept that. Moved into new farm. Moving forward in my life without him dragging me down. "
"My (28f) husband (28m) of 2 years promised me he put the new registration sticker on my license plate. He didn't. I got a massive ticket, his reaction is sort of ""oh well, stuff happens!""


So some background, I did all the work to reregister our cars for the year. I was out of town when the new stickers came so I saw on our USPS delivery digest that the stickers had come. So I asked my husband to put the new stickers on the license plates. He texted me back maybe an hour later say ""all taken care of.""


So I was in Asia for about a month for work and got back on my very first drive out I thought nothing of the new stickers because I had a text confirmation that it was done. To my complete surprise I was pulled over for having out of date registration. The cop was a total dick because he was unwilling to verify that the registration was actually current. But not only that, when he came up to the window I had both my personal and work cell phones on the center console which he took to mean I was using them. So he gave me two tickets for each phone as well as two distracted driver tickets. I am going to contest these in court because I was not using them. However if I were to just pay the tickets it would be almost $1300 and that isn't to mention the slam our insurance is going to take, probably either way. 


I was very upset at my husband. I asked him why he didn't put the stickers on, he said he just forgot. I asked him why he told me he put the stickers on the plate, he said he ""pre-texted"" and meant to get to it. I asked him who was going to handle the time, energy and frustration of actually going to court and his response was ""well stuff just happens sometimes.""


I am livid with him and this level of irresponsibility and at least for the foreseeable future, it's going to affect my level of attraction to him. 


What can I do about this situation specifically and what can I do about this long term?

**tl;dr:** my husband didn't put our new registration stickers on our license plate and as a result I got five traffic violations and now have to try and fight them in court. His response is basically ""stuff happens.""

"I'm [18F] a bit creeped out by a guy in my dorm[18M] and not sure how to handle him. UPDATE


https://old.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/9eguts/im_18f_a_bit_creeped_out_by_a_guy_in_my_dorm18m/?st=jm1ahzov&amp;sh=5ef815b5

There were a lot of people who offered me advice and encouragement to deal with my problem and I want to thank those people first. Since there was interest I thought I'd provide an update to the situation now a few things have happened. 

So as I spoke about in the comments in my last post I'd sent an email to the RA in my dorm explaining the issue and asking to speak with her. She got back to me quite quickly and asked if I could come see her and also asked to speak to Trish the other Asian girl he'd made some comments to and hassled along with a couple of witnesses, the guy who heard me yell at Chris when he entered my room without permission and one of the people who witnessed photos of me on his phone. 

She took some of their statements down and chatted with us all then with me alone for a bit. I spoke about things he's done like follow me and ask me questions about who I'm talking to and I bought some poems he slid under my door as evidence. We talked about what's been happening,how I'm feeling and about boys and college in general. She shared some of her own bad experiences with persistent guys and showed concern over things that have happened between me and Chris and felt like it needs to be stopped now before things can possibly escalate further. She especially was concerned at some quite racist things he's said and that he has pictures of me taken without permission. She said that it shouldn't ever be tolerated on campus and that she'll speak to her superior about our issues. I also talked about wanting to tell him how I don't want his attention and that he makes me uncomfortable and asked for mediation and she said she'll arrange it. She's a nice person to talk to, I'd not spoken with this RA much but seen her around. 

The RD spoke with her and he decided he would bring us both in to his office to try and resolve some issues. I was nervous but the RA I spoke to before would also be there and I felt reassured at least that she's on my side. They asked me to speak first so I told him that I'm not interested in his advances and that his actions have made me feel intimidated and uncomfortable in my own home and around campus.  He seemed all a bit naive and immature about the situation and acted like he couldn't understand what he was doing was wrong but he did acknowledge that entering other people's private rooms without permission was wrong and apologized. 

When the subject of racism came up he said he didn't think what he said was racist. The RD explained that he can't say things like that and it's against school policy to discriminate against other races or make them uncomfortable with those kind of comments and Chris finally apologized for those comments too. When he spoke he agreed to not pursue me anymore and to stop posting notes. He was asked to remove photos from my phone and did it there in the room. He took several photos of me around the dorm and was told it was warned about respecting privacy and about student safety. He again seemed to miss the point and not really understand what he did wrong. Chris mostly just kept asking if his parents would be informed of any of this if he agreed to leave me alone. He seemed kinda angry but he couldn't really do anything with the RD in the room watching and all he could do was constantly ask that. 

Anyway we concluded that he accepts I'm not interested in a relationship with him, he asked about being friends and I said I prefer we avoid each other as best we can and he eventually agreed to that too. He again apologized for making me uncomfortable and for making remarks that he shouldn't have made along with other stuff he did like pictures and being nosy. We pretty much agreed that we'll stay away from each other and that meeting ended. I didn't feel great but at least I said what I wanted to say. They also addressed what I told them about him saying he wants to do a class I'm in. They asked if he's applied to switch to that class yet and he said he hasn't. They said if he does they'll have a chat with them and make sure we are put in different classes. After the RA spoke to me again alone. 

She gave me some leaflets she had and told me about a course I can take on campus to help girls with self confidence and dealing with bad situations at parties and stuff like that, and how to look after myself. Said if I'm worried about anything to call her on her number and we can talk. I felt a little better after that but still nervous about dealing with Chris who now felt wronged and probably like I told on him. 

It turned out that after speaking with the RD alone he requested to move dorms. I was thinking of putting in a request but was told he'd already done so. I was not told of the reasons he gave but I'm assuming he decided he didn't want to risk getting into more trouble. I was told that the RD and him made some agreements and it's on record that he was warned about his behavior and he's agreed to various things to improve and to have regular counselling to improve his behavior.

 He's agreed to not approach me or do anything that can be seen as harassment or intimidation. Things like watching me, spreading rumors or trying to contact me directly or through others and stuff like that. 

 He can't enter our floor of the dorm building after moving unless he's accompanied by an RA or campus security. (latter is just in case he leaves and says some of his belongings are in the dorm. He can come in with an RA and collect them and will have to leave right after. They'll be there to make sure he doesn't use it as an excuse to cause trouble. 

He's not banned from the dorm building itself or visiting other people but if he's seen loitering around outside without any reason to be there they might consider it harassment or intimidation. 
  
He also agreed to not ever do anything like follow any students around, post notes,enter private rooms or make racist comments and so on. 

If he breaks any of these agreements he'll probably have some sort of discipline action taken and is being given a chance to behave himself. The RA said they'd prefer to not just punish students but work with them and hopefully he can have more positive relationships with other students. 

I'm not 100% happy with him just being warned but at least he's agreed to leave the dorm and the new building he's in is about 15 minutes walk so no real reason why he'd need to come here since it's out the way. Spent one last night in the same dorm and we both stayed in our rooms and avoided speaking. The found a space for him pretty quick and helped him move the next day and that was it. He didn't come back to collect anything else and I've not seen him since he carried his stuff out the dorm yesterday.  I hope he listens to the warning and sticks to what he said he'd stick to. I want to enjoy myself on campus again without worrying about what he might do. I didn't see him as dangerous but you never really know. I hope this will be the end of the issue and I can move on from this very stupid person. 
  ---   
  tl;dr: Met with RA and RD at my dorm, gave evidence against the guy and they mediated a meeting between us so I could explain how his actions affected me and explain I'm not interested in him. He eventually apologized even if he didn't seem very genuine and also deleted photos of me. Later he requested to switch dorms and made an agreement with the RD to refrain from racist comments,leave me alone,not enter my dorm and not do anything to harass me or any other girls. Hoping that this will be the end of the situation as now he's been officially warned that any other actions will lead to more serious consequences. "
"My cousin [16M] got a new car for his birthday. My parents are buying us a car and my brother [16M] opened his fat mouth and complained it was pre-owned. We may not get a car at all now.


I'm still in high school. I've been driving for a little while learning from my parents. It's been hard because mom and dad both need their cars to get to work. Mom is teacher and dad is a lawyer. We only really have Saturday and Sunday to get experience with them. 

School for my brother and I is a while away. We need to get a short bus ride away. It's about a 10 min bus ride. My brother and I have been asking for a car. With the idea that we'd drive ourselves to school and our sister to middle school. 

Our cousin got a new car for his birthday. It cost his parents around $30,000. Our parents have been looking at previously owned cars. Dad and Mom said that we're crazy if we think they're spending that much money on us. 

My brother then decided it would be a good idea to open his fat mouth and yell at mom. He told her that dad earns more money and he should choose. You probably know how this went. He got grounded by my parents. My dad was really angry my brother had the stupidity to question how much mom makes, 

Dad does earn more than, Mom, but she keeps this family  running. She had to go to ER last year and we were a mess. 

My parents said we're probably not going to get a car at all. I didn't do anything. 

How do I fix the mess my brother made because I want a car. 

**TL;DR: Brother may have cost us a car.**"
"Should I [16F] tell my family about my cousins [15F] behaviour?


My cousin Holly and me don't see each other often as our parents live far away, and while we're the same age we aren't that close. Nothing against her but we are very different people. I'd say that I don't like her but I don't dislike her either. 

She's the family favourite. Very pretty, a straight A student and her teachers have made her Head Girl. She's said she wants to do something like medicine or engineering when she finishes school. Her and me get along well enough and are connected on most social media. 

However, a lot of what she posts on instagram and snapchat bothers me. Her stories always have her and her friends in school uniform, smoking joints in what looks like a field (usually with a caption ''High AF'' or something like that.) I've smoked weed before and while I didn't like it, I don't think doing it makes you a bad person, but there are some other things from her stories that make me sick. 

A few times she's posted pictures of other girls from her school, captioned with something like ''Imagine having to look like this ugh''. I felt really sorry for whoever those girls were. 

This week a lot of schools started up after the summer holidays. Holly and me are both starting Year 11. On the first day back (yesterday) she posted a story with a boy sitting on a bench at school, only for another boy to come from the back and punch him in the head. Not a slap (which wouldn't have been OK either) but a full on punch, enough to knock him to the ground. Holly was laughing throughout this. She didn't film what happened after so I have no idea if that guy was ok. 

I've not been bullied but when it happens at my school I do try to stick up for the people who get picked on. My parents always taught me that kindness was important. I'm feeling like telling someone in the family about what Holly has been doing, because people are getting hurt. However, I'm not someone who plays the hero and sticks my nose in things that aren't my business. It's not my problem at the end of the day, but I don't want to see anyone else be hurt.

  **tl;dr**: My cousin has been humiliating and hurting people at school, and I'm not sure whether I should tell her parents or mine. "
"[UPDATE] Me [26 F] with my BF [29 M] of 4 months, I don't know if I like him or if I'm settling


Original: [https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/8oeecq/me\_26\_f\_with\_my\_bf\_29\_m\_of\_4\_months\_i\_dont\_know/](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/8oeecq/me_26_f_with_my_bf_29_m_of_4_months_i_dont_know/)

Hi everyone! I posted 3 months ago about a relationship I wasn't fulfilled/happy with. The tl;dr is basically, I got into a relationship I didn't think I wanted, but wanted to take it slow, felt like I should break up with him several times throughout the relationship despite not having a ""reason,"" and in general going back and forth on caring for this guy but also feeling like it wasn't quite ""right"" and not seeing a future with him.

I had all of 3 people respond, but you guys sang true (as usual). That I shouldn't be with him. But since it's so hard to get a boyfriend where I am, and because I had such little self-worth (which was only worsening by being with someone I wasn't happy with because I felt I couldn't do better, perpetuating the low confidence even further), I decided to give it one last try.

I had originally posted in June. In July, I wrote out a script to break up with him, but the idea of it made me so sad after thinking about it for days and days that I finally gave up and said it'll be fine, I'll just keep going.

Narrator: It was not fine, and she could not keep going.

This guy was perfectly acceptable. Sweet, listened to me, cared for me. But there was no passion, there was no x-factor. There was no sexual chemistry. He was kind and nice and made himself available for him but being with him, I would realize later, was exhausting. I didn't want to make time for him, I felt like I didn't have enough time for myself. I felt selfish to keep in my life as emotional support and little else. The sex was bad, passionless, and we only had sex like 9 times in the half year we were dating. No bueno.

Finally, at the end of August (two weeks or so ago), I called him up and broke it off. I told him he's wonderful (he is. He IS, that's what made this so hard), but I needed time to work on myself, I needed to be alone, and I just didn't see a future with us. Like everything in our relationship, he was receptive to it, said he was sad but he understood, he came by for a quick chat about it and he got his goodbye kiss and that was it. 

I was sadder than I thought I would be. It wasn't like I didn't care for the guy. He treated me better than any man I've ever dated. But you just can't change the way you feel about people.

What really got me was how many hours and days and weeks I spent AGONIZING over whether or not I should break up with him. Even though I knew it wasn't right (somehow, my gut, my heart), I couldn't pull the trigger and wanted to keep trying, hoping the feelings would appear at some point. They didn't. And the fact that I wasn't sure about our relationship in the first place, and the fact that every month the same thoughts would recur and make me wonder if I should be in the relationship at all, was proof that I shouldn't be in it.

So I'm writing to you all, so if this resonates with anyone, know that you are not alone. I know how hard it is. You want so desperately to make the relationship work. Sometimes it's nobody's fault. It just wasn't meant to be. The feelings aren't there. 

I was scared to be alone again. Scared to be sad and lonely. But you guys, I am doing better than I have in MONTHS. Since I started dating him, really. I am going to the gym 3-4 times a week, I climbed a mountain this past weekend (and I can finally walk normally again lol), I'm spending time with friends and devoting free-time to trying new recipes, doing kind things for my friends, meditating (shout out to the Calm app), and reading more. I am SO much happier. I didn't realize this would happen. Even though those first few days were really hard, and I even thought I should call him up and call off the break-up and be like ""this is fine, let's just keep going,"" and even though I cried a few nights about being alone, I got over it. I am okay. I will be okay. I can work on myself, be with the people I love and become the person I've always wanted to be. I am so happy to be where I am, alone, working on ME. So I can be ready when the right guy DOES come around.

Thanks for reading, and love to you all.

tl;dr, the first few days after the break-up made me sad and lonely as I expected, but I am doing better than ever, working on my physical and mental health, and am excited to get up every day rather than dreading being with someone I wasn't in love with.

Our girls are all daddy’s girls. They always phone me first and always want to call me when I’m traveling or if they are. I’m always trying to respond to their needs, and I’m the one who always took them to appointments and stayed home with them when they were sick. 

My wife gets jealous of lots of stuff. Our eldest daughter wasn’t feeling good on her birthday and I asked her if she wanted to go driving, and she asked for it to be just her and me. This made my wife angry when I mentioned it. 

Other times she will get resentful of them and me if they come running to be comforted or if they want to cuddle. 

She also can be unreasonable with the kids, expecting them to understand processes or doing things her way. For example if they use the wrong kind of towel for cleaning up a spill. Worse is that if I try to temper her she will turn on me and ask me to support her in how to raise our kids. I try to tell her that if you want things done your way you need to take them through the process step by step. 

Our girls are smart and practical. They are fairly independent and have been doing stuff like cooking and baking since they were four-five, so they know how to follow instructions and they often memorize stuff. For example our 8yo mixed pancake batter and made us pancakes for breakfast. 

And finally, if I try to raise this issue she gets defensive and angry and her go to argument is I’m their mother and I know best. 

TL;DR kids are very close to me and trust me, and that makes my wife jealous.  "
"[Update] My parents (60+) overstepping boundaries with my wife and I (28/32) [original post title: Wife trying to “open my eyes” about my parents behavior]


Last week I [posted](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/9bfgqv/wife_trying_to_open_my_eyes_about_my_parents/) about my dad calling my wife's best friend to talk about my wife and I. A few short updates:

 - After my original post, my dad sent a message to my wife's best friend, basically saying that she had spun the story in the opposite direction to make him look like the bad guy. He told her that he thought the call would remain confidential between them, since he asked her not to tell my wife and I about it. If it was supposed to be private, maybe that call shouldn't have been made at all...

 - My wife and I received an email from my mom, stating that my parents are shocked and saddened that we confronted them about contacting my wife's friend to ask about us. There was no apology, no acknowledgement of overstepping, or anything to accept that they broke a boundary. She said *we need to treat each other with respect* and this should be solved by having a face to face meeting between my parents, me, and my wife. (we originally emailed them to avoid an in-person meeting which would lead to over-emotional and overreacting responses) Finally, my mom said that our daughter would not be proud of my wife and I, and how we are choosing to address my parents. *(note: our daughter passed away after birth last year; my mom saying this only made this situation worse)*

 - My brother has called me too, and has made it clear that he's surprised that my wife and I are reacting this way. He was asking me several questions and I eventually realized that it seems he has taken my parents' side in this scenario.

 - Latest: my dad has texted my wife and I to say that he will eventually be emailing us his side of the story, and why he originally called my wife's best friend.

Thank you for the countless responses last week and all of the supportive and helpful comments. I'm no longer questioning that my parents have intruded too far, and am now looking back realizing a history of seeing this behavior from them. The next step is trying to accept that it's not on me to try and fix this. My wife said she doesn't see a relationship ever healing between her and my parents; I personally don't want to cut them out of my life completely, but after this it's probably going to be much different. It's difficult not knowing what the next days/weeks will be like - currently it sounds like they are going to remain ignorant to their own actions.

**tl;dr** - Several updates to original post, my parents are still not apologizing or accepting that they overstepped a large boundary."
"UPDATE: My [23M] socially awkward roommate [25?M] is starting to creep me out


Thanks to everyone who gave me advice on the original post. Much appreciated! Here's the link:

&amp;#x200B;

Ok so I just spoke with the leasing manager, I'm now transferring rooms within the same apartment complex. In fact I'm moving all my stuff on Thursday! Unfortunately I have to pay a transfer fee that is half a month's rent, but as far as I'm concerned it's worth it.

&amp;#x200B;

One thing I am a bit worried about is how he's going to react when he finds out I'm moving. I have no school on Thursdays so I plan on moving everything while he's in class, ideally I won't have to deal with him. However there is a good chance he will come to the apartment at some point while I'm moving all my stuff (he's pretty much always there). Honestly I have no idea what I'm going to tell him. Should I just straight up say it to his face that I'm moving out because he's a creepy ass weirdo ?

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR: Randomly assigned roommate is a creep and a half, so I'm switching to a new room. Not sure how he's going to react when he finds out that I'm moving."
"I (F38) am socially awkward, started a new job with colleagues who are close and starting to treat me as a friend, I haven't had any friends in a long time, have no idea what to do


I am really hoping someone can help me with this.
I'm very socially awkward, from childhood, but made worse from an abusive (emotionally/mentally controlling and intimidating) relationship. The only friend I had was my ex's friend which fell apart after I got away from him.

My last job had lots of client contact which was fine as I have a ""professional persona"" that I put on, and I had an office to myself that was out of the flow of traffic, my colleagues often forgot I was there. I tend to self isolate anyway so didn't often join for lunch or other breaks.

I recently started a new job which I absolutely love, but it's an open plan and the current staff (all female) are very close.

They are so lovely and inclusive of me and have friended me on fb and I have even exchanged numbers and texts, all initiated by them, even picking me up something on their morning coffee run before I get there.

They obviously care about each other, and are showing the same interest in me, but I've got zero social skills. I find myself spending the conversation planning what I should say to show the appropriate amount of interest without being nosey, or what I can say to sound interesting so that they will want to keep talking or monitoring my facial expressions, and as a result sometimes miss what they actually say. It all sounds very weird, I know.

I've spent years being made to feel like my needs are less than unimportant, so to have them consider me (staying back to wait for me when I'm running late etc) I feel anxious, like I'm putting them out.

I've been in therapy for the last 12 months and come a long way, but due to my new job I am not able to go very often.

I have always wanted friends, especially women friends, but I've never had the courage to pursue anything due to not knowing what to say and feelings of worthlessness.  

I tried bumble bff and all the women I've matched with and started conversations with have just stopped responding (8), so I feel like I don't have much to offer or I'm very interesting.

Is there anything I can do to improve socially? These women are so lovely, and I feel so excited they are so welcoming and wanting to be friends, I'm just scared I'll do or say something weird and freak them out, I just want to be a good friend.

Sorry this got kinda long. I hope I don't sound too weird, twelve months ago I wouldn't have been able to get this far, my fear and awkwardness made me come across as cold and uninterested. So this is pretty huge for me. 

Tl:Dr I'm socially awkward and having trouble navigating new friendships"
"My [22F] friend [21M] was recently removed from a leadership position in an organization due to misconduct. I'm next in line for succession, but he wants the position back.


I don't want to be too specific at the risk of people figuring out my identity because this is a rather large organization at my university and many of the people in it are Redditors.

Essentially, my friend was president of this university organization until last week. I was the vice president. Unfortunately, he broke a shitload of rules (both school rules and rules of the organization) that led to his removal. He is also at the risk of suspension/expulsion, but I will get into that later. Following the removal, I got a phone call saying that I will be the new president for the upcoming term because I am next in line as far as succession goes.

I'm not going to lie - the news excited me because anyone would be grateful to be in this position. I was over the moon and never expected this to happen. I'm sad for my friend, but he had many chances to fix his behavior and did not, which ultimately led to his removal. I've had a clean slate since starting at the organization whereas my friend gets himself into some kind of shenanigans every other week.  

Today he sent me a text saying that there's a possibility that he can get his position back. He asked if I would be willing to step down once he goes through his hearing. I don't doubt that he would be able to get it back because he has very wealthy parents and they are hiring a lawyer to make sure that he doesn't face any disciplinary action as far as suspension/expulsion goes. However, that means that there is also a possibility that he will be able to reclaim is seat.

He's stated in the past that if the general consensus from others is that he should step down, then he *would* step down. At this moment in time, that is very much the consensus, but clearly he didn't mean it because now he is trying to become president again.

My question is this: Am I right to be salty about this? I don't know how I am supposed to react moving forward without risking our friendship or seeming power hungry. There's also a possibility that maybe I am wrong and being selfish, so please let me know if that is the case.

**TL;DR:** I will be replacing my friend as president of a university organization because he broke many school rules, but he wants the position back and is asking me to step down. How can I refuse this without angering him? "
"Boyfriends startup is failing and he blames me


My boyfriend (50M) and I (40F) have been dating for two years and we recently moved in together (it was his idea to move into a  place that I own). We both are entrepreneurs and live fairly comfortable lives. He had a successful exit from his first start up but is struggling with his current one.  My startup is a constant struggle but I keep sufficient money coming in the door with other contract work.  

Up until now, we our relationship has been great; we communicate well and respect each other and are supportive.  One month ago, he decided (with my blessing) to rent an apartment in another nearby city 6 hours away where he used to live and had more friends, and we have agreed to split our time together between the two cities.

Last weekend we had a horrible fight that was completely out of the ordinary for us.  Then last night, he called to inform me that his meetings yesterday went terribly, he was liquidating his business, and he blamed it on bad karma from moving in together.  I feel like I’m his scapegoat.  He didn’t directly blame me but said everything went downhill with both our businesses since he moved in.  I suggested that is he would be happier moving to the other apartment by himself that he should do that, but I didn’t really get an answer.  If he moves into the other apartment full time in the other city, I feel like the relationship will be damaged forever.

He’s coming home tomorrow and I don’t really know how to move forward with all of this.  I know that it’s not my fault but I feel hurt and completely blindsided. 

TL;DR  My boyfriend’s startup is failing and he blames me. "
"[UPDATE] I'm [22F] at my breaking point with my difficult roommate [23F] over a moving-out mess.


Hi! I remembered my old post and figured I’d update since I love updates, especially juicy ones. [Old post is here](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/3a2u58/im_22f_at_my_breaking_point_with_my_difficult/).

Re the moving out situation: I didn’t bring on a subletter, and let her live alone for a month. My plan had been to move to the city and live happily ever after. I was planning on moving into a shared house via a startup called Campus. Literally the day before I was supposed to move, they shuttered their operations. SO, I moved in with my parents because I did NOT want to go back to living with Holly. This worked out well for me financially. After a couple of months I found a new place in the city and moved in there - all was great. Holly renewed her lease with an acquaintance from college who was moving to our area. 

I mentioned that Holly had issues with professionalism - well, Holly ended up getting fired from her job. I reached out to another agency in her industry I knew well, in the same field, to set her up with an interview (ugh, why) and she ended up getting the role. After she got it, I went for coffee with her to talk about it, which was the first time I’d seen her since the move. 

She told me she wasn’t enjoying living with “Emma” because Emma would never invite her to things or be home as much as she originally said she would (shocker). In general, it sounded like Emma dealt with a lot of what I’d dealt with.

Then I brought up something funny, that I’d matched on Tinder with a guy who’d worked with Holly at the agency she’d been let go from. I had met him once at some company thing I’d gone to with her. She immediately asked me to message him and ask him what he thought of her. She told me she’d had the biggest crush on him the whoooole time she’d worked there and that he was The One for her. We left it at that, with her asking me to promise to message him. I said maybe.

Well, I did message him. And we went on a date. She texted me almost every day asking if I’d heard from him and when I finally responded and said we were going out, she became extremely upset. She asked me to make a choice between him or her. She said I was boyfriend stealing, and that I wasn’t a good friend. I wanted to tell her I WASN’T HER FRIEND. So I took her up on her ultimatum, and I chose him over her.

2.5 years later that guy and I live together and have the most gorgeous dog and life. We have a great friend group, great jobs, and our families are so close we’ve all spent Christmas and Thanksgiving together too. He’s so hot and cool. I'm 25 now and he's 29. Our dog is a 1 and a half Aussie!

I’ve never spoken to Holly again, but since my boyfriend is close to his old coworkers (don’t worry, he wasn’t fired) who keep up with Holly on social media, I’ve heard that she moved to L.A. and has cycled through FOUR more companies, each time getting fired. I don’t know much else about her life since she blocked me on every single form of social media INCLUDING VENMO. I’ve never met a person who knew her that didn’t think she was batshit, so that’s validation.

The End.

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR: 10/10 would boyfriend steal again. "
"I [22] found out my boyfriend [21M] does not exist...


i was elaborately catfished. It was all fabricated by a friend i've known for several years. I have both voice and video chatted with this friend, and met many of our mutual friends in person. He involved many other real friends, and used personal knowledge of me to make it seem very real and plausible. 

I began dating this guy long distance under the premise that he was close with my friend. We had plans to meet up soon, and i was really excited to finally see him in person. We talked every day and i developed a lot of feelings towards him. 

I've come to find out that this guy does not exist. All of his pictures and videos were stolen from someone else's social media. He made up entirely new contexts for the pictures and videos and set up backstory in advance so they seemed legitimate. (ex: saying ""I'm going to do XYZ tomorrow!"" then sending a video the next day.)

I interacted with both ""people"" individually and together. We had 3-way group chats. We used software to watch movies online, in which me, my friend, and my ""boyfriend"" were all ""logged in."" he sent me screenshots of text conversations that he had with this guy. It was ALL him. using multiple accounts to talk to me as both my friend and my boyfriend at the same time. he had conversations WITH HIMSELF publicly on social media and in private chats, to create the allusion of two completely separate people. 

this alternate personality joined group chats with my friends. This guy would be participating in the conversation from two different perspectives. He spent MONTHS building up this character to all of my friends before I was even introduced to him, so by the time I ""met"" him, he already had credibility as a legitimate person because all my friends knew him and talked to him. 

He used the fact that I am trans against me. He said that he had dysphoria about his voice and had trouble with phone calls (both things that I have legitimately struggled with) and that he was working in therapy to be able to call me. I was sympathetic to this. (I know that refusing audio/video chat is the biggest red flag. I feel like my sympathy/experience with dysphoria was taken advantage of.) 

I am hurt, lost, confused, and shaken up. I have to grieve the loss of someone I felt very real feelings for, while grappling with the fact that he was never real. He was a mix of my ""friend,"" my friend's imagination, and even my own imagination. I feel incredibly manipulated and taken advantage of. This has messed with my head and made me call into question what is real and what isn't. I feel nauseous thinking about the amount of work that went into faking this entire person's life.

I immediately blocked my friend and his alternate identity on all social media, locked down my accounts, told my friends what happened, and finally confronted him. He admitted that he had been lying and manipulating me, and promised to delete the accounts and stay out of my life. 

However, I am still trying to wrap my brain around this whole thing. I don't know how to cope with this kind of manipulation of reality. I don't know how to grieve the loss of someone who was never real. 

TL;DR: my friend spent a ridiculous amount of time and effort building a fake person, convinced all of my friends he was a real person, and used that to date me with his alternate personality.

"[Update] SOS I (18f) have a crush on my dance instructor (??m) and want to give him something I bought but I'm terrified of making it awkward. Help.


Link to my first post: https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/958b5k/sos_i_18f_have_a_massive_crush_on_my_dance/

Hi all! It's been a while, but I thought I'd toss an update to yall.

First, I'm not trying to woo my dance instructor. I am a teenager. I have a crush. It is my first crush. It is embarrassing. I'll get over it.

I've always given gifts to teachers. I had a woman who was an Aggies fan, I got her a stuffed mascot. Teacher liked the beach, so I got him a little seashell figurine. When I was learning to bake, I brought in stuff for my teachers.

So bringing him gifts from a con did not occur to me as strange. We made food for my first instructer, and students bring in snacks and stuff for theirs.

Anyways, he liked them a lot. At first he was kind of confused, and really surprised when he realized we were giving him presents. He put on the light up sunglasses and did the robot in front of a mirror. It was adorable. When he found the pins, he put them on his shirt and showed them off to the others.

So, I guess it went well.

**TL;Dr** it went well"
"My [18F] family [50M, 47F, 26M, 24F] is unsupportive of me being in college. How can I not let them bring me down?


I'm the first person from my immediate family to go off to college. No one in my family has went to college. 

I'm a Pre-PA student. My family has not been very supportive of me being in school.  Even before I went to college they told me, ""You shouldn't focus on school. You should just get a full-time job (at any place.)"" 

Of course, I didn't listen.

They always told me that I'm book smart, but not street smart.

When I'm studying, they make comments like, ""You study too much. You're such a nerd, etc."" Mind you, I'm a Biology major. I'm taking hard classes. And I don't study 24/7. I do have a part-time job and I am apart of a club.

I just took my first Biology exam in college. I received a 94 on it! When I told my parents, they showed no enthusiasm and didn't care at all.

I wish my family was more supportive of my education. It upsets me when they are so nonchalant towards it. 

I'm trying not to let it bother me, but it's hard.

How can I not let this affect me?

"Newly transitioning sister [19MtF] and youngest sister [16F] are fighting viciously. Youngest now showing signs of anorexia. Mom is absent, but I [27F] want the youngest to live with me for a while to recover, but middle sister feels abandoned.


This is like the mess to end all messes. I've found therapy for both of them for now but I'm still facing an extremely hard choice. I feel guilty no matter what I do. 

&amp;#x200B;

My youngest sister is my half-sister from my mom's second marriage. Our mother is a mess. Always has been. She's essentially a functioning alcoholic but she'll disappear for nights on end. We're all used to it but you really can't depend on her for anything. 

&amp;#x200B;

Anyways, our middle sister, Ashley, came out to us as MtF 2 years ago and started HRT last year when she turned 18. It's been roughly a year since then. We've all tried our best to be supportive but it's been difficult. Ashley is filled with a lot of anger and resentment towards our mother and her life in general. I've helped find her some good therapists to aid her progress but she doesn't seem to think it helps. I'm a bit lost what to do and doctors have advised it's likely just the hormones and will be temporary while the body adjusts. She's almost regressed in a way to become like a 13-14 teenage girl in terms of emotional regulation. 

&amp;#x200B;

So some months ago Ashley started picking fights with our youngest half-sister, Chloe, for no reason whatsoever. I didn't know about it at first since I live like 30 min away and come home only every 2 weeks or so. I heard it first from my mom, who only passively mentioned that Ashley has been picking on Chloe. Then I heard their actual fighting one weekend which was incredibly nasty. Chloe was getting ready to meet her boyfriend, doing her makeup in the bathroom, when Ashley goes in to get something and they just start screaming. I run in and Chloe yells that Ashley told her she looked like a drugged up prostitute. 

&amp;#x200B;

I start coming home more often and I'd see the same things over and over again. Ashley antagonising Chloe for various things. Calling her hair ""greasy,"" her teeth ""yellow,"" or just the plain old ""you know you're getting really fat"" at all times. I can't remember the number of times I told Ashley to knock it off and apologise but honestly it's like trying to mediate fights between angry cats. They are dead-set on fighting. 

&amp;#x200B;

A few weeks ago I took Chloe out for ice cream because I hadn't seen her in a while. She always seemed to be staying late at school or breaking curfew to hang out with her boyfriend. I was worried. She picked at her food and I noticed that she was wearing heavy clothes (WAY too heavy for August) and that her wrist was much thinner than I remembered. Towards the end I took a quick selfie of us and she was so angry and wanted me to delete the picture immediately. She started crying and scratching at my hands trying to get my phone. People were looking and we left for home quickly. 

&amp;#x200B;

After a long chain of meetings/phone calls/hospital visits, we are told Chloe has developed signs of anorexia nervosa but needs further monitoring and therapy. She has been skipping meals, forcing herself to throw up, or will fast for days. She somehow got rid of all the mirrors in her room. Chloe has completely changed as well personality wise. She used to be very bubbly, happy go lucky type of girl but now she's reserved unless irritated or will burst out in tears like when we had ice cream. 

&amp;#x200B;

So now I'm facing a really tough decision: multiple doctors and therapists have told us that given the particular situation, it would be best to separate Ashley and Chloe for a while for both of them to recover without being in the other's company. I talked it over with my boyfriend and we want to invite Chloe to live with us for a few months. The reason being that Chloe's health has become very, very precarious (she hasn't had her period for a few months, her nails will splinter and fall out, her hair is thinning drastically) and I want to be there to monitor her eating. I know my mom won't be able to do it well. 

&amp;#x200B;

However, Ashley sees this as a full abandonment. She desperately also wants to come live with me and my boyfriend but I just feel like Chloe is in a worse situation health-wise. I know our mom isn't the best support, but I promised Ashley I'd visit every weekend for as long as needed. Ashley is acting out like predicted, getting violent in the home (with furniture not people) and flat out ignoring my calls. I feel so guilty, but I don't know what else to do. They NEED to be separated, and unfortunately we don't have any other family Ashley could go live with. What do I do? Am I making the right choice? Am I failing Ashley?

&amp;#x200B;

**TLDR: Both of my sisters desperately need my help and attention. One is going through HRT (MtF transitioning) and the other has stopped eating and shown signs of anorexia. I want to invite the anorexic sister to live with me and my boyfriend so we can monitor her health. My MtF sister feels abandoned and is now acting out. Am I making the right choice? What else can I do?**"
"My [22M] former SIL [34F] moved to Oregon today with my nephew and niece [2M &amp; 5F]. My parents [70] have gone full meltdown and our just making chances for communication worse.


Lucy, who is my former sister in law, moved to Oregon today. That is pretty far away from where my family and I live. She felt like herself and the kids needed a fresh start. You probably wondering what happened and it's a long story. I will try to break it down to a short story. 

My brother was willing to do anything for, Lucy. He knew full well she wanted to be a mother, I mean, she's a teacher for god sake. She use to coach girls for sport after school. He agreed to have kids even though he had no interest in having them, but never told her. Well, it came out that my brother wanted to divorce and live with another women. He's paying child support because it's legally required, but he wants to start a fresh start in life. Lucy decided it would be best to move back to Oregon where her family is with the kids. She posted a video of the kids running around their new home wanting to pick their rooms. They seem excited. 

My parents have done nothing but piss Lucy off ever since she said they were moving.  My parents keep doubling down. My mom posted a message on her Facebook saying how heartless Lucy was before she moved. Lucy told them to keep it up and they won't be seeing the kids at all. Lucy said we could still see the kids if we visit, but my parents are just pissing her off. And I feel like we're going to lose the kids forever if they keep going. 

What do you recommenced I do? 

**TL;DR: Parents are not taking grandchildren moving away well and I feel like we'll lose the kids forever if they keep going.**"
"My [23M] socially awkward roommate [25?M] is starting to creep me out - moving is not an option


Transferred to new school, moved to new apartment complex on campus, meant for students. Not a dorm but similar (random roommate that is also a student). I'm on a one year lease that started in August, changing rooms is not an option. Luckily I have my own room with a bathroom and everything, but there is a shared living space with a kitchen.

Posted about this earlier, has gotten worse. Summary of the weird shit my new roommate did that I mentioned in that post:

----

1. First time I meet him, he invites me on a trip to Vegas within 15 minutes of meeting him. After that he started asking me a bunch of really weird/creepy questions about how to talk to women and how to get them to hook up with you

----

2. First day of me moving in he insists that I throw a party on Friday. I told him I don't want to, but he carries on acting as if this hypothetical party is actually thing, keeps on asking me about the plans and who I'm going to invite. I had to tell him 4 or 5 times that I'm not throwing a party. After that he insisted that I ""at least invite 3 girls over.""

----

3. Sometimes I hear him through the walls loudly talking to himself. One time I heard him shouting the same phrase over and over again for about an hour (no idea what he was saying, different language). Also, in general he has no social awareness and is super awkward to talk to.

----

4. Every Friday and Saturday night when I come home he is still up just sitting on the couch drinking alone, and every time he basically starts interrogating me on what I was doing that night. Not in a friendly way asking about how my night was, he sounds like a cop talking to a suspect, ""what were you doing tonight!?"" , and he keeps pressing for details.

----

Anyway last night he just went way over the top. I came home at around 130 AM and it was the same drill of him interrogating me about my night. I was clearly annoyed by him and not really answering, but I think he's pretty much just completely clueless. After that he started begging me come downtown with him just to walk around and ""talk to girls."" I had to tell him no 20+ times but he just wouldn't shut up about it, and would act all sad everytime I said no. He even told me that he would only go if I came with him. After repeatedly telling him no over and over again, he started to just make shit up to try to convince me to go with him. His lies were just so nonsensical and contradictory, I don't how he actually expected me to believe this stupid shit. 

Anyway, at first I just thought this guy was socially awkward and annoying, but now he is actually starting to creep me out. Any advice for dealing with people like this ? Keep in mind that I'm on a one year lease, I'm stuck being this guy's roommate for another year, there's no way around that. I just have to figure out a way to deal with this guy. 

------

TL;DR: new roommate is socially awkward, annoying, and really creepy. Moving is not an option. Help.

"My boyfriend [26 M] thinks that it's unethical, that my friends and I [24 F] use ""family plans"" to save money on a lot of stuff



My 4 closest friends and I are all really reliable with money, I trust all of them to pay me back for anything that we split the cost of. We all started taking advantage of ""family plans"" for various services despite being unrelated. For example, we share one Amazon account. We have family plans on Netflix and Spotify. We all share one ""fuel discount"" account, and alternate who gets the discount each month. The fuel rewards level up a lot, the more you spend at the grocery chain, so 5 people on an account gets us better discounts than each of us having our own. We got ourselves a ""family plan"" to our local gym, and during the summer, go as a ""family"" to the local pool. My friends who game share their Steam libraries. One of my friends and I have a family plan for our cell phones.

We joke about being sisters / stepsisters / adopted sisters, or something. It's funny because I'm an irish redhead, one of my friends is asian, and another is half asian and dyes her hair pastel pink, one's black, and one's white but super tan. We couldn't look any more different.

It never felt too unethical, we were all tight on money to various degrees during college and while starting out with our professional lives. And so many things are set up for couples, or families, to get the best deal, rather than single people. So what was the harm in becoming a family?
We've been doing this for years, starting in college and there haven't been any issues with someone not paying their fair share. Venmo makes it really easy to handle shared bills, whenever one of us gets a bill, we just request everyone's share of the cost. Every time, I've been paid back within the day.

----

I mentioned some of this stuff casually to my boyfriend of 5 months, James. First, I think I mentioned something about being happy it was my turn to use the fuel discount, because my friends and I had spent enough on groceries this month to fill my tank of gas for free. He asked how we'd managed that, and I said that the five of us had a family plan for fuel discounts through a chain of grocery stores and gas stations. And that the rewards compound the more you spend, so it was a better deal to all go in as a ""family""

Another time, I was figuring out with my friends whether we should extend the swimming pool membership for one more month, and I mentioned that it would probably be worth it, because it would be just over 10 dollars each, and we'd probably go a few times. My boyfriend asked how we'd got the membership so cheap, he had bought membership in the past and it was 60 dollars a month. I said that we all got a family membership, and split it five ways.

He asked me adter that how much stuff we signed up for as a ""family"" and I gave him the whole list. I told him that I was saving at least 1500 dollars a year, doing this.

He was shocked to hear that, I think. That I was saving that much. 

Last weekend, he started telling me how unethical it all was, that we were using stuff meant for families. That those kinds of deals exist so people can get their kids on their phone plans, or to the pool, or something, without spending exorbitantly. And that people like me, with only myself to support, rather than kids or a stay at home spouse, are not the people those things are meant for.

I was kinda surprised he said that, it's not like I'm loaded with cash, or any of my friends are. And it didn't seem like we were doing anything too wrong. A lot of people I know do that on a smaller scale, like sharing Netflix passwords in college.

But he was super against me and my friends taking advantage of family plan discounts. And I admit he's right, it's misleading to call my unrelated friends my family, but it seems generally harmless overall. He really disagrees, and it just seems a little crazy that this has become such a big disagreement between us. He literally keeps bringing it up, when I use my gym membership or swimming pool membership, or Amazon, or anything.

Is he right that I'm doing something unethical? Or is it no big deal? If it's really not a big deal, how do I convince him to lay off?

TLDR - I get family plans with my friends who I am not related to, to save money. My boyfriend thinks we're doing something unethical.

"How do I [21F] set boundaries with my professor [60s?M] who wants me to quit my job to work on his class?


I have to take a senior level design class to graduate. I cannot stress how one sided and unfair this class is to students. We get 4 credits for the class however we are expected to put in 20+ hours a week to work on our projects, which the university sells to private companies for a crap ton of money. We also sign extensive NDAs so the university/companies completely own us for the year. There's even a clause stating that students may not launch start-ups or apply for patents while in this class and that if we violate this, the university is entitled to our IP. While it is a crappy situation, it's not uncommon and we all just have to get through it. 

The man who runs the class is also a total jerk. He talks to us like we're children and he'll set an expectation, not tell any one what that expectation is, and get pissy when it isn't met. If he has an issue with someone, he will send out an email to all 52 students in the class essentially sub tweeting the person(s) he has the problem with. 

Now I can handle him most of the time. The one thing that I'm having a difficult time with is how he regards work. I have two part time jobs which I rely on for my living expenses, neither of which are at all relevant to my major. One of our homework assignments was to create an Excel sheet with our schedule for the semester, specifically allocating time to work on this class. The professor requested ""12-20 hours a week,"" which I have set aside in my schedule. A few days after we submitted our schedules, the professor sent out an email along the lines of:

&gt;Students should not take on any part time jobs this year! If students must work, they must be working at an internship or doing research!! I am very disappointed at the number of seniors who think their part time jobs are more important than their future career! All students must consider this class as a stepping stone to bigger things!!!

Excuse me what? This request is so ridiculous and condescending that I do not even want to validate it with a response. How can I establish now that my working hours are not up for debate? 

TL;DR: My professor wants me to quit my job so he can better wh0re me out for my university. How can I politely tell him to piss off? "
"My (34m) gf (31f) lied about where she went to college


TL:DR Don't know what to do, can't see a way to confront without destroying trust, confronting after the fact would seem petty and useless.  I don't see a way around this and my head is full of conspiracies.

&amp;#x200B;

My girlfriend has always been extremely secretive.  Living together over a year, I've never met any friends or family of hers.  She doesn't have any friends.  She earns her money off passive investments but lives productively - ie we don't even own a tv.  She is a huge snob about always performing at the highest levels and she went to one of the top schools in America for undergrad and a masters before we met.  For example, I went to an extremely good school but I regularly get insulted by her for not trying hard enough and settling for less - that I should have worked harder and went her university.

A year ago I came across some files I most certainly knew I wasn't supposed to have access to at all.  She never lets me see old photos of her and seeing some on there, I put them on a jump drive.  I knew it was a huge trust violation but I justified it because I thought she'd just be embarrassed having me see photos of her in college because she got a boob job after university.

I basically forgot about that and recently came across it again and decided to take another look at her.  I saw a resume among the files and I was very curious to see that because she never worked a day in her life.  I open it up and to my shock she lists herself as a graduate of a second or third tier state university and actively pursuing a graduate degree at another university - a good one but still unequivocally beneath my own in prestige.  Thing is, the date of undergraduate graduation would put her as much older than what her IDs and passport claim so now I'm further intrigued.  

I look through the rest of the files and find some transcripts, apparently she dropped out after a single semester at the state school and had applied to complete undergraduate school at the one she listed as graduate school on her resume.  I found a number of registration forms for non-degree and online course programs from the school she claimed to attend.  That's where the paper trail ended.  So she lied to say she graduated and was in grad school in the resume and to me she lied about where she went to school.  All I know is she started school at a place she never told me about and don't know if she even finished college.

Thing is, while her falsified education was definitely something that attracted me, it was never a deal breaker to date a dropout.  In fact, I still view her as incredibly intelligent, she is without a doubt the most well read person I've ever known.  We're also incredibly compatible, view many things in similar terms and she's stunningly gorgeous.  But now, I need to question everything, now I when I look at those old photos, I'm seeing different facial structures as well and beginning to think maybe she got more than just a boob job.  She's still beautiful in those other images, but it's a much homelier girl next door beauty rather than a statuesque goddess I see today.

Ever since coming across that information, I can't really look nor view her the same. I keep wondering what else she is hiding, what else she will hide in the future and what lengths she'll go to continue hiding the truth.  Is this why I haven't met her family? Is this why I never met anyone that knows her?  We live abroad, so a lot of that was explained that way but now my mind is full of conspiracy theories.  I don't even know if she actually owns the businesses she actually claims she owns.  Maybe she's not from an absurdly wealthy family and just living off some finite inheritance or insurance settlement.  I really don't know anything about her now that I think about it.

I understand how she could have told me one thing at the beginning only to feel committed to it later, it's possible she feels trapped in her lies.  But I just can't get over the fact she could live with me for over a year and not once come clean.  I've tried numerous times to pry away asking things where it would give a spot to come out and she just sticks with it.  If I am too forceful, she'll know I invaded her privacy.  She would also know I'd only have access over a year ago - so it would also mean I sat on that info for over a year in her mind.  I don't see any way to confront without going nuclear.  I still probably wouldn't be able to trust her nor could she trust me, I don't see how that helps anything.

It would also be extra humiliating for her because she's taken such a strong stance on working your hardest and only going to the top school possible.  This wouldn't just be showing her I know about her lies but also exposing her as incompetent in her mind.

Looking for thoughts.

"My dad [54m] offered my boyfriend [23m] money to dump me [21f]. Is this real life?


I’m rather angry right now, and not thinking straight, I think, so I could use a little help in processing what I am supposed to do now.

I am currently attending college. And I met a boy here, as one does. I have been dating this wonderful boy for nine months and I am absolutely crazy about him!

My boyfriend and I wound up both having today off from classes and work, and I already planned on visiting home for the long weekend. Since we have been together the better part of a year, I went ahead and asked my mom and dad if I could go ahead and bring the boyfriend along. Mom and dad said they would be happy to have him.

Now, I have been a *little* nervous about bringing home my boyfriend around my family. There are some strange cultural things at play. My parents still cling to the idea of “Southern Gentry.” They like to think of us as some old Southern family and they hold on to alot of outdated values based on that (perhaps if there are any Southerners reading this, you’ll know the type of person I am talking about?). 

At any rate, they always imagined me marrying some young Southern gentleman, blah blah. To my detriment, I more or less went along with it until I met my now-boyfriend. He’s not Southern, which I knew would be strike one against him in my parent’s eyes. He’s not much of a traditionalist, so that is strike two.

But he is also insanely smart (working on a Master’s and a goal of PhD). He dresses well and is approximately the most nice and polite person you’ll ever meet, so I was hopeful that my parents could see past their prejudices and take him as he is.

We got here this morning, and it felt......strained. My mom took to my boyfriend well enough, but I could tell dad didn’t care for him. Such is life, I figured, we’ll get through the weekend and that would be that.

After lunch, my dad asked me to help mom with some stuff and he said he wanted to chat with the boyfriend. I assumed it was the usual “dad talk”. I figured one was coming and had warned my boyfriend on the drive over that it would probably be easiest just to grin and bear it when it came.

They disappeared for a while. When they came back, they were *both* angry. Neither one would talk and they were clearly avoiding one another. I pulled the boyfriend away for a private moment just to ask what had happened.

My boyfriend said my dad offered him a significant sum of money to break up with me. I had to ask him to repeat what he said because it sounded so ridiculous. After I confirmed my hearing still worked I stormed into the living room and asked dad face-to-face if he had offered my boyfriend money to leave me.

Dad told me simply “Yes I did.”

I was so incredibly hurt and shocked by those three words that I yelled for the boyfriend to go grab our stuff and we headed out to the car. 

After just having drive me around my hometown for a bit we eventually settled on staying the night in a cheap motel (we previously planned on staying at my parents)

Boyfriend obviously didn’t take the money, and has been wonderfully sympathetic. But I think he found my family a little overwhelming because when I ask him what he thinks he should do he says this is something way out of his wheelhouse.

So now I am sitting here on a lumpy bed and trying to block out the AC, and I do not know what to say or what to do.

My mom tried calling to calm me down. She agreed that what dad did was stupid, but she says his heart was in the right place. I told her I’d speak to him if he apologizes, but her response was “Well, you know your father...” meaning “Don’t hold your breath...”

What do I do? This is unacceptable, right?!? I figured there would be a little friction between the Dad and boyfriend, but this so far beyond utterly ridiculous that I don’t think I can wrap my mind around it.

What do I even say to Dad next time I see him? What is an acceptable apology for something like that? 

TL;DR: Dad tried to pay off my boyfriend to dump me. What the hell?"
"My friend [F28] believes she caught me [F31] cheating on my husband [M33] and told all our mutual friends.


A little background; my husband and I fell into a group of friends a couple of years ago. We are a little older than most of the people and the only couple, so we aren't particularly close, but we all participate in a sport and do a lot of trips to play, so we tend to spend a lot of time together in the fall/winter. This is where we met Sarah, the friend who thinks I am an adulterer. 

A couple of months ago, I ran into Sarah while getting coffee with my friend Alex [M30]. At our next practice, Sarah made a couple of comments about how cute Alex was and jokingly asked if there was anything going on between us or if she could ""hop on that horse."" Sarah tends to jump from guy to guy and she isn't the nicest to her partners. Alex is a very sensitive guy, so I didn't think it would be a good fit. I told Sarah as much and she got pissed at me. This isn't too unusual, so I just brushed it off and after a week everything seemed back to normal. 

Up to last night. I was out getting drinks with Alex as he has been having a rough time (he was laid off from his job 6 months ago and just had to leave his apartment - he's currently living with us while he gets that straightened out). I was comforting him and apparently, Sarah was there and took a couple of pictures of us and sent them to a group chat that my husband and I are not a part of.

Normally, everyone knows Sarah's tendencies. But my husband is out of town and a couple of team members came by this morning to pick me up and Alex was there. This was when they told me about Sarah's texts and basically said they won't tell my husband *wink wink*. 

They will not believe me. The team has basically split into two groups - people who hate me for being a cheater and are threatening to tell him (to which I say - PLEASE do!), and people who think it's hilarious. I've told my husband and he also thinks it is funny, but when he texted the group to tell them Alex is just a friend, they told him he doesn't have all the info. 

I am worried that this is going to be a long-term problem and I do not know how to fix it. My husband and I have been talking about retiring from the sport, but we wanted to do one more season. This is starting to feel like a good reason to call it quits right now. 

TL;DR : A friend saw me out twice with the same friend and has convinced all of our mutual friends that we are sleeping together. "
"I am fuming. My (24 F) husband (28F) has loads of missed FB calls from a random girl and suggestive messages.


I want to set the world on fucking fire right now.

My husband has a string of Facebook missed calls and messages (print &amp; voice) from a random girl on Facebook whom I’ve never met. 

They aren’t friends on Facebook and there are no outgoing calls on his end. The calls/messages start in June and he’s never responded. My FB has been deactivated for ages btw. 

• First one says: “Hey ___. Hope I see you soon” with a smiley face. Followed by a ton of missed calls. 

• Then a voice note saying to call her back that and that she’s been thinking about him. (WTF)

• More missed calls spread out over two months

• Then a voice note that says: “Call me back. I know you remember me.” She sounds annoyed in the last voice note and it sent CHILLS down my spine. 

I hate to be THAT girl who rudely points out another person’s looks but she is like 40ish and she is not easy on the eyes, and I’m actually in shock and I feel like my heart is going to explode. 

I don’t want to think the worst but.....Could she be an old lover? We’ve been married for almost 2 years. I had to go outside to get air and i haven’t done that in like years. 

WHY IS THIS WOMAN CONTACTING MY HUSBAND. And what does she want? What do I do? 


TD;LR! My (24F) husband (28F) is getting random missed calls on FB from a woman I don’t know and her messages are suggestive. What the fuck does she want from my husband??? OMG"
"My coworker/friend (22M)'s fiancee (24F) is harassing me (23F) about our interactions, accusing me of stealing him


Tl;Dr: I'm friends with a co-worker outside of work, we recently went on a work trip. She's decided I'm a threat and is calling and threatening to show up to my apartment to ""discuss"" this, driving me out if social situations. What should I do to preserve my working and personal relationships?

I started my current job about 1.5 years ago. I love it. We do design work and I have recently been put in charge of a big project. To help me, my boss assigned one of our interns, John, to help me do testing on the current product. John and I ended up spending lots of time together and figuring out we had many common interests including shows and music. There was a group of us that went out for drinks once a week so I invited John to join. He brought his fiancee Jane along as well. I met her in July and thought she was alright. They've been together for 6 years and got engaged in July. 

Jane and I sort of became friends. She texts me. They came for drinks every week along with John. I visited their apartment because they have a really cute dog. They visited my apartment for food and board games. These were all group activities. 

Recently, John and I were sent on an overnight work trip to visit a customer using our product. Jane wasn't a fan of this as she and John are rarely apart. John also has apparently never had female friends before me. The trip went off without a hitch and we returned home very late Wednesday night. Apparently, to surprise John, Jane had adopted a puppy in addition to their existing dog. The next day, John and I had to see a second customer and so we spent the day travelling again. 

That morning before leaving, Jane texted me about the new dog and I made a comment saying I'd have to come see him. I mentioned I'd be dropping John off after our trip, so maybe I'd stop in then. She got very aggressive, saying ""well that's fine I guess John doesn't want to spend any time with and it doesn't matter I haven't talked to him all week but ok come over I guess"" which seemed excessive. I replied saying that I meant I'd briefly say hi when I dropped him off before she got home, or I could come by another time. I didnt want to intrude. John had invited me. She replied saying she shouldn't have to deal with me to spend time with HER fiance. Emphasis hers. 

Anyway, trip goes well again. We get back. Go to see the dog. She's home early. Tries to lock out John, then takes the dogs and leaves slamming the door. I take the hint and bolt. John tells me not to worry. I go home to take a nap and she calls me, sobbing about how I'm taking her fiance and put myself in her shoes and see how mad it makes her that he defends me and I've been saying and doing things to irritate her around him since we met. I have NO IDEA what she's talking about. She mentioned that John confronted her about a time I thought she was being passive aggressive to me. She said that him being mad at her about it was unfair because she wasn't being passive aggressive and I should have known that from a Snapchat. She also said on the call she wanted to come and talk and I don't want her here. She also has basically uninvited me to any social events with John and implied that she's not ok with us even working together. 

How do I proceed to keep my personal life and work life stable? I hate this high school bullshit and want nothing to do with it. John is the first friend I've made in this new state (besides my boyfriend) and so I was very happy to find someone with similar interests. How do I reassure her that I'm not stealing him? Sorry this is so long."
"My (F 31) BF (31) drunkenly told me that he believes he was meant to be the equivalent of Julius Caesar/Genghis Khan/Napoleon and he feels life is meaningless because he will never acheive this. I think he has some mental issues.


I am aware that some people have delusions of grandeur, but this was something almost frightening. 

My boyfriend of 4 years has been a bit of a late bloomer career wise but is on his way to getting masters in physician assistant science, so it's not as though he is going nowhere. 

Over the weekend, he got drunk and a bit belligerent, and ended up knocking a friend over and breaking glass all over the floor. After the melee I took him home, and being sober, didn't really want to get into an argument so I said nothing about it but he went on and on about how he wasn't wrong and how men should just ""get it"" and not get hurt or upset when he is ""joking"" with them. He repeated over and over that his friend is weak and he is stronger/smarter than everyone. This lead on and odd tangent about how he was born in the wrong time and to the wrong family, how he should have been born to royalty or some high ranked family in ancient Rome and he would have been better and achieved more than Genghis Khan or Julius Caesar. I was trying not to laugh when he was very seriously and earnestly explaining this to me. Ive never heard of a more ridiculous thing. My BF was born to a very upper middle class family. They paid for his college, they took him on amazing vacations every year growing up, he wanted for nothing. He was born into a family that has given him the opportunity to choose 3 careers, and finally settle on one at age of 30. He was almost in tears telling me how he felt like he was a loser, who cared that he can eventually become a doctor, it doesn't matter, his life is bullshit, etc. 

My point is, he has these delusions that he is so great at everything, so much smarter than everyone, so much stronger than everyone (smarter than Julius Caesar??) And to me, he has done hardly anything with all of this opportunity. 

I don't know if I should mention this too him. He didn't mention it the next day. I feel like it is a serious character defect to be so obsessed with yourself and to consider yourself this caliber of person when you've achieved hardly anything on your own (not that I hold it against him personally). I also feel that he will try to fill this unfillable void with something else (sexual conquests?) And I am not trying to marry someone like that. 

So, should I bring it up? Should I try to steer him into another direction/realize that he should be grateful for what he has? 

Is he crazy? 

*TLDR* BF has delusions of grandeur, is otherwise fairly normal. Believes his life is worth nothing if he doesn't achieve the historical significance of Napoleon. I think he has deeper seeded issues. "
"Boyfriend (M27) gets 200+ messages a day from a female friend (F27).


This is a weird situation. My boyfriend has a female friend he’s known casually for about 4 years but only really started to get to know better in the last year or so. She lives in the same city my boyfriend and I (I am 24, BTW) live in. Every day, starting early morning and going until midnight, she messages my boyfriend on Facebook Messenger literally hundreds of times per day about what she’s doing. That means his phone and computer are constantly going off.

When I noticed how many messages my boyfriend was getting from this one person I politely asked what she was saying, and he said “all sorts of stuff. Nothing really, it’s pretty boring,” and I was still curious so I did something bad and peeked into his phone to see what she was saying. My boyfriend wasn’t lying - it’s really all insignificant stuff, totally platonic. She tells him occasional celebrity news, stuff about her work, what she’s eating for lunch, plans she has with friends, etc. She volunteers all this info, too — boyfriend doesn’t ask how she’s doing, what she’s up to, etc. She messages in a spree (sending 5-10 messages in a row) often and my boyfriend reads them but doesn’t message back as much as she does, and what he messages is just like “loooool” or “yeah /:” or “that sucks, sorry.” 

So their convos are platonic and it feels like I shouldn’t be so annoyed about this to post it on Reddit, but why do I feel like something is still kind of off about this situation? My boyfriend said the conversations are boring, plus he doesn’t really engage with her that much, but why does she keep sending so many messages a day? And since the messages are about “nothing,” is it ok for me to ask my boyfriend to tell his friend to stop sending so many messages a day? And if so, how would I approach that situation since his friend isn’t disrespecting the relationship and there was no inappropriate stuff being said? 

I’m at a loss. 

TL;DR: boyfriend has a friend who sends 200+ messages a day. "
"Red Flag? GF [28/F] of 3 months has never had a friend. Should I [27/M] worry?


  

Throwaway because I do not want this traced back to me. 

I’ve been dating “Kate” for 3 months. As for background on how we met:

I’m a super extrovert and worked in sales for years, so I can pretty much talk to anyone anytime about anything. I now work in a different field entirely and recently finished school after going back. I took a contract right out of my program for 2 months to carry me until my FT job started (a couple weeks ago), which is where I met Kate. Kate is an analyst and we worked closely together for my four-month stint. We hit it off but kept it very professional at work until after I left. We made arrangements to go for coffee, I asked her out, convinced her of the merits of a date with me and for three months we’ve been inseparable. I work close to our old office, so we always find time to grab lunch – she often goes out of her way to make one for me and we find a nice, quiet out-of-the-way place. We talk a mile-a-minute and then reconvene after work. 

Kate and I have a really great thing. I always knew she was an introvert. She is very open about that. When we first started dating, she'd make vague references to friends/events/places she was going but as it turns out it was vague references to make me think she isn't odd. Early on, we attended a party and she was only there because I love being social. I love hanging out with people and going to social events but also really love quiet time. I’m not a party animal, so quiet weekends spent at home are lovely. Kate and I have compromised on our going out vs. staying in and I think have a good balance. Honestly, 3 months in and this is the best relationship I have EVER had. We've talked about her introversion and she's told me she's very content being home if I want to go out. I actually went out on Friday with friends while she did her own thing and we met up at her place later and she was definitely very content with how things played out. 

Except she has no friends. Like none. I don’t mean like 1 distant friend or a couple of acquaintances. I mean NO friends. Her Facebook is mostly people she only knows very tangentially, either through school or work. Her texts are to her mom or her older sister. I found this out over dinner with her family – we went out last night to a restaurant of her parent’s choosing to have a first “meet and greet” her family are hosting a big family BBQ this weekend and Kate wanted us to get to know one another before things kicked off. Dinner was great, her family were lovely and they were happy that she seems happy. She was very affectionate the whole meal and told me how happy she was that we were getting along. It went great until her sister (who is a few years older) said: “ahhh, you’ve been adopted by an extrovert. Maybe now you’ll have your first friend.” The look of horror crossed everyone face. I think her sister was trying to be funny but Kate &amp; her parents immediately froze and it became tense. Sensing my cue, I went to pee. 

Things were better after I returned. That night Kate invited her self to my place - I was thinking it was for sexy times, but she wanted to be totally honest with me: she’s never really had a friend. Ever. She doesn’t know why but she doesn’t form attachments easily and that she found people never wanted to be her friend or seemed to care about her. From every interaction I’ve had, I don’t see a problem. She’s caring and thoughtful, I’ve seen her cry (at a movie), she certainly has passions, interests and likes/dislikes. We’ve formed an emotional bond and she’s very emotionally available. But from kindergarten through university and until now she's never had a friend. She tearfully told me she was never invited to parties or birthdays as a kid. She would bribe people to spend time with her. She never had friends in high school or university. She’s dated, she was very collegiate with the people at work, but it’s true – they never included her in anything. 

Kate seems incredibly normal – she’s friendly, funny, she's really good looking… she isn’t loud or brash or rude. She isn’t pushy or anything. We’ve been dating 3 months so maybe I have honeymoon goggles on, but is this incredibly weird? Has anyone experienced dating someone who literally has no friends beyond her family? Like I don't think I've ever met someone who literally never had a friend before. Has anyone experienced anything like this? Is this a serious red flag? I don't feel like it is, but maybe I have no perspective?

&amp;#x200B;

tl;dr GF of 3 months has no friends. Has never had a friend. Has no social life. She seems mostly content with her life but I'm worried that someone who seems totally normal has never, ever had a friend before. I mean literally never. Is this red flag run away territory? Is this normal?"
"My [17F] best friend [18F] is trans [MtF]. I recently found a blog of hers where she made fun of my appearance. Now she's begging me to forget it and blaming it on hormones. What should I do?


Hi all, I'm not sure if this is the right subreddit to post this to or if I should go somewhere else. I'm just looking for some advice because the past week has been so painful. We're both seniors in high school. 

&amp;#x200B;

So Alice and I have been friends since 4th grade and best friends since middle school. We're both sort of outcast types and don't have a ton of other friends beyond each other. Alice came out as trans two years ago and has started taking some hormones last year. I don't think it's as much as she'd like but her parents refuse to give her the full dosage so she's been fighting with them for the past year too. I know life has been tough for her so I've tried my hardest to be supportive however I could. 

&amp;#x200B;

Anyways last week I got a random message from this girl that I'm not really friends with. She used to be friends with Alice but they had a falling out over reasons I didn't know fully. The message was a link to this blog (I'm not going to mention the actual site here) and just ""you should read this."" I was curious so I opened it and didn't really get it at first. It wasn't in Alice's real name, but since she referenced very specific things we did (go to the beach on x day and did x thing) I knew she was talking about us. 

&amp;#x200B;

I felt weird reading it since it felt like a private diary but she also had a lot of people commenting and discussing things with her, so I just assumed it was a public but anonymous thing. Well, the worst entry was one she wrote a few months ago specifically about me. She said she felt angry that I once had a boyfriend and she didn't, especially because I was so ""unfortunate"" looking. She posted a picture that was cropped from my fb. You can't really see my face but only my profile. It wasn't a great picture. I was kinda hunched over because I was laughing at something and my hair looked wild and blurry. She then said a lot of things like if she weren't transgender she probably won't need to hang out with already ugly girls and still be the ugly friend of the group. I mean, I guess some of it was self-deprecating but it was so so mean towards me. She also said I had the looks of a walrus and all the grace of one too. I'm overweight, so this really stung. 

&amp;#x200B;

I confronted Alice over this and we fought because she said I shouldn't have read her blog because it wasn't meant for me to read. I'm confused, because I told her she had so many replies and links and likes and whatever, but she said I broke her trust by reading it without telling her. Then when I said I read what she wrote about me she started crying and saying that she's just frustrated and I wasn't supposed to see those. We haven't talked since, but she's started to beg other mutual friends of ours to talk to me. So now I get nonstop calls and messages telling me that I'm overreacting and can't I see what I'm doing to Alice and how she needs my support? They're also telling me that Alice says she blames it all on her hormones which made her extra irritable and moody. I understand that. But those types of posts about me also stretch on for months in varying meanness. There must be some real hatred in there right? I know it wasn't all imaginary. 

&amp;#x200B;

What do I do? I'm still so hurt and honestly really self-conscious knowing hundreds of internet people were laughing at me and pictures of me. I don't know what to do. All our friends think I'm overreacting and the only real asshole for ignoring Alice. What do I do?

&amp;#x200B;

**Tldr: Best friend posted incredibly mean things about me (my looks, my weight) on an anonymous but public blog. She blames it on hormones (she's MtF) and that I was never supposed to read those entries. Mutual friends now telling me I'm overreacting and to forgive her. I'm still so hurt and don't know what to do?**"
"My [30M] husband wants to drive my [23F] new luxury car-


BUT he is the death of cars. 

Here's the back story. When we first got together over 5 years ago, he had a brand new car and I had a beat up commuter car that we drove (in that order) for a couple of years. 
Finally, we sold my crap car for a measly $800 and put a down payment on a ""new to me"" car that was only one year model newer as his previously new car.

I keep my cars immaculate. I park in the back of the parking lot. Car wash, details, regular check ups. The whole 9 yards. He does not. The inside of his car is always disgusting and full of trash. He squeezes into the tiniest of spaces in the front of the lots. He drives 30+ mph down horrible condition bumpy dirt road hills. He... just doesn't care for his cars to the extent that I do mine.

With that being said, I got to drive my new car for a measly 6 months. My mother ended up giving us her '07 minivan that was not in the best shape- high mileage, etc. Of course we were very grateful for the free car and thanked her over and over. We have kids so it was nice to have something bigger. 

But then came the issue. We had 3 cars. We didn't need 3 cars by any means, we didn't want to pay insurance on 3 cars. So we came to the conclusion. We would sell his car, and keep my car and the van. 
My car got a lot more gas mileage than the van. Like 15mpg compared to 45mpg. So naturally, my new car became my husband's car since he has an hour and a half drive to work every day. 
I was semi-fine with that. I knew that meant I'd be driving the old mini van everywhere. I knew that meant he would probably tear the car up. BUT- I also knew that meant when it came time to get a newer car in a couple of years, it would be my car. 

So- fast forward a couple years and it's time to get a new car. The mini van is breaking down and falling apart, extremely high mileage, etc. 
My previously ""new car"" that had been my husband's now for 2 or so years. It was how I expected. Torn up. Completely trashed on the inside, disgusting. Bumpers falling off, fog lights busted, tail light busted, bottom panel completely fell off, scratches, door dings, the whole thing. Not surprised.

So 2 weeks ago we went and traded in the van for a new luxury vehicle, the one we have been talking about getting me for a while. Of course I'm over the moon, it's my dream vehicle and I've been stuck driving beaters for over half a decade. We were finally in the position to do it, and we have already talked about getting him his dream vehicle in 2 years when it will be time to upgrade his car. 

So here's where the problem is. He's already talking about driving my car to work once a week. Anytime he has a day off, he wants to take my car to go do XY and Z. 

With his track record of ruining his cars and FAST, we have already been in several fights about him driving my new car. 

I recently hurt his feeling this morning when I woke up and realized he had taken my car out to drive around town just for the joy of it. 
I called him and we fought about it, about him ruining his cars. I told him ""I just want my car to stay nice for at least a little while! Please!!"" 
Not to mention he doesn't get his car fixed when something breaks so Lord knows I would have to do it. Parts on a 90k car are a lot more expensive than parts on a 40k car.

Question- 

Am I being selfish...? Please don't tear me a new one. I know most people that post about this are men and its vice versa with their wives. 
I feel like I've kind of ""earned"" this from driving the crappy cars our whole relationship and letting him have the newer cars even though he ruins them.

**tl;dr** My husband ruins all his new cars and wants to constantly drive my new car instead of his. Am I being selfish for saying no?"
"UPDATE: Moved out despite concerns for narcissistic mother


My post didn't receive an overwhelming amount of replies but I thought it would be good to do an update. You can find the original post [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/792pfo/i_23f_want_to_move_out_but_am_torn_due_to_leaving/).   


 **TL;DR** Moving out (23f) but can’t decide on what living arrangement would be for the best due to an added complication that my Mom (56f) is dependent on me and I on her. 

&amp;#x200B;

It's been about six months or so since I bought my own place and moved out! However, I won't say it hasn't been tough on the family front. On one hand, every single time I visit home (where my mom is living with my brother + family) I am given guilt trips by my mom regarding not being over enough, not giving my mom time, not sharing details of my life with her, and so on. However, on the other hand, living alone is fantastic. 

Overall, I feel our relationship has become more strained as I don't visit as often and when I message/call her - she doesn't pick up or reply majority of the time. Despite that, she still manages to make me feel terrible for not having enough communication with her and she discounts my attempts at communication (unanswered texts/calls.) In addition, earlier this week she sent me a long rant about how when she knew she was having a girl she was excited at creating a ""best friend"" bond like she has with her mother and that she had ""obviously"" failed at being a mother to me as we don't have anything that resembles that. I just replied telling her I loved her and left it at that. I'm exhausted by her constant need for validation.

On that note, my mom did graduate her program and is now working but seems as miserable as ever. I assume it's partly because I'm not there anymore and my brother doesn't really deal with her emotional mood swings - he barely speaks to her and if he does it for less than 10 minutes. The thing is, I'm getting to that level too, the other day she was so rude to me when I visited that I straight up go out of the car after asking her to pull over and I went home. She later told me that she thinks she's dealing with depression and that is why she lashes out at me - yet she did not apologize for her behaviour and has not made an effort to find a therapist/psychiatrist as she mentioned she would.

On the money front, I have stopped supporting my mom as much as I did before as I don't buy her groceries but when and if we're out and about, I will foot the bill for her things and any food we may buy. This doesn't bother me and she never asks so I feel like in sense, this part of our relationship has gotten a bit better.

Finally, living alone is the bomb.com, seriously. I love it. I was scared I'd feel lonely but so far, I mostly enjoy it. I feel like that may change as the weather turns colder and I go out less (it's already begun) plus the fact that I'm going through a break-up at the moment but I'm hoping to curb my loneliness by becoming a foster dog parent! So we'll see how it goes. Any other loneliness fixes would be appreciated.

&amp;#x200B;

 **TL;DR** Moved out and happier that before, however still dealing with a narcissistic mother who looks to me for validation and uses guilt to get it.

"I (24/M) lost my sister today. My girlfriend (24/F) seems to exspect me to be my usual self.


My sister has been fighting cancer and this morning she passed away with my brother by her side. I'm not a mess (but this is cause of some personality problem's)  but I'm not my happy self.

My girlfriend is a qwerky Chinese girl who likes to be super cute all the time, she's also very clingy, she wants me to be happy and while I can't fault her for that, she keeps asking to do stuff. ""Let's watch this funny movie!"" ""Wanna play Minecraft?"" ""Do you wanna watch something?"".

I can't make decisions for myself right now, I don't feel like I can enjoy anything. And her being around give me this pressure to enjoy myself, she currently lives at my place so I can't tell her to leave me alone or go away. 

How can I get across to her how I feel? 

TL;DR how do I find the words to express myself to my clingy girlfriend that I need space right now."
"My best friend has fallen deep in love with what is most certainly a catfish but he won't listen to me. How to make him snap out of it?


I (35 M) feel like I'm losing my best friend (36 M). About 4 months ago, my best friend from childhood started talking to this girl (34 F) he met on OK Cupid. She sent him pictures, and she's stunning. She tells him: she has only been with one other guy (for 10 years who was abusive), she's a VIRGIN?!, is a vegan just like him, plays the same sports as him, was a nurse practitioner and recently got her license to practicing medicine as an MD, her whole family is apparently doctors, etc...sounds way too good to be true...and most fishy of all won't video chat with him. They were supposed to meet in person a couple months ago (they live about 3 hours away from each other), but she took a trip out of town and all of a sudden her dad had a stroke and mom got cancer (within a month of each other) and so she went across the country to take care of them. She says she doesn't want to video chat because she says she wants the first time they meet to be special - and says that she's old fashioned like that (she's from the Philippines and says that she's very traditional). I told him to at least ask her to take a picture of herself with the date or his name or something as proof and he told me ""her camera broke on her cell phone...""  :X...  He wants to take her for her word until he meets her and sees for himself. He tells me: ""Why go through life doubting everyone, just take their word for it until they prove otherwise."" 

She apparently got a job as a doctor at the same hospital her dad is staying at. I know what you're saying, call the hospital and confirm that there's no doctor by that name working there right? Well, the hospital she used to be at when she was nearby, I called it and asked if someone with her name worked there, and got no name - but she told my friend that since she works for an ""agency"" that places doctors - she's like a traveling doctor that can go from one hospital to the next and that's why they didn't have her name in the registry or something. When he asked her for the name of the agency, she said it's personal... When they had just met 4 months ago, last May, she had just graduated from her medical school and then recently passed her boards, and is now working already?? She said she did her residency previously through 'her agency' while she was working as an NP. It's all very fishy to me, aren't you supposed to do your residency AFTER you pass your tests? Are there any tests you take after your residency? However, I'm not sure about the whole process and I can't find a definitive hole in her story to prove to my friend she's fake. Any doctors out there who have heard anything like this?

They talk on the phone and text 24/7...go to sleep on the phone together....wake up together and continue talking... he's definitely in a committed relationship with SOME FEMALE on the other end, but I have no idea what's going on... it's surreal. They've already planned to move in together, have kids, etc.  I keep trying to tell him to open his eyes, go meet her, etc. but he doesn't want to do it without her permission. He told me he's actually fallen in love with her and I feel like he almost doesn't want to crush the vision and I'm really worried for him. He even told me that if she's been lying, he'd still give her a chance if she explains herself... They tell each other they love each other all the time, they are constantly texting ""I miss you, I love you, etc""....and they haven't even met. It's bizarre. And it's not like he's desperate - he's had many past significant others, has a good head on his shoulders, can find a good girl easily, but somehow has fallen in love with a catfish.

At least she hasn't asked for money or anything. My guess is it's someone who's lonely and just wants to catfish someone for the company? How do I pull my friend away from this? Is there any chance that she's legit? What can or should I do? 

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR; Best friend who's always had a good head on his shoulders is falling deep in love with what I strongly believe is a catfish (stunning girl who claims to be a 34 year old medical doctor AND nurse practitioner, who won't video chat, who's cell phone camera broke, makes excuses to not meet) - and I don't know how to wake him up without hurting him. Help!"
"How do I (24f) politely ask my neighbours (M?F?) to quieten their screams of ecstasy in the middle of the night? (NSFW)


I’ve lived in the same secure apartment building for the last three years with zero problems. I don’t know any of my neighbours very well at all, but we do smile and wave in the hallway on the way to the lift. 

A month ago, a new set of tenants moved in to the apartment next door to me. We literally share a wall. 

Apartment living can be loud, and I am not precious about noise at all, but since this couple moved in, they have woken me up literally every night at 4am with their animalistic love making. 

Their bed frame is right up against our shared wall and the thudding at night is thunderous. The worst part? The screams —yes literal screams  of ecstasy — that are keeping me up at night. 

I wish I was exaggerating about the sound, but it’s so visceral and so loud that I’m almost convinced that my neighbour is fucking a banshee. 

Ear plugs are no match for the screams either and every night I get a little less patient. 

It’s because I find it really hard to get to sleep already and once I am woken up, it’s impossible to fall back asleep again. I’ve been walking around like a zombie all month. I can’t take it anymore.

I’m a very sex positive person and at first I was like “you go girl”, but the sleep deprivation is slowly driving me insane...

The weird thing is, the ‘bump in the night’ isn’t exclusive to the witching hour. These guys are going at it like rabbits throughout the morning, afternoon and evening (I work from home so I hear EVERYTHING). I bumped into another neighbour in the lift (who shares the adjacent wall with the same problematic neighbours) and she’s convinced that an escort service has rented/bought the apartment next to us because she’s never met them either.

The afternoon delights don’t bother me at all because I have my earphones in when I’m working...but it seems there’s never the right time to knock on their door. They’re either fucking or cleaning up (I can hear the shower going).

And even if I was to knock on their door, I don’t want to shame them. Sex is healthy. Sex is great. But their sex life has caused me to chug 4 coffees a day before 10am just to feel normal. 

But I’m at the end of my patience, and I really need a way to delicately bring this up to them. Can I just leave a note? I don’t want things to be awkward. I just want to sleep!

Help.


tldr: my neighbours incredibly loud lovemaking wakes me every night at 4am. How do I delicately ask them to be a little more considerate about the noise?

"BF (M, 30) Cheated on me (F, 29) this Weekend After 7 Years...While I was Visiting his Parents


My boyfriend cheated on me this past weekend with a co worker while I was visiting his parents out of state. 

He also downloaded the app ""Hinge"" and had a profile on there which I found in his email. He has dragged me through hell this past year, and I've stayed by his side every step of the way--last August he was hospitalized for what was the start of a severe alcohol addiction--it ended up 3 hospitalizations and one rehab stint in the past year. Just last week he told me he didn't know how he'd exist without me...I am utterly blindsided by the cheating.

What is your best advice for moving forward? The most difficult feeling I'm having right now, is that my best friend is gone, vanished. The person I've woke up to every morning for 7 years, texted throughout the day, and said goodnight to is essentially dead. And while I don't think there's any saving this, my emotions are all over the place.

**TDLR: How do I get over this?**"
"Me [23m] with my GF [20f] of 2 years. She just broke up with me and when pressed it was because ""I never saw myself with a black guy long term."" I'm devastated. What can I do here?


Obviously i'm black, GF is white. We met in college and I've since graduated and have a really good job. I was with my GF for just over 2 years. 

Over the past few weeks she's been acting strange and finally this weekend she broke up with me. To me it came out of the blue because on labor day I took her on a vacation to Florida and I don't remember the exact words but she told me something like ""I want to do stuff like this with you forever."" 

So she broke up with me Sunday. I did my best to just chill and get over it but I broke down early this morning and called her and asked her what the hell was really going on. She said she didn't want to tell me so I kept pressing her and finally she said ""the truth is I love you so much but I can't see myself with a black guy long term."" This was devastating because I can work on other shit, but I can't change who I am. I still love her so much it fucking hurts and my heart is literally breaking and I've called into work the last two days and missed two huge commissions. This shit is ruining my life. 

What can I do about this? Is there any way to convince her that her thinking is racist and she's wrong and that we can be together?

tl;dr: My GF broke up with me because she said she can't see herself with a black guy long term. What can I do about this?"
"My (m,28) fiancee (f,27) doesn't agree that she needs a job. Together 4 years.


Earlier this summer my fiancee quit her job because she wanted to look for something better. She did it without talking to me first, not that I'd have forbidden her but I'd have said she should have a new job offer lined up first before just quitting. 
Well there's nothing that can be done about that now. It wouldn't be an issue if she was actually landing offers but she isn't. A week or two after leaving her job she started changing her plans. First she'd told me the initial reason, wanting something better. Then she told me she wasn't sure what she wanted to do. She floated a few ideas including taking classes and entering a couple different fields of work she hasn't done before. Now, her line of thought for the past two months has been that she doesn't need to work right now. Doesn't need to, doesn't want to, can't, her phrasing changes a lot. 

She's been going out a lot more with her friends since quitting her job. That means she's spending more money while not bringing any in. Some of her friends also don't have jobs or only pick up temp work here and there, and spend way more time on stuff like partying, drinking, going to concerts and bars than people who work. I'm worried that's where my fiancee is headed. I'm totally cool with her going out doing things with her friends but her having no job means I'm essentially footing that bill once her savings run out.

I've explained this. I've asked her to please look for a job, any job (she stopped applying anywhere a while back) even if it's temporary while she figures out what she really wants to do. She still needs money in the meantime, costs of basic living don't stop. I can support myself including both regular expenses plus fun things fine, but I wouldn't be able to support those for the both of us on my salary. 

None of this has made an impact. I say directly that not going back to work isn't a possible option. She always has a bunch of reasons why she can't. The reasons make no sense at all but there's a neverending list of them, if I shoot down one she's got another ready. They're all absurd to be honest.

What do I do now? Adults can't just be unemployed by choice! Unless I guess you've got someone else's money supporting you but that's not the situation here.

Tl;dr: At an impasse with fiancee over the fact that she needs to have a job. She won't make any effort to get one, and none of her reasons why she can't work make any sense."
"I'm [18F] a bit creeped out by a guy in my dorm[18M] and not sure how to handle him.


I just recently started college. I was super nervous but excited about moving into the dorms and leaving home. My parents and brother came to help me move in and see me off. The dorm building looks amazing! It's one of the newer ones near the campus so it's a modern building and all the decor is fresh. It's really beautiful.

Moving in went fine, few tears but it was okay. I was super excited to start a new chapter in my life. The rooms are single rooms, each has an en suite shower and toilet in it too so no having to share facilities. The kitchen is shared as is a common room area with a TV and sofas. It's shared between 8 people and we found out it was 5 girls and 3 guys sharing those areas. I met everyone while moving in and everyone seemed friendly and just as nervous as me. There was one of the guys though who was very interested in me and another girl (both Asian) and began trying to impress us with the 5 words of Japanese he knows and all the anime/video game knowledge he has. I'm from the Bay Area and I'm not really all that knowledgeable about my heritage and what's going on in Japan. Even my family in Japan we don't really have any geeks for me to learn this stuff.

I brushed that off as it's not really the first time it happened, my family moved when I was in high school and I went to somewhere that didn't have many Asian students so some guys were interested in me based on my looks. So the other girl I'll call her Trish for this and we'll call the guy Chris the creep or just 'Chris' for short. I found out Trish has a boyfriend from high school and he comes to visit her and hangout since he goes to school not very far away. Chris also found this out as Trish told me he'd been talking to her in the common room and when her boyfriend visited he seemed to lose a lot of interest in her.

The other two guys I didn't talk to much but they seem nice. They told everyone in the dorm about a party on another floor that they were inviting people in the dorm to. I talked to some of the other girls and Trish and everyone gets along which is something I was worried about before coming to college and hearing roommate horror stories. But on to my horror story....Chris also came to that party and pretty much followed me around all night. We spoke a little but he mostly just seemed to be walking around anywhere I was and watching me. After I left he walked with me and another girl back to the dorm. She wasn't feeling well and I'd had enough so I said I'd walk back with her and he invited himself to help too. He pretty much ignored her and started asking me questions about boyfriends and if my parents will only let me date Asian boys. (what the fuck!?)

Anyway since the first week of moving in anytime I'm in the kitchen or common areas he's there. The only time I get a break is when he has classes but I don't think he goes to all of them and he's talking about changing one of them to one of my classes. I made some other friends and I've been eating with them a lot recently, he's even showing up in those areas we eat. You could argue it's coincidence because it's a popular spot for students to go but it feels like he's been spying on me.

My room has a lock at least so he can't come in here, not that he hasn't tried. One time I went to the kitchen to get some snacks I had in the fridge that I could heat up and eat while doing some work. He was in the kitchen doing his work and he starts talking to me. I wait for my food to cook and just kinda talk to him a bit. Then he vanishes from the kitchen by the time I turn around and I go back to my room. He's standing in there just looking around and complimenting my room. I got really angry and told him to leave and he just kinda laughs and leaves. One of the guys who also lives in the dorm saw it and asked if I'm okay. I just said it's fine and locked my door.

The most recent thing is I started finding poems slid under my door. It's obvious who it is and after I told Trish she and some other girls asked him and he denied it. After that happened I've had a new poem each day and they get progressively worse. He's also recently been telling people that he told his parents about me and his dad said we'd make a nice couple and they said he has pictures of me on his phone I don't know about. This person has no socialization skills and no concept of boundaries. Yesterday I had coffee with a guy from my classes as we were discussing some things we needed to read and where to get the books cheap. I guess Chris saw us as he was asking me who the guy was and I told him it's none of his business. This seemed to make him mad as he left the common room and went to his room. I was told later he came out and was pacing in the hallway near my room. I'm supposed to meet the same guy again soon as he invited me out and he was nice enough to help me so I said I'd buy him lunch today.

I feel uncomfortable that Chris will be watching me again and I don't feel comfortable when he's around me in the dorm. I wonder if he'll eventually get the message and go away or if this will continue and if he does keep following me around the dorm and asking me awkward questions, posting stuff under my door and so on what I should do about it.

He's technically not violated any rules by being where I am and it's also his kitchen and common area so I can't make him leave or tell him when he can be there. I don't think he should get away with this though.

tl;dr: Boy who has a thing for Asian girls in my dorm keeps hanging around in the kitchen and common room when me and another Asian girl are there. He started leaving her alone when he found out she has a boyfriend and focused on me. Is getting creepier posting poems under my door and denying it, asking questions about people I become friends with and randomly walking in my room when the door is unlocked. Not sure how to handle his creepyness since technically he has a right to hang out in the dorm when I'm there even if he bothers me by staring at me and only comes out his room when I'm around. "
"I [27/f] love my BF [36/m] of 4 years, but he won't come to my sister's wedding, and I need to work up the courage to end our relationship


**BACKGROUND**

My (36/m) BF is a wonderful, remarkable person - never married, no kids, no real serious relationships before me. I love him with everything I am, and I would do anything to spend my life with him, but I think I've just reached my limit and I need advice on how to leave someone you love. 

I met N four years ago and we've had this insane chemistry since the first time we spoke. He is a wonderful friend to his friends, a wonderful son to his parents, uncle to his niece, brother to his sister, but he is admittedly limited in his ability to be a functional romantic partner. 

N has a severe dismissive-avoidant attachment style (diagnosed) which was exacerbated by an extremely serious injury at age 27 that resulted in the loss of a limb. I truly, truly believe that he loves me (although he has never been able to outright say it) and he tries to show me in the only ways he knows how - gifts, concerts, introducing me friends and family at events and holidays, and showing me how he feels physically. He is seeing someone about this and he is really trying to communicate better with me, and be present, and be supportive. After years of dating, he agreed to meet my sister when she was in town last - the only family member of mine he's ever agreed to meet. It's not that he doesn't want to meet them but a fear of commitment on his end. I've met his whole family, by the way. I was excited that he was able to take this step, and we celebrated it, but I'm starting to get exhausted. After 4 years, it shouldn't feel like pulling teeth to get him to participate. 

However, I have always known that I cannot count on him to be there for me when I am upset. He wants to be, and tells me that I should tell him when I need him, but it always makes him skittish and squirrelly to deal with my emotions, so I try to limit his exposure to them, relying heavily on platonic friends and family to play that role in his stead. We do not live together because it gives him anxiety to share his space - and he needs a lot of space.  We will have an intimate encounter and it will make him back off, and downplay it or pull away for weeks at a time. 

I have been extremely patient and met many of my emotional support needs elsewhere, because I wanted so badly to believe he was worth it. I have pushed my needs back and down inside me to be compassionate and understanding about his fear of commitment. 

**SITUATION** 

My sister is getting married next month, and I want  him to be my date. I told him I would be understanding if he told me he couldn't work up the nerve to come. I told him a year ahead of time so that he could have time to process the request.  This is the only thing I have ever asked him to do for me in four years, and he recognized that it was important to me and said he would try. 

But he's not coming. I know I told him before it would be okay, but I'm honestly just exhausted. I'm extremely upset that he's not coming, but I don't want to make him feel bad about it. 

I'm just realizing that I'm tired of him not being able to show up. It's not that he doesn't want to, it's that he can't. I'm tired of not being able to count on him, and I need to end it, but I love him and I don't know how to follow through. 

I want desperately for him to change, to be able to support me, but he can't. I feel like it's petty to end a four year relationship over not wanting to come to a wedding. I feel like I will regret it. I don't know how to break up with him when I don't really *want* to, I just cognitively know I need to. 

**ADVICE**

How do I break up with a person that I love, but who can't meet my needs because of his own limitations. How do I make it stick? 

**TL;DR: My BF is dismissive-avoidant, unreliable, and I realized I should want more for myself when he couldn't work up the courage to come to my sister's wedding. How do you break up with someone you love?**"
"I [27/F] haven’t had sex with husband [29/M] in 8 months after his accident. Starting to go crazy (not really NSFW)


Details changed because I don’t want any family on reddit reading this. Throwaway account. 

My husband and I met through friends and had a storybook romance. We met and just couldn’t stay away from each other. We got along on so many levels, I always felt like I could tell him anything without judgement. He got me and I got him. We got married three years ago and I love him as much now as I did before. But now I respect him more. But I’m also ticked off with him and tired of some of his BS. I need help getting through to him and would appreciate people’s advice. 

8 months ago my husband lost his left leg in an accident. It was a tragic, freak accident that upended everything. I couldn’t believe it when it happened. The surgeon came into the room and told me he was going to survive but that the damage to his leg was extensive and it probably couldn’t be saved. I remember telling him to just save my husband. Hours later I saw him for the first time hooked up to machines and missing his leg. I was so happy he was going to be okay. After finding out he was low, but he worked hard to compensate. He was up the next day. He was trying out a prosthetic limb two weeks later. He worked hard to get mobile. He put on a lot of weight – 40+ lbs. But, he was walking sooner than I imagined and relatively quickly he was back to work. After the injury he was so grateful for my help. He even became emotional thanking me. I know he still loves me, he just doesn't show it anymore. 

Outside of home, he’s this kickass, take no prisoners kind of guy. He’s back to exercising, people are struck by how quickly he bounced back in the hospital. He lost the weight he gained, built up his core strength and arm strength and even discontinued physical therapy. He has a very slight limp that improves with practice. He even ran (as much as he hates it) and never once lost his balance. Yet, at home? He wears pants 24 hours a day. He changes from his pants into pajama pants and goes to absolutely great lengths not to let me see his prosthetic leg. He mostly sleeps on the couch and when I can coax him into bed, it’s on the far side of the bed so I’m next to his right leg, not left (despite the fact that I HATE that side of the bed). He gets changed behind locked doors and if he’s in the bath or changing he won’t answer me if I call him – he doesn’t want me knowing what he’s doing. 

We used to have a very open relationship – we could change in front of each other. We could talk when the other person was bathing. We had a lot of fun, passionate sex. We could lay in bed and enjoy each other’s company. He’s become a monk. I haven’t seen his chest since he was in the hospital. He doesn’t touch me, he isn’t affectionate. He keeps giving me the option to leave him. I don’t want to leave him, I just want to try and work our way back to a place where we’re both happy. If I recommend therapy he recoils in horror. 

I feel so isolated because people see “outside husband” who is in control and absolutely ready to take on the world. I see “inside husband” and I feel like I don’t have anyone to talk to. I want things to change, I don’t know how to make this happen. When I talk with him about this, he reminds me of his offer for a pain free divorce, tells me he loves me but that he doesn't want to make me stay. He says he can't stand what the injury has done to him and I should be grossed out. 

Please, I need everyone’s help. 

tl;dr husband lost left leg and hides it from me. We haven't had any affection in 8 months. He's ""grossed out"" by his injury but puts on a facade for everyone else. He's had a great recovery and all I want is some affection and physical intimacy.

"My boyfriend [27 M] doesn't take my programming [23 F] job seriously, because I get to work remotely, and prefer to work outdoors.



I'm a software developer and I'm able to work from home two days a week. I like getting out of the house though, so I tend to work outdoors like in the park, or at coffeeshops, restaurants, libraries, etc. I've got a beast of a laptop with great battery life, so if I charge it overnight, it'll easily last for the workday. I've also got unlimited data on my phone, and a mobile hotspot app, so I can get wifi anywhere.

It's nice getting to work somewhere prettier than a cubicle for a few days a week, I really like laying around in the park or putting down a picnic blanket in the woods on nice days, or going to this beautiful library near my apartment. My boss and coworkers don't care, as long as I get stuff done. I actually tend to get more done, somewhere peaceful and outdoorsy, rather than in the office. Especially if I'm doing something that needs a lot of focus and thought.

My boyfriend seems to think that means I don't take my job seriously, or that I don't have a hard job and I'm just spending a few days a week hanging out outside or in coffeeshops. Even though I tell him that I can write code and handle emails and calls anywhere, and just because I'm outside doesn't mean I'm not working.

Last Friday, I decided to go to this island on a river near me, to work. It's a little wooded island with a pedestrian / bike bridge to it. It's usually pretty empty during the workday, especially when school is in session.

My boyfriend called me that morning, apparently his office had a plumbing issue and he had the day off unexpectedly. He wanted to come hang out on the island. I said no, I was working but we could hang out after 5 pm, because I know he always wants to chat when we hang out. He made some passive aggressive comment about me ""sunning myself on some island"" and I said that I wasn't there to tan, I was actually getting a lot done, and I had to go and get back to work. When I got done with work, we went out for food and drinks, and he asked me how my tan was coming along. I got annoyed, saying he was being ridiculous, I told him I wasn't out tanning. I wasn't even sitting in the sun, I was in the shade so I could see my screen better.

I feel like he doesn't take my job seriously, just because I get to work remotely twice a week. He always wants to hang out when he has the chance, and gets passive aggressive when I say that I really am working.

TLDR - My boyfriend has been dismissive of my job and how hard I work, because of the fact that I work outdoors when I get the chance.

"My dads (55M) wife (55f) is wearing my (25f) dead mothers clothing


*Throwaway account. Bit of a long story but TL;DR at the bottom! I'll try to be as succinct as possible but this spans over 4 years.*

I had a bit of a messed up year a few years ago. My mum (who I was extremely close to) was diagnosed and died from cancer within months. My dad and I had never been close (he's a bit odd, a bit abusive), but I admired how he looked after my mum during that time. 

Cut to her death. Im still living at home. Dad and her were married for 3 decades. 

Day after her death, he removes all the pictures of my mum and my sister and I from around the house. Moves all the clothing from their room and throws it into the spare room. I tell him its too quick for me, but he doesn't listen. 

I catch him chatting to people on the phone a few times, I ask him questions and he is evasive. Turns out he is talking to ladies from a dating website. The night of my mums funeral he has a date with a woman. I'll call her Carol. 

I find out and am, not surprisingly, pretty upset. I say its disrespectful to my mum who did EVERYTHING for him and was an amazing wife and mother. He says its got nothing to do with me and he can do what he wants. I no longer feel welcome in my home and I start to move out. My dad catches me and asks me to stay. I give him one last chance.

Turns out, Carol is coming over that night. I tell him I will not have any part of it, but request that he AT LEAST doesn't have her stay the night.. in my mum and his bed. He agrees.

Next morning, guess whose car is still in the driveway? 

I confront my father about it. He yells at me and tells me if I can't deal with it, get out. So I do. 

He is not happy about this. He changes the locks to the family home, dumps all of my belongings in the vacant unit attached to the house, and sends me abusive text messages daily.

I move into temporary accomodation with family. I get berated every day I am gone, I am told my mother would be ashamed of me (for more than just moving out, but thats a story for another time.) He does awful things like creating a fake facebook account to message people on my business account and tell them what a horrible person I am. 

He asks me to come over one day and tells me he is marrying Carol (3 months after my mums death). She has also moved in. I get extremely depressed and anxious. I'm dealing with the loss of both parents at this stage and the emotional turmoil really takes a toll on me. 

I see a therapist, I have also met a wonderful human and we move out together. After several months I consider a restraining order from my dad. I never file one because the abusive messages and calls finally end. Regardless, I cut off all contact, block him from everything and move on with my life with my new partner.

But I have a lot of hatred in my heart. I go 18 months without talking to him before I finally open up communication again. I miss having a parent. When I contact him he is civil, he is trying. He asks me to come to his birthday and I agree. It was a horrible night and I struggle with everything - Carol in my mums house, the fact the pictures are still all gone, the way she has changed everything in the house..  

It takes me a long time but I finally let go of my hatred and I now have a civil relationship with both of them. I don't expect much from them. Carol is a nice enough person, which is odd to say but she is.. I mention my mum a lot and she never stops me. She makes me food and always invites me over. She doesn't know how I truly feel about the situation but I try to keep the peace. My dad isn't abusive or mean to me anymore. We have been civil for a while. He says he is proud of me. 

Only once has the whole ordeal was brought up and he made it incredibly obvious that he doesn't think he did anything wrong. I told him I can't have this conversation and left for my sanity. He doesn't get it and I think I need to accept that. He thinks differently to normal humans. 

Cut to today. My sister mentions that Carol has been wearing my mothers clothing and it feels like a stab in the gut - like I'm back in those horrible years again. I text Carol and ask. She says she has been occasionally, why do I ask? 

I haven't responded. My partner says to let it go but I guess I just see it as another slight against my mother. Practically, my dad and Carol think that it's not a big deal - it's just clothing - and it would go to the op shop anyway. 

I see it as my MUMS clothing. I struggle to separate the two and see more as a symbol of her. To be frank, I think it's pretty friggin messed up and it brings back all these feelings from early on. 

So the question is - do I just let this go? If not, what do I say? 

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR: Mum died, dad remarried extremely quickly, woman now wearing my mothers clothing. Do I bother making a fuss? "
"[22 f] I'm not allowed to meet my bf's [25 m] new best friend. Should I be worried?


I've been dating Sean for about 6 months now, things have been going mostly great (couple ups and downs) but Ive been happy so far.

A few months ago Sean made a new female coworker friend, Dana. They both work in a restaurant, and quickly became very close work friends. Sean has a naturally very flirty charisma, so I assumed there was probably some innocent flirting happening between the two. Sean talks about her quite a bit, but he talks about work in general a lot so I didnt think much of it, until how he kept describing her, its obvious shes got a massive crush on him.

They go out drinking alone occasionally after work, and Ive expressed my general discomfort with how behaves around her outside of work (e.g. getting drunk alone at bars, talking on the phone late at night, pretending to be her boyfriend so men dont hit on her) and he blows it off that I'm just jealous, and nothing is going on. I think my concern isn't so much that he's going to do something, but that he's leading her on. Also he's met a few of Dana's friends and how he words it, it seems like she's trying to set him up with other women.

Recently though Ive been trying really hard to have him let me meet her to see if meeting her will help me feel less uncomfortable with her. He always shuts down that conversation by saying things like we wont click, or that my pre-conceived concern over her will make me just hate her and be mean to her.

Should I be worried with this defensive, and refusing behavior? If not, how can I help him see why it looks REALLY bad in my eyes that I'm not allowed to meet her, or convince him to let us meet?

Tldr: my bf made a new female work friend and Im not allowed to meet her. Im worried something else might be going on and not being allowed to meet her is only fueling my worry. How can I convince him to let me meet her?"
"I'm [22f] going bike-camping with a group from work [early 20s]. A guy [44m] wants to come, and bring his son [7m]. He's mad I said adults only.



I've been working at a tech company for about a year. It's my first full time job. I've made a couple good friends at work, with a few of the younger people at the office. We're all into outdoors activities. We've gone bike-camping over a weekend before, loading up bicycles with tents and food, we've gone skydiving, and horseback riding. We've rented a beach house for a weekend once. On a bunch of these trips, we've extended the invitation to new employees or other people at work we didn't know as well.

It's always a small group of people in their 20s, who are athletic enough to do this stuff, and mostly single. It's not like we go on these trips to date or hook up though. Me and the other girl Melissa who goes often, are both gay (and not interested in each other). And all the guys are straight, afaik. So it's more like we go out for bro/brah time. Enjoying the outdoors, drinking a lot and talking shit, etc.
 
Melissa, Jon, and me do most of the organizing of trips, Melissa and Jon are both really outgoing and good at organising stuff with people, and I'm good at the logistics side of planning stuff. 

----

Right now, we're trying to do another bike camping trip before it gets cold. It's coming up this weekend, Saturday through Monday because the whole office has Monday off. We've already figured out tent arrangements, split the food and booze costs, figured out who's carrying what gear, etc.

Just yesterday, my coworker Arthur told me that Jon had extended an invitation to him, and he'd want to come. I said that it was kinda last minute but I'd talk to the group to try and figure something out. He said that his son was really excited for it, and it would really disappoint him if they couldn't come. I asked how old the kid was, apparently he is 7. 

I texted the group, saying Arthur wanted to come and bring a 7 year old. Everyone pretty much agreed this was not that kind of trip, we'd be biking decently far every day, we'd be getting drunk in the woods at night, and then doing the same thing again. A couple people mentioned stuff about how weird it was that Arthur thought this would be a good trip for a kid.

I told Arthur that we were gonna keep the trip 21+ because we were gonna spend our time in camp partying. He said that he brings his son to social events all the time, and it's ok. I said that it was also an issue because we were going a good distance every day, and we were worried we'd have to stop if his son got tired. He said his son would be fine, but I've worked with kids a lot (I spent 4 summers as an overnight camp counselor) and I don't see that as likely. Even an athletic kid is gonna get fed up and whine about it eventually. So I told Arthur sorry, but this trip is still 21+.

Arthur keeps trying to guilt me today, saying that he was invited, his son was so excited to go, and I was being rude by dis-inviting him. However, I know that when Jon invited him, he didn't know about the kid. Jon's told me himself that he doesn't want a kid hanging around.

I'm kinda in an awkward position here. The group going absolutely doesn't want to go with a kid there, but since I'm the one telling Arthur this, he's upset with me. Feels like he's killing the messenger, really.

How do I handle this politely? These are all colleuges, so I can't he as blunt as I would be with another acquaintance.

TLDR - My friends from work and I are going bike-camping for 3 days. One of my friends invited Arthur, and Arthur wants to come with his son. Nobody wants a kid there, and I had to tell that to Arthur, who's now mad at me."
"I [24F] gave my boyfriend [29M] of two years an ultimatum. I think it was the right thing to do, but I'm a little afraid of the fallout.


I posted about this before, but the TL;DR is that my boyfriend's brother moved into his condo in December and the two of them have hardly made any progress in getting him to move. My boyfriend and I have been planning on me moving in whenever his brother moves out and I'm losing my patience, so I gave an ultimatum that I will leave if he's not gone in three months.

My boyfriend and I have been together for two years.

The brother has a date to move out by, November 30, but no progress is being made. He's not searching for places, he's not saving money, he gets irritated any time my boyfriend brings it up. To make matters worse, my boyfriend's parents are mad at him for ""kicking his brother out""... which is clearly ridiculous considering he got four months of notice and he's a 29 year old man (they're twins) with a full time job. The parents are honestly two of the most frustrating people I've ever met, but those are stories for another time. Long story short, they're very overbearing and petty, my boyfriend basically walks on eggshells around them.

After more than a month of no progress, I decided it was time to give the ultimatum. I told my boyfriend if his brother is not out by Nov. 30, I will be gone. We have a vacation planned for December, but he will not be going if his brother is still in his home. This was suggested in the comments of my last post, and I think it's reasonable. It's already said and done, so please don't tell me you think it was wrong. I just don't want to continue to wait around and get walked all over while these two do nothing about it. If my boyfriend wants to make me a priority that would be great, if not, he's not worth it anymore, unfortunately.

My boyfriend didn't take it very well. He cried. He said he didn't want to have to pick between me and his family. He has been telling me his brother will absolutely be out by Nov. 30, but now he's saying he's scared, so that worries me that he's just been telling me what I want to hear. And I'm not asking him to choose between me and his family. I'm asking him to make me a priority. Everyone I have consulted (from people on Reddit, to friends, family, and coworkers) all think it's ridiculous he can't seem to get his brother to move out after nine months. That stands to reason his parents are really just being being overbearing and if they will truly be upset about this, I think my boyfriend needs to reassess his relationship with them. Like I said, they're very overbearing and I don't think they have a healthy relationship.

Though I do think this was the right thing to do and I think it's important to have a backbone, I'm now facing the possibility of problems with his family. If my boyfriend brings this up with his family, they'll think I'm being spiteful and trying to tear them apart. I want to have a good relationship with them for the potential long term, but at what cost? I'm more worried it'll cause a rift between him and his family... but again, I just feel like this whole thing is insane and there's no way everyone can be happy.

This is all a mess. If anyone has any advice on how to proceed, I would really appreciate it. Thank you.

TL;DR - boyfriend's brother won't move out after almost one year, I gave my boyfriend and ultimatum that I will leave if he's not out on Nov. 30"
"My (28f) husband (30m) of 5 years berated and yelled at me in the middle of NYC because I wanted to eat a chain restaurant and then took off. I feel so humiliated and don't know what to do.


So some quick background, husband and I normally have a great relationship. I am 3 months pregnant but we had a long planned trip because I have never seen New York. Even though I'm not feeling super great, we decided we'd go anyways.

I'm not sure if it's the approaching hurricane, or if was just a bad flight but our flight yesterday was MISERABLE. It was 3 hours late, I was sick the entire time, they split us up, he had to sit next to a screaming baby and a kid kicked his seat. They still don't know where our luggage is and our uber from the airport was stuck in traffic. All in all it was a miserable travel day. To top it all off my husband had worked until midnight finishing up loose ends before we left so he had maybe 3 hours of sleep. 

Luckily our Airbnb is perfect and we settled in. But I was starving and just wanted to grab something to eat. I have a massive craving for Hooters chicken strips so I saw that there was one right down the street. So we started walking there and he kept looking up more ""local"" restaurants on his phone. I told him I was happy to try other places in the 5 days that we were going to be here but right now I just wanted to get into a place, order what I knew I liked and eat. 

He absolutely freaked out and started yelling in the middle of the sidewalk. He said things like ""he was on this fucking trip for you and you won't even accommodate what I want to fucking do!"" and accused me of being selfish and called me a spoiled b---- who always gets my way. I tried to calmly tell him that I just wanted to eat and I didn't even mind going to another restaurant later, but now I was starving. Then he started ranting that I was an entitled ""c---"" who just thinks his money grows on trees and I don't work hard enough (I do, I just don't make as much as he does) to demand ""two fucking meals."" 

He stormed of and basically left me by myself. I had no idea what to do so I just went to McDonalds and took it back to the Airbnb and ate. 

Maybe an hour later he texted me ""I'm really sorry I blew up so bad at you. You didn't deserve that.""

I texted back ""where are you?""

His text: ""I found out Anthony (his friend from college) lives in Brooklyn. I'm going to stay there tonight because I scared myself today and I feel awful.""

Me: ""I'd rather you just come be with me""

Him: ""I just need some space""

Me: ""OK""


And that's the last I heard from him. It's now almost 10AM and I haven't heard from him. I want to give him space but I also feel like he needs to make this up to me. I was so humiliated when he was yelling at me. He's never done anything like that before (like ever) and I know he was frustrated and tired but I feel like him taking off wasn't the right answer either. 

I would love ANY advice on how to handle this situation? 

Part of me feels I should just change my ticket and go home and let him figure out whatever space he needs on his own. Part of me thinks that I can let this gloss over and we can have our trip. Right  now I'm by myself in a huge city I've never been to before and don't know what to do. 


tl;dr: my husband freaked out on me when I wanted to eat at a chain restaurant in New York City. He left to stay with a friend and I haven't heard from him. I don't know what to do. "
"My[43F] Irresponsible Son[24M] Recently Moved In After Being Kicked Out Of His Own House, Now He's Tried To Move His Homeless Friends Into My House Too, Without My Permission.


Hello, Redditors. I'm currently experiencing a quite odd predicament, one I'm not too sure how to go about. My 25 year old son recently got kicked out of his own home for failing to uphold payments on rent and bills, of course, he came running back to me to provide for him. I let him stay until he could get back up on his feat, find a job, and get a new place. However, in the 3 months he's stayed here, he hasn't tried to do anything anymore then walking to his drug dealers house and flicking a few controller buttons. Seriously, the boy doesn't do anything besides Marijuana (something that was specifically banned in my house, but he's brought back into it, despite my anger) and play Fortnite, he also has a tendency to have tantrums over very small things, which has been hard enough (and before y'all say it, this has developed in his recent years, not anytime I've been raising him) Recently, he's also been having a couple of his friends over for extensive periods of time as well. Just this morning, after telling him they can't be here all throughout the day and night, he told me they were homeless and had nowhere else to go.


Right now, I'm annoyed enough as it is, but I just don't know how to handle the situation. My first thought would be, ""They're not my problem, why do I need to house them?!"" But I also don't want to be responsible for them being out on the street when they're really just stupid kids(same age as him, 24). I'm also obviously mad at my son. I really don't know what to do with him either...but I've been feeling like I've given him way too many chances with his behaviour and irresponsibility.


**Tl;dr- My[43F] son[24M] recently moved in after getting kicked out of his own house for not paying rent, I let him stay with me until he gets his shit together. He has neglected to do so at all in the past 3 months, instead just playing video games all night long, smoking marijuana, and having constant tantrums about anything, and only recently brought his homeless friends into my house without consulting me. I've been feeling the need to get all 3 of them out of my house for obvious reasons, but I also don't want to be the reason they're all homeless. I need some other people's opinions on it before I say anything more to them about this all. Anything ranging from what y'all think I should say/do, to extremes is fine.**"
"My sons[26M] new gf[24F] has a very bad social anxiety and is extremely shy which hinders her relationship with my wife[46F] and I[47M] - how can we help ourselves in interacting with her in the best possible way and form a relationship with her?


So I am not really sure if this is the right sub for this but I figured I'd give it a shot.

My son has been dating Eva for over a year now. I've met Eva a few times since my son has brought her home for dinner and by all accounts, she seems like a great girl from what my son has told me about her. He is like really, really in love with her. You can just sense it by the way he talks about her. He told me and his mom a few times that this is a girl he can see himself getting married to. 

He is very happy with her and we are happy for him by definition. But the one thing that is interesting about Eva is that she is very introverted. She also has social anxiety and is extremely shy. To the point where she will remain quiet for the entire evening only conversating with my son and will give only short answers to general questions about herself. Answers, that came off rather defensive. 


That happened on the first time my son brought her over to introduce her to us at dinner. There were two other times where I thought that we would make progress but it really didn't happen. If anything, Eva was even quieter the next time around. You could visibly see how uncomfortable she was surrounded by people. And it's not like we were that many people to begin with.

The first time was just me, my wife, our three children and Eva. The second time was me, my son, my youngest daughter and my BIL who came to visit my wife. And the third time was just my wife and I plus my son and Eva. 


We've talked to my son about Eva and he said that it will take time for her to get used to us and to know us better. I mean, she has her friends that she is hanging out with but she knows these people from a very young age and is comfortable around them. 

Like I've said, my son, even though being the polar opposite of her (he is a very social, very active and extroverted person), is really happy with her. And my wife and I really want to get to know Eva better since we can see how much she means to our son. The problem here is that much like my wife, I am not really used to interacting with people like Eva.

I mean, I don't know what to do and say in certain situations in order to not scare Eva away. The last time we tried talking to her was the morning after the third time my son and Eva were at home. In the morning, my wife and I were in the kitchen making breakfast when Eva came. I asked her if she had a good sleep last night and my wife followed with asking her if she wants breakfast. 

I swear Eva looked like a cornered animal. She again gave a very short ""No, I am fine"" and went upstairs. She didn't come downstairs for the rest of the day. Not that she has to give long and elaborated answers but I feel like we can do better. 

What pushed me to write this is that my son called a few days ago saying that Eva got a very good job offer here in our hometown and that she wants to accept it. So they will be moving back to his hometown and that they are looking for a new place to live. This prompted me to offer them our home. 

Our house is rather big, three stories(excluding the basement and the attic) and there is an entire unoccupied floor available. My wife and I live on the 2nd floor, the 1st floor was available as well but we moved my MIL there after the death of my FIL a few months ago, that has been quite difficult for both my MIL and my wife. So the 3rd floor is all theirs. 

My son said that he'd talk with Eva and he will come back to us. We figured that maybe they won't accept but we were, pleasantly surprised to hear that Eva agreed. So we are expecting them sometimes around 2 weeks from now. My wife and I are really happy that our son is going to be around much more now. Out of all three of my children, he is the one that least often comes home and we rather miss him. 


We don't have any concerns about how we'd make it work. My wife and I won't bother our son and Eva that much. They will have their privacy and we will respect that. Our only concern is how we'd interact with Eva mostly. Again, we are not very used to interacting with her or people like her but we want to have a relationship with her and make her feel at home so she can have a positive experience while living with us.

I guess my question here is if you're put in Eva's position how you'd like to be approached? How would it be easier for you to connect with people if interacting with people makes you anxious? What can I do here to make her stay as smooth as possible? I want to get to know Eva better without causing this poor girl any distress. I am sorry if this is a weird question but I am just looking for some tips on how to improve my wife and I's relationship with Eva. I feel like her agreeing to come and stay with us is the first step in doing this and she made it. And now it's our turn. So, guys, can you help a guy out?


tl;dr My son has been dating a girl for about a year now. He is by all accounts extremely happy and is really in love with her. The issue is that his gf is a very introverted, shy and has a very bad social anxiety and communicating with her is difficult since we are still strangers to her and she is not comfortable around us. They are going to come and live with us for the time being and I am looking for any tips on how to form a relationship with Eva and improve it.

"My (36f) former best friend (27f) (7 years) will not stop interfering in my life. Tonight she ruined a family dinner. Should I escalate to legal action?


My former best friend, ""Beth"", and I had a falling out a year and a half ago. Long story short, Beth said some pretty awful things about my sister-in-law even though Beth is guilty of doing essentially the same things. Because of her behavior, I chose to distance myself from Beth. She never apologized and after a year finally asked what the deal was. I told her that I didn't appreciate what was said and that it was too late to apologize. I told her I had no ill will towards her and wished her well, but I have no desire to remain friends.

In the last year and a half, Beth has made plans with my family members in order to be around me. She will take selfies and send them to me when I don't show up to these events. She makes Facebook posts about these events and tags my family members in them. 

I told everyone what Beth said about my sister-in-law within a day or two after it was said. Every single one of them said they couldn't believe Beth would say such a thing, but I had a witness there when Beth said out that backed me up. My brother believed me and cut contact with Beth, as did my sister-in-law. My mother tried to ""make us friends again"", but can't seem to understand Beth said these things about her own daughter-in-law.

Earlier tonight (Well, last night since it's nearly 4 a.m.), Beth showed up at my sister-in-law's birthday party that she found out about from my mother's Facebook. My mother posted a picture of my sister-in-law arriving at the restaurant and being surprised. Beth then showed up about 15 minutes later.

Beth sat down between my husband and I and was hugging me and saying how much she appreciated ""the invite"" and how she was sorry she was ""too late for the surprise"". My sister-in-law and brother shot me a look of ""WTF!"" while my mother said, ""I'm so glad you've worked things out.""

I got so upset that I replied to my mother, ""*We* worked out nothing.""

I then told Beth that she needed to leave as I haven't spoken to her in nearly 4 months and I never sent her an invite. She got upset and said she didn't know what was wrong. I ended up telling her to ""get the Hell away from me"" and she refused to leave. My mother then got into me, telling me I was being extremely rude, and then said there was no reason Beth couldn't join us. My mother then said to my sister-in-law, ""You don't mind, do you sister-in-law"", to which my sister-in-law didn't say anything. My brother responded by saying, ""Fuck that, you can both leave"" in regards to our mother and Beth.

At this point my husband and I ended up leaving. I contacted my mother-in-law (she works in a legal environment) and asked her if she felt this would be considered grounds for harassment. She said she wasn't sure, but is getting me an appointment with a lawyer at the firm she works with.

Am I blowing this out of proportion? What more can I do to prevent Beth from interfering in my life?

#TL;DR: Former best friend, Beth, and I had falling out 1.5 yrs ago over things she said about my sister-in-law (that Beth essentially also does). I've cut contact but Beth remains in contact with some family members and is always trying to hang out with me through family events. She crashed my sister-in-law's birthday party, claiming I invited her (I did not), and things escalated. Should I seek legal action to keep her away (If possible)? What else can I do to prevent her from interfering in my life? Or am I blowing this out of proportion?"
"My wife (26F) of 3 years just told me (27M) that she wants to go the medical school... this has never been brought up before


I'm on mobile, so sorry for any mistakes.

My wife and I have had what I thought was a happy marriage. She's a stay at home wife, which is completely fine (I make a fairly average salary, but we don't live in a high cost of living area and we're  not big spenders). But out of the blue, she told me she wants to go to med school.

I'm shocked. She's never brought this up before. She got average grades at a state college (which is completely fine with me!) and then worked as a receptionist for two years until we got married, saying she wants to be a homemaker.

I'm just... stunned. I asked her where she would get the money and she said I would pay or she would get a loan. We can barely afford the applications: each costs $75-$100 and she says she needs to apply to at least 20 schools!

I don't know what to do. She has never brought up wanting to be a doctor at all. She said she hated working and loves being at home! I asked her if something happened in her personal life and she said no and that she just found her true calling.

So what do I do? I don't want to be controlling. I'm perfectly happy if my wife wants to get a job. But med school feels like too much, and we've never talked about this (I would've at least started saving money if we had). I am just very lost.

Tl;dr: My stay at home wife has decided she wants to go to med school even though she's never mentioned it before."
"My (26f) bf (30m) of 6.5 years started therapy and now is contemplating whether to leave me or not


My bf has always been battling with depression and for a long time he was a able to do it himself. 
However past few years it became worse and I’ve suggested him to visit a psychiatrist who’s helped me a lot. He agreed and has been in therapy for 1 year.

Yesterday he finally told me that he’s been thinking about leaving me for almost a year now and therapy helped him understand that. I was shocked and asked what was the deal and why; he explained that he still loves me and there’s no other woman, he just thinks it’s a choice he should make and that it’s 50/50 chance he would actually do it.

Now I’m stuck in this house with him and thinking what to do myself...

Please don’t post recommendations such as ‘just leave him’ because we’ve been together for more than 6 years and have seen lots of ups and  downs... I myself have been battling with lots of mental issues and he supported me all the way.

For now I see only two options 

•to be supportive and wait
•to prepare myself mentally for a breakup and slowly initiate it

Tl;dr bf says it’s 50/50 chance he’ll leave me."
"I (15f) have panic attacks when men raise their voices due to childhood abuse and its starting to affect my life.


Throwaway because siblings. 

Basically, I have a large number of siblings, my mom, and my father. My father very heavily mentally abused my siblings and I as well as irregular physical abuse. My mom pretty much pretended none of it was happening but I kind of understand it and don't resent her for it at all although it definitely changes the family dynamic a lot.

My oldest siblings took most of the abuse while I was just slightly behind them in the abuse 'rankings' if you will. The 3 youngest where thankfully never hit and rarely yelled at by him  (although that doesn't mean they didn't feel the affects of his mental abuse) 

The result is that I have panic attacks when men raise their voices even when he's  just calling his dog. This has never really been an issue and I honestly didn't even notice it until recently  because my father thoroughly isolated us from the rest of the world (homeschool, living far away from anyone we may know, moving every two years, activly trying to make us afraid of other people etc) 

This spring though, my mom divorced my father and he's only aloud to see us while supervised. We've started dance classes and art classes and today I did my first soccer practice. 

Here lies the issue at hand; my soccer coach is very loud when coaching. I was able to handle it most of the day but then I messed something up and he started loudly instructing me on how to do it right and I started panicking and shaking. I felt like I was back with my father and all I can do is stand there and take the blow but I can't look scared or cower because then he freaks out saying I'm 'making him look like some kind of abuser' and it all gets so much worse. Because of this I've learned to control my facial expressions and body language to look fairly normal when panicking so the coach didn't notice. And because I was panicking I didn't hear what he said and mess it up again causing a vicious cycle and everyone on the team to hate me for messing up and think I'm slow.

I mentioned this to my mom but she just sort of said that I'll have to find a way to work through it and then later mentioned learning some breathing techniques to help with anxiety but I know that's just one of those things she says but forgets about instantly and honestly I just really need some support. 

I could try to talk to my brother but he always complains about people always 'unloading their issues onto him' and i really don't want him to feel that way about me. I honestly just really need someone to tell me what I'm supposed to do. I'm so sick of constantly feeling my way through the dark and stumbling my way through everything in life.

Our family motto is pretty much ""ignore it until it goes away and if it doesn't, live with it' 
but I don't want to live like that anymore. 

I also just feel like such a shitty person for feeling like this. I finally have everything I ever wanted in life and I still can't be happy with it. Lots of people get smacked around as kids or yelled at everyday and they deal with it just fine. Why am I the only one in my family who has panic attacks like this When my mom and older siblings had it worse? I just feel really lost and I'm supsed to be so happy.  

Is there anyone else who has panic attacks like this? How do you deal with it? I'm not sure what kind of advice you can give such a mess lol but it's worth a try.
 
Sorry if this post is a little scatterbrained I wanted to get it out there before I chicken out.

TL;DR
I have panic attacks when men raise their voices due to childhood abuse and its causing me to have multiple throughout socker practice and I don't know how to deal with it."
"My girlfriend [37f] and I [47m] have been together 3 years and a reoccurring issue has finally come to a head.


Long time lurker, throwaway, etc.

I love my girl with all my heart. We are compatible in almost every way. Communicate well, great sex life, both home bodies. I should mention that we live separately (30 mins apart) and we are both still raising our kids from previous marriages. Our kids get along great and we always have a good time when we’re together.

My past relationships have been textbook breakups, some were more painful than others, but generally I’ve come through without any major damage. She, on the other hand, was cheated on by her ex-husband, and some relationships after her divorce were also painful. For example, the boyfriend she was seeing before me would spend his free time with another girl “just a friend” and although she was suspicious she let it go in the name of trust. Well, they broke up and the ex-boyfriend immediately was with that other girl. My girl brushes it off but I believe it’s done some serious damage to her ability to trust. Here’s where our problem comes in.

I have never cheated on her. I have no desire to cheat. I have given her no reason to believe I’m capable of cheating. And, lastly, I have a poor opinion of cheaters. As I’ve said, I love her boundlessly, but I’m having a moral dilemma. I have a past co-worker/friend who likes to make plans for a lunch when she’s in town (maybe once a year) - I’ll call her Jane. Early on, when I was dating my girlfriend, lunch with Jane didn’t seem to be an issue. Well, it was I learned. My girlfriend has serious anxiety over me spending time with Jane.

After I discovered this we tried compromises, like all of us going to lunch together. She didn’t like that idea, so she requested when it happens I just don’t tell her. I didn’t like that idea because it “felt” like cheating.

Jane is back in town and asked me to lunch. She told me she is in a new relationship and is excited to tell me about it. I didn’t tell my girl because I didn’t want to upset her. But then I did (well before the lunch date) because it seemed crazy to withhold and innocent get-together. She responded with “have fun” and blocked me on social media. I find this childish but, like I mentioned, the girl has been seriously been messed up by other men.

A few days have passed, I cancelled the lunch with Jane, which sucks because she is truly a friend that I enjoy hearing from. My girl and I are talking through this, but we are not able to agree on a solution. She feels I am picking Jane over her, I feel (very strongly) that I should not prune my friends because of her insecurities.  Last night we agreed that she would be invited to any future lunches... great. This morning I woke up to a long email telling me that she is still hurting, and I actually didn’t compromise anything. In her eyes I’m still ‘choosing’ Jane over her.

The thought that we might actually break up over this is killing me. I love this woman so much, more that I’ve ever loved anyone. Please help us rationally get through this.

TL;DR: Girlfriend gets triggered when I have an occasional lunch with an old female co-worker/friend. Girlfriend doesn’t feel I’ve compromised a solution. This has become a dealbreaker issue."
"I (31M) have no idea how to get my (35F) wife to contribute to the household


We've been married for 5 years now and off and on for what would seem to total a over half of it, I have been the only one working which is causing us several fights and money has always been the source of major resentment.

We married on a quick whim after being head over heals for 6 months and I thought everything would be great. She was planning on finishing a medical degree and I was waiting to promote after just coming off a few surgeries from combat injuries. She was very supportive and caring, her family liked me and I liked them, and she said that she didn't have an issue with moving around since she was ready for a change of scenery. However, after getting married things were not great.

By the second week of our marriage we were getting collection notices for loans she had defaulted on and thought would just go away or that her parents would take care of. Since neither of those things were happening, I had to come up with almost $15,000 to stop the collections since she had no savings and her job at the time was working part-time for minimum wage at her friend's business to help get it off the ground. So immediately I felt very caught off guard and taken advantage of.  There went all my savings and money became very tight since our combined income was hovering around 30K a year before taxes and I had taken out a small loan to cover a portion of it. I tried to speak to her parents about helping pay for it but got no where and after growing up in an abusive home I don't speak to hardly anyone in my family to reach out to for help.

Fast forward to today, we are over 10K in card debt, she doesn't work, never went back to school, and says if her mom never worried about money she shouldn't have to either. But her dad ""only makes about 150K"" and I am not even close to that. I have tried to show her how to budget, what our finances look like, I have even threatened to cancel her cards but since I am gone a good bit I don't want her to not be covered in case something happens.

I have resorted to having secret accounts and hiding money across multiple banks to make sure the bills get paid. I feel like such a bad husband having to hide things but I don't know what else to do. I try to talk to her but she gets very emotional about it and says my job choice is what's really causing money troubles. Ever since paying off her debt just to still end up in debt makes me so angry, disgusted, resentful, and upset.  I don't feel supported in relationship anymore and I am at a loss as to what to try if financial classes, articles, or just old fashion communication and counseling isn't working.

**tldr. Can't get my spouse to get a job or stop running up debt while deployed/traveling even after talking about it and getting counseling so what are more options?**"
"My sister in law [F/24] went to my [M/24] house to do laundry when I was out of town, left my chemical closet open when I told her to close it, left my niece [3] unattended when she took a shower and is blaming me for my niece having to go to the hospital for drinking chemicals — how do I fix this?


I was out of town for work, and my sister in law called me to ask if she could go over to my house to take a shower, do their laundry and give my niece a bath, because they’re having water issues at my brother’s house. Of course I said that it wasn’t an issue, my brother gives her the spare key and when she gets there I get another call to say that there is no more detergent in my bottle and she forgot to bring her own, so I told her that there is more in the closet, but I also told her that toxic chemicals are in the closet that I use for darkroom/photography stuff and that she has to make sure that she closes and locks it immediately so that my cat doesn’t go in there. Later I get a call from my brother that they’re at the hospital with my niece, apparently my sister in law didn’t close the closet and left my niece unattended in the house while she took a shower, and she decided to drink some of my chemicals. I went to the airport, and went straight to the hospital, thank God my niece is fine and I offered to pay any medical bills because my brother’s job doesn’t give the family coverage, but as soon as I get in the room to see my niece who I love so much my sister in law smacks me in the face and accuses me of almost killing her daughter, I told her that I told her specifically to lock the closet, she said “well if you didn’t have pyrocatechol in your closet my baby wouldn’t have drank it.” Pyrocatechol is used to develop black and white film, I know that photo developing chemicals are dangerous which is why I keep them locked away and follow the proper precautions. She kept screaming at me in the hallway of the hospital and she wouldn’t let me go see my niece, I had to wait until she went to the bathroom for my brother to let me in and tell her that I love her. My brother knows that his wife is being ridiculous but he is sort of cowardly and won’t stand up for me to her. She told me that I can’t see my niece anymore because of this, which is like a knife in the heart for me. How should I handle this, I feel like she feels guilty about being irresponsible and is trying to blame me so that she doesn’t have to blame herself.


**TL;DR:** My sister in law went to my house when I was out of town, left a chemical closet open when I told her to lock it, left my niece unattended to take a shower and is now blaming me that my niece had to go to the hospital for drinking chemicals."
"UPDATE: I told my [33] parents [65/70] they couldn't move in with us. They got really upset. Then they calmed the eff down. Then my alcoholic/addict brother [29] burned down their old house.

&amp;#x200B;

It's funny, because in the weeks before my brother burned down our parents' old house (they formerly lived out there, and wanted to fix it up and move back eventually--this was not the place they sold and had to move out of in the last post), my husband and I were told not to go and pick up stuff from that house because my parents didn't ""feel safe"" with us being out there. Not sure why--maybe they were projecting. We would never take something that didn't belong to us (husband + me). I mostly just wanted to collect my childhood stuff that was still there and my art supplies, now that we have space for them. A couple weeks later, my brother, who was living out there b/c they had decided to move away from the area and rent an apartment in another city short-term (and he was going to fix it up for them to either move back into it or sell it), trashed it and then burned it to the ground. Now he's out on bail and may go to prison. My parents hired him an attorney. My husband and I are no longer the scapegoats! Suddenly they talk to me! They want to know how things are going! They want to hang out with us! Initially though they did blame me for my brother burning down the house. They said it wouldn't have happened if we had just allowed them + my brother to live with us, but I feel like that would have been our house that my brother would have burned down if we hadn't said no. Right? I don't know, maybe I'm blowing this way out of proportion. I actually watched it burn b/c my husband and I were worried about my brother and he had said some things to my parents that seemed odd so we drove out there only to get there just as the first firefighters were arriving on scene, so I may be too close to the situation to have good perspective on it. Thankfully nobody was hurt.

&amp;#x200B;

I mean, it's terrible my brother burned down their old house. Don't get me wrong, that part is super fucking shitty. All my photos and mementos from childhood are gone. But having a relationship with them again where they don't blame us for stuff that we didn't do is just great. Yes, I'm seeing a therapist.

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR: my brother burned down my parents' old house so I'm no longer the scapegoat. Yay? "
"My boyfriend (26M) of 6 months found out the girl he was seeing for a brief time was pregnant - two weeks prior to her due date. The baby was born yesterday. I’m 24(F) and independent, not even sure if I want kids of my own. I’m in love with him, but, selfishly, I don’t know if I can stay with him.


Well, where do I even begin? I fell for a friend I used to see out often. We’ve been friends for a couple of years, we’d Snapchat a bit but nothing ever came of it; I’d see him out and such and that’s really it. We had a mutual group of friends we’d both meet up with. He came over my house one night after the bar because our friends sort of bailed and he needed a ride because he’d been drinking. I told him he could stay over my place and I’d take him home in the morning. He slept beside me in my bed and didn’t make a single move, and I found that so attractive. We’d always been sort of flirty, but I love the way he didn’t try anything. I instantly started crushing. We went for sushi a couple of weeks later, no intentions. I asked him to go bowling afterward because I still wanted to hang out. After bowling, he came over my house and we watched movies and drank wine. I drunkenly gained the confidence to make out with him, I couldn’t hold in my desire any longer. and that was where our relationship dynamic changed. March 30th. I asked him why he never made a move, and he told me that it’s because he knew how I was with guys- that I wasn’t looking- and he didn’t want to overstep his boundaries. Well, I guess I found that super attractive. We slept together that night and it was absolutely incredible.

It’s been six months since we’ve been hanging out regularly, five since we’ve been sleeping together. Over the past two months he stayed at my place with me pretty much every day. He’s an amazing guy; a 26 year old former marine, great morals, very sweet... a true gentleman. I’d been avoiding men and feelings for two and a half years prior to this after a pretty tough heartbreak with no closure. He was the first guy I’d let my guard down for since my ex. He was the first guy I truly loved since then. He was the first guy I’ve been with who I feel truly reciprocated my love. Our love isn’t juvenile, it’s a deep sort of love. We can talk about absolutely anything. We are so open and honest with each other. We talk through our differences. It’s a passionate kind of love where you can feel it in your soul. I’m also convinced our sex is better than any sex anyone has, anywhere. It’s raw, intense, and beautiful. It’s all something I never thought I’d experience, and something I never want to lose.

We’re both going through transitional phases in our lives. We both started new jobs in June, we’re both moving to our new places (separately) in September. It just happened to be the way things worked out. He moved in on the first, so I was planning to stay with him until my apartment is ready on the 15th. Plans can change pretty suddenly when you get news like we did. 

Two weeks ago today he got a phone call from this girl he’d been seeing back in November, long before we were seeing each other. They’d only had this fling for maybe two, two and a half months. We were friends at this point, but I didn’t know of the girl or the situation at the time. He’s usually pretty private about his life. Well - she called (a night we weren’t together, oddly enough) and she dropped a huge bomb on him. “I’m pregnant with your baby and I’m due in two weeks.” Excuse me, what? 

He came over my house the next day and completely broke down. He told me the news, and he was so afraid. He didn’t want a baby with her, he wasn’t ready for a baby now- but he’d be damned if he wasn’t going to step up and be the best father he could be to his son. He apologized and told me he’d never have brought me into this situation had he known. My mind was racing. I wanted answers. I wanted to know how; why, who? He recalled a night they had together. He stated they always used protection, but there was a night that the condom broke. He said he asked her to take Plan B, and she refused, stating that she’s on birth control and everything would be fine. The baby was born yesterday, the 5th of September. 

I’ve known for week and a half, and I’ve thought over the situation quite a lot. The day after I found out, I went to work. I felt completely nauseous. I couldn’t focus. I had to leave early. I explained to him I think it’s best to part ways. I am not ready to handle a situation like this. I am an independent twenty-four year old woman. I didn’t even know if I wanted kids of my own. My thoughts never went that far because they didn’t have to. I’m not ready for this. 

He told me he understood. We spent a few days apart, and I missed him more than I thought I would, more than I thought I could. I used to be so fine with being alone. I broke down and went over to his new place. We went out shopping for home goods and it made me fall into picturing a future with him. We became even closer in this time, over this past week. We talked about our life goals and plans. He told me he was saving to move us out West with me; a dream of mine. He’d been offered a job through his company that he could take to San Diego, and I’ve been wanting to move there for quite a while. I began to realize that these are all things that couldn’t really be possible once he has a child. We spent every night this week sort of avoiding the inevitable. We’d drink wine and cook dinner and watch our show together. We had really intense emotional talks, talks about the future we could have had. He even told me he pictures a family with me. He wished the baby was mine instead. I thought about all of this deeply. I could picture a future with him. A family, even. We talked l as if life wasn’t about to completely change. I realized I’ve never felt so close to someone. 

He told me they were planning to induce her Wednesday, the 5th. He got a call that they changed it to Tuesday the 4th. I was expecting one last night of normal with him before I made my ultimate decision. We didn’t have that last night. He went to the hospital the 4th and stayed until the morning. The baby was born just before 830.

I was at work when he told me the news. I’d been checking my phone constantly; waiting. He sent a photo of his son, with a text that said “he’s here,” and I instantly started bawling. I wanted so badly to be happy for him in that moment, but my stomach was inside out. My brain was flooded with thoughts. It was all real. 

I want to be a part of his life SO badly, but reality has hit and I know damn well that I’m not ready to deal with this sort of situation. As much as I want to meet his child and continue to be a part of his life, I can’t. I know it will destroy me if I all of a sudden had to be second, which is what has to happen. His baby is now his number one priority, and I can’t get in the way of that. It sounds selfish, but I wasn’t ready. I know staying with him would destroy me. It would destroy us. I feel awful and I feel selfish. I feel as if my heart is breaking. I’ve never felt anything like it. 

He needs supportive people close by. His family lives out of state, a plane ride away. His friends live all over the country, only a few live within driving distance. I’ve never met his family. He texted me not long after the baby was born that his family is coming to visit and meet him. On top of all of this, he wants me to meet his mother when she flies up. I have a hard time swallowing the fact that I’d meet his mother after she meets his ex hookup-buddy and their new child. I can’t handle the thought of that. I never expected to meet her in this scenario. 

I went over his place during my lunch break and gathered the few belongings I had there. He told me he wasn’t going to be home for another hour so I figured I’d go while he wasn’t there. Goodbyes are not easy for me. I sat on his bed and wrote him an apology letter. I cleaned the kitchen and left it on the island beneath a coaster. This was how I planned to make my dramatic exit. I was going to just leave my keys and go. (I knew that I’d probably still text him and make sure he’s okay, catch up on things, etc, but I felt as if this was easiest for both of us). As I was leaving and locking the door, a voice behind me said “hey.” It was him. My hands began to tremble and I dropped the keys. I rested my head against the doorway and began to cry. He came over and rubbed my back and said everything would be okay. I hugged him and congratulated him. He asked me to come inside. Reluctantly, I did. 

I went and lay on his bed and stared at the ceiling. He came over and we talked about his experience. He loves his new son so much. Its a beautiful thing. I told him I had to go, I couldn’t do it. I’m not ready. I’m not able. My heart and my mind is so conflicted. We cried together. We held each other. We both told each other that everything was going to be okay. 

I know everything will be okay, but I feel terrible leaving him behind when he needs support. I want to be there for him and I wish I was strong enough to accept this situation. I don’t like this girl for what she did. I can’t stand her, and she will have so much control over his life now. They will be sharing all of these special moments about their child together and I’d be on the sidelines. I feel as if meeting their child would be an imposition. My mind is a jumbled mess. Am I making the right decision by separating myself from this situation? My heart is breaking. 

TL;DR: He suddenly has a newborn and I feel terrible leaving him when he needs support. I want to be there for him and I wish I was strong enough to accept this situation.

"My friends [24m 25f] found out how much money i [25f] save, and they think I'm being crazy



I save a lot because I don't really have a safety net to fall back on and I want to be set for life. My parents were abusive so I'm no longer in contact with them. 

I have a job as an engineer and I make 62k a year, and put just over half my salary into savings or investment. (For retirement, a house, and an emergency fund)

I don't have student loans because i got a full scholarship

I still have a lot of fun, I hang out with my friends, take road trips sometimes, hunt and fish, and go on dates. It's not like I'm living like a hermit to save money or anything.

I recently was drinking with my friends Jen and Alex, and Jen made some comment about me being underpaid because I was still living in my college apartment and driving an old pickup truck. I said I was paid just fine, I was just trying to set myself up for later rather than live it up now. They asked for details, and I said what I said in this post, that I make 62k and save over half of it. They were shocked by that, and since then have made a lot of comments about how I'm saving way too much, how I'm being ridiculous and I don't need to keep driving my old truck, etc. 

But they're not in a situation that they'd have nowhere to go if they lost their jobs and couldn't afford to keep their apartments. They can, and have gone back to their families. Alex's dad bought him a SUV this year. And Jen spent a summer living with her parents between jobs. I'm not in that same position. When I'd finished college and was looking for a job i was sleeping in my car

Both of them have been trying to convince me to move, to buy a new car, to get myself stuff, now that they know i have the money. And it's just not what I want to do.

How can I explain to them why I don't have the same priorities?

TLDR -I save a lot because I don't have anyone to rely on financially. My friends don't get it"
"Me [33M] with my wife [29F] of two years. Our baby was born really early (25 weeks) and my wife blames herself for ""having a useless body"" (her words). How do I help her?


My wife, Jamie, and I didn't plan to get pregnant, but we did. We were surprisingly happy about it and started planning for our little family. 

Jamie did everything right during the pregnancy, but our baby girl decided that she wanted to be born ridiculously early about four weeks ago. Things are looking up for us, she's getting stronger by the day and is doing great, all things considered. 

Jamie isn't doing as well, however. She loves our baby with the whole of her heart and I almost have to drag her away from the hospital to get some sleep and a shower. But she keeps blaming herself for what happened. She thinks that there's something she did wrong, even though the doctors have told us that this is just something that happens occasionally. 

She spends hours at home just googling things that could cause early labour and tries to convince herself that she's done all of those things, though she definitely didn't. 

I've managed to get her to go and see a psychiatrist and she's gotten diagnosed with Post-Partum Depression. She just recently started treatment for it, so there hasn't been much change yet. 

My question is: what can I do to help her? 

I do a lot around the house, but I don't want to do everything so that she still has something to busy herself with if she needs to. Of course, if she doesn't feel up for it, I do it. I don't want to put extra pressure on her. 

Thanks in advance!

Also, I'm sorry if this is a bit ramble-y. I haven't slept well lately, for obvious reasons. 

TL;DR: Baby was born extremely early and wife blames herself. She's been diagnosed with PPD. What can I do to help?

"My [25M] bother [25M] is obsessed with fish and I think there is something wrong with him


I hadn’t seen my brother in over 5 years so I was really excited to spend the week at his house after so long. But after seeing him and staying in his house I really think there is something wrong with him. First of all, his house is full Aquariums. Now, don’t get me wrong, these tanks are amazing. You can tell that he really cares about the fish. The problem is that there are tons of them everywhere. Nearly every wall is covered in racks of tanks.



But it’s not the fish I’m worried about, but my brother. He seems to take great care of the fish but not himself. He’s morbidly obese, if I were to guess he’s like, 500 pounds. And I’m pretty sure he eats nothing but convenience food and takeout because there was no food in his house at all. Just stuff for fish.

 I think he’s really depressed. He didn’t want to leave his house when I suggested we hang out somewhere. He didn’t want to see any of our family, even our parents. He seems to only be happy when he’s taking care of his fish or talking about his fish. When I asked him if he was doing okay he insists that he’s doing fine. But I know there is something bothering him. It hurts to see him like this. What do I do? How do I help him? I’ve never dealt with this before! I just want him to be okay again.

TL;DR: My brother is obsessed with fish and is showing signs of depression

"Me [26F] with my boyfriend [27M] of 4 months, something weird happened last night and need some insight


I'll try to make this as short and sweet as possible. So my boyfriend and I, we'll call him Ryan, have been dating about 4 months now. I stayed over at his place last night and we had a nice night of having dinner and playing games. Good vibes all around. We went to sleep, and at about 4 AM I woke up after adjusting my pillow to have a huge jug of water spill over onto the ground and almost touching a power strip. I said ""WTF"" because it startled me and I asked him why there was a huge jug of water with no lid on it on the night stand beside the power chord and was concerned about the electricity.

Ryan then goes berzerk and gets on top of me with both arms on either side of my shoulders and is like ""You ungrateful bitch I put this water there for you in case you got up in the middle of the night and were thirsty. You unnappreciative bitch"", etc. and called me more expletives. All I say at this point was that I was just concerned that a huge jug of water with no lid was sitting close to where a power strip was and could have posed a hazard.

Ryan then takes the full jug of water and tosses it aggressively across the room, spilling it everywhere and goes back to sleep. My question is, is this something I should let go because maybe he was half awake and doesn't remember it? We woke up this morning and he was all sweet as usual and made me breakfast, no mention of this incident. It just concerns me how aggressive he was about it and how he started name calling over something so stupid. Should I address him about it next time I see him/is this something I should be concerned about?

**TL;DR, boyfriend went crazy over me being concerned about an open jug of water by the bedside, got aggressive and name called/threw the jug across the room. What do?**"
"My (39F) husband (40M, married 4 years) is driving me freaking crazy about blowjobs


My husband and I have a GREAT sex life. We have sex 5+ times a week, pretty adventurous, fantastic for both of us. He is very into going down on me and I am super enthusiastic about blowing him. I would say that I blow him at least 3x a week, probably more.

We had a period a couple of months ago where I got the flu and then strep throat super badly. This meant that bj frequency went pretty severely down for about 2 weeks. He complained, I explained why, we resumed our usual frequency.

Except now he will not freaking stop complaining that he had to ask. Every single time he makes a big deal that he has to beg for it, that I don’t actually want to do it, I’m only doing it because he made a thing of it, etc etc etc. Oh, right, and this passive aggressive bullshit about how blowjobs stop after marriage and he should just accept that. Also that I am uninterested and a cold fish about it.

Exactly NONE of this is true. This dude is still getting blown 3+ times a week, with great enthusiasm and vigor. He definitively does NOT have to even ask for it. I am super happy to up the frequency, and have told him that and have tried to implement it, but it’s just back to how I’m only doing that because he begged and he shouldn’t have had to ask blah blah blah.

I am at the end of my goddamned rope. This is making me never want to blow him ever because it’s so much ridiculous drama and pretty shitty stuff to say to me. I have tried, repeatedly, to talk to him about this calmly and supportively, and he just does the passive aggressive thing about how it’s not a problem and he just needs to get over the fact that I don’t want to blow him and he’s one of those pathetic guys who has to beg.

What. The. Fuck. Reddit. How do I deal with this in a healthy way?

TL;DR: Husband gets vigorously blown several times a week but will not stop complaining  about how I don’t want to blow him.

"How do I [28M] deal with family and acquaintances who constantly shame me about being a barista?


Hello Reddit,

&amp;#x200B;

As the title says, I'm a 28 year old coffee shop employee. I've had my chances to advance in the company, say, to shift supervisor or even go to management training, but I've always wished to remain an everyday barista. I work full time at my particular store and am thus entitled to health benefits and a 401K retirement account, which, since I've been in the company for over a decade, I have several tens of thousands of dollars in it. 

&amp;#x200B;

I make enough so that I could rent my own studio apartment, but prefer to room with an elderly couple \[76M, 75F\] whose own children are grown and live out of state with their own families. In addition to paying rent for my room, I do all the physical chores around their house such as repairs and mowing the lawn. They treat me like their own kid and I eat dinner with them whenever I am home. I like my arrangement because it allows me to sock more money away for a rainy day.

&amp;#x200B;

I have my hobbies and like to paint. The couple I live with is extremely supportive of my hobby and have insisted that I hang some of my paintings to decorate their house. They show up and support me whenever my art finds its way into various galleries around town. My art sells, but not enough to replace my barista job.

&amp;#x200B;

My trouble is, my family always mocks me for being a failure. I went to community college and hold an AA in art history which I paid for myself. My parents paid for my older sister's Ivy League education for theater arts and don't mock her for not being a famous actress or otherwise involved in the entertainment industry, because she married a doctor. My parents pretty much bankrupted them

&amp;#x200B;

Whenever I visit my parents' house for holidays, I never have fun because they always treat me like a failure to launch. My other relatives treat me the same way even though many of them have multiple bankruptcies and have hundreds of thousands of dollars in debt for houses and business schemes that didn't pan out. They are constantly asking my parents to bail them out with loans. My dad inherited most of his fortune from his own father including my grandfather's business. I've never asked my parents for so much as a penny since I moved out at 18.

&amp;#x200B;

Unlike most of my relatives, I don't owe anyone a dime. I have friends and socialize but my mother \[60F\] in particular calls me a disappointment straight to my face because I don't have a house or ""even your own apartment,"" and says all of my friends are losers and failures, too.

&amp;#x200B;

It's not like I can do (or want to do) like she did and just marry a dude (my father, 58M) who already inherited his house from his own parents. My father also lambasts me all the time for not having a successful career or being married already and having children, like my sister does (my sister 36, has two kids, 6M, 3F).

&amp;#x200B;

They constantly call all of my friends losers because they tend to be actors or singers who have low-paying regular jobs like I do.

I have no trouble finding women to date me but my parents call these women all manner of terrible epithets.

&amp;#x200B;

I don't depend on my parents for support but I still feel terrible whenever they say mean things to me. It's weird that they act like they hate me, but then insist on having me come around for various holidays.

&amp;#x200B;

My sister doesn't take up for me at all and lets her son disrespect me to my face without correcting him. For example, at a 4th of July party this past summer, the son tells me that I work at McDonalds and am broke. Rather than correcting him when she overheard her son say this, or apologize for putting the idea in his head, my sister just laughs and says he has a vivid imagination.

&amp;#x200B;

All over Facebook, people associated in one way or another to my family neg me on the regular.

&amp;#x200B;

It's not so easy going no contact because I am of Asian descent and family is a huge thing with my particular relatives. Going no contact with them is basically me telling all of them I hope they die, which I don't wish to do.

&amp;#x200B;

They're also really racist and neg me over my girlfriends, who tend to be hip and around my age but also usually caucasian. Then the ""sellout"" accusations go flying around. My sister was engaged to a White lawyer before she eventually married her Chinese doctor husband and no one gave her flak for it, so I don't get why they pick on me.

&amp;#x200B;

They flat out refuse to meet my girlfriend now-fiancée \[30F\] of two years who is a receptionist but also a popular Youtuber, because she is \[insert racist and sexist epithet here\] and supposedly ""even a bigger loser than me.""

&amp;#x200B;

The people I live with are both White and they never have anything mean to say to me, ever, and actually seem to enjoy having me around. The couple were really pleased when my fiancée told them we are expecting a baby. My fiancée have talked about moving into our own apartment because with our combined salaries we can easily afford one bedroom, and although it would be a tight stretch, maybe even two bedrooms (we both live in Echo Park, California).

&amp;#x200B;

The couple I live with very seriously offered to rent to my fiancée too at a reasonable price, and we are considering it. In their words, ""We would adore having your little family with us.""

&amp;#x200B;

On the other hand, my own parents treated the news of my fiancée's pregnancy as an even bigger disaster than the fact that we are engaged in the first place.

&amp;#x200B;

I just don't get it. I've never gotten into any trouble as a kid, caused any problems. I just lived my life, did well in school, never failed any classes. When I was in high school my art teacher approached my mom about what he perceived to be potential in me to be an artist, but even then my mom crapped all over the idea of me being an artist.

&amp;#x200B;

Any advice on how to cope with my family? I mean, what are some strategies I can use when I'm around them, to make them leave me alone regarding my financial, work, or romantic situation? My fiancée is also really bummed that my family not only hates her but also seems to despise me. Yet, I feel tied to them.

&amp;#x200B;

Her family treats me awesome which I appreciate.

&amp;#x200B;

HELP!

&amp;#x200B;

\*\*tl;dr: how to deal with parents that always neg me for having a low paying job despite me being happy with life?\*\*

"My [26M] ""friend"" [26F] treats my girlfriend [23F] poorly. I want to ice her out, but she's now seriously dating my best friend [28M].


Throwaway, etc. Apologies for the length; I didn't want to omit anything important.  


I am in my graduate program with Megan \[26F\], and we have been really good friends for the entire time she's been in it (1.5 years.) About six months ago, I started dating Jessie \[23F\].

Jessie is fantastic. She is brilliant, funny, and incredibly kind - a wonderful conversationalist who always has a funny story to tell, yet is an empathetic listener who can bring out the best in people and validate their thoughts and feelings. She's advanced in her career, especially considering her age, and attends the best graduate program in her field. I am impressed by her, love her deeply, and feel that she's the one for me.

  
Early in our relationship, Jessie met my friends, including Megan and my best friend Adam \[28M\], among around a dozen other people. All of my friends love Jessie and commend me on finding someone like her, except for Megan, who said something offhand like she's ""glad \[I'm\] happy.""  I shared the news with Jessie, and she raised an eyebrow and said that was girl code for ""I don't like your girlfriend, but you're happy, so whatever."" I didn't read into it too much and let it go.  


Over the next few months, when we hung out as a group a handful of times, it became pretty clear that Megan was not treating Jessie as an equal or even nicely. She would interrupt Jessie when speaking.  She commented on the playlist (that Jessie had made) saying it was ""trash."" When Jessie asked what kind of music she'd prefer, and offered to change it, Megan said that her taste was ""too niche"" for Jessie to know about. If Jessie asked her a question, she would either ignore it or turn the conversation back to something our friend group had done together, excluding Jessie from participating in the conversation. Her comments regularly negged Jessie and implied that Megan's hobbies were ""cool"" and Jessie's were basic and laughable.

At one point at a party, Jessie left the room because she felt so uncomfortable with Megan's passive-aggressive behavior. She explained to me how Megan was treating her (which admittedly, I only noticed about half of at first, but in hindsight see how it was rude) and told me she felt Elle Woods offering muffins to her law school study group - not cool and hip enough for the party even though she was just trying to be nice.   


Later, I spoke to Megan and asked her to make more of an effort to get to know Jessie the next time we all hung out. She apologized (to me) for treating Jessie poorly, and said that she would, and that it's ""not the first time a guy friend's girlfriend has been jealous of her."" When I told my girlfriend this, she felt frustrated, because the issue wasn't one of jealousy, but of basic kindness, and felt that Megan was reframing it to make Jessie look jealous and crazy instead of just admitting that she (Megan) was rude.  


At the next event we all were at, Megan made no effort to even speak to Jessie once, much less ""get to know her"" like she'd promsied me. She actually went as far to mock her outfit for being ""too chesty"" to other girls I thought were my friends when I and Jessie were both within earshot. I could tell by Jessie's face that she heard.  


Jessie asked me what I value about Megan's friendship. I told her she was the first person to make me feel included when I moved to our city, which is true. Jessie replied that she has no clue what it would feel like to be included by Megan, and asked that I respect she won't be coming to future events where Megan is attending.  


At this point, I have no interest in being friends with Megan outside of our graduate program. Someone who treats the woman I love this poorly doesn't get a spot on my list of friends, as far as I'm concerned. If Megan is at an event, I won't be going, either -- instead doing something that Jessie wants to do.

&amp;#x200B;

The issue, though, is that Megan is now dating my best friend, Adam. It sounds from him like it's getting fairly serious. He's starting to ask about double-dates and wanting to bring Megan around to more events. I offered to talk to Adam about Megan's behavior, but Jessie thinks this would cause further drama that she's not interested in having. I don't want to give up my best friend or spend less time with him, which we already have little of due to our busy schedules. What should I do?  


**TL;DR:** My former good friend and current classmate is rude and unkind to my girlfriend. Even after a conversation about it, she only upped the ante. I'd like to ice her out, but now she's dating my best friend."
"My [25F] mother [55F] tried to jump out of a moving car to get away from me today


Hi reddit, 

This is extremely long so please bear with me. My family moved to the US when I was 7 years old away from our native country. At 15 my parents had an extremely nasty divorce which resulted in my brother and I having to pick whether we went back to our native country with our mom, or stayed in the US with our dad. My brother picked first and went with our dad, I didn't want to leave my mother alone so I decided to stay with her

That's where the real issues began, during that year I would fight with my mother constantly. It was a nightmare. So at the end of the school year I told my mom I wanted to go live with my dad (He was, of course, aware and more than happy with it). We had been talking the whole time I was having a hard time with my mom and he was super supportive and kind. I think she saw this as a huge betrayal and an abandonment. I moved back here (US), and ever since, I've been fighting with her everytime I see her (which is about a week each year when I go back to native country, or she comes here)

The reason for all the fighting, put simply, is that I'm easily irritated by my mother, and when I voice that irritation it snowballs into a massive argument that goes to extremely high levels of insanity. 

Today's example: My mom came to visit me as I've been having a tough go recently (boyfriend issues, new job, overall sadness). We went to a spa for the day, and there I kind of branched off while we were doing saunas, because I don't have super high tolerance for heat. She made a comment about not spending the sap day together, and how it didn't make sense. I answered a bit brusquely that I don't stand heat well and I need to be outside. She continued with her day, clearly annoyed. Later I asked her if she was almost ready to leave, and she got more pissed off, just packed her stuff and went to wait by the car. I also got my stuff and tried to give her a hug to thank her for the spa, but she said no, and went in the car. 

I got in the drivers' seat and we left, arguing as I asked her why she was acting pissy. Things got worst, as the usual escalation happened, she told me she shouldn't come visit me anymore cause I have a shitty attitude and that her friends always tell her she shouldn't come cause I make her miserable. I told her I didn't force her to come, and if she doesn't want to, she doesn't have to. Then she got angrier and angrier, saying her usual things: That she gets along with everyone except me, that she grieves for our relationship, and that she doesn't know what to do with me. 
I'm answering minmally at this point and pretty calm I keep saying things like ""OK"" and ""Fine, you do that."" She striked a nerve when she said ""I understand why you can't work things out with your boyfriend"" and I answered that it's better than not being able to open up to any relationship like she does (low blow, I know). 
This is when the insanity happened. She started screaming at the top of her lungs for 30 seconds straight (Just AAHHH). Then she screamed ""You destroy me"" repeatedly. The situation was so surreal I started kind of laughing just because I couldn't believe it, and I told her ""You're insane"". She then took off her seatbelt and opened the door of the car (this is going 65 on the highway). I pulled the car over on the emergency lane, and told her to stop, that she was insane while I was holding on to her so she wouldn't fall out. She bit my hand and hit me a couple of times. Then we screamed at each other some more and drove home in silence. And now I'm sitting here. 

What do I do Reddit? I don't know what to do. I don't know how you can push someone to be like this, but somehow I manage to do it, and this has been going on for 10 years. Do I go no contact? Do I just not say anything anymore? I really don't know what to do. 

TLDR: My mom and I fight all the time, every little thing becomes a huge uncontrollable argument and I don't know what to do about it. "
"*UPDATE* [23F] My best friend [23M] ditched me for his relationship.


A few days ago, I made a [post ](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/9enca1/23f_my_best_friend_23m_ditched_me_for_his_new/?st=JLZUHRWO&amp;sh=46105526) about how my best male friend ditched me when he got into a new relationship.

Since my post, he messaged me again explaining that he missed me and that he doesn’t want me to think that he’s forgotten about me and how he knows that he’s been absent but it’s only temporary. He also mentioned that he wishes he could go into detail about why he’s been so distant but I guess he can’t. I told him that if he ever needed to talk about anything that I’ll always be there. I also told him that even though it sucks that we don’t speak anymore, he obviously knows what’s best for himself and he’s gotta follow that.  Anyway, even though I’m still not fully sure why he grew distant, I’m no longer super upset about it because we finally had the talk that I felt we needed to. I don’t think he’s mad at me anymore but I do think it might have something to do with how his girlfriend feels. Why would he say he wish he could tell me? I’m really not sure. But I’d thought I’d update you guys since i had so many comments. Thanks for the help.

TLDR: My friend who I thought ditched me for his relationship messaged me letting me know he wishes that he could explain why he grew distant. "
"My niece [8F] thinks her flower dress for my [25F] wedding is too open in the back and she is worried her psoriasis will show. How do I respond?


I showed my niece the flower girl dress I am going to order for her for my wedding and she saw something like ""Aww I wish the back was more closed"" (it's honestly not open it looks like a corset kind of back and there is material until under her shoulder bones) and I said why? And she reponded (quietly) ""I don't want my back scars to show"". Wrenched my heart. 

I don't know how to respond. On one hand to make her feel comfortable I can tell her we can add material to the back so it's less mesh like but I feel like then I am teaching her that she should cover her psoriasis but if I tell her she is beautiful and shouldn't worry about it I feel like she might feel ignored or uncomfortable. 

How do I handle this so that she feels comfortable in her own skin. I don't want my response to instill in her that she should cover her scars. I want to make sure I handle the situation correctly so that she never feels bad about herself and maybe learns something from the experience.

TL;Dr : My niece is insecure about her psoriasis and commented about her flower girl dress being too open. How do I respond ?"
"Husband (23M) hates how I (25F) dress but won’t help me wear things he likes instead


My husband is an amazing person in nearly every way and 99% of our relationship is wonderful. However, he is very appearance and aesthetic conscious. He’s spent a lot of time cultivating a wardrobe where every piece looks stylish and any outfit he randomly throws on ends up looking good. He has strong opinions on the appearance and style choices of other people, including me. I admire his high standards but it does cause some clashing.

I’ve never really been someone who puts a lot of stock in my appearance, and I have more of a casual, alternative style. At the beginning of our relationship I would usually dress up and try to look good for him, but when we got more serious I stopped because he started telling me he actually didn’t like my outfits and because, well, we started living together and I didn’t really care to look my cutest 100% of the time.

My husband hates how I dress and makes no secret of this fact. At one point he was telling me almost every day that he thought I was dressed badly. I have no desire to change my personal style completely, but it does bother me that he thinks this because I love him and care about his opinion. So I’ve asked him multiple times to help me pick out some new clothes, or to give me new clothes for my birthday, or even just to give me some style guidelines to work with so I can pick things out myself, but he refuses, because doing those things would make him feel controlling and he doesn’t want to tell me what I should wear. He knows I have a long history of abuse, and he is extremely worried about abusing me or treating me badly himself. I’ve tried telling him it can’t be controlling if it’s something I’m asking him for, but it doesn’t get through.

I definitely feel much worse about myself because of this. I logically know I don’t look bad because I get compliments on my appearance and clothing from strangers a lot, but the only opinion I really care about apart from my own is my husband’s, so it hurts when he tells me I’m fat and he doesn’t like a single one of my shirts. I’ve explained this to him too, but he doesn’t seem to quite get it. He always says “but you didn’t care about your appearance at all until a few months ago!” which, yeah, because no one was constantly putting it down back then. He did stop for a while when I first told him but it’s starting to come back up. I would feel MUCH better if I had at least a few outfits I knew he liked, but he’s being very stubborn on this point. 

How can I convince him that helping me find clothes he likes is not controlling and would, in fact, make me feel a lot better than what he’s currently doing does?

Also maybe worth mentioning is that he’s trans and some of the clothes I wear were his pre-transition. He still doesn’t like those, either because he never liked them in the first place or because he doesn’t like how I wear them. So I’m really at a loss unless he helps me.

tl;dr my husband doesn’t like how I dress, I want some clothes in my wardrobe that he actually likes, but he won’t help me because he’s afraid of being controlling."
"Me [35 F] with my husband [39 M/F] (18 years), my father is offering to give me a downpayment for a house with conditions that are offensive to my husband.


Sorry for the wall of text. I wanted to get all the facts out so I could get the best advice. 

I recently told my father I was thinking of moving to a cheaper location (I live thousands of miles from my father and wouldn't be moving where he lives). Houses where I live are extremely expensive (the cheapest I found was 500k and it was a tear down) and so is the COL. 

He offered to give me 100k for a down payment or 20% (whichever is greater). He said he doesn't care if I ever pay him back, but wants something in writing that it's a loan so if my husband and I divorce I will be ""protected."" His words. He said I can draft it.  

I have a professional career and make lower six figures. My husband makes a very small fraction of what I do working his dream job in a creative field. I am completely supportive of this. Since he works from home he does almost 100% of the house work. It's been this way since I finished school and it works. 

My Dad is wealthy and looks down on my Husband for this and thinks my Husband takes advantage of me. This is utter bullshit (and sexist. None of my father's wives have ever worked). My Dad and husband are totally civil and don't argue, but they both clearly dislike each other. It's been this way since we first started dating. 

I stand up for my husband and my dad knows better than to say anything negative about my husband around me. I'll hang up immediately and have in the past told him he treats my husband with respect or I'm out of his life. 

The first time he offered me a downpayment with something to ""protect me"" I told him to fuck off. I'm older now and a little more tempted. It's a lot of money, rent is insanely high, and land prices where I live rise steadily. Due to the cost of living in my area, it will take years for me to save up 100k. 

 I have come up with a way to ""protect"" my husband from my Dad ""protecting"" me. Essentially, it will ensure if my Husband and I divorce (which I can't imagine) my husband will be legally entitled to half the house and I'll be the only one my Dad can go after for the loan. 

It's legally rock solid (I have run it by family law attorneys and a family law judge and they all agree it will work). 


My Husband doesn't like the idea, is offended by my Dad wanting to ""protect me"" (I don't blame him), and doesn't want to take the money. He thinks my idea is ""scamming my dad"" and doesn't want anything from him. I really think we should buy a house to start building equity. 

I have brought up moving to a cheaper location to my Husband and he hates the idea. While I'm ready to move, he absolutely loves where we live and wants to stay. He's a surfer and freediver and we live in one of the best spots in the world for those activities. His job is related to surfing (not a pro surfer), but he can do it remotely and already does. 

I'm stuck and don't know what to do. We spend thousands of dollars a month on rent that could be going towards paying off a mortgage. I really want to buy a house, my Husband isn't concerned. At the same time, it's me that has to work my ass off with insane hours to support us. I don't like my job. I have golden handcuffs because with the cost of living, I can't afford to switch fields, and there isn't much opportunity where we live. I can't put my finger on it, but I think my Husband's position is only considering himself and not me. Am I being the selfish one?   

Any advice for how to navigate these stormy waters? Do I stand up to my Dad and say I'll only accept the money condition free (I doubt he'll agree). Do I refuse it? Do I ask my Husband to do this for me and try to convince him to let us take the money? Do I ask my Husband to decide between taking the money and moving to a cheaper place where we could buy on our own?

Tl;dr: Father has offered to ""loan"" me money to buy a house but it would only be a loan in the event of a divorce. My husband doesn't want to take the money. What do I do? 


Note: My husband and I have done couples counseling at my request (we see the same therapist), but the therapist told us we didn't need it. My Husband hated couple's counseling, but if I get a game plan, I can always set up a joint appointment and use the therapist as a mediator.  "
"My (26F) mother (63F) is in a romance scam and I don't know what to do with our relationship


I could go on for a year about my mother and our relationship but I'll try to hit the relevant parts. I never got along too well with my mother though my sister (36F) always said I did or at least better than she did. My dad passed almost 3 years ago and my SO and I were the ones who handled everything after. My family was always poor so to help with costs she moved in with me after my dad passed. It didn't go well. We agreed that she should move out after a year and she did with money from my grandmother's estate.

A quick note about my grandmother and mother as it is relevant. My grandmother was better with money than my mother and left her worth about 250k when she died. My uncle was the one who handled all of those affairs and it was in my grandmother's will that all the money would go for my mother's retirement since it was common knowledge that my mother didn't have any retirement savings. Some money was initially used to buy her house out right but the rest was put away.

But back to my mother. Within a year of moving out she started taking about this guy she was taking to online. I'm fine with her dating as I knows my dad wanted that but when she started taking about him I got super concerned. Multiple foreign countries were named along with 'travel issues' and then money requests. My uncle helped talk to her but by the time we really got involved she had mailed 4k to a random address. My mother works in a school cafeteria she doesn't have 4k lying around. 

After talking to her about the scam it seemed like it was over. We signed some paperwork giving me power of attorney to hopefully help in case it ever happened again. It happened again. But this time she dipped into those accounts from my grandmother. She's transferred 100k now. My niece, her granddaughter has also since moved in and I think she's skimming social security money my niece receives to send to the scammer.

So the money is gone but what's left is just the pure rage I feel. We talked about scammers the first time and she fell for it immediately again. She was always the miser in the house only allowing $30 for groceries a week and yelling when my dad bought her a flower. I have given her thousands to get her out of debt from bad choices she made before and she just mails 100k to Africa?! I can't even look at her. She knows it's wrong because she won't speak to me now since I asked where the money is going. I picked up my niece for lunch and she ran in the bathroom and hid until I was gone. 

My wedding is in 5 weeks and she's supposed to be there but I seriously don't want to look at her let alone pose smiling with her. I just don't know what to do about the scams and her lying let alone my feelings. I honestly think I would understand more if it was drugs. I can understand addiction better than whatever this pure nonsense is that's happening now. Somewhere very very deep down I'm worried about her. She's almost out of the liquid inheritance and I'm afraid she's going to mortgage her house to give more money. I don't know how I'll respond if she loses her house and is homeless. My SO has no sympathy and living with her before was horrible so she couldn't stay with me. I could probably afford to set her up in an apartment but I would just hate her even more if I did that but I think I'd feel like I have to make sure she isn't homeless.

Tl:dr a Nigerian prince won the scam lottery cash prize of 100k from my mother and I can't process his transactions"
"Me [47M] with my wife [47F] of 18 years, she's having one hell of a midlife crisis


This started I'd say 1-2 years ago. At first I thought it was a couple isolated, out-of-character incidents. Slowly it became a pattern of strange behavior. 

The most recent issue was Saturday night which has finally gotten me to seek advice for dealing with this. 

She went barhopping until midnight then took uber to a nightclub in another city almost an hour away until 4am, lost her phone, stayed with a random guy and called me from his to pick her up the next morning. I woke up to see she'd never come home and was in a panic. How could I know what was going on? She wasn't answering her phone. When I got to this guy's place it was a crappy apartment in a rundown part of town. He and his roommates/girlfriend/I don't know who all these people were, looked like they were completely trashed. They barely acknowledged me. One of them just offered me a joint! When I saw my wife she looked like a junkie hooker...Can't lie. The way her hair and makeup were all messed up, clothing wrinkled, stumbling and bleary-eyed, I was thinking how am I here? How is this our life? 

You have to understand my wife was NEVER remotely impulsive and careless like this before. She didn't do drugs or crash with strangers with no warning. I got her out of there, then on the drive home she couldn't give any real explanation for how her night got so out of control. She passed out for 12 hours when we got home.

I have to guess she's unhappy about getting older. She wants to feel youthful, have fun and escape worries... So do I sometimes but not like this. Isn't this pretty extreme? She doesn't seem to see how dangerous her behavior is becoming. I also really miss just having her at home playing a game or watching movies together. I feel like I barely see her anymore. I feel like she does not care. 

I'm angry, worried, and sad all at once. Any attempt to get answers just ends with her saying vague things that make no sense, or trying to assure me she can handle herself. I don't think she can, honestly.

How can I help?

TL;DR. My wife of 18 years is going through some kind of serious midlife crisis. It shows no signs of stopping any time soon. She's become a very different person than who she was just a couple of years ago."
"How to get rid of houseguest? [25M]


Please help.

I [24F] live in a 2br/1.5ba with my boyfriend [28M]. We typically use the 2nd bedroom as a guest room, which is great for us as we have a bunch of out of town guests that like to come visit from time to time. We're both graduate students so we lead pretty busy lives.

A couple weeks ago, I receive an email from my advisor saying there was a ""visiting scholar"" that would be arriving very soon and had nowhere to stay. Since he would only be around 6-7 weeks and we already had a furnished room, I discussed allowing him to stay with my boyfriend, and we agreed. A decision we would both very quickly come to regret.

This person has been a nightmare. One, he is not a ""visiting scholar"" and in fact has not even conpleted his bachelor's. He's completely useless, having never lived on his own, and harangues us constantly for favors, taking advantage of us at every opportunity. He leaves his light on all night (???) and yesterday flooded the 2nd story bathroom floor through pure idiocy, drenching my desk (as well as articles, notebooks, and textbooks) on the first floor. The enormous stress has caused a rift in my boyfriend and I's relationship and even though this ""guest"" has only been here since Sep. 1, I know right now I cannot and will not tolerate him staying the full 6-7 weeks. The final straw was when he called my boyfriend late last night when we were fast asleep because he irresponsibly missed the last bus and didn't know what to do, and my boyfriend had to coach him through how to download Uber....

Reddit, what can I do? I did not sign up for this. He's not on the lease, and my idea is to tell him to get out before the 15th of this month. He pitched me some money for rent, and I would of course give him back the half he isn't staying for, but please help: how do I keep my sanity and house safe in the meantime? I don't know if I can even handle these next few days with him...

TL;DR: houseguest has become a destructive, needy nightmare. Need help deciding how to best rid my home of this pest before he decimates my home and sanity."
