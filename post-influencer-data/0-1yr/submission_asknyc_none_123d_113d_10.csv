"Movers cancelled move in the middle of move, stole some of my belongings. Advice on next steps?


I was shocked this happened because they're a well-known company, but they operate with contractors and subcontractors, so there is room for buckpassing.

&amp;#x200B;

Two hours into my move this week, with half my belongings in their truck, my movers said ""We can't complete the move. They're going to send out another team."" They then moved all of my stuff back into my apartment!!!

&amp;#x200B;

I of course call the office who has no idea what is going on. They get the foreman to call me, but it's actually the supervisor because the foreman is one of my movers. The guy says the movers claimed something completely false (and defamatory really) as the reason why they're cancelling, which the foreman denies at first before making up another story. The supervisor says another team won't be sent out.

I saw them move an electric scooter from my apartment and into their truck. I was thankfully able to get another moving company on the same day, and they never took it from my apartment. A yellow backpack is also unaccounted for at this time.

&amp;#x200B;

The movers have denied taking it of course.

&amp;#x200B;

Anyone have any advice for next steps? I will of course be living one star reviews everywhere."
"Do you avoid sitting at home in clothes you wore while sitting on the train?


Someone posted a picture of their cat on the train and after some concern was risen about dirtiness OP said they’ll start wiping their cat’s paws after they’ve been on the train. This is what brought me to the question I’m asking. I’d incinerate my clothing after riding the train if I could afford it. Does the ‘imaginary’ dirt on the train bother you? Do you lounge around the house without issue after sitting on the train?"
"Seasonal allergies out of control?


Anyone else's allergies freaking awful right now?? We just put our AC unit in yesterday so I'm wondering if that has something to do with it, but I am DYING. Some kind of new pollen out? Am I alone in this?"
"Cool sounds in New York


So, I’m a musician and I love recording cool sounds from wherever to use in my music.  I’ve done all the obvious stuff, subway announcements, trains, horns, helicopters in FiDi, that weird recurring horn sound in Bensonhurst etc etc - so I’m looking for some more ideas.

Is there anything where you are that makes a COOL sound?  Like, a public piano or a musical art installation or a cool sounding pinball machine or some big wind chimes or SOMETHING...really interested to hear (pun intended) if anyone has any cool ideas."
"What will living on a $36,000 salary be like in NYC?


I got offered a job in upper Manhattan which I'm really excited about. The only downside is the salary which will probably be around $36,000. I'm currently living alone and I would really like to keep it that way, but I don't know if that will be possible on this salary. Should I try to look for apartments in New Jersy? I also have a car I would like to keep but I'm not planning to commute with it. Or maybe I should sell my car? 

&amp;#x200B;

Will I be squeezing by on this salary? I'm currently living in a studio apartment in Philadelphia and $36,000 a year seems reasonable here but I'm not sure about NYC.

&amp;#x200B;

Any advice from someone living on this salary in/around NYC would be greatly appreciated."
