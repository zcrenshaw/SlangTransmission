"Have any of you been paid by your landlord to move out of your apartment? Looking for tips.


I have a slumlord in a rent stabilized apartment. He is a noted predatory landlord and I'm tired of fighting with him, living in unhealthy conditions, and meeting with inspectors to force him to fix things. Right now our hallway has exposed insulation, buckled floors from water damage, ceiling leaks, and I just found a lot of mold in my apartment. This may explain why I've been sick all year.

His modus operandi is to make conditions uninhabitable so tenants will leave and he can jack up the rent.

I am considering a lawsuit but I think it may be better to just ask him to pay me to leave. What is a reasonable number to ask, and is there anything else I should know, any other tips? I also posted in the real estate sub, not sure which subs are appropriate for this kind of question,  if you think there is somewhere else I should post please let me know, thank you!"
"Severely Depressed and can't afford any mental health help


I have health insurance but it doesn't cover mental health (I have to hit my deductible) . I've been severely depressed and living off savings for a while, can barely function.  I've seen doctors in the past but hasn't really helped.  I've put off seeing any in the past year because with my current situation I really can't afford them. 

Are there any low cost solutions in NYC?"
"DYKER HEIGHTS LIGHTS


My sister is coming to the city for Christmas. We want to check out the lights in Dyker Hgts. Any recommendations for bus tours? Are they worth it. We're coming from UES. Is it walkable? Thanks for any info."
