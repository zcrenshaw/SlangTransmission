"One Million Subs


On behalf of the mod team, we wanted to [thank our subscribers](https://i.imgur.com/zc8YTsf.gifv) for making this subreddit what it is.  Because of your interest and engagement, we hit 1 million subscribers in a subreddit that started as a spinoff of another sub (including 40% of our subscribers in the last year).  To that end, we promise to keep the sub in line with its mission, free of trolls, and childish stunts.

To celebrate hitting a million subs, we would like to make two announcements.

1.     Over the test run of Casual Convo Friday, we took some input and saw what worked and what didn’t and we wanted to let everyone know that it will be a permanent feature of the sub moving forward.
2.    We are doing a community feedback survey.  For the next few weeks, [you can click HERE](https://forms.gle/xiqiLuP5irpVxEkH7) and then we will drill down the data and look at how to keep curating the community how our subscribers want.

So [thank you again](https://i.imgur.com/SUwBgIo.gifv) for joining, and participating."
