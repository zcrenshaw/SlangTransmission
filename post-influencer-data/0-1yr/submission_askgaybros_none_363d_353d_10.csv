"My brother and I are both not straight


I can’t bring myself to say “gay” about myself, so I’ll just say not straight in reference to me. But me and my brother are both not straight. We’re not twins. He’s at least 5 years older than me and out and proud. I’m closeted.

It was funny because I think I was the first person in the family to figure out that he was gay. He was downloading gay dating apps on his phone, and it showed up in the “Purchased” section of the App Store. Then, some other day, I found condoms in his car. So, being the little kid I was, I asked him about the apps and the condoms. He came out to me and I told him I was ok with it and we hugged it out. During this time, I was still unaware of my “not-straightness”.

In my middle school years, I came face to face with the fact that I didn’t really like girls. I unlocked the forbidden world of tumblr gay porn and that just cemented the fact. And that’s when my world started crumbling down. I really wish I didn’t become aware of who I was.

My mother is still very traditional. Sometime after my brother came out, we had a chat about it. My mother said she’s ok with it, but she couldn’t handle it if I were to be not straight either. She said I could never turn out like that.

I think deep down, she and my brother knows that I am not straight either. But I really don’t want to disappoint my mother. And I’ve never came out to my brother, but we were in the car once, and he said he’ll love me regardless of my preferences.

It’s been 5 years ever since I became aware of who I am. I’ve had my fair share of nights where I cried so much about this dilemma, but now, I try my best not to think about my sexual orientation. My brother’s happy with his boyfriend, which makes me very happy for him.

I’ve stumbled upon this reddit today and just felt like sharing what I felt for the longest time. I’m not looking for any advice specifically, but I just felt like I couldn’t hold this in anymore. So thank you for just reading this "
"I cannot STAND it when straight men go into gay bars and then complain about being hit on.


 If you don't want to be hit on or offered sexual advances by another guy then get out of our space! First of all gay bars are a place for gay men to go to associate and find partners. You going in there and leading gay men on into thinking they have a chance  is a pretty asshole move but then to also complain about getting hit on and being offered sexual advances is the stupidest thing ever.

""How dare you assume I'm gay when we're both in a GAY bar!"" Give me a fucking break.

"Boyfriend earns a lot more than me..and I have to tell him I can't live his lifestyle anymore


My boyfriend is 37, he works at a big firm, earns a lot. On our first date, he told me that he doesn't like being a ""sugar daddy"". I thought that's fine, but I am 22, working at an entry level job, struggling to save money. He keeps asking me to go out on drinks. And now he even booked a resort for a weekend getaway. I can't afford all of this! How do I tell him? I mean. Even though it's expensive, we really have fun together wherever he takes me. He has an idea about his lifestyle, which I don't, I can't, I don't have money for it. How do I honestly just tell him that I don't want him to be a sugar daddy, but I also cannot sustain his lifestyle either.. Talks about money always embarrass me. I don't wanna be that person who is whiny about money, but I don't have a lot of it..would like your thoughts on this please "
"Just got ghosted for suggesting condoms.


Back in April i met a guy who wanted to hook up right away. I was horny and he was hot so i thought why not, the only thing is he insisted on no condoms and said it felt better. Being young, dumb and horny is said let’s do it. 

We had sex 4-5 within a month. He then texts me and says that he has chlamydia and that i should get tested. I thanked him for his honesty and got tested, i didn’t catch any STD. 

Fast forward over a month later i text him and ask if he wants to hook up again, and he was down to hook up until i mentioned condoms. He then blocks me, lol. 

The thing is i know this guy fucks around like crazy, because i once forgot my glasses at his apartment. I went back to his apartment and on the way down the stairs i see a guy on his way up. When i asked about that guy later he said that that’s his fwb, lol. Not only that he has a gf and a newborn baby. "

"Nephew told us he was gay, looking for advice and insight?


First off, hi to everyone reading. I apologize in advance if this is the wrong place for me to ask this question and if I’ve made any mistakes in my writing or wording (my English has been getting a little rusty). I found this subreddit from an online article about someone in a similar position I feel that maybe gay men could provide some valuable insight or experience as to this situation.

I’m a 38-year-old man living with my amazing wife of the same age, that I’ve known practically since kindergarten. We have a 2-year-old baby daughter together and we are also raising my brother-in-law’s 10-year-old boy, let’s call him Robert (not the child’s real name, of course). We took Robert in when he was four, after a tragic drowning took my brother-in-law’s life. The boy’s mother raising him was out of the question, as she was an alcoholic who hadn’t been in contact with the family for three years. It wasn’t much of a debate between my wife and I: we knew that we were ready and in a stable position to take Robert in and that we had an obligation towards her brother in any event, as he would have had towards her. So, we opened our home to Robert and gave him our unconditional love, as we would have if he was our biological child.

The reason I’m writing this here today is because my wife and I believe our nephew might be gay. Actually, we are pretty convinced, because he more or less said it himself. But let me elaborate.

Growing up, I guess Robert has always been a little “softer” in his manners compared to other boys, but I don’t believe much in stereotypes; I mean, I myself grew up with three sisters and we played with dolls and dresses all the time, and I’m still very much a straight man. My wife and I never restricted him in how he wanted to play or express himself. The question of being gay never really came up until Robert was about 6. We were all sitting on the couch and flipping through a clothes catalogue. My wife was looking at the kids’ section and asking Robert if he liked this or that but he was impatient and kept wanting to flip it towards the end, which was the men’s section. I joked that he might be six and a half but those clothes were still too big for him and he told me, very frankly: “I don’t want clothes, I want to look at the boys.” Wife and I were taken aback and I don’t think we even said anything, but he soon lost interest anyway and left to play.

We later talked about it and concluded it might just be an unimportant comment, but even if it turned out to be more, we would still love him all the same. However, this did make us look at our parenting from a bit of a different angle and we made an effort to let Robert know it was okay to have feelings for either girls or boys. My wife has a male friend from college that’s now married to another man (technically, domestic partnership in our country) and she explained it to Robert, how weddings didn’t have to be just between boys and girls. He took in what we told him, or so I hope, but as he didn’t make any comments like the one from before for a while, this faded from out minds.

In fact, the topic didn’t come up again until a few days ago. I was away on a business trip and my wife first told me about it over the phone. She gave our daughter her bottle and put her in bed and went to tuck Robert in, as usual. They talked a bit about school, nothing really that significant, but he then caught her off-guard by asking something along the lines of, “Does ‘gay’ mean that two boys are together?” She confirmed that it did, as we’d already told him when he was younger (I don’t know how much of that he took in after all). He then asked her what would happen if he was gay. Of course, my wife told him that nothing would change, he would still be the amazing and smart boy he’s always been and we would love him unconditionally. She tried to prompt him to say why he asked or if there was a boy that he liked, but he just started crying after that, and I’m really mad that I wasn’t there to support him and my wife because I know it was difficult on her own. He was very upset and told her that a girl from his school said that gay people die and go to hell. I don’t know much about this girl except that her parents seem to be quite nationalist, from what I’ve seen on Facebook. Robert was baptized by his father’s decision and while my wife and I aren’t very religious (we only go to mass on major holidays), we put him in RE class when he started school because most of his friends attend it and we didn’t want him to feel left out.

I returned from my trip the following day and we decided to talk to Robert together after dinner. My wife tried to be collected but I could tell she was as worried as I was. She’d assured Robert that what the girl said was nonsense and that there was nothing wrong with being gay, but although he’d stopped crying, she could tell that he was still troubled and he woke up that morning with a stomachache (this only happens when he’s under stress). In the evening, we put a cartoon on for our daughter and tried to ease into the conversation with Robert. I told him that Aunt said how he was a little sad yesterday. I tried to mention this as nonchalantly as I could but he just broke into tears again. I got really worried at this point and I held him to calm him down, I wished nothing more than to take his pain away just like that. He cried about how he didn’t want to be evil and go to hell and my wife had to leave the room for a while because she was on the verge of tears herself. I repeated to him everything my wife and I had already said – that there was nothing wrong with liking boys, that gay people didn’t go to hell and they weren’t evil, and that anyone who told him different was ignorant and did not know what they were talking about. I mentioned to him my wife’s friend and his husband, both of whom he knew, and asked him if he thought they were evil. He said no and I managed to slowly calm him down after that. I left Robert with my wife who was able to compose herself and left to put our daughter to bed, because she was getting curious about the commotion in the kitchen and I didn’t want her to get upset as well.

Afterwards, the three of us sat down in the living room together and we talked, probably for over an hour. Well, my wife and I did most of the talking, although we tried to bring Robert into the conversation, but he didn’t say much. However, I could tell that he was more relaxed and listened to us. We hadn’t planned a speech, exactly, so it ended up being all over the place, about gay people, homophobia, marriage, family and friends – we tried our best to put it in the words understandable to a 10-year-old. I didn’t want to overwhelm him, but I wanted to make sure that he really understood this time, in no uncertain terms, that it was more than okay if he was gay and that he could talk to us about that or anything else that was on his mind. In the end, he seemed a lot calmer and said that he’d like to have a boyfriend when he was grown up. We told him that was great and that anyone would be lucky to have him as a boyfriend. I could tell that he was shy about it so I didn’t push any further and it was getting way too late for a school night, anyway.

I’m sorry for the length of this post, I tried to describe the situation the best that I could. My wife and I talked more that night and decided we would talk to the school psychologist about the situation and what was said to Robert (I don’t want him exposed to that kind of speech again) and ask for her advice on how to proceed. I’m really worried now, however, because I realize I can’t protect him from hateful ideas in any given situation – not even at school, where most parents believe their child is in a safe environment. I find myself double-guessing our parenting thus far, wondering if we could’ve made more effort to make sure he knew and understood it was okay to like boys, if we made a mistake putting him in the RE class (I’m seriously considering signing him out – I don’t want him to feel left out, but I’m afraid of what he might hear there). My wife mentioned that she could invite her friend and his husband over for dinner and they could talk to Robert, which I feel might be good, for him to see and talk to a happy gay couple.

Obviously, however, my wife and I aren’t gay, and we have no experience raising a child who might be LGBT. This is why I wanted to ask for advice from the people who likely had more practical insight into this. If there is something that we omitted to do, that we didn’t think about and that could be significant for Robert growing up. We want him to feel loved and protect him as much as we can, but I admit I’m really a fish out of water here. And I certainly don’t want to do something at this stage that could provoke more damage than good in the long run.

Thank you for reading this essay of a question and thanks in advance for any opinions you might be able to provide."
"Being gay is a blessing and a curse


One of my friends got evicted and has been staying with me for a month or so

It started out he was just gonna sleep on my couch for a bit until he could save up some money. Told him he could stay as long as he needs. 

He's been a bit down on his luck this past year. His mom died, he lost his job, got a new job, lost that job, finally got another job, then got evicted.

Anyway so my couch is pretty uncomfortable to sleep on daily, and one night we were chilling in my room on my bed and he fell asleep. I'm gay, he's straight, and I guess I didn't wanna make shit weird so I slept on the couch that night even though my bed is a king.

Next day he made a comment about how nice my bed is and I knew he didn't like sleeping on my couch because I hate sleeping on it too so I told him he could sleep in my bed and we could put up some barrier or some shit if that was too gay for him. I said that mostly as a joke anyways but he said it was cool he didn't care.

So now my hot straight friend is sleeping in my bed in just his boxers every night. 

On one hand, I feel really lucky.

He moves a lot in his sleep and he's ended up with his arm over me once or twice and I've had the AC on for the summer so sometimes he gets cold and kinda snuggles up to me. I don't even think he realizes it but I can't help but get a fuckin boner every time. I came out a bit later than other people my age nowadays so I haven't been with that many dudes

But yeah I feel kinda pervy for even checking him out. Does he have to basically cuddle me too so that I get a boner every other night? I feel gross for it. And my mouth actually waters sometimes looking at him lmfao is that even normal? Has this happened to anyone else?

And I know he's straight and nothing will ever happen. I get it. 

But it's like holding a huge ass cake in front of a fat kid and then eating the whole fucking cake, slowly, in front of him while you brag how fucking good it was. 

*Sigh*"
"BERT &amp; ERNIE creator being attacked for saying they aren’t gay


As gay men, this shit need to stop. If you don’t know: someone who worked on Sesame Street said BERT and ERNIE were gay in his mind, but the creators denied it. 

The creator wrote the character as NOT gay but now gay people on Twitter are saying HIS idea doesn’t matter because they want them to be gay so they should. When he objected, they called him homophobic and are saying he must hate gays. This peak PC-Gay agenda culture at its finest and it makes us look bad. Thoughts? Done. "
"Coworker came in tonight showing off her new boyfriend. Trying to make me jealous.


So I have a coworker who was into me (Apparently still is). She came in tonight with her new boyfriend and made a point of introducing him to me and talking about how hot he is and muscled and gorgeous. She even hinted that he has a huge cock. There a just one problem here. 

I've slept with him and he's closeted as fuck. He was very awkward when she introduced us and had this look like a deer in the headlights. I'm not going to our him or anything, that's none of my business but I see this becoming an annoyance if she's going to start bringing him in all of the time trying to make me jealous. Especially with all of his macho guy posturing while they walked through the store. 

My first thought is to just ignore it. I don't mess with coworkers because I don't like drama in the work place but she seems intent on creating some. What would you bros do in my situation? 
I'm not going to out the guy but if this becomes a problem in the coming days I'd like outside perspectives."

Been seeing this guy lately and we havent done anything. 

We just make out, cuddle, make out while cuddling and lay in bed together. Idk why but its way more arousing for me.

"A sweet guy told me I was beautiful at work today.


Thought I'd share a positive experience.  I recently lost a lot of weight but still see myself as unattractive, and a work in progress.

Today at work, a (really cute) guy stopped by my desk and said ""You probably already know this, but you're beautiful.""  Then he told me I have nice eyes.

This is the first time in my entire life someone who isn't my mom has told me that.  I honestly had to excuse myself because I started shaking.  I'm still processing.  Wow.  Just wow.

You all are beautiful and I hope you have a beautiful afternoon.  "
"Went to a little gay house party yesterday!


I feel like a lot of posts here are about major steps in relationships or things like that. I just wanted to say that yesterday I went to a university party, and there happened to be a couple of other gay guys there! Kind of like, a bunch of girls and gays.

I didn’t hook up and I don’t really think anyone else did. But me and the other gay guys had a lot of things in common! Things like music and memes and dancing to music! I didn’t need to constantly be in “hookup mode” and it was just nice making new friends and absorbing that positive energy. And drinking a little bit. 

It’s kind of new for me just because I haven’t really been able to meet gay guys out of a more sexualized context (dating apps). And I can be anxious around gay public spaces like clubs or events. So I just wanted to share my good vibes here! "
"Survey: How many of you thought ""I'm not gay, I don't like men, I just like dick"" at some point when you were younger?


I thought it back in high school. I know some gay/bi friends who thought it too. And I have seen the same phrase expressed pretty frequently on message boards or even this subreddit.

I get the mentality, I really do. We want so badly to be straight and normal that we ignore common sense: guys that are 100% straight would never be turned on by dicks. We even try to argue that you can somehow separate the male anatomy from the rest of the male!

How many of you guys also went through this phase?"
"Anybody else ever get hit by a huge wave of depression related to being gay?


I assume its a form of internalized homophobia, being raised very conservatively and religiously. I spent such a long time self loathing because of it, and I guess that shit doesn't leave you overnight. I start thinking about how most others hate us, are disgusted by us, how we could be the target of an attack because they find out we are gay, that there is some possibility of god and going to hell because of it, that Im just a freak really. I get these thoughts and then start getting suicidal. No matter how much better things are I get these feelings some days. I have anxiety problems that make it worse too, focusing on the hypothetical problems that could arrise. It gets unbearable some days and I cant do anything except focus on these fears.

Has anyone improved with this? My main solution is my bf, but I feel like it wears at him even. Ive done all the doctor shit for years and it never got me anywhere. Sometimes I think the only way is to live on some remote uncharted island where all of these socially and culturally driven constraints just dont exist."
