"Its my fault a customer doesn't understand the concept of time


For some background I currently work in a jewelry store that is most known for its swan logo. A customer comes in and requests to put a certain necklace on hold. I inform her I can only put it on hold for 48 hours and that at the end of the day on March 24 the item will put back out and no longer on hold. She agrees, thanks me, and leaves. Fast-forward to April 3, she comes back and the conversation is as follows, she'll be C and I'll be Me.

&amp;#x200B;

C: Hello there! Do you remember me? You put that necklace on hold for me

Me: Yes! I remember you, unfortunately that was the last necklace of that style we had in stock and someone bought it yesterday. I can take your information and order one for you but as I said before it can take up to 4-6 weeks. If you'd like to walk around the store I can help you find something else you like.

C: What?! I SPECIFICALLY told you to hold it for me!!

Me: Yes, and I did. But as I previously informed you we can only hold items for 48 hours and at the end of the day on March 24 the item was put back out.

C: WHY!? Its MY ITEM!

Me: Ma'am, you never paid for the item so it isn't your property. At the end of the hold period it was put back out. Would you like me to order another one for you? I just need your name and a way to contact you once it arrives.

C: No! Its mine! Why did you put it back out? I came right back!

Me: The last day of the hold was March 24, its now April 3. Our policy is to only hold items for 48 hours. Would you like to take a look around and perhaps find something else you like?

C: I came RIGHT BACK! Where is it?! Let me talk to your manager! 

\~At this point she screams at the manager for half an hour, she insists she came right back even though its been well over a week. She demands to be given compensation for the necklace and swiftly gets put in her place by the manager.\~

C: FINE. Since no one here plans to honour an agreement with a customer I'll never be shopping here again!

Me: \*under my breath\* You never shopped here in the first place.

"""So you're going to go dumpster diving then?"" -customer my husband dealt with today.


My husband works in cell phones. He's a manager. 

They had a customer come in and buy a new phone and had one of those phone cases with a wallet built in to the back where he kept his driver's license/credit cards,etc. 

A day after he leaves he calls and tells my husband he can't find his phone case with his info and needs them to look for it.

My husband asked his employee who worked with him if she had seen it. She said she distinctly remembered putting it in the bag with his other things. 

Husband tells customer this and this what happened. C-customer H-husband 

C: well your employee is WRONG. Because it's not here! It must have gotten thrown away! 

H: we have a very loyal cleaning crew who empties the trash every night sir. They would have seen it, if it had. 

C: THERES JUST NO WAY! It has to be there! It can literally not be anywhere else. 

H: well we have the dumpsters out back so if it was in the trash that is where it would be. 

C: So how long will it take you to dig in the dumpster to find it?

H:...... You want me to dumpster dive for a phone case that wasn't thrown away?

C: YES! THIS IS YOUR RESPONSIBILITY. 

H: We share a dumpster with 3 food establishments and one hair salon. I will not be taking any of my time to dig through that. You can feel free. You know where we're located. 

The customer told him to fuck off and that he was a disgrace to his company. 
My husband laughed and told him that he hoped the rest of his day was as pleasant as he was.

"Only a kid would think like this...


I'm a first time poster, so please be gentle.

I'm a volunteer at a charity shop, and I spend a lot of my time at the front with the customers. This means that I see a lot of people, and come across all sorts.

During a quiet period, a young boy - probably 6 or 7 years old - came into the shop, accompanied by a woman whom I assumed was his grandmother. They looked around for a while before coming up to the counter, where we have a small display of 'Knitted Chicks.' These chicks are, as the name suggest, knitted chicks in a variety of colours; the bonus is that they contain a chocolate egg as a treat.

The boy sees them, and then the following conversation takes place:

&amp;#x200B;

Boy: I like the look of these.

Woman: Oh, they're pretty; look, there's even an egg inside.

Boy: I think I'll get one. *(addressing me)* How do I get the egg out?

*(I pick up one of the chicks.)*

Me: You cut along this thread here; it's separate from the rest of the chick, so it won't unravel.

(The boy is silent for a moment.)

Boy: I've changed my mind about getting one.

Woman: Why's that?

Boy: Well... I don't want to kill the chick to get the egg.

&amp;#x200B;

At this point, I had to stop myself from bursting out laughing - professional demeanour and all that - while the woman attempts to convince the boy that the chick 'will be all right.' He's not convinced, and they both leave without purchasing anything. As soon as they were out of sight, I laughed so hard I had a coughing fit.

Anyway, that's my first post; a bit tame compared to some of the other stuff I've seen, but it got a laugh out of me and the Manager (when I told her about it), so I thought I'd share it here.

I've got other stories as well, so perhaps I'll share them at some point in the future."
"12 Items or Less


As promised in my last post, the story of Roid Rager from the early 90s. Strap in or head for the tl;dr

RR: Roid Rager. You know the type. Huge. Twitchy. Lived in the gym. 

GF: Roid Rager's trashy girlfriend who still had an 80s perm.

OP: Teenage grocery store cashier.

AM: Middle-aged manager who had handled many a Florida Man.

Unfortunately I was on the express lane that day. We'd gotten word blasted down from national that secret shoppers reported people in the express lane with big orders. It was a valid complaint. They weren't putting enough cashiers on due to a cost cutting measure instituted by the regional director, so lines were ridiculous. We'd been taking them on express when it was empty. Regardless, now we had strict instructions no more than 20 items in the 12 or less lane. It could get you written up and hurt your raises or even result in termination if you got 3 inside some time period I forget.

The cashiers were responsible for keeping the register candy and magazines stocked and neat. Also the front of store displays between the last register and produce. Those were the weekly big sale items and this giant cardboard Kool-Aid monstrosity of doom that contained thousands of packets of heavily dyed citric acid and artificial flavor. Many a kid trashed that thing. It was the bane of our existence. So was the nightly fronting of the baby food aisle, but that's not relevant to this story. I just like to whine about fronting baby food. Those little jars were evil.

RR, GF and his very full cart hop in my express lane line while an elderly lady is just finishing up her transaction. GF's whining to RR about the wait. She wants to go somewhere else. This is boring. He started telling her to shut up. They got into a mild spat instead of putting things on the belt, so I let them be to finish the elderly lady's transaction.

When I was with her, RR snapped at his GF something about how they're checking out now and to stop being a bitch. 

As kindly as possible, I pointed out the 12 items or less sign and explained I wasn't permitted to check out anybody with more than a few over. Manager's orders. There were lanes open down the way. 

RR leaned over the counter at me, informed me loudly that he didn't have time to wait and listen to GF bitch, and I would be checking him out immediately or else. I hit my panic button and flipped on my register light. That automatically called the police and set off silent alarms in all the back areas of the store.

He started slamming down his things on the belt as I attempted to explain that I had called a manager, but I could not ring up his things without approval. I could literally get fired for it. There had been complaints. That's when RR started to really lose it. Informed me quite loudly that he had a complaint too. Was his complaint less important than anybody else's? This went on with my parentage being called into question and stuff slamming on the counter so hard a couple things even opened. 

AM arrived running up from the back where he'd been dealing with a delivery issue. AM was not a small man, but RR was freaking huge. AM told me to go in his office (up half a level with half-walls where you can see all the registers easy), he'd handle this. I fled. RR did not take that well. RR demanded that the c-word ring him up, not some pencil neck suit.

My manager was quite firm that nobody would be ringing him up, and asked him to leave. RR lost it completely and started swearing, arm waving and knocking magazines off the display. The GF did not even cower at this like you'd think. She started whining about how long they'd already been there and how she didn't want to do it all again. RR yelled something about being done with all this, then he gave the still mostly-full cart a mighty shove. It went careening down towards produce and straight into the giant Kool-Aid display knocking the entire thing over and scattering hundreds of packets of kool-aid across all of produce.

RR physically dragged GF out by the arm, and we never saw them again. About fifteen minutes later the cops showed up. Nice job on that panic button, guys. They took our reports and security footage, but nobody knew his name or anything useful. The parking lot cameras had bad coverage and hadn't seen anything helpful either.

That was the one and only time I ever cried at work. It was terrifying. I was also closing. That display was my job to fix before I clocked out for the night. AM helped me as did most of the rest of the staff once they were done with their areas, but it was a good hour and a half putting back together the cardboard display (which was a dented mess) and sorting hundreds and hundreds of kool-aid packets back into their correct slots. Then I still had to front the baby food (they helped with that too).

By the next week AM had told the district manager to pound sand and started putting enough cashiers on shifts. 

tl;dr: Steroid-infused gym rat flips out at being told he can't take a full cart through the express lane and hurls his cart into a giant display of Kool-Aid packets. OP had to fix it."
