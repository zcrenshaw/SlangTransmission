"I was robbed at gunpoint lastnight.


It was 9:55PM, and the store was minutes from closing. I was stocking the bread per my managers request. Store was empty.

I don’t really know why, I just suddenly started leaving the bread aisle and walking towards the front of the store (where the registers are). Looking back, I think I heard my manager say something, and I figured there was a customer to ring up.

Suddenly I see 3 men in hoodies, masks, one of them has a silver gun. I actually didn’t look closely at whether all of them were wearing masks - I saw the silver gun and the black clothes and knew what was going on. My manager was being roughly thrown to the ground under the registers (where the vault is).

They see me exit the bread aisle and begin shouting, I think one of them yelled “come on bitch” while pointing the gun at me. There was a ton of nervousness and urgency in their voices, a lot of “come ON lets GO”. 

I just immediately went emotionally and physically numb. My only thought was “this is actually happening”. 

One of them rushed to me, put his hand on my shoulder, and walked me to the registers where my manager already was.

They were shouting at me to open the register, which I could not do without a key. They had a gun on me and were screaming at me to “open it! OPEN it”. I tried but for some reason it kept saying I was already signed in on another register and honestly I couldn’t open anything (sales associates are useless in a robbery FYI future robbers).

I kept my hands up, but near my face. I never looked at any of them once they walked me to the register. I made no statements the entire time, and never engaged any of them. The focus of the robbers quickly was diverted to my manager when they realized he held the keys and was the only one who could help them. They were shouting at him, pointing guns, etc.

Suddenly the vault popped open. They hit the register as well, which took several seconds to open because my manager’s hand was shaking too much. 

Once they got the money - and this all took maybe 2 minutes total - I became terrified. I had this horrible preparedness to take a bullet to my head any second. I knew some robbers shoot the cashiers once they get the cash. 

The robbers all seemed very panicky, and two of them were continually yelling “lets go lets go man!” To the third guy. The third guy was insistent on opening the register AFTER they already hit the vault, which the other two were panicking about. They were waiting at the door freaking out. The panicky vibe made me more nervous, in a way. 

But just like that, it was over. They ran out. My manager locked the door. A customer, a young woman, had walked in during the robbery and they took her purse. She was in the store with us after it happened. She was crying and very shaken. I just hugged her and didn’t know what to say, but I said something about “we’re OK”.

This is the next morning, I don’t work today. Not really sure I want to close anymore."
"Yes we do heal Pokemon here


Dont know if this truely belongs here but idk where else to put it. Im a dog groomer, last year we had a picture of one of the former groomers standing next to a gastly from pokemon go that appeared to be on a grooming table. It was hanging up with tons of other pictures of dogs.  


Well one day a father and his 2 sons come in to pick up their dog. The dad says his youngest son has a question. The little boy was too shy to speak so the dad asks for him if we heal pokemon and points to the picture. The dad is winking at me and the son has a pokeball with a little charmander plush inside. I said oh yeah, just give me a few minutes and I'll get him all fixed up for you.  


I just took him to the back and turned on the dryer for a few seconds all the while the bather was looking at me questioningly and i quickly explained what i was doing. She started crying it was so sweet and innocent.   


I turned off the dryer and took him back out front and said here you go all healed. They said thankyou and left.   


Just a short sweet wholesome story for you guys."
"I did you a favor and you forced me to take it back.


one time at work (I was maybe a few months into the job) I was getting murdered by this long line and I was beep beep beeping everyone’s items the fastest I could. I noticed however when I was bagging this lady’s stuff that I didn’t ring her up for one of the shirts she bought. 😱 I thought for a second and said “FUCK IT” (in my head of course) and I just gave her the shirt. She was kind of a bitch so I wasn’t trying to deal with her any longer. anyways I finish the line quickly and about an hour passes and this lady come back 🤔 and looking very pissed off too. “Hi anything I can help you with?” I ask. She tells me “yeah you charged me wrong 😠” .......... “this idiot” I think in my head. “Okay can I see your items and your receipt?” I tell her. And she laid all her items out and puts the receipt in my face saying I overcharged her for a shirt she bought. I go over the receipt with her item by item and she just saw a $29 jean sign over the shirt she bought and assumed it applied to the shirt on the wall as well even tho is SAYS JEANS. Anyways I burst her bubble and tell her “these were all the items you bought correct?” She hits me with “yeah you charged me did you already forget that?” I tell her “well imma have to apologize but it looks like I missed one of the items when I was ringing you up and I’m gonna have to do that before I let you leave the store with it again or it would be considered stealing.” BOY IF YOU SAW THE LOOK ON THIS LADYS FACE AS I CENSORED HER SHIRT AND WAITED FOR HER RESPONSE!!! Anyways she just gives me an “oh” and I rung her up for the $50 shirt and she went on her way."
