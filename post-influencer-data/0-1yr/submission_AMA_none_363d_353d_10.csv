"My mom took me from my dad when I was 4, telling me that he molested me and might try to kidnap me. I was terrified of him my whole life. I found out she lied to me when I was 37. AMA!


When I was 4, my mom took me from my biological dad.  She told me that he molested me (she said I told her what he did, but I have no memory of that).  She warned me that he and his friends might try to kidnap me from preschool or elementary school, or plant spies to watch me.  As I grew older, the stories about him grew more graphic and specific.  
My mom died when I was 27.
10 years later I found some evidence that my mom may have lied... or may have been crazy... or both.  I started asking questions, and came to the conclusion that my dad was most likely a good guy.  Emailing him, and then finally meeting him, was the hardest, and scariest thing I've ever had to do.
Good news:  I have an awesome dad.  Bad news:  I had to learn my mom was a sociopath and a liar, and that my childhood was a lie.

"I am a Mortician/Embalmer and Body Remover for sudden deaths, suicides, homicides, and motor accidents - AMA


Hello! I am a Canadian Embalmer/Mortician (Funeral Director) who, upon a temporary shift of my scope of practice, also works as a body remover for a body removal company that deals with all sudden deaths including (but not limited to) suicides, homicides, and motor vehicle accidents.

As a result, not only do I have the license and knowledge to embalm a body and direct a funeral; I have also seen the aftermath of horrifying scenarios. Some perplexing, some downright horrifying.

Death is something that eludes many people, and there should always be a safe place where it can be discussed in an educational and cathartic or psychologically comforting manner. It happens to everyone, and curiosity over something so profound is natural. Feel free to ask me anything.

Lastly, I am bound by professionalism and confidentiality so I will not give out any names or information that would allow someone to say “hey I know that person” or “where did that take place”. I am aiming to answer questions about being a mortician and the topic of death in a healthy manner."
