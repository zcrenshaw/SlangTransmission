"I don’t have a dad and it used to be okay, but now I need one. How do I get through growing up without a dad or any male role models? (13m)


I’m 13 m and I’ve never known my dad. I haven’t started puberty yet but I know I’m gonna soon and I’m nervous.
I don’t have anyone to talk to about it, and it’s starting to make me sad.

Also my mom doesn’t like sports but I do, and she’s letting me play them, but I don’t have anyone to help teach me at home. This is just a little thing, but it kinda bugs me.

Plus I have questions and problems and stuff that I don’t want to talk to my mom about at all. Idk what to do.

Did any of you grow up with no dad? What should I do?"

"MOD POST: Self-pitying validation comments will result in a temp ban


Sup shitlords,

While we understand that you all have terrible self-esteem and don't think you'll ever get laid/will never find a partner/insert any other delusional self-hating fantasy here, but honestly this sub is not the place for your pity party.  Posting that crap is obviously attention-seeking behavior and we're not here to encourage it any more.  So we've decided to start handing out temp bans for anyone who wants to turn this sub into their own pity party.  This is applicable for both posts and comments.  

For example, these comments in response to the post ""What does your ideal SO look like"":

&gt; She exists

LMAO WE GET IT BECAUSE YOU'RE SO LONELY AN EXISTENT GIRLFRIEND IS SUFFICIENT ROFLMAO

&gt; my hand

HOLY SHIT WHAT A FUCKING COMEDIAN HERE PROEJCTING YOUR OWN INSECURITIES ONTO THIS POST SO ORIGINAL

&gt; literally anybody

OMFG WAOW SO TORTURED AND LONELY TAKE ME NOW RANDOM COMMENTER

Look everyone has their own insecurities and joking about them is fine but if the only thing you are going to offer to a post is non-answers specifically designed to make people feel bad because you are lacking in some way, then not only are you not contributing to the conversation, you're trying to push your own agenda of seeking validation.  Which is against the rules.

First offense: 3 day ban

Second offense: 7 day ban

Third offense: perma ban

And for those of you who were wondering ""why couldn't the mods have just implemented this and not told anyone about it"", it's because we need attention and want you all to notice us.

**tl;dr bans for self-pitying attention-seeking comments**

~~Go fuck yourselves~~ Love,

The mods"

"Why do women seem to talk more about their sex lives in detail with their friends then men do?


My Fiance talks in detail about our sex life to her friends, and I don't really care, but it is kind of awkward talking to them knowing what they know about me. I guess I just don't get why they do this. Most girls I've dated have said they do this. In my experience none of my guy friends talk in detail about their sex lifes. I couldn't imagine wanting to explain what my finances vagina looks like to my friends, but they have no problem telling their friends all about their bfs penis. Is this something else other guys experience, or is it just circumstantial?"
"What is an appropriate response when a guy offers to pay for my drink/meal?


Evening fellas. I have a date upcoming! I’m really excited but of course I’m nervous, too. 

I have been on my fair share of dates. One thing I can’t seem to nail, or make it not seem awkward every time, is when the bill comes and he quickly hands a card without me even having a say. 

This is fine, I think it’s chivalrous, but I don’t know how to respond. Do I act like I expected them to pay for it? Or do I act surprised? I don’t want to be rude during this process, and there have been times I’ve paid my half and that’s been more than ok with me. I just purely want to know how you all would expect a woman to react when you pay for her on a date, and what an appropriate response to that would be.

Right now, my process is kind of like this: say something along the lines of “oh you don’t have to do that” (because they don’t), ask if they are ok with paying, then say thank you if they are ok with it. 

I know it sounds dumb. I just like this guy a lot and want things to go smoothly. Thanks in advance!"
"When is the best time to tell people I'm 4'10 on online dating and why?


Hi. 

So I'm from the UK and wanted some advice. I'm 19 and 4'10 and done growing. My proportions are also normal. As you can probably imagine it's not easy for me dating at my size so I am considering setting up a dating profile. 

Are there specific apps I should use where people are less likely fo judge me for my size? 

Should I list my height on my profile? If I dont list it then people will be shocked irl and wont like it, but if I  do put it kn then I wont get any matches?

Thanks."

Last night I told a girl that was rubbing on my leg “My dick isn’t THAT big”
I was referring to the fact that she was rubbing where my knees were, but I don’t think she put two and two together and basically just thought I admitted to having a really small dick. 
Anyhow, let’s all make each other feel better and see who can top who."

I broke up with my ex a few months ago and she gave the best fucking cuddles. Occasionally, I'll experience these deep feelings of withdrawal. I've never been addicted to drugs, but that's the closest thing I can compare it to. Just deep, painful, incessant need for cuddles.

"How trustworthy do you find this sub?


So just based on my history you can tell that I like to frequent this sub, but I while I do enjoy interacting here I just find that I feel like I am getting a narrow view of the world here. I feel like a lot of the perspectives presented here are from men in their 20s and 30s who are into nerdy hobbies and likely had issues being accepted by their peers as a teenager. I don't mean any disrespect as that pretty much describes myself, but I orginally came to this sub to try to improve myself. However I pretty much just switched to largely coming for entertainment as it seemed like getting advice from people who felt very similar to myself just wouldn't challenge my preconceptions enough for any meaningful personal change. Anyways what are your guy's opinions? Feel free to call bullshit on anything I said if that's what you think."

"Boyfriend got let go from his favorite job ever, what can I do to keep him motivated and help him?


As title says, he just got let go from one of his favorite jobs he’s had in the past 5 years. He was still in his first 6 months of probation , and they said his performance was not improving . I lowkey think the company was right.


He recently paid off a huge credit card debt so his savings are a bit tight... and now he is super bummed our summer plans are on a halt


What can I do to help him? I am quite controlling when it comes to normal day to day stuff , likes to plan and help in a mom way but I am thinking I need to roll it back to let him do his own thing..


TL;DR boyfriend is bummed out summer plans needs to be cancelled because savings are tight after job less, how can I help him feel better?"

"Men of askmen, what was your most toxic relationship?


I'm almost in my mid 30s, i've dated a lot, met a lot of people, been in bad relationships, been in amazing ones, i've met people from all corners of the world, and have fallen in love plenty of times. 

But i can say without a doubt that my relationship i ended today was the absolute most toxic relationship i have ever experienced. Things happened to me that i never thought would happen, things that i read about and i laughed at before because it was so ridiculous because i felt like i would never fall into that trap.

In the end, all i wanted was for her to take a small amount of responsibility for her actions, for her to just own up to her mistakes. But even at the very end, with no way to save our relationship, she wanted to shift the blame on me.

I just want to say to anyone reading this, that just because she was the one with tears in her eyes at the end, doesn't mean that she was right.

So men, what was your most toxic relationship, what signs did you miss, where did it all go wrong?"
