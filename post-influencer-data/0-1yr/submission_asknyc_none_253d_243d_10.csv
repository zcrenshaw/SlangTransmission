"""Unusual"" foods and where to try them?


I put ""unusual"" in quotes because it's pretty relative, but one of the main advantages to living in NYC for me is being able to try just about any food from anywhere in the world. Lately I've done cheese tea (which is amazing) and ackee (which is more of an acquired taste but also amazing), and my next 3 are yak butter tea, kaya toast, and haggis. Problem is I've eaten my way through a lot of the omnivore's hundred and I'm starting to run out of ideas. It feesl like I'm reaching the end of a road unless I can find a place to get balut stateside, but I'm pretty sure that's not actually the case and there's plenty of things out there I'm just not thinking of. Do you have any suggestions for somebody with a particularly adventurous palate?"
"Have you ever had bed bugs?


Anyone else have to deal with these bullshit little guys? I had them a few months ago and was able to take them out myself without an exterminator (it was a relatively small infestation, and surprisingly easy to deal with, having heard the horror stories), but I've heard of others who get stuck with them for ages. Curious as to how widespread they are across the city, and where (I'm in Astoria). "
"Internship Housing


Hey guys,

I’m looking for summer internship housing near the financial district for me and two other friends. I was wondering for those of you who have interned in the summer, what’s the best way to find a place for three months? I’ve been looking in lower Manhattan and Brooklyn Heights but haven’t found anything too great. Budget is around $4000 a month, give or take.
I’m a fellow New Yorker myself but I live too far from manhattan to feasibly commute early in the morning since this is a finance internship.

Thank you!"
"My friend from home is here and I don’t know what we should do


I moved to Brooklyn two months ago. I have a friend from home visiting for the weekend and I don’t know what we should do. I haven’t been here long enough to know a lot of fun activities to do/places to go. Please send in your recommendations, anywhere in the city is fine but preferably Manhattan/Brooklyn. Thanks!!"
