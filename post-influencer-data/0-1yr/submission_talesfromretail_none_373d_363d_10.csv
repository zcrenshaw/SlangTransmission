"My Kid has seen it so they deserve it!! Yours isn't even here?!


So this is a story from a few years ago, at Christmas of course, first time poster long time lurker.

 We can refer to the ""woman"" as W and the male customer as M.

I was working in the toy aisle minding my own business stacking Hatchimals, when a screech erupted from behind me.

W - Put that down!! I saw it first how dare you pick that up!!

M - Sorry? 

W - My son wants that toy put it down!!

M - Umm I'm sorry I picked it up before you even got here? My son wants it as well.

W - Yes well your son isn't here is he?! My son is and has seen the toy already!! You can just tell yours it wasn't here can't you!?

She is legitimately yelling every word at this guy and a few customers have gathered to watch the event.

M - Well I didn't bring my son because it's his Christmas present?

W - Oh and you assume it isn't my son's as well!?

The kids about 8 years old and doesn't look bothered at all, this must be usual business for the mother. The man is stunned just staring at her before slowly turning to me obviously looking for help. Before I can open my mouth...

W - Don't look for him to help they're f*ckin useless here!!

Well there goes even the slightest chance of me pretending to look out the back for more of the toy, which we don't have any more of anyway.

Me - Excuse me mam but could you please calm down?

W - Calm down? CALM DOWN!? HOW DARE YOU TALK TO ME LIKE THAT YOU $^#*$#*@*!!

Me - Ok I'm calling security.

She precedes to go mental for the 3 minutes it takes security to get there, cursing me and my other colleagues out and even going so far as to threaten the man and they literally have to DRAG her away by under her arms. Her son follows head hanging just another Thursday for him.

As the woman is dragged off screaming into the twilight the man turns and puts the toy back on the shelf and picks up a completely different one.

Me - Sorry mate you can take it if you want?

M - Actually it's not the one he wanted after all...

And off he went on his merry way.

TLDR: Woman screams at a man for taking a toy her son wanted and gets dragged away by security, turns out he grabbed the wrong toy anyway.

"Rude woman gave me the silent treatment yesterday


Hey, TFR, I have an annoying tale for you today!

I work as a retail deli manager and while I have had my fair share of rude customers, this particular interaction was uniquely frustrating. I am a very helpful person and, despite not knowing where every item in the store is located yet, am always willing to help a customer find what they are looking for.

I was stocking my salesfloor case when I overheard a lady proclaim loudly for all to hear, *""I hate this store, I can never find what I'm looking for!""*

Now's my chance! I stop what I'm doing and turn toward the customer and say to her, over a display, ""Hi, what are you looking for?""

Silence.

Okay, I thought maybe she didn't hear me or didn't see me since there was a display between us. She turned into the main aisle and passed right by me and I said, ""Excuse me, what can I help you find?""

Silence.

The lady, followed by her younger daughter and teenage daughter turn down the aisle directly across from me and the daughter stops and yells back at her mom, ""Hey, he's trying to help!"" The lady ignores her daughter and keeps walking. 

The daughter turns to me and I can see her soul dying. She starts to say, ""we're looking for..."" then, from down the aisle, Satan herself snarls,

*""COME ON""*

The daughter, her soul having fully departed her body leaving nothing but a husk behind says to me, ""I'm so sorry"" and she turns and follows her mom.

My customer service switch flipped off and I said to her, loud enough for her mother to hear, ""It's not your fault, some people are just rude and you can't please them"".

I'm still irritated.

TLDR: rude woman ignores me when I offer her help"
