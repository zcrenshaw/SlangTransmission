"I [24f] dated a man [40m], not knowing he was married. His wife [??f] is demanding I repay the $6,200 he spent on me



I knew a guy, Clarence, from my old job that I left about a year ago. I didn't know him well when I worked there, I worked with him occasionally but we didn't talk outside of work. He presented himself as single, didn't wear a ring or talk about a girlfriend or wife.

After I left that job, I went out for happy hour with my old coworkers a few times to catch up with some friends. Clarence was there, and after one of those events he asked me out. I accepted, but made it clear that I wasn't looking for anything serious or long term. I was in a transitional part of my life, spending a lot of time on my career, physical fitness, and general self improvement, so a relationship wasn't in the cards.

He was fine with that, and the first time we went out I suggested we go somewhere cheap, like the local dive bar with $2 beers and $6 meals, because I was on a tight budget. He said that he didn't want to go to a college bar, he was happy to treat me to something nicer. His idea of ""nicer"" was kind of ridiculous to me, each of my drinks cost $40... And that became a pattern, I'd suggest going somewhere within my budget so I could cover the bill for once, he'd refuse and take me somewhere mad expensive. 

We were hooking up through all this btw.

He also started gifting me stuff, perfume, makeup, spa and massage and manicure vouchers, and wouldn't let me refuse. He'd say stuff like ""I already bought this, what am I going to do with make up?"" But I don't wear makeup much, or perfume, and I'm not super relaxed during massages because it's awkward being rubbed by a stranger. So I'd start quietly re-gifting those things to my female friends. The only thing that I kept was a designer coat.

I started feeling more and more uncomfortable, it felt like he was trying to buy my attention, and he wanted something more than casual hookups. My friends were making fun of me all the time for having a ""sugar daddy"". I felt like he wanted me to be something I'm not; all perfumed and made up, and dressed up for fancy dates, when I would have had more fun hanging out in a dive bar, or going and doing something active.

So I ended things, saying that it felt like he wanted me to be someone I'm not. He tried to get me to reconsider a few times, but I didn't. I thought that was all in the past, until I got a text from a stranger.

-----

She said she was Clarence's wife, her name was Zoey, and she'd found out about me. She was pretty angry, calling me a homewrecker and cussing me out in a way I'd rather not repeat.

I told her I was really sorry, this was the first I'd heard about him being married, the few months he'd been taking me out, he'd presented himself as single. And I hadn't seen him in months, I'd ended things with him for my own reasons.

She sent me another bunch of texts, saying she didn't believe me, and saying I owed her $6,200. Apparently she had gone through the bank statements and tallied up everything he spent on me, over the months we were seeing each other. She said that the money he spent was their joint money, and I had no right to things bought with money that was their marital property. She hinted at taking legal action against me.

I haven't replied yet. 

I don't have the money to give her. And while I feel awful he stole from her, and cheated on her with me... Honestly that was his decision, not mine. 

I don't know whether to reply to her and say I don't have that kind of money laying around and I've regifted almost everything he gave me.

Or if I should contact Clarence and tell him he needs to sort out his own marital issues without dragging me into it.

Or if I should just ghost them both, and wash my hands of it all, unless I actually do hear from a lawyer? (Which I think is unlikely tbh)

TLDR - I dated an older man, I didn't know he was married. I broke things off for my own reasons. Several months later, his wife contacted me, demanding I repay the $6,200 he apparently spent on me.

"My crush [24/F] needs a kidney transplant. Would it be weird if I [23/M] offered to be a donor?


There's this girl at work that I like and I know she likes me as well. Her friends have told me that she likes me and I can also tell by how she acts around me.

A few weeks ago, she was diagnosed with stage 3 kidney disease. Her doctor told her that she doesn't have much to worry about yet, but she should at least start looking into getting a kidney transplant sooner than later. The disease is worse because she was only born with one kidney and failure of that one means a lifetime of dialysis. Apparently a kidney transplant is safer for her in terms of her long term health and she told me that she's most likely going to be getting a transplant soon. But today at work, she said that she can't any friends or family who are a match for her. I guess the frustration must have really got to her because she broke down and started crying about not wanting her one kidney to fail. I felt terrible and I wanted to make the offer to see if I'm a match, but I held back because that seemed...off, at least to me.

Would it be weird if I at least volunteered to see if I'm a match with her to consider being a donor? It's not like me and her are just two strangers who have crushes on one another. We've been working together for years and we're pretty good friends. I obviously really like her and I hate seeing her this stressed out and upset. Would it be weird to be her donor or am I just over-thinking things?

&amp;#x200B;

tldr: Crush needs a kidney, might want to be her donor."
"My fiancee [30 M] sometimes hits me [32 F] in his sleep, not sure what to do


I'd like to say before I start this, that when my fiancee is awake, he is a gentle, extremely loving person, and has never made me feel afraid for my safety, ever. However, like it says in the title, sometimes he will sleep-hit me, as in, he'll slap me in the face or grab me forcefully while he's completely asleep. Usually, his eyes will be open and he'll be grinding his teeth really intensely when it happens. It's scary for both of us, for me in the moment, and for him, when he wakes up as I'm trying to shove him off of me and I tell him what's happened.


This morning, again when he was totally asleep, he hit me in the side of the head, and raised his hand to do it again, but I got away from him. I love him, and I want to stay with him, but neither one of us knows what to do. Does anybody have any experience with this kind of sleep behavior and how to address it? 


tldr - fiancee hits me or grabs me while he's asleep, neither of us know how to solve this. "
"I [23F] am worried for my brother's [35M] mental health, hatred of women and considering he might just be a bad person. Can I help him somehow?


He has always been important in my life and I think I used to idolize him years back, but over the past few years I have been seeing him act very contrary to who I thought he was.

Some of the things I have noticed come from direct experience with him, and other from his Facebook rants. He rants on Facebook, a lot. About having a bad day, why his favorite sports team lost/won, and sending indirect references to women in his life (""Just saw my least favorite ex right now""). He also says a lot of things about women being X, Y, Z, both in person and online.

He's told me straight to my face that natural blondes are dumb, says things like this/that woman from is ""insignificant"" about women from his work or childhood friends of mine. He frequently bad mouths his ex-wife (who is actually a very kind woman and they divorced because she was infertile and didn't know) and has kinda like mantras about dealing with women in sex/life.

He thinks catcalling is OK because if a women dresses well, she wants to be seen and receive attention.

He's also maybe depressed, because he shares thinks like ""X band is good for feeling depressed"" and sharing articles about signs of depression, depressed celebrities.

I mean, on one hand I'm disgusted by things he says, but he also helped me a lot going through high and college and is always there for mom so my first thought is always ""he must be going through a bad time and saying things he doesn't mean"", but he actually means them if he's been spouting them for years with little filter, and it hurts a bit to think that the person who was there for me is actually a bad hateful person who says the cruelest things to people he simply doesn't like (mostly women, though).

Can I do something? Would it help if I tell him that he's just becoming a very bitter person? Would it do anything to try?

**tl;dr:** Brother who I love very much is actually a generally unkind and bad person to people he doesn't like (mostly women). Can I talk to him in hopes of maybe getting him to realise how he's acting? Would I help, maybe?"
"Ex sent me a gift card for my birthday, but we haven't spoken in months.


Background: My (22 F) ex (25 M) and I had a major falling out after he used all the fantastic gaslighting techniques and keeping me as a backup option because he's in a long distance relationship with another girl for about a year and a half now (25 F). We were best friends after we broke up (we dated for year and a half) but I realize now that this was only because he wasn't sure how things were going to end up with her. Basically he would tell her that we were just friends even though we would hook up and he would tell me that they weren't serious. An example is we took a trip together and he told her he was going with a ""bunch of friends"" but it was just him and I.

&amp;#x200B;

Fast forward to around August, I move back home and we no longer live in the same city. I found out that she is moving to our country to live with him in a few months because she decided to contact me to ask what was going on and this led to me telling her everything that he had been saying to both of us (I was able to see his messages to her). I cut off all contact with both of them and blocked them on everything because I knew it was destroying my life and making me very depressed.

&amp;#x200B;

I happily moved on with my life and I am now in a great relationship with a guy who treats me well, truly loves me, and always makes me feel safe/secure in the relationship. However, just a few days ago I get a delivery and lo and behold, it's a birthday gift card from my ex boyfriend for a pretty considerable amount.

&amp;#x200B;

I need advice on how to approach this. I feel like this is another tactic he's using to get me back in his life and I really do not want to go down that road again because I am so much happier with my life now. This all seems very weird to me to because one of his last messages to me was about how we would never talk again. I have no idea what's going on with his relationship since I cut off all contact/blocked him on everything.

&amp;#x200B;

Is this his way to get me back in his life and why? Do I ask him why he sent me this large gift card? Do I just ignore it and move on? Do I return it? (it says I can do that and he won't be notified, but I'll still get the gift card amount back so this option seems pointless because I'm still keeping the money one way or another). Please help, advice is much appreciated!

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR Ex sent me a gift card for my birthday, but we haven't spoken in months. His long distance gf is moving from another country to live with him even though he had previously been cheating on her with me. Is this his way to get me back in his life and why?"
"Old friend [27M] is dating his second cousin [20sF] and I [26M] kinda don't want them around my get togethers. Am I being an asshole?


I learned a month ago. I have known them both for years (him since 5th grade, her since I was 15) and it's just weird to see them like that.

We have a big group of friends and everyone knows but no one says anything about it, she's just a girl he's dating, like many other girls he's introduced to us before.

The thing is, I don't want them around my get togethers. We haven't hung out at my place since they are together but my birthday will be next month and we always do a something at my place with lots of friends, and I don't want them around my home honestly.

Am I an asshole? I don't think I have the nerve to actually tell them to their faces. It would probably destroy our friendship but I just feel the weirdest thing around them and don't want that at my place. It's like to me, she's that toxic friend's partner no one wants to hang with, but she's not actually toxic, just her cousin and that weirds me the fuck out.

Am I wrong? Should I ask him to not bring her? Or any other alternative?

**tl;dr:** Friend is dating second cousin and I don't want them around my birthday party because it weirds me out. Am I an asshole? Is there some alternative to outright barring them?"

"VideoGame Problem between GF (25 F) and me (22 M)


My GF (25 F) and I (22 M) both like to play games.

However we have the same argument over and over.

&amp;#x200B;

Whenever I play a game and I think it would be fun for both of us. I suggest we play it together.

However after I do this, whenever she sees me playing this game alone. She gets super sulky and annoyed.

&amp;#x200B;

Example:

I suggested we should play a game Path of Exile together. You can have multiple characters so I would create a new one to play with her.

Today she saw me play this game and it went like this:

She:  Wow now that I didn't plan anything today you don't ask me to play together.

Me: I didn't know, and you can ask me to play together as well. I am free :) 

Her: I just don't like this feeling. You ask me to play things with you but you still play them without me. Or you ask me to play things you already know inside-out.

You know what Nvm. I'm complaining again and take away your urge to game because I'm whining again.

Me: If it bothers you we can talk about it! I'd rather do this not over chat, so if you want to call I'm free.

\----

After this I see her log onto another game that I asked to play together and then go offline. Normally she is always away instead of offline so I assume she just appeared offline to be alone.

I don't mind it, if she wants to play alone or needs time.

&amp;#x200B;

But all of this feels pretty off to me.

&amp;#x200B;

Am I right? Or am I totally missing the point?

&amp;#x200B;

Thanks!

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR Whenever I play a game without my gf she gets pissed. What Can I do?"
"I[21 M] am traveling a long distance to visit my girlfriend[21 F] and i think she disregarded my feelings


So i am going to start by saying i am going to try to be as neutral as i can and provide all the necessary facts for you guys to know.

&amp;#x200B;

Firstly, a bit of a background. We started dating 5 months ago and met only 2 months before starting to date. We got along really great , have a great chemistry together, had a lot of dates and had a blast. However, we only dated 1 month before she had to leave for her student exchange program country, on which she would stay there for a semester. She still has 2 more months there, before she returns. She went with 3 other boys, but only one goes to the same college that she goes to,  lets call him T. While i love our relationship and like her a lot, i believe i do most of the work in our relationship and sometimes she takes me for granted and doesn't take me into consideration. 

&amp;#x200B;

So before she left, we were discussing the possibility of me visiting her while she is abroad and concluded that it was too expensive and complicated. Basically the last month that she is staying there she will be traveling a lot as her classes end, so that would the perfect time for me to visit her, because she has more free time. After some time i bring up the idea again and she says she would love to have me visit her and we would have a awesome time together. After some time i keep thinking about it and(since i got a part-time job) i manage to save up the money(and ask my brother for a loan that i will pay in the future) and i tell her that i have the possibility of going there and she is thrilled and enthusiastic. We talk about how serious this step is and if i am prepared to take it and i tell her that i think we're worth it. So i buy the ticket. So i'm traveling 10000 km to the other side of the world to visit her.

&amp;#x200B;

The plan initially was, for the time i would be staying there, me, her and T would be traveling across the country according to a plan. She initially proposed a plan to me where the 3 of us would travel north and i had to get back to the airport alone(wasting almost a day of our time there)  and she and him would pursue their trip farther up north. I told her that was a bit bad for me because besides having to return alone, we would waste a lot of our limited time there separated. She initially said she didn't see a better option but she agreed it sucked and started to make another plan. 

&amp;#x200B;

Now the second plan was great, we travel south, (me her and T) and the up north where they drop me off at the airport and i come back home and they keep going to visit north.  The plan stayed like this for a while, and then T started acting strange and said he wouldn't be coming with us. He justified by saying he wanted to travel north and said that wouldn't want to act as a third wheel and would feel kind of uncomfortable, this was our time. etc.. etc... My girlfriend told me this and said that it would probably be just the two of us now. Then she changed her mind and said she didn't feel ok to leave T alone while he was alone for a lot of time and if something happened to him, in a foreign country with no help, she would feel guilty. She started saying that he had to come with us one way or the other, that he wasn't interrupting a honey moon and that she would talk to him and convince him and said that if it was needed, she wanted me to talk to him too. Now they have friends up north so i thought maybe he could get with them but he said he has a bit curiosity of how things feel while traveling alone and traveling there wasn't in his plans at that time. She mentions changing our plans back to the initial one of going north, on which we waste our time together, because maybe that way he can join us. She disregarded a bit my complains by she saying it would only be some hours. Now i tell her that really sucks for me and she answers she doesn't know what to do.

&amp;#x200B;

I think things through for a while, and try to see things on her side. She encountered great difficulties studying abroad, lived a lot of experiences and grew as a person. She did that with him so i guess they grew closer and bonded a bit. I can see she doesn't want to be a bad friend and ignore him just because her boyfriend is visiting her. Plus right now she has a lot of tests and exams so i thought this is a problem she doesn't need. I decided to give in, explained her my thoughts and told her that if she wants to go north, let's go north.  She said she ""wanted to hug me so hard right now"" and that she would talk with T again. Apparently T's grandfather died and he is really sad so we still haven't got his response. 

&amp;#x200B;

Now things get a bit messy. 

I told her i felt a bit  undervalued and my feelings were completely disregarded. I told her it felt like i was third wheeling the two of them and left for team B.  She responded and said, that it wasn't her intention to leave me like that and i wasn't certainly team B, me and T were both team A. She says that she puts her boyfriend and friends in the same priority level and some of her friends up higher(her closest). To her, i am as important as some of her friends and less important than others . She also said that it didn't make sense to visit the country and the surroundings without T because they are on it together. Now we have only been dating for 5 months and i agree with friend prioritizing thing, because lets be honest, 5 months isn't 5 years, but i am traveling 10000km and spending a lot of money to spend time with her and i don't think she is taking that into consideration. I believe she started to protect T from whatever he might think of her and completely forgot about me.

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR: Traveling long distance and making a great effort to visit my girlfriend she doesn't really show the same level of commitment towards me in the planing of my visit time there.

&amp;#x200B;

"My crush [24/F] has started acting really weird and it lead to a fight between me and her. Did I [23/M] just ruin things between us?


There was this girl at work that I like and I know she liked me as well, up until recently.

One day last week, she was acting perfectly normal. She said hi to me at the start of our shift, we talked like good friends, and nothing seemed out of the ordinary. But the very next day, she starts ignoring me. I said hi to her, but she just ignores me and shoots me a dirty look. And when I said bye to her at the end of our shift, she again ignores me and just walks right by me.

Then the day after that, our boss tells us that she quit without even turning in her two weeks notice . She just up and left the day before. That was a bummer because I was really planning on asking her out, so I decided to text her. I just sent a simple ""Hey, what's up?"" But then I get a notification from my phone saying that she blocked me. That's when I decided to message her on Facebook and that's when things got ugly.

I messaged her and she replied by saying that she doesn't like me anymore and that I need to stop messaging her. My short temper got the better of me and I messaged her ""Fine, I didn't want to date you anyway. You smell like shit and you're a cunt."" She then blocked me.

Looking back on that, I really regret that it had to come to that. I just want to know what was up with her sudden weird behavior. More importantly, I still admittedly have feelings for her, but I feel like I just ruined things between us. What do you think of all of this?

tldr: Fought with crush, things might be over for us."
"My [27f] younger brother [25m] is ruining my parents lives


My younger brother has always been different, at age ~12 he told us that he hated our family and especially my dad. It continued for every family vacation, a meltdown about how he hates us. (We assumed he was taking out his hardships in life out in us, but it continued) 

My parents have always given him everything he ever wanted, especially my mom. They were always twice as strict with me and now it’s biting them in the ass. (They still ask me to stop by the house when they go out of town..he’s 25) 

He’s a complete asshole and lazy. Can’t hold a basic job but blames “anxiety” and “ADHD” that I’m not 100% sure he has. Always has an excuse. He’s even stolen money from my parents. Thinks he lives in his own universe and everyone else is always wrong no matter what. Has moods swings and is impossible to live with. Things have even gotten physical once when he drinks and fighting with my dad[57]. He only goes out to EDM concerts on the weekend and has no real friends because of his small mindedness and asshole attitude. Even when he gets fired from his jobs there are no repercussions, he still goes out and does what he wants. 

He doesn’t pay rent, he pays for car insurance, his phone and his car. 

Ive tried to have him go back to therapy but he won’t, I also think he lies during the sessions. I’m now trying to get my parents and him to try family therapy but I’m not sure it will go through. I don’t know what else to do or what can I do. They will never kick him out because that’s not what “family” does. I’m so done with him but want my parents to enjoy their retirement without a grow adult in their house ruin their lives.

tl;dr: asshole/lazy younger brother is ruining parents retirement "
"I'm (27f) not able to trust my SO (39m) for no reason at all.


Using a different account for anonymity. 

I (27f) have been dating my SO (39m) for two years now. He is the love of my life and I have no reason not to trust him.

In the past I have been cheated on in my last really significant relationship. He was emotionally manipulative and always made me feel like I was being unreasonable for having any doubts about him.

It's been 5 years since the end of that damaging relationship and I've had another less serious partner in between who I had no cause to mistrust. However I found myself becoming paranoid and suspicious about my last boyfriend for no reason at all. Thoughts like ""what if he's seeing someone behind my back?"" would just pop into my head randomly.

Throughout my current relationship every few months I become unreasonably paranoid that my SO might be cheating on me. There is nothing to trigger this suspicion that is at all reasonable grounds for it. Usually it is triggered simply by him typing on his phone while he's at home. There is a million people he could be messaging or even just posting on Reddit and I know that my brain is just using any tiny thing to help generate this anxiety. When I hear about women he knows my brain just shoots fear through me.

Every time this happens I have to talk myself down from this crazy ledge. I feel like I maintain control over my irrational jealousy externally. I don't think I am overbearing or unreasonable toward him. I doubt he knows the full extent of how regularly distressed I become. I have told him about my emotional baggage regarding my past and I've explained to him that sometimes I get paranoid for no reason because of it but he seems to become a little tired of having to reassure me that I'm his ""everything"" and that he loves me and wouldn't do anything to hurt me. I completely understand how it would become stale having to reassure someone that you're not cheating on them when you theoretically do nothing in between these events to damage the trust between you. 

I feel like I am permanently in this state of paranoia and suspicion and I don't know how to just let go of these insecurities and wholeheartedly trust him. I think it also affects our sex life because I can't let go in bed and switch off my brain and just enjoy what I'm experiencing physically. This means that I have incredible difficulty reaching orgasm in bed. 

I feel as though I'm not be able to get rid of the idea that eventually cheating is inevitable and I constantly have to be on guard so that I don't feel as foolish when I finally discover about this hidden relationship that he's been keeping from me. I know that if anything these ridiculous fears will just push him away if left unchecked and will continue to make me upset for no reason.

What is wrong with me and how the hell do I reprogram my brain to just trust again?

Tl;dr I've been cheated on in the past and now I can't fully trust anyone I'm with even when they do nothing to deserve my mistrust."
"My (28F) husband (31M) told me he wanted to see his friends/colleagues but when I offered to join them, he got furious and said he’d rather not go. I have a feeling he might be cheating on me again. Am i just being paranoid?


I’m writing this via mobile and just 30mins after our argument. So here’s how the it went. 


He was my plus 1 at my company’s dinner and dance tonight. We both had fun but when it was time to go home, he told me that he needed to meet his friends/colleagues and that they were waiting for him at this place. He offered to call a cab for me to take me home. I got mad because I was expecting that we would come home together seeing as we both came from my company event. So I told him that I would go with him to meet his friends instead. He got annoyed at me and told me that I was being dramatic. That he was going to discuss work stuff that wont concern me at all. And I said fine then I’ll just drop you off. He got furious and said he won’t go at all. It sounded so fishy, like first of all, why doesn’t he like me to go with him or even just drop him off? Was he hiding something from me? 


Note: my husband has cheated on me a couple of times before. And he would often time use work as an excuse to rendezvous with the other women. He even “lent” one woman $5k++ and guess what, that money didn’t return anymore. 


All I wanted was for him to be honest with me and tell me the truth and let me in. I just want to have security and assurance that he’s not cheating on me anymore. Instead all he does was make me suspicious and keep me paranoid. I would beg him to see where I’m coming from but all he does was attack me and say I was being dramatic. 


TL;DR: My husband (who had been unfaithful a couple of times before) told me he wanted to see his friends/colleagues but when I offered to join them, he got furious and said he’d rather not go. I have a feeling he might be cheating on me again. Am i just being paranoid?"
"Me [17 M] with my friend [15 F], not sure if I'm attracted to her.


I've known this girl for 7 months. We met up at a rock concert but didn't really talk until a couple of days later, when I got her number and messaged her. Initially I wasn't aiming at anything romantic but that was definitely a possibility to me. She was faster, though, and proposed we should kiss really early on.

Now, here's the deal: I definitely think she's pretty. Her hair is awesome, she has a beautiful smile, great natural tan, etc. but I'm not sure if I'm attracted to her. In 7 months, we never got around to kissing partly because we don't see each other that often, but mainly because we went back and forth a lot on whether or not we are attracted to each other.

We get along very well, we're very good friends. Sometimes, I catch myself thinking about her and the possibility of pursuing her romantically. I can never fully commit to that idea though and I don't understand why. I think she looks really good on her pictures on Instagram and she can be absolutely stunning or just not that attractive to me at times, depending on the situation.

I don't know, I think you get the idea, I'm just rambling at this point. Can anyone shed some light?

TL;DR: Met girl, she's pretty, we get along great and have thought of getting together in the past. Not sure if I should pursue romantically and don't know if I'm attracted to her."
"I (22M) am to scared to ask the girl (20F) out


So, as the title says I'm literally terrified of talking to her. I see her most days as she works behind the bar I go to after work, in fact she actually comes to have a drink with us when she's done. She's so beautiful and so funny. Only there's a catch, my partner at work is her dad. 

Now I respect him tremendously and he's been such a good friend and colleague to me I feel like I'd be disrespectful asking her out.

I'd consider my self fairly good looking. I don't normally get nervous like this as I've had a few (failed) relationships in the past but something about her makes me so excited and nervous that I don't normally feel around women.

To top it off she hasn't long split up with her boyfriend of 2+ years. So Reddit how do I proceed ? If I proceed at all. She keeps me up all night but I can't do it for fear of her saying no. I'm absolutely lost, my heart wants nothing more to go for it but my brain says ""don't shit where you eat""

Sorry for the terrible formatting and grammar - I'm on my phone and 'm completely lost for words. I hope you guys can give me some advice because god knows I need it.

"Me (19m) with my boyfriend (42m) of 1.5 years. He would like me to stop being friends with some of my friends.


My boyfriend wants me to stop being friends or at least go low contact with some of my friends. He believes they are sort of a bad influence on me and that I'm unable to recognize that because my own meter of what is normal is skewed. He says that being friends with these people destroys me emotionally and that making new friends would make it easier for me to handle my own mental health.

I don't know. Maybe he's right and the bad outweighs the good... It is true that it upsets me to hear about these people's problems, but I believe that's what friends are for.

Well, here are the worst things about each of my friends. (Of course, there are also many good things about them! But that's for another thread)

* Friend 1 struggles with depression and indulges in self-harm with a bit of attention seeking. A week ago he cut his arm open and sent me a pic of the ugly wound. Needless to say, it upset me quite a bit. BF says it's a very bad sign this friend doesn't intend to seek help for his issues.

* Friend 2 struggles with depression and suicidal ideation. He talks to me about these issues when he's at a low point. To be honest, it happens fairly often. BF says I should not try to be his therapist because it takes a toll on me and drains me emotionally. He's not wrong, I tend to take my friend's problems close to heart...

* Friend 3 has been in a very bad financial situation due to a period of unemployment and inability to hold a job (sometimes his own fault, sometime's no one's fault – an injury, for example) but won't accept help from me. We became friends a few years ago, before I met my bf. Back then we were both poor; now I'm in a position to help him out but he won't accept my help. Our conversations on this subject have led me to believe that he considers me somewhat “inferior” to him (not sure if that's the correct English word), and won't accept help because of that. Things like, I'm younger than him (he's 26 currently), and I do not work myself, as my boyfriend covers my expenses. This upsets me a lot, but I try not to think about it. BF says my friend is being unreasonable and that I should not be friends with people who don't consider me an equal. 

* Friend 4... Idk how to put it softly... Is a little messed up as a result of childhood abuse. Cheated on their SO with a guy who had r-*-*-e-d them in the past. Currently in a relationship with that guy. Talks to me when the guy goes back to his abusive behavior, but doesn't even consider leaving him... This upsets me more than anything. My boyfriend has seen me crying because of this friend's hardships more than once... He says I can't help those who don't want to help themselves.

I would like to emphasize that these people helped me in the past and supported me when I needed it. They are not bad people by any means. There's a lot of good about them. It's just the circumstances are wrong, I guess. I care about each of them and I feel like it's my duty as a friend to try and help, or at least to be there and listen to what they have to say. My boyfriend basically says that now that I'm in college, it's a new stage of my life and I can make new friends that won't exhaust me as much.

TL;DR: BF says my friends are exhausting me emotionally and affecting my mental health. It's hard to disagree, but I don't want to ditch them, because I care about them. Should I listen to my BF?"
"My [33 M] wife [37 F] of 8 years, 9th anniversary at end of this month, kissed her co-worker/old HS crush.


My wife and I were good friends for 5 years, dated for almost another 5 and have been married for 8, have 2 kids, with our 9th anniversary coming up at the end of this month. Prior to marriage, she had dated only one other guy, I dated several others and we were each other's firsts.

When we were dating, there was an incident with a coworker of hers, we'll call him Chris. She felt attraction for him as did Chris for her. There was friendly hugging and he gave her gifts such as a Victoria's Secret gift card and invited her to go to the movies. My wife thought about it for a few days before asking me if she could go. Obviously I said no and we got into a serious discussion. We moved on from it or so I thought.

Fast forward to a few weeks ago from today, she (a type of therapist) was at a crossroads at her current workplace. She was considering going to another company after having worked there for several years. We discussed this together and the idea of her going to private practice came up. I suggested she reach out to her contacts for advice on starting a business and start networking.

One day, she runs into her old HS crush at a coffee shop. We'll call him ""DC"". DC has his own practice (psychologist)and does well for himself. My wife and DC started to talk about it and after a few talks, he convinces her to work with him for a few sessions. He has requests for his services that he professionally cannot take because that's not his area - it is for my wife though.

They drive out for a few sessions here and there, she does some work free of cost in return of advice and mentorship on starting a business. I notice lately that they've been texting each other pretty late and I joke to her about it saying things like ""Oh who's that secret lover are you texting so late"". I know it's him because she's told me who it was and showed me a few texts. The texting at night occurs sometimes when I'm sitting next to her. There isn't anything unusual in their conversations asides the joking and friendly workplace flirting/teasing.

A few days after I joke about the texting, she comes home an hour later than usual. I ask her about her day and she said she went on a walk around a park with him to talk and catch up on times (remember they used to go to HS together). I also joke about it saying that I wasn't invited to their date. She says it wasn't anything like that, it was just a walk and talk kinda deal with a friend/coworker.

At the end of the following day, she comes home crying. She told me that she told DC they could only be friends, she had attraction to him and she was sorry. I was numb. While I had joked about the texting and the walk, I was slightly suspicious of the behavior but chose to trust her.

We had a serious conversation. She was attracted to him and wanted to see how far it went. She states that she wasn't trying to sleep with him but was very interested in him. In our conversation, I told her I didn't fully believe that statement and asked her what would've happened if I didn't joke about it? How far would it have gone?

She admits that she was interested emotionally. She is curious about him. I agreed with her that nothing happened, and understanding feelings can occur (human nature, etc) but had hoped she would taken precautions a bit earlier. After that conversation, things somewhat returned to normal.

2 days later, after we had sex and were going to take a shower, she asked if she could kiss him. She was interested in what kissing him was like. She wasn't interested in running off with him or having sex, but she wanted to know what kissing him was like. Not just a peck but tongue and possibly makeout session. At this point my heart sank.

After struggling with this, I told her that this was her choice, and like it is everyday, we have to make choices. I did tell her that if you do anything to tell me. I don't want anything to be hidden from each other and that if you made the choice to kiss him, that things would probably change. At the least, I probably wouldn't want to kiss or be intimate with her. At the worst, who knows what could happen.

At the end of that day, she told me she kissed him. My heart sank and broke. She had knowingly and intentionally kissed him. I was sad. She admitted that she chose her own desires and selfishness and said she didn't think she did anything wrong. She keeps telling me she loves me, that she has everything she needs with me/isn't lacking anything and she only did it to find out more about herself and that she's done with it. I feel like she's broken the ""marriage"" in the sense when we got married, we agreed to make sacrifices and dedicate to each other. We've thrown the divorce word a few times. She says she understands and won't fault me if I leave but wants to be with me.

I'm hurt and I am looking for advice (do I stay, do I leave, do I do something else) or just someone to type and chat with.


TL;DR Wife of 9 years, kissed a coworker, doesn't think anything was wrong and I'm not sure what to do."

Thanks for reading and would appricate for help!"
"My (24m) little brother (16m) got his girlfriend (16f) pregnant. They are asking me for advice/help and I don’t know what to do.


My little brother “Ben” has never had any trouble getting girls. He’s athletic, pretty handsome and has loads of friends. I’m honestly really proud of him despite our parents putting him on a pedestal and thinking that he can make no mistakes. Because of this, he never goes to them when he makes a mistake, he comes to me. 

I’ve fucked up a lot in my life, got addicted to drugs, got sober, got my life together and now I live a pretty comfortable life. Because of this, he feels like he can come to me because I don’t judge him. 

Two days ago he came over to my place and said that he needed my help. He said that he got his girlfriend “Taylor” pregnant. He said that I’m the first one that he has told. 

Honestly, I kind of laid into him at first, asking him how fucking stupid can he be, and what the fuck he expects me to do about it. 

He says that him and Taylor have talked about getting an abortion but she doesn’t want to tell her super religious family because they would force her to have the baby and he won’t tell my parents because they would either blame her or they will freak out more than normal because of his perfect image. 

She wasn’t there when he told me this but he also asked if she could stay here a few days after the abortion so she could recover and not be around her parents. 

He asked me if I would be willing to take him and her for the abortion and to pay for it. Honestly I am at a loss for what to do. I’m pretty broke and I’m not sure how much an abortion would cost me and I’m not sure if I should just tell my parents? I feel like they would either not believe me or blame me for being a bad influence on him because of my history. I haven’t been close to my parents ever since I got sober. They don’t trust me anymore and my brother comes to see me behind their backs. 

I really don’t want to be blamed if our parents found out and further blamed for “being a bad influence” on him. But if she needs an abortion I want to be there for them. They don’t really have anyone else. 

What should I do? Should I take them for the abortion and pay for it or should I just tell our parents and let them handle it? I really don’t want to just hang them out to dry but I’m kind of freaking out about what to do here. 

Tl;dr: My little bro got his girlfriend pregnant and is coming to me for advice. "
"My husband (28m) doesn't discuss having kids and it's affecting my (30f) feelings about our relationship


We've been together for five years, married for 3.5. I love my husband so much, but this is a sore point in our relationship. It's only just hit me how hurtful it truly is. 

&amp;#x200B;

He's an accountant and has always been mindful of our long-term goals: getting our finances in order, making sure our accounts are good, scouting business and investment opportunities, and setting up retirement funds. He's always talking about the next step we need to take to make sure we are financially independent or at least comfortable. Nevertheless, he has never brought up having kids together or how we should plan in case we decide to have a child. It always surprised me because it seems like something he would definitely plan for if he were actually considering it. Before we got married, we both said that we wanted to have children, so this is not something unexpected.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm always the one to bring up the topic, but I feel that he brushes my questions aside. A couple of years ago, he mentioned that my schedule was too hectic and it would be too difficult. I agreed with him. I was finishing up grad school and working crazy hours. Once I graduated, however, I brought it up again and he mentioned that I still did not have a stable job and I should stabilize myself first. I agreed, but told him that I would like if he also considered the topic more seriously. The fact that he never once initiated the conversation made me think that he wasn't actually considering it. Plus, I was starting to feel that there was a moving goalpost and that he would keep changing his mind. He promised that he would be more considerate of my feelings regarding this topic.

&amp;#x200B;

Earlier this year, I started job hunting and was getting called in for interviews. I felt confident I was going to be offered the job and was incredibly excited. I hinted at my husband that maybe we should start getting our finances in order so we can have a kid within the next couple of years. He replied that we still had a lot of time to think about having a kid. At that point, I burst into angry tears. I told him he was not taking me seriously; I was tired of bringing up the topic and the fact that he never wanted to discuss it made me think that he didn't care about my feelings. It felt like he added a new condition every time we met the old one. Most of all, I felt incredibly pathetic! I couldn't believe I was crying because I wanted my husband to just TALK and plan on having a child with me. My husband apologized and consoled me. He promised me that he would discuss the topic and assured me that he wasn't ""adding conditions."" He said he just wanted to be secure and stable. I let it go because I was focused on finding a job. I thought if this is his main concern, then we would have to wait until I was secure in a position.

&amp;#x200B;

I was offered a full-time benefited position 4 months ago. It's been taking me a while to get settled in, but I'm happy that I got the job. Once I was offered the position, my husband sat with me and discussed ""our new financial plan,"" but still no mention of kids. I didn't touch on the subject either. It wasn't until last weekend that I brought it up, and he replied, ""You're coming home late. How can we have a kid?"" I reminded him that my schedule will be stabilized by January--I will be working a regular day schedule. We had a huge fight because, again, I felt that he was avoiding the topic and adding more conditions. It's been 3 days since then, and I can't help but feel defeated and drained. I came home today and cried to him about how this bothers me. He reassured me and told me that he loves me and wants to have kids with me. He apologized (again) for not discussing the topic and promised me that we would plan for kids soon. I feel like I can't forgive him this time though. I can't help but feel that he's just saying it to appease me, and not because he really wants to. Even if he brought it up, I just think it would feel forced. It's not the same if I have to practically beg him to bring it up.

&amp;#x200B;

I can't sleep now, and I've been seriously contemplating divorce over this. My husband has always been incredibly supportive of me; he encouraged me to go back to grad school and stood by my side during my most trying times. I just can't believe that he, ""the planner,"" has not even thought about this. I'm tired of always being the one to bring it up. I'm even more hurt because I made it clear how much I would appreciate it if he actually talked about it, but he still hasn't done it.

&amp;#x200B;

tl;dr: Husband and I decided we wanted to have kids before we got married, but now he's avoiding the topic. I'm sick of bringing it up and practically begging him to plan for a future with kids. 

Am I being unreasonable? Is it typical for couples to avoid this topic? I just don't know what to think right now. "
"I (24M) caught my girlfriends (21F) dad cheating on her mom with another man. He told me that his wife knows, but that his daughter doesn't, and he wants to keep it that way.


I was sleeping over my girlfriends house (she lives with her parents) and I woke up and went to the bathroom downstairs. I went downstairs and saw, in the backyard, my girlfriends dad receiving a handjob from another guy. The guy was here before, I remember being introduced to him as 'his friend' and the wife was friendly with him and everything, he stayed for coffee. Her dad saw me and right away had this ""oh fuck"" face on, and got up quickly and came inside. He just sort of told me that he was really sorry I had to witness that, and that he did not realize anyone was going to be coming down. I just didn't say anything, I was really confused. He then quickly told me that his wife knows, and she has known since they got married, and that he is gay and they got married because even though they didn't love each other they were best friends, and that both of them have other partners that they sleep with. He then said that his daughter (my gf) has no idea, and that he has always told her that they were a loving couple. He begged me not to say anything to her, because he doesn't want her realizing that her parents were never actually in love. 

&amp;#x200B;

He honestly spoke so fast and so hurried that I barely even understood what he said the first time around. I just sort of nodded my head and said alright, alright, I wont tell her. I just said ""you do you man"" and went upstairs. 

&amp;#x200B;

Its the next day now, we had breakfast and it was pretty awkward but he acted normal around me. Now its the next day and I just really don't know what to say to her. Do I 'out' her dad? I mean shes my girlfriend I am supposed to tell her everything. We've been dating for about 8-9 months now, so its not a super long term relationship, but still. Also she would get upset at me if I didn't tell her. 

&amp;#x200B;

What do you guys think? Should I tell her? 

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR - - Found out my girlfriends dad is gay, he told me to keep it a secret. "
"My girlfriend (21F) and I (21M) are planning on moving in together but she's worried


 So, my girlfriend and I have been together for just over 14 months now and we're planning on moving in together after I graduate in July. this has been the plan all along since we started as it being an LDR, we needed to know that there was a light at the end of the tunnel. Up until a month ago she seemed really positive but then she started a new university course and when ever I brought up the topic and how excited I was she seemed to either shy away or ignore it completely. we talked about it and she told me it was just the stress of her new course. She's loving it and is really passionate about it (which I'm super proud of don't get me wrong) but she's starting to leave me by the wayside as it were.

despite being an LDR we've always made the effort to visit each other at least once a month and we've always had amazing times. Don't get me wrong, there were some struggling times, but like any relationship you have to accept your partners short comings and accept they're not perfect and neither are you.

For me, I'm worried about not finding a job. It's a completely new country with a completely different way of doing things; I've learned the language in our time together and she seems to appreciate that, especially her family seeing as they speak very little English. But, when ever I mention that I'm looking for jobs or working on my CV/cover letter she seems to not offer any support. it makes me feel worried about moving to be with her as I don't want to put all this effort in to hear her say that she doesn't want it anymore.

one more minor thing;

\-she doesn't reply when I tell her I love her, she just ignores it or moves on.

She says she's excited for Christmas and new year when we next see each other so with all these conflicting thought's going through my head it's really starting to get me down.

I'd really appreciate some advice on the situation as I'm at loss. I've talked to her about it but she doesn't seem willing to change and I obviously can't change her worries about me moving over there.

\*\*TL;DR; : my girlfriend is worried about us ending the distance and moving in together\*\*."

"I [26 M] have been talking to [22 F] two months, love being with her but am convinced she isn't trustworthy. I want to be with her and feel that I'm ignoring red flags.


Just to preface this, I know it's going to be long. I have a gut feeling and am having trouble figuring out if I should listen to it or give her a chance, so a lot of the details are necessary. Definitely appreciate anyone who is able to read through this. I've tried to break everything up neatly, situation by situation. 

----

I just got out of a 5 year relationship and moved cities. Anna has been in a 1 year relationship and was broken up with when she moved to this city after finishing college. Anna had broken up with him a few times before but this time he ended it. 

She never made it sound like they were serious, kind of described it as an on/off type of thing. About a month ago (one month after she and I met) we were walking downtown after having an amazing morning of breakfast, coffee, and sex. We saw her ex boyfriend as we walked, suddenly he was right in front of us drinking at a bar that faced the street.

Anna started chatting with him as I chatted with his friends, not knowing who he was. She didn't introduce me. They kept chatting so I started to walk away, being uncomfortable that I was ignored while she talked to this dude. She chased me down, sobbing, and I tried to comfort her. 

Later on when everything had settled I let her know my exact feelings, that I didn't feel she had been 100% open with how serious her last relationship was. I let her know it made me uncomfortable that she was crying over him just from seeing him on the street. I said this situation didn't especially help the trust I felt, but I acknowledged that we had only been talking for about a month - it's not realistic for me to know all of the details of her life at that point. 


-----

We continued to spend most days together. I left to spend a week in California for business in early October. We still talked the whole time. I got back and she told me how productive she had been while I was gone. She wanted to continue perfecting her routine and said she didn't mean to jump into a new relationship so fast, even if it was casual. Anna mentioned that she was looking to date around, but had serious feelings for me and needed to spend more time with herself.

Every time we spend time together we look up and suddenly it's 2am on a week night. The time goes by so fast when we talk. Both of us agreed that this was interfering with our lives, and we made a point to get home sooner and make more time for ourselves. Slowly we've reverted to the 2am thing. 

-----

Two weeks ago I took Anna to a show and paid $100 for the two of our tickets. She ran into one of her good friends while we were there and she introduced me. It was really fun. We stood in the crowd with her and her friend.We smoked a quick blunt in the venue and had a few drinks. 

 This guy started chatting with her single friend and seemed to want to dance with her, but she wasn't going for it, so he continued to lurk. Eventually he had wedged himself between the two of us and the friend. 

Anna reaches out for her friend, and squeezes through the crowd to get closer to her. Now the random dude is between Anna and I, with her back facing him. Anna was ""dancing with her friend"" while the random guy kept getting closer, trying to dance with her. They kept getting closer, and closer, and closer as I stood there behind him just watching, wondering what the right move was. Should I get her attention? Should I just leave?

They continued to get closer and it looked like she was just about to start dancing on him. As badly as I wanted to see what would happen, just for my own information, I scooted around him and got between them, putting my hands on her waist. It seemed like she continued gravitating toward him. She leaned her head back on my shoulder, and then turned it a bit so that it was closer to him. Hard to describe because it was subtle, but it seemed intentional, which is the only thin I was concerned with. 

The random dude was trying to get my attention while she was dancing with me. I don't know what he was yelling, but he was shouting things at the side of my face. I didn't respond or acknowledge him because I wanted to enjoy my night. 

On the way home I asked her opinion on dancing with people while you're talking to someone. 

""Well, I think it's fi- actually I wouldn't want you to do that to me, so I guess I'll say I don't prefer that""

I say that I agree, but continue and say, ""Sometimes it just happens though, right?""

Hesitantly she agrees, that sometimes it just happens. 

I continue, ""because it really seemed like you were trying to dance with that dude and I'm just trying to understand what I just *watched* happen""

She responds saying that she thought she was with me the whole night. That I had been behind her the whole time. She said she would never dance with someone else because it would hurt me. I gave her the benefit of the doubt and noted what happened. 

-----

Four days ago I watch a football game with her and her parents. The bar we're at is really crowded and we're all ordering drinks and appetizers. Our server is our age and is a pretty good looking guy. 

She was a little extra chatty with him. Of course she had been drinking so whatever, and she's just friendly with everyone.

He says to the table what a stressful day he had been having. As he's leaving she stands up to go to the bathroom. She puts her hand on his shoulder and leans in to say something in his ear. 

A few minutes later he brings us more drinks. Anna's parents eventually leave. She tells me that she invited our server to smoke with us because he was stressed. 

I had been out of town for a few days and this was the first time I had seen her in a while. I didn't want to fight but I was getting a really weird feeling about what she had just told me. We're on the way back to my house and I say it's a shame our server couldn't join us (sarcastically). She instantly apologizes, says that if I had done the same thing with a female server she would be uncomfortable as well. 

The next day I thanked her for recognizing where I was coming from and apologizing. 

-----

Time for the good things. She always talks about how happy she is to be anywhere with me. Always says how I check everything off her list and more. We both are crazy about our conversations and really, really enjoy the sex. Her family is amazing and she gets along with my family as well. She's always supportive of me in every area of my life. We are always so genuinely excited to see each other and have such a real connection. 

She graduated in May. I get the impression that she was quite the flirt in college. I think she still hasn't broken old habits, and I'm trying to figure out if she's even trying.

TLDR:

- Met a girl, we have a genuine connection and things are going well.
- I leave town for a week, when I get back she says she needs more time for herself. I accommodate for a while.
- She sees her ex briefly on the street and sobs. I understand and dismiss it.
- I bring her to a show where she starts to dance with another dude. I jumped in before they actually started dancing. I bring it up afterwards and she says she was oblivious and thought it was me. 
- She invites our attractive male server to go smoke with us just because he was stressed. She apologizes right after and says she hates to see people stressed and always wants to help. 

A lot of the time she makes me feel great. Sometimes she makes me feel really, really shitty. I can easily explain away all the bad things, but I don't know if they are indicative of her character as a whole. Is it going to improve or not? Is this normal? Should I actually be concerned about the things I'm concerned about? Really just trying to see if my feelings are valid, and what I should do from there.

"The Midterm has Caused a Rift Between my Roommate (20M) and I (20M)


My roommate is a political science major and is black, yes this is relevant for reasons I’ll mention later. This midterm I chose not to vote due to both being busy with my many exams popping up and club activities. I also did not want to make an uneducated vote because I believe that puts unqualified people in office. Anyway fast forwarding to post results my roommates favored candidates did not win and he had several other friends over to view the results. They proceeded to comment about how if people had voted their candidate would have won and spent an hour talking about how people who don’t vote should be put in jail over people with possession charges and how they were the cause of all the political issues in the US. As well as discussing how all republicans were racist and bigots. This morning I woke up and he had posted that people who don’t vote are the worst and if you didn’t vote you weren’t allowed to speak to him because obviously you lost you’re right to have an opinion by not voting. I haven’t spoken to him yet but I don’t know how to go about calming down the political anger, another reason election time is never fun in my opinion. I understand his ancestors fought very hard for the right to vote but didn’t my ancestors fight for the freedom to choose whether or not to vote as well?

TLDR: I didn’t vote and roommate is pissed, causing a rift between us."

I am a male, bisexual, 23 years old, currently in my senior year in college. I met this guy (26 years old) back in July on Grindr in my college. He came here to do a one year certificate program. At first I was really hesitant about meeting him, but he really wanted to meet me. So, we did and he developed feelings for me.

I've had really bad experiences in the past, where I've gotten cheated multiples times. I was very happy single when this guy came into my life. 
I told him about my past experiences and he told me he would never be that asshole to me. He had told me he didn't like complications in relationships and he also doesn't like obligations or expectations. 
But I have a habit of self-sabotaging. This guy started talking to one of my friends on Grindr. He also asked my friend to meet him. My friend told me this and I got really angry and accused the guy of being a liar and being an asshole. He was really really angry at me and told me that I don't own him and that all the love that he had for me just died. Idk if it was anger because I know he really loved me even though we were not officially dating. 

I apologise to him, realising he had already told me not to expect anything. But he says he has put that side of him deep inside and that he is going to be very cautious around me. He also told me to control my feelings and not tell him again and again how much I like him. He also said that he would like to be with me after college, which is May 2019 for me and July 2019 for him. He said he will move to whatever city im in. 

I don't know what to do. People don't just move cities for others. I really like him and I feel like I've messed it up really bad. I really need advice. Please help me, I'd be very very grateful. I really need an objective point of view on this because all I've been doing is crying. Please help me"

"Best way to negotiate roommate(20sM), parent(60sM) who think they have any say in my life (20sF)?


Basically, I live with a roommate who I used to be romantically involved with. My single living parent lives down the street. It's a unique situation in that they let me make a lot of the decisions for both of them. I decide where and what we eat, which bills get paid and in what fashion, I even chose our houses. To be clear, though, this isn't me telling them what to do, it's them listening to my suggestions and recommendations. So, clearly, they trust my judgement.

&amp;#x200B;

Well, the other day, it came up from my father that he thinks poorly of me. I'm not sure why, but he does. I'm doing pretty well: self employed, putting myself through school with no debt, travelling internationally, paying all my own bills, saving a lot of money, and so on. I spoke to my ex/roommate briefly about it and was told the same. They both think I'm, in short, a joke. 

&amp;#x200B;

Recently, there was another shouting match about my relationships. My father went nuclear and accused me of having cheated on my ex and also went on a rant about how all of my friends aren't good enough for me and not the kind of people I should be hanging around with. Again, my ex/roommate chimed in to agree with him, though his perspective was more ""why wasn't I good enough for you and these people are"".

&amp;#x200B;

Before you ask, my ex/roommate &amp; I decided to continue living together due to legal reasons, not because we want to. At this time there's no end date in sight. It works pretty well most days. One of us is usually gone before the other even wakes up and is back after the other is asleep. We only have to see each other a few times each week.

&amp;#x200B;

So now the problem is... I'm kind of stuck with both of these people for different reasons. I'm not comfortable no longer speaking to my father even though he clearly doesn't respect me.

&amp;#x200B;

What's my best play here? I've already decided that I no longer share personal information with either of them. If they ask questions about where I was or who I was with, I just tell them that it's my private business and I don't want to share. That's already really irritated my father but I held my ground. I'm an adult, I don't have to tell him anything.

&amp;#x200B;

Big issue that is sparking me posting about this is that I've started seeing someone new. I already know exactly what my father will say. My ex/roommate hates this person just because I'm having them over to the house once or twice a week. Not sure if he's guessed that we're together, but he's not stupid and I expect him to figure it out. I don't think he'll tell my father.

&amp;#x200B;

So... what do I do with this? Just maintain ""my relationship is none of your business"" with both of them? Just repeat variations of that whenever they try to raise the topic? Say yes, this person and I are together, and I don't want your opinion about it?

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR: My father &amp; my ex are assholes who think they can tell me how to live my life, yell at me about my decisions, what's the best way to prevent WW3 over my new romantic relationship?"

"I [23 f] invited my college friends [Early 20s] to my family's rural home, and they were all pretty rude and judgemental


..

I think when they first saw the house, a little 2 bedroom place, that's pretty well-worn inside and out, they were pretty surprised, saying stuff like ""This is where you grew up?"". It was so obviously different than their own homes, even down to how I had air mattresses set up, rather than guest bedrooms.  

I showed them around, and when they saw my Dad's gun cabinet (locked, but with a glass front) Ally started talking about how, when she was a kid, her parents would never allow her to go to someone's house if they owned a gun. And Serena said her family was the same. It came off as kinda rude, like they were looking down on people who have guns as dangerous. I said something about how a lot of people around me would hunt, and having a few rifles was pretty standard. 

The next morning, they'd slept in but I woke up early and couldn't sleep. So I went outside to join my dad who was already chopping firewood. When my friends woke up a couple hours later, they were super taken aback to see me out there with an axe, and were worried I was going to hurt myself. I said that I'd been doing it since I was a kid, and that made them more concerned I think... That I'd be allowed to cut wood as a kid? IDK.

My parents suggested we go to the lake in our town, and offered to drive. My mom casually said that she could take us in the pickup, and us girls could ride in the back, because the road to the lake was a little rough on cars. Melissa said absolutely not, she wasn't riding in the back of a truck without a seat or seatbelt. which was her choice but she was just really rude about it. We ended up not going to the lake, because I thought the truck was the only vehicle with enough ground clearance to get there.

After the trip, Melissa said something pretty passive aggressive about how we all should have gone to her house, because she actually has enough beds. Even though she had been totally on board with coming to my hometown to have a bonfire party / weekend in nature kinda thing.

I don't know if this stuff is normal and I'm the weird one out, or if my friends were unnecessarily rude.

I don't know what to do except not invite them back.

TLDR - I invited my college friends to my hometown, they all said some stuff that made me feel bad about having come from a very different place than them.

The neighbor lady never speaks to me and only says hi to my hubby. I don’t like her. She asked him to cut a plant, he said yes. I’m telling him no. He looks uncomfortable but I don’t care.

"How much porn is too much?


My (24/f) boyfriend (27/m) and I have a pretty great relationship overall. I know he watches porn. He’s a great dude. I don’t care as long as I don’t see it - I just ask him to delete the browser history. I like porn too, but I usually only watch it if I haven’t seen him for awhile. 

We’ve been together a little under 3 years and have an active sex life. We don’t live together, but when we see each other, we have sex at least once a day. We see each other at least 4 days/week. We did use to have a problem where I felt like he was pressuring me for sex. He still does that, but is more respectful of me when I say no. Personally, for me, once a day is more than enough.

He’s a night owl, although lately, he’s been staying up til like 6 in the morning and then coming to bed. I got up around 10 today and got on his computer to check email and pay some student loans. 

Of course - and yes yes yes I know I’m the asshole, I typed in a website name and pornhub popped up. I got curious to see what kind of porn he was watching. 

Like I said, I don’t care that he was watching porn. He doesn’t watch anything scary or gross or ridiculous - but he was online last night watching porn from 2 - 6 am, and it looks like he’s been doing this for the past few nights. It also looks like when I’m at work, he’s watching porn. It seems like he watches it for several hours at a time on a daily basis. 

His sex drive is so high, I feel like I obviously don’t satisfy him. Like, the other night we had sex twice, and he still was online watching porn for hours. Is it normal for guys to watch that much porn?? 

TLDR; My boyfriend is staying up early into the morning watching porn when I’m in the room sleeping, and watches it for hours at a time when I’m at work. What should I do? Is this normal?"
"I (M19) want to buy multiple gifts and arrange it in a neat gift bag for a past really really close friend (F17) and give it to her for her birthday but there’s a catch...


So I don’t really want to go into details because it’s complicated and a long story and something that I believe really only her and I can truly understand what happened but this girl and I were very good friends for about 6 months. We spent almost everyday hanging out whether it be for a bit or the whole day and when we weren’t together we were texting. We told each other everything and her and I shared a lot of very deep secrets that neither of us would want getting out. We were extremely close and even shared a fair share of “I love yous” in a platonic way. 

About 2 months ago a lot happened and she decided that she “didn’t want to have friends anymore” and “wanted to focus on her grades and then leave our state.” She is in her senior year of high school and she said we both had to move on and understand that our friendship was done. It’s a long story how it lead up to this and is very confusing but just understand how close we were before and we haven’t talked or really seen each other at all since about 2 months ago. 

Her birthday is coming up December 14th. I really wanted to find a way to reconnect even a little bit just so we stay somewhat friends after she moves on to college and stuff and even if it doesn’t reconnect us I just really wanted to do something nice for her. I have a list of things she’s wanted, necklaces, bracelets, this blanket called The Comfy and some other stuff and I wanted to order it all and arrange it in a cute back and give it to her on her birthday. 

So now to the question, this is a very odd and unique situation but ladies of reddit if you were in her situation and the guy did this for you would you be happy and grateful or would it make you maybe mad at him or hold resent towards him because the last thing I want is her getting mad at me for doing this. 

Help me out reddit!

"Me [30M] Deciding To Quit Masturbation Because Of Using Many People, Any Advice / Commentary?


**Short version:** 

When you were young did you decide to stop fapping a lot, or have rarely done it since then? Have you basically given that up almost or like forever, if so, at what age did you decide?

**Long Version:**

First off, does anyone here NOT masturbate or rarely, like ever? Like did you decide to not do that when you were young and rarely have ever since, etc? 

You may not agree with my beliefs but here we go... 

Okay I was basically a sex addict longest time, lots of bar hopping, wild times, very unhealthy relationships using eachother. I probably masturbated away my youth like a million times in my life time prior to this. I eventually got addicted to lesbian pornography, lost many important real relationships, my job and finances, I had to quit that. Long road. I made it. Sort of. 

Progress.

I am now gotten my self control willpower to be able to stay away from porn and casual ""just-want-to-use-you-for-sex-like-a-drug-and-chuck-you"" encounters but I still feel this feeling of deep regret in my soul when I masturbate, each time after. I feel so horrible after doing it. I feel so tired and my voice gets all weak and hollow and I feel that I am an adult so I think it might be a very boyish thing to do that’s passable as a kid but as you get older it just feels humiliating and isolating and weird. I can’t find any positive view about it honestly. I always feel like shit when I do it. Anxious angry afraid isolative weak and depressed. Orgasm takes a hell lot out of a man. I think God intentionally created the penis for vagina, not the hand. And that whole orgasm thing is meant to be shared with another loving caring human being partner. Right? Anyone else give this sh!t up? 

So, it's destroying my life, self esteem, confidence, romantic life, social life, I’m ready.

Do you guys think I should make “the ultimate sacrifice” and take a vow to never fap again? 

I am sick of feeling like shit after and having to like hide away from people after and just sick and tired all the time.

IS there like some great thing that adult men just unspokenly have given that behavior up a long time ago? OR probably every grown adult man in real relationships and great social life DOES probably masturbates privately in like the shower and stuff very often? OR not at all? 

Also, to deal with urges I’m going single for a while because I have a lot of stuff to deal with and financially in a terrible spot and many loose ends I am not ready to bring a woman into my life right now. I really need the space.

This is why it might be tough for me to quit. But I can do it. If that's the goal.

It probably needs to be, right? I'm dying here. I look and feel horrible after I masturbate: excessive sex is like the quick road to the grave. 

What do you think dudes? Can anyone here share similar experiences with this over their lifetime? Did you choose to give it up, walk away, feel life is better without it? Any tips for giving it up? What age did you decide to be free of it? Should I just keep saying no until it gets easier, and go out there and find real love and connection, only, ever, done?

"Girl[23F] I'm [26M] falling for wants some time to think


Hi everyone.

I started dating this girl two months ago, and right from the first date we hit it off marvelously. I know she ended a long relationship a month before we started dating, however, she ended it with him because the guy suffered from chronic depression.

Anyways, everything was great. We texted every day. I met her whole family and friends at her graduation party two weeks ago and I felt it was becoming very official. Though about a week and a half ago she started becoming distant, and after a couple of days she said we should take it a bit slower, chill for a while. We had just started having sex, she was worried we didn't use protection that couple of times. She asked for forgiveness because she was really distant that week, thinking about how she had never had been that intimate with a guy who wasn't in a serious relationship with her. (She didn't expect to fall for me when we started dating, which I translate as she didn't mean to be that serious when we started) I understood her position completely, so we resolved to take it slower, probably not have sex for a while ( which I was really cool with).

So after that discussion, we met again on Thursday night (two days after the conversation), had a couple of beers with friends. While taking a cab to take her home, she said she would rather go home with me and be together. We obviously had sex ( I was confused since we had just discussed taking it slower), again unprotected. Anyhow, I took her home after and everything was ""normal"".

The next day, I had bought her concert tickets to see her favorite band. She called me in the afternoon REALLY worried about having had unprotected sex, and I told that we should handle the situation calmly the next day and enjoy the concert. Let me tell you, I have NEVER had such a great time with someone I was dating as that night. We went to eat, then to the concert, then to have some beers, and then to a party. She even uploaded a picture with me on Instagram and Facebook.

Anyway, we left the party, I was taking her home...and while in the cab we got horny again and obviously went to my place. We were both really on to it, and BOTH of us didn't care about a condom. The next day, she said she was really disappointed in me because I didn't respect her wishes for protected sex (I did NOT force her in any way, we both wanted it at the moment because we were REALLY drunk). I told her it wasn't my intention to disrespect her, it was a spur of the moment kind of thing. She said she needed time to think about that big step she took with me, and that she loved me.

I am at a loss with what to do. I know the correct thing to do is to not text her or call her at all until she looks for me, but I really feel I should write to her in 4 or 5 days to tell her I haven't forgotten about her and I'm here if she needs me. Or should I tell her to meet? Or should I just assume it's over?

I am sad, it is the first girl I've fallen for in a really long time and I don't want to screw it.

Thanks for any advice.

P.S. She has always been that perfect preppy kind of girl whose parents adore her and consider her to be perfect. She has always been with guys who are not like me, lawyers and guys who really don't seem to be like me. I say this because I am no her usual choice of guy, with tattoed sleeves and such, I work as an artist and a programmer. I guess she is confused because she is with someone who brought a lot of new elements in her life and she is trying to handle it.

"The best way to separate from my (26) incredibly judgemental and negative friend (34)?


Last July, I relocated across the country with my boyfriend. We have made the decision to move back home and are in the process of packing with plans to leave in a few weeks. Since living here, I made a friend at work, let's call her M. Through M, I began spending time with her friend, A. We would hang out together as a trio and separately.  A has always been someone who I was on the fence about. She is very difficult to work with. She is incredibly negative and overshares to everyone. She talks nonstop about her ""perfect"" relationship and complains nonstop about her financial situation, having to be at work, how tired she is, etc. This is just a few examples of what we have to listen to.

I always kind of accepted her as an interesting character, but over time I have come to realize that it feels like she has zero interest in my life. My time with her has started to feel like a therapy session in a sense. I constantly need to validate her relationship and hear how perfect her boyfriend is, and I need to commiserate with her about how tired she is and how much she hates being at work. Meanwhile, I have come to a place where I don't feel comfortable sharing details of my life (like if my boyfriend and I get into a tiff and I just want to vent about it) because I genuinely feel (and now know) that she judges me for it.

For a while now, A has complained about M's boyfriend, saying how she doesn't like him and that she doesn't think they will last long term. M is happy and in love with her boyfriend and I think he is a genuinely nice guy. A has an opinion about everything. Recently, I realized that she must have said similar things about me behind my back. M and I have been talking about conversations we have had with A when the other was not around. I was hurt, torn, and mostly furious when I heard that A had said something along the lines that I ""probably won't end up with my boyfriend (of nearly four years) and that if I do stay with him, I will regret it."" She has also minimized my goal to apply to a competitive graduate program, and thinks I'm making a mistake by moving home. She is so quick to judge my life when I don't feel that she is someone I would ever go to for life advice. I genuinely feel that she doesn't know me that well at all and especially doesn't know my boyfriend to make judgement calls about my goals, life decisions, and who I want to date.

I have a lot of inner turmoil over this situation because I have reached a place where all I feel is resentment towards her. We do get along and have good times (I know good times don't mean much in this relationship). She has made comments about coming to visit me when I am home and this stresses me out. I would NEVER allow her in OUR home in the state where were are going (that I made a mistake moving to according to her) with the boyfriend (who I will regret staying with, according to her). The thought of her visiting me makes me want to throttle her. In two weeks when we leave, I have no desire to contact her or ever seeing her again. I don't want to be her friend, but I don't know how to pull away. I feel this overwhelming ""how dare she?!"" feeling with regard to my boyfriend and a need to defend his honor and chew her out over it. I don't want her to think that she can speak this way about people and expect to have quality relationships. Another part of me thinks ""what is the point?"". 

This is all complicated by M still having to work with her. I, luckily, get to be separated physically by distance. M and I know details because we've shared what A has said, and bringing up the comment about my boyfriend would throw M under the bus and make her life more difficult at work. M is getting tired of her antics as well, but isn't ready to confront her over it because she doesn't want to make it weird at her job. Part of me feels like ghosting her is a cop out, but I don't think confronting her would ultimately change how she feels and acts. I don't know what to do. I am angry, fed up, and irritated over the things she has said to tear others down in order to build herself up. Any advice for me? For M?

**tldr: a ""friend"" that I met through my mutual friend at work is judgmental, insecure, and negative. I am moving across the country in a few weeks and grappling with my desire to tell her off vs ghost her. Telling her off would throw our mutual friend (who will still have to work with her) under the bus and make things weird between them. What is the best route for separating from a toxic person?**"
"How can I (28f) put myself in the mood and initiate sex more often with my boyfriend (28m)?


My boyfriend of almost two years and I have sex on average like 1-2 times a week. Lately it feels like it’s been less frequent. 

In the last month, his living situation has changed, his landlord sold the condo he was living in and he had to move into his parents house that is much further from me/downtown. I really don’t mind this because he gets to save money and spend more time with me at my place since I live closer to his work. 

The problem is, I have a small twin size bed that he is too tall for. We fit, but it’s a bit tight. I also have a pull-out couch that is more spacious, but less comfortable for his back. As a result, neither beds are comfortable for sex. I don’t want to buy a new bed because it’s expensive and I want the next bed I buy to be the bed I have for the rest of my life which means I want to wait until I buy my own place/move somewhere more permanent. 

I also tend to fall asleep earlier than him. I’m used to sleeping around 10-11pm and waking up around 6-7am whereas if he is more like, sleep at 12-1am, wake up at 9-10am.

And I’ll admit I noticed my sex drive isn’t as high as when I was in my early 20s. He doesn’t complain about the amount of times we have sex, but sometimes I wish we could be having it more. I just don’t know how to initiate it in a sexy way or how to force myself to physically feel that drive even though in my head I want to. I also don’t know how to feel and show a sexier side of me. 

Is there anything I can do to put myself and in the mood and initiate sex more? 

TL;DR
I want to have sex with my boyfriend more frequently. But I lack the feeling sexiness and need help initiating, let alone putting myself in the mood.

"Should I (25F) be there for and support a guy (24M) I've only been seeing for 4 months?


So, I've been seeing this guy for about 4 months now. He lives in a city 1 hour away and he's come to visit me a few times and I've gone to see him also. When we first met he was super confident and would text me all the time. I wasn't that into him to begin with but he was pretty consistent and I really liked that about him because a lot of guys I've dated recently would be really inconsistent. 

&amp;#x200B;

About 3 weeks ago though I start hearing less from him. It switches to be being the one instigating conversation and asking to see him. He was supposed to come visit around this time but when I asked him about it he said he'd come the next day. When it got to the next day I didn't hear from him and when I asked him he said he was with family and won't be able to make it. 

Then out of the blue after a week of not speaking he messages me saying that every now and then this happens to him. He becomes overwhelmed with stress and feels like he won't be a success and that he has so many people that don't believe in him and it gets him really down. He said that he tends to close himself off to people who care about him. I replied with lots of nice things to say but then get no reply. At this point I was frustrated because I didn't know what all this meant for us. I liked him and wanted to see where it would go if anywhere. So I messaged him saying I wanted to be mature and now what he wants. He replied saying 'I was letting you know where my heads at but if you don't want to be around or want to do your thing theres nothing I can say.' He goes on to say he can't choose for me and that if I don't want to continue he can't stop me. I ask what he wants and he says 'I'm not the one with the problem ask yourself. I like you so I want to know.' I tell him I like him too but that it confuses me because he flakes and doesn't message anymore so I don't know where I stand. He then says he understands and what do I want to do. I say I want some consistency and he doesn't reply lol.

&amp;#x200B;

He then deleted all of his social media. I felt slightly worried to be honest because without seeing him active on social media it made me feel like he'd just disappeared. I messaged him saying 'hope ur ok' but didn't get a response. I messaged again last week to check he was ok because I was still worried as I know he struggles to talk about his emotions. He replied this time and said thank you for understanding because not many people do and that he hasn't stopped thinking about me. He then messages me this weekend just gone saying he might come to my city because his friends are coming for an event but he doesn't want to go he wants to see me. But then his friend finishes work super late and isn't driving anymore so he can't come. He says he will try and come see me next week - which is now this week. 

&amp;#x200B;

SO I've been reading these tweets recently that say men who are down or don't have their shit together will ditch the women who stick by and support them during this time the moment they get better and go for the women that they always wanted. I feel conflicted because obviously we're not in a relationship and we don't know each other that well so i shouldn't care as much as I do. But I am a really caring person and I do care for him despite how short a time we've known each other. Also if he sees me being supportive maybe he'll want to be with me, dumb I know. But on the other hand I want to be the girl he wants when he's up and doing good. But then when we first met he was up and doing good? I mean this guy is successful financially and is on a good route to success so its not like he's a broke nobody you know?

&amp;#x200B;

tl;dr,A guy I've been seeing for 4 months has been going through some stuff. He let me know about this but its been unclear whether or not he wants to continue because he's not interested in me anymore or because he's dealing with this stuff. He's cut himself off from the world so I don't know if its something he'll come out of and then come back to me or if I should just leave him be for good. I care about him and want to help him but I don't want to look like I care too much because then he won't like me anymore. Its so confusing and I don't know what 'game' to play here. I hate playing games but from all my friends who have men constantly pine for them - the less interested you are the more they seem to want you and I want him to want me. I really want to see him this week and I don't know whether to message him asking him to come or just asking how he is? Do I look too desperate? Will it make him not want me? 

Also if you think I should move on how do I do this because I keep thinking about him and wanting so badly to hug him I can't get it out my head and I don't know what to do

"I think my [21F] boyfriend [41M] is way too close with his daughter [17F]


So I've been dating this man for six months now. Things are getting pretty serious between us and we have been talking about getting married next spring. He's kind, funny, charming, strong, handsome, and financially stable. He's a divorcee of eight years, with five kids from his previous marriage. His four oldest moved out, but his youngest, a 17 year old girl, still lives with him. 

We decided that his daughter should get to know me, so he invited me for dinner at his house. It was the first time I've ever been in his house. So, we go to his house, and he introduces me to his daughter. He told her that I'm a ""woman \[he's\] seeing"". She was friendly enough. We had dinner, talked, and watched TV before he drove me home. We all had a good time. But there's a little problem.

Please know I'm not accusing him of doing anything inappropriate. But the way he acts with his daughter is just... unsettling. I may be overreacting, but their behavior creeps me out. 

First of all, the girl does not act her age. I'm not trying to be insulting, but she acts more like a girl than an almost-adult. She constantly giggles, calls her father ""Daddy"", and whines and pouts, at least jokingly, when she does not get her way. Her speech is very simple and I had difficulty holding a deep conversation with her. 

His behavior is also strange. It's hard to describe it, but he seems very possessive of her. He constantly called her ""my daughter"" or ""my girl"". He even refers to her in the third person like that. 

That's not the creepiest part, though. I noticed that they are constantly touching each other. She hugs him constantly. He strokes her hair and tousles it. He'll have his arm around her shoulders or waist whenever they're standing near each other, and vice versa. When we watched television after dinner, we sat on the couch. The couch has three seats. He sat at the end, I sat in the middle next to him. You'd think the daughter would sit at the other end. But no, his daughter, without a word, sat right down on his lap. He wrapped his arm around her, and the other one over my shoulders. They acted like this was completely normal. I was actually shocked for a few minutes. Then when we were about to leave, we kissed on the lips. His daughter pouts and says ""where's my kiss?"". My boyfriend kissed her on the cheek and then we left. 

I just don't know what to think of this. I don't want to accuse him of being a pervert or anything, but I have never seen anything like that. I grew up in a house that wasn't that physically affectionate, however. Am I overreacting? I really want to have a discussion about this with him, but I don't want to offend. Any help would be appreciated.

tl;dr: My boyfriend and his daughter are extremely close and I find it weird. Am I overreacting? How do I talk to him about this?

"(23f) deeply disturbed by partners (25m) anal fetish


BF and I have been in a monogamous relationship for a few years now. We love each other a great deal and are actively working towards building a life together for the future. I would like to consider myself an open-minded and sex-positive individual but BF continues to share pieces of his fetish history with me that are deeply disturbing and leave me rattled and borderline traumatized. I always feel like I'm over-reacting and hate being confrontational about it because they don't seem very harmful, except maybe to himself. I know that anal play is a growing phenomenom and many couples partake in the activity together, but BF often divulges instances where he has done anal play with himself (also okay), but these secrets leave me panicked and shaken and unable to function.

For example, there have been instances where a toy has arrived in the mail that is larger than anything I have ever been in close contact with. One instance, a purple ""alien"" cock arrived in the mail and I LOST it. Hysterical. We've been trying actively to work through this issue together - currently his toys remain at my house (because the idea of him using them leaves me so disturbed and he's trying to make me comfortable and prove he doesn't need/want them). I actively try and commit to engaging in his fetish by incorporating pegging and anal play into our sex life. This part does not disturb me. What disturbs me is stories like my BF putting candy, fruits/vegetables, large objects and other random things in his rectum. This cannot be healthy! I have suggested therapy and he doesn't believe he has an issue. I am so disturbed by it that I seek therapy for it so that I can destress after he divulges details to me. It leaves me so rattled. I'm shaking as I type this.

I know I should be more compassionate, we all have weird kinks that get us off and things we enjoy that others might not. I am happy that he has spent his adolescence experimenting, but I am also so disturbed by his stories and the idea of him pleasuring himself this way... I don't know if it will be the thing that destroys our relationship or not. It puts me under so much stress and anxiety, is it worth continuing to build a future with someone who leaves me feeling this way? I've tried just lightening up about it but it is such a knee-jerk reaction, I have no control over it and it ruins my productivity for days at a time. I have no idea why I am so disturbed or if I can ever overcome it.

I love my partner so much, he's a great man, but I can't shake how disturbed I feel about his kinks. What do I do?

TD;LR My boyfriend has a life-long anal fetish that he doesn't believe warrants therapy and that I find very disturbing, but I love him despite and can't figure out what to do - can this be overcome or will it be the thing that drives us apart?"
"2 months into a new relationship and I’m on cloud nine


For the last year I was in an incredibly toxic and dramatic relationship. We broke up, got back together, my heart got broken, I was depressed, I went crawling back even though I new I shouldn’t have. 
2 months ago I met a new guy. He’s sweet and kind and completely drama free. We click very naturally and just have a blast when we are together. Who knows what will happen, but it just feels so damn refreshing to be in a relationship with no drama. I’m not constantly being dragged down by someone else, and struggling to pick up the pieces only to get pushed back down. 

I’m just really excited because I finally feel like I’m moving forward. Thought I’d share with everyone who feels like they are in a never ending circle. "
"I [44M] am considering leaving my wife after revealing my financial success to her [44F]


 

(Repost, original got taken down for some reason))

Not sure how much this will help me with my situation, but I feel like I need to get this off my chest, and have no one to talk to. I am a self made millionaire (net worth 13.2 million CAD), and I have kept my wealth a secret from my wife (and parents/siblings) for the last 20 years (not in a deceitful way, keep reading to understand why). I recently decided it was time to let her know about my net worth, and her attitude towards me/our marriage has completely changed.

To give some context, around 20 years ago, my wife (then girlfriend) and I graduated college. We entered the workforce, I as an electrical engineer, she as a nurse. We were both living at home, with our respective parents during this time. We were both pretty frugal people, and we were trying to save up enough money to where we could possibly put a down payment on a house together. Anyways, after about 2-3 years of working and saving, I proposed to her, she said yes, and we start planning our wedding. During these past years however, I started doing some research about investing in the stock market, and I sort of came to the realization that it would probably serve me better to invest my money rather than have it sit in the bank and depreciate in value, which is what both my wife and I were doing at the time. I changed my mind about wanting to purchase a home, and thought it would be better to rent a place together and invest our money in the markets.

When I told my wife about this, she was rather upset. She always wanted to own a home, and she thought investing was a huge gamble that may result in us losing all our money. I was insistent on investing while she was not, so we came to an agreement that we would keep all of our finances separate, and split the shared bills (rent/food/utilities, etc) 50/50. She also wanted to get a prenup, which I agreed to ( I didn't really want to get a prenup at the time, but I wasn't really against it either, as at the time we made a similar income). I began trading part time, investing the 100k or so I had at the time, and she kept her money separate, contributing to her retirement fund. She definitely did not like my decision to ""gamble"" with my money, so we agreed that we would not speak of our separate finances, and that I would not tell her how much I made/lost. Fast forward about 20 years, and I've done quite well for myself. My current portfolio is 13.2 million CAD. I quit my job about 12 years ago once I started making very good returns, and started trading full time. My wife was skeptical of me quitting my job, but I assured her I was making enough to pay our bills and then some, so eventually she accepted it.

Anyways, after two decades of living frugally and building my wealth, I decided just a couple months ago that it was time to let her and my other loved ones in on my financial situation. Even though we agreed to not speak of our individual finances all those years ago, I figured it was time. So I let her know the news, and at first she didn't believe me, but after assuring her/showing her the necessary paperwork, she finally believes me. At first she seems rather speechless, and still dumbfounded at the same time. Then I let her know that I wanted to buy my parents a big, fancy house (in the range to 2-3 million) and give them a 1 million vacation fund so that they could travel the world, to pay them back for everything they've done for me, and her attitude completely changed.

She started saying that I shouldn't be spending that much on other people, and that it wouldn't be wise to buy a house for someone else when we did not own a home ourselves. I told her that I'd already made up my mind about purchasing my parents a home, then she starts saying it's not my call, and that since we've been married for so long that the money should belong to both of us. This came out of nowhere, as our whole marriage we had agreed to keep our finances separate (in fact, this is what she wanted). I reminded her of our arrangement, and she starts freaking out about how she's made so many sacrifices for me, even though we've paid for the bills 50/50 since the start of our marriage. We fight for awhile, and eventually go to bed.

The next morning, we sort of make up, and go about our days. About a week later, she tells me she wants to quit her job and retire early. To be honest, this is not a problem to me, and I was actually going to suggest she reduce her hours before we started fighting the prior week. So she quits her job, and now is where the real problems start. Out of nowhere, she starts buying all sorts of extravagant clothing and jewelry. I asked her how she is paying for this, and she said she is taking money from her retirement fund. When I asked her, ""don't you need that money for the future?"" she said that since I'm making so much, she figured I'd fund our retirement so there's no need to worry about her account. I let her know that I don't mind her quitting her job, and I'd be happy to fund our retirement, but that I was not okay with her buying all this extravagant garbage that we don't need. She started whining and saying that we could afford it, and that it was her money anyways so I have no say in the matter. Then I said, ""well why should I share my money with you if you're going to go and spend all your money on frivolous items that you don't need?"", and then she starts freaking out again about how we should now join our accounts, and that all our money should be shared.

It's been like this for the last few weeks, and she keeps on buying more and more stuff. I straight up asked to see her credit card statements, and over the last 3 weeks she's spent over $23,000. Not to mention all this time, she's trying to talk me out of buying my parents a house and giving them a vacation fund. I fear that she'll keep on spending like this, and that eventually she won't be able to pay for it, so she'll start trying to get money from me.

I grew up very modestly. My parents weren't poor, but we definitely struggled financially when i was a kid. I grew up with a very frugal mindset, and I have always been very minimalistic. I thought my wife was the same way, as she's always seemed to be fairly good with her money, until these last few weeks. I feel like she's abusing the fact that I am well off, and that she figures if she keeps spending like this eventually I'll bail her out. Every time I try to talk to her about our situation she starts getting defensive and won't have a reasonable conversation. I didn't get to where I was by spending money on stupid shit, and in the next few years I'd like to turn my 13.2 million into even more, but that's not going to happen if I have to start footing an expensive shopping habit.

I am seriously considering leaving her if this behavior continues. I love her, but I can't support this kind of behavior. This shitty part is I don't know how airtight our prenup is, and I made all my money after we got married, so there's a good chance she might get half of everything I have (still have to look into this with my lawyer if it comes to it). I'm not really sure what I should do... Looking for any advice or opinions from anyone who is willing to put in their two cents...

\------

**TL;DR; : My wife and I decided to keep our finances completely separate and not speak of our finances to each other at the beginning of our marriage. I've since accumulated a net worth of 13.2 million dollars and have told my wife about it after our 20 years of marriage. She doesn't seem to be taking it well, and I am considering leaving her because of her frivolous spending.**"
"My [21M] girlfriend [20F] argued with me bacause I was sad for a suicide victim. Is she a narcisist?


So, we've been together for 9 months now, and I've already made a few posts about her on this sub before. 

I'll try to explaing as short as I can, so sorry if come out as a long text.

In the past couple months, she is being very egocentric. Everytime I try to talk to her about the important things, like, sex life, finances and things like that, she get really angry and we argue.   


We only see each other 1 time a week, and when we do, she spents most of the time on her phone, discussing politics on social media, and get angry when I complain about it. She never does things to me, and I do from hell to earth for her, and I don't see 20% of that coming back my way. Everything has to be about her. She doesn't ask about my friends, she doesnt ask about my day. She NEVER goes to my place, I am always the one who gotta go to her place. And if I take the day off to spend with my squad, she goes into rage mode. There's more of this, but, I'll keep it short.

3 days ago, a person who I knew from afar, commited suicide. We weren't exactly friends, but I liked her, she was a nice, sweet person. So, naturally, I got really sad about it. I am struggling with depression myself, and see someone I used to know just go like this...its horrible.

Anyway, I was sad about it, of course, and I told my GF how I was feeling. She goes like ""Nah. Shit happens, everybody gotta die sometime."" and proceed to change subject to talk about a dress she want to buy. I get upset over this, of course. So I gave her the cold shoulder for a couple hours, and she gets really angry, tell me that she is thinking about get things over with me because ""I barely knew her"", I am being "" dramatic"" and that I am ""caring more about a dead girl than I do for her"".

How to proceed with this?   
Sorry for the wall text

tl;dr

Grilfriend is very self-centred and we had and argument about her lack of empathy for calling a close suicide victim a ""dead girl"""

"Should I 30 [M] be curious about why my GF [22F] of 7 months did not get me anything for me birthday?


Some backdrop - my GF and I are very much in love... I am a young 30 she is a mature 21... and she is literally perfect and we are very much both in love with one another.

&amp;#x200B;

She currently is in law school and has a very heavy load of classes and most of her time is spent on homework and school stuff, so I can understand that she is very busy and getting a gift or just a simple card may not have been on her mind or a priority for her.

&amp;#x200B;

On the flip side, she knew my Bday has been coming up for quite some time, and she always orders stuff on Amazon, so I feel like if she actually cared, she could have just got something small, to show a bit of effort - she knows I do not require ANYTHING for my Bday, I can buy mostly whatever I want, but I thought she would be a bit more excited since its the first year of our relationship.

&amp;#x200B;

She called me this AM and told me ""please don't be mad but I haven't gotten you anything for your birthday, I promise I will make it up to you""  


That is fine.. NP, I don't care about the gift, I don't care what she actually gets.... I am just confused because there has been plenty of time to do/get something small if anything and it wasn't in her mind. Maybe I am different... Should I care?

&amp;#x200B;

Does this mean I may not be a priority to her in her mind? Any insight would be helpful.

&amp;#x200B;

tldr; GF didn't get me a card or a small gift for my Bday and I am curious if this means I may not be as important to her as she is to me.

I know this is not the place to talk about this stuff

But no other relative subreddit is replying,

It's regarding diet, but i need an urgent and educated reply


So if anyone has time to message me,

Or a subreddit i can post my question on."
"My (23f) ex-boyfriend (27m) of 3 years broke up with me last Thursday. it destroyed me because it was out of the blue. Now he says he misses me and made a huge mistake. Do I take him back? I love him so much but feel ""kicked around"" by him.


I'm not sure what tag to put this under. I guess it's technically a relationship question since IF we do get back together I'm asking more about the long term ramifications as opposed to the specifics of the breakup. I hope this is correct. 

So I have been with my boyfriend ""Jake"" for 3 years. We met when he was in his third year of medical school but I fell for him SO hard it's not even funny. I stuck with him through 2 very hard years of school, and he's now in his first year of residency. We had what I thought was a perfect relationship and I love him so much it literally hurts to be away from him (which just because of his school, we've had to endure a lot of away time). We talked often about getting married and I even got pregnant and despite it not being the ideal time, we agreed to keep the baby (I had a pretty devastating miscarriage, this was a year ago). So we have been through thick and thin with each other but we were always supportive, communicative, loving, helpful, etc... I literally can't imagine my life without him. 


So Thursday of last week I got a call from him that he wanted to have dinner. The date was pretty close to the miscarriage and I thought maybe he wanted to get together and talk and catch up about the year anniversary I underwent the miscarriage. He specifically told me in advance this wasn't a ""happy"" date, rather he had something he needed to talk about. 


We met at the restaurant and it wasn't five minutes in that he started in on the ""its not you, its me"" BS and ""you'll find someone who will be better to you than I could."" I was stunned. Like I roach could have crawled out of his nose and I would have been less stunned than I was. I didn't know whether to throw my water in his face or throw up. I tried to talk but couldn't find the words. I think I asked him if he met someone else. I think he said no. I said I had to leave. He begged me to stay. I said no and I went and cried in the parking lot in my car for at least an hour. I also threw up out the window several times. I honestly don't even remember driving home. 


He texted and called me several times over the next few days and all were basically ""I'm so sorry, but this is for the best. But I want to make sure you're ok."" I resisted the almost irresistible urge to call him and beg him to take me back and up until this morning I had not responded to any of his texts. I spent the last week either catatonic at work and in class or curled up in my bed crying until there were no liquids left in my body. I have never hurt like this in my life. Hence I say being ""kicked around.""


Well this morning my ring went off and I honestly thought it was an amazon package so I went to the door rather than answering it on my phone as I usually would. It was ""Jake."" He asked to come in. I must have looked like a true crazy person but I said ok and my heart truly skipped a beat just to be in his presence again. 


He basically said that he'd made a huge mistake and he'd missed me more than he ever thought was possible and he only broke up with me because he's having a much harder time in his residency than he thought and he thought maybe if he had no outside distractions he would have an easier time. He basically begged me to get back together with him. 


All I wanted to do was say yes but my rational, exhausted from too much emotion already, brain just told him I had to go to class and would talk to him later about it. He looked very dejected and left and it was all I could do to not chase him down and drag him back inside. 


So with all that...what do I do here? I love him so much I can hardly stand it. I can't imagine him not being in my life. I think he's being honest about his reasons for breaking up...but he alone made me feel like shit for a week. He did this to me, unannounced and unnecessarily. If he would have just had an honest discussion with me about stress he's under I would have made any arrangement to take stress of him. But he didn't do that, he basically kicked me in the face for no reason. 

Do I take him back? Do I say that I should never be with someone who will make me feel like he did this past week? IF we get back together what stipulations to I place on him? Do I even want to be in a relationship with stipulations?

Is it normal to still feel terrible sometimes after a break up that happened 6 months ago? I got dumped after 4 years of being with him and he never contacted me afterwards. He still said he loved me up until he broke it off, as well as still having sex with me. He blocked me on Facebook but then unblocked me a few months later...what would that even mean? Sucks so bad. What did you guys do to get over a horrific break up?

It’s just so difficult because I loved him so much...and to be dumped out of no where after all the time it still kills me, and he never asked to see how I was afterwards knowing how heartbroken I was...wtf. He also gave me a promise ring and few months prior.

I’ve gone from the intensity to the questioning.
I wonder if he’s smart enough for me, if I’m getting too irritable/ judging him too much?
And I feel guilty.
What attracted me to him was his big heart, and easy communication. He was smart in different ways than me, he forced me to think I’m totally different ways and has made me 1000 times more comfortable with who I am.

I had a very long on again off again dramatic relationship before this for years, and this is much steadier; which is new to me...

I’m going to try to be as concise as possible without revealing too much info. This guy and I work for the same company, but in different departments.

We are very compatible and I thought we were developing a great friendship based on mutual respect and similar ambitions. We both agreed we didn’t want anything serious which I am fine with. The second time we hung out we had oral sex. A few days after this, he asked me to hangout Sunday , not fully concrete plans but tentative. Sunday came and I didn’t hear from him. No big deal to me, he got busy. But now it’s Wednesday and this guy has been interacting with me on instagram , liking and commenting on my stuff, looking at my stories. But still no sorry or explanation about blowing me off Sunday. He also offered to take me somewhere this coming Sunday and he hasn’t confirmed that either. Should I say something? Honestly, this would annoy me if it was anyone I thought I was building a friendship with. Because it’s just rude and really confusing to me since he expressed a lot of interest and respect for me before (and yes, even after we fooled around).  What should I do?

"My friend [26M] who I [22F] secretly dated briefly has been drinking a lot since I started seeing a new guy. I'm worried about him. How can I make sure he's okay?


I [22F] met Tim [26M] in January, we became close friends by May, June-July we hung out and slept together. We were each others' first below the belt experiences. In July I became a part of his friend group [28F, 30F, and 28M]; they did not know about Tim and I's relationship. 

In August, Tim &amp; I had the DTR and both of us decided we didn't want to jeopardize friendships. We both admitted we had strong feelings for one another, but it just wouldn't work right now. We decided to go back to being friends and ""see if it goes anywhere"". We slept together a couple more times. 

September, Tim worked all month and I didn't hear from him. I kept trying to make plans, but he was always busy and never initiated. He rarely even texted back. I was hurt, but moved on. Our friends never found out about any of this- sleeping together, calling it off, me moving on. They have and had NO IDEA. 

Early October, I meet Mark [24M]. We start talking, move to dating pretty quick. Things are going good. My friends know about Mark, because they were with me when I met him. 

At a friend dinner in October, they start asking me about Mark. Tim is listening and clearly starts to feel hurt. Excuses himself from the room. Comes back and starts pounding drinks. 

I've seen Tim a handful of times since then. Each time, he's getting drunk, talking about the last time he was drunk, or planning on getting drunk. He wasn't like this when we were together. 

Tonight I talked with our friend Talia [28F] and said I was worried about Tim. She said she agrees, and said, ""something must have happened in the last couple of months because he's been on a downwards spiral. Nobody can get him to talk, though. He says he's fine, but clearly, something's hurting him."" He even told Talia he doesn't want to do this anymore, but he just keeps doing it.

I know there are a lot of things that could have caused this. But I also saw a direct correlation between his drinking and our relationship ending (he started to drink more frequently then) and my new relationship starting (now he's getting blackout drunk every week at least). 

I'm scared he's lonely and struggling and he can't even go to his friends because our relationship was a secret. In their eyes, he's Mr. Never-Gonna-Get-Attached, partly because Talia really likes him too and he doesn't want to hurt her. I'm scared he's hurting himself by drinking this much, and he doesn't have ways to cope. I'm really scared for him.

Honestly, I'm scared I hurt him and caused him to hurt himself this way because we took it too far and never really got closure.

I want to give him closure, I want to be able to talk to him, but I'm not even sure that would help. I want to make sure he's okay. I don't know if that's my place anymore. 

How can I help him? 

**Tl;dr** 
Dated/slept with friend for 2-3 months, our friend group never found out. Decided to just be friends with potential so we didn't rush and hurt friends/ourselves. He was flaky, I moved on but didn't give him finality. Then I started dating someone new. Since then, he's been drinking to blackout with frequency. I'm concerned for him, especially since he's unable to discuss this situation with our friends, who usually help him cope.

"My [23F] Boyfriend [28M] hates my mother[55F]


Ok, I'll try to make this short. My mom has what I think is Borderline Personality Disorder. If not that, then a whole mess of something else. Shes been extremely verbally abusive and occasionally physically abusive for most of my childhood. then turns around and acts like she did nothing wrong and that shes innocent and loves me. She would threaten to send me to an orphanage and would tell me I'm a loser and have to friends ect when I was like 10. Shes extremely sensitive, emotional, and entitled. She doesnt work but asks my aunt and grandmother for money and runs up credit card bills. I've been helping with bills since I was 14. I dont live with her anymore and I still pay her phone bill. 
My boyfriend has never liked her because of her behavior. At first I was very enmeshed with her and upset with him for it but i have greatly distanced myself and now see how screwed up she is. I've been living with my boyfriend for about 8 months now. We invited her over for dinner last month and it was going fine besides the entitled looks and comments about how we should get better things for our apartment. Then my mom asked if she could come over every other week and my boyfriend felt uncomfortable by that. She asked him if it made him uncomfortable, he said yes, and then she started crying uncontrollably. I didnt know what to do, so I asked him if he could go into the other room, and my mom said ""yeah, go upstairs"" which was really rude. She kept crying and said she wanted to leave, I said ok, sorry, gave her a hug and kiss and walked her to the door. 
My boyfriend and I had a huge blowout over it and then he went over to apologize to make me happy. She slammed the door on him, then opened it again, then told him that he makes me a terrible person, that he ruined her relationship with me, and that she didnt accept his apology. I talked to her once since then before today and told her that her behavior was inappropriate and she needs to apologize to my boyfriend. She refused and turned it on me, saying I need to apologize to her. I told her no. My boyfriend saw that she texted me today, acting normal, like she didnt say all that rude shit to him last month. I said she was getting him a present for xmas and he said he doesnt want it. 
I asked him if he was going to come to holidays this year and he said probably not. 
I get it. I do. My mom is insane but balancing this is really difficult and I dont know what to do? I just want him to go and act civil but he refuses because he said hes not going to enable her or be a pushover when shes so rude. 
Which again, I get. But I want to see the rest of my family whom are completely normal, but if I go ill get passive aggressive comments from my mom about how my boyfriend isnt a good boyfriend for not coming. 
I dont like my mom, but I dont want to cut her out, atleast not right now. Because if I cut her out I cant attend family parties etc. I realize that anyone I'm with is not going to like my mother and that's OK. I just want suggestions on how to deal with it..

Tldr; my mom is insane and makes it impossible for me to keep her in my life while being in a relationship with a great guy "

"20sF, 30sM. One year relationship, he cheats on me with 3 different women


Reddit, 

Please be honest. Can you really survive infidelity? Is it worth it to put work and effort into fixing this relationship? Or should I walk?

Here are the details:

We date for a year. He hooks up with 3 women during that time. I stumble upon some written proof. I give him a chance to come clean, he lies to my face 4 times. I confront him with the truth. He confirms. Now he wants a second chance, to get couples counseling. Or at least that's what he thinks he wants. I am devastated, heartbroken, and completely in shock. I told him I needed time to process. And I'm here because I want to hear your story. Has anyone else been in my shoes? What was the outcome?

Appreciate all the help.

PS: He gave me an STD (before I found out) and didn't even come clean then. Led me to believe he got it from his ex.

"How/when do I [24F] tell my parents I’m going home with my BF [26M] for Christmas?


This is not supposed to be a big deal but I get so awkward talking to my parents about dating so I’ve just been freaking out bc I know I need to tell them soon lol.

I live at home with my parents, btw.

I have plans to fly to my boyfriend’s home state to spend Christmas and New Years there with his family. 

My parents know I have a boyfriend. My dad has met him once and my mom hasn’t. My dad thought he was nice. My parents never ask me about my dating life and my mom has said she wants to meet him but never brought it up again so I haven’t brought him around. He’s the first guy that has met my parents (dad) and I was super nervous, but it went well. And they know I stay over at his house sometimes (he lives close by with roommates).

Now that it’s November I know I should tell them soon, I just feel awkward. In my ideal world I’d just say on the day “hey I’m leaving for the airport today to go home with BF, see you in a week” but I know I really should not do that, haha.

Is it just bc it’s my first time being this serous with someone and getting families involved that I feel so awkward? Any tips to make it less weird? My parents are pretty chill but my mom may ask a lot of questions.

TL;dr: how can I be less awkward and tell my parents I’m going home with my bf for the holidays?"
"Found out my (18M) ex-boyfriend started cutting and unsure how to handle it // I am (17F)


I broke up with my ex 5 months ago and he didn't handle it very well. Eventually we got to the point where we were amicable, but we didn't talk much at all. I think he was upset with that.

Two days ago I received a text from his female best friend saying that he has been cutting due to depression and other things. She said that everything she was  saying wasn't helping so she thought I  would be able to help him and get through to him. He always had mental health issues. When we were dating,he struggled with anorexia and bulimia. 

I decided to text him and talk with him about his issues. This was after not texting a long while, only little bit here and there. He seemed resistant to getting help but I sent him links about self-harm coping strategies and said whenever you're ready, you can look at them. While we were talking,he seemed upset that we're not good friends i.e. talking alot or hanging out. A part of me worried he hasn't moved on 

I really want to help him get better and support him but I don't want him to become dependent and attached to me again because I don't think that would help him either with his issues. How should I proceed?

TLDR: Ex started cutting and Im afraid he will start depending and getting attached to me again. How should I proceed?

"My (29f) boyfriend (35m) does not empathize with my feelings and I don’t know how to make him understand that I just want emotional support and understanding from him.


We’ve been together for close to 7 years now. We’ve gone through a lot of changes and improvements together and I feel our relationship now is better than before. However, I’ve always noticed a lack of sympathy and empathy when it comes to me talking about what makes me upset or sad. 

Today I had an interview for a job I really want. Last night I was telling bf that my biggest fear would be to walk in to a room with several people interviewing me (I’ve had this done before and it was pretty nerve wrecking). What do you know, today I walk in and have 6 people interviewing me at the same time followed by being brought into another room where I was interviewed by 3 other people at the same time. 

After I left the hr office, I called my bf and stopped by his apartment and told him about it. I even cried because of the intensity of the anxiety I felt and held in for the past hour. I guess it was a kind of relief to cry it out. I know I know. I’m crying after an interview but the reason I cried was because I’ve always suffered from social anxiety and this type of interview caught me off guard. I was mentally and emotionally exhausted after the interview. So while I cried, he just laid in bed and just said “well you just need to practice to get used to this” or “the more you do these things, the more comfortable you’ll get”. I just looked at him and told him I was hoping to get a bit of sympathy since he suffers from anxiety too. And after years of going to school, doing presentations, talking aloud in front of coworkers, nothing has made me feel ‘better’ or ‘comfortable’ about it. And his reply was “well it’s over with now. You just had an interview and you’re crying about it.” 

I feel like he doesn’t get it. He suffers from anxiety worse than mine so I thought he’d be able to empathize with me. I’m not crying cause I got an interview. I cried out of the frustration and intense anxiety I felt throughout the whole time. I know everyone gets nervous for interviews but I guess I stress a bit more than others and I know I should work on that. I left the apartment feeling even more upset. I just feel it’s not fair because I give him a lot of empathy and sympathy and show a lot of care and do a lot for him without him ever asking me. My bf went through a very difficult and challenging time this past summer. And although I do not know what it was like, i was there to listen and try to comfort him the best I could. I would have never told him, “oh just try to get used to it” or “you’ll get over it, it’s no big deal”. I just wish he would do the same for me. I was hoping he’d call me tonight before I go to sleep and he hasn’t and I’m pretty sure he hasn’t because I left his place upset. He tends to just really distance himself when I’m upset and I wish he wouldn’t. 

How can I make him see my point without me trying to sound like I’m complaining? Am I wrong for this? Or is he right about how he went about this and I’m just overreacting? Can anyone ever just suddenly become sympathetic if you ask them to or it’s just their nature? I don’t know how to talk about this with him.

Tl;dr: my bf does not empathize with my feelings and I don’t know how to talk to him to make him see that emotional support is important to me

"How do you deal with a breakup when there's work to be done?


TL;DR I [18M] Got hardcore dumped but academics wait for no man. How can I stop feeling like shit and actually get some very pressing work done?

This question isn't so much about a relationship as it is about a lack of one. To make a long story short: I got dumped over text message by my first  partner in 5 years. She's dating someone else now and has gone lengths to avoid seeing to me in person, let alone talking to me. I feel broken. All the energy I can muster just goes straight in to feeling horrible. 

I can and will get over this. I think I've felt worse before. However, the biggest workload I've ever had in my life has just been dropped on my lap and the deadlines are tight. Plus, I still have classes to go to, further shrinking my time window. I'm a very slow writer even when I have my emotions in check. I keep getting distracted by how awful I feel and the quality of my writing has seriously dropped. Hell, I can't even calm down enough to go to sleep right now.

So, I ask you this. Does anyone have strategies for dealing with emotions when there just isn't any time? Maybe a schedule that balances time grieving with time suppressing?"

 I’ve had lots of wierd issues with relationships in the past (mostly getting too attached too quickly, and trust shit). I met her on Bumble a few weeks ago, and we hit it off right away (similar personalities/intrests/life philosophies). Honestly, she was the girl of my dreams. Found out she had severe depression and anxiety, but it didn’t really phase me. I struggle with depression, and cope by drinking heavily. A few days ago, I decided enough was enough, and to seek help. Same day, I suddenly realized I didn’t have feelings for her anymore. I’m not sure if this is just the progression of the relationship, if its related to my issues, or I just don’t really feel for her any more. But at the same time I think I do have feelings for her. Basically I can’t figure out what the fuck is going on in my head. At the same time, I'm starting to get the feeling that I don't actually want a relationship, I just like the idea of one. I’m worried about her, because she fell for me really fast and hard, and with her issues, I worry about what will happen if I end it. Like I said, I'm going through a bunch of shit right now, so I can't tell if that's what's affecting me. What the fuck do I do?

After a two year relationship we ended things because she[20F] said she didn’t feel romantic anymore.  And now she is having a ton of fun hanging with people all the time.

"Give me [22m] advice about whether I shouldn't or should stay with my girlfriend [21f]


Hi all - this is going to be a LONG read, but I don't have anybody to put this weight on so I need to get it out.

&amp;#x200B;

So my girlfriend is 21, I'm 22 - close to 23. I've been with my girlfriend for nearly 3 years, and at the beginning I was a prick to her, completely. I text ex-girlfriends, she caught girls sending me photos, I never physically cheated but emotionally definitely. It definitely ruined her completely, I understand and acknowledge that. It's not the real me, I don't feel like that person I was 3 years ago, not at all. She made me deleted every girl from snapchat, instagram etc which I accepted, or I knew it'd carry on hurting her. She still follows boys she's said are attractive from our area, I've never said anything because I'm pretty laid back and not caught up in that sort of stuff - plus I knew she didn't ever like boys photos etc so there was no link whatsoever. She's stood by me a lot, and encouraged me a lot throughout the years, I honestly don't know where I'd be without her... she gave me money when I needed it the most, it's a long story but I paid her back 2 months later as promised but without that, I'd never be where I am now. I have a decent sized savings account and a great job as an engineer (again, wouldn't be here without her family, they got me my job), and so does she - if not more. So it's nice to know she's never liked me for just money, whereas some people would only be interested in that.

&amp;#x200B;

But recently, the past 18 months say, we've been bickering about a LOT of stuff... like the correct way to pronounce words, if a story is told incorrectly etc. We travel a lot, we've both got pretty good jobs, so we get a lot of holiday and travel a lot, we've been abroad 6 times in 2018 alone, and they say travel makes or breaks a couple. We spoke about our bickering in February on a holiday and we both said we didn't want to lose each other but wasn't happy, her side was that I didn't show much emotion and she felt like more of a friend of mine than a girlfriend, I acknowledged that and had that vibe myself, but since then we've been great - no arguments whatsoever. I love her family, I genuinely believe they'd do anything to make me happy, they spoil me more than my own parents, I'm very close with her brothers and we went to school together and we get the train to work together every day. My family is a little broken, we're not really a family... and her family tries to bring me in more to experience it all - which can be nice but also sometimes I want my own time. My family also loves her, and think she's a very nice girl overall, my mum has asked me when I'm planning to propose etc. But I don't like that she always says my family is broken, like she always worries if my family and hers would get along properly (not just hello, hi) but properly at Christmas dinners etc, wether my parents would argue with them etc. Like she thinks her family is SO perfect but mine is dysfunctional, but my family is everything to me. I lost my nan in January and we were extremely close, and I feel as if she got fed up of me speaking about it, so I just stopped mentioning it to her and carried that burden, but I feel a partner should try and help you more? She probably didn't mean to, but it's how it came across. I also don't like how when we're travelling, or when she's at mine, she CONSTANTLY calls her parents. I could go to the toilet and come back and she's on the phone to them, she's not independent whatsoever, whereas I am. She believes everything her family says is right, they're pretty wealthy so she thinks following their pathways will work, but it won't anymore and she just thinks they know everything about anything, they can do no wrong in her eyes.

&amp;#x200B;

She's been talking about wanting to get engaged soon, and I'm okay with that, or so I thought. We haven't really been sleeping together, like it's once a fortnight, if that... she's always too tired and every time I bring it up, she snaps at me and says she's not in the mood... to the extent I've stopped asking or trying because she's always too tired etc. We're not really affectionate, we hardly kiss unless it's during sex. Again, which is rarely. At the beginning of our relationship, it'd be constant (I think that's everyone though, right?), like we'd be out and go back immediately to sleep together or in the car etc. We've not done that in 2 years. I find myself looking at ex girlfriends instagram's etc to see how they're getting on, or girls I've spoken to previously, which I shouldn't do at all, I don't think? She speaks about us buying our first house next year, and I think like... how can I be with someone and her talk about kids etc when she's never in the mood to have sex, how can that be possible... I wouldn't say I'm unattractive by any means, nor is she. She just can't be bothered anymore, and I don't see what's changed from my side, I used to enjoy having sex every day/every other day, so did she - now it's completely switched. And trust me, I've tried talking to her about it, she always says she can't help it or she'll try, but it never changes.

&amp;#x200B;

Then last Friday, I saw a boy she knows I don't like (and I've mentioned it before) message her on snapchat, like typing... so I showed her and she said he was asking where her friend was because they were out together. I just said okay, fair enough... then he messaged her again when I was with her, so I showed her as I had her phone in my hand and she just said why the hell's he messaging me? As if she had no clue but didn't open it. I just left it at that and we went our own ways... the whole drive home she was being overly nice, asking me stupid questions about my day and agreeing with everything, but when I got home it was bugging me so I mentioned it and she said they'd been speaking just friendly and it was nothing more. My original grind was that she lied, she acted as if she had no understanding of why he had messaged her, when she clearly did... she says she doesn't remember saying that whatsoever but it was friendly, she promises and it's nothing more. I believe her completely, she'd never cheat on me but again, my grind is the fact she tried lying to hide it when she knew it'd bug me. Then when I brought it up, she flipped it on me and said how can I not trust her after what I did, which was 3 years ago now... she's saying thanks for trusting me etc, but surely her bringing up the past proves she still doesn't trust me? I think she knew exactly what she was doing, ie how I'd react or she would've mentioned he had asked her how she's doing etc.

&amp;#x200B;

We've not spoken in 2 days, and I don't really miss talking to her or seeing her, I've been busy at work so maybe that's why. But I'm not sure what to do, do I throw it away and try to move on? Or do I attempt to reconcile? I'm not really interested in looking for new girls etc, I kind of feel I need the head room right now but one part of me wants to text her but then another half says I shouldn't because I'm not in the wrong, and another part of that half says maybe this isn't best for me anymore. We don't really go on dates anymore etc either, I feel as if she's a friend to me more than a girlfriend, but I also don't want to lose her because it could just be anger talking. I'm pretty drained from work all the time, and she works on a computer so she's always full of energy on my off days and wants to do stuff and go out, but I'm never really in the mood because I work shifts so sometimes my weekends are my only days off, and she doesn't get that and always wants to go out. I know I should go out more, but I'm just too exhausted in this busy period.

&amp;#x200B;

What is your advice for me? Someone please guide me.

I don't really have many friends anymore, I have 1/2 friends and I don't want to burden them with this in case we get back together, it'll make me look stupid, so I'm asking the advice of you guys and girls who will know more.

&amp;#x200B;

Feel free to judge me for my past mistakes, nobody else knows about them but you guys. I'm too ashamed to tell my friends, because that's not me anymore. And feel free to ask away, if you have questions.

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR me and my girlfriend have been fine for a while after a rocky start, but now we've argued and not spoken in 2 days and now I'm not sure whether I want to be with her as I've not missed her company, what do I do?"

I left my kid's father 2 years ago. It was a real painful break-up with the last two years of the 7 year relationship being extremely unhealthy and toxic. My kid's father and I still can not be in the same room for any extended period of time due to how bitter he is of me leaving the relationship, even though It was the best thing for us and our kids. The past two years he has been homeless on a beach and has not contributed to helping raise his kids.

"I [f22] hooked up with someone on campus [m21] for a week, it didn’t work out. Now it’s awkward on campus and with our mutual friends. How can I make it not awkward? Can we be friends?


In September I met this guy on tinder. Turned out he was friends with one of my friend groups (not one I’m very close with). We went out one night together, got super drunk and lost each other downtown. The next day (Sunday)he helps me get my things from storage, we hang out all night until 5am. We don’t hook up cause I’m on my period, but it was really intense. As he left he said he wanted to do it again. 

There’s some back and forth and we finally hook up that Wednesday. I really enjoyed myself but he didn’t cum. He said he had masterbated to make sure he didn’t cum too fast, so I didn’t really give it any thought. We cuddle and he asked me what I liked in bed. After giving him a short answer, he starts telling me the story of when he and his ex gf first had sex. Super red flag but I brush it off. 

I had just gotten out of a toxic relationship a few months before and had been in long distance things for three years (long story) so I came on too strong. Texted him things I shouldn’t have. Told my friends about him and asked around about him. I misinterpreted us hanging out and talking until 5am and then cuddling and stuff to mean he was into me, in reality I think he was trying to be respectful of my boundaries but was clearly just looking for a hookup.

I complain to the friend group about him talking about his ex in bed. We all go to a party together (Friday)  and I feel super weird about that. His cousin warns me he isn’t over his ex. I see him hold hands with someone at the party and I leave. Friend convinces me to go out with them anyway. I don’t really talk to him the whole night because I feel weird and am embarrassed about leaving. I don’t think he noticed but the mutual friend probably told him later. 

Later in the night I’m drunk and try to drink call and text him to see what he’s up to (booty call). He doesn’t respond/ it was 2/3am. I hang out with another friend at the bar instead. 

Anyway, a few days later he comes by to pick up something (I think? I forgot the reason). He says he’s going to the library, I volunteer to go with him (we had gone to the library together the first night so I thought it was okay). We step out of my apt and he cuts right to the chase, saying he just wants to be friends.  I said I figured cause he didn’t seem over his ex. I go to the library. He goes somewhere else. We literally never speak again. 

Thing is, I go to a small liberal arts school and i see him around all the time. I feel like I came on too strong and am embarrassed with that group of friends and feel like I can’t hang out with them anymore (I wanted to be closer to them). Yeh, I still think he’s cute, but honestly I just want to be friends with him. But, actually friends. Or at least not feel so awkward. We both avoid each other. 

I’m sure he’s seeing other people and I’ve started seeing someone I really like. I was upset about the whole thing for awhile but I’m not anymore. 

How can I deal with this? Can I? Or am i doomed to awkwardness forever? I get that maybe we can’t be best friends but awkwardness sucks. I don’t even want closure. It literally lasted a week. I’ve learned what I needed to learn from the experience. 

TDLR I came on too strong to a guy on campus. He said he wanted to be friends but we haven’t spoken since. It’s awkward to see him around campus cause we avoid each other. I feel like I can’t be friends with out mutual friends. I want to know how to address the situation, if possible. "
"Boyfriend (24m) shared something very personal of mine with his friends. Feel deceived


So some background. this all started when bf “microcheated”. Basically he was sexting this girl that I thought he was just friends with and when I got suspicious he assured me nothing was wrong. Well I found out that wasn’t the case, and shit hit the fan. I considered it cheating despite nothing actually physical having happened. It was more about the deception and the fact he lied and hid it throughout our relationship. There is also a dark history with this girl that made everything so much worse.

I was going to dump him initially but we talked and he showed a lot of remorse and deleted his social media accounts and asked for another chance so I gave him one as we live together and have a dog together. Since this happened he has worked really hard. He lets me have access to his phone whenever though I never go in it or ask for it, he just isn’t secretive with it at all gave me the password leaves it out etc. Whenever I’m feeling insecure or anxious he will sit and talk with me until I’m feeling secure again, just been sweet and working hard to make things right again. And for the most part it has been 

But sometimes I get really upset and hurt about it, I feel anxious that he lied to be so easily and for so long. It’s been a couple months since I found their sexts and nudes and stuff so the healing process is still kinda fresh I guess, anyway I was feeling really angry about it again but I didn’t want to go off or run in circles again so I told him I was going to write everything I was feeling in a letter, and he thought it was a great idea.

So I did. And the letter got really personal. I talked about my physically abusive ex (which he knew about but it’s relevant for context here), the insecurities I’ve felt since, etc. He read the letter and said he was going to formulate one back, I said okay. 

I’m not gonna repeat the convo verbatim but this morning, boyfriend let it slip that he photos of my letter to his brother and his girlfriend. He says he did t because he has a horrible anxiety attack reading it and needed advice and help understanding the letter, which I get and I’m fine with asking for help but sending them photos of it?! I shared really personal stuff in that letter and I’m beyond humiliated they all read and analyzed it together. I read the letter again and the embarrassment I felt knowing they read it too.... it was a little much. 

Boyfriend has been msging me non stop but I can’t even look at the messages, I’m so upset and humiliated, I wrote that for him not for them and it was extremely personal and I feel exposed. I feel like I’m gonna feel so embarrassed around them now because they’ve read such a raw vulnerable part of me.

Am I over reacting here? He’s been incredibly apologetic but I’m so unbelievably angry and upset. What do I even do here. 

Tl;dr boyfriend let friends read a very personal vulnerable letter I wrote just for him and I’m very angry, hurt, and embarrassed. "

"He [20 M] is giving me [18 F] extremely bad vibes.


Hello everyone!

I met this guy in my freshman year of high school. We used to talk in high school, but it was never serious. We ended up going to the same college and now things are starting to get serious. We can connect on a personal level and we never get bored with each other. I can talk to him about almost anything and I always go to him to make me feel better. There were times when I had nobody and he was the only one there. I feel like we make eachother happy. But there are a few things about him that are putting me off. For starters, he seems very sexist. He's always talking about stuff that guys can do that girls cant. I always tried to talk to him about equality and teach him that guys and girls should be respected equally, but it always seems to go in one ear and out the other. For example, we talked about a story about a woman cheating on her husband, and automatically he starts going off saying all these derogatory things, but when I mentioned guys cheating, he said something along the lines of ""well guys are allowed to cheat"" and stuff. That really put me off. That's only one example. There were also times when we got sexual that he was really degrading. Last week, after we finished, he slapped me. It did not hurt but it was still a slap. It bothered me but I did not say anything (I know stupid). Then, today while we were being active, he called me a bitch. This is when I put my foot down (I know I should have said something earlier) and I demanded that he drive me back home. He was trying to make amends but I was not hearing it. I really have no idea what to do at this point. My gut is telling me to drop him, but my heart is trying to tell me to work things out with him. Any advice would be helpful.

tl;dr I've known this guy for a long time and I'm getting feelings for him. We are starting to get serious, but I am getting a bad feeling about him."
"I (34f) caught my husband (35m) performing oral sex on himself, is this a normal thing?


&amp;#x200B;

We have been married for 15 years and I walked in our bedroom and he was performing oral sex on himself. We are very religious and oral sex is considered sodomy and homosexuality is not OK. This happened Saturday and I haven't let him back in the house since. I talked with my pastor and he said that it's sin and he should enter consoling but my husband won't do it and said I shouldn't have told anyone about what he was doing. Should I forgive him or force him to go to consoling for his sodomy and homosexuality.  


tl;dr: I caught my husband performing oral sex on himself and it's against my religion.

P.S. I am not homophobic, it's just against my religion. Please understand."
"I [22F] have a HUGE crush on an engaged guy [24M]...

"I [25 M] am not attracted to my gf [24 F] of 3 months


I know 3 months is not a long time but its about that time where Im evaluating whether I want to continue to see my gf long term or end it before we get too invested.

My gf seems to either be attractive or ugly depending on the situation.  Its really weird. Maybe its the makeup, maybe its the ""perfect angle"" pictures, but sometimes I'll think she's really pretty and other times I question whether Im attracted to her. I know people have bad photos, but Im not sure how I go from ""wow, shes so pretty. how did I get her?"" to ""she looks really bad. her face is really round and she looks like shes 10 years older than her actual age."" Im absolutely stumped. I think I have this ideal version of her in my head from all of the ""perfect photos"" she has on instagram/snap but reality is different when you cant take 20 pics and choose the best one. When Im with her, I dont look at her with such scrutiny, but when I look at some candid photos or quick selfies of us together, Im not attracted to her. Any advice here? I guess Im not use to being with a girl who is so good at taking attractive photos but looks different in real life. Its like when some girls take off their makeup and they look completely different, except in this case, the makeup is all of the ""perfect"" instagram/snap photos she sends me. Maybe Im being too critical of her ""bad"" photos because Im able to analyze every imperfection.

tldr; GF looks good in her insta/snap photos. I dont notice so much how she looks when we're together. When we take candid photos or quick selfies, I think she looks different/slightly unattractive. Dont know if I should continue to date her."
"My (28M) Fiancée(29F) makes me want to postpone our engagement.


We’ve been dating two years, and she is now pregnant with our child that we’ve tried to conceive for almost a year until it finally happened. 

I’ll add that I was close to breaking things off with her just before we found out she was pregnant, but the excitement of it finally happening and a new job that took us to a new city really started to show change in our relationship. I was on the verge of breaking up because it felt like she was living a double life. One with the father of her daughter (6) and one with me. Actually maybe triple life, because there’s the one where she wants to be single and go out all the time because “she didn’t get that opportunity having a child while she was young”. We live together and originally the arrangement was her daughter split time between our house and her dads house. She constantly told me how she hated him and wanted nothing to do with him but has to deal with him because of their daughter, yet I would find her texting him in the middle of the night or found she went to the movies as a family with them and lied about it to me telling me she was somewhere else. Oh and just before we move I find a text where he’s saying that she told him her and I broke up. There’s been countless other lies and disrespect to me as the man she chose to be with and said she loved and wanted children and marriage with, and I always forgave her and thought maybe I needed to do more to show her my commitment. I knew it wasn’t me, but I was in love with her when I thought everything was good. 

So fast forward and a month after we find out she’s pregnant, I was offered a new job across the country and she was completely down for her and her daughter making the move with me. That definitely was a huge commitment to make especially given her daughter moving away from her dad, so it made me feel much better about the things that have happened. She explained how she was being so stupid and I never deserved to be treated that way and she was sorry and she’d never make me doubt her again. I’m the guy she wants to marry and have a future with. 

So in the transition to a new location, new pregnancy, new relationship dynamic, things were going really really well. So I eventually propose to her (and her daughter) and things couldn’t be better. 

Lately, she’s been having bouts of depression (from pregnancy and moving) and I guess she felt really tired of “being a mom” and never having a break, as well as other things going on with her family, and she took it out on me. To which I explained that if she needs a break just let me know and me and her daughter will go do something and let her have a mommy day, as well as explained to her that there’s a lot on my plate as well but we’re parents and adults so it’s hard but we have to keep pushing. In this argument, I notice her ring isn’t on, so I lost it at that point because I felt like taking it off was so wrong and I asked her a long time ago if I’d have to worry about her doing that. I asked because she had a habit of blocking me and/or posting things on social media when we got into arguments and basically making it seem as if she was single. So her taking the ring off just really made me feel like I made a huge mistake so I told her to give me the ring since she wasn’t wearing it. We talked it out she apologized and a week or so later I gave her the ring back. 

Next, we didn’t even argue, but she removes my name from Facebook as “engaged to”. Her reasoning was because mine didn’t show at the top of the screen, to which I was unaware and told her it was a quick fix but before even coming to me with how she felt, she removed my name. To me, this is minuscule but the principle and the message it sends is concerning. 

So at this point, I don’t think she’s ready, or mature enough, for marriage. I don’t want to end things because I know all that she’s going through mentally and how it’s affecting others, requires professional help. She’s obliged to take that step, so now it’s just living and dealing with the down times where certain things can and will happen to affect our relationship. But I don’t want to feel like she’s going to continue to make me question the relationship, and I don’t want to hope that things get better only for them to never get better. Calling off the engagement, for now, I feel would send her further into a depressive state and even cause her to react against me real bad this time. So I don’t know what to do. 

TL;DR

Fiancée removes ring and changes relationship status, now I feel like I made a mistake.
