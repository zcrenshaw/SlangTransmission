"This is 100% not an r/imsocool. I hate horror movies because they’re boring, predictable, and never “scary”. Maybe it’s because I don’t believe in spirits, the paranormal, or any kind of mythical monsters/creatures. Yes death can be scary, but every murderer is a person, and people aren’t scary. AMA

"I'm a 36 year old properly diagnosed schizoid, AMA


I will try to make it interesting in hopes that it might help someone, someday as I would've liked something to help me understand.

I saw several other AMAs made about that topic which uh, seemed to go poorly. I still think it could be interesting for some people and it might be interesting for me to answer questions to maybe get better insight in what impression I leave with other people. I also hope that it somehow will help me along my way.

Although mental illness is mental illness, people are affected differently, so I will not quote some psychiatric diagnosis book. If you really want to, I guess you could look up the Wikipedia article. Schizoid personality disorder is not the same as schizophrenia. I did have sort of a psychotic break brought upon by stress as a teenager which is probably connected to my disorder, but I do not hear voices or have hallucinations, nor has that event ever repeated itself to my knowledge. Schizoid personality disorder is a rare diagnosis, (and yes, this diagnosis was made by two actually licensed therapists, I am not self-diagnosed or anything like that) mostly because people affected by this disorder do not seek professional help as they don't feel anything wrong with them and my guess is also, that they simply often slip through the cracks. The disorder basically means that people have a lack of interest in social relationships, and prefer to be solitary. Schizoid people cannot properly express their emotions, positive or negative, and just might lack them. Sexual interest is often non-existant. Basically humans are social animals and this component is lacking in schizoids.

This disorder basically means in my case that I have absolutely no interest in forming lasting relationships and also really can't love. I never had a girlfriend or had sex, nor do I have desire to. I can appreciate the female form, but I do not wish to touch a woman, or really anybody. I do not feel bad about this, although I often feel emptiness, especially since it is very hard for me to feel in general. I sort of feel like a guest in a strange world and find it very hard to relate to the emotions other people feel. I can watch romantic movies and judge them on their merits, but they do not resonate with me in the same ways I can see them resonating with others. I do not really feel anything for other people, even people I have known for a long time. I have seen people in my life die, and I have buried my own parents. I liked my parents but the days they died, and the days of their respective funerals, I don't think I was sad, although I do miss them.

I am not a psychopath, and this is no superpower. It's actually quite deliberating and my life is very negatively impacted by it. I also feel often like I am missing out on a lot. Although there are some components, I am not a psychopath and I do feel empathy with other people and don't want anyone to get hurt or would ever want to hurt anyone. Sadly I have done so quite often inadvertently .

I did have attempts at relationships, which invariably failed because I could not deliver what was expected of me. If there's any curiosity, I can go into detail here.

There are evenings where I am just overwhelmed with a feeling of depersonalization and emptiness, like absolutely nothing (including my body) seems real. I sometimes spend such evenings and nights almost obsessively watching videos on subreddits like /r/watchpeopledie (NSFW, obviously) just in an attempt to feel anything, even if it's just disgust. In my younger years, I searched out other extremes. They didn't give me that thing, that spark, I see in other people either. Sometimes something does cause a feeling in me, and I end up obsessing over it for a while as a result, until it fades. These can be the weirdest things.

I really like all forms of art, but am very picky in what I can like. If I actually end up liking something, I obsess over that too for a while. You can see, there's a pattern here, everything that manages to cause any kind of emotion is utterly fascinating to me and I latch onto it.

When I was young, I did not know how to behave amongst people and mental illness sadly was a taboo so I did not get the help I needed. To compensate, I learned with the years to do these things me and my therapist dubbed ""mini-roles"", like I am acting some character in certain social situations. For me it is like a game and it sadly leads me to make up stories and lie which I don't like to do or fell pulled in because I kinda enjoy the acting and start making up characters which also has gotten me into awkward situations sometimes because I've gotten quite apt at it and I can be very convincing. I'm not proud of it, but I've done things like impersonating doctors. It makes it easy for me to interact with others, to just imagine it like a movie where everyone has his role. I always feel like I learn so much from it.

It's not quite clear but schizoid personality disorder is probably genetic, combined with upbringing. 

Well, I hope any of that was interesting to read at least, if you have questions, feel free to ask."
