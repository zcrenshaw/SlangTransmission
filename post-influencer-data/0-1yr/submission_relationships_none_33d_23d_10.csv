"My [16F] mom [53F] is making a huge deal out of me deciding to be an organ donor.


I recently passed my drivers test and got my license. When my mom and I went to the DMV to get it, I admit that I did check off the box for organ donation without telling her. Maybe this was the wrong move, but I rationalized it as making a personal decision for myself and my future that she may or may not be apart of — for other reasons unrelated to this. My brother supports my choice. 

Yesterday I received my license card in the mail, and was super pumped. Getting my license was a long and hard process for me and I was excited and really proud to have it in my hands. I went to show my mom and she was really happy too. And then she looked down and saw the Donor designation and flipped out. She immediately started interrogating me about it, and it really made me feel confused and bad.

She said that organ donation was against “our”’religion (she is a Muslim. I am not, at all) and started saying dumb shit like “Doctors will work less hard to save you because you’re a donor.” Just superstitious BS that really just confounded me. I didn’t want to be morbid by any means, but I did ask her what I was going to do with my organs after I pass away. At that point she threw it back at me and said I had better get it “fixed.”

This entire incident just left a bad taste in my mouth. For one, even though I’m still a minor I don’t think she should be taking advantage of that to control me to this extent. She has a controlling nature in pretty much all aspects of my life, whether it’s forcing me to pray or visit family members I’m not fond of or other things. Secondly, I don’t even think there’s anything in the Koran that says you can’t donate organs? (If there is, I’d appreciate a source, please.)

And lastly, being a donor is important to me as a person. One of my best friends had to get a liver transplant when she was very young, and she did, courtesy of another child who died in a car accident and whose parents decided to donate their organs. If she hadn’t gotten that transplant, she wouldn’t be here today. To me, this is an unselfish choice that could save lives and save families from the pain of losing a person just because there were no donors. Obviously, I don’t want to die suddenly, but if I do, I’d rather make that loss of life mean something more than just the end of me.

**TL;DR** My mom is against me being an organ donor and she’s acting cold and demanding I change it even though I don’t want to. What should I do?"
"Google data is ruining my trust in my marriage.


 

My \[27f\] husband \[27m\] have a very open and honest relationship, even too honest in my opinion. We do everything together, and basically live in each others' pocket. We're best friends. We tell each other anything and everything, and my husband even tells me things I don't necessarily want to hear, but he is just so pro-honesty he tells me anyway.

I downloaded our Google data because I thought it was pretty crazy all the stuff it had recorded on us both, and I wanted us to sit and look at it all. One of the first things I did was look at our maps just to see how much driving around we do on the weekends, but almost immediately I noticed that it was pinging him at an apartment across town on one of the weekends that he worked. It showed him going there at like 4am before heading to work at 6. On another day, it showed him going there after work for an hour then coming home. There were even more during the week, showing him going before work and showing him going there on days where he'd told me he was going out for dinner with his bosses (no indication of him stopping anywhere else like a restaurant or bar). The most significant one was when he took a trip a few months ago. He left a day early and came home a day late, which wasn't a surprise because he was so excited about this trip. However, the map shows him leaving our house, going to this apartment, spending the night there, setting off on his trip the next day, spending a week on the trip, coming back into town, spending the night at this apartment, then finally coming home on the day I was expecting him. When he came home he'd brought me a treat from a specific store and said he'd just got it on his way home, and the map even shows him stopping at this store, but that was before going to the apartment and spending the night there, the day before he actually came home.

He is adamant that it's wrong, that he hangs out at the house for a couple of hours before heading to work, and that he left/came back to town the days he says he did. He said he'll do anything it takes to prove it's wrong if there's a way, and will even do couples counseling. He's said he will be 100% transparent with me, sending me pictures throughout his day to prove where he is, letting me check when he clocks in and out at work, checking his phone, whatever I want if that's what I need.

I'm so conflicted, because we are so close, so honest, and he adores me, but I just don't know how this data can be so wrong. I'm obsessing over it and I feel like it's ruining my life, and I am so insanely depressed because I don't know what's real and what isn't anymore.  


  
TL;DR: My husband's map data is showing him stopping at an apartment across town. He's always been very honest, even at the expense of my feelings, but is adamant that this data is wrong and he's never been to this place. I feel like I'm going crazy and don't know what to believe."
"I (22F) no longer want to host my friends and don't know how I should break it to them


So I've been living alone in Barcelona in a home my family inherited before I was born. It's centrally located and pretty large (4 bedrooms, but only one functional bathroom). I came here from the US, beginning with a study abroad program but decided I loved it so much that I moved here permanently. 

The friends I've made here have mainly been through my study abroad program and became like family, but moved back to their home countries within the past 6 months or so. I love that they are mostly within Europe and quick flights away, wanting to always visit frequently. 

The problem is I've now basically become my friend group's airbnb. Nobody even considers a hotel now because they know I have so much room in my home, a very flexible schedule, and was excited to host at first. They schedule their trips around my house being available, and I understand hotels are quite expensive here/we are all either college students or fresh out of college and lacking the funds, but I'm starting to get a little tired of it. I'm also asked to host when they're in between apartments, or I'm asked if a friend of a friend needs a place to stay for a few days, etc. 

I think they believe they're not putting me out much because I have the space, however I'm a very private person and do find it draining when people are living with me, it obviously affects my schedule and home routine. I have to wash sheets and prepare bedrooms, deep clean my apartment etc before anyone arrives. 

The thing is, I feel bad saying no when an entire trip is dependent on me being able to host, as it's too expensive otherwise. Some of these friends I feel extremely close to, however this has gotten to the point where I am hosting in total at least 2 weeks out of every month. 

How should I break this to them?

tl;dr I have a large inherited home in Barcelona and have the extra space to host good friends when they're in town, at first was happy to, however they all take advantage of this frequently and now I find myself tired of hosting at least 2 weeks of every month. I want to stop but feel bad and not sure how to explain it to them."
"My (19F) Mum (54F) actively discourage my writing and tells me I should be focused on encouraging my sister (15F) to write instead.


I have been writing novels ever since I received a cheap laptop for Christmas when I was 11. I love writing and everyone who reads my stories enjoys them. So far I have written one particular story, around 5 times (90,000 words each time). Every time I finished I would end up starting from the beginning as my writing would improve so much, I would be cringing as I began proof reading from the start. Aside from that story, I’ve been writing about 3 other novels on the side and entered three writing competitions and won first place with two of them. 

The latest writing competition (I was 18 when I won) I was congratulated personally by the head judge who encouraged me to start publishing my stories. I remember him telling me I had something special and I could definitely make a career out of this. I cried when I got home as I’d never received this kind of encouragement from my family...

My sister, on the other hand, has never written a book. When she was around 7, she would hand write stories in a note book which my parents would enjoy reading. They showed one of the stories to her teacher and her teacher found it cute. As she grew up, she lost interest in writing and hasn’t written anything since. Yet my parents are still so focused on the stories she wrote when she was little, and are convinced she will become the next best selling author.

Recently I started publishing my work on amazon. I’ve only published one book so far but it’s doing really really well. I’ve just finished the second and it’s due to go live today. At the moment I am studying at university and it looks like I’ll soon be able to quit my part time job as writing will earn me more. I told my parents how well it’s doing but they seem very disinterested. They told me that I should be giving advice to my sister and encouraging her to write. 

Last time I visited my parents house, my dad asked me how my book is doing, I had just begun to explain about how many people had read it before my mum cut me off and asked my sister if she was writing anything.

My sister texted me this morning showing me some screenshots from my mum. It went something like this:

Mum: why aren’t you publishing your stories online

Sister: I don’t write stories

Mum: you should! If your sister is making some money then you certainly can. 


Seeing that message really hurt my feelings. After all these years my mum is still convinced that my sister is a better writer than myself. My sister hasn’t written anything since she was 8 but my parents are still convinced she’ll be an author as her English teacher once commented that her creative writing is very good. 

I hate this so much. I wish they would just be proud of me for what I’m doing. Instead they’re telling me to encourage my sister to write, despite her having no interest in becoming an author. 

TLDR: Despite me being a published author and winning writing competitions, my parents do not care and are convinced that my disinterested sister is a better writer than me."
"After almost 2 years of dating, I [28F] told my boyfriend [28M] that I loved him and... it didn’t go well.


My boyfriend and I have never been super forthcoming when it comes to talking about our emotions or affections for one another. He says that he has a hard time communicating how he feels, and that it’s awkward for him to talk about his emotions. I’ve always understood this, and he’s shown his affection for me through his actions rather than his words. I have never questioned his affections for me before. Last night, we had a very intimate moment, and for the first time in our relationship, I said the big words... I love you. He was caught off guard, and took a little time to respond. When he did, he told me that he “wasn’t comfortable saying it back”, and that he didn’t know how he felt. He told me that he “really really liked me, and cared about me more than he has anyone before.” But that he didn’t know if he loved me. He went into a little more depth about his feelings, and how hard it was for him to understand them and communicate them to me, but honestly I was barely listening. I was just too hurt to take it all in. Two years of being together, meeting each others friends and families, spending countless nights together, all the fucking... all that time together. And all I got was an “I really really like you.” He told me that his feelings may develop into love down the road, and that he likes what we have together. He wants to continue with the way that things are now, but something has shifted in me. I don’t know what to do. Do I stay with this man in hopes he may one day reciprocate my feelings, and put my heart and well being on the line like that? It’s an emotional risk I’m scared to take. I’m just hurt and needed to vent I guess. I’d love to hear some opinions, and if anyone has been in a similar situation to mine, please feel free to share how it worked out for you. Thanks all, and I hope everyone is having a much lovelier day than I am! 


TL;DR I told my boyfriend that I loved him for the first time, and he couldn’t say it in return."
"My [50M] wife [52F] is mad about our son’s [24M] tattoos


My wife and I have three kids: J [28M] R [24M] and D[22F]. 

Our son, R, has always been a good kid. He never went to parties or was a brat. Gratuated university with very high marks. Was university student president etc. He has by far been the most easy one of our 3 children, who we love equally may I add.


R and I have always been very close. 10 years ago my wife got diagnosed with cancer. Our oldest son was away at university and my youngest daughter was a bit too young to fully understand what was going on. R was great during this period, he would take care of his sister when I was in the hospital with their mother, would frequently visit, help in the household (we never asked this from him). My wife has always been very grateful to him for the help he provided. 

All this just to give you an image about our son, and how he never caused any ‘trouble’. On to the issue: 6 months ago a picture was posted on Facebook. It had my son tagged, it was from his rugby team. It showed them after training, and our son was topless. No problem, however one could notice that our son had 2 tattoos (we had never noticed this): a pink donut and Spongebob Squarepants.

Yes, Spongebob. 


Now, I must be honest: I was not a fan of them but I had a good laugh. It’s his body, he payed it himself, he doesn’t live at home anymore. I didnt think about it more than that. When asked he told us he got the donut 2 years ago in honor of The Simpsons and his love for donuts. He got Spongebob 7 months ago because he moved SpongeBob (he really does.) and it was after the break-up with his longtime girlfriend.

My wife has been going crazy about it. She saw it and called him. Saying ‘tattoos are bad’ and how it’s ‘tasteless’ and out of character for him. She told him she was ashamed of him and that he really made her feel embarrassed.

I thought it would blow over. I really did. But it hasn’t. Each time he came over (once a week) she would start an argument about it. She would tell everyone about it (family, friends) and where the initial reaction is confusion (Spongebob Squarepants is not the most common tattoo one could have), they get over it.


The wife hasn’t. She is refusing to speak to our son since a month because she wants him to laser it away. Our son replied that if she wouldn’t cut it of, he would get a tattoo of Patrick as well. Ever since it’s the Cold War at home. She refused to talk to him.


Yesterday was his birthday. I called him, wished him happy birthday etc. We had a dinner planned for him but wife wouldn’t come along. Son was really hurt.

I am starting to contemplate divorce. How do I handle this situation?


Tl;dr: wife does not agree with my son’s tattoos, how to handle?"
"my friend (20f) is having an affair with a (46m) man and they want me to work with them but I (24f) feel uncomfortable


I’m sorry if this is a bit all over the place but here goes;

My friend Is having an affair with a man who’s married and has three kids aged from 10 up to 20, he lives with his long term partner of 21 years but it’s unclear whether they’re really together or not, he always dodges the question or answers really vaguely 

In public his long term gf kisses him and hugs him and basically acts just like any other couple and he doesn’t act all lovey dovey with my friend when she’s around so I’m not too sure 

Anyway the messy part is, me and my friend are both artists and Affair guy just opened up a gallery of sorts where he wants to hold certain types of events for different artists and stuff related to that, even though he has no clue about art or artists or any of that stuff.. 

Friend started working with him (eventually leading to sex) because he wanted her input on what to do with the place, they’ve been inseparable ever since and she’s doing a LOOOTTT of work for him (for FREE) basically being his own personal assistant without pay (he gives her free coffee sometimes lol)

She plans all the meetings, contacts people on his behalf, comes up with all the ideas for the gallery and some of them have been really successful, anyway the thing is

I was abroad while all this was going down(when she met him and stuff) and I’ve been back for about a month and she told me she really wants me to be a part of this project, mainly to give them ideas about upcoming events, basically be HER assistant.. now I don’t mind doing this because it’s actually something I love (art stuff) buuuuutttt

The whole thing seems abit fishy, first of all, he kinda rubs me the wrong way sometimes, I feel like he’s this older man trying to be ‘hip’ and trying to re live his younger days or something and I feel like my friend is being naive about the whole relationship thing between them 

Like, what if once the place becomes successful he just drops her like a bad habit and uses all the ideas and hard work we both put into it as his own? And why is he still living with his LT girlfriend? When he claims he ‘loves’ my friend and honestly acts a bit obsessed with her..

I tried talking to her about this but she says I’m being paranoid and maybe I am but I feel like he’s kinda trying to take advantage of us because we’re young and she’s in love with him 

I want an outsider perspective on this hence why I’m posting here, any advice would be appreciated!

Tl;dr- friend is having sex with older man who’s her boss kinda and who recently opened a gallery and wants me to work with her- I’m cautious that this is manipulative"
"I'm taking my (31F) sister (19f) on a city trip to Amsterdam in 6 days and she's ghosting me


When my sister turned 19, my gift for her was a city trip to Amsterdam. Since I'm living a few hours from there, I thought that we could spend 4 days in my city and 2 days in Amsterdam. 

She is currently living in France, at about 5 hours from my place. 

She was really excited about it because she always wanted to go. A few months ago, I asked her when she would feel like going so that I could notify my boss and take some holiday leave. She is a student and has all her summer free. 

I told her I could do the end of August and she told me she wanted to take a week with her friends from x to x but that nothing was planned yet. It was already hard to choose a date with her because of her, and it can incredibly difficult to book something nice in Amsterdam. The accommodations are also really expensive, especially if you wait too much. Anyway, I booked something the week after she was supposed to be with her friends and checked with her before booking the place. She agreed about it. 

Fast forward. We are supposed to leave in 6 days now. I asked her multiple times if she had her ticket booked to come to my place and she didn't. I even offered to book the tickets for her. She's basically having a hard time to organise her trip with her friends that was planned to happen right now. 

I told her as long that she is here for Amsterdam I don't mind about the rest. 

It's been two days that I'm asking her if she had any updates and now she is just ghosting me. I'm really fed up by her attitude. I was really happy to do that with her but the situation right now is kind of ruining it. Since I don't know when ( or if, at this point, ) she will arrive and how long she stays, it's hard for me to plan the rest of my holiday. I took two weeks off and would like to organise myself. 

What would you do?  Should I give her an ultimatum? Should I cancel the whole thing because her attitude sucks? 

I invested a good sum of money on this trip and even if I make a decent amount of money, it's still significant. 

TLDR: I'm taking my sister (19f) on a weekend trip to Amsterdam in 6 days and she's ghosting me because she also has plans with her friends just before. Should I give her an ultimatum?"
"I [29m] feel like I should break up with my girlfriend [28f] because of lack of sexual chemistry. How can I prevent shredding her self-esteem?


Tldr: I need to tell my girlfriend that the sexual chemistry between us does not work. How do I tell her without completely destroying her self-esteem? Need advice!

So my girlfriend and I have been together for about two years. We have a great emotional and mental bond and get along wonderfully. I realized that for me, the sexual chemistry was really low from the beginning. I thought we could work on that and that it would come with time. Unfortunately it did not and it breaks my heart... We have sex somewhat regularly but usually I'd rather just cuddle and watch a movie or do something else with her. Even things I loved doing with previous partner rather turns me off with her. I can't even go down on her because the taste is irritating and that was something I loved to do.

As hard as it is, I feel like she deserves someone who's as much into her as she is into me. I don't want to end up in a long term relationship where both of us are unsatisfied with our sex life, even if all other domains are well. I feel like I can't give her what she wants and needs. 

The thought of breaking up will probably already hurt her very much. She's planning a future with me and talks constantly about moving in together, starting a family etc. I'm afraid that telling her that the sexual chemistry does not work for me will shred her self-esteem and I really want to prevent this. I think my girlfriend is wonderful and beautiful but it somehow doesn't work for me sexually. I had flings with girls which were way below here judging by the looks with which the chemistry was not an issue. So how can I explain this to my girlfriend without completely devastating her? I really hope for some advice!"
"(23F) Completely Humiliated Self in front of Boyfriends (25M) Family


This is my first post but I’m up at night and I can’t sleep because this is haunting me. So my boyfriend (25M) of 7 months and I (23F) went over to his parents house for dinner. I was pretty nervous because we haven’t been dating long and I still don’t know his parents too well and I’m trying to make a good impression on them but my awkwardness can kind of get in the way. I just started my period that morning and I’m wearing a tampon. We get about to the end of dinner when I feel some moisture down there. I don’t immediately freak out because it’s not uncommon to feel that in jeans and for it to be nothing. So I get up and head to the bathroom when I notice I’ve just bled through my white and black checkered pants in front of his whole family. I panic in the bathroom and tie my jacket around my waist. It’s a jean jacket so the sleeves are stiff and poor and covering the blood mark. I realize now this should have been my que to let my boyfriend know we have to go but I’ve convinced myself at this point that maybe no ones noticed and that it can’t get any worse. So I’m there for another hour or so with his family just chatting but I can just feel myself getting damper and damper I make sure to stay unseen behind furniture. We finally head off and I ask my boyfriend if we can stop at my place so I can grab some stuff. It’s not until I get a load of myself I’m the mirror that I realize the blood had pooled all around my crotch and the spot is so noticeable even with my jacket tied at my waist. I start crying from the sheer embarrassment. Nobody commented on it so I’m not sure whether they were being polite or is the genuinely didn’t notice. I feel this is straight up a scene from Carrie there was so much blood. I can’t imagine nobody would have noticed. My boyfriend can be pretty oblivious to these sort of things and I got the vibe he didn’t notice. I’m so embarrassed. How do I come to grips with this? I feel like I can’t look his family in the eyes after this night. I’m completely mortified. Anyone have any advice of how to handle this? I feel like I’ve made such a bad impression and i feel physically ill from how bad that went. I’m not even sure how to bring it up to my boyfriend or if I should just trying to move past and pretend like it didn’t happen. Please help!

tl;dr

Bled through my pants at my boyfriends parents house in front of his family. Not sure how to handle the embarrassment of the situation."
"My (M/35) wife's (F/29) family (F&amp;M 35-56) skipped our wedding two weeks ago and my wife still can't cope with what happened.


I’m pissed.

I have never hated someone as much as I loathe my wife’s damn family.

We got married two weeks ago at our church. We had invited 82 people, 51 of which were my family, 26 were friends from work and church, and 5 from her family: her parents, brother, sister-in-law, and kid nephew in elementary school.

It was a beautiful ceremony - except that my wife kept breaking out into violent tears about every half hour all day from before the ceremony to the reception and even after we drove off to our honeymoon.

Why? Because those four piece of adult shits didn’t come to our wedding. A wedding which we planned to suit their particular tastes.

I have money. Enough money to have given my wife her literal dream wedding at the resort we honeymooned at. However, that resort had a dress code and was a three hour drive away so she decided to have a more informal wedding closer to home. She wanted to make sure her family felt comfortable. So we went from a $50,000 dollar wedding to a $1,000 dollar potluck, almost all of which went towards the cost of renting the church for the day. My wife didn't even wear the dress she liked since it would have been too formal for the occasion.

Well, fuck her family.

Her brother sent a text message a few hours before the ceremony saying he was tired from working the day before and didn’t want to drive an hour to the church. He's a librarian. Bullshit right? But nowhere near as maddening as her parents.

Her mom and dad, whom she lived with her entire life until now (my wife stayed with my sisters and her bridesmaids the night before the wedding to get ready), called and said they didn’t feel up to being around so many people at 10 am in the morning, nor did they want to drive the 30 minutes to the church because of bad traffic by the shopping center. They wanted to celebrate the weekend we got back from our honeymoon with a dinner.

We live in a more rural part of the south. Traffic doesn’t exist. A possible and rare fifteen minute delay from an accident on the road doesn’t warrant missing your daughter’s wedding.

I had never seen my wife cry before because she doesn’t. Stub her toe? Russian steel. Cat died? Introvert quietly. Her motto is that tears get in the way so she simply doesn't cry.

But she has. *For two weeks*. That's how absolutely devastated she is. She tried to remain cheery for the wedding, but she just wasn't in the mood, even though she went through the motions and everyone else at the wedding did their best to cheer her up. Once we left for the honeymoon though, it was just all tears until she passed out in our room, and then the rest of the week was spent lying in bed. She didn't even watch television. She just laid there, sleeping and crying and barely eating anything at all. She doesn't really talk.

I called a therapist to visit her in our home when we got back and was told afterwards not to leave her alone with her thoughts, so when I went back to work the next week my family and our friends have taken turns watching her. My cousin even brought kittens for her to play with and she just wasn't having it. Nothing in her life brings her joy. She has shut down completely.

So yeah, I really hate her family. I never want to see them again. I don't even want my wife to see them again after this, though I know I wont have a say in that. I spend every day worrying if she might kill herself because she feels abandoned.

I don't know how to deal with my anger. I don't know how to deal with my wife's depression. I don't know what comes next.

**TL;DR:** My wife's family didn't come to our wedding and now my wife is in a major depressive state. How do I handle this situation?"
"[UPDATE]- My (32/F) boyfriend (33/M) forged a document.


Original post: https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/3tu5il/my_29f_bf_30m_of_4_years_forged_a_document/

So when I left you all, I was supporting Jay as he picked up the pieces. It ended up that we were lucky that his transgression (forging a document) ended up being mostly covered up except that he was fired... He didn't end up with legal repercussions at least.

Jay ended up starting a new career teaching in our field. He's doing so well that he has been promoted recently to an associate professor position at a well respected college. Everyone loves him as a teacher.

There are so many more stories about this that I'm writing a memoir (but damn, I'm not a good writer!). Like the person that first reported him ended up being in love with me and I had to get a restraining order against him...

In sadder news, after supporting him for two years as he got his life together, I've fallen into depression and alcoholism. Apparently this happens sometimes to caretakers? I'm still keeping it together at work somehow, but could definitely be excelling if it wasn't for the drinking... I'm working on it and have just started going to AA, but it's definitely something that we need to work on in therapy more (which we both go to). 

I hope to provide you a super happy update where we both are crushing it in the near future, but for now, this is where we are at. 

Open to suggestions from those that have been through related situations.

Tldr: my bf messed up a few years ago and I currently feel the consequences. I need to forgive him. Looking for good experiences related to this."
"I (31F) is being called a bitch by my friend (38F) that's apparently going to the same vacation destination as me


I've (31F) known Amy (38F) for a decade now and we've gone on trips together on several occasions.

There's this festival, in September, I want to go to that involves booking tickets early, otherwise it gets sold out the day of. I mentioned to Amy that I wanted to go back in March and see if she would be interested in going and reserving tickets early when they become available online. Mid-April arrives and ticket reservations became available, I've texted Amy a friendly reminder to see if she was a ""yay"" or ""nay"". 2 weeks go by and not a word, I figure she was busy with work/life.

At this point I'm about to pull the trigger on a solo trip to the festival then a two day wine tour afterwards. I decided to text Amy again just to see if she considered the trip. She replied back and it turns out she already reserved tickets with her other friends, Jenny (35F) and Sharon (37F). To be honest, I was a bit upset she reserved tickets without me knowing since I was the one suggesting the festival first. In any case, I took the hint that maybe she wanted to hang with women closer to her age.

I went ahead with my solo trip idea. Fortunately, I was able to use some credit card points to save some money on the plane ticket and the festival sanctioned hotel.

Amy (along with Jenny and Sharon) procrastinates and only begun to look at plane tickets &amp; accommodations now. Apparently, they were appalled by the last minute prices, Sharon pulls out of the idea. Now leaves Amy and Jenny. Amy calls me and tries to convince me to share the hotel with them. I told her I have everything booked already and the hotel I have for the festival is single occupancy only. She said I should cancel it and I have to find a room that can fit the 3 of us. And she also invited herself &amp; Jenny to my post festival wine tour.

I bluntly but calmly told Amy I'm not cancelling my hotel and if she wants to join me on the wine tour idea, I have no intentions on getting shit faced or staying till closing time at any watering hole.

Her response was along the lines of =&gt; ""who said I wanted to get shit faced? If you don't want to drink, no one's going to force you. We're just trying to plan a group trip and you're being a bitch right now"" and she dropped the idea of joining the wine tour idea.

Honestly, I don't think she realized that she left me out of the equation when she was reserving the tickets or even wanted to go with me. I do feel used (and offended) that she only ""invited"" me when she needed another person to share the accommodation costs. I don't want to sever the friendship. How should I respond to what she said or make her realize that she left me out and it was never a group trip that included me?

TL;DR: Asked a friend if she wanted to go on to a festival and she ended up reserving tickets with 2 of her other friends. Then decides to invite me only to save on hotel cost."
"Husband (37m) flirting with my (38f) family’s friend at our vacation


We have been married for 16 years now and have two small kids. We met in school; he became an extremely successful surgeon and I was a nurse. When we got kids, we decided I should stay home with them and I stopped working. 

During the years his success got bigger and bigger and he got more and more self confident, sometimes even so to say full of himself. 
Women are approaching him a lot, but he never did anything except for talking to them. He is very communicative and curious by nature.

One week ago we went to our vacation with my family and old family friends. One of them is Rita (25), the daughter of my family’s friends. I have seen her last time as a kid only because she moved abroad and studied there. She is very beautiful, intelligent and stunning. 

As soon as my husband met her, he started talking to her all the time. Anytime they bump into each other at the hotel hallway for example, they will stay there for an hour and talk. 

We went for a lunch all together and he said in front of everybody that she is so smart and interesting, looking at her. When they talk, they both ignore any attempts of others to join the conversation because they seem to be interested only in what the other one is saying. 

He asks her bunch of questions all the time, even about her favorite food. When he found out it was fish, she invited her at our place to cook for her and then they agreed on cooking together. He asks her everything, about her hobbies, job, food, clothes, million questions. He told her the other day that our kids like her a lot because they can read people great, and stared at her fascinated. 

They discussed politics the other night and he (and he is very stubborn and opinionated) said she made him change his mind about something, and that almost never happens. 

I find it very uncomfortable because they are spending so much time together and talking all the time, as if they came together. Kids are mostly with me and my parents. 
My mum saw it too and talked to Rita a bit (as a joke) about ‘stealing him from his family’ and Rita said that his family was his problem, not her. 
She is also very flirty and my mum says that she likes guys that are a challenge to get. 

He says that I am jealous and overreacting, but it bothers me a lot. What to do? 


Tl;dr: Husband (37m) flirting with my (38f) family’s friend at our vacation"
"Guy (35/m) I've (31/f) been dating said something extremely alarming today, and I'm so in shock, I don't know how to react...


I've been dating this guy for a few months, and, recently, he's been trying really hard to provoke me to get a reaction for some reason. I've just ignored it and changed the subject every time without getting mad or anything. Just today, I was telling him how I was watching this dateline episode, and how this woman who went missing had so much common with me (name, appearance, job, most recent ex boyfriend's name, age) and how it was really eerie. His exact response to that was, ""I wish you went missing."" I'm not sure how to take that at all. I don't know if this is something I should actually take seriously, but I'm actually kind of concerned. Any advice as to how to handle this would be much appreciated.

Tl;dr: guy I've been dating said he wish I went missing, and I'm in absolute concerned and in shock right now. Need advice."
"SO[35M] and I[35F] were going under financially. I got a credit card to float us until we got it fixed. It's fixed. I don't know how to tell him what I did though.


About a year ago, my bf (of 4 yrs) and I were in a tough living situation, living paycheck to paycheck.  We racked up a lot of late fees on our accounts.  Had the water shut off one time (we were 67 cents short.).  We were planning to move but things were complicated.  It took much longer than expected.  We were supposed to move in May but didn't end up leaving until August.

In an attempt to ease our situation a bit until we could move, I applied for a credit card.. I didn't think it would be approved but to my great surprise it was.  The week I did this, we ran out of toilet paper.  I used it. I used it without his knowing to buy groceries, gas, toiletries.  I kept telling myself, when we move it'll be better and I can pay it off.

But then we moved and it didn't get better.  We had trouble selling our house so we were paying double utilities.  We had a massive water leak in the new place that cost a lot to fix.  The clutch on our vehicle went out.  Kid needed school supplies.

It was a mess to begin with but it just continually snowballed no matter what I did. 

I kept using the card for groceries, gas, toiletries.  That card floated us through a majorly shit year. 

Things are better now.  We have money.  I'm paying it off.  The balance is at $2700.  We have enough money now to pay it off outright.

Except he still doesn't know.  I need to tell him.  It's hurting me not to.  Even though that card floated us for a long time, and I think it was worth it, I shouldn't have hid it.  I think I was just ashamed that I wasn't  better able to make our shitty situation work out.  I was supposed to be in charge of money.  I fucked up.

I feel horrible, as I should.  He needs to know.  I'm afraid if I tell him he'll leave me.  That's a shitty thing to hide.

I need help.  I'm desperate to make this situation right.  I'm putting it off endlessly because I don't want to lose him.  It's just making it worse.

How can I approach this subject?  I wrote him a letter, but it feels cowardly.  It is.  We are not legally married, he's divorced and I was once going to be married and the whole idea of it just sucks.  Even still, we were wanting to spend the rest of our lives together.  I don't know that I deserve that now though.  Maybe that's overreacting.  Maybe thinking that it might possibly be overreacting is just wishful thinking.  

I can't think straight anymore.

Please send advice.

---

tl;dr - I used a credit card without SO's knowledge to float us through a shitty time.  I was ashamed and embarrassed.  I need to tell him though.  I don't know how.  I'm panicking and hyperventilating at the thought of losing him.  Please advise."
"My (30F) family member (65F) is visiting for 2 weeks and it's miserable, how to resolve?


My (30F) family member (65F) is visiting for 2 weeks and it's miserable. She will not stop complaining about the weather. We live near the arctic circle, y'all. It's not like summer on the eastern seaboard that she's used to, it's not even like North Dakota, it's a full-on ARCTIC experience. 40-55F is a typical HIGH. 

Other than that, it's been fine, but it is literally dampening the trip and I have no idea what to say. It's like complaining it's too hot in Florida or Phoenix in August, this should not have been a surprise. How do I survive and talk this one through? I have tried to plan activities and that's okay, but still, the constant rants. SIGH.

TL;DR: Guest staying for 14 days and is ruining visit with constant complaints about weather, how to approach this?"
"My (22f) boyfriend (m25) didn't save for his part of our vacation, which is in 3 days


For Christmas I bought my boyfriend (lived together 3 years) tickets to his favorite band, they're 10 hours away so I figured I'd talk to him about planning a week long road trip ending in the show, he was down. A road trip like this has been my dream for a long time, my boyfriend on the other hand could live without it but is still excited. He's beyond excited for the show. 

I decided that since it was my idea and I bought the tickets, I will cover 100% of the cost, roughly $3000. I asked only that he save enough to cover his usual rent and bills after the week off work and he agreed. Note that we split finances 50/50 and make the same amount of money. 

Trip is in 3 days, everything booked, my money is ready and we've taken the time off. Boyfriend has saved $0 and doesn't even have the rent this month. I don't know what happened and ""neither does he"". He won't take his vacation time to cover the money because he plans to take 2 weeks paid time off in December to play video games. 

So, my dream is probably out of reach now despite working my butt off at a job I hate to save for this trip. I planned everything to work perfectly and yet it didn't. 

Is it my responsibility to pay his part since the trip was my idea or should I ask him to take out his vacation? Is it too late for that? Can I even be upset or did I bring this on myself? Just sad and looking for advice. Thanks.

Tldr: boyfriend didn't save for his half of vacation coming up in 3 days, should I be upset?"
"My (32F) ex (33M) contacted me when my current boyfriend (34M) was out of town. How could I have handled this better?


I (32F) broke up with my ex of 2 years (33M) in November of 2017 because we were long distance and communication broke down (both of our fault). We both took the break up really hard because this was a really special relationship. I told him when I broke up with him that we could get back together if he moved here (as he’d agreed to do when I moved away) so we could work on the relationship and we never put a ""deadline"" on that. We’ve been in touch via email a few times about jobs and occasionally we exchanged 'I miss you' and 'I love you' in those emails but haven't talked/texted outside of that in well over a year. 

About 5 months ago I met a man (34) who I’m crazy about. He’s everything I could want in a partner and we have a healthy, loving, relationship that makes me unreasonably happy in a way I have never been in a relationship before. I knew within a month of dating him that should my ex ever turn back up, I would choose my new boyfriend over my ex, and I've been dreading that day since I realized it. My boyfriend left yesterday for a 2 week business trip, so of course, last night my ex texted me out of the blue. He told me he is in town about an hour from where I live and wanted to meet up for dinner/drinks. 

I thought about it, and although I want to see him because he’s a cool guy and I’d like to hear how he's doing, I know it would be awkward as soon as I tell him about my new relationship. So, I texted him back and told him that it was nice to hear from him, but that I didn’t think it was a good idea. I told him I’m in a new relationship and it wouldn’t be fair to my new partner right now, but that I hoped he had a good time in the city.

I was feeling pretty good about how I handled it, overall, even though I never heard anything back from him. But, some of my friends are telling me that it was immature/insensitive choice on my part not to go tell him in person and that I probably hurt him and messed up my chances at ever having him as a friend. I really didn’t want to hurt him or ruin a potential friendship down the line, I just wanted to be honest about where I’m at and didn’t want to risk jeopardizing my new relationship. My boyfriend isn’t here to talk through it right now, though I do plan to tell him about this when he gets home and we can talk in person.

I know there’s nothing I can do to change it now, but I guess I’m just looking for some validation that this wasn’t a totally out of line way to handle the situation. Alternatively, is there something I could have done better or a more considerate way to handle it? Should I reach out to him and apologize next time I’m in his city, just to show that I would like to stay friends if he wants to? 

TL;DR My boyfriend is out of town and my ex who I still care about texted me to have dinner. I told him no because I’m with someone new. Was this an insensitive thing to do?"
"I’m (27M) planning to marry my girlfriend (27F), and I hate her family so much it hurts


TL;DR My gf’s family blames me for taking her away and can’t let go.

I've been with my girl for about 4 and a half years, and it's been great. We've talked about marriage for awhile, and we're starting to put our plans into action--finances and whatnot. The only issue: her family and I do NOT get along.

This all started when we first met. To give you some context, we're both Asian, but I have an adult relationship with my family, who lets me be me and all that. My gf, on the other hand, has her parents clinging onto her every day, practically.

So yeah, I digress. We first met, and her dad told me: a man should always love a woman more in a relationship. Why? Because men are cavemen. If a woman loves them more, they would stray. All I said, was: ""Well, perhaps times have changed. Everyone is equal in this age, and I think that that logic would also apply in the inverse situation, right?"" He, as all Asian men of that generation, proceeded to limply repeat his first sentence. Recognising a debating expert when I saw one, I conceded and moved on quick.

And that's where it started. I could bring up a ton of examples, but I'll discuss the very most recent one. So another of his regular lines is that his daughter is ""too smart"" to be a housewife. Which I find to be irritating (because I've never insinuated that I wanted her to be one) and offensive (because my mom is a housewife, as he knows). So the other day, I was talking bout work. Told him I turned down an opportunity somewhere overseas. Said I had stuff here. He smugly tells me his daughter would leave in a flash without consulting anyone if it were her. She replies that she wouldn't, she wants to settle down for now. And he repeats it, she repeats that she has plans to get married, etc etc. He looks straight at me, and recounts the apparent story of a colleague that had her husband become a house-husband. This irritates me for a few reasons. So if my girl is too smart to be a housewife, what about me? I'm highly educated (way more than him, and more than my gf, though that's not something that's indicative of intelligence, ofc), and knowing that it burned me inside.

So that was a coupla weeks ago. I've told her to forget about her parents and I getting close (there are TONs of similar occasions), and even her cousins aren't happy with me because ""she spends time with me instead of them"". One of her cousins lives with the family as a leech and literally doesn't acknowledge me whenever we see each other. Her reason for all the hate? She heard us arguing over Skype once when I was overseas (no abusive or even vulgar language).

The sad thing is the effect this has on my gf. I love her to bits, and she's the only reason I've tried to build some sort of a relationship with her family. But they've repeatedly shot me down, and they're perpetually passive aggressive. Even a week ago, out of the blue, her mom sends a msg on group chat to my gf and her brother: ""tell your partners to stop getting tattoos. FYI, I don't like it"". You fucking kidding me?

My gf, to her credit, recognises that I've tried my best, and her family is incredibly old fashioned and refuses to let go. They're still texting her everyday asking her when she's coming back for meals, still clinging on as fucking much as they can. And now, I've given up. I'll turn up for official events, birthdays, new year's, etc. But not for anything else.

And it's gotten to a point where I wake up and the first thing in my mind is my hate for her folks. It's just been so exhausting carrying the burden for years. And in the future, I can't see myself allowing my children to have such toxic grandparents on their lives.

I hope everyone understands that I'm seeking genuine advice, and I've genuinely tried to see things the other way, etc. But they're the most small-town, Asian parents around. They can't let go."
"My boyfriend (19m) ‘pranked’ me (18f) by getting my friend (19m) to ‘confess’ his feelings for me because I’m about to move and my boyfriend wanted to see if I would cheat


Basically, I’ve been with my boyfriend for a year now, but we dated briefly my freshman year. I love him and our relationship didn’t have any major problems until now. I’m moving for college and the semester starts on the 26th so I’m leaving this following weekend, the 24-25. I was pushing it off till the last minute because while all my things are already there, it’s sad to leave obviously. I’m leaving to another state so my boyfriend and I are doing long distance. We’ve talked about this since the beginning of our relationship because I told him there was no way I would be passing up this opportunity and he respected that. He has no reason to not trust me and I have no reason to not trust him. I know long distance can be hard but I honestly had faith in us. Plus, he always reassured me and told me that nothing could make him not want to be with me. 

Last night, a group of us were all hanging out at a friends house. My boyfriend and my friend leave the room and then come back like 30 mins later. I think nothing of it. This friend had previously had a crush on me my junior year of high school but we talked it through and now he’s in a relationship with an amazing girl that I’m close with now too. Friend pulls me aside and asks to speak with me alone. Again, I think nothing of it and go with him.  He proceeds to tell me that he hasn’t gotten over his feelings and with me leaving he realized how much he loves me and he starts getting touchy. Obviously weirded out, I take steps back and keep asking him to stop touching me. The touching was just softly touching my leg (we were sitting when he started ‘confessing’) or playing with my hair. I knew something was up because I’ve known friend for a while now &amp; I know when something is off. He finally starts laughing hard asf &amp; pulls out his phone. It was in his pocket, with the voice memo thing going. he starts saying it was a prank and my boyfriend set it up.  

After boyfriend confirmed it he said he wanted to know if I’d cheat once I move “if given the opportunity”. Not only is this logic flawed, but I was so repulsed that he’d think that low of me. Why is he even with me if he thinks I would cheat “given the opportunity”????? I left the hang out early, went home, sent him a msg saying he doesn’t have to worry about me cheating because we’re over, blocked him everywhere and sent my friend a long msg explaining how hurt I am. friend came over this morning and apologized profusely, saying he now realizes how dumb it was and just thought I’d find it funny. I’m not angry with friend anymore, but I can’t seem to forgive my boyfriend. Everyone around me saying he’s just worried about long distance and i shouldn’t be surprised that he’s worried that there might be options when I leave. I get that but it just doesn’t align with all our conversations, he’s always been the most sure one. 

I feel like I might be overreacting. I don’t think he meant to hurt me, but at the end of the day he did. In my eyes, he attacked my character. I would never cheat on someone, and it hurts that he would think I’m capable of it. Not only that, he embarrassed me, because once I left early, everyone there found out because my boyfriend and friend told them. It all seems stupid to be mad about but I’m just so hurt. 

I’m sorry for rambling I’m just really hurt. I really do love him and a part of me wants to forgive him but I worry that that’s just a dumb move. Advice? Forgive and move on, or was I right to break up with him? 

TL;DR boyfriend got friend to prank me by telling me he loves me. He explained it was because he’s worried about our soon to be long distance relationship and wanted to see if I’d cheat “given the opportunity”. I broke up with him almost immediately and now kinda regretting it."
"Boyfriend subconsciously stares at other women


My (22f) boyfriend (27m) is always fixated on other girls who he finds attractive. We have been exclusively dating for 4 months now.

For example, I took him to a family party and there was a few family friends that I didn’t know. He would not stop staring at this 19 year old girl who was at the party. It was to the point where my family members were noticing it and pulling me aside to ask about it. Every time I’d look at him, his eyes were fixated on her across the room.

I don’t mind if someone I’m dating glances at someone attractive, we all do it. But physically staring at other girls without being able to stop is just disrespectful. 

So on the drive home, I told him that it hurt my feelings that he did that and it was embarrassing. He responded that he looked at this girl one time and didn’t notice her the rest of the night. So either he is lying or fully doing this subconsciously. He called me crazy and made it into something that I was overreacting about. He said that “10/10 people would’ve found this girl attractive” which is fine to say, but super hurtful and inappropriate in this situation. He kept denying it and telling me that he did absolutely nothing wrong. 

He was living a super provocative life before we started dating, like sleeping with a new girl every week for the past 2 years. So something tells me that he might not be ready to be out of this phase of his life and he might not be satisfied with being with the same person for months on end. 

How do I approach someone who doesn’t notice/denies their disrespectful behavior?

TL;DR - boyfriend stares at other girls to the point where my family notices and is in full denial/has no awareness of it"
"Boyfriend (29m) doesn't want me (24f) to have friends.


TL;DR at the bottom.

Hi everyone,

My boyfriend (29m) is Arab and I (24f) am from Canada. He thinks that I shouldn't have or need any friends because he says that he should be enough for me. He has asked me to block a lot of my friends and to delete Facebook messenger and Instagram because of this. He told me it's because he is jealous of me, but sometimes I feel lonely, especially because I've just moved to Poland to be with him and don't know anyone here except for him and his close friends and my coworkers, but he doesn't accept if I want to spend time with my coworkers either (I'm a daycare teacher).

He is okay with me occasionally hanging out with the girlfriends of his friends, but even then I have to ask him before I go out with them. I feel extremely contained and dependent on him, which isn't normally how I am. He also doesn't accept any of my friends if they are in any way LGBTQ. This includes some of my family members too. He told me that if I need friends then it's because he isn't enough for me, and he's baeically giving me an ultimatum where I have to choose between him or my friends. 

Is there a way that I can communicate to him that I need my friends in my life but that he is still enough for me? And to convince him that just because some of my friends are gay it doesn't mean they are interested in me?? (I've tried comparing it to straight ppl and saying that he has had straight girl friends without sexual attraction but he still doesn't get it...)

TL;DR: boyfriend says that I don't need to have friends because he should be enough for me; I deleted all social media and only talk to 3 of my friends now."
"I am a medicine student (F27) with only a student loan for income and my long distance boyfriend (M27) has had a well paying job with no rent for more than 5 years, is it wrong that I would like him to pay for more expenses on holidays/flights to visit him etc.?


Me and my boyfriend have been together for 8 years. We met at university when I was doing my first degree and trying to get into medicine. I got into medicine 5 years ago and have been living off my student loan ever since. My medicine degree is also in another country and he agreed that we would continue long distance and just see how it all goes, so far so good.

We try and visit each other every other weekend, mostly I have to fly to him because flights to me are very expensive and as a student I have a few more days off and can book better flight times.

He earns around 4x what I do with my student loan but with flights over to visit he wants to split everything 50/50 as in I pay my flights and he pays his.

We recently went on a road trip holiday and he booked all of the hotels. What I found out on the trip was he had booked hotels of over a 100E a night. The total cost of the trip was over 2000 E and I had paid around 600E by paying for food and bits and pieces. When we worked out the cost of the trip he split everything except 2 expensive dinners between the two of us which worked out to me having to pay 1100 E. He said to reduce the burden of the 500E I could set up a standing order of 40E a month to pay him back.

I don't know anyone in the same situation I am in being a student with a working boyfriend and don't know how to manage my expectations. Things were manageable for the past 5 years but now I am planning to move to him once I am done with my degree its feeling more complicated than before as I am now planning to move my life for him in a year.

\*\*TL;DR;\*\* : Bf earns four times what my student loan is. How much should I pay of our holidays/ flights to see each other (long distance)?"
"My parents flipped out on me over a vacation


So my parents m50 and f45 have planned a family road trip for us. I 20f have limited days off, but I managed to book off five days. I told them I would drive to the destination with them, but that I would book a flight home as I need to be back at work earlier than they do. Well, we are leaving tomorrow and I reminded them that I have to book my flight home and they FREAKED out on me!! My mom started crying her eyes out and saying she just wanted a ‘nice family vacation’ and how I shouldn’t fly home, that I should just cancel my work shift and drive back with them. They said I was stupid for spending money on a flight. My dad was yelling at me and accusing me of trying to ruin the whole trip. Then after I booked my flight they told me that I shouldn’t even come? I’m upset and they are super angry at me, but honestly I’m just confused as I never once said i was driving back. Like my mom is super upset I’m not gonna be there on the ride back, and they have refused to drive me to the airport if I do end up coming on the trip with them tomorrow. I don’t really know what to do???? 

TLDR my parents are mad that I’m not staying for the full trip on a family vacation, even though I told them I couldn’t from the start"
"my[f/28] friend [f/29] is getting married abroad and i am supposed to go to the wedding, but the costs are mounting and no one else i know can go. is it too late to bow out?


So, the title says it all, but for more color...my friend of \~10 years from college is getting married abroad in December. When she got engaged I was of course very excited for her and talked about going, she sent me a save the date, we’ve been on-and-off discussing her plans, etc. However, the trip is starting to give me a bit of anxiety for a few reasons:

&amp;#x200B;

* The tickets are expensive, on the low end $600 dollars (if you get a deal) and typically closer to 800. Plus hotel, something to wear to the wedding, a gift, etc. adds up fast. I am trying very hard right now to save and quit my job to go back to school for a few months, and this heavily impacts my saving/spending. I can technically afford it, but it’s a BIG expense and will set my plans back a bit.

&amp;#x200B;

* Our mutual friend from college just dropped out of going for personal reasons. Besides the bride and her fiancée, he is the only other person I know who is going, so I would be alone for a few days in a foreign country. I’ve traveled alone before and that’s fine and I’m sure it will be enjoyable, but that brings me to point three...

&amp;#x200B;

* My boyfriend visits his family on the West Coast for the holidays and so he won’t be able to come with me, and it doesn’t make sense for me to shorten a trip with such a long flight to come back and spend new years with him(right now we are spending thanksgiving, xmas, and new years apart, which kinda sucks). I also feel hesitant to spend so much money on a short solo trip when I’d much prefer to use some of that money to travel together at a different time.

Is it too late to bow out? Is there a tactful way to bow out and explain all of this? Or should I just suck it up and go?  


**tl;dr - My friend from college is getting married abroad and the costs are mounting, and the only other person I know dropped out. My bf also cant go. Is it too late to bow out?**"
"MIL (61F) keeps boundary stomping and my husband (36M) either doesn’t see it or doesn’t want to see it. Insists I (37F) shouldn’t blame him for his mother’s behavior. Does nothing to rectify the situation, instead telling me I don’t like his family and just want to ruin his time with them...


Profuse apologies for the wall of text.  I feel like I’m losing my mind and I just need to get it out.


TLDR: MIL keeps boundary stomping and my husband (36M) either doesn’t see it or doesn’t want to see it.  Insists I (37F) shouldn’t blame him for his mother’s behavior. Does nothing to rectify the situation, instead telling me I don’t like his family and just want to ruin his time with them. MIL has previously allowed our older child to play with a recently sharpened knife, play unsupervised on a road, and play with a can opener. She has previously allowed my youngest child who is prone to colds and has severe allergies that exacerbate his chronic asthma,  to play in water in the middle of winter, leaving him sopping wet for over an hour because “a little water won’t kill him besides which, he looks so well”.

Deep Dive: We’re in NZ for my husbands Grandmas 90th Birthday. The drinks are free flowing and my son (7M - lets call him B) has a tantrum thanks in part to my MIL. She asks to take him and my other son (5M) on a walk. I say no. She insists in front of them and they start begging to go, so I reluctantly rug them up to get them ready - it’s wet and cold outside. B who is having a rough time what with constantly being surrounded by new faces takes a little too much time to get ready (he doesn’t want to wear his gum boots - he wants to wear his shoes) so she leaves without him. He has a complete breakdown and starts screaming in the laundry. 

Usually B is the model child but every now and then he goes into to fight or flight mode when things get a bit much. It isn’t ideal - the screaming is guttural and heartbreaking and there’s no reasoning with him. I suspect that B is either on the spectrum or suffers from some sort of anxiety disorder, but because this type of extreme outburst only occurs occasionally and usually within the privacy of our home and has no discernible triggers, the Doctors are reluctant to diagnose him as such. Which is fine. I don’t need to label it or him, all I want is a way in which to handle the situation to best help him through it. 

Over time I’ve worked out that the best thing to do is to leave him where he is, tell him that I love him and that when he is ready and able, he is free to come out of whatever room he is in so that we can get on with our day. I check on him periodically to ensure he’s safe.  You may  think that I’m coddling him but it works so we do it. 

This time though, we’re surrounded by 30 odd family members in a relatively small house, the drinks are flowing freely, it’s loud but everybody is mostly either sympathetic or minding their own business. My husband seems to have forgotten how we normally deal with these episodes, so he keeps going in and threatening B with smacks and the loss of electronics during our flight home in a few days. I ask him to stop and tell him that his reaction is making things worse. He leaves, continues to drink and let’s me take the lead, which isn’t exactly what I wanted but I take it because I’m more worried about our kid at this point. 

My MIL returns and starts asking what’s happened. I explain and she insists that B told her he didn’t want to go. I’ve no interest in arguing with her about the effect of her choices on him,  so I instead ask her to let me handle it and explain why. I explicitly tell her to not go into the room. She agrees and I walk away.  I come back in 3mins to reassure and check on him to find her in the room talking at him as he screams. I walk away frustrated as the screaming gets markedly louder. She gives up and comes out having made the situation worse so I ask her AGAIN to please leave him alone.  3mins later she’s in there so I ask her YET AGAIN to leave him alone. She agrees but completely disregards my request as soon as I’ve got my back turned. You see where this is going... Finally I just sit in the room with B and basically guard the door as he screams, telling her to politely bugger off the next time she tries to get into the room.  

Then my husband comes in. He’s tipsy, accuses me of enabling bad behavior and threatens to drag our son outside. I tell him his anger is misplaced and if he lays a hand on our child I will leave him. He leaves. I reassure B that he is safe and loved. Finally, after much reassurance he settles. My husband returns, we take him to the bathroom, put him in the shower and get on with the evening.  I make it a point to ask my husband to apologize to B for his threats and reiterate that he is loved. By this stage I am frustrated and emotionally spent. It’s been three days of drinking and socializing. I’m not a drinker, and I’m not an overly social person,  so I put B to bed and join the odd conversation retiring early in the evening to a quiet corner with a book. Once it hits 11pm I slip away and go to bed. 

Morning comes and my hungover husband is carrying on like nothing happened. We take a trip to see the snow, just the four of us and while the kids are playing he asks me why I spent the previous evening “sulking and sullen”. This makes me really angry because he knows what happened. He was fucking there. I call him on it and he says he didn’t know what his mother was up to while  it was happening. He only found out much later when two of his cousins relayed to him, the series of events.  He insists that he shouldn’t be held accountable for his mother’s actions and that I should have told him it was bothering me instead of being sullen and sulking. I tell him that that’s not my responsibility. He is a grown man - husband and father and it’s not my job to teach him how to be any of those things. I question how he could see and hear our child having an episode but continue drinking, making socializing his number one priority. 

Before you lay into me for being a bitchy wife and control freak - I get it, he wants to enjoy time with his family. But it’s been three days of me running after the kids while he basically just drinks himself into a stupor along with the rest of his family. The drinking starts at 1230 and continues till midnight.  This is our first family holiday in over 18m and all he has done during any of the several get togethers, is take care of himself.  Again, I get it. It’s a family gathering, everyone is here and you’re keen to have a good time. But your kid is struggling and your wife is dealing with trying to settle him whilst simultaneously  trying to prevent your mother from making things worse. Stop drinking for ten fucking minutes and help her out.  

After much back and forth he accuses me of isolating myself and not even trying to socialize. I explain that by the time B was settled I was no longer in the mood to play catch-up. As it’s no fun being sober in a room full of drunks, I went to bed.  He says I’ve been distant at every event. I counter that I’ve been taking care of the kids. Someone has to watch them. They’re not old enough to be playing by a fucking lake on their own while all the adults are inside enjoying several glasses of wine. Someone has to be responsible and sober in case of an emergency.  He says they would have been fine. 

I can see we aren’t going to agree so I say next time he’s free to bring the kids on his own.  He interprets this as  “I never want to see your family” and accuses me of hating them.  And that’s where we are now. He’s not speaking to me because I “just don’t like” his family and am “trying to ruin his good time”.  I’m tired, frustrated and feeling mostly defeated. 

So Reddit, what did I do wrong? Should I just be letting shit slide even though my MILs behavior is often times detrimental to my kids?  How did I end up being the bad guy in this situation? I’m so confused, tired and hurt. 

I should note, my husband has never abused our children. We started popping them lightly on the bottom as punishment when they were in diapers, but that stopped as soon as we realized it wasn’t really having the desired effect. Now we use timeouts and confiscate toys/TV time.  Whilst he’s been a bit useless when it comes to parenting the kids during the last three days, my husband is usually a very good, hands on Dad. He struggles greatly with Bs episodes. We both did initially but as time has progressed I feel as though I’ve gotten better at handling him. Husband agrees that the way I handle it is best but backsides if he doesn’t see the situation deescalating within the first 5 mins."
"Fiancé (28/m) is possibly doing drugs and completely spiraling. Help.


This is going to be long and kind of strange so please bare with me.

I’ve been with my fiancé since 18. I’m 26 now and he’s 28. We got engaged last July. We have a small baby girl. 

In October, my husband took on a new job in finance. He’s been VERY stressed out. The job is much more high stress than his last job in means of demands and general time on the job. Even when he’s not at work he’s still there mentally and it’s all that he talks about. I don’t even know if my daughter recognizes him as a parent figure...he’s just there. They expect him to work 12 hour days and always be by the phone if they need him. I’ve tried to be supportive but there’s only so much I can do.

I started to notice that he hasn’t been sleeping. At all. His eyes are constantly huge and he talks a mile a minute when we are together. I thought at first maybe he was just REALLY high strung from work. Then we started having money issues. He took this job for the better money but now we are struggling to have chicken for dinner and food for daughter. I’ve had to start baby sitting out of my home to provide for her and I. Fiancé is in the bathroom ALL the time when home. Like every 15 minutes ALL the time. I haven’t found any paraphernalia but I’m highly suspicious. I grew up around addicts...I know how it looks. 

He’s also started leaving the house at weird times. I’ll wake up at 3 am and his car will be gone. 

I’m worried he might be having a mental break down and I’m pinning it on drugs but I can’t shake this gut feeling. I want to help him. Please give me advice, I am scared and don’t feel comfortable divulging this to people I hold near 

Tl;DR- fiancé is displaying strange behavior after new job. I am scared for baby and I"
"UPDATE: How do I (28F) convince my boyfriend (28M) to seek professional help?


[Original post](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/cs4o15/how_do_i_28f_convince_my_boyfriend_28m_to_seek/)

It didn't get a lot of attention but a lot of good things happened and I want to hype!

&amp;#x200B;

Right after posting, I got in touch with a cult expert. Our counselor had suggested that, off the record. He wasn't a part of a cult but the expert agreed he needs some HC deprogramming. We were sure he wouldn't agree to talk to him, so he advised me how to approach this just to open that door. Told me to be stern and try to discredit his ex, the self-help guru to discredit the bullshit she fed him. So I sat him down and we had a very hard conversation. It was actually a monologue that dragged on for what felt like hours. At points it felt like he would fall apart but I kept going.

&amp;#x200B;

Last night I reminded him he got that scar on his elbow cause he nearly died saving someone's life and she turned that into something shameful. Ages ago I had stage 3 melanoma, she all but called me a moron for going through surgery and chemo instead of trying natural remedies. She stands against the treatment that saved my life. For all we know right now she might be convincing someone they can cure cancer with herbs, like she was making him to go through cluster headaches without any medication. She's dangerous and did very bad things for his mental health. She had him convinced ""only strong people seek help"" is a lie fed to us by shinks cause they want our money. I reminded him she said he was the most damaged person in the world and quit her job to focus solely on him, while spending most of the time away from him, traveling off his pocket. He almost lost his best friend, lost both his parents, suffered a traumatic brain injury, went trough months of rehab, suffered the symptoms for another year and managed to survive all that. He was the strongest person I have ever met and only wanted to find some meaning in life, but she abused that and convinced him he's weak for her personal gain. I pointed out I could turn a blind eye and keep living this charmed life, but his wellbeing is far more important to me. I said I want my best friend of over 2 decades back and that can only happen if he talks to someone. I also told him I'm afraid that if he keeps waiting on my hand and foot, one day he will start resenting me and that's the only way he could ever lose me.

&amp;#x200B;

This conversation happened in the bedroom, he went to bed without saying a word. I wasn't sure if I was welcome there so I fell asleep on the couch, he joined me during the night. This morning something miraculous happened! I tripped all over myself, nothing new there. He didn't jump to my rescue, didn't spitfire if I need help with this and that, he teased me! He teased me for the first time in 4 months! We had this very bantery friendship and it stuck when we started a relationship. When he was triggered into regressing to the person she made, he was too terrified I would leave him if he did something like that. I was beyond happy and jumped his bones. He said if this is a treat for good behavior, he will have to do it more often. He made a joke! Then he said he will speak to someone and we set up an appointment in 2 days. I offered to join him on his first session, he said he will try to do it on his own, but might take my offer. This is huge! At least this morning he wasn't walking on eggshells out of fear I will leave him and he finally agreed to get the help he needs. I went to work and he didn't call to ask if I needed anything. He told me what he feels like having for dinner, instead of asking what I want and then getting everything cause I can't decide. Even asked me if I could pick it up, instead of him driving to a place I would pass anyway. This feels normal. I can't wait to get back home and enjoy him, however long this lasts. I know that very soon I will have my best friend back for good.

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR- I tried some deprogramming tactics and it worked. Last night I called out the bullshit the ""self-help guru"" fed him and pointed out I would give up this charmed existence in a heartbeat just to have my old friend back. I reminded him that if he keeps pampering me out of fear of losing me, one day he will start resenting me and that's the only way he could ever lose me. This morning he started acting just like in the old days and agreed to talk to someone, scheduled his first session for 2 days from now. Today, this feels like our normal relationship. Even if he regresses again tomorrow, he will be working on fixing his issues and I believe some day I will have him back for good."
"The guy I've just started dating has lied about a few things. Is this a red flag or is he just being insecure?


I've been seeing a guy for like a week. I'm 24f and he's 28M. On our first date, he made a couple of points to me: 

1) He said he had a masters degree. This was impressive to me as I had told him I'm weeks away from completing my Masters. 

2) He told me he was in the military full time. 

3) He told me he was living on base for that reason, with an additional property he uses just because he has money to burn. 

OK, well I just did my research on him online, LinkedIn, Facebook etc., and I found out a few things. 

\- He doesn't have a masters degree. But he does have a PG qualification. It's not far off but the principle is he lied about the degree and the topic he claimed to be super educated in.  

\- He is a reservist in the military, therefore he wouldn't be given full time living quarters on a base. 

\- His full time role is actually as a teacher. 

And now I'm annoyed because he constantly kept making out like he was better than me, posher than me (because he is in the military) and made some comments about how wealthy he is, and how poor I am by comparison. 

Is this a big red flag? Or should I read it as a man who is pretty insecure, and should I confront him about it? 

TL;DR: i think a guy is kittenfishing me or something. Either that or he likes to lie."
"My [24] boyfriend [24] is incapable of regulating his emotions. I feel like I’m in a relationship with a teenager.


Basically whenever he’s having a hard time or upset about something, he doesn’t talk about what’s on his mind - AT ALL. 

If I attempt to ask him what’s wrong or communicate that he’s not treating me right, he’s defensive. When I confront him, he says “I’m not doing anything / I’m not treating you in any way / I have nothing to say”.  I literally have absolutely NO idea what to say when that is his response. He’s not even acknowledging anything I’m saying. 

In my opinion, this is beyond someone simply being passive aggressive. It’s odd behavior. I believe he suffers from bipolar 2 disorder or something similar &amp; previous binges of heavy drinking and benzodiazepine usage has altered his brain chemistry. I am not a psychiatrist but highly suspect that there’s just something not right.
	
For example, last night he was in an ok mood. Then when I bring him dinner he doesn’t eat it. He told me he didn’t eat all day so I knew he was hungry. I asked him if there was something else I could make or if he wanted to order something. He said no. Later the plate is on my desk next to him so I ask if he’s going to sleep next to it ?? His response was he doesn’t give a fuck, he will throw the plate across the room. I went to bed shortly after. 
This morning he treated me like shit because I forgot to dry his work pants (Last night he didn’t even ASK me to wash them, he TOLD me they were dirty). I figured he was just in a bad mood because it was 4 in the morning and he was exhausted from his physically demanding job. I made his lunch while his pants were drying and he continued to be rude when I came back into our bedroom. 
After leaving for work, he almost immediately texts me asking “is this going to work”. Mind you he didn’t say thank you or goodbye to me before he left. This is a common occurrence in regards to his mood. Sometimes he will be very loving and sweet later in the day without truly acknowledging the previous behavior.  

This morning we have been arguing over text message. He’s implying that he’s unhappy but isn’t actually communicating his thoughts or feelings. Instead he is putting his energy into making passive aggressive statements.  I told him he should try to actually talk about what’s on his mind because something is clearly wrong. I  also said he should think about how his actions effect others &amp; he sent me an 👍 and 👌 emoji.
I asked him if he truly thinks that’s the best way to communicate his feelings, and does he expect me to just guess what his thoughts and feelings are. He then replied “R u stupid”.  
I just turned off my iMessage so I can’t see it if he messages me. I don’t think I should reply to that when he clearly isn’t  taking what I’m saying into consideration, let alone acknowledge me.

I’m really not sure what to say to him when he acts like this. It blows my mind that someone is capable of behaving this way. Not only does he seem incapable of regulating his emotions, but his responses never make any sense!

tldr; BF of 9 years is dismissive, insensitive, rude, and irritable. He refuses to talk about or acknowledge his feelings....and mine! Obviously I know people are going to say to just end the relationship but *I am truly, honestly confused by his behavior.* What would cause this? Is he just emotionally immature? Am I being dramatic?? What would you say to him?"
"My (26m) girlfriend (22f) wants my aunt (55f) to unfriend my ex (25f) on Facebook


My ex and I dated for about 2 years.  We ended things on good terms last year so I never saw any reason for her to unfriend any of my family on Facebook. 

Fast forward to my current girlfriend, she’s amazing and I love her.  We’ve been dating a few months now but feel this could be a huge red flag.  My aunt loves Facebook and her behavior actually annoying to other family members too. She will comment on every single thing she sees one of her friends posts.  If someone posts a new picture she’ll comment saying something small like “aw so lovely” or “this looks fun!”.  My uncle gets annoyed with her behavior because who would want someone commenting on every single thing?  

So my aunt added my girlfriend on Facebook last week I guess (*I don’t go on very often*).  After being friends with my aunt for a week she came to me about her concerns: my aunt comments on my ex’s stuff too much.  I asked what she meant and she explained what she saw (my aunt commenting on my ex’s posts) and I even asked how she saw the comments.  She said she happened to go to my ex’s page and saw my aunt commenting. I told her that “she does that to everyone and that I’m not sure what you want me to do”.  She got mad at me because she feels like I was being dismissive and said she feels my family wants me back with my ex.  

tdlr: my girlfriend would prefer that my aunt unfriend my ex on facebook so that my aunt will stop commenting on her page.  is my ex being controlling or am I being dismissive?"
"My (23M) girlfriend (24F) of 6 months is still speaking with her ex-boyfriend of 5 years. I have brought this up numerous times as a boundary issue, but the message isn’t being received. Am I jealous, insecure or wrong for wanting to walk away from this otherwise good relationship?


My girlfriend and I met on Tinder earlier this year. We hit it off from our first date and I was convinced early on that there could be something special. After 2 weeks of seeing each other, she mentioned I might know her ex-boyfriend of 5 years. Indeed I did, he was a mate of my older brothers who I had some friendly interactions with, but I would only consider him an acquaintance (I mean, i didn’t even know he had a GF). I told my girlfriend that this was not an issue for me as I barely knew the guy. I felt I wasn’t cutting the mans grass as they had been split since late last year. If she was cool with it, so was I.

Fast forward a couple of weeks to one of our mid-week dates. I noticed that she was very pre-occupied with her phone while we were enjoying a game of bowling. Later at dinner, she began texting while we were waiting for our meal. She was speaking with her ex and filled me in on the conversation, which was him sending aggressive texts demanding responses and answers to his questions. This sent off alarm bells for me and I was immediately so surprised by how volatile he was towards her. I also told her how insulting and disrespectful it was to me that she would be messaging her ex while on a date with me. This was the cause of our first argument and unfortunately it wasn’t the last about the same topic...

I told her honestly that I saw some potential between us, but if she wasn’t ready to move on from her previous relationship then I understood and would give her time and space. I made it very clear that I was interested in her but I also wouldn’t invest my time and effort into being a rebound relationship or just a second option to a clearly emotionally abusive ex. She understood, we took some time, and she told me she wanted to move forward with me and would forget about her ex-boyfriend. This was my first time setting down my clear boundary. I told her quite plainly that if she saw a future with me then she would need to make the choice between me or her ex. If she wanted to continue to speak with her ex then that was fine, but she couldn’t expect me to stick around as I was uncomfortable with it. She chose me and promised to go at least one month with no contact to see the results. 

Fast forward another couple of weeks and she started speaking with him again. It was obvious whenever they spoke as she would put the back burners on our relationship and would tell me that she wasn’t ready to move on so quickly or would cause a fight/argument over nothing. He was clearly planting ideas in her head and I was caught off guard by these instances as everything had seemed to be plain sailing before this. When I was on her phone sending a text, I saw that one of the recent conversations was wth her ex who incidentally had a do not disturb symbol next to his name. When I questioned her about it, she admitted to speaking with him again but begged me to understand it was only to get a $3,000 debt paid back to her. This was my first time hearing of this and I was skeptical. I told her that she had broken my trust by not telling me about this earlier. I once again told her she was putting the feelings of her ex over her current boyfriend and I was left as a second option. I told her she had hurt me and I needed time to think. We had a break for a week with no contact, instigated by me. 

During this time, she messaged me constantly and apologised for her wrongdoing. She insisted it was only about the money and she didn’t want to lose me over something so trivial. I agreed to meet up to discuss what had happened and how it had impacted me. The apologies and crocodile tears followed, and once again I had forgiven her and agreed to move forward providing she cut contact with her ex.

And now we skip forward to present day. I have been looking after my girlfriend while she is sick with the flu. She asked me to send a text to her boss asking for the day off due to illness. While typing this a message came through from her ex-boyfriend. Curiosity got the better of me and I looked through the messages. It was a long conversation and in it they had discussed meeting up to exchange old clothes, talked about where their relationship went wrong, how he was dealing with his mental illness and just general chit chat. Even though I was livid that this has been going on behind my back, I was somewhat comforted that there was nothing sexual or alluding to a reconnection. He did however mention many times that he wanted her to break up with me as he couldn’t stand her being with one of his best mates (seriously, I don’t know this guy that well. I have seen him twice in the last three years). 

I haven’t brought this up with her yet as she is very sick and needs to rest. My initial thoughts are that I am being walked all over and I need to end the relationship. My understanding of the situation and general detachment seems to have set me up to be complacent to the fact that this was going on. I didn’t want to appear as jealous or insecure, so I let more than I normally would slide. I genuinely believe I have been pushed too far and I need to walk away to preserve some of my dignity. My personal belief is that once you commit to a new relationship that is the end of anyone you had in your life previously. If you have children or financial obligations (e.g mortgage, child care etc.) then I can understand maintaining contact. But the communication my girlfriend is having is in-appropriate in my books and she is clearly going against my wishes despite how it will affect me. Once again showing me that she cares more about her ex than she does about me.

TL;DR:
GF is still talking to ex despite me stating multiple times how uncomfortable it makes me. GF agreed to go no contact with ex and I have found further texts today showing communication between them.

Just wanted a second opinion on this to make sure I’m not going crazy here. Am I being overly jealous and insecure? Or is this a clear case of too many red flags and I need to skedaddle while I have my sanity in tact?"
"How do I (26F) tell my friend (23F) I won't be attending her weeklong wedding plan/bridal party trip? She is already upset with someone else for declining.


My (26F) friend (23F), I'll call her Rebecca, of over a year is getting married next year (yay!). I'm excited and happy for her and all that jazz but the issue I'm running into is that she can be rather extravagant with her money while I'm just not. We work together so I know her income.

She's been going through several ideas of how she wants to spend time with her bridal party, ideas like a trip to Vegas, road tripping and touring wineries, etc. All these ideas take place over the course of a week and the end with the wedding in a different location.

We live a plane flight away from her wedding venue, let alone anywhere else she'd want to take a trip to and I frankly am not keen on the idea of using all my vacation time and money on this trip. I'm already on board with buying plane tickets, lodging and a bridesmaid dress and some bridal party activities, helping decorate, whatever but this just feels like too much for me.

Another friend (22F), I'll call Jessica, feels similarly and told her that she would be in town several days for the wedding but couldn't afford to take a trip around to these places. Rebecca immediately told her she's no longer a bridesmaid and is pissed.

Now, she can have whoever she wants as a bridesmaid, and if the bridesmaid standard is to go on this trip well so be it, but I know she's going to call tonight to complain about Jessica not going on the trip and how shitty it is and then I'll also tell her I'm not going on this trip.

I would've already told her but she hasn't actually told me her plans for the wedding week, I'm getting this information from other people and figured I'd let her know that I can't go but I haven't seen her (she's been working at a different department temporarily).

So what do I do, I want to handle this as graciously, with as few hurt feelings as possible?

TL;DR Friend wants many activities for wedding and is upset with people who can't go to the particularly expensive activities. I am one of those people and still have to tell her."
"My husband (M32) has no ambition and it is driving me (F31) crazy


My husband voluntarily left his job over a year ago because he hated it (long hours, unfulfilling). We agreed that he should take the time to find a good, long-term fit so that we can buckle down and pay off the rest of our debt. However, this was over a year ago, and he still isn't working. 

Every time we talk about it, he says that his goals are more abstract, or that we aren't in a financial situation to achieve them, but he doesn't take any action to achieve them. I'm realizing that he won't take any action, he is expecting things to just happen for him.

He treats himself like a victim because he can't get a job, but in a year, he has put in less than 50 applications. We can barely make ends meet on my salary alone (plus I work two jobs). I hate my jobs, and have been waiting for us to be stable so that I can go to a (fully funded with stipend, but not enough to support us) graduate program. I am so frustrated with our life. 

I know that he's feeling beaten down by job hunting, but I feel so exhausted. 

TL;DR: My husband hasn't worked in over a year and doesn't seem to want to and it is making me crazy."
"My fiancee[F 26], sometimes acts like a child?


Tldr: My fiancee cannot take any criticism without getting upset and throwing a tantrum.

For example, I calmed mentioned today that cutting chicken in the pan is marking it. If I ask her to hang her wet towel up after a shower if she forgets, etc... she gets in a huff, sometimes slamming doors and screaming go away, leave me alone, etc... 

These little things don't matter and I don't say them in a way that could be considered angry or annoyed. What can I do? What should i do when she acts like this?"
"My boyfriend (33M) of nearly 4 years has a daughter (5F) who I (25F) am not allowed to meet.


Let's start with some backstory; my boyfriend had a child with another woman five years ago. They were never an official couple and my boyfriend describes the relationship as a ""summer fling"" because they live far away from each other. During her pregnancy, she threatened abortion and pushed him away making it very difficult for my boyfriend to be part of anything. They decided to cut ties romantically during the pregnancy but my boyfriend was always committed to being part of his daughter's life. However, she has been very difficult to co-parent with and my boyfriend rarely sees his daughter. When he does, the mother only allows him to meet her at a playground for four hours and she makes him give her a month's notice. She also has never let him be with their daughter alone and supervises the visit the entire time. There is no court involvement.

I started dating my boyfriend when his daughter was almost 2 years old. It started casually but I ended up moving in with him within the first year. When he told his daughter's mother about us, she was not happy. She refused to meet me or allow me to meet their daughter. At first, I was understanding and figured that she was just being protective. However, by the second year of our relationship she had attempted to get my boyfriend to take her back multiple times. He told her that he was happy with me and she would get angry and ignore his calls when he called to talk to their daughter. When she does answer, she tells him that his daughter does not want to talk and ends the call.

Fast forward two more years, my boyfriend and I now have a 3 month old son. I am now the mother of his daughter's half-brother. I still have not met his child. When my boyfriend told her we were having a baby, she stated that she would not be telling her daughter about him and she refuses to let them meet each other. I don't know what to do. Any advice? Do I have the right to be frustrated? Is it wrong of her to hide our son from her daughter and not let our children meet?

TL;DR my boyfriend of nearly 4 years has a 5 year old daughter and his child's mother refuses to let me meet her even though we now have a 3 month old son."
"My [F27] husband [M32] has ghosted on our marriage


I apologize that this is so long. This is the first time I have typed everything out. 

Please help me figure out how to respond to my husband. I went out of town last Thursday with my friends for a weekend and my husband of 5 years (together 11 years) moved out behind my back. I just want our marriage back.

While I was in another state he called and told me Friday that he got a Uhaul and was already out. He took my cat. He told me he saw no future with me because of essentially three reasons:
1. I am messy.
2. We live in a dumpy house that we rent from my parents.
3. I am Christian while he is atheist. 
He said he is not happy and wants some time away to figure things out. I must have cried so hard he felt guilty and brought my cat back but when I came home all of his stuff was gone and he did not leave a note. I did not try to contact him for all of Saturday and most of sunday to honor his space. 
On sunday night I left him a short voicemail to say thank you for returning my cat and that I love both him and the cat and I hope he is okay. Today he texted and said that he was sorry he took the cat. I sent him a two sentence text saying I am thankful he brought her back and that I understand he needs space but at some point he will need to talk to me. He responded okay today at 11 am but I have not heard anything back. 

For background info you can check my post history things have not been good these past two years. He was diagnosed with testicular cancer and he is a little over a year and a half cancer free. He lost one testicle. I have tried to support him the best I can. I got him into counseling and I organize all of his appointments and follow ups. I pay all of the medical bills as well. 
Ever since the surgery he has not been himself. He has no desire to have sex or masturbate. He refuses to be cuddled or touched and he chooses to sleep by himself on the couch so that nothing is touching him. He says that he is upset with himself about not having a good job and owning a nice house. Both of these things were never important to me. We both see separate counselors and we try to work on our communication. I have tried to get better at cleaning and now have weekly chores I complete. I have also tried to be less anxious and less demanding of him. None of these things are ever satisfactory for him. About two weeks ago he mentioned wanting to move out. I was devastated. He wanted to move into his rich uncle's appartment since it is expensive. He said he would wait to talk to his counselor on Friday. Instead it appears he used that time to move. I just recieved his ""mail forwarded"" letter today so he must have planned this at least a week in advance. 

I am devastated I am trying not to lash out in anger and to empathize with him. I am so lost and hurt. I gave him a decade of my life and now I have nothing but two cats and an empty house. What should I do? Should I continue to try and talk to him? Should I talk to his Mom? What is going on in his head? 

TL;DR After I left town for the weekend my husband moved out and will not talk to me. He was diagnosed with testicular cancer a year and a half ago and has never been the same. How do I get him back?"
"Am I right for choosing my dog over my girlfriend?


So, I want to start this off by saying that I love my 21 year old girlfriend. Or I thought I did, at least. We've been together for a little over a year, and I had begun to look at rings and everything.

And I've known since the beginning that she doesn't like dogs at all. She doesn't want one in the future. Just simply doesn't like them, which is fine with me. I am willing and able to live without any future dogs.

But I already own a German Shephard. And I have since I was 13(I'm 22 now). My mom bought her specifically for me wheb my dad left. Me and my dad weren't really close and it didn't really bother when he divorced mom and left, but I wasn't going to tell mom that.

But Delilah, my dog, was 3 months old when I got her, and she's been with me ever since. I've always taken care of her. I feed her, wash her, take her outside, play with her, etc... I have never asked for any help on taking care of her, except when I was younger and my mom bought her food.

When I was 15, I had to stay with my dad at his new house for 3 weeks during summer break. I took Delilah with me, he didn't like that, as she was an inside dog and he didn't want her hair on all his stuff. We argued a lot during my stay there, and it all culminated in him hitting me for the first time. He ended up dislocating my jaw and breaking my nose, but the only reason he stopped fighting was because Delilah bit him and defended me.

So to say that I love my dog is an understatement.

Now though, my girlfriend has said since the beginning of our relationship that I should 'get rid of my dog' and get a cat. I thought she was saying it jokingly at first, but it has since become a big issue.

She refuses to come to my home because of Delilah. She has held off moving in together because she has said that she doesn't want to help with taking care of Delilah. She constantly says I should get rid of her. 

Eventually, I came to the conclusion that it is an unhealthy relationship to be in, and it has to come to end somehow. Either breaking up with my girlfriend, or getting rid of my dog. 

I've come to my decision to end things with my girlfriend, but I guess I just want reassurance that I am doing the right thing.

TL;DR: Had a dog for almost a decade, girlfriend wants me to get rid of it. I'm going to choose my dog over her."
"A work manager (43M) asked me out to drink. I (29F) reported it.


So in my past history I was approached my a 55 yr old manager when I was 26 and it ended in an emotionally abusive relationship. I am still deeply affected by it today. 

An assistant manager messaged me on fb 3 days ago throwing out hints that he wanted to know if I was single and telling me he sees tons of potential in me and wants me to work with him so I can be a lesser level of manager. Our chat ended there.

Yesterday I woke up to a text telling me he hopes I'm doing better than him. He started talking about how he hates being single and how its led him to alcoholism. He said he thinks I'm the one who gets him and was asking questions like jokingly asked if I'd marry him. He asked me to do shots with him at a bar that night and then follow it to a hot tub place that's known for being a hot spot where people have sex but we did not discuss having sex. This immediately took me back to what happened before and I was not making that mistake again so my instinct was to go to the manager who I trust the most and get her 2 cents. She told me not to go, block him and give our chat logs to the head manager. I wrote a statement and am giving the chat logs and letting them decide what chat they need to have with him. 

My friends are making me feel like I was wrong to speak up because of the personal problems this guy is having in his life. I talk to them Sunday. What do you think I should do?

**Tl;dr An assistant manager at my job asked me out and I reported it. People are making me feel like I was wrong to do so.**"
"I (23F) don’t want to be around my dying grandmother (78F) or help with post-death proceedings


My grandmother has been in out of my life since I was born, depending on how long she would get along with my mom. My family has been a hot mess since as long as I can remember, and my grandmother has always been the root of it. She married my grandfather at 18 out of desperation to leave her 9 younger siblings. He started beating her 3 months into the marriage, but she didn’t give birth to my mom until 5 years after they had been married. She was madly in love with my grandpa, who didn’t love her at all in return, and as a result she viciously abused my mom and aunt. My mother suffers from PTSD, depression, and paranoia due to my grandmother’s physical (she stabbed her in the head with a meat fork), mental, verbal, emotional, etc etc abuse. Needless to say, my mother was not the best mom she could have been to me because of it. My grandfather was absent during all of this, an alcoholic. By the time my uncle was born, a son whom my grandpa had always wanted, their “relationship” settled and my uncle suffered none of the abuse his older sisters did. My mom got pregnant at 16, was forced to keep the child by my grandma (essentially ruining her life), and my grandparents divorced when my mom was 18. But my grandma still loves my grandpa until her dying breath, as he’s currently refusing to visit her in the hospital either or help pay for her burial proceedings.

To say my grandma and I have a relationship is a large overstatement. I was essentially wallpaper to her. Out of about ~10 grandchildren, my grandmother’s astute favorite is my older sister. Conventionally pretty, petite, lighter skinned, and kind of slow, my sister was the object of near fetishism for my grandma. Although my grandmother was mean as hell and rude my entire life, she fawned over my sister, giving her heirlooms and taking her out while I stayed in cars and at home in the living room as a kid. My grandmother insulted my skin tone, my hair texture, and my mother constantly whenever we were around her.  Needless to say, I didn’t care for her, but I didn’t hate her. Every time we visited her, we were kicked out because she and my mom would fight. Every time we visited my grandpa’s house for an event, the event was ruined because my grandma would show up and start fighting someone or everyone. She was instigative, loud, and incredibly narcissistic. As she got older, she entered the “victim” stage as no one wanted to be around her except my sister, but sister got tired of her shit too and left my grandma (who she had been staying with) when I was around 18.

My grandma didn’t care about me. She really didn’t. She never called me, spent time with me, or asked me how I was doing when I was growing up. When I became estranged from my mom right before high school graduation, I attempted to build a relationship with her, but every conversation was about her problems or my sister. Not kidding, she would only call me to ask why my sister isn’t returning her calls, and then spent the next 40 minutes talking about how fucked up her life was. I was literally in an apartment by myself with no help and my grandma didn’t give a shit. And I didn’t ask, because why would she? She lived off food stamps, was in and out of homeless shelters, and had no money. But a little care would have been nice.

The same trend continued while I put myself through college. No help from anyone and my grandma only calling me to complain about once a year. A year ago I found out something that hurt me deeply. My grandma had been working on a state injury lawsuit for years (since I was kid) and she finally won it while I was a sophomore. She lamented to me how she was sorry couldn’t have done more for me while I was on my own, which was the closest I’d gotten to her viewing me as a person. She said she had given a few thousand to my sister (of course) and a thousand to my brother who was in and out of jail. I thought it was interesting how her only grandchild and the only family member to go to college wasn’t given a second thought, even though she had told me a couple of times before that she would give me a portion to go towards school. I’m not salty she didn’t give me any money, but that is kinda bogus. I don’t know why she told me, because my sister hadn’t, and probably for that very reason. 

So now the cancer my grandma had when I was a kid has returned and is stage 4. I’m currently driving to the hospital an hour away, not because I want to, but because my mom and sister keep calling me to visit and help clean grandma’s messy hoarder apartment since she won’t be returning. She’s being moved to hospice today because the hospital needs room. I told my mom a week ago that I will attend her funeral, but I don’t want to be around my her dying and I don’t want to go to her apartment, but they’re refusing to respect my feelings because “they have their issues with grandma too” but “it’s about humanity, and someone has to do it.” My cousins aren’t visiting her or part of this at all, nor is my aunt or grandfather. My grandma made it her personal mission to ostracize everyone she came in contact with, so as she lays dying, she’s alone. I cannot force myself to care. I’m 23, working full time, and still trying to get my life together on my own. I have little exposure to death, and I’d rather when I do, it be out of love and sadness because of my relationship with that person. And because my grandma has no burial insurance but insisted on being buried, they’re asking me to chip in. I’m broke. And I don’t want to throw my money away on that. But I do feel a strong sense of guilt because that is my grandmother, and I have attempted to understand why she is the way she is. I have my mom figured out, and have accepted her and her issues, but my grandma is another story. And I kind of don’t want to. Am I being heartless?

TL;DR: Grandma is probably going to die within the week, and I don’t want to be around her or help clean her hoarder apartment. I have a long history of either being ignored or disrespected by my grandma, and don’t have a relationship with her, and I honestly am not sad about any of this. I’m visiting her today on the insistence of my sister and mother and will go to her funeral out of respect, but don’t want to be involved any further."
"I (19F) just found out my boyfriend (24M) has multiple restraining orders against him.


So for background information I have horrific trust issues. I am terrible at believing anything anyone says and have a hard time communicating. My boyfriend and I have been trying to work past this and lately I started to feel like maybe it was finally going somewhere.

Recently we were with some of his friends and he started telling this story that basically mentioned an ex had a restraining order against him. He didn't seem to be ashamed of this at all. This immediately worried me but I didn't ask him to elaborate as we were with other people. Later he told another story about yet ANOTHER ex that has a restraining order against him. I wanted to vomit.

I've sort of been letting this information sit for two weeks as I have absolutely no idea what to do nor do I want to accept what's happening. I know this is a huge red flag and I know I have to leave immediately but I'm having such a hard time accepting this fact and I don't know how to bring it up. I'm just at a loss for what to do right now.

Tl;dr: I found out my boyfriend has multiple restraining orders against him and need help handling this information."
"SO [26m] grossed out by my [26f] menstrual period. Trying for a baby soon.


Reposted because rules were broken. Throwaway account. Been together 6 years, married for 4 of those. We are going to start trying for a baby in a few months so I have stopped taking birth control. I've been on hormonal birth control for about 10 years to keep my bleeding and cramping in check. Modern medicine did wonders for the extreme pain and excessive bleeding I experience. On the pill, menstruation has been almost blissful. Off the pill, menstruation is the bane of my existence.

Today, I bled through my tampon and through my work pants. SO works in the same male-dominated industry as me so maybe that's where his behavior is stemming from? idk. They all act super macho and manly. 

I work with all dudes, so this was awful to say the least. Luckily my work pants are dark enough to hide it because I could not go home to change. I texted my husband from the bathroom telling him what happened and how I hope none of the guys notices. He texted back, ""ew"". I felt embarrassed, my own husband is disgusted by me. I can't control this shit. I don't want to deal with it but I have to. I know it's gross, but come on.

When I got home from work I texted him I was upset by what he said and he texted that I was overreacting. I replied, ""do you know how embarrassing it is be the only female at work and bleed through your pants? It's not like I can ask someone for a tampon or ask my male boss if I can leave to clean myself up and miss about an hour of work between driving home and back. I stopped taking the pill so we could start our family and pregnancy is going to be a lot more gross than a little blood on pants. what if we have a daughter and she has her period? are you gonna tell her it's gross?""

All he responded was that I needed to chill and he would talk to me when I was calm. I have not responded because I might lose my shit at him.

I am honestly considering going back on the pill because if he cannot handle some period blood and is making me feel embarrassed for something I have no control over then he probably will not be ready for dealing with birth and a baby. I am sacrificing my health for US, I am dealing with ridiculously painful cramps and super heavy bleeding for US, this situation would not have happened if I was on the pill. He's away for work and won't be home for weeks. Lucky for him because my hormonal ass came home and angry cried about this. How do I get him to understand that this is a part of life and he needs to suck it up and deal?

tl;dr I bled through my pants at work because I stopped taking BC pill so we could have a baby. He thinks it's gross and is not sympathetic at all. He says I am overreacting because I am mad at his response. We want to have a baby but he can't handle a little period blood. What do?"
"Would it be wrong to crash my boyfriend’s “beer night”?


My(23F) boyfriend(25M) goes to a specific bar/bartender once a week (for the last few months) for his “beer night.”  I was cool with that, as I get that everyone needs time to themselves and I am not a huge beer drinker anyway. But I asked him this week if I could go with him because I wanted to drink some beer and eat some food, and he completely freaked out and said that that is his time alone and that he doesn’t want me to go. I thought that was a weird reaction, and then I found out that he and the bartender had become friends on social media and were sending a lot of messages back and forth. He told me that they are just friends and that they just vent / send each other memes/funny pictures/etc. I also saw that he had said some mean things about me, but I get that everyone needs to vent sometimes, and he doesn’t have a whole lot of friends. They also text almost constantly. 
He has assured me that they are just friends, and he has never cheated on me before so I don’t know if he would. (We have been together for over 3 years)

Tl;dr: my boyfriend doesn’t want me to go to his beer night, because he may be into the bartender. 

So, would I be an asshole for going to his “beer night” anyway, or should I just leave it alone?"
"All my (32M) wife (30F) of 4 years wants is to have sex


 

My wife recently lost a close relative. She had a couple of days of mourning and ever since then all she wants to do is have sex (close to a month now). Before this we used to have sex 2-3 times a week. Pretty vanilla. She really gave blowjobs and have never had anal. Over the last two weeks we have been having sex 2-3 times a day. Last Saturday we had sex 5 times. Every time she wants to give blowjobs have been trying anal too.

Of course, I have been enjoying this. After a while everything gets a bit raw, but whatever. This is a coping strategy of course, but is it normal or does she needs therapy?

TL:DR Wife's close relative passed away. She has changed from vanilla sex to increasing frequency and changing type of sex. I am unsure if she needs therapy or if it OK to use this as coping strategy"
"My [26F] BF [25M] is seriously mad about me wearing earplugs to sleep and slept on the couch tonight over it


So, while I was a kid&amp;teen I lived in a very quiet area but still had huge constant issues to fall asleep. I have always had massive problems to 'switch off' my mind like that, and I would regularly lie awake for 3+ hours before I finally fell asleep. I think it has something to do with my (mild) ADHD.

Finally I started living in a large student dorm and wore earplugs so I wouldn't be randomly woken, and found out that earplugs generally help me to fall asleep much faster. Ever since, I've worn them almost every night, even in a quiet environment. Something about that complete silence and isolation makes it possible for me to fall asleep after only about 30 minutes.

Fast forward, my current BF (of 5 months) hates the fact that I wear earplugs to sleep every night. When we started sleeping together I just gave him a short explanation for why I will always wear them even if it's quiet because I fall asleep faster. He seemed ok with it at first. But ever since he would, with increasing frequency, tell me I just need to 'wean myself off them' or just 'try it without them'. And in the last weeks he's been almost agressive about it. Usually when we're in bed and getting ready to doze off I'll tell him I'm 'plugging in' now and if he has any last words lol. And I just noticed him getting kinda annoyed at those moments and he'd roll over to face the other way or stuff like that.

Last night he brought it up again and said 'it's really quiet in the house nowadays, I bet you could sleep without them' and I said 'I told you, it helps anyways' he just got up, grabbed his stuff and moved to the couch. I was like wtf. I just slept alone because I didn't feel like going after him. He gets up earlier than me in the morning so I haven't seen him since. I genuinely don't understand what bothers him so much about it, when I ask what the problem is he just says I shouldn't need them and have gotten 'addicted' to them...

does anyone understand what his problem is? 

\---

\*\*tl,dr:\*\* I always sleep with earplugs because it helps me to fall asleep much faster. BF hates it and tries to get me to stop using them, slept on the couch tonight. What is his problem?"
"My husband (26M) and I (25F) are running out of things to say to each other


I think after 7 years together, my husband and I have finally reached an impasse. We've always been very different, but before there was a lot to discover about the other person. Now, if we want to talk, it either becomes a small argument or it's talking that leads to sex. None of the fulfilling conversations we used to have. 

Over the years we've both delved into our respective hobbies and interests, and while we listen to each other ramble about them here and there, there's no common ground. We talk about finding a new hobby or interest but haven't found anything yet. It's definitely an option though. I think there's some apathy on both sides we have to overcome. 

Our usual routine is that after work, we watch TV over dinner and make small talk, then we sort of go our separate ways (he plays video games and I do crafts or something). We go to separate rooms because the games bother me too much to be around them. And then later he initiates sex and sometimes we do it, and go to sleep. It feels bleak written out like this. 

Any advice in rekindling the spark? We do go on dates once a week and those are fun, but there are still 6 days in the week where it's hard to connect. 

**Tl;Dr husband is very different from me and we have a hard time connecting**"
"My roommate [32/F] and I [27/F] are arguing because her cat likes me better than her


So I'd like to tell you the story and then ask for your opinion, because I may be in the wrong here, so please do let me know...

I've been living with my roommate for 2 years (but we've been friends for longer), and about 9 months ago I came home to find she'd bought a new kitten. I was a little annoyed she hadn't asked me first but maybe she just knew I was an animal lover and would be fine with it (which I was, don't get me wrong). 

He was 10 weeks old, so still very young and needy. My roommate was working away for 9-10 hours each day, but I worked from home, so I could hear him crying all the time for attention. I didn't want to intrude because I knew I wasn't his owner but at the same time I couldn't just leave him alone all day. So I made sure to check on him every so often and play with him on my lunch break. I did mention I was doing this and she didn't seem to mind. She even asked if I could feed it and look after it when she went away for a few weeks.

But the fact is, 9 months down the line, the cat has become very attached to me, and since I'm the only one home all day, it's always coming to me for affection, bringing me toys to play with etc. Mostly, I'll just be working at my desk in my bedroom and the cat will be asleep on my bed or sometimes it will try and sit on my lap. My bedroom door is on a rolling latch, so even it I shut it out, the cat can always push it open.

But lately, this has caused some issues with my roommate because at night she will take him up to her bedroom but she'll end up kicking him out after a few hours because he'll probably be disturbing her sleep or something (which is fair). But then the cat will come down to my room, push my door open and sleep with me. Now I don't have a problem with this but she's been getting a bit funny about it and she's now asking me to put a barricade against my door every night. But I'm not thrilled about that idea. I don't want to have to block my door off each night just because she feels upset the cat wants to sleep with me. If she was that bothered she wouldn't kick him out or she'd lock him downstairs.

So we're now having arguments about it, and it's causing tension in the home. If ever we're both sat in the lounge and the cat comes over to sit with me, I can feel her getting annoyed. So I'm just wondering if I should have been taking a more active role to ignore the cat and make sure it knows I'm not his owner? Or do think she's just being sensitive?

tl;dr -- *Since I'm home a lot more than my roommate, her cat has taken to me better and now she's asking if I can block off my room in order to keep the cat out but I think this is taking things too far. Who is in the right?*"
"(32m) Husband is mad at me (29f) for what I wear when I go out, he's never been like this before


Little bit of background: we've been married for 6 years with a 4 year old son. Nothing really rocky happened between us except a few minor ""flirting"" incidents with him during my pregnancy but we've turned that page over long ago. 

Basically, a week ago, we got into an argument about what I wear when I go out with friends without him around. I've been basically the same style always and he's suddenly having issues with how I dress, saying how my blouse is too see through and how my skirts too short. Firstly, I don't think that's an issue and second of all I've always dressed like this so why would he get peeved about it now? I asked him all those questions and he just avoids them and tells me not to dress like that in public. I don't think I'm dressed provocatively at all and it's more weird that he's suddenly noticing this after all the years I've been like this?

What's more, just yesterday, I saw him snooping through my underwear drawer, and again he's pointing things out like why are you wearing such slutty thongs, pointing out my g strings and lingerie. I don't get why he's becoming so paranoid all of a sudden?? Because of this we haven't had sex in the past a week and a half, even when I try to reconcile with him he seems to have something on his mind. Can I get some advice on this?

TL;DR - Husband suddenly got angry about how I dress and how I dress to slutty or provocative even though that's how I always dressed. Is there something going on with him? Can I get some advice or thoughts?"
"My (20m) sister (22f) is furious at me for “not protecting” her in a physical fight that she started


A few weeks back, my sister found out that her then-boyfriend was cheating on her. The other girl (19f) is a part of our social group, so she was well aware of what was going on. This really messed up my sister and she became really bitter, angry and frustrated about the whole thing. On several occasions, she told me that she wanted to physically beat up the other girl. I was fiercely against this for 2 reasons. First, the principle of it is just stupid and there’s nothing to be gained for anyone involved - if two scumbags want to cheat on someone, then they’re welcome to have each other IMO. Second, I’m well aware that my sister is skinny, unfit and has never been in a fight in her life, nor does she have any idea how to fight. The other girl is basically the opposite and is actually really athletic. I told her that this was a terrible idea, in no uncertain terms. She just wouldn’t listen to reason - she kept rationalizing that she could easily intimidate/hurt the other girl because she’s a few inches shorter and is “just an 18 year old twit”.

Anyway, a few days back we were going to a BBQ, and the other girl was going to be there. Again, my sister started talking about confronting and fighting her. Again, I told her to please just forget about it and not do anything stupid. At a certain point in the evening, she did exactly what she said she was going to do. She walked up to the other girl and started yelling at her, swearing at her and physically pushing her. At which point the other girl punched my sister in her stomach (she crumpled up like a wet tissue) and started her dragging across the ground by her hair, while kicking in her face and body. Several of us got in the middle of them and pulled them apart. This was all in just a few seconds. My sister was now sitting on the ground, bleeding and crying. I picked her up, half carried her to the car and got the heck out of there. I had to stop just down the road, because she needed to puke (some more great decision making, she decided to start the fight straight after she had finished eating).

This is where things got really confusing for me. My sister cried the whole way home, while yelling at me for “doing nothing” to protect her. She screamed that I “don’t give a f***”  about her and that I didn’t care that she was getting hurt. This was 3 days ago and she’s basically holed herself up in her bedroom. I’m pretty sure she’s been crying constantly, based on the few times I saw her. She refuses to even look in my direction and snaps at me if I try to get her to talk. She hasn’t eaten a thing since this happened, as far I can tell, and I’m actually really worried about her. 

I just don’t understand what I’ve done wrong here, and why she’s refusing to talk to me. I understand that she’s had a rough few weeks and I don’t expect her to be perfectly fine after being cheated on. But starting that fight is a decision that she made as a grown adult, right? Am I missing something here? I honestly love my sister to bits and I consider her my closest and best friend in the world. I just want us to be on speaking terms again, especially so that I can be there for her after all that she’s been through.

TL;DR my sister started a fight, lost, and is mad at me for “not protecting” her."
"I (29 F) almost broke up today with my boyfriend (27 M) of 5 years over house chores.


I (29 F) almost broke up today with my boyfriend (27 M) of 5 years over house chores. I’m fed up with doing everything, cleaning and thinking and planning, while trying to have a successful career, grow as a person and have a wonderful relationship. I love my boyfriend and he tells me that he loves me too, and I can feel in my heart that he does. But... he doesn’t respect me, my work, we had incredible long fights about cleaning and he always apologize and promise me that he will do better. We divided the chores, I let him choose what spaces he wants to be in charge of. I did lists and calendars and I tried to encourage him as much as I could. We are one month later and he didn’t do anything. I feel like a clown. He just ignore the situation until I will work for both of us. The bathroom is filthy, I cleaned it 2 weeks ago (even if it’s he’s responsibility) because his parents where paying us a visit and he didn’t bothered to clean it. I tell myself that people are searching for love and our story is beautiful, but I cannot help not to be in tears over how disrespectful he is to me. He expects me to push and push and push forward without doubting him or our relationship, but I cannot help but wonder if I should exit this thing and search for love, intimacy and respect in other persons. It’s important for me to feel happy in my own clean home. I kicked him out of our bedroom and right now he’s cleaning, but it feels like a show.  Is house chores a thing that can break two in love people or is this just a sign that we are maybe not in love anymore?   

TL; DR! My boyfriend doesn’t do any house work even if he promised me that he will help me and we fought over this countless times. I think about breaking up with him even if I love him."
"My doctor recommended my fiancé (36M) and I (26F) and I not have sex for five months.


Kind of embarrassing as I don’t post this kind of stuff but here goes. I need advice! 
So my fiancé and I are having a baby in January. I just got news from the doctor that I won’t be able to have sex or even orgasm until the baby is born. 5 months. Ugh. 
Sex has been such an amazing way to share our emotions and connect and now we won’t be able to do that. He really only gets turned on when I am being pleased... and that’s obviously not going to happen anymore. So besides the obvious (oral, handies, lol) what kinds of things might you suggest to feel close to one another (doesn’t have to be sexual???) and keep the fire alive? Thanks to everyone who reads!!

TL;DR I need advice on how to connect with my fiancé either sexually or emotionally without sex."
"My (19F) parents (52M, 50F) are asking for money from me and my brother (16M) and pushing us towards lower class.


my mom used to work at a small retail store and while she didnt make a ton it was enough to keep us lower middle class. my dad paints houses and i was unemployed until i almost turned 18 because i couldnt get a car until i almost turned 18. my brother is still unemployed. my mom recently quit her job and started a small business in our neighboring city. very small in a very unsafe area. ive worked there (for free) and ive seen people openly distributing weed in the store, throw full open soda cans inside, come in shitfaced. theres no airconditioning and she gets like 300-500 USD a day. thats not much at all for someone whos taking care of most rent and bills as my dad previously contributed almost nothing. idk where his money used to go.


not long after she started her new business (id been working about a year at this point and done well enough for myself to consider moving out and getting a car like next year) she started asking for rent. about 250 a month. i was a bit upset but i did it no questions. after all, all i did was pay for groceries most times and drive my brother around bc he didnt have his license. i didnt mind all that much.


fast forward three months and shes borrowed about 1000 from just me and i dont have enough to pay for my next semester of college. i have a hold on my account and i wont be able to return to school. my brother has no money in his savings either anymore and my dad has even been contributing. i cant afford to pay my credit card bill as much as id like. i can pay a 20 dollar minimum a month but i always like to do about a hundred. i have to continue to buy groceries and drive people around when i have almost no money for gas.


i forgot to mention for the past month ive been unemployed because my job situation was so poor it was affecting my physical and mental health. i have had no income for a month and im still expected to pay rent. ive just picked up two jobs but havent picked up a check from either and wont for about two weeks. and despite all the help ive provided my mom is still ungrateful.


ive tried to say i dont have enough to give, but ive been guilt tripped everytime. i suppose that makes me a pushover but my dad will pull me aside and tell me my mom is in pain and tired and sad and even considering suicide and she just need 500 for rent this month instead of 250 and dont u love ur family and i cant help it. none of my parents are ever home anymore either and im not either with two jobs and my brother isnt being taken care of anymore, or even keep him company. hes told me he hates being home by himself. i feel terrible, like its my fault. i dont know what to do and i cant bring myself to stop randomly breaking into tears bc i miss having my family home and having a stable financial situation. even if we werent so happy before its definitely worse now.


im tired of my brother walking in on me trying to make dinner while bawling my eyes out. i dont want this anymore and im stuck


tl;dr my mom started a new business that put us in the lower class and is asking all of us for money we dont have all for a job that makes her unhappy"
"My step-daughter (18F) is pregnant, and SD &amp; her mother are calling us terrible because we won't be helping with the baby - how to make this better?


 

I'm very concerned that my SO &amp; I are going to irrevocably ruin our relationships with my SD, and was hoping for some sort of advice regarding our situation.

My SD moved in with us two years ago due to issues she had with her mother, and we gave her two rules at the time: don't lie to us, and don't get pregnant. She has since lied to us repeatedly, but it has been almost non-stop since she got pregnant. While we aren't going to cut her out or anything like that, we also aren't going to coddle her either. She's decided that the father will not be involved in the child's life - for very good reasons - and she is not asking for child support, either. This means that the brunt of helping to raise this child will fall upon the two of us and her mother &amp; stepdad. We informed her after she ultimately decided to keep the baby, that while we'll babysit every once in a while, we are not helping her raise this child. If we wanted a baby, we would have one. She made terrible decisions that led her to this point, and while we love her, we aren't responsible for her bad choices.

Her mother has said that she'll help with the baby, and even offered to raise it on her own, without any input from my SD. Based on the relationship my SD has with her mother, and the fact that they can't be in prolonged contact without a massive fight occurring, we don't foresee her helping in the long-term. After we told my SD our decision to not help with the baby on a daily basis, she stated that we'd never see the baby and that her stepdad would be the only grandfather the baby would ever know. Her mother, upon hearing this from my SD, contacted my SO and told him that this is a terrible thing that we're doing, and asked why he doesn't care about his grandchild. He does care - he just doesn't want to be held accountable for the mess my SD found herself in - especially when she wants to continue working three jobs and enroll in school after the baby is born, meaning that someone would need to be taking care of the baby for her, nearly non-stop.

At this point, I'm extremely torn. One the one hand, my SD is a teenager and needs help. We've been helping her out financially and emotionally since she found out, but should we do more once the baby is born? I've told her that she has my emotional support, but that I won't be helping to raise this baby for her as she goes and lives her life as though she's a part-time mom. I'm fairly certain that this will drive a wedge through our relationship, and that there will be no turning back from this.

Has anyone here experienced anything similar, or has any advice on how to not ruin our relationships with my SD?

&amp;#x200B;

tl;dr We don't want to raise my SD's baby"
"My aunt told her 7yo daughter to watch what she eats


My family has a general issue with being overweight. I wasn’t raised in a manner that taught me healthy eating and exercise habits, and I’m constantly trying to unlearn the unhealthy habits I’ve developed because of that.  

I noticed over Christmas that my cousin had put on a little weight, but nothing to concerning at the time. I also noticed that my family was not encouraging good habits with her—for example, my uncle brought her to my house having just fed her an adult size meal from a fast food place, and she was immediately offered a sandwich by my mother regardless. On Christmas Day, I noticed she ate 1.5 adult size plates of food and her mom made no attempt to put fruit or veggies on her plate (it was completely red meats, mashed potatoes, and crescent rolls). Just last night, I had to fight my mom to give her water with her dinner instead of juice and she was only convinced because I pointed out she hadn’t had a single glass of water all day. 

Over the summer, her athletic activities ended and when I came back from my out-of-state summer job I noticed that she had easily gained ten pounds. Ive always worked to instill body positivity with her, and I’ve been continuing to do it for the last two days that I was watching her. I talked with her about how important it is to drink water with every meal and how it makes your body happy, and how eating veggies and fruit makes your body strong and helps you play longer—and it helped! She asked for carrots with every meal and her mom texted me to say she insisted on drinking water with her dinner tonight to make me happy. 

When my aunt came over to pick her up, though, she said something that made me really upset. My cousin saw a scale that I had in the living room, stepped on it, and read out a number in the 80s. Her mom immediately said “Jesus girl! That’s ten pounds in two months. You need to stop eating so much crap”. As if she isn’t DIRECTLY responsible for her nutrition. For Christ’s sake, she dropped her off at my house with four yogurt packets, an unopened goldfish package, a bag of chocolate covered pretzels, and two lunchables knowing full well that I have food at my house to feed her with. She even asked beforehand if i needed her to bring food over and I said no?

I just don’t know how to approach this subject with my family at all? It feels out of my lane to tell my aunt to get it together, and even if I do tell her all my other family members have been encouraging poor eating habits to her too. I’m watching her for another 24 hours next week and it’s gonna come up again. 

TLDR: my cousin gained weight because my family has poor eating habits and her mother said something confidence-shattering to her child"
"Is not buying a house worth divorcing over?


M (38) married to wife (36) for 4 years. Been living in a rental property in a secure tenancy for 3 years.
Wife decided she was unhappy in house and due to all the unhappy memories she wanted to move out. (We have had fertility issues and several failed rounds of IVF)
Wife doesn’t contribute to household bills as she works part time in temporary contract as she has been trying to launch own company.
I’ve supported her physically, emotionally and financially with this where I can and agreed I will pay for everything so she can chase her dream.
I have a secure job and decent salary so more than happy to support her.
We have a joint credit card debt and agreement was she would pay this whilst I pay everything else.
It’s also fair to say I do all the cooking and cleaning in the house, but since I work from home, I don’t mind doing so.
Suddenly one day she decided she didn’t want to live in this house anymore due to the sadness of fertility issues, so she just upped and left.
She didn’t even speak to me for the first two weeks and she’s ignored all my messages.
She has also had mental health issues in the past so this sort of flighty behaviour isn’t new when things get tough.
But two months on she still doesn’t want to come back, and has said she doesn’t want to rent anymore and wants to buy.
I’m not comfortable buying as the mortgage would only be on my salary only so wouldn’t be able to afford as nice a house as we currently rent, and with recent flight from her, even more dubious.
She also wants to live in town closer to her folks, which I don’t.
So this is her line in the sand and has said that’s pretty much it for us unless I buy.

TL;DR
Should I just get over myself and buy us a house or is this unreasonable behaviour?"
"I (31m) am quickly growing tired of my relationship with my girlfriend (33f), just like all my previous relationships. What is this pattern? Is this common? Can anything be done?


I've come to realize that every one of my longer-lasting romantic relationships ends the same way, and I'm at the point where I'm frustrated with myself, aimless, and, to be quite frank, feeling a little scared about my romantic future if this continues.

I've been dating my girlfriend for about a year and a half now, and generally, things have gone well. We get along smoothly and haven't had any major issues throughout our relationship. We moved in together after about a year of dating, and the living situation has also been largely issue-free and enjoyable.

Over the past few months, I've been feeling myself re-enter a phase I've hit in virtually all of my previous relationships - that is, a general feeling of disinterest and restlessness that leads to a lack of romance, sexual interest, and (historically, anyway) the eventual dissolution of a relationship. I've been through this pattern probably five times in my adult life, all with women I'd dated for approximately a year or so, before ending things and moving on.

I don't know exactly what causes this; I believe it differs with each relationship. With my current SO, I'm inclined to believe it's a combination of a few factors, namely a lack of sexual attraction (while she's a beautiful woman, I don't find myself particularly sexually drawn to her) as well as a lack of connection on a few key personality traits (our senses of humor aren't 100% aligned; also, I find that I'm significantly more motivated and driven than she is, which has begun to bother me rather deeply).

More than anything, I start to feel that a relationship is becoming more of an obligation and burden than a worthwhile, rewarding endeavor. I weigh the relationship against the other things I'd like to be doing with my time (career goals, artistic goals, social pursuits), and I gradually begin to feel like I'm spending my time doing something I'd rather not be doing.

I know about the ebbs and flows of a relationship; how things aren't always going to be enthralling and new and fresh. I know that a major component of a long-lasting, successful relationship is stability/commitment. I'm primarily worried that I will never value a relationship (and its tidings) more than my own autonomy, goals, pursuits, and priorities.

I've been fortunate to date wonderful women - they are certainly all worthy of someone's time, energy, and commitment. I've been in therapy on and off for a few years, though admittedly this specific topic isn't something we've broached yet. I was hoping that age, time, and relationship experience would eventually render this feeling/pattern obsolete, but I'm beginning to think this might be a lifelong affliction.

I guess I'd like to hear from those of you who have found yourself in similar situations and how they ended up for you. Did you eventually settle into a lasting relationship? Why or why not? Are you happy with the direction you've moved in? Did you discover the root cause(s) for you feeling similar to the way I feel?

**TLDR** \- Had a handful of serious, long-term relationships as an adult - all of them have ended after a similar pattern of disinterest and restlessness. Current relationship is beginning to move in this same direction as well. Curious to hear anecdotes from others sharing similar experiences, how they dealt with them, and if they have any insight to offer."
"Girlfriend pregnant, everyone pressuring me to get married!!!


Just found out I [24] got my girlfriend [23] pregnant. Luckily I graduated college recently and have a decent job and she has about a year to finish up. Bad timing but I love her more than anything and always planned on marrying/having a kid together so we are rolling with it.

That being said, now that we have found out my family, gfs family, and gf are all pressuring me super hard to get married. Like every hour I’m getting told who I can and can’t have as my groomsmen or that we NEED to get married during fall or winter break before the baby comes.

Maybe it’s my anxiety or something but I feel like all this pressure and rush is impulsive. My main focus is things like getting our vehicles serviced and maintained so we get enough life out of them and looking for high paying jobs to prepare for the baby and everyone is so focused on this superficial nonsense. I feel like it won’t even be special because everyone is hammering down my throat when and where we are getting married before I have even proposed.

TLDR: got my girlfriend pregnant and I’m extremely excited but everyone in my family and her and her family are pressuring me to get married asap. Am I wrong for wanting to take a step back and focus on preparing for the baby? They are planning it as if I have already proposed and it makes me feel weird. Would really appreciate the advice, thanks."
"I (17M) overheard my dad call me a ""fucking loser"" and its hard for me to love him


Ok so im gonna try and keep this short cause it has really hurt me.  I am 17 only child and my parents usually talk about their day in the garage I heard them screaming in the garage and during the screaming I hear ""I find it hard to love (my name) cause he's a fucking loser"" I was beyond hurt when I heard that cause everything I did was for him to be proud of me.  I hate playing football but I have played it all 4 years cause HE likes football, I learned how to drive at an early drive and got into cars cause HE likes cars and got a job so HE would be happy I'm being responsible.  It was super shell shocking to hear him say that, only reasoning I can think of is cause I am a bit of an introvert and haven't had really dated anyone yet.  

The more I think about it the more it hurts me.  My parents were very neglectful towards me growing up and didn't let me leave the house to hang out with my friends AT ALL either cause their words ""you got to look after the house while we work.""  So while they were at work I wasn't allowed to leave the house and all I could do was watch TV.  Everything I have ever done was to please them and make them proud of me and now I realize that its all pointless.  I have no idea what to do anymore I have one more year of school before I can finally move out and after this.......I plan on moving out as SOON as I graduate.  

TL;DR:My dad called me a ""fucking loser"" and finds it hard to love me cause I'm an introvert and never dated anyone."
"Would I be unreasonable to ask my roommate if her girlfriend could spend less time at our apartment? (F18-21)


Hello, I'm on mobile so I cant put a non romantic flair. I put it in relationships because I need advice tackling the situation and making sure she doesn't completely hate me after.

I'm in a foster care program for kids who are aging out. Basically we get our rent payed in full for an apartment and all utilities taken care of except PGE &amp; internet. I was able to move in two weeks before my roommate did, and they told us nothing about each other before we moved in. She just moved in randomly and I wasnt notified until an hour beforehand. I should say that the program has very strict rules you have to follow and if you get three strikes, you're out basically.

The problem I'm facing is her girlfriend. The roommate for the most part is nice and OK. Her Gf however, despises anything to do with me. It's not like i try to hang out with them or anything if any I only see them for 20 minutes of a certain day. Here are some examples of her behavior towards me. 

- Everytime I try to talk to the roommate, her GF grabs her arm and pulls her to the room, where she slams the door and basically they just stay there all night. So now we have to either talk through the white board in the kitchen or text, but my roommate never responds to me anyway. This makes it super hard for us to talk about house stuff.

- This GF takes hour long showers in our apartment and they use HUGE amounts of toilet paper and wipes. No joke, I was gone for the weekend and beforehand I bought us 6 packs of wipes from Amazon. When I got back there was two left and I had to replace a 24 roll pack of toilet paper. Wtf do they even need that many for?!?!

- If using things weren't bad enough, the GF leaves her hair in the shower for me to pick up (I know its hers because she has different colored hair than the rest of us, she dyes it bright pink lol) and leaves water all over the floor

- The GF insists on playing her Switch at full volume, 1-3 in the morning mind you, even though the roommate tries to tell her to turn it down for my sake, she doesn't do it

- I can hardly have my BF over, my roommate says her Gf is uncomfortable around men, even though he only spends time in my room. I've only had him twice in the house since she moved in two months ago, we dont have sex here we stay quiet and he doesnt eat any of the food in the fridge. Because of this he is starting to resent my roommate which I understand. 

Meanwhile, I hear them have sex in the room next door (and before y'all say anything, NO, it is not hot) and making out.

She stays over every night, my roommate finds any excuse to keep her in, even though our agreement said she can only have her GF stay one night a week, I'm not sure how I can keep proof of these in order for the program to take action. 

I got called a bigot from one of my now ex friends saying it's because I internally marginalize against lesbians, which wtf, that's bullshit if I've ever heard it. This has nothing to do with gender but all to do with her shitty behavior. 

How can i bring this up without sounding like a horrible demanding person?

Tl;dr: Roommate's GF is making my living situation miserable."
"My (32f) kids step mom (29f) is emotionally unstable. How to proceed?


So my children go to their dads house one day a week. They are 15&amp;11, the 11 y/o is on the spectrum.  My ex has been dating a woman for the past 2 years and yesterday was the last straw on how she treats my kids. She jokes that she is bipolar, but idk if she actually is and she definitely isn’t being treated if she actually is. 

So sometimes she great. She’s happy, fun, and generally fine to be around. 

But mostly she is not. She is moody, snappy, passive aggressive, sarcastic, and just generally unpleasant. 

Some examples of her behaviors:

We were at an awards show for my oldest daughter. After the show we were standing around and my youngest daughter was crinkling an empty water bottle. My wife (I’m gay) and I were talking to the girlfriend and she snaps around and yells at my daughter to stop crinkling the bottle. 😳 

Yesterday my youngest was talking to her about wanting to save her money for a tablet. The gf told her that it would be too hard and she should try. 

If one my kids asks her to spell a word she was sat “you’re 15 you should know how to spell that” 

She makes comments about how my youngest has special needs and it’s “a lot for her to handle emotionally” 

She is constantly fighting with their dad in front of them. One time they got into a fight so big she slammed the door so hard she knocked the number off the door. They fight about everything. Literally she takes offense to everything. If she’s using a measuring cup and he suggests to use a different size, she freaks out and will say “oh I guess I’m just a fucking idiot that doesn’t know how to cook” and storm out of the kitchen. 

Like this woman is a walking land mine. 

Yesterday it came to a head and I had to come pick my kids up because the oldest called me crying because the gf has made some pretty insensitive comments and then added insult to injury by saying how hard it was for her since the youngest has special needs. 

My wife and I are pretty much at our limit. This happens literally every time they come home. One of them is upset and it’s usually my daughter that is autistic. We have witnessed first hand the gfs outbursts, tantrums, tones, snappy comment etc. sometimes when she has a really big outburst she will apologize, which is what she tried to do yesterday, but the behavior doesn’t change. My youngest doesn’t want to see her anymore and my wife and I don’t really want her around our kids. 

So basically I’m asking how would your proceed here? My wife and I are supposed to talk to her and my ex today about everything that happened yesterday and we need a plan moving forward. 

I want to say that she’s not allowed around my kids until she’s in therapy and working towards changing her behavior, but I know you can’t make people change. 

TDLR; my ex’s girlfriend is emotional unstable. She yells, snaps, is passive aggressive, combative etc. the behavior has peaked and my kids no longer want to see her. Unsure how to approach that conversation with her as she is prone to outbursts."
"BF (21M) freaked out at me over getting my (22F) tattoo, how do I go about this?


I hope the title isn't misleading, I've really no other way to put it. Sorry for formatting as I'm on mobile! This is LONG so sorry, tldr at the bottom.

So, I need to put some details in here before getting down to the nitty gritty. 

This tattoo appointment was made a day prior, VERY short notice. *BUT* I've been following this artist and their work for a very long time now. I also have friends that have gotten work done by them. It is a *very* reputable and clean shop, and everyone working there has been in the business for years. 

Now, as I said above I love this artists work. So I gave them some things I liked and pretty much told them to go wild. I had much more confidence in them making something beautiful than I did myself to piece together something I *thought* I might like. I asked the artist for a time/price guesstimate, and they said it would be probably a palm sized tattoo and the appointment would be about 4 - 5 hours. Okay! I tell (let's call him Max) and he has 0 quarrels. 

The next day comes and I show up to the appointment. *(I have MASSIVELY bad social anxiety, and it's really hard for me to do things alone so this was a major accomplishment for me already)* 

Everything goes so smoothly. The artist is an absolute sweetheart, and they show me a few different designs to pick from. (Frankly they were all freaking stunning) and we get everything situated. Now as we're checking out the design, they print a bigger one (maybe double the size of the original) and both of us decide to go with the bigger size as it looks better. 

SO, the appointment starts. I got there at 1pm, and we started the actual tattoo at like 2ish. I'm talking to Max the entire time. Sending pictures of progress, etc etc. Around 6 my phone is about to die and I make sure to update *everyone* that I'll message when I'm out. Now, Max has been anxious the entire time I'm out. Anytime I go out alone he just assumes something terrible is going to happen to me (?) 

Anyway, to reestablish- 
•I told Max that the tattoo was double the size of the original (I would think that would imply twice as long of an appointment)
•I've been sending progress pictures for hours. (At that point we had just finished the outline and colored in some minor things) 
•I told him I had a car charger and would message when I got out 

The actual tattoo shop closed at 8pm, but I think most (if not all) businesses won't kick someone out at closing if they're in the middle of something. Anyway, I ended up getting out a little later than 10. 

I get in my car and charge my phone, and immediately I'm bombarded with messages. Even after saying my phone died, he messaged me every half hour saying he was nervous. When 8pm hit he freaked out because ""on the website it says they close at 8"" he called his brother freaking out saying he was going to drive to the shop if I didn't answer at 11. All of this insane stuff. I immediately message him and he calls me yelling at me. ""What the fuck?"" Stuttering and stammering, word vomiting over the phone. So I tell him ""I need to listen to my GPS to get home we can talk about this in a few"" and hang up (I just got a massive tattoo in one sitting, I am fucking exhausted) 

Now, as I'm driving he messages me FIFTY times, no exaggeration. Inbetween saying ""you can't be mad at me"" and calling me inconsiderate saying I could have charged my phone, I just chose not to. I get home and explain ""so you expected me to get up, mid appointment, to go outside across the parking lot with an open tattoo to crawl in my car to sit and charge my phone??? We didn't take a single break the entire appointment??""

And this escalates into a fight where he gets in his car and leaves. After a 9 hour tattoo appointment, I was hoping for maybe SOME reassurance or ""do you need anything?"" not screaming and yelling. 

I do understand why he was worried, but to absolutely have a meltdown over it is over the top imo? Neither the artist or I had an exact finish time, but I gave him so much info to work with. Sizing, coloring, hourly updates, you name it. It was extremely unrealistic to expect me to stop the appointment to sit in my car to charge my phone while getting worked on. (Frankly, as a 22yr old that would've been embarrassing to explain as well) if he didn't freak out, I maybe would have just apologized and called it a night. And the website had a number posted to call as well. Why not call the office if you're THAT worried? So many things that I just don't understand really. I have no idea what to do with this situation and he won't back down. 

I want to be understanding but I just can't get over his reaction. I used to struggle with self harm/suicidal tendencies and I've gotten tattoos before and the two prior ones made me extremely anxious because it was a similar feeling. He was aware of this. It was such a big step for me and I really feel as though he ruined the night for me. I wanted to be able to look back on it like it was an accomplishment and now it's another thing to be sad about. 

TLDR; I went to a tattoo appointment and my appointment went longer than expected. I gave my bf a lot of information to work with regarding times and my phone died after I clarified it would. He had an absolute meltdown because the appointment went two hours past closing. It's been a fight for almost a week now and I feel like he over reacted and is blowing the situation up."
"Is what my [29F] boyfriend [30M] said creepy or am I overblowing it? [NSFW]


My boyfriend of 4 years and I were discussing a dress of mine earlier when he interjected with ""I wish I could've experienced you in high school,"" to which I replied ""Why?"" He then responded with ""Because I would've liked to experience your fresh breasts."" I asked ""If they were fresh what are they now?"" He said ""Still fresh."" I told him that was weird and asked if he lusted after high school girls. He said no. Then I got upset and he got annoyed. 

Am I overreacting? 

TLDR: Boyfriend said he would've liked to experience my ""fresh"" high school breasts. I'm nearing 30 and he is 30. Is this weird?"
"My [18F] boyfriend [20M] of 2 years accidentally mooned my mom


Everyone at my house was leaving to go somewhere and my boyfriend thought that it was just me and him left in the house, so being the ""jokester"" that he is, he pulls his pants down and moons, little did he know, my mom was behind me. I was actually looking at her when he pulled his pants down and I saw her face in total shock at seeing my boyfriend's bare ass (asshole and everything). No words came out of her mouth and my boyfriend, embarrassed, said sorry and ran out of the house like a mofo. I know I'll have to talk with my mom tonight, idk what questions would come out of her mouth....she's suspicious that I already lost my virginity, but she's hella religious and that's a no no. what excuse do I give her that wouldn't lead her to going that direction in the conversation, bc I feel like she might think this since my face wasn't too shocked when I saw it.

TL;DR my boyfriend mooned my mom, and i didn't know she was behind me, I wasn't shocked, and idk how to talk to her"
"Husband [38M] deleting texts from younger female colleague [26F]


So husband and I work together and he has a younger colleague who has a bit of a crush on him. She has told him she fancies him (when drunk) and he has never reciprocated anything. She was embarrassed after admitting it to him. I have since found out she has sent him flirty messages which he deleted so I didn’t find out. Apparently he never replied to anything she sent. Have found this out through another friend at work who thought I knew about the messages. Have asked my husband who says he deleted it all as he knew it would upset me and there was no need as he just deleted it straight away and never replied to her. What do you make of this?

TL;DR husband has been deleting texts from co worker and didn’t tell me about them"
"I (29F) cut off my friends for the sake of my marriage (30M) but now I'm miserable


So, where to start. Years ago I envisioned myself an artsy type. Attending readings, discussing literature, living in a big city and wearing turtlenecks, that kind of thing. I even lived in NYC for a time which was amazing. But instead I chose a different life. I work at a hospital and wear dumpy scrubs, I moved out to the suburbs, had a child (3M) with my husband (10 years together), basically settled down. As you do. 

When we moved to the suburbs on the other side of the country it took me many miserable years to find friends, but 2 years ago I found them. They're a small group in my age range, we discuss writing and reading, we meet weekly. Some of them even lived in NYC which I sorely missed. It's been amazing and it's made me tolerate the suburbs and just be happy overall. 

Six months ago, a man named Matt joined the group. And over time I developed strong feelings for him. I could talk to him about my literary aspirations, and he had similar dreams. We never met alone, always in the group, but I knew this wasn't good for me and my marriage. I was comparing my husband to him and that's not healthy.

Three months ago i told the group I needed a break, so I left. And I've been miserable. I have tried and tried to find replacement friends and it just hasn't happened. I keep missing my old friends. I started getting upset about other things. I've tried to spend more time with my husband, go on dates, etc but sometimes I come home to him and see him watching anime or something and I just feel defeated. Nothing wrong with anime but it just...he's so different from me. I'm still comparing him to Matt even though we have no contact. 

I love my husband. He's my partner, the father of my child, and an amazing person. But I'm not happy anymore. I keep missing the life I used to have. I feel further and further away and I feel myself getting older. 30 is approaching and it's gonna suck. 

I'm on a waiting list for therapy through work. But I want to work on things in the meantime. Anyone have any advice for me and my family? I am not considering leaving. Marriage is the ultimate commitment. I built a life with my husband, even if it wasn't the life I envisioned. I want to fix this.

**Tl;Dr developed feelings for a friend, cut him and other friends off, now lonely and sad**"
"My boyfriend uses Instagram ONLY to look at other girls. Am I over reacting?


It's a long one, sorry guys!

My boyfriend (26) and I (F, 28) have been together for three and a half years and are currently living together.

So I don’t use Instagram, cause I’m old, and I just don’t feel the need for it. Over a year ago, it was brought to my attention by my sister (who is friends with my bf) that he had an Instagram account. No biggy. She then proceeded to tell/show me that EVERY single person he follows is a girl, and you can guess what kind of posts they might be. My sister did actually speak to him and say like, hey I think that’s a bit dodgy/creepy but he didn’t see the problem and carried on using it. 

I mulled it over for ages and I finally said something to him about it, just that I found it disrespectful and a bit hurtful that he feels the need to have a whole social media account just for looking at girls. His excuse is that it’s just something to scroll through when he’s bored, and that he doesn’t see the problem with it. A lot of the time when he comes home from work, he just wants to play video games (which again I’m fine with) but then it’s like he is spending all day looking at other girls and paying no attention to me when he gets home, which feels sort of crappy to me.

The outcome of this conversation was that he deleted/uninstalled it. 

I don’t want to sound like a crazy girlfriend, like I don’t stop him watching porn or hanging out with girls etc, this just feels really personal. I don’t check up on him or his phone, he can do pretty much what he wants, have sex whenever he wants. If he just used Instagram in a ‘normal’ way then I would not care, if it was girls and other stuff as well, I would not care, but only girls just feels seedy and uncomfortable to me. 

Then he got it back again, three times. On the second time, I only found out because I noticed him hiding his phone from me and questioned it. Then the most recent time, my sister actually messaged me about it. He purposely tried to hide it from me each time, knowing it would upset me. My question is, why would you carry on doing something if you know it’s going to upset someone?  On the third occasion I told him that I wouldn’t take anymore lying and that if he hid stuff from me again then we’re done. And now it’s happened again.

I am at my wits end with it. He doesn’t understand at all why I find it upsetting, but I feel like if your partner finds something upsetting then you don’t necessarily need to understand it, but just understand that it hurts them. I don’t feel like it’s an outrageous thing to be upset about, like I’m sure it wouldn’t bother everyone but it does bother me and I feel he should respect that. The issue is more now about the fact that he does it willingly without caring about my feelings, more than the actual act itself being hurtful now. 

I don’t feel like I can trust him anymore. If he lies and hides this from me then what else could he be lying and hiding from me? I feel like he is really disrespecting me by purposely hurting me like this and I’m seriously questioning our relationship.  

TL;DR - boyfriend uses instagram for creeping, lies and hides using it, doesn't understand the upset and has happened four times now. 

Am I over reacting or am I justified in how I feel?!"
"Update: I (26F) made a friend on (30F) on a friendship app. She is very needy and I don't what to do now.


&amp;#x200B;

[Original post is here](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/c7juii/i_26f_made_a_friend_30f_on_a_friendship_app_she/)

TL;DR: A needy friend blew up at me because I didn't WhatsApp her for a week.

I took the advice of Redditors and I spoke to this girl, letting her know that I'm not in a position to reply to her x times a week or to be making regular plans to meet up. I'm going through a lot and I don't always feel like being on my phone, or meeting up, etc.

She seemed surprisingly understanding, and asked if we could still talk/ be friends. That I can respond to her messages when I want to, and that maybe in a months time I'll feel better and be ready to meet up with her (\*rolls eyes\*).

So fine, if you really want to keep talking then of course. Time goes on. She messages me every day, I reply within a couple of days. She keeps trying to make birthday plans - plans that involve me driving hours with her for a day out - but I don't commit.

Honestly, I haven't felt like putting in the effort over the last week. I've been busy and tired, and I haven't responded to her last message. Here's what she sent me today:

&gt;I thought we were going to still talk, not talking for over a week is not us still talking!   
I have been very understanding concidering we have only met once and you cancelled on me twice!  
Needing time as I know you are going through a hard time is one thing but completely not being a friend to me when you are going through a difficult time is something totally different!  
If 1. I don't see you around the time our birthday's 2. if you after my birthday you are going to keep going quiet 3. You are not going to talk to me before my  birthday at least a couple of times a week, then I will realise that we aren't going to move forward or be friends.

I blocked her. This doesn't make me feel good, but I don't have the energy."
"I (34 F) am going to leave my husband (35m)


TLDR: I'm leaving. And it's because of housework. 

The reason I am leaving you is because I am happier and better on my own. When I am living in XYZ, I love my life. When I am here living with you I feel like a maid. Every day after you leave I spend 30 minutes running around and wiping up your literal shit. You leave whiskers and coffee cups and unflushed toilets everywhere. You cannot even put your motherfucking clothes in the motherfucking basket. What’s more, I’m afraid to even talk about this with you. When I do, you act like I’m insulting you. Well, maybe I am. I have asked you SO MANY TIMES. Please just put your laundry in the laundry bin. Please just put your mug in the dishwasher. Please just wipe down the sink when you shave. And you can't or won't do this. So when you leave, I run around like a maniac tidying up after you. And you treat me like I'm super OCD or something.

When I had to move away for work, the incredible thing was that my life got sooooo much easier. I only had to look after myself, and it turns out that I’m not high maintenance. You talked about how difficult it was to be on your own; how you had so much to look after and so many chores and errands to do. No shit. It’s because I literally did every fucking thing for you. I changed your sheets and scrubbed your toilet and made every meal. I’ve been so sick with the flu these last few days. And you did absolutely nothing for me. But I still crawled out of bed and went and got food for you because I was too sick to cook. Did it even, possibly, occur to you that it might be nice if you could heat up a can of soup for me? Holy fucking Jesus, that would be the most you have done for me in our married life.

When I’m here I’m a maid. I’d rather be on my own. When was the last time you made me a meal? Or did any kind of household chore? It’s been 15 years of thinking what YOU want for dinner and what YOU could take for lunch tomorrow. In our entire life have you ever, ever packed me a lunch? Or even thought about my lunch? Or even paid attention to what I might need for lunch? Or even realized that I’m a human being who might need to eat lunch?

The most hurtful thing you said to me was when we were arguing about housework several years ago. You said, “Well, I would never get this emotional about dishes.” Oh really, motherfucker? Let’s see you do them all, all the time. Then you might get emotional about them.

I don’t want to be married anymore. Maybe I’m a shithole of a wife. If that is the case, then you are better off without me.

And one more thing. For the last several years when my birthday comes around you have not only forgotten but you didn’t even acknowledge it. Like, you got you up in the morning and went to work and did not even say a thing. Then later when I brought it up you said, “Oh, I knew it was your birthday. I didn't forget.” Well if you knew then it’s even worse. I have friends at work who are nicer to me on my birthday. Last year my roommate threw me a surprise party. Six people got together and gave me the most lovely party. And yet you cannot work up the care even to say, “Happy birthday.”

I’ll take half the credit card debt. It should be paid off by the end of the year. Not sure what to do about the cats."
"Me [26 F] with stranger [40+M] won't leave me alone on bus and is creeping me out.


A few weeks ago as I was walking the less than 1 minute from my bus stop to my home a voice from behind said ""is your leg better now?"" I turned to see a man I'd never seen before. Not wanting to go into details about my disability and why I sometimes use a walking stick or not, I just said ""it comes and goes"" and walked ahead to get home. 

Now every single day this guy tries to talk to me. I sit on the bus with headphones visibly in, and in a seat that I can't physically be sat next to. And he still stops and tries to talk to me. 

He gets on the same bus as I do morning (although a different stop) and evening and it's turned from me being a bit awkward and antisocial not wanting to have a conversation. To me now being a bit scared. From observation I've noticed that he doesn't actually live anywhere near my bus stop in the evening, so is only getting off there to follow and talk to me. He also now obviously knows where I live. 

On Friday he asked if I had a boyfriend and I panicked and just walked as fast into my home as possible. 

What do I do in this situation now?

TL;Dr: Creepy guy on bus won't get my very obvious signals I'm not interested (headphones, walking off ahead) and is making me fear getting on my bus. Help!"
"How can I get my husband (25 M) of two years to leave the bachelor life behind for me (25 F) and son (1 M)


My husband and I have been married for 2 years and together for 8 total. We have a one year old that is absolutely perfect. I have just been feeling like he is not loving the life of a family man. All of his friends are bachelors and it has been hard for him to adjust. 

Husband has always been a social guy and loving to go out and have hobbies and party. I thought (and he told me) that this would decrease once we had a family. It doesn’t feel like it has changed at all as he is always trying to hang out with friends and leave the house whenever he can. I am more of a homebody. I love to be social but going to work and hanging out with friends once a week is good enough for me. It makes me sad thinking that he is not satisfied with myself and our son. I just wish he was more present for our baby. I wish he was a family man. 

I always feel like I am just at home doing housework and taking care of the child while he is living his life. And by the time my husband is home and he says, “you can go out and do something if you want” I am just exhausted from all the work I have done that day being the sole provider for our son. I’m sick of feeling like I am more of a single mom more than I have a partner. It hurts because I want him to have a social life and be happy, I just wish it wasn’t an every day thing. 

I feel as though day after day I am not being chosen. I do not want to live my life in regret knowing that I could have had someone who wanted to actually live life with me. 

And I should add- we have had this discussion many times. His reasoning is always- “Just because I’m a dad doesn’t mean I have to be chained to the house” or “I shouldn’t feel guilty for wanting to golf” (side note he has golfed for a total of 20 hours this week). 

TLDR: how do i get my husband to be more of a family man and let go of the bachelor life? Or do I just grin and bear it to keep the peace in my house?"
"My boyfriend (30M) of two years left me (30F) so he could date other women. I’m not handling it well.


I apologise for how long this is.

My boyfriend has been wonderful, I met him and changed my life plans because I fell head over heels for him in a short time.  I am very particular about men I like but there was no aspect about him that I didn’t like. We got along great, had the same sense of humour, same interests, etc. Being with him made me felt complete, like a best friend, but even better. I told him everything about me, more than my friends knew about me. I have a lot of issues with my life (family members with terminal illnesses, tough job, etc); a lot of the time, he would be the only thing I would look forward to. I thought everything was too good to be true. I never asked him about marriage or our future because I didn’t want to scare him with commitment.

I’ve always had low self-esteem and, compounded with the fact that my father cheated on my mother and ruined my life in more ways that I could describe, I started off being insecure. In the beginning of our relationship, I would ask him if he genuinely liked me, if he felt I was pretty enough, etc. He always assured me did and I started to believe him.

Three days ago, he came over to my house for our usual Saturday date. I got into his car and told me he wasn’t sure we were compatible. I was shocked. He listed a lot of things he didn’t like about me (ie I’m negative and didn’t consider how that affected him, I ask him what’s wrong when he just wants some quiet time to himself, and sometimes I get upset and he didn’t like apologising for that). I cried my eyes out and did not talk to him on Saturday or Sunday, except to say goodnight.

By the time Monday came over, I started getting worried about him. I messaged him to see if he was okay, he said he was and I apologised for the grief I had caused him. He replied no, I had been nothing but kind and great to him, but I deserved someone better. (At this point, I was wondering if he wanted to leave me because he felt guilty about hurting me with what he said earlier).

I called him right away and begged him not to give up on us over something so small. He said the truth was, I loved more than he loves me back, that he loved me but was not in love with me. That he couldn’t really see a future with us and again and again, that I deserved someone better. He said he just had a gut feeling, the same feeling that he got at his old job, which prompted a great career change. The phone call ended with me saying I’m letting him go now.

I thought he was just leaving me to protect me, and wasn’t completely honest. I discovered I was right the following day — he said the truth was, his friend got engaged. That made him think about his own future and felt like he needed “at least two long-term relationships” before he could decide. He said I was his only long-term relationship and he couldn’t be 100% sure he wanted to be with me as he did not have anything to compare me to. He started thinking about other women at the start of our second year together and it only grew. 

He said he might have been making the worst decision of his life by breaking up with me, because he knows we might never get back together, but he’s willing to risk it. I told him I was sorry that I wasn’t enough.

He also asked if I would consider taking him back after a few months, when he’s done comparing. I told him right now, the answer is yes, but after that time passes, I wouldn’t be sure.

I cried and cried, but at that point, I had accepted it. I told him I understood, that he thought the grass is greener on the other side, I thought the grass is greener where you water it.

The more I think about it, the more felt like I was used as an experimental “practice run”, not a person. He is my first love, but now I see him as the  “my first love... and the man who threw me away.” My faith in him has been destroyed.

I miss him terribly. I wish this was all a bad dream, that I’d wake up and he’d laugh and reassure me that he loves me, just like he always used to. I’m coming into terms with the fact that the person I’m missing has gone and changed into a different person. But it hurts so unbelievably bad. I haven’t been able to sleep much or eat much at all. I am spontaneously bursting into tears.

My questions:

1. How long does the breakup pain last?

2. How can I speed up the process?

3. Is it normal for someone to think multiple long-term relationships is required before settling down?

4. How will I avoid meeting another man who will be like this I the future??

5. How come I had to be the unlucky one who had to be his “practice run”???

TLDR: My first and only seemingly-perfect boyfriend of two years left me to experience other women and it really shattered my world."
"I [24 F] just found out my boyfriend [25 M] of over a year cheated on me within the first week of becoming official


I’ve always thought we’ve had a perfect relationship. We get along very well, generally good at communication, and just have fun together. We leave for holiday this weekend to his home county to meet his parents for the first time. He texted me yesterday and said he wanted to speak with me before we leave. 

About a week after we had the talk and became exclusive, he slept with another girl. He went over to her house to study and said they got drunk and one thing led to another. They were both very drunk and he said immediately he regretted it. He said he didn’t see our relationship as serious at the time but now he does. Again this was over a year ago and he is just now telling me

I don’t know what to do, I’m so hurt. I honestly saw myself marrying this man but now I don’t know. He does seem very upset with himself and truly regrets it. He said he’s never cheated since and only has eyes for me. I just don’t know if I can believe him. I’m at a loss for words and just don’t know what to do.

TLDR: My boyfriend of over a year just told me he cheated on me within one week of us becoming official. He said he didn’t take the relationship seriously then but now he does. I’m not sure how to go forward."
"How do I (30M) approach isolated neighbor (70M) for friendship?


Hi Reddit. Sorry if this is a dumb question, I'm a social trainwreck and a classic overthinker.

In my apartment building lobby there is almost always an elderly man in a wheelchair just sitting there by himself. I come and go at all hours of the day and night, and more often than not he is sitting there by himself. I have no idea what his story is.

My question is stupid and simple, what is a good way to try to have an extended conversation with him? I say hello to him sometimes, but that's it. The lobby has an assortment of chairs and furniture so I could easily sit with him. My only reservation is that he seems to have nowhere else to go, so if I were to sit and talk to him, he's pretty much stuck with me and can't escape. He may not want friends, he never initiates greetings or further conversations.

I just hate seeing this guy by himself all the time and I'm wondering if he wouldn't mind some company. My current plan is to either bring a bagged lunch by and ask if he minds that I eat with him, or bring a deck of cards on some evening and ask if he wants to play war or some shit.

Does my plan sound reasonable? Or should I leave this guy alone and stick with generic small talk as I come and go?

TLDR: Should I try to strike up a friendship with my potentially lonely neighbor, and if so, how?"
"I[27M] found out that an acquaintance of mine[30M] is a Paedophile.


This is not about a romantic relationship - It's about my relationship with an acquaintance of mine. I live in South Africa.  

I am a drug addict in recovery. A few months ago, one of my fellows in recovery \[let's call him **Mike**\] relapsed and started drinking again. FULL-ON denial - the ""Alcohol is not a drug"" kind. OK. So I tell him that he can contact me any time if he needs advice or if he needs emotional/moral support.  

Skip forward several months, and tonight I spoke to my sponsee, who is a semi-friend of Mike's. My sponsee still sees him at Church sometimes.  

My sponsee drops the biggest bomb-shell I have ever faced in my recovery....  

Before his relapse, Mike had told my sponsee that he finds young children attractive... sexually.  

**He later told my sponsee that he has been abusing 2 of his landlady's children, one 10 and the other 4.**  

    
After hearing this I saw red. Because of my mother's history, if mike had told me this in person I would have probably beat the living shit out of him. 

    
My sponsee went to the police a while back, but they told him that they can only do something if they catch him IN THE ACT.  

  Why am I posting here? because I know that this sub-reddit has a huge amount of visitors, and I fucking need help.  

What would you do?  

  

TL:DR  

An acquaintance of mine is a paedophile and I don't know what to do"
"Boyfriend (27m) doesn’t want to have sex with me (24f)


My boyfriend (27m) and I (24f) haven’t had sex in months. We have been together 2 and a half years and we maybe have sex every 3-4 months. I broke up with him a few months ago because of this reason and we were apart for 1 week, then we got back together because he told me things would change. We had sex the day we got back together and never again since. I told him the other day I don’t understand why he doesn’t want to have sex with me, he told me he’s just not affectionate. I told him I need a lot of “affection” and he told me things would change (again). I don’t want to have to ask my boyfriend to have sex with me, I want him to want to have sex with me. My question is how do I navigate this situation? When we do have sex it’s good but it’s just not often enough. I’m not sure if there is something wrong with me or if he just really doesn’t care to have sex but it’s really putting a huge strain on the relationship for me. 

Every previous relationship I’ve had I have always had regular sex at least 2 times a week so this is something I’ve never had to deal with before. 

TL;DR : my boyfriend won’t have sex with me because he says he isn’t affectionate, says things will change but never do"
"My husband[35m] lied to me about a secret $150K loan


So early this year I caught my husband with a secret loan that he’s been racking up to do his investing aka gambling. He invested in Facebook a very large amount of money but shortly after the Cambridge analytica scandal broke out and he lost everything. He just kept taking out more loans to try to “win” his money back through more investing. He kept taking out 10k and 20k here and there thinking he will get it all back anyway. And I finally found out when it reached $150K. I was livid that he was lying to me this whole time and the loan was under both our names. I was set to leave even though we have a young child. But he pretty much begged me to stay and said he will work 2 jobs if he has to and will do everything he can do make the money back. I believed him and stayed. Initially he showed that he was trying hard to find another job to make more money but he never did. He just went back to his old routine. 

I just found out this evening that he took out a $10K loan and internet transferred it to his investment account few days ago. I am pregnant and have a 2 year old. I don’t know wtf I should do now. 

TL;DR my husband kept taking out loans to pay for his “investing” aka gambling. He lost $150k and never told me. I just caught him transfer another $10K few days ago."
