"How sensitive are men about going soft during sex?


Basically this happened yesterday with a casual hook up and i made what I thought was a light hearted comment about it (to show it wasn't an issue), next thing I know guy has bailed and that's the end of it. 

I already know penises have a mind of their own and it's not an issue for me, but did I mess up by mentioning it it? Does drawing attention to it, even gently, embarrass someone? 

Have you ever bailed because of something like that? What should I have done instead?"

"How do relationship fights affect men?


All the men (ex-bfs and current bf) I've been with seem really calm during fights, which makes me feel like they're not bothered by what I'm saying. On the other hand, I just need to get all my feelings out there in the open, know that my partner listens and cares and then I'm good to go. I can't end a fight until that's done. 

&amp;#x200B;

However, I noticed that when I already ""finished"" the fight, the men continue mulling over it. Usually it turns out afterwards that they kept thinking about it, or they bring it up again (even days later) after I've already forgotten about it. They sometimes bring up things that I said that expressed dissatisfaction regarding one of their actions, and then  I just don't understand why they don't talk during the fight instead or explain their feelings then. It's strange because during the argument they seem unphased but then after it turns out they actually have been affected by it more than they let on. Can someone give me some insight as to what goes on in your head or how you usually process this? 

&amp;#x200B;

I talked to my bf about this too, but this is sort of a general thing that I've had with all my boyfriends, even my brother and I just wonder how men are different in this than me."

I have career wise picked a bachelors degree for Computer Science, network engineering. I am building myself up with a career but I have 1 more segment that I have to improve, looks.

I have fat on my belly and a bit aroznd, not like beer belly big but it shows a tiny little bit. Losing weight is kinda my top priority as I'm 6'3 and am 100kg in weight. I started running a few times a week but it seems like it isn't enough, gotta improve my diet too.  I'm tired of being average in looks. I'm 20 and never had a serious girlfriend yet and it's probably my fault for not hitting the gym enough and being average. My sense of style is mediocre and want to improve on that aswell but... where do I start with all of this?"

"Am I (30 F) being to sensitive about how infrequently my boyfriend (32 M) wants to have sex with me?


We have been together for a year and wasn’t in a relationship before him since I was like 24 so I don’t have much to compare to. But I worry sometimes that we aren’t having enough sex. We live together and are very busy during the week. He works an extremely stressful job and then works out immediately after work and eats dinner and pretty much calls it a night. We go to bed exhausted. On the weekends we have sex once but I def feel like I have a much higher sex drive than him. I feel like if I didn’t initiate things that he’d be ok with going a few weeks without anything. 

It worries me that he isn’t attracted to me or that I’m doing something wrong. He told me that of course he was attracted to me and that I wasn’t doing anything wrong.  I’ve asked him about it and I asked him if he’s had this problem in the past and he said no. But he told me that it’s also because he is now under so much pressure at work and because of his age that it’s not fair to compare to the past. 

Does this sound legit? Does a men’s sex drive go down around this age? Does that happen when you’re living a stressful life? I obviously don’t want to pressure him into something he isn’t excited about. How often do you guys have sex with your partners? Am I being unreasonable in expecting/hoping for more because I’m comparing my experience to from when I was with a younger man?"
"What do you do when you are extremely bored?


It's summer break and my friends are either to their grandparents or are on a trip to the sea, leaving me alone most of the summer. Videogames are not helping, getting a job is not possible in my country, I am working out but that occupies only 2h of my day and sports I enjoy, like basketball, are not playable on this scorching weather. I am stuck in my house wasting my time mostly with reading and watching YouTube videos. I feel like I am becoming insane!"

"How to I explain to my girlfriend that it is pretty much impossible for me to cum during sex, and that it isn't in any way her fault?


My girlfriend has been feeling very insecure as of late, stemming from not being able to make me finish during sex. This is due to years of porn abuse. I literally am only able to cum if it's my own hand.

That's not to say sex isn't enjoyable, because it is. I stay hard just fine, I just can't finish. And when I actually put effort into trying to finish, I don't enjoy it and I start sweating and my heart starts beating really fast. The two times I was able to finish, I ended up blacking out immediately after. How do I better explain to her that it's not her fault?"
"do you like when a girl makes the first move?


Recently I hit up this guy I used to go to school with, I always thought he was cute but i’m shy so we never got to talk. I almost always wait for guys to come up to me so I wasn’t sure how this would go, but I ended up reaching out to him and things seemed to be going well. Ever since I initiated the conversation he would reach out to me everyday and keep up the conversation but didn’t make plans. So I just asked him if he wanted to hang out and he said yeah. Anyways right after he brought up the fact that I slid into his dm’s and I feel kind of self conscious. I almost feel like I look desperate? I don’t want it to seem that way though. Im overthinking it s little bow"

For anyone who hasn't watched the show, a great proportion of the population can control 1 of the 4 elements which are: Water, Earth, Fire, Air. Only 1 person can control all 4 and that's the Avatar"

"Have you ever just packed up and moved to another province/state to start anew? How come? How did it go?


Am 28. Tired of living/working in my hometown...running into the same people I've known since I was a kid. Went to school, came back home a few years ago and it just feels like I have hit a plateau. Like I'm back where I started.

Feel like I'm at that age where it's like society is telling me to settle down and lay roots. I can't fathom doing that, and honestly I think I'd neck myself if I had to lay roots in my hometown.

I make pretty good money and have been able to save quite a bit just by being frugal and keeping expenses low with the plan to beat this Popsicle stand at some point. 

My plan is to just load up my car with whatever I can carry...and just drive to the other side of the country(Canada)...find a place to live and get a job doing whatever. Meet new people and kinda reinvent/find myself a long the way.

If I'm gonna settle down, it's gonna be where I choose and on my own terms ya know? 

Anybody else felt the same and got out? How'd it go?"

"What was YOUR experience like when being approached by a woman? Aka when a woman made the first move on you.


So I know plenty of guys who say they’d love if women made the first move, but I am a very confident, forward woman and have also had men tell me only “desperate women” do that and that I’m single because I don’t like to play coy or hard to get. 

I will clarify that I’m not subtle about my interest. I’m very blunt because I find that when it does work, it works great in making sure my intentions are clear. Some of my more blunt and less suave Examples include “I think you’re cute. You should ask me for my number so we can text later, if you’re interested.” And “So is this a friendly kind of chat or a flirty kind of chat? I’m cool either way, just want to know in advance before i start revealing my more awkward qualities.” 

Recently a guy friend of mine and a mutual friend of his both said they and most “reasonable men” would be totally turned off if they were approached by a woman who initiating flirting with them. They’d think she was a hoe or desperate. They also added that a woman approaching first takes away the interest and fun of the game. That men only like what they have to work for. And that a woman approaching them from the jump ruins that.

So I wanted to poll all you lovely gentleman for some anecdotal evidence. Have you ever had experiences being hit on/approached/courted by a woman? If so, what was the experience like and how did you feel about it and here afterward? 

Bonus tips on how I should handle future interactions with men of interest would be greatly appreciated."
"How to tell if you're emotionally numb, or if it's just who you are.


I would think the title says it all. But some context.

&amp;#x200B;

Recently, I've had this recurring thought that *maybe* I just have a monotone personality, and have a severe lack of emotions. I obviously can feel happy, sad, or annoyed, etc. But they're not extreme at all. I don't get overly upset when other people would, say, family member dying, or someone screwing you over. I don't get overly excited at news in my life as if I was blessed by some mean or another, whether that be general relationships, or good fortune. It all feels *monogamous.* 

&amp;#x200B;

I don't think I was a normal child either. Most children (I'm talking 4 or 6 year old) think only through emotion. For example, when I was young, six maybe, I was at the park, and it was getting dark. Mum, wanting to leave, and after repeatedly enforcing the idea of leaving, she finally resulted to ""Alright, I'm leaving, get in the car, or I'll leave without you"". I would imagine most kids, even stubborn ones would think emotionally with ""oh no, mummy's going to leave without me! :("". But I still hesitated, because I knew she wouldn't, and I continued to refuse, until the mosquitoes started to eat me a few minutes later.

&amp;#x200B;

I digress, I have suffered depression previously, and I'd consider it situational depression due to *cough cough 'circumstances' at home.* and know how it felt to feel nothing. But this, as I ask the question, feels slightly different. That sort of depression felt like nothing - emotions were almost blocked entirely. This feels bland, watered down, where emotions exist, but are nearly impartial to one another.   


I'm curious to find out if this is just who I am? If it's a problem to be concerned about, or just a personality type. As vague as childhood seems now, the few that remain still felt like I felt a lot, and lived bigger in a way.

&amp;#x200B;

My question is, how do you tell whether or not you just have a bland set of emotions, or if that's just a personality type. Or whether it's an underlying problem that needs some sort of therapy. Has anyone else experienced this sort of existential crisis before? Is it normal? How did you find out, and what did you do?

&amp;#x200B;

(Apologies if this isn't in the guideline of the rules, I don't often open up. In fact the few therapy sessions I had, both professionals thought I was fine, mentally, physically? etc. I don't know if this is specific, I think it's pretty open, but who knows.)"
