"TIFU by trying to tell my parents about Jeff Epstein's suicide.


This literally just happened and I've decided to lock myself in my room until further notice.

I was surfing through my newsfeed this morning and I happened to see news articles that Jeffrey Epstein (rot in hell) has committed suicide. Now, my family and I all talk about current events and politics. My parents were up and about getting ready for the day, so I figure I'll go tell them the news.

Their door was cracked open, so there's the fuck up. I walk in and am greeted by the sight of my mother blowing my dad. As I hear my mom say ""Do ya mind??"", I immediately walk the other way, and back downstairs to my room. All the while trying to burn away what I just saw.

They leave for the weekend at noon, and I have no plans on seeing them again this morning.

TL;DR: Jeff Epstein decided to scar me from beyond the grave."
"TIFU by sleeping with a married woman.


So, this is gonna be long and one hell of a ride. NSFW or for anyone, really. And I may not be alive much longer, because I’m probably going to be murdered.

I’m at the bar the other night, watching the Hall of Fame Game. After it’s over, I go over to charge my phone, and get one last drink before I Uber home. This girl sitting next to me, very attractive. Out of my league. Like wayyy out. I’m just scrolling through memes on my phone. And she asks me 

“hey! Can I trust you to watch my things and not drug me?”

 “Uhh what?”

 “Can you watch my stuff while I go pee and not drug me” 

to which the bartender said “oh you can trust Greg, he’s really nice”. Annnd this is where the bartender fucked up.

Girl comes back from the bathroom, sits back down and started to talk to me. Just random shit. Showed pictures of our dogs to each other. Talked about shows n stuff. Typical ‘meet a girl at a bar’ flirting shit. She asks if I’ve ever seen the show Years and Years. I say “no, but I’ve seen the band perform live”. So she goes on about how great the show is, and how I need to watch it. Asks if I have HBOGO. “Yes because I forgot to cancel my cable after GoT”. So she makes me download the APP, so I could start watching it when I get home. Thanks for the recommendation! I’ll probably check it out never. So a few minutes later, she said

 “hey do you live close by?” 

“Yea, like half a mile”

 “we should go watch the show right now, we can curl up on your couch and watch it together. I have a bottle of whiskey in my car”

“Idk, my house is kind of a mess right now”

“That’s okay, I have pets too” (or something like that. All I was thinking was that this girl wants to bang at this point)

“I mean I guess, but I have to be at work early tomorrow”

“That’s okay, I can only stay 30-40 minutes and then I’ll have to go home”
“That’s fine” heh, cuz that’s all the time I’ll need! AM I RIGHT, FELLAS??

No. Nononono, this was probably one of the biggest mistakes of my life at this point.

It’s about, 11pm at this point. I think? And mind you, I’ve only been talking this girl for maybe 20 minutes.

So we tab out, get in her car. Which is a stick shift. And I say “oh no shit, I like you even more now! No one drives a stick anymore! I drive one every day!” Which I’m excited about, because at this point I’m thinking to myself “hmm this girl is hot, has tattoos, likes shows I like, and imma bout to get laid”

We talked about driving a stick shift the whole time on the way to my house (this is important, because it wasn’t the first time that this subject came up). Which is just a half mile away. So was a short drive. She parks behind my car, blocking my car in.

Go inside, I try to clean up a little bit as she meets and plays with my dog. While I try to get my Chromecast set up on my living room TV. Ya know, to “watch HBOGO”.

She runs outside to her to grab the bottle of whiskey.

It’s fucking Evan Williams.

And this is the first time where an “oh no” thought crosses my mind.

Kids, I’ve slept with some strange in my time. I don’t know how or why I get myself into these situations. I honestly feel that I’m a decent looking, charming, sometimes funny, nice person. Sure I troll the fuck out of people on the interwebs, but I do genuinely care about other people. Being nice does pay off, and karma is a real thing. But in this case, I was dead wrong.

So after some talking about random shit. We get the show playing. I couldn’t even tell you what happened in the first few moments of that show, because she gets up grabs me by the hand, and leads me into my bedroom.

Sex.

So after, we’re just laying there. Pillow talk. Was a good night. I just got laid. She asked if she could stay the night. We’re gonna go to sleep. Everything is cool. I let her know that I have to be at work in a few hours, so I need to get some rest.

Now, up to this point in the story, it all sounds like a great night. Pulled off another one night stand. *high fives all around* Right?

Wrong.

I say “that was great we should do this again sometime”

“I don’t think so”

“What why?”

“I don’t think my husband would appreciate that”



I am speechless. I don’t think I’ve ever felt my heart skip that many beats ever. Millions of thoughts crossed my mind all at once. Like, how the fuck did I not see this coming. Omg imma home wrecker. I’m probably gonna get shot of he finds out.

Me: “Ummmmmmm WHAT? Is this an open relationship? Does he know where you’re at? Like, why didn’t you tell me that?”

Her: “idk, does it matter?”

“Uh yeah, I’d be pretty pissed if I was him”


Now I’ve been cheated on before. And that feeling sucks. I’ve been in a similar situation like, 10 years ago. Where I didn’t know that I was sleeping with someone who had a bf at the time. I had found out a couple days later, and I found him on fb and let him know. He thanked me, and didn’t get mad at me at all. Cheating is the worse thing ever.

So this is where shit starts to hit the fan. I don’t remember the exact conversation, but it went something like this:

Her: “we’re getting separated soon”

Me: “well you’re still fucking married to him”

“Yea but that’s okay”

“How is that okay?”

“He’s been..... abusive”


There’s a slight pause, then she starts crying. So this is where the sober me starts to kick in. This girl is struggling. She’s in a bad spot. And no one should ever lay a finger on a woman. And now I’m trying to empathize with this trashy Evan Williams drinking bitch. Like I legit felt bad from all the shit that she was telling me.

Que the panic attack.

She starts going nuts. Ripping posters off my wall, running around my house butt naked. Knocking shit over. Basically trashing my house.

She asks me to get her medicine out of her purse. Which I do. She takes it. And calms down. (For the most part).

Now this is like, 2 or 3 am now. I tell her that we need to go to sleep. Because I have to work in the morning. She tells me “(bartender) was right, you are a really great guy” Btw, Evan Williams isn’t that bad when you’re slightly inebriated and you just had sex with a crazy bitch.

We finally get to sleep around 4? Maybe? I wake up late, she wants round 3. And who doesn’t like morning sex. I’m still kinda drunk at this point, and could give 0 fucks. So I gave her a fuck.

Anyways, I need to leave for work. But her car is blocking mine. I tell her that she needs to move hers, but she can’t because she didn’t know where her clothes were. And told me I couldn’t move it because “I didn’t know how to drive it” 

“Uhh, this is the third time we’ve had this conversation. I drive a stick every day, I can move your car”

I move her car. I leave for work. And I just let her stay at my house. I let her stay because one, the shit that she told me about her husband is pretty crazy. Two, I was already running late, and fuck it she’ll probably leave before I get home.

A couple hours into my shift, she stops responding to my texts. I get concerned, because I’m starting to sober up, and piecing all this shit together. I came to the conclusion that I should find the husband on fb, and message him, letting him know what happened.... BUT, I see that she had already messaged him. FROM MY FACEBOOK ACCOUNT! My computer was still logged into fb when I left, and I didn’t think to log out or shut it off or anything.

I tell my boss about everything that has happened up until this point. He lets me go home. When I get home, I find her still naked in my bed. I get her friend to get her an Uber. And I leave. Oh also had the sex one more time because 🤷‍♂️.

Go back to work. Thinking everything is over. That’s the end of that. Wrong again.

I get home from work, to find her on my couch wearing one of my shirts. And only that shirt. Like vag all out and everything. This girl is afraid to go home. Which I’m worried about at this point. Because I want her to go somewhere safe. She’s refusing to reach out to any friends and what not.

Oh yea, she had me find her phone. Which had 40 something messages and 28 missed calls from her husband. And several others from other people.

She hands me $20 to order a pizza. And after we eat the pizza, she’d Uber home. Fuckin bet. I ordered the pizza, and she wanted one last round of the sex before the pizza got there.

I kid you not. I’m sitting on one end of the couch, her on the other. And she just opens her legs and says “make it quick”

This bitch has already hit and kicked me, trashed my house, and I’m just ready for her to leave.

Sex.

After, we’re just sitting there, and she starts crying again. Asking to go home. And I’m like 

“I’ll get you an Uber home, but you gotta put pants on”
“No”

“What do you mean ‘no’? You can’t get in an Uber with your pussy out”

“No”


So I gather up all of her belongings and clothes. And try to help her get dressed. To which she refused to allow me to do.

Most guys will agree, one of the hottest things ever... That “arch” thing that women do when you’re pulling their panties off is a fucking amazing feeling.

#I had the same feeling when I got her panties ON.

Pizza arrives. I go outside, sign for the pizza n stuff. Come back inside. Panties are off again. God dammit.

We never even opened the pizza box. She’s saying that she wants to go home. But is refusing to get dressed. I’m starting to panic myself. Because I don’t know how I got myself into this situation. But, am me.

She eventually hands me her phone, with the conversation that’s she having with her husband. And I read through the conversation, it’s her sending multiple texts saying “I’m so sorry babe” “idk where I’m at” “come get me”. And him saying “nope sorry” “this is on you” and “call 911”

That last one though. That’s what I did.

Before I called 911, I offered to drive her car back to the bar where we met, because I knew the husband would give her a ride back there. And not to my house. Because now I’m starting to worry about my safety. I don’t want homeboy to show up on my porch with a shotty. But then again she states that “you don’t know how to drive my car” with it being a stick and all. Even though this is 4th or 5th time this was brought up in conversation.

I told them that I have an inebriated woman in my house that is refusing to leave, even though she wants to leave. Etc. I tried to call our one mutual friend, (the bartender from the previous night) but she didn’t answer.

The ~20 minutes before the cops arrived were the most awkward 20 minutes of my life. This girl is drunk crying. Trying to get me to go for yet another round. Where at this point, my dick hurts. Also, “girl you need to get dressed, you’re gonna be going home”

Finally got her panties back on, I didn’t tell her that I had called the cops. I told her that the Uber was coming. And was trying to get her to put her pants on.

Cops show up, I go outside. Explain the situation, was kind of freaking out. But I kept my calm. I told them that I was concerned about her safety, because of all the shit that she told me about her husband. But they can’t force her to go anywhere she didn’t want to. She wanted to go home. Officers ask if she was presentable. I pop my head back in the door. She’s still wearing my shirt and her panties. So I’m like “I guess?”, and then I let them in.

She yells “are you fucking serious? You called the cops?” 
“Uh yea, you didn’t wanna leave. Even though you said you did. Plus your husband said to call 911, so that’s what I did”

The officer said to her “you’re on this man’s property, and he wants you to leave”

Que crying and what not.

Cops ask me to gather all of her stuff. Which I do. Her husband calls her phone, so I accept the call, and then put it up to her face. Tell her to tell him what’s happening. And that she is getting an Uber home. Apparently her card and PayPal was getting declined for the ride. So she couldn’t do it herself. They live like 5 miles away from me, so it was only $8 or something. I live pretty close to downtown, so ordering a Lyft/Uber usually takes 2-3 minutes after calling for one. Once cops tell her that her ride is on the way, and gonna be here within 2 minutes... Girl finally decides to get dressed.

I had to help a 30 year old woman put pants on... I could see the officer’s partner struggling to keep a straight face during that ordeal. Lol.

Anyways, I hand her hat, keys, bra, shirt (she’s still wearing mine) to the officer. Made sure she had all of her belongings. We get her to walk out of my house to the Uber. But she tried to grab the bottle of Evan Williams. To where I audibly laughed. “I don’t think they’ll let you take that”

Cops didn’t let her take it. She got in the Uber and she was gone. Policeman handed me the bottle back. Where I say “usually this is the other way around, ha”

Po-po leave, I call it a night, and it’s over.

Flash forward to today. I get a message from our mutual friend (the bartender) and she’s asking if crazy girls keys are at my house. I was at work at the time. So I wasn’t able to check. But I’m 98% certain I handed those over to the cops. I look for them when I get home. Found nothing.

Oh, and this girls car is still parked across the street from my house.

So that brings us to now. I haven’t heard anything from her. Or the husband. And I’m not sure if it’s safe for me to go home. But ya. Know what? Fuck it. I’m glad I could share this story with y’all. There might be more to come, but you’ll probably have to read about it in my obituary.

The moral of the story is, drug every girl that asks you not to drug them at a bar. 😂

Jk don’t do that.

And don’t stick your dick in crazy.

TLDR: Took a girl home who I didn't know was married. She trashed my house due to several"
"TIFU by saying I was tired to my wife.


Came home from the gym. Its leg day. Had full day at work too. Work isn't bad. Came home to happy kids. Wife does a great job at keeping them alive. The best. Had to take a shower before bed. Wife says hurry because shes tired. I empathize by saying I will hurry because I am also tired. Bad idea. Wife proceeds to tell me how she is the most tired because of kids. I do not dispute this since I am not a total moron. Kids are exhausting but totally worth it. I tell her as much. She is most tired. I am only kind of tired. Not good enough. She is more tired. I agree with this in order to ease the tension. Unsuccessful. She is fully triggered by the fact that I had the audacity to say that I was tired. There is no escape. Am screwed. 


Tldr: am not allowed to be tired. Ever."
"TIFU by looking at my fiances location history and found out that she has been cheating on me.


Obligatory ""this happened two days ago.""

I had been together with my girlfriend for almost 4 years. I proposed to her about a month ago, she said yes, and we were incredibly happy! Or so I thought. 

About 3 weeks after our proposal, I notice she starts acting different. Not having sex with me, looking away/down when we kiss. She had also been spending way too much time (at least 4 days of M-F each week) with her coworkers drinking beer after work, driving home drunk, and often pretty late. I went to a few of these gatherings but didn't really enjoy getting slammed on a monday night when I have work the next day, so I often opted out.

We would also share our google location with each other at all times. Mostly because she traveled to sketchy places for work, and I would regularly go on trails, so it helped each of us know the other was safe. I looked at her location one day and it was turned off. I texted her about it and she said that she kept receiving notifications about it so she had turned it off. Hadn't been a problem for the past year. She turned it back on, and it was off again the next day. She also had two phones, a personal and a work phone, which she would keep both with her at all times. I only had the location for the personal phone. Eventually she stopped using her personal phone and only used the work phone.

Two days ago, about a month after the proposal, I decided to snoop because my suspicion was at it's highest, and I just wanted to put it to rest. I used her computer to log into her gmail account and looked at her timeline. She had been going to an address across town about 10 times in the past two weeks. I called her immediately because she said she was at the office finishing up some work that was due the next day. She said she was at work, but leaving to go to the grocery store, which she then did.

I waited until she got home and confronted her about it. She said she had been meeting a guy from work just to talk and hang out, but she didn't want to tell me because she thought I would get mad. Turns out, she met him for the first time about 2 days after the proposal, and started seeing him at his house within that week. I kept prying, asking her more questions, she told me they had only kissed twice, then it turned into they had made out, and she denied every accusation of sleeping with him every time I asked.

The next day when I got home from work, I asked to see her phone to read the messages between the two of them. She said she deleted them. So I said I wanted to look at it anyways, just to be sure. I started recovering the data from the last backup. She sat down beside me while I was doing it, and asked what I was doing. I told her, and the look of panic in her face was real! So she starts talking about feelings and all this other crap while the phone is recovering. I asked her one last time, ""before I look at this, is there anything you want to tell me?"" She was silent. I asked flat out ""did you sleep with him?"" and she said yes. Turns out that she met with him almost every day, starting about 8 days after the proposal and had sex with him most of those. Funny enough, the data recovery didn't even work. So that's a win I guess.

Planning on moving my stuff out later this week to a new place. Havn't told her yet. Still can't believe she started cheating on me less than two weeks after she said yes to my proposal, and even more so with someone she met a few days after the proposal. Feels shitty but I'm keeping my head up.

TLDR; TIFU by looking at my fiances location history and found out she started sleeping with another guy less than two weeks after she said yes to my proposal. It has been one month since the proposal now."
"TIFU by announcing to my daughter that I only shave my vag when her dad is due home


This literally just happened about an hour ago and had me and my husband alternating between cringing in embarrassed, and giggling like a couple of immature schoolchildren.

For context, my husband works away at sea for weeks at a time; he is due to leave later today, so is busy getting organised and packed up ready to go. 

He realised that he has ran out of razor blades, so being the loving wife that I am, I offered him one of my unused razor blades to tide him over until he can buy more on the mainland.
He commented that he didn't want to leave me short, and I assured him that that wouldn't be the case as I use an epilator on my legs and underarms, and only shave my foo-foo when he's due home. Cue my daughter walking into the kitchen at that exact moment and awkwardly making eyecontact with me before walking back out the way she had come. 

TL;DR Basically the title, and the fact that my 13-year-old daughter has learnt a bit more about her mother than probably either of us are comfortable with her knowing."
"TIFU by not paying attention to my wifes bathroom usage.


This came to a head on sunday night, I've been married for a bit, we had that lovey dovey time, super close, so cute it would a puppy look like a shiftless bobo by comparison. my wife would always leave super early for work, but thats fine. Some people like getting to work early and it seemed to fit that she would be the type to do that.

Then she started having to run errands at night for some reason. She would either leave like 2 hours early for work or go run errands at like 10. This was fine for a few weeks. Then she started coming home with none of the supplies we she said she needed. I dont know why she needed milk or bananas urgently at 10pm, but it raises red flags when you urgently need milk at 10 and then you return with no milk. That this had been going on for months probably doesnt bode well for my entrance for the worlds smartest man competition, which is something i assume that smart people have. I wouldnt know.

My mind jumps to affair. The love of my life is out gallivanting around with some shit bag, probably with a cool name like devin and a magnum dong. stupid devin. I figured i would test this theory by offering my own dong to her the next time she had to take a late night errand run. I basically fell short of presenting it to her on a silver platter. She declined, said maybe when she gets back. Like i wanted devins sloppy seconds. So i follow her. There is a dennys down the road from our house. She gets out and goes in. Im in my car, imagining how im going to put the pain on this slick jerk while berating my wife. I go inside and i cant find her. Nowhere to be seen. Its just me, the dennys hostess and a bunch of drunk devins. She finally comes out, and has a shocked face. ""How can you do this to me!"" The fact that i wasnt immediately asked to leave the dennys should tell you all you need to know about dennys. My wife starts sobbing and apologizing. ""You're caught, where is the guy?."" ""What?"" ""Dont do this right now, where is the guy?"" ""There isnt a guy."" ""Why are we at dennys if there isnt a guy."" At this point it became clear we werent going to be having a meal of microwave steak or whatever it is they serve at dennys so we are asked to leave and not come back. In the parking lot, sobbing continues and i have no idea whats going on. ""Wife.......why are you at dennys at 10pm if you arent cheating with a guy.....is it, the hostess?"" ""I had to use the bathroom."" Uncontrolled sobbing. ""What....you had to what?"" ""I had to go to the bathroom."" ""We have a toilet, in the home we share."" ""I dont go when you are there ok, i dont like it, i cant relax with you there."" ""A dennys, a dennys bathroom, thats better to you than going, at our home, with me present?"" Memories and oddities start flooding in, our honeymoon where she kept going to the lobby to ask for things, innumerable amount of times she would leave at weird times to run errands, the gas station, the store. I just never noticed, never second guessed it. She stopped bringing stuff back because for a long time she would get bananas. So many bananas in our house i guess i mentioned it, so she just stopped grabbing anything. Her  shame was brought down by bananas. I could have been blissfully unaware, living in a banana filled house that i and i alone used the bathroom in if not for that comment. So, thats the story of how im not allowed in dennys because i thought she was cheating on me with devin.

TL;DR my wife had an affair with a dennys toilet"
"TIFU when using the shower head to masturbate


Alrighty it’s now the morning after;  I am so embarrassed with myself and my hubby won’t stop laughing at me. 

Last night hubby &amp; I had our first child free night in over 6 months (thanks for baby sitting grandma) &amp; headed over to a friends place for a bbq &amp; drinks around the bonfire. 

As usual, as the night progresses the conversation turns to the topic of sex &amp; masturbation. One of my girls friends starts talking about using the shower head to... you know 😉

As a 35 year old woman I had literally never thought to use the shower head for any other pleasure than washing my body. Sure, I have toys (I’m no prude) but I had never thought about using an everyday home appliance for my own pleasure down there. 

The night ended and we went home. Smelling of the bonfire I tell hubby I’m having a shower &amp; he says he doesn’t care, he’s going to bed. 

I should admit I was pretty tipsy by the time we got home (we took an Uber in case anyone’s concerned we drove under the influence). 

I’m washing myself  and my hair and the thought hits me. Ok, imma try the shower head... 

Ok feels good but need more pressure.. 

Ok feels better but I could still use more pressure.. 

Ohh ok that’s just right. Yeah that’s the spot... oh YEAH THAT’S THE SPOT!!!!! 

...Screaming: Ahhhhhhhhhhh fuuuuuuuccckkkk! 

Just as I was having a mind blowing orgasm, my leg jerked and gave way. I slid to the left and went crash right into the shower screen, smashing it as I managed to land out of the shower holding myself planking on the toilet. 

Hubby came running in and I’m telling you it was a fucking sight. 

I’m planked from the shower across the toilet (In like a stiff leaning position), glass everywhere, a bit of blood and a shower head just dangling from the wall going at full speed while I’m crying from the pain and laughing from the embarrassment. 

I fucked up y’all. 

It takes hubby a few seconds to compose himself because he thinks this is the funniest shit that’s ever happened. 

I managed only a few cuts to my left arm from basically flying with the glass onto the toilet and a few cuts on my feet. Lucky.

Anyway we went to the ED because I did have a few decent cuts but I only ended up needing 2 stitches in my arm and 3 on the side of my foot from where some glass got stuck. Again, lucky. 

I told the nurse &amp; doctor that I slipped while cleaning the shower. You know, because most people clean their shower at 1am. 

I’ll be telling our landlord the same thing today. 

TL;DR if you’re going to masturbate in the shower, set yourself up so you don’t go flying through the shower screen because you’re unexpectedly great at pleasuring yourself with the shower head."
"TIFU By letting my cat put his head in my mouth.


Throwaway account for obvious reasons. This just happened a few minutes ago. I was laying on my couch and my cat decided to jump up and lay on my chest as he often does. I had just eaten lunch, which was a chicken salad sandwich, so naturally my cat was intrigued by the smell and wanted to get a good whiff. He was sniffing around my face heavily, almost comically. I was feeling pretty generous at that time so I got the brilliant idea to open my mouth really wide to let him enjoy, but also because I was curious how far he would venture in. He got his head about halfway in when suddenly he decided to let out a violent and very wet sneeze right into my mouth. I'm fucking disgusted, and the weekend has been ruined before it even started. 

TLDR: My cat sneezed directly in my mouth."
"TIFU by finding my GF's porn videos and confronting her about it


This actually did happen today and I'm still kind of shaken up from my initial reaction.


Basically me and my GF of almost 3 years now are in a long distance relationship due to us both being in college. We're both from the same hometown so during summer we can see each other freely because we both come home to work. Long Distance is hard as fuck, so summer is a great time for us to fuck like Catholics to make up for the time we spent apart. Fortunately she's on the pill so we don't have to use condoms. Great right? Wrong.


Last night we were hanging out and were going to get busy, but she ended up getting a headache and as a result wasn't in the mood. I went home with blue balls, and decided that I was tired too and just wanted to sleep it off. After going in and out of sleep, I eventually decided that I needed to get off, and ol' reliable would have to do.


I loaded up pornhub and started browsing through the videos until I found one of those casting tapes that looked good enough for me. I got the lotion ready and lathered up my meat scepter, but stopped to do a double take. The girl in the video looked like my girlfriend. Exactly like my girlfriend. I was thinking ""Oh cool this is basically like jerking off to moving nudes"", and began to jack it.


But once the fucking started, my heart stopped. She had the same birthmark as my GF did, same spot below her ass, same shape and everything. This wasn't a look alike, this WAS my girlfriend. I grabbed my earbuds to plug in, and sure enough, it was her voice speaking to the camera explaining how she was doing this because she needed money for college.


I checked below the video title and saw that it linked the actors/actresses and saw her screen name. I was hesitant, but clicked on it. Turns out this wasn't a one time quick cash deal, because on my screen I was looking at page after page, video after video of my GF being railed by giant porn dicks. My girl wasn't as innocent as I thought. She was a porn starlet.


I was so fucking torn right then. So many feelings started running through my brain. It now made sense why she suddenly decided to go on the pill last year without really having a reason. She was always complaining about money so this made sense why she would do it.


I then started freaking out about STDs. None of the videos had the guys using condoms and several were creampies. We were both each other's firsts so once she was on the pill we ditched condoms because we knew neither of us had anything, but now I was terrified I had been duped. Not to mention we had been plowing like crazy over the past few months, so my worries were heightened because this was very much recent. I realized that it was late enough that I couldn't do anything so I went to bed again.


I woke up the next morning in cold sweats. I was angry, pissed, and emotionally a wreck. I sent a text to my girlfriend calling her a slut and a liar and everything in the book I could think of. I called up my doctor's office and scheduled an STD test. Fortunately they could take me right then so I drove over. 


After the tests were finished, I got a text from my girlfriend. ""What the fuck are you talking about???"". I was even angrier than before. That little bitch was gonna act dumb about it?  I was furious, but I had evidence. She wasn't gonna get out of this one without some explaining. 


I fired up pornhub again to find the videos, but I couldn't find the casting one I started on last night. No worries, I remember her stage name. I typed it into the search bar, again surprised by what I found. Not because I was looking at her being railed by other dudes again, but because the videos weren't there. They didn't exist.


Now I was just fucking confused. I tried other porn websites, but came up with the same results: nothing. I knew I saw them last night tho, so I knew they were there though, right?


And that's when the realization hit. Remember how I said I was drifting in and out of sleep before getting up to jerk it? It was all a dream. A very bad dream. My brain decided that a great dream to have would be my Girlfriend being a pornstar, forcing me to watch her bang other dudes.


So here I am explaining to my girlfriend like an idiot how I had a dream she was a pornstar without my knowledge, apologizing for all the names I called her, and sitting in awe at how badly this could've turned out. Fortunately she seems to be mostly understanding of this, so I think we're good for now.


TL;DR: Had a very realistic dream that my GF was doing porn, gave myself a heartache, sent her a very angry text over nothing, and wasted my morning in a Doctors office taking STD tests for diseases I don't have."
"TIFU by eating out my fiancé while her water broke


quite possibly the best and worst day of my life :(  


my fiancé was 8 1/2 months pregnant and her hormones have been out of control.  She has been craving sex constantly.  I can't keep up with her, so i typically would just eat her out until she orgasms and call it a day.    


Today, she initiated once again at 3am when I was sleeping.  I sighed and just automatically went down on her.  About ten minutes later I feel a wet substance against my lips.  She has never squirted with me so i got excited at first.  It tasted really weird, but i didn't want to make her self conscious, so I said ""Damn babe, I didn't know you could squirt!""   and not a moment later, she let out a horrifying groan that not even I could mistake for an orgasm; her water broke.  I knew what was happening immediately.  I turned on the lights and paternal instinct kicks in and i drive her to the hospital.    


When i got her there and she was in labor, i couldn't stay in.  I suppressed how nasty that incident was until i remembered suddenly and left the room to vomit violently.  I still gag at the thought.    


Shortly after i was introduced to the 8lb. 4 oz. love of my life.  This is both the best and the worst day of my life.  


TLDR: i ate my wife out while her water broke."
"TIFU by singing 'Candy Shop' by 50 Cent to myself in the men's room mirror and getting caught by my boss


Don't even ask, ok. I was having a bad day and I guess I needed to let off some steam. The men's room was empty, I did my business, went to wash my hands and it just ... happened.

Was on a trawl of throwback 00's hits the other day, and for some reason 'Candy Shop' by 50 cent (of ALL the songs) has been stuck in my head a few days. I started off mildly enough with the first verse, by the time I got to the chorus I was well into it and then by the second verse I was away. I was 50. 

Halfway through the second verse, the toilet flushes behind me. 

I finally understood what it means when people describe the heart as standing still. Literally I was frozen with fear. Paralysed. Side note: whoever was in there hadn't locked the door. WHO DOES THAT? 

I didn't stay to find out who it was. I went back to my desk chair, fatigued with embarrassment. A few moments later, my boss walks in. He doesn't say anything, just grins at me and walks on to his office. I genuinely felt like I wanted to chunder. 

TL;DR: My boss caught me singing a grossly inappropriate song and now I either have to hand in my notice or live in eternal shame. 50 Cent, I hate you man."
"TIFU by showing my cat a plushie that looks like her


At the office today, there was a raffle for some stuffed animal toys and I won one. I chose one that looked almost exactly like my cat thinking I'd get a cute photo of them together.

I get home and put the toy on the bed next to her and snap a photo. She doesn't care, but hey, mission accomplished. 

Fast forward 6 hrs and I'm playing Rollercoaster Tycoon 2. I suddenly hear my cat howling up a storm and look over to the bed and she is crying at the stuffed version of herself. She's picking it up by the neck, dragging it around, setting it down, staring into its lifeless eyes, and just crying nonstop. 

I take it away from her but she doesn't stop howling. Her fur is all puffed up and her eyes look so scared. I think she thought it was a dead cat. I open the door to my room and she bolts out and starts cowering in the furthest corner of the apartment from my room. She won't let me near her.

I feel like a villain. I love her more than anything and now she's fearing for her life.

Tldr; I brought a stuffed cat toy home for my cat. She thought I brought her a dead cat and freaked out."
"TIFU by having sex with my wife.


Today was about 4 weeks ago. I work in sales and the wife and I went to a big yearly conference at a fancy hotel in a major city a few hours away. It’s always a fun conference. Lots of free food and booze, with a very nice hotel room. A 4 day all expenses paid getaway with no kids is always fun, and allows for some much needed one on one time as a couple. 

After our main event and dinner on Friday (and the 3 hour open bar), my wife and I and some clients went to a local pub and had a few more drinks to cap off the night. The wife and I waked back to the hotel instead of unerring (only about 6 blocks) down the walking path next to a nice waterway that flows through the area of town we were in. Beautiful night, drunk, and romantic walk back to the hotel led to some fun time in the room. 

Fast forward to yesterday. We have 2 kids, boy (2) and girl (6). We love our kids and our life. About 2 months ago, we finally decided we were done having kids. We had talked about a third for over a year, but decided we had one of each, and the oldest being 6-7 years older than the youngest would be too big of a gap. So, I scheduled a vasectomy for August 1st. I went in Thursday and got the snip. Easy peasy. Now, just 3 days of relaxing with a bag of peas on my man bits. Probably binge some shows, game a bit, you know... As I’m sitting on our couch watching Lucifer, my wife walks in to the living room with 3 positive pregnancy tests... Wtf. Apparently the proper precautions weren’t taken in our night of drunken love making. 

So... Baby #3 it is.

TL;DR I had drunken sex with my wife and didn’t use protection or pull. On the day after my vasectomy we find out we’re pregnant."
"TIFU by asking about my parenta divorce and found out I contributed to the divorce.


Okay, first off, my parents have been divorced for 12+ years. I am 21 now and was 7 or 8 when they split. I found out a few years ago it was because my mom was cheating on my Dad with my nurse from the NICU from 1997 (oof).

Casually talking to my mom (who has since remarried for the THIRD time) I asked about their divorce out of curiosity. She went into a few details and brought up a car ride with my Dad. She wouldnt elaborate so I called my Dad (BIG MISTAKE)

Mind you, Dad took me and my sister in when my mom left and raised us. It kind of went like this:

Me: ""So I was talking to mom about your divorce and she brought up a ride in the car with you that initiated the divorce""

Dad: *hesitantly* "" Yeah, you, me and your sister were in the car when I came back from overseas and we were talking about what you guys wanted to be when you grew up. Your sister said something and you said ""I want to be a nurse like, [insert his name here]"". I pulled over to the side of the road and you spilled the beans""

Apparently, at 7 or 8, I informed my dad about a guy staying in OUR house in HIS room sleeping in THEIR bed while he was gone for months for military stuff. I told him EVERYTHING. How mom told us he was an ""old friend"" who needed ""help"" and who would be staying with us ""to protect us while Daddy is gone"". How he watched us for a week while mom disappeared, took us to movies, dinner, etc. I even remember him asking if I would move to California with him and my mom (they got married 2 weeks after my parents divorce was finalized and moved to California)

I never remembered this. He said he went home, pulled phone records, emails and even the chat messenger history (this is like 2004 or 2005 idk).

I'm not blaming myself, but, damn. Little me saved my Dad's ass from being used any longer by her.

Note to self: dont ask too many questions.
Insert big ""WHAT THE FUCK"" here

TL;DR. TIFU by asking too many questions about my parents divorce and found out I'm the one who dimed my mom out for infidelity.

Edit: This is a fuck up because I was apparently never supposed to know - hence my mom not wanting to talk about it and my dad being hesitant on telling me."
"TIFU by drinking Starbucks.


I’m currently in bed, huddled under the covers and riding out the shockwaves of trauma from this event. 

My first fuck-up was trying to cut out caffeine a few months ago. I succeeded, but also lost my tolerance for caffeine (was drinking an average of 8 espresso shots throughout the day). 

Today, maybe two hours ago, I went to a doctors appointment. This appointment was in a huge hospital, one that had a food court and of course, a Starbucks. It was a mental-health related program, so I was a bit on-edge afterwards. I saw the sign for Starbucks and the clouds of depression began to life. Oh hell yes, the sweet nectar of life beckons to me. 
I get in line and order a medium sized coffee, cream and sugar - something tame, I thought to myself. Not tame enough apparently. 

I got in the car and started to drive home. About ten minutes away, I feel a bubbling in my gut. Oh boy. It’s fine, I say to myself, I can make it home without incident. Oh, how wrong I was. 

While I had been focused on keeping my asshole clenched, I had forgotten that nearly every road and intersection on my way home was clogged up by construction. Detours everywhere. Every time I thought I was getting close to home, I was forced to backtrack and drive a few streets over. At this point, I’m sweating and shaking, my legs are essentially vibrating, and I have no idea how I haven’t passed out at the wheel yet. 

And then it hits me. The cramps. I got my fucking period. IN THE CAR. 

Any person with a uterus will tell you how bad cramps are until they are blue in the face. I will do the same, because when I ovulate, I get cysts all over my ovaries due to PCOS (Polycystic Ovarian Syndrome). Needless to say, it makes everything way more awful than it needs to be. 

My abdomen tightens up, trying to force all of the coffee-afterbirth and uterine tissue out of me, but I resist. I will NOT shit my car, and I certainly will not bleed onto my seats. That shit isn’t even paid off yet. 

I get re-routed for what feels like the millionth time, and finally I see it: a road to home with no construction. I step on the gas and swing around every corner with the gumption and moxie of an F1 driver. In doing this, I have fucked up again. 

I currently have an inner-ear infection, and in my haste I have shaken up all the liquid in my cochlea. Vertigo. Vertigo like you wouldn’t believe. 

To recap: I’m holding in a torrent of liquid regret, clenching my pelvic floor muscles to keep as much of my uterus inside of me as possible, and now I’m dizzy enough that I could no longer tell if my eyes were crossed or not. 

I fly into my driveway, throw my car in park and yank my keys out. I run to my porcelain throne as fast as my entirely clenched body would allow me, all the while bumping into things in my way because the vertigo hadn’t gone away yet and I was effectively as coordinated as a drunk person. 

When I say it was a photo finish, I’m not joking. I started shitting BEFORE my ass even hit the toilet (everything landed in the bowl tho, thankfully). I was sitting there for, legitimately, nearly 45 minutes. 100% liquid. And it didn’t stop for more than three seconds at a time. Once it was over I felt like I had run a marathon wearing lead boots. All of my energy was gone. I crawled upstairs on my hands and knees with the intent of getting in bed, but had to make a mad dash for the bathroom once again and do it all a second time. Finally got myself in the shower to rinse off all of my sweat and potential residue of my poor choices... and then had to stop mid-shower for a third round of misery. I feel another round coming, so this is probably the end of my post. 

TL;DR - If you’re drinking coffee and have to drive home immediately after, maybe shit before you leave the coffee shop."
"TIFU by treating my Horse like a Dog


Technically, my fuck up was last night. Let me start by saying, I rent a beautiful home in the country on 200 acres of land. I have a horse, dog, and 3 cats. My horse lives in a field in my backyard. 6 acres of beautiful grass, hills, a stream, and a huge 20x10ft stall, all properly fenced.

Last week, my horse bruised his foot and was limping. I decided to put up a temporary fence in my yard and keep my lame horse in my backyard where the ground is soft and the grass is greener. He could barely walk so there was really no concern over him escaping. He was beyond over joyed.

Yesterday, I had the ferrier come and fix his shoes as he was no longer limping. Here's where the fuck up  begins. I loved having my horse in the backyard. It was like having a giant dog hanging out with me. So I figured, what's the harm in one more night?

6 am, my phone is ringing. It's my landlord. There are 12 state trooper at my house trying to wrangle my horse who is leisurely strolling down the main road. He was fine, they had fun, my horse made friends with a super sweet lady trooper who was giggling the whole time she was walking him back home while he was nuzzling her face.

Not nearly the worst of fuck ups but I thought everyone might enjoy something that doesn't involve sex.

TLDR: Treated my horse like a dog for a week while he was injured, only to have him escape when he felt better, causing a closed road and a bunch of state troopers a fun morning playing cowboy."
"TIFU by quoting a kid's movie at the end of sex.


This happened around 5 years ago when I was still in university. 

I was not the most forthcoming 5 years ago, I didn't know how to 'be' around women, let alone, god forbid, have sex with said women. 

As surprising as it may seem then, I was going through quite the 'dry spell' that year, and had resigned myself to studying instead and little else. 

However, as with all things in life, the moment you stop you looking is the moment you find it. 

I found myself back at this girl's house who was studying in the UK for that year. She was from Slovenia (somewhat unimportant detail other than those Brits who voted 'Leave' and now see me as part of the EU problem somehow) and absolutely gorgeous. I was punching way, way above my weight and thought I should relish every one of the seconds I knew I was going to enjoy with this girl. 

Again, unsurprisingly, I did not quite go the distance. I was however, in a state of absolute delirium - that post-orgasm 'fuzz' where everything in the world seems grand, and nothing could take that away.

Apart from me, of course. 

She, rightly so, tried to, y'know, get me going again, for my first attempt was so poor. 

However, in my state of delirium, and ultimately recovery, I was in no fit state to do so just yet. 

As she goes to sit atop of me, my brain goes into a strange autopilot. 

I gently push her to the side to stop her sitting down on me. Ok, that's bad enough, but it didn't stop there.

I, for entirely unknown reasons say the words 'That'll do pig, that'll do'. In exactly the same way as that immortal final line from the kid's movie called 'Babe' (about a pig, funnily enough). 

As it transpires, this movie was not a hit in Slovenia, and no amount of me pleading 'IT'S A KID'S MOVIE' at her seemed to help as she slowly got dressed and opened the door for me. 

TLDR: Ended a dry spell with a knockout girl, refused round two by calling her a farmyard animal."
"TIFU by explaining what happens when you mix baking soda and acid to someone unprepared for that information.


 Years back when I was working auto parts. There was a kid working there, I'll call him J.

J was still in high school, and a good kid, but woefully under-educated on some things, the sciences being among them.

So one day, some battery acid has spilled and I tell J to grab the neutralizer (it's a giant bag of baking soda). He grabs the bag and sprinkles some on the spill and watches it fizz with fascination. I notice this and ask if he never did the old ""make-you-own-volcano"" thing with baking soda and vinegar as a kid? Nope, has no idea what I'm talking about.

I explain how it releases carbon dioxide, and quite a bit of it, and can build up pressure. Makes the volcano explode/erupt. J gets a gleam in his eye and disappears off to the back of the store.

The next time I see him, he has a plastic gatorade bottle half filled with neutralizer, and he has a paper cup of battery acid he has siphoned or poured out of cores. I ask what he's doing and he pours in on the neutralizer and watches it bubble. He goes to put the cap on.

Me: STOP! Do *NOT* do that.

J: What?

Me: Get that out of here! Outside, carefully! Right, now!

J starts walking but didn't listen and threaded on the cap. He made it about 5 feet before he jostled it. At which point blew out both the top and the bottom of the bottle simultaneously, and proceeded to powder bomb the entire front of the store. J looks like he was beaten with an open sack of flour, luckily none in his eyes.

He got the spend the next several hours pulling boxes and wiping them down, and shelves, and counters, floors in the storefront. While I had to handle all the customers, phones and wiping down all of the above behind the counter. Everything was covered in a fine layer of baking soda. We got everything cleaned up except the ceiling, which still had the marks of a white explosion on it directly above the accident, even after cleaning it off as best as we could. We let that remain a mystery.

TL;DR Baking soda bomb blows up in my store. Glitter would have been preferable."
"TIFU by getting a handjob from my girlfriend on the day she leaves for college


This happened a few hours ago so I’m still feeling wired.

So basically, my girlfriend leaves tomorrow to go far away to school in Miami. She’s a year older than me so I’m not going anywhere. My parents are uber religious, very adamant that we have a non physical relationship. 

Earlier today we were in my basement having a little fun as we do. My mom was upstairs but we’ve never had a problem with her coming down while we do stuff. Anyway, there I was, about to blow my load, when I hear “OP and SO, that’s too far”. Somehow my mom had walked downstairs completely silently so we didn’t hear anything. But of course, like all the TIFUs, I was about to cum, so, dick in my girlfriends hand, I shot the fattest load all over myself, her arm, and the couch. I immediately pulled my pants up so my mom wasn’t staring at my dick any longer than necessary. Thankfully she walked outside without saying anything else. 

We’re going out to dinner now, but I know how absolutely FUCKED I will be when I get home tonight. What a way to spend the last day with my girlfriend.

TL;DR: Blew my load in front of my religious mom on my girlfriends last day at home."
"Tifu by jokingly putting my thumb in my wife at the grocery store


People who are married know that you always find ways to mess with your spouse. I always either slide my hand up/down her buttcrack or push in her butthole area when she bends over. Well today we were in the frozen foods isle of the grocery store and while she was bending over I thought it would be funny to put my thumb in her butt while she was grabbing the food. Normally my wife wears jeans/yoga pants but today she decided to wear some shorter shorts. So as she is bent over I do thumbs up gesture and proceed to shove it where the sun dont shine. Unfortunately the shorts were a little loose and a little too short so my thumb didnt stop where I had anticipated. I clearly felt my thumb go into my wife, not even sure what hole at this point but  she shoots straight up hitting her head on a rack of frozen vegan entrees and she screams. Completely shocked, we both start dying laughing. At the end of it she goes well at least I can cross off getting finger blasted in a grocery store from my bucket list.  
  
Tl;dr tifu by jokingly trying to put my thumb near my wife's bhole in public and my finger slid right past her short shorts and thong and straight into her hole. Not sure which one."
"TIFU Update: sleeping with a married woman


Not only has this been the craziest week of my entire life, it might probably be any individual's craziest week ever.

In my last [post](https://old.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/clt0i3/tifu_by_sleeping_with_a_married_woman/), that blew up wayy beyond my expectations. A lot has happened since then. Aside from multiple messages, hate, getting a girl's phone number, and disbelief of that story... Let me tell ya folks, it is very, very real.

I was told that the husband came into the bar looking for a red headed guy with a beard named ""Jonathan"". So unless he reads the original post on the Reddits, I'm safe. I think.

Her car is finally gone. And I haven't heard anything from the husband directly, but this shit has gotten juicier.

I shared the post with a friend that I had lost touch with, because life and everything. And figured she'd get a kick out of this insanity. She asks what her name was. I tell her, and she was like ""OMG I WAS GUESSING THAT YOU WERE GONNA SAY ________"" Well then I ask for a picture, to confirm if it's the same girl.

[FUCK MY LIFE](https://i.imgur.com/DOzdqoD.png)

So once my heartbeat comes down, and texting this mutual friend about the situation. I get this [reassurance](https://i.imgur.com/GjUplx2.png). She said she'd message him, and would have my back.

Wellllll, [shit.](https://i.imgur.com/uP86Z0X.png)

As I go to sleep dreading the final outcome of this already fucked up situation...I woke up this morning to more hate and other messages from my original post. I text the friend, letting her know that the car is finally gone. and was also eager to hear what the husband had said back to her.

[Blame it on the Goose](https://i.imgur.com/BCOx7hH.png)

I am hoping this is all over now. HOPING. There is so much fucked up'd in this story with everyone involved. Myself included. I get home from running my errands and lunch n stuff today. My across the street neighbor approaches me.

[At least I'm not Jeremy](https://i.imgur.com/idTxr9d.png)

In conclusion, be careful of what you stick your dick in. I wish I was making all of this up. I do appreciate all the comments and laughs from the last post. And more importantly you taking the time to read it. I do have similar stories to tell. But Imma wait for this smoke to settle before I get into that.

TLDR: I slept with a woman I didn't know was married, her husband blamed it on her drinking."
"TIFU by forgetting to lock the bathroom door.


Oh boy how I wish this had happened at home. I'm sat on the shitter in one of my university's study spaces too embarrassed to leave. This just happened 5 minutes ago.


So me, being a man of somewhat regular bowel movements, stood up and headed for the toilet about ten minutes ago. Both of the unisex toilets were locked so I found myself a seat for a minute whilst I waited.

Not long after one became available and I headed in, only to find a lot of toilet roll all over the floor and the tap still running. Being the good sort I am, I tutted to myself, bent down and cleared away the paper and turned the tap off.

This is where I fucked up.

I then dropped trou, rotated through 180° and popped a squat. I happily dropped logs for a few minutes, browsing Reddit as I did so (I am a man of culture) and thinking to myself rather proudly that it was definitely one of the smelliest shits I've produced for a while (okay, not that cultured).

Unbeknownst to my forgetful self, I had totally failed to lock the door. Enter poor girl, who sees an unlocked door and heads right for it. The first I know is when the  handle creaks down and the door swings open.

For a good two seconds this girl stares at me and I stare back, neither of us really knowing what to do in such a situation, when the smell obviously hits her and she mumbles a quickfire apology and turns tail for the hills.

TL;DR forgot to lock the door of a public bathroom and accidentally introduced a fellow student to some interesting smells."
"TIFU: Update ! Asking about my parents divorce and found out I contributed.


TIFU: Update

This is an update from my TIFU post:
https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/cnnwuj/tifu_by_asking_about_my_parenta_divorce_and_found/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share

After careful consideration, numerous conversations and talking with my sister, u/goshdarnspiffy, I have decided to end communication with my mom. It's just not in my own best interest to keep in contact with her.

Besides the divorce and infidelity, there were years of mental and physical abuse both me and my sister endured due to the new dynamics that came as a result of the divorce, and my sister became my mother figure which put a lot of stress on both of us as well.

It has been a little over 5 years since I left my mom's house (I stayed with her my last two years of high school), and I have a child of my own now. I kept in contact with my mom solely out of pity because she has burned so many bridges, and I thought that seeing her grandson might help things. I wanted everything that happened to be water under the bridge. I reconnected in May of 2016 when my Nana passed a few months after I had my son.

I hoped she would change. She hasn't. I havent been close with her but I do talk to her every so often.

Now knowing she did the same thing to my Dad (much worse than me if we are being honest) and to my older sister, I dont think it is in me or my sons best interest to have any further communication.

I had an epiphany thanks to all of you. She was the example I needed in my life of who I dont want to be and my Dad is the example of who I want to be. I'm a single mom with an awesome little boy who's now three - his Dad abused me, beat me up twice and was sent to jail for it, twice. With my Dad's help, I was able to get away. He smelled his bullshit from a mile away but I continued to hang on because, as with my mom, I hoped he would change. Instead, I left and drove across the country never once looking back. My Dad let me and my son live with him until we got our own place.

TL;DR Yesterday I fucked up by learning I helped catch my mom cheating. This turned into learning more about my parents horrible marriage which uncovered years of abuse towards my dad that he never spoke up about.

Best Dad Ever!: https://m.imgur.com/gallery/5ZLAeMl

Goodbye, mom. Thanks for giving me life but you have proven you dont deserve to be in it anymore. I will forever be a Daddys girl."
"TIFU by blowing my horn at someone taking too long in the McDonald's drive-thru...


So yeah.. I'll make this quick: 

I was having a very busy day at work and I had to run an errand during my lunch break so I needed my trip to McDonald's to be a quick one (I don't know why I expected it to be quick). Anyway, guy in front of was taking FOREVER to order and it was pissing me off. So I hocked the horn at him... He proceeds to put his whole head out of the window and look back at me for like 15 seconds.. I swear, he was like a fucking giraffe. I just rolled my eyes at him and motioned for him to hurry the fuck up.

Well this is where the fun starts. I placed my order once he finally moved along. I get to the window to pay (this McD has two windows) and the girl says that the guy in front of me *paid for my order.* I started feeling guilty... I was like ""Damn, this guy just killed me with kindness"".

Nope. I get to the next window and the motherfucker took my food. I had to go without lunch today because I was impatient and pissed a giraffe off at McDonalds. 

tldr; I honked my horn at the wrong guy today. He paid for my food and then took it at the next window. I was left with no food."
