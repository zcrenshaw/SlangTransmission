"Can't believe the cake I ordered for Sunday can't be picked up on Monday when you're closed!


We run an ice cream shop. A big piece of our winter business is ice cream cakes, and we've got a pretty good reputation for making the best around. But it's still winter, and we're only open 5 days a week -- we close on Mondays and Tuesdays until the weather warms up a bit. Me is me. CL is crazy lady.

Customer fills out our online form to order a cake for her 6 year old daughter. Indicates that she wants to pick it up on Sunday. No problem, I reply to her via the email she supplied, and told her we'd have it ready on Sunday for her.

I come in to open up on Wednesday, and there's an angry voicemail from the woman, complaining that she came to pick up her cake on Monday afternoon, and SHE CAN'T BELIEVE WE'RE CLOSED! 

I call her up, and she absolutely chews me out. CL: Daughter's birthday is RUINED! We're the worst business she's ever dealt with, etc.  Typical crazy parent reaction.

When she calms down enough to  take a breath, I ask her ""If you needed the cake on Monday, why did you indicate that you'd pick it up on Sunday?"" 

CL: NO, I didn't! I KNOW what day my daughter's birthday is! It's YOUR fault for not telling me that you're closed on Monday!

OK, so I've got the email showing exactly what she ordered, and my email reply, where I stated ""We'll have it ready for you on Sunday""

Me: Did you get my email response?

CL: I don't read email!

Me: Well, we state on the form that we'll respond by email to confirm, and it says right here that you'll pick it up on Sunday at 2pm.

CL: (Changing her story now...) Well, I SAID Sunday, but just in case I decided to pick it up early. I really wanted to pick it up on Monday. AND YOU SHOULD HAVE TOLD ME THAT YOU'RE CLOSED ON MONDAY!

Me: So, I was supposed to realize that even though you SAID you'd pick it up on Sunday, you REALLY meant to pick it up on Monday, and I was to warn you about that?

CL: YES!

Me: OK, have a nice day! Click.

"Don't wanna pay $200 for your gas? Enjoy paying $8,000 for a new dock.


Kinda long; TLDR at the bottom

&amp;#x200B;

I worked at a small marina on a lake during the summer from when I was seventeen all the way until I graduated college and moved away. For the most part, it was the summer job every high school/college student dreams of. My boss was super laid back, most of my customers were super rich nice retirees that tipped well, and if there were no customers I could read, mess around on my phone, swim in the lake, etc. To this day it was the most enjoyable job I've ever had. For the most part my customers were in a good mood when they came to get gas for their boats. I can count the number of irate/bad customers that I've had over the course of six years on both of my hands. This customer is the only one that I had ever had that tried to get away without paying. It didn't end well for him.

&amp;#x200B;

So I was manning the marina by myself that day; it was still the off season (pre-Memorial Day) and we were only open on weekends. Most people were just starting to take their boats out of storage and business was super slow. It was nearing closing time, and I had a whopping total of three customers come by over the course of the day. Didn't make a lot in tips. I didn't really mind though, as I had brought along my DS and had spent the time playing Pokemon. I'm just about to head inside to start closing for the day when I see a boat speeding along to the dock. Now my boss' rule for taking customers at the end of the day was ""take them at your discretion"" which basically translated to ""take them if you want or turn them away I don't really care."" I had nothing better to do, so I decide to just stay open a little late and help this guy out. I got a little excited when I noticed that this guy (let's call him Mr. Mingy Moneybags, or Mr. MM) had a really fancy new wake boat. The people who own these things are usually filthy rich and tip well, as wake boats usually have monstrous gas tanks that can hold 30-60 gallons of gas (my car, for reference, holds about 15 gallons) and their bills are usually very high. 

&amp;#x200B;

Mr. MM pulls up to the dock and I helped moor his boat. I then start filling it up. I make myself comfy while I do this as Mr. MM said his boat takes 50 gallons and was almost empty, so it would take a while to fill it. This was back in 2013 when gas was still super pricey, and we only sold ethanol free gas so the price was just over $4.00 per gallon. Mr. MM complains to me about the price and I just shrug, saying that I'm not the one who decides what the prices are. He grows more and more agitated as the bill keeps climbing. I ask him if he's sure that he wants to fill up all the way. He just gives me a clipped ""yeah"" and continues to stare at the numbers ticking up on the pump. Finally, 47 gallons of gas later, Mr. MM's boat is filled and his bill comes out to just over $190 dollars. It was the most expensive bill I had ever seen up to that point. I turn to him and ask him how he's going to pay. He makes a show of patting his pockets and looking around his boat for a while. I just raise my eyebrows. He finally turns to me and says that he forgot his wallet. 

&amp;#x200B;

Now I have had people forget to bring money before. And I'm usually very understanding about it. What I'll usually do is hang onto something of theirs as collateral (usually a driver's license, sometimes their car keys or phone). I put it in the lockbox and wait for them to go home and grab their wallets. Pretty much everyone who owns a boat on this lake also lives on/near the lake, so it's never been an issue. Something that I ALSO did that I didn't tell the customers that I was doing was writing down their boat's tag number. If they didn't pay by the end of the day, I could give the tag number to security and the could pull up their boat registration, which had their name, address, the works. Up to this day I had never had to report a customer to security. 

&amp;#x200B;

When Mr. MM states that he doesn't have his wallet, I quickly glance at the tag on the side of his boat and jot down the numbers. I then address Mr. MM.

&amp;#x200B;

Me: Well sir, it's the end of the day, so if you could hurry home and get your wallet ASAP I would appreciate it. I'll also need something of yours to keep as collateral. 

Mr. MM: Oh that'll take too long. Do you have a phone on you?

Me: Yeah, in my purse

Mr. MM: If you could give me your phone I can call my wife, she can drive down here with my wallet in no time.

&amp;#x200B;

This answer satisfies me, so I turn to go into the building and grab my phone. While I'm doing this, I hear him turn his engine on. Not too unusual, so I keep going on my way. Then I hear a massive VROOOOM followed by a loud crunch. I whip around and see this guy speeding down the lake. He had pulled a runner on me. BUT because this man is apparently an idiot he also forgot to untie his boat from the dock completely. He got the rope off the cleat next to him but had apparently forgotten about the one tied to the back of his boat, which I had left some slack on. Now, normally the cleats on the boat would lose in this situation, or maybe the rope would snap, but our dock was a super old, crappy, splintery mess. So instead the cleat that was nailed into the dock got pulled completely free, along with an enormous chunk of wood. There was also a huge crack running down the length of the plank. This dumbass was now speeding down the lake with a piece of the dock dragging behind him. 

&amp;#x200B;

There's not really much I can do about Mr. MM now, so I go inside and radio security. I give them the tag number, along with a description of him and his boat. I also mention that he damaged the dock and owes almost $200 in gas. They thank me and say they'll get right on it. I then text my boss what happened and sent him a picture of the freshly ruined dock. He is PISSED and says Mr. MM better be prepared to fix it. I then go inside and finish closing for the day. I had to include a note to finance about why we were almost $200 short for the day and explained that security was working on it. 

&amp;#x200B;

The very next day my boss calls me. Security had gotten the police involved for theft and destruction of private property (the dock technically belonged to the neighborhood association). They got to him that very same day because of course they did, they had his address. Also, turns out the guy wasn't even married. He just told me that BS to get me to turn my back. The association threatened to press charges and bring the guy to court unless he agreed to the following terms:

&amp;#x200B;

1) He would pay what he owed for the gas

2) He would be banned from registering a boat on this lake (it was either for 10 or 15 years, I can't really remember)

3) He would pay to COMPLETELY REPLACE the dock he damaged

&amp;#x200B;

Mr. MM, apparently belonging to the ""throw money at problems to make them go away"" school of thought, or perhaps just realizing that if it went to court he would probably lose (the whole thing was caught on the security cameras), agreed to the terms without much of a fight. The marina was closed for 3 weeks while the dock was being rebuilt. I returned to work after that to admire our brand-spanking-new dock. The new dock's planks were composite instead of wood, and we got brand new pilings too. No more splinters! The new dock cost the guy nearly $8,000 dollars. To this day, I don't understand why a guy with so much money to throw around got so agitated about paying $200 for gas for a boat that must have cost him well over $60,000. 

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR: guys tries to run after refusing to pay his $200 gas bill, damages dock, has to pay $8,000 for a new one.

"Ok then, she’s seven.


This is really short, but it was really funny.

So I work at a VR place, and we have a bunch of games that people can play, our age requirement is 7, but some games like Superhot or Arizona Sunshine have a 13+ age restriction. 

This one day, a man comes in with his daughter, she didn’t look old enough, and I already knew she wasn’t gonna be able to play. They come looking around, and ask me what some of the games are. I give them my usual tour of the place, and what games we have, and the following conversation happens:

C = Customer, M = Me, D = Daughter

C: Ok, this is really cool. How old do you have to be, she’s 6 years old?

M: I’m sorry, but you have to be at least 7 to play any of the games here.

C: Ok then.. she’s 7.

M: Yeah, I’m sorry. I can’t let her play.

C: Ok, that’s fine then.

At this point, they turn away, and start leaving. The kid then looks up at her dad, and loudly says,

D: Daddy, Why did you say I was six? I’m five!!!

And my jaw just dropped, and I just started laughing."
"Complaining Shoplifter


I run a store that sells a mix of pop culture and adult items, as well as a lot of cheesy gag stuff (if you know what I mean...)

Having the adult items tends to attract the idiots who think it's perfectly okay to take what they want, because why not? This last weekend, I was doing my required closing shift, and it was a relatively quiet night. This couple comes in, a young guy and his girlfriend. I've seen them in the store before, and as far as I'd noticed, they were pretty mellow and okay. Turns out I was wrong...

I went into the back room to get something, the door to which is in the middle of the adult section. Something I'd overheard from the couple twigged my spidey-sense, so I stood at the door for a moment, listening. Sure enough, the guy was talking the girl into slipping a toy up her sleeve. We'd never know!

I sat down to watch the cameras, because yes, I have TWO cameras on that section alone. I watched her pick out her toy (the appropriately-named ""Wallbanger"") and they started wandering the store with it. I went back out to the floor, and kept them in sight. At one point, some kids knocked some items off of a display, and they helped me clean it up. Then they wandered back to the opposite corner of the store, and sure enough, the toy went up her sleeve.

I went back to the front of the store, and as they were walking out the door, I stopped them.

""Hey, where did you put that toy you picked out?""

""I put it back.""

""Actually, I've been watching you, and you haven't been back to that corner since you picked it off the wall. Can you show me where you left it, please?""

She walked in, the boyfriend trailing behind us both. I give him credit for not bailing out and leaving her behind, at least. As she walked through the store, I could see her trying to discreetly slip the box out of her sleeve. She got it out just as she got to the other corner, and handed me an opened box. The Wallbanger was still in the box, thankfully.

""Great. Thanks for that. By the way...you and your boyfriend are now banned from the store. I don't want to see you here again.""

""What? Why?""

""I watched you put the toy up your sleeve, you left the store with it. I could have you arrested for shoplifting. Be glad I'm just banning you and your boyfriend. Now please leave.""

I followed them to the door, and as they walked out, I spoke one more time.

""By the way, the next time you decide to try to steal from a store? Don't talk about it in the store.""

They both paled, then turned and walked away.

NOT THE END.

The next morning, I'm opening, and the phone rings. I'm not fully awake, and I don't answer the phone with my name like I normally do. The voice on the other end asks for a manager, which wakes me up. I identify myself, and the girl launches into a complaint about the guy who accused her of putting a sex toy up her sleeve and banned her from the store for no reason the night before.

""Yeah...that was me. I was the manager last night. You're still banned.""

Five seconds of complete silence, then a soft click as she disconnected the call."
"Customer didn't understand how to try on shoes??????


So yesterday I noticed this woman was standing with a TON of single shoes around her. I walked up and asked if she needed help, which she said she did. Then I asked her why she only had left shoes. Apparently, she thought she wasn't allowed to take the box of shoes corresponding to her shoe size in order to try both on. So, she was pulling the left shoe from the box and putting the box back on the shelf.

I explained and then insisted that she just take the box and try on both, as it makes life easier for both of us. I grabbed a box and watched her struggle to put the shoe on while standing. I told her she could feel free to sit down, as that would make it easier. She said she couldn't find a single place to sit in the whole store. Now we literally have so many benches, that our Regional Manager is always telling us to throw a few out. I pointed behind this woman and told her she was welcome to sit there.

She didn't seem to understand why she was allowed to sit on the benches we have everywhere. I just don't get our customers sometimes...."
"Customer tries to get a free phone repair, but ends up looking like an idiot instead


Technically my coworker’s story, but sharing it for him. I’m on mobile, so sorry for formatting. 

So I work for a company that repairs cell phones, and we have a very reasonable price for replacing screens that have been broken (think well under $50). If there’s no physical damage present, then failing parts are replaced for free. Pretty nice and customers are usually pretty happy with this.

Lady walks in, nose in the air, and asks how long it would take to repair her phone, because the LCD is no longer responsive. Coworker takes the phone and sure enough, there’s a few cracks here and there and lines going through the screen. CW = Coworker, L = Lady. 

CW: Ah, yeah I definitely see where the phone may be having issues! We could certainly fix this for you, but because of the cracks in the screen, it would be the [small repair fee]...

L: *in a suuuuper whiny, pretentious voice* No. It won’t. Because I’ve brought it here to be repaired before and [Company] waived the fee! I’ve been a customer just soooooo loooonnnggg!

CW: Ah... okay... well unfortunately I don’t have a way to do that for you in my syst—

L: *cuts him off* Do you have the parts?

CW: Uh, yes, I should have those in sto—

L: *cuts him off again* NO. DO YOU HAVE THEM. Yes or no??

CW: *turns to look in our parts drawer and ignoring the sass* Let me look for you ma’am! 

L: Yeah, I’m not paying for it. I didn’t have to before and I won’t now. I’ll call them. I’ll call [company] because I KNOW they’ll waive it for me! I know they will! 

CW: *walks back from checking our parts* Yep, so I do have those parts, I could do that repair for you today if you’d like...

L: *already holding her phone up to her ear, and acting like she somehow magically is connected within seconds to whomever she thinks waives these type of things. She looks at my coworker super annoyed like he’s interrupting her* NO. You’re not going to TOUCH it until I have a chance to tell them what’s happening. Because I knoowww they’re going to waive it for me!

CW: Okay ma’am... No problem... Just let me know what they say...

At this point, L walks over and sits in one of our waiting chairs near our work station, and proceeds to “talk to someone” on the phone... She makes a big show of saying and spelling her last name, rummaging through her purse, and overall making a scene about being on the phone with some kind of customer service. 

What she DIDN’T realize, was that we could plainly see her screen from where we were sitting, and she was most definitely not on the phone with anyone... Not only that, but she kept accidentally turning on her phone’s flashlight (not typically an issue when you’re actually on a call..) and she had an ACTUAL phone call come through (phone started audibly ringing) while she was pretending to be speaking to someone. Of course she makes this big show of “Oh! Oh I’m going to have to put you on hold!” while she randomly presses on her screen... 

L: *after literally being “on the phone” for maybe 3 minutes* OKAYY! They’ve waived it! 

No, lady. No they have not. "
