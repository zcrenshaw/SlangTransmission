"If you’re under 18, get off Grindr and Tinder


Don’t be naive, it’s not for you and you’re not ready for it. Enjoy being a mindless teenager for a bit longer, don’t be exposed to the toxicity of the gay community, all the scum will still be there when it comes time. 

Also nobody likes jailbait. 

Edit: This isn’t a question I just needed to put this out there! "
"How did you tell your bf about an unconventional thing you like in bed?


This probably sounds crazy but I love guys laugh, I can't stop thinking about tying up my bf and teasing/tickling him. It's been three months since we got together and I still can't work up the nerve to talk about it"
"I remember when I first found out my uncle was gay.


We were staying at his house, and I found out that him and his roommate were lovers. My reaction was homophobic in the literal sense; even though I'd never said a bad word about gay people despite being a high schooler, I was literally afraid of them. I remember my parents giving me the ""that's their lifestyle choice, it's not what *we*(we including me and my siblings, of course) believe"". I remember at one point my mother said ""It was very hard for your father growing up, having a brother like that"".

Now I'm bi and feel fairly ashamed at how I felt that night, though even then I could see that what my mother said there was total horseshit. As if I should feel bad for my father rather than my uncle, who had to deal with being gay in such an ultra-conservative family. Still gets me worked up thinking about it."
"Tips for Deepthroat


Last night I went to hookup with this younger white boy with a huge dick. He was a shower &amp; a grower. His cock had some girth to it as well. Well before hand he was telling me that he likes to throat fuck, &amp; I enjoy being throat fucked. It’s hot &amp; it turns me on. 

My problem is that I can’t handle it. When I’m in control &amp; sucking dick i like to think that I’m pretty good. Like I can have their dick hit the back of my throat with no problem but I guess it’s because I’m in control &amp; my mind is telling my body that I want it so bad. But when this guy was fucking my mouth I kept on gagging when he would get close to the back of my throat. So I was a little embarrassed but he seemed not to mind me having to stop and catch my breath. I don’t wanna be a bitch when it comes to that. I would like to be able to please the guy I’m with if he so chooses that he wants to do that. 

So just wanted to see if anyone had some tips that would help me out when it came to deepthroating &amp; being throat fucked..."
"Be Easy on the Straight Crush Questions


When I was 18-20 I fell for my straight best friend and it was terrible. It was my first time having feels so strong for anyone that I didn't understand how to act. You start looking into every little thing that the straight crush does and hope that even a piece of him feels the same way back. I reached out to the only people I knew that I could talk to and asked them all of the seemingly dumb questions that you find on this forum. When I see these questions asked here it reminds me of that time when I was first understanding what it meant to have feeling for a man. This is just a very common part of understanding who you are and your sexuality. 

Can we show a little more compassion for these guys instead of putting them down just for reaching out? Yes, I get there's a ton of them and yes I get it's often times the same things over and over but just ignore them if you see one of these posts and let the people who want to actually help, help. 

An old gay friend of mine once told me that falling in love with a straight man is just the gay right of passage. You learn from it and it helps you discover what qualities you want in a future boyfriend. "
"I'm scared of my mother dying without grandkids


Previous background to this: I come from a very homophobic country, and my dad is dead.

Nowadays, I'm just terrified of my parents dying. My dad died early, and while my mom is fit, I'm just terrified of it happening. I'm also just about reaching the age where you're accepted to marry.

I can't come out, it'd break her heart, and it's seen as a source of shame in my home country. I know a Pakistani here in Europe who I know who's shunned by all Pakistanis here, and is now in another country. It's not an option.

And I have no idea how I can spend my life without my mother, she's everything to me, but I know she can't accept this part of me, and I've tried to not be gay, but it's just not possible.

Not even sure why I'm making this thread, it's just venting at this point, and I know no advice can fix this issue, but I'm just pissed. Why do we have to choose between family and romantic love?"
"I want to go to the gym but I’m too nervous


I want to go to the gym but I’m too nervous. I’m scared People are going to look at me and judge me. Is there a way to get over this fear? I really want to start to get in shape and lose weight!"
"6 Annoying Types of Guys You Encounter on Grindr



1. **Guys who haven’t read your profile.** The functionally illiterate. Your profile says you’re looking for Chats + Friends. Mine says I’m looking for ass. Why are we talking again? 


2. **Guys who send dick or asshole pics (depending on whether you’re a top or bottom) as a first message.** You knew this was coming. I appreciate nudes as much as the next guy, but for some reason the only guys who open a convo like this are elderly men with sad bodies. Never open Grindr while you’re eating. 


3. **Guys who don’t know what they’re looking for.** These are the lost puppies of the dating scene, and are by far the most annoying gents on the app. In conversation they are vague and nonspecific about what they’re looking for. They are only on Grindr out of boredom and loneliness but intrinsically have nothing of substance to offer a potential partner. I’ve learned to end convos with these guys early. Even if you do schedule something with them they have the highest probability of flaking.


4. **Social media “influencers”.** These attention whores are easy to spot in that they have next to nothing in their profile except links to their numerous social media accounts. They are only on Grindr out of their insatiable need for external validation, not because they’re serious about meeting someone. They haven’t been laid in years because they’re too busy taking mirror selfies and curating them on Instagram. 


5. **Bots**. Gotcha — these aren’t guys at all. But they do offer the best pick up lines so they’re not so bad. 


6. **Guys who can’t take a hint.** Persistence pays off in most areas of life, but to say these guys are persistent would be to mistake their refusal to take the hint after you’ve already ignored all 50 messages they’ve sent you over a period of months as a positive trait instead of online harassment. I used to just block these guys but a lot of them will create a new account and continue the harassment. Telling them to fuck off works a little better. 

Any questions, class? Additions or subtractions? "
"Me and my fiancé ended things because of my sexuality.


I don’t know where else to go with this but here it is. I was a straight man. Kinda. I had all these feelings that I had pushed down my entire life, and recently it started coming up. I fell in love with a woman, proposed to her, and wanted a life with her. But then the feelings I’ve been pushing down started coming up and started getting stronger and stronger...and then I started to realize I would never be able to be myself unless I had explored that side of myself. Maybe I wasn’t ready to get married and it was unfair of me to propose to her without knowing myself completely...I don’t know. It hurts me so much to end things with her because of this and I can’t stop thinking and wishing that I wasn’t the way I am so I wouldn’t feel this way...I just want to be completely straight so I can be with her and feel like Myself...I guess there’s not really a question here I just needed to talk to some people that could maybe say something to make it better "
"My gay brother found my butt plugs &amp; jock straps


My brother (23) was in my room and just started going through my stuff in like a joking matter and eventually he gets to the drawer where I know my things are hidden. Obviously I tell him to stop and literally push him out of the way but he just gets angry and opens the drawer and finds them. He then looks at me and starts this fake disappointed cry and shakes his head. I just laugh it off because I’m not going to make a big deal about it. He starts calling me disgusting for doing that and then he says “I know you do stuff with other people.” I say yes I do, I’m 18. My brother knows I’m gay and did not digest it well when I told him. I’m paranoid he will tell my parents. Why is he so interested in my life? "
"Sexual incompatibility sucks. We are both bottoms!


He has been great so far but the sex is non existent aside from oral. He said he's a vers bottom but in practice he isn't because he can't keep it up. I tried topping him but there's no enjoyment for me when doing it. I like seeing him turned on but the sex sucks or maybe we are not creative enough. We tried dildos but we want the real thing. Anyone who experienced the same thing?"
"Have a mature guy suck me regularly. Any thoughts?


So I'm thinking of looking for a mature guy, 40s or so to see if he can blow me on a regular-enough basis. Had this fantasy for a while but been kind of ashamed and nervous about it, just he walks in, I drop my pants and that's the show.

Any other guys done this been on either side of something like this Is it common? How was it?"
"What is your and your partners ‘cut’ and ‘uncut’ status.


Are you and your partner both cut or uncut or is one cut and one uncut.  Do you have any preferences? Do you like yours and your partners status? For couples that one is cut and one is uncut, does this add any excitement in the bedroom? "
"I just want a boyfriend


I don’t want to be gay or anything, and I don’t want to have to go to gay bars or hookup apps. 
I just want a guy to give me a hug.  
None of this is remotely possible. "
"Why don’t I have friends


I’m a nice person. I don’t smell, I’m not (that ugly), and I’m not annoying. 

I have this obnoxious roommate who is annoying but he has so many friends, I don’t get it."
"Where to look to find someone to cuddle with?


I really don’t want any hook ups right now.   But I’m incredibly lonely with winter here.   Is it realistic at all to find somebody to cuddle with?  Without sex?   

"
"Ever been especially horny during the exams?


Here's the thing: I'm getting my second masters 5 years after getting my first one. I already have f'ed up one of the exams (intermediate economics is tough), got one A, one B, and in two days comes the most important one (customers protection). If I fail this one, I'm definitely being expelled and then having to go back to homeland (which is Russia, and it's.... not too cool). I have a feeling that I'll pass this one, and the studying is actually going well, but I feel horny like a 16 yo.

What the hell is that? Shouldn't I be worried instead? And what do I do to keep from spending hours on Grindr, Scruff, Tinder, Hornet, and PlanetRomeo. Also, masturbating makes me sleepy instantly.

&amp;#x200B;

Also, hi, that's my first post here :)"
"My boyfriend broke up with me last night, and told me something that hit me like a ton of bricks.


For starters, I'm overweight. Too overweight. Not a comfortable or cute amount of chub, but not the 600 pound life people on TLC either. Right in the middle. I'm just luckily pretty tall so it's less noticeable.

The boyfriend had always pushed me to stay active and lose weight (in a good way) but I think he got of waiting. He told me he didn't want to continue with the relationship anymore, that I felt like an anchor to him and he thought he and I just couldn't work anymore. The thing that brought me to tears afterwards though, was what he ended the call with. 

He told me, ""You would be worth it if you'd actually try.""

I've struggled with weight loss for a while. I binge, I eat because stuff taste good not because I need it, etc. I had lost about 80 pounds then when I went on vacation gained 15 and slowly crept back up the point I've gained 40 back. I was on my way and I just started half assing and not really caring anymore. 

I want to try this time guys. My goal is lose 100 pounds by the end of the year, or at least close to that. Maybe then I'll have a chance to get back together with the man I love. 

I guess what I want to ask, have you guys ever been in a similar situation? How did you stop your bad habits and get *seriously* on track with good ones? "
