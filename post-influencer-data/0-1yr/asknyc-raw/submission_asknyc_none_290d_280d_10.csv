What are some signs that you might be getting mugged. A homeless guy at the subway station asked me what time it was, and I told him I didn't have a watch. He got really mad and kept talking to himself. Luckily, there were 2 police officers on the platform so he didn't do anything. 

&amp;#x200B;

Also,last night/this morning, I was waiting outside the subway for an uber, and a guy asked me if I had some money to help the homeless. I said I didn't, he then commented on how nice my coat was and asked if it was cashmere. I paused and ran back into the train station. I really hated that I ran away.

&amp;#x200B;

What are some tips to avoid these encounters or to be prepared in the future?"
1,"Buying a 2 family house in NYC to share with parents


I grew up in NYC with immigrant parents who didn't make a lot of money, and they are still renting a place today even though they are around retirement age.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm in my mid-20s and make over 200k/yr (software engineer). At this point in my life, conventional wisdom might indicate that I should rent a place in Manhattan or in ""cool"" areas of Brooklyn or Queens - that allows me to be closer to restaurants and activities, gives me flexibility to move around (it's not abnormal for software engineers to change jobs every few years), and prevents me from being house poor.

&amp;#x200B;

With that said, home ownership has always been a goal for my parents, and I've been thinking about purchasing a home sometime in the next few years. Here are some thoughts / details:

* I don't mind staying in NYC long term
* I'm not in a relationship, but I need to think about my financial situation if I start a family in the distant future.
* Two single family homes (one for me, one for my parents) is significantly more expensive than buying one 2-family home and sharing half of it with my parents. I'm thinking 750k \* 2 = 1.5M for two single family homes, and 1M for a 2-family home.
* My parents do not drive, so many areas of NJ, Long Island, and Hudson Valley are out of consideration
* While I anticipate changing jobs multiple times over the next 3 decades or so, most job opportunities are in Manhattan or nearby (e.g. Amazon's planned offices in Long Island City). I'd like to keep my commute under an hour.

&amp;#x200B;

With the details above, I think it makes the most sense for me to look for a 2 family house, $1M or under, in the outer boroughs or Brooklyn or Queens. 

&amp;#x200B;

I just wanted to post this to hear any thoughts Reddit has. Since NYC has a sizable immigrant population, I'm curious if anyone has gone through a similar situation. Is it stupid for me to consider taking on so much mortgage debt when I am still fairly young? Should I purchase a house when I have no idea when or with whom I'll have my own family? Assuming 20% down, is 200k/yr enough for an 800k mortgage?"
2,"Manhattan restaurants and bars that sell cool t-shirts?


My brother is into this sort of thing and I want to find a cool t-shirt with a funny saying on it to give him for Christmas. Shouldn't be super touristy. I live in the city and ideally it would be some cool bar I hang out at, but I don't go anywhere cool!"
3,"Is it legal for a 10 year old child to putting on a drag show at 3AM in a gay bar?


The child is apparently a “professional” performer. They put on a drag show - dancing to music etc - fully clothed but working for money and taking tips. At one point it crawled on its hands and knees for it. The parents were present. The child didn’t consume any alcohol as far as I can tell.

Surely this is illegal for one reason or another, along with being ethically reprehensible?"
