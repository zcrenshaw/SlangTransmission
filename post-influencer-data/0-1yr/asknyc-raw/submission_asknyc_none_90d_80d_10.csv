WE CAN'T HELP YOU WITH SWAMP ASS, BUT WE CAN TELL YOU HOW TO MAKE IT SLIGHTLY BETTER.


SUMMER IN NYC is one of the BEST times around. From chicks in sundresses, men in hot pants, and generally everyone looking sexy in sunglasses. Here's our guide to keep your cool in the concrete jungle

#Commuting in the heat

There is a certain give and take you've just got to accept during the summers. You can only do so much to make sure you don't stink, but on the other hand -- everyone else is sweating just as much as you.

Here's the local lowdown.

-

&gt; 
&gt; * Prescriptions Strength anti antiperspirants
&gt; * Sweat rag
&gt; * Extra shirt

&gt; 
&gt; - take a colder shower than normal. Taking a warm shower increases your body temp in the morning. Also pat dry instead of rub dry as that also increases temperature.
&gt; 
&gt; - leave 15 min earlier so you’re not rushing and increasing your temp running to the train
&gt; 
&gt; - get a hat that absorbs and wicks sweat. I sweat mostly from my head and this helps a lot
&gt;

-
&gt; Blotting papers and airy, light clothing. In times of desperation, I sneakily reapply all my makeup at the closest Sephora using testers.

- Baby wipes, make up wipes, facial wipes!

-

&gt; 
&gt; * Buy TALCOM POWDER aka Baby Powder
&gt; 
&gt; * Put that shit under your pits after applying antiperspirant deodorant and of course, if you're a guy, a quick coat on your sack
&gt; 
&gt; * Carry mini deodorant from any pharmacy and a small bottle of baby powder

/u/callmedave1

- Try switching to a totebag instead of a backpack to avoid backsweat

- Be vigilant about [HOT CARS](https://gothamist.com/2018/07/11/subway_hot_car_mta_complaint.php)  Still mostly on the 4/5/6 and 1 lines!

- Don't be stupid, stupid. Change at the office if possible!

- Drop the New Yorker dress code, black attracts heat. Try other materials such as linen.

- Grab a portable fan or parisol

- DO YOU REALLY NEED TO RUSH? Slow down to avoid speed heats

I sweat a lot and I don’t know how to avoid looking like I just worked out."
3,"How did New York manage to become one of the safest major cities in the country?


Asking because crime rate here in general is lower than most other places in the US. Also, kinda pointed out by the recent poster from Chicago who asked why we’re so willing to use our devices in public"
4,"I'm getting harassed in my Bushwick neighborhood. Does anyone have a legal self-defense tool to recommend that won't get me arrested?


There are groups of guys who live on my street and stand around in groups on the sidewalk. I can't avoid them. Most of the time if they notice me it's just lip-smacking or saying whatever they feel like. But occasionally one of them will get up, block my path, and continue blocking me while I try to get around him. It's fucking aggravating and I don't want to deal with it anymore. 

I have a [cat keychain](https://www.wildfang.com/pub/media/catalog/product/cache/image/966x543/af097278c5db4767b0fe9bb92fe21690/3/_/3_BR6IKpW8vuZG2XGQSxz6ZyCtrmUwcuxn-1.jpg) but from what I can tell it's illegal to carry those here. Holding my keys in my knuckles isn't that effective and it's hard to maintain. Any suggestions?"
