1,"2 month gap in lease, do I have to pay rent?


My lease ended on Dec 5th. I was sent a renewal lease on Nov. 15th. 

Because I wasn't served with a renewal at least 90 days ahead of time, my new lease term starts March 1st 2019. 

From now until March 1st, do I technically have a lease? Do I pay my same rent in the interim? Do I have to pay rent at all?

Full quote from renewal letter:

&gt;Your current renewal lease expires on December 5, 2018. Pursuant to the Rent Stabilization Code, when an owner fails to timely serve a renewal lease 90 - 150 days prior to the expiration of a tenant's lease term, the new lease term will start on the first rent payment date occurring no less than 90 days after the date that the owner does offer the lease to the tenant. Because you were not properly served with a renewal lease, your new lease term will start on March 1, 2019

2,"Looking for cocktail bars, breweries, and places to eat. I checked the side bar and it was not helpful


Looking for cocktail bars, breweries, and places to eat. I checked the side bar and it  was not helpful. As far as cocktail bars I’ve been to seamstress on the upper east side which is now closed, Henry nomad at the life hotel, so now I’m looking for other places to get good and unique cocktails. As far as breweries I haven’t been to any yet and would like suggestions on the best ones. I am into sour and iPas. As far as food looking for good brew pub style food, ale houses or bars with good unique foods like appetizers and sandwiches, places that serve HOT food like spicy and I love a good homemade hot sauce. Pizza of course. And maybe something fancy to take the girlfriend too. A good place with a variety on the menu but offers good steak and such. "
