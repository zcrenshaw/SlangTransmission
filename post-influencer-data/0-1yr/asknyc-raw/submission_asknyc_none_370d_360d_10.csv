1,"Have you heard of this scam?


I was hanging out of a restaurant today in the UWS waiting for a friend when a van pulled up. The driver was a man who was dressed very nice and claimed to be a millionaire from Dubai. He had a few kids in the car, and said he lost his wallet with all his cash and credit cards, and he wanted to borrow a ""few hundred dollars"" so he could get to Florida (I think...I couldn't fully understand what the excuse was). The van was a rental with Florida plates. He kept saying he was Muslim and that he would pay me back double and was trying to give me his gold jewelry as an act of good faith. It sounded way too insane and I just told him, ""Nah sorry man this is New York sounds real fishy."" Eventually he got irritated with me and drove off."
2,"Very annoying autistic neighbor. What to do?


Greetings fellow New Yorkers. So me and generally all of the neighbors in my neighborhood are annoyed with one particular person. Whom harasses everyone in the neighborhood by aggressively saying hello and will stalk you for miles if you ignore him. The thing is he isnt dangerous but he is dreadfully annoying to the point that people have threatened violence against him but obviously no one is going to attack an autistic person. He's been told to stay away and he also harasses and stalks all the young women in the neighborhood. I am lost as to what to do for the continual daily harrassment and stalking by this autistic person. It's a quality of life issue.

He has gone as far as to block people's driveway until you say hello to him. He's followed people several miles on his bicycle chasing cars. I know it sounds silly but everyone is genuinely annoyed by this individual."
3,"What do you do for fun on the weekends that doesn’t involve alcohol?


I just turned 30 and to be honest most weekends in my 20s feel like a blur. I was having a quiet night out with a few friends and we said “HEY. Let’s finally do something that doesn’t involve one drop of alcohol or a trip to a bar!” And yet all our ideas really sucked. To the non-degenerates of NYC, what do you do with your friends that doesn’t involve going out to bars or smoking anything on a regular basis?"
