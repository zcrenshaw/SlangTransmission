0,"Abortion clinic/experience?


Hi all. 

Serious replies only. Please no hate/judgment. I'm currently a high risk pregnancy (as per my OB) and it's affecting my health greatly. My OB does not perform abortions and I've made my decision to protect my health.

I've been having a hard time choosing an abortion clinic so I'm wondering what clinic did you attend and what was your experience like?

Thanks for your input."

Blue Greek coffee take-out cups, good bagels, B &amp; H photo... apparently they don’t have those elsewhere. 

Is there anything else you thought was common everywhere that we seem to only get here?"
