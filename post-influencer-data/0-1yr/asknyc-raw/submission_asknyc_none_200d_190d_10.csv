0,"Please share your end of the day food discounts.


Been noticing the Duane Reade by me has 50 percent off on their cookies and salads that haven’t sold by the end of the day. 

It’s been amazing for me to grab one for lunch the next day. 

I know Au Bon Pain has end of the day sales in their cookies. They pretty much let you load up for two bucks. 

I’m craving more discounted end of the deal foods. 

Anybody else been talking advantage of this “loophole” "
1,"Non-native New Yorkers, what is the best change you’ve noticed in yourself since living here?


For example, probably a common example, I was pretty quiet and passive when I arrived about 10 years ago and learned quickly that I needed to be direct, quickly speak or respond and be a little loud (but not rude or pushy like the outsider stereotype of New Yorkers), especially when at work or talking to people I don’t know. I’m still a reserved guy but I understand how to get to the point ASAP now as just a way of life. I find this assertive and alert mode not only helps me here but that it’s helpful in other places too, and I likely wouldn’t have learned it had I not moved here. What’s your example?"

There's an election on for Public Advocate in case you haven't looked in your mailbox lately."
3,"How can I make these boiler pipes stfu so I don’t end up shooting myself in the face?


Since about 5 in the fucking morning, it has sounded like someone has been hitting the pipe connected to the boiler that runs through my apartment with a hammer every second. It will sometimes stop for about 15 seconds, just enough time for me to remember what not being on the brink of insanity feels like, then start up again. Is there anyway to stop this living hell? Thanks. "
