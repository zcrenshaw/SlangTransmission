1,"Where should I go to meet guys into educated black women?


I've been in the area for the better part of a year. I'm in my early 20s, have a good job, and I'm in grad school full time while I work full time. I'm pretty busy but I have time for dating, just have yet to meet anyone. 

&amp;#x200B;

I don't know where to meet single black men and I don't know where to meet men of other races who are open to getting to know me beyond a friendship. I can't say my personality is perfect, but I literally do not meet single guys enough that it could possibly be my personality that turns them off. I'm just looking for spots to hang out or activities to do that will help me meet people with an open mind. 

&amp;#x200B;

Before anyone says it's 2019 and this isn't a thing, I've had men say that they're not intersted in getting set up with me solely based on my race. I had this issue when I lived in a less diverse area and thought it would be easier here, but it's not. I'm fairly certain I'm not putting myself out there enough or that I'm putting myself in the wrong places to meet the kind of men I'd vibe with. 

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR I don't know how to meet people in NYC, PLEASE help me. "
