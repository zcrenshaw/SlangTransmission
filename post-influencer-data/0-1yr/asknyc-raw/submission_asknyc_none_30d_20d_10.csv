0,"Anyone else here bottom of the barrel?


Living in the projects, delis and tight knit circles are how we all float by. Sometimes it's kinda jarring when people talk about $50K+ a year not being enough to live here at all, or the projects being some kind of hellscape. Postmates is how I eat and honestly I'm good.

Anyone else here living that life? How much do y'all make anyway?"
1,"Amicably ending a 10+ year relationship, need a fresh start. Any ideas where to start for guy in his mid 30's trying to establish a social circle in NYC?


As the title suggests, going through a bit of a rough patch, my marriage is ending just from simply falling out of love and going through the motions for the last few years. 

We moved to NYC about 3 years ago and during that time I've really just focused on working and coming home to my wife. We have a small social circle here, but all through her because I'm from Europe and don't know anybody, I haven't really developed a social circle in that time and whilst a part of me is excited to begin a new life, I'm also terrified of how difficult it will be being so alone.

I'm currently looking at apartments with room mates, so at least I wont be completely alone in the evenings, although I'm not holding out for any friendships to blossom from living arrangements, so I'm just curious, how should I go about establishing some friends? 

Ideally I'd like to get to know some male friends, around the same age (I'm 36), maybe even similar situation, I don't like to use the word ""wing man"", but it would be nice if someone else was also trying to build a life in NYC and needed a friend to have someone to talk to, go to events with and meet new people.

I suppose this post is half looking for advice, half hoping to strike up a conversation with like minded person(s).

I'm just a regular guy, a little bit lonely, a little bit scared. Lol, would love some advice or people who are in the same boat to talk to.

Thanks!"
2,"Desperate for Help


I'm on the verge of homelessness, and I'm low on options.

I've been applying to jobs and currently working postmates to feed myself, but I'm not making much because I'm delivering by foot. I just need immediate work. If I can immediately start working and earn money, I can hopefully turn this situation around.

If anyone has any advice, I'll be really grateful"
3,"Do waiters get upset with solo diners?


I see so many nice restaurants and varieties of different cuisines all over that I’d love to try them out. However, I have a fear of dining alone. I’m afraid of wait staff thinking I’m not worth their time. 

I’m a big tipper. I always tip 20% the very least, with way more than that for mediocre service if you serve with a smile and acknowledge my existence. I’m a 26 year old Bangladeshi guy with no friends but a love for food. I have money to spend but no confidence. 

My fear is that a table with 2 people at the very least would have a tab twice as much as mine hence twice the tip for the waiter. If my bill is $50, with 20% tip being $10, why would the wait staff want to serve me as opposed to a prospective family of 4 with a $150 and larger tip? I’m just wasting a table at that point. I don’t look like I’m wealthy either to leave a good tip either so I feel like nobody would want to serve my table on a busy weekend night. 

Anyway, that’s just my fear that I’m potentially wasting someone else’s time. So do waiters get upset with solo diners because the bill is smaller compared to bigger tables? Or am I being completely irrational and should go for a steak dinner tonight?"
