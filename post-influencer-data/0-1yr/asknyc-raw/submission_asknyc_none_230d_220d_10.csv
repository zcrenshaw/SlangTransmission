0,"Reasonable place to get skis tuned?


Anyone have a shop they like &amp; trust? I know a good place in NJ but won’t be heading back that way for a while, so I thought I’d see if any of you have a Long Island or Westchester recommendation. 

Just searching for some cheap prices and good service. 

Thanks!"
1,"Is it supposed to be dangerously code tomorrow or something?


I've been hearing murmurings but all I see is a gale warning and not that bad of temperatures...am I missing something?

Edit: JK I found out the gale warning is for 40MPH winds and a low of 4 degrees."
2,"I changed my address at the DMV... where else do I need to update my address for state and city governments?

3,"Best truck/van rental?


I'm moving from Astoria to Crown Heights and will need a truck or van to move my pretty limited stuff. 

What's the best option? U-Haul seems like it will be around $80 ($35 for the rental and then $1.59 per mile). I would have to drop it off back in Astoria or it would be more than double the price. Annoying, but whatever.

Are there any other companies I should look at? Everything else looks more expensive."
