**WIP**"
1,"what do you do about harassment in nyc?


so i’m 5’5”, 22 years old and weigh 115 lbs soaking wet. i’m black + guyanese, which is probably relevant to this story. the J is my normal line to and from home and today i was heading into the city. a white woman who looks to be in her 20s is seated across from me. we both have our headphones in, minding our own business on a wednesday afternoon. a large black man in a suit (must’ve been about 6’2”, not overweight but very physically intimidating) walks past us to the other train car, then walks back, looks at me dead in the eye and moves closer. he then sits right in front of me next to the white girl. i move to the other side of the car because he’s making me uncomfortable, like i normally do in these situations. a few minutes later the white girl moves to my side of the car and sits across from me. i look over and the man appears to be ranting about something, so i look at her and smile like “LOL new york right?” i then pause my music and it’s apparent that he’s speaking very angrily about slavery and how white women are bitches etc etc. then he says “i can’t believe she walked away, i’m going to get up and come over there and what’s she going to do about it?” and he DOES. he walks over and stands over me and goes “you stupid anorexic bitch, ain’t nobody worried about you and you moved your seat. you need to get some implants and stop popping pills” and then he turns to the white girl and starts berating her, talking about gentrification and donald trump or god knows what (like she’s responsible for any of that just because she’s white). she starts crying and i think she tried to call her boyfriend because he goes “i see you crying bitch, go ahead and call justin, i’ll fuck him up too” just saying the most awful vile shit. then he looks back at the men on the train and goes “i WISH someone would be a hero right now, i’ve got five stops, i’ll beat you all the fuck up” so of course nobody does anything, not that i blame them. this guy was really scary. i move to the other side of the car once his back is turned and he’s still going in on the white woman once the doors open at essex and i sprint off. i’m still shaking and i just wish there was something i could DO. i feel guilty for abandoning her but i feel like if i said something to him the situation only would have escalated, potentially physically. i kept my head down in silence the entire time. 

this is the second instance of severe verbal harassment and intimidation i’ve encountered in less than a month. i’m from long island but i’ve lived in the city for almost four years and i’ve never really experienced something to this degree. am i overreacting for being concerned? should i just suck it up and move on? what would you have done in this situation? because it’s not like you can call the police or pull the emergency brake or something. i don’t know. i love new york but situations like this make me feel really helpless. ☹️ 

tl;dr was cornered and verbally intimidated on the subway this afternoon - what would you do in this situation?"

3,"What are the best luxury experiences in NY?


I've been thinking about Aire Ancient Baths, and some of the crazy restaurants we have here than can cost $700/pp including booze. So what are some of the other things available in this city?

I'm thinking in terms of either experiences or bespoke things that are made in this city.

Toss budget out the window. I'm not doing this shit. I'm just curious."
