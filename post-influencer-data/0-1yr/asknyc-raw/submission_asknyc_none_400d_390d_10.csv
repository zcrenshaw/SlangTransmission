1,"And advise for a Hasidic guy trying to interact with more people?


Hi fellow New Yorkers. 

As the title suggests, I’m an Hasidic guy deep embedded within the community. I’ve been active recently on Reddit and I really enjoy interacting with all kinds of  people outside my community. I really want to meet new people and step outside my box. But it’s really difficult due my background and upbringing, I can feel almost frightened to speak to strangers. I think I’m kind of taking a long shot here,  but if anyone has any tips or ideas how go ahead about it I would really appreciated.

3,"For those who don't live in NYC: why are you subscribed to /r/askNYC?


Not judging or anything, just genuinely curious the reasons why people are subbed here while not living here. I'll see comments in threads sometimes mentioning, ""yeah, I've lived in the midwest my entire life"" and I find that interesting, would love to know more"
