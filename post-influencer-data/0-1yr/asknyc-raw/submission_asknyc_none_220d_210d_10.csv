My partner doesn’t drink, but will have kombucha sometimes. Does anyone know of bars in midtown/garment district that have kombucha? "
1,"Need budgeting advice!


Hi all! I have recently accepted a job in NYC and am trying to get my budget figured out. My salary will be $120k with an annual bonus of $6k. I don’t have much experience working with budgets but please let me know if any additional details would be helpful. 

I would like to live in a nice studio apartment because I know I won’t need much space. Basically just a place to cook, place to work, and a place to sleep is all I need.

Based on a few different methods, it seems that my rent could be somewhere in the ballpark of $3000/mo.

However, I’m not really anticipating a lot of COL factors that others consider. Specifically, I want to do a lot of cooking (and hence won’t be eating out too much), don’t drink or smoke or anything, etc. I’d like to redirect some of this money toward rent or stuff like a gym membership. 

With this in mind, how do I go about creating an appropriate budget? Because I’m coming from a rural area, I’m also curious which neighborhoods I should be looking at. 

I appreciate any help I can get!"
2,"Is Long Island City windier than the rest of NYC?


I’ve had to spend a lot of time in LIC lately, and it always seems there’s big gusts of wind when it’s not too bad out elsewhere in the city. Does it have something to do with LIC’s urban planning? "
3,"Outdoor spaces that look interesting in winter


Tuesday's weather is supposed to be insanely warm for February. Where could I go to take some cool photos outdoors? Usually I'd head to the Botanical Gardens but everything is so... dead."
