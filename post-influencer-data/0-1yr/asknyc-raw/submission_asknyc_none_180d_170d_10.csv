2,"Grocery shopping in NYC on a Sunday is an extreme sport


Me and my friends are visiting from the Bay Area this weekend and decided to go grocery shopping earlier today for the day’s festivities and the next week’s food plan. Figured since it was St Patrick’s day, the stores wouldn’t be as packed. Boy we were wrong lol.

We went to Union Square TJ’s, just a few blocks away from our hotel. It was madness. Lines everywhere. Employees have to hold end of line signs a million meters from checkout. Carts were bumping. We were extremely overwhelmed and mind you, we all used to work in retail so nothing really scares us lol. We ended up leaving 20 minutes later and decided to come back again tomorrow right when it opens. 

My friend is going to college here in the Fall so she had a clear vision of what’s to come. New Yorkers, what time and day do you grocery shop and where? Is Amazon Fresh or those delivery services worth the cost of such an inconvenience?"
3,"Do you recognize the same people during your commute?


I go to work and leave work at around the same time every day, I definitely leave work at the same time every day, and in years of taking the same route I never recognize or recall seeing the same person twice, I mean maybe once or twice and definitely the same hobos, but you'd think you'd see the same people more often, right? Do you?

&amp;#x200B;

To be fair, I'm not really looking around trying to remember people, but I think I would remember people if they had a certain way about them or defining characteristic. Is it just that people are generally boring and blend into one another or are the trains always taking people at different times so often that by the time you see someone again your brain has forgotten ever seeing them before?"
