1,"Those who workout after work, do you shower or wait till you get home?


The showers at my gym suck, tried for a week a year ago and the inconvience was too much. No bars or anything to put my stuff on and everything is exposed to getting wet.

But, it's right in the bottom floor of my job building.

So my question is, for those that workout after work, do you shower at the gym or commute back home smelly? "

3,"Best brunch spots in Harlem?


I'd like to create a list of new places to go for brunch in Harlem. It's an every-other-weekend thing for us and after a year I'm starting to want to try more spots. 

So far we've been to:

* Blvd Bistro (this is fantastic)
* Lido (the braised short rib hash is one of my favorite foods on this earth)
* The Grange (french toast to die for) 
* Red Rooster (kinda overpriced, actually)
* Sylvia's (couple years ago, not memorable)
* Harlem tavern (it was okay, not memorable) 

And...that's about all I can remember actually. Any other suggestions? "
