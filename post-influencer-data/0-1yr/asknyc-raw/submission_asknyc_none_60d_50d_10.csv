0,"Has anyone here ever been touched by a pigeon?


Yesterday I was walking down the street minding my own business when a pigeon flew by my head and basically slapped the shit outta me. Never in my 30 years of living here have I ever been touched by a pigeon. Just wondering if it’s a common occurrence."
1,"Am I wrong to assume if someone stops you in the street and starts giving you a whole story, they're probably a scammer?


Today I was walking to the train from my parents' house in Brooklyn and a guy stopped me and asked if I was from there. To me this was a red flag. I've been stopped here and in *foreign countries* and asked for help or directions without anyone asking if I was from there. 

Instead of answering, I said something like, ""What can I do for you?""

He started his story with, ""My wife and I are from Staten Island we were wondering if....""

I cut him off there with a ""Sorry"" and went on my way, since I assumed he was about to ask me for money to get back there.

But was I wrong not to wait to see what he wanted in case it was actually innocuous and he just happened to be a verbose weirdo?"
2,"I feel like I’m doing nyc wrong and I need help on how to have fun (at a lower $$$)


Been here for a year in grad school and was so busy I didn’t have time to do fun things. Now I have time but I just don’t know what to do..? I know it sounds silly but I’m trying to see the greatness of this city as other people see it. I’ve eaten at great restaurants and been to shows which have been great but they’re all expensive af (except for live tapings wooo)

What do people... do? for fun? I know how stupid this sounds but I think I’m just overwhelmed

I like food, cooking, coffee shops, (anything to do with food), trying new things... also trying to not drink"
3,"What would you do if you became dictator of NYC?


Assuming for some reason NYC (the 5 boroughs) becomes its own city-state and you’re the dictator of it, no need to worry about public opinion, getting gridlocked, or costs or anything like that."
