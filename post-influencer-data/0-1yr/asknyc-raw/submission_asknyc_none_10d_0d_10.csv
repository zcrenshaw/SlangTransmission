0,"Am I the only one who feel like NYC is a very “clicky” city?


I just moved to NYC after having lived abroad for years to pursue a new career. Personally I think this city is amazing, and has a lot to offer. But, it’s really clicky. Going out is not easy for someone like me.

I just turned 25, two days after I moved here, I originally lived in Asia but the social culture there around bars is to go out and meet people vs going with a group and sticking with them.

I spent a lot of time just wandering around and trying to meet people. Went to east village, Brookyln, koreatown, Astoria, etc
I also tried meet-ups but it’s just dudes trying to corner girls. Like a group of 4-5 guys go and they try to find the cute girls. Once they do they just corner them. 
But it’s whatever, I just won’t go back to those meet ups.

It may be because I’m a dude and people don’t take kindly to guys vs women socially. 
It seems like you make friends either through: 
- school 
- where you work 
- or through people you went to school or work with

Random encounters is a big no.  It doesn’t seem as if you can just walk up to someone and say “hey how are you? Nice to meet you” 
It’s been kind of a difficult transition for me. But I’m hoping something will happen soon to help me find my group.


Is there any advice you might have for someone like me?
Am I the only one who feels this way? 
I really want to start meeting people and going out, but currently feel kind of isolated and alone."
1,"Is there any 24 hour life left outside diners and bodegas?


Like, is there a de facto night market anywhere (not the Queens one which is lovely)? Is there a clothing store that just never closes? Are there LAN cafes? Where can I buy a fishtank at 4am?"
2,"Random people are always on my fire escape, is this just how it is?


Just moved Washington Heights and I'm on a ground level apartment with a fire escape that's a platform to my bedroom window. Easy to climb on from the street, no ladder or anything. I'm not worried about crime at all, but there's always groups of different people (2-4 people) that hop up on it and use it as their hang out spot. They usually leave after an hour but I'm wondering if this happens to a lot of people who are ground level. Is it just expected or do you do anything about it?"
3,"Where should a recently divorced 35-year-old male live in NYC?


My relationship of 15 years is ending and I have to move out of my UWS apartment by October 1st. 

I've only lived on the UWS so maybe it's time for a change — although I still like the neighborhood.

My budget is around $2600/month and I don't want roommates.

Should I move somewhere ""cooler"" downtown and get less space (i.e. a tiny studio in the Village) or should I be looking elsewhere? To be honest, I'm pretty fucked up from this divorce so my mind is all over the place.

P.S. I work in Manhattan."
