0,"Thank you, r/AskNYC!


Took my first trip to NYC over the weekend. NYC is a place that is infinitely different from what I'm used to and where I live. I just wanted to say thanks to everyone here for providing insight, suggestions, and tips for my trip whether it was from questions I asked directly or from posts that I lurked on. 

Everything (aside from LaGuardia) was awesome. Thanks for all the recommendations for things to do from Top of the Rock, a couple comedy shows, the Today show, a Broadway show, Yankees games, WWE Summerslam...for all the food recommendations (specifically John's of Bleecker St and Joe's Pizza on Carmine) that ruined all other food from back home for me, and for helping me navigate while walking more than I've ever walked in my life, taking actual public transportation for the first time, and figuring out the way the city is actually laid out. 

This sub was infinitely valuable to my wife and I, and after wanting to go to NYC for over 20 years and finally being able to do so, I just wanted to give a quick thanks to everyone. We already can't wait to be back!"
1,"What common NYC thing do you just not do - either for a legit or silly reason?


For example: I will never buy from the street fruit vendors. Whether it's legit or not, I just don't like the idea of fruit sitting out on the street because of grime, pollution, and no temp control.  Nope nope nope. "
2,"Do you say “Manhattan” or “The City”?


I’m a lifelong Brooklynite and almost exclusively refer to Mannhatan as “the city” (“We got dinner in the city” “My sister just moved from the city to Queens” etc.) I’m wondering if this is just a young person thing (I’m 22) or a more general saying. "
3,"Friend checked out a library book in '70s and hasn't returned it yet. Question about the late fee...


I feel bad for him, because he's got a library card with an amazing slew of benefits that it comes with (Kanopy, free museums, etc) but he avoids dealing with it. He feels that by now he probably owes a million dollars to NYPL due to a book he checked out in the '70s and still hasn't returned, so he simply avoids dealing with NYPL. 


My question: are late fees pardoned after a certain point? Or is he screwed? "
