0,"Where is slipping someone a $20 useful in NY?


A buddy and I went to Peter Luger's for dinner the other day. We didn't have a reservation so I was expecting to wait the length of the Lord of the Rings trilogy at the bar. My buddy pulled out a $20 and slipped it to the maitre d, and we were sitting 5 minutes later. This was also a week night, so I'm sure that number goes up on weekends.

It made me wonder, where else in the city is it useful to slip someone a $20? "
1,"AirPods in Manhattan


Does anyone else’s AirPods cut out while walking across an intersection? Literally every time I’m in manhattan and crossing the street, there’s some sort of interference and my music cuts out sporadically until I get to the other side.  Would anyone know why? "
2,"Pressure to be lean/thin in NYC


I'm not sure if this just another facet of the hyper-competitive life in NYC

I was really lean about a year ago. Recently got into a relationship and have slacked, maybe gained 10-15lbs. Several people around me (close friends, not mean) have asked ""what has happened to your fitness?"" 

Generally in the professional world everyone seems quite workout class obsessed, salad for lunch types. 

CAN I LIVE???!"
3,"What are some cool parts of New York that are older/more detached?


I've lived here for 7 years - 5 in Manhattan for school and the last couple years in BK/Queens. The longer I've lived away from Manhattan, the more interested I've become with some of the older more isolated and unique parts of the city relatively speaking, like The Hole, The Cloisters, Far Rockaway, etc. Places that seem overlooked in comparison to the more trendy, touristy attractions. Anyone have suggestions? Interested mostly in the Bronx, Queens, and BK but Manhattan too if there's something cool. Thank you!"
