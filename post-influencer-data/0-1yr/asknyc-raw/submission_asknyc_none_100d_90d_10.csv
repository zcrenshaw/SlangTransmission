0,"Ultimate NYC RENTING 101 thread


So you’ve decided you’re going to rent in NYC.

First thing you need to do is STFU about how expensive NYC is. Once you’ve got that out of your system, the second thing you need to do is read these archives on “Where should you move.”

We can’t decide that for you. Use our past archives and try to work it out yourself. 

Alright ready now?

#Where do I hunt for an apartment?

+ Craiglist
+ /r/NYCapartments 
+ StreetEasy
+ HotPads
+ Our body /u/tmm224 is our resident broker. 
+ Renthop

Here are some HOT tips on how to avoid being scammed.

+ If it's too good to be true. It probably is a scam
+ Moving in during the winter is cheaper than the summer
+ NEVER rent an apartment if you haven't physically visited it.
+ It's best to visit an apartment with a friend. (Better safe than sorry! I've been in some shady apartment searches by myself.)
+ If the broker asks you to meet at their office, it's a bait &amp; switch. Only meet at the apartment listed.

+ If the listing says no-fee, it doesn't hurt to double-check in person. Some apartments (esp. co-ops) will have an ""application fee"" that may also be sizable, or have an unusually large security deposit or up-front rent policy (first month, first &amp; last month, etc).
+ Some brokers will ask you to sign paperwork at the showing that gives them exclusive right to show you apartments and charge you their fee. Read that paperwork carefully, you may be signing on for something you don't want.
+ A lot of metadata on Streeteasy is bad - scummy brokers will list an apartment as 1 bedroom and the description or photos will describe a studio. Always read the description itself.

#What will I need to rent?

Landlord and/or Brokers are gonna need paperwork all the time.

We suggest creating multiple copies of the below items and keeping a folder.

+ 1040

+ W2

+ three consecutive recent pay stubs

+ three consecutive recent bank statements

+ letter of employment confirming length of employment and salary

+ signed reference letter from your previous landlord


#What are some things I should check out/ask?


+ Test out water pressure
+ Try the flush/shower test
+ Ask if the super is around/live in
+ See how far the train is
+ Where it the nearest laundromat, diner, bodega, supermercado
+ VISIT AT NIGHT TIME. WE CAN'T STRESS THIS ENOUGH.
+ VISIT ON THE WEEKENDS
+ See if you can chat with the neighbours
+ Check out the management company on google.




#What is the  40x rent rule

In New York, a common benchmark for determining your budget is that your annual salary must be 40x the monthly rent. For someone looking at $2,500/month apartments, they must earn a minimum of $100,000/year  (Read more on [StreetEasy](https://streeteasy.com/blog/how-to-afford-rent-nyc/))

This rule varies from time to time, depending on your landlord/management company. I have been around 4-5k short and gotten apartments due to the landlord just liking me. It is best to calculate your budget using this rule though. It's awesome to have a great apartment but if 90% of your income is going to your housing -- ya gonna have a bad time here.



#What to do once you're got the lease

Congrats you've been accepted. Make a copy of the lease and read read read it. Find any clause that is sus and ASK about it. Be sure to really be thorough. If it's all good and makes you happy. SCAN it - MAKE A COPY and KEEP IT.

I keep 2 copies in my apartment, and one in my google drive. It may be important some day.

#What to do when you're in the apartment.
+ Take pictures/video of the entire place, this is good for when you move out and wanna get your security deposit back.

1,"20YO Daughter came clean about Xanax addiction. Looking for good detox centers in NYC. Lost for words and torn.


I don’t know what to say besides I am shocked. My 20 year old, who’s in her 2nd year of college living in her own apartment here in the city, after having her 5th seizure from Xanax withdrawal (she’s lucky she is still even alive) has came clean to me. She was always a great kid. I have 2 other daughters (she’s the oldest) and SHE has been the easiest thus far. Good grades, never partied, no issues as an adolescent or with friends growing up. 

In 2017 of September when she was 18 she was given (legally) a prescription of Valium for sleep related anxiety. She would stay awake days at a time. I was kind of indecisive, but figured I’m not a doctor and she’s a responsible young adult. Well, 5mg of Valium turned into 20, then Valium turned into Xanax off street, now she’s at 3 “bars” 6MG a day. If she doesn’t have them she is physically ill- and apparently having seizures. This is the only substance she is abusing. Been googling for hours, but it’s a sh*tshow. Do I send her to rehab? In patient detox? I have no idea what to do. I’m willing to go out of pocket. Whatever it takes, really.

Any input is appreciated."
2,"How often do you do things with friends?


Maybe I'm feeling a little bit of late-20s FOMO, but I feel like I'm missing out on NYC social life. I'm curious--how often do you meet/get drinks/hang out with your friends? How often do you go to parties/events? Do you feel satisfied with your social life? Thanks!"
3,"Got a $45,000 charge from DEP out of nowhere


I got a bill in October showing my usual $40ish monthly water bill skyrocketing to $40,000. I help my senior father, who owns a three-family home in Queens and he's always paid (rather I have on his behalf) the bill on time. The bill shows a line of random ""cancellations"" of previous water bills we've paid and then at the bottom, shows tens of thousands of dollars in sewage and water fees. A pipe hasn't burst, we didn't fill up any Titanic-sized film set, and I sincerely doubt any of the two families have been able to consume more water than the rain we saw last night. I called and sent emails to DEP and they gave me a standard ""six-month"" review process, but in the meantime, we've racked up over $5,000 in late late fees and interest on something they haven't explained. Is there any recourse we have to figure out what we can do?

4,"Do you expect the food delivery guy to walk up to your apartment?


I just moved to the fourth floor of a walk up and I don't order delivery much so i'm not sure on the etiquette. The past few times the guy rang my apartment buzzer and walked up to my apartment door, but today he called my phone and said he was waiting outside so i went down to get my food. 

I don't mind either way and i don't want to sound like i'm lazy or complaining. I'm just curious what other people think is common practice? Also how does it work in elevator or doorman buildings?"
