0,"NYC Emergency Vehicle Mentality


So I've stayed in NYC for a week, traveling from abroad and one thing that shocks me is the total lack of consideration or even respect for emergency vehicles.

Essentially nobody seem to care that the siren is going, people are parallell driving alongside instead of stopping and pulling over.
Cars are cutting off ambulances and pedestrians are running in front at the very last second. 

Seeing this really makes my blood boil and I can't believe this is even tolerated, as I would hope it is illegal? 
Should this not be followed up by the police? Or have they just given up? 

Any locals that can fill me in on this? I just can't believe what I am seeing.
I dread to think of all the lost lives due to egoistic drivers and pedestrians."
1,"How was your commute yesterday?


I drove in from DELAWARE!! I left at 11:45am and miraculously made it home in the Bronx at 4:45pm. I was pissed at the time, but compared to some of the other horror stories Iâ€™ve heard, I think I may have had the grace of god on my side averaging 30-35 mph (it was snowing down there heavily with no salt too). How was your commute?"
2,"How often you do order delivery (seamless, grubhub, etc)?


Just curious, as a lot of my friends use it often but I never really got delivery before I moved to NYC anyway so I never started. 

However, I did order something off grubhub this week because I got free delivery and now I'm thinking about doing it again... is this how the cycle starts? Help"
