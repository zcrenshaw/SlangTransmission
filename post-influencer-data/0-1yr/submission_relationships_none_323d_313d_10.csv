"My [22M] girlfriend [20F] of 9 months called her ex and he went to her house.


Hi Reddit,

&amp;#x200B;

So a couple nights ago my girlfriend went out for halloween. We have been going through a rough patch recently, it has mostly been my fault but neither of us are perfect, but I am working on it. She has always told me about how much she hates her ex, never wants to see him again and could never be friends with any of her exes, and has always imposed strict boundaries about us not seeing or speaking to exes.

&amp;#x200B;

So after the halloween party, she was thnking about our relationship and realised she wasn't happy. She then felt like the only person she could speak to about it was her ex. She phoned him and he went over her house to talk. They spoke about their relationship and why he did such shitty things to her, and her relationship with me now. She has told me that nothing happened, but I am wondering what if he made a move on her. Would she be able to say no even though she was so drunk and emotional?

&amp;#x200B;

When I woke up in the morning, she phoned me straight away and said she had been up all night but did not say it was with him. I said get some rest, and planned to go over to hers when she woke up with lots of food, snacks and hangover stuff. She phoned me an hour or 2 after our first phone call to explain how she had seen her ex last night, and was very sorry and sad about it, but said doing it made her realise that we need a break and she still has some feelings for him, as he was her first love. Initially I said that I didn't mind, if she felt it was right then it's fine and I trust her. Now, looking back, I feel betrayed. I was never allowed to speak to exes and she made this clear and I always respected her, turning a lot of girls away from even being friends when she wasn't comfortable, and then she does this behind my back.

&amp;#x200B;

I don't know what to do. We're currently having a break, but all I want is answers from her and just to understand why she met him and how she feels about him, but I feel like she won't be honest with me and even if she is I don't think I can trust her anymore. I do genuinly believe they didn't do anything, because he said he wasn't interested in her romatically, but how do I know what she would have done if he made a move on her. I fele like I've lost all trust in her.

&amp;#x200B;

tl;dr: Girlfriend met up her ex behind my back, and has realised that we need to go on a break. I feel hurt and betrayed."
"Girlfriend posted a seductive video of her on her Tumblr behind my back


 

Hey everyone,

Need some advice. My girlfriend of 2 months recently went to Winnipeg for a week to visit her best friend. While she was their I noticed that she posted a pretty seductive video on her tumblr that she recorded while she was still here. It was pretty much her smoking out of a bong with a side view of her ass in a thong. She was wearing a hoodie. It also had a bunch of hashtags like ''Tell me how hot I am'', ''Talk to me'', ''Bored'' and shit like that. She doesn't know I have seen her Tumblr before so I felt like she did this behind my back. I ended up confronting her about it and she said she did it because she felt body positivity and felt like Tumblr was her safe space. As for the hashtags she said she only posted them because she wanted some creep to msg her so she can send them a funny ''reaction'' meme she found and block them after. I'm honestly pretty sure shes lying about that but I'm going to wait till shes home to talk to her face to face. The thing is she doesn't strike me as a person who would cheat. Shes been cheated on before and my friend was at a party with her recently and she told him that she was sad I wasn't there and was acting pretty distant from everyone. Like I said I'm waiting for her to come back and talk but what do yall think about this situation? I personally feel she wanted a confidence boost and posted to get some validation as she has had some insecurities in her past. I also feel she might have been worried I would judge her or attack her if she did bring this up with me. The only thing I want from her is honesty and trust. Any thoughts would be appreciated.

Thank you

 Also this isn't common behavior in her tumblr. She's never really posted something like that so I was surprised she did it while she's in a relationship with me.

&amp;#x200B;

  tl;dr ; Girlfriend posted a seductive video of her wearing a thong on tumblr. Don't know what to think of it because she did it behind my back and seemed she wanted validation from others even though she says this wasn't the case. "
"I (23, F) think my (36, F) girlfriend is going through a mid life crisis


My (36, F) girlfriend of one year and I (23,F) are doing a long distance relationship as of two months ago when I moved away for my work. Apart from her having an issue being emotionally available sometimes, we have a very healthy relationship and she’s beginning to talk more than ever. Lately, she has been extremely unhappy - with her work, hobbies, friends and what she is doing in life. 

She used to play two different kinds of sports for her whole life and she’s stopped that because it was too hard on her joints at her age. She hates the people she used to play sport with because they didn’t appreciate her on the team in her words, (they didn’t ask her to play again this year) She now hates her work she has been doing for under 20 years and wants to leave and do something else but “get paid the same” she is in a very good position at the moment. She dislikes her friends, she thinks they’re all selfish and have the wrong priorities about everything. She blows them off all the time to spend time alone. She stopped exercising, started smoking for the past 4 months. She has just started training again in the gym (She used to train everyday) The reoccurring theme with all these things is that she feels undervalued, she told me nobody appreciates the time and effort she puts in for other people and everyone takes her for granted. She’s very defensive about me trying to be understanding and give her any advice on the phone. She said, “I’m in a rut and I don’t know what I’m doing with my life anymore”. I don’t know what else I can do in this situation. She’s a LOT less loving than usual and I miss the old her because she is so fun and charismatic normally but now she’s become so depressed, boring and negative about everything. I want to be there for her. What can I do to make this better for her and in turn for us? She apologised on the phone for being so “in a rut” lately. I feel really bad for her. I tried sending some gifts in the mail that were personalised for her so she felt special since she’s feeling so undervalued but it didn’t seem to do much at all. 

TL;DR
My girlfriend of one year used to be really exciting, sporty and loving and now she’s very depressed, boring and negative. She doesn’t play sport anymore, she wants to quit her job, she is smoking, she doesn’t hang around with her friends like she used to all the time. Is she depressed? What can I do to help this situation? "
"I think my [20F] FWB [18M] is manipulating me, love bombing me and is a narcissist


My FWB and I agreed to be FWB just because we are in different in our points of life. Regardless of this we still stay with each other most nights and sometimes 4 days or 15/18 hours together.  He acts very affectionate, which is fine. I don’t believe him but that’s not the issue. We also just met a few months ago and he said he loved me pretty much 2 weeks in or something. He also is lying about his sexual relations with other people (I don’t care about it either way but it’s kinda like...you don’t need to lie about that if we’re only FWB). It’s hard to explain without seeing the whole conversion, he basically says shit like “you make my whole day better” and “I like it when you’re here so my stuff can smell like you / you leave your hairs here so I can remember you” “I want to spend every moment of my life with you” “as soon as you leave I miss you”



It just all built up to an “aha” moment when I talked to my friend about this. I think love bombing me, and it makes total sense when I put everything into context. He says that he loves me all the time, he tells me how much I mean to him and that I make him the happiest. I don’t give a fuck that we can’t date and he says this, I’m upset because I feel like he’s manipulating me and I’ve been in a manipulative relationship before which is why I’m surprised I didn’t see red flags from the start. I woke up to 8 texts from him saying how much he loves me, how much I mean to him and how I make him the happiest he’s ever been. This happens a lot.


What does he get out of love bombing me? What did he get out of manipulating me? What does he get out of any of this? I told him straight up we are FWB (but best friends) yet he continues this shit. We had a talk saying we won’t put our lives on hold for each other (this is a big one : he always says if he’s older he’d date me) so we both know where we stand.
I don’t mind the affection but I hate it when it’s fake and when it feels like a way to get something you want.


He is a bit religious so  maybe he feels guilty for fucking with NSA. Is it even worth it to bring this up to him? I enjoy what we have now and don’t want to ruin it, but I don’t want him to lie and manipulate me just to get it. If I were to word it, how would I?



** TL:DR : I met someone, we both admitted we had feelings but decided to be FWB. The only reason we aren’t dating is I’m in the middle of my college career and he just started it.  He still says how much he loves me, how I give him his happiest moments, and if he was older we’d date even though agreed to strictly be FWB. I have a feeling he lies about who he’s sleeping with, and I have a feeling he’s manipulating me and love bombing me to keep stringing me along. I feel like he loves the power of feeling liked by someone or feeling affection. **

"I (21M) want to stop lying to my girlfriend (23F).


I have an awful habit of lying in situations to the persons involved to avoid getting into trouble or disappointing them. This has happened twice in my current 1.5 year relationship and its affecting the trust she has in me, and I don't blame her one bit. Honestly, I didn't realize that I had this problem until recently, and am willing to do anything to fix my problem, and rebuild the trust in our relationship. I'm not trying to avoid blame because I know I'm in the wrong, but I think this stems from having very strict parents growing up, and I would lie in situations to avoid being punished; mostly dumb stuff like ""did you study today"" or ""have you finished your homework"". Most of the time, this worked, and I just realized that it was easier to lie than to tell the truth and have to explain the complexities of the situation.

The first time my girlfriend caught me in a lie, it was over me trying to cut down on my fapping. She asked me the last time that I jerked off and I was ashamed to tell her the real answer, and lied. I didn't even make a conscious decision to lie, it just came out in an effort to avoid disappointing her.

The more recent time was this week. Over the past few months, I've been trying to kick my cigarette habit. I was doing great until Friday, where I was craving one really badly, and caved and bought a pack. I didn't tell my girlfriend that I relapsed on Friday, and we got into an unrelated argument the following day. I had some errands to run, and being stressed out, I had a few cigs. I came back, smelling like cigarettes and she questioned me about it. I told her that I had only had one, when in reality, I've had quite a few.

She ended up finding out the truth, and that I had lied to her again. She was upset (rightfully so), not because I smoked, but because I lied to her again. Looking back, I realize that I only lied in order to avoid disappointing her even more, but in reality, she didn't care in the first place if I smoked or not.

I've made it a goal in the future to be conscious of when I lie, and to not automatically say something untruthful even if it means hurting my own pride, or someone elses' feelings. How can I keep myself on track? Many of the times when I lie, I don't even consciously think before I do it. Are there any other steps I can take to become a more truthful individual, and to begin to rebuild the trust in this relationship?  


\*\*TL;DR; : How do I stop lying to get out of trouble?\*\*"
"I [40F] Am Tired of Providing Free Therapy to my Best Friend [46F]


I \[40F\] have been friends with Paula (not her real name) \[46F\] for about 20 years. For about half of our friendship we lived far apart -- I left our hometown over a decade ago and we kept in touch over the phone, via email, social media, etc. About a year ago she took a job in the city I live in, and we've been able to see each other on a regular basis, which is great. I really value her friendship. She is smart, funny, and fun to be around. I can trust her with any secret and sometimes she's the only person in the world who knows how I really feel about something. I believe she has the same kind of relationship with me. Neither of us have ever been married and there have been many instances where we helped each other through rough times, helped each other make difficult decisions, and just plain looked out for each other.

There have also been a few times where Paula kind of dropped off the face of the earth and I didn't see her or talk to her for a year or more. This has usually been during the times she's had a boyfriend, though not always. It used to really bum me out when she disappeared, but I've learned over the years that she always comes back and we're able to pick up our friendship right where it left off. I do have to say that this lack of stability has made me hesitant to do anything in the relationship to rock the boat. 

Which brings me to the present. Paula just got out of a long-term relationship about 8 months ago, then took a new job and moved to a new city. These were all hard transitions to make (especially all at once) but overall she's doing well. She has clinical depression but is taking meds. 

About 3 months ago she met a guy while she was on a business trip and the two of them had a one-night stand that turned into a long-distance relationship. She sees him a couple weekends a month and they text all day long. I believe they refer to each other as boyfriend/girlfriend. 

I am not onboard with this relationship because I strongly feel she should grieve her previous relationship and settle into her new job / life / city before she embarks on anything new. She disagrees: she says she's doing fine with the transitions and there's no reason she shouldn't be dating. She often feels depressed and anxious but thinks this is perhaps because her antidepressants are no longer working.  I think that she should get that checked out, but she uses the excuse of not feeling like going through the hassle of finding a new doctor here. 

When I tried to give her some reasons against pursuing this guy, she told me that she was tired of me playing devil's advocate and that what she needed me to do was just be supportive. I explained to her that I don't dislike him and that I'm just worried about her, but she kind of brushed me off. Another reason I'm not a fan of her relationship is because he has really triggered some deep insecurities and psychological issues in her. He seems like a decent enough guy but she is constantly worried that he's cheating on her and/or that he's going to break up with her. Anytime she has a mini-meltdown over this dude I'm the one who has to talk her off a ledge, and it happens all the time. She's afraid to let him know about the anxiety she feels because she's concerned that he's going to think she's ""crazy"" and dump her. 

Now we're at a point where I'm actively avoiding her. I am tired of listening to her freak out all the time over whether this guy is going to dump her, while at the same time not letting me offer advice that she does not deem as ""supportive."" She has deep trust and abandonment issues due to things that happened to her as a child, and I REALLY do not think that she should be in a long-distance relationship. I have the utmost sympathy for what she's been through and I can relate to her desire to take risks in the name of love, but I believe she needs to be in therapy rather than blundering through this and relying solely on her friends when her mental health wavers. (I say ""friends"" but I'm not sure if any her other friends are aware of the situation like I am.) 

How can I, with kindness, set a boundary and let her know that I think she needs to seek help from a mental health professional? How can I, with kindness, let her know that I'm not comfortable hearing about her relationship anxieties any more? I don't want our friendship to fall apart because of this. 

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR: I believe my best friend has psychological issues and that she needs help from a mental health professional rather than depending on me for support, but I don't know how to broach the subject without seeming unkind or damaging the friendship."
"I [25F] am about to lose my boyfriend [26M] of 8 years because of my mental issues


I grew up with a very loving mother, but a distant father and a distant brother. My father and brother are both in the autism spectrum. I have always been depressed, I remember being 11 years old and going home after grade school and just.. sleeping. I'm also a big girl, that might be related. 


I have also always struggled with motivation. I did okay in school, but I could have done so much more. 


When I was 15, my mother died of Leukemia. It took a while for that to sink in. She was my main source of support, and she left. It was just me, my dad and my brother. I met my boyfriend around this time, I think it was when I was 14.


My motivation in life just.. dropped. I think my brain has blocked a lot of memories, since I can't really remember my life from 15-20 years old. I didn't go to school anymore. Eventually I got kicked out. My dad's new girlfriend moved in with us a few weeks after my mom died. I think it was just his way of coping, I believe he loved my mother dearly. My boyfriend and I got together when I turned 17, after years of internet flirting. I'm his first girlfriend, he's my first boyfriend.


His new girlfriend and I did not get along. Eventually I moved out, with my boyfriend and his family. But that didn't last long for different, and eventually we both moved into my dad's attic.


It wasn't fun living there, our once loving house was just.. breaking down. It was just plain dirty. The relationship with my dad got even more strained. My boyfriend didn't like living there, and he was quite uncomfortable.


So at the age of, I think, 22 we eventually moved out. We both got different student rooms. We study in different cities, so we lived 1.5 hrs apart. It went okay. I was still struggling, and I have always been very needy. I need a lot of attention since I'm scared of being left. I'm still depressed, and I gained even more weight. 


At this point I got really sick. I got Idiopathic Intracranial Hypertension, a.k.a. a brain tumor without the tumor but just the symptoms. I couldnt eat for weeks, and got severely dehydrated next to other symptoms (double vision, cross eyed, the worst headache imaginable). I did lose around 8 kilos. 


I got medicated, and my sickness was gone! All this time I had been at my bf's, since I couldn't take care of myself. I stayed with my boyfriend for a while, but eventually he decided he needed a break from our relationship, because of my weight, my motivation and other issues (like bad with money). This took around 3 months.


I decided to lose weight, and it worked. I lost around 20 kilos. We eventually got back together again. I think that was 2 years ago. My weight loss stalled for a few months, but I maintained, I didn't gain any. Eventually I regained my motivation and lost more. I have lost around 33 kilos. However, to this day I'm still struggling to find motivation, to be independent. I'm in college right now but I'm struggling to find direction. My boyfriend is very driven, ambitious and well educated. He can go far in life. I'm holding him back. 


So where we are right now: He has a lot of deadlines, and told me he preferred to be alone for a while. But I struggle with that because of my intense fear of being left. I smother him. It was tense, but he seemed loving. It was clear to me he was struggling with something, but he kept telling me: I love you, I just need to be alone for a bit. I asked him when we could be together again, since I hadn't seen him in a while. At first it would be yesterday, but I offered to move that to monday. That got pushed back to wednesday, and now it won't even be wednesday.


Just now we called, and he finally ws honest to me: he needs alone time because he wants to think about our relationship, because he isn't sure anymore. He says I need a lot of attention and general help in life, from money issues to things like needing to watch me in traffic.


We love eachother so much, but I'm just such a piece of work. I wish we could go through this together and come out stronger, but I feel like it's too late for him. He told me he loves me so much, and I love him so much too.


Please don't think I'm a bad girlfriend, I love him a lot and I do a lot for him. I'm very caring, and he says I'm very sweet, and he truly loves me. I believe that, he's generaly a very closed guy and wouldn't just say that. We have so much in common, we love eachother so much and have so much fun together, but I just have so many issues.


I just want to be a productive member of society my boyfriend can be proud of 


But it doesn't feel like a real possibility


And I think I'm gonna lose him


And I'm not sure how to cope


TL;DR: I have a lot of mental problems, and my boyfriend is reconsidering our relationship because of it."
"How does one not go full Boyle?

"I'm [F22] born and raised in Scandinavia but my parents are from eastern Europe. They [M/F60s] are college educated, have lived in Scandinavia for over 30 years but are still overly homophobic. I'm tired of hearing them mock gay people and call them mentally deviant. How do I change their views?


I love my parents and they've always been good parents to me and my siblings. They're actually resonable people, smart and educated, secular and have good morals. However, they've always had a negative view of homosexuality. When I was growing up I was told that it's not normal and that those people are mentally deviant. As I got older I understood it was a myth because the LGBT people I came in contact with were normal and well adjusted people just like me.

I now have plenty of LGBT friends and it saddens me that my parents still hold these outdated views. It bothers me a lot because they aren't cave people. They've been to college, my father is an engineer and my mother is a teacher. They are intellectuals, read a lot of books and active in the societal debate. They vote progressively/leftish and I pointed out that those parties are very pro LGBT and they were like ""yeah well we vote on economic issues/anti capitalism, don't care about LGBT"".

My dad is the most active. Whenever he sees a gay couple on TV or in media he will say loudly ""these people aren't normal"", ""this is against nature"". My mom is a lot more mellow and mostly keeps her opinions to herself but won't say anything against my dad.

It just baffles me that my parents are so ignorant on this single issue but resonable on anything else. I also feel like I can't sit in silence while they keep mocking LGBT people and tossing around myths that are actually harmful for the wellbeing of sexual minorities.

Any advice on how to change their views or at least mellow them out a bit?

Tldr: parents are ignorant on this issue and it baffles me why. "
"My [22] boyfriend's [22] sister [24] keeps spreading lies about us


Me and my boyfriend have been together for 2.5 years. He keeps very limited contact with his family, as they are quite terrible people and he enjoys his life without their negative influence and criticism. However, he does talk to them occasionally since they are his family. His sister loves being the center of attention and would do anything to get the spotlight. The problem in this whole situation is that she keeps making stories up and talking s*** about people in general and in the last year or so about us.

As I mentioned before my boyfriend talks very little to them about us or our life (but at the same time listens to his sister ranting for hours at a time about her life.) So his sister has been left with little to no information about our life. I have been the one to tell my bf to start an information diet with his sister, ever since this started happening and it seemed to work for a while.

Up until she started making stories up and honestly they have been really getting on my nerves. Last Christmas my bf's father (his parents are divorced and live separately) asked me why is my bf paying all the bills and the rent. I was really confused as me and my bf split all bills and rent equally since both of us work. And he said that my bf's sister told him that my boyfriend is paying for everything and that I'm just mooching off him. 

Or just a couple days ago my bf started getting congratulations messages from some of his childhood friends, saying ""congrats on your gf's pregnancy"". But I'm not pregnant and don't want children at all. When asked where they heard this from, you guessed it, his sister. And just little stuff like this, you get the idea. I feel really irritated that this person keeps spreading lies even after my bf has limited contact to bare minimum. How do I get this to stop?

tl;dr: My boyfriend's sister keeps spreading lies about us. People are believing them until we tell them otherwise. How do I stop this?"
"Having trouble with boyfriend's bedtime routine?


Hi everyone. My boyfriend (27 male) and I (25 male) have been dating for almost a year. Since moving in together two months ago, I’ve had some trouble getting used to his nighttime routine. 

A typical night goes as follows: we’ll get ready together and go to bed at between 10 and 11 pm. Now, whereas I like to fall asleep as soon as I hit the hay, he’ll toss and turn and scroll through social media for at least another hour. I’m a light sleeper, so even if I turn to my side to ignore him, I have a really hard time dozing off. We’ve discussed this and he’s since set his screen brightness to a minimum and ditched the earphones (I could hear the sound from videos coming through). I guess that’s an improvement, but I still find it hard to fully fall asleep with any kind of commotion next to me.

He says the screen helps him lull off. As for me, I’m used to getting my uninterrupted 7-8 hours of sleep. That’s the only way I can handle getting up at 6 am for work. It’s not just the phone and the tossing around that’s the problem, though. When he’s ready to sleep, he’ll usually roll over to my side to cuddle up. I don’t mind this, but he can’t seem to keep still. He’ll either move his legs, nudge me with his head or get up to pee because he doesn't go before bedtime as a rule, only if he really has to.

I don’t know what to do about this. We haven’t had any other issues since moving in. I don’t want for either of us to sleep on the couch, of course. Have any of you guys encountered a similar problem and how have you approached it?

TL;DR: Boyfriend and I have different sleeping habits and we’re having a hard time meeting in the middle."
"Infidelity resulted in pregnancy


I recently found out that my (32F) SO (40M) of a year and a half cheated on me with his ex-wife and she’s pregnant. This happened in June one weekend when she came to drop off clothes for their daughter.  I was out of town.

He says this was a one-time mistake and he has no interest in getting back with her. He feels there was no closure in their divorce and he’s been carrying this baggage and unresolved issues since. An argument over how things ended for heated and apparently, they hooked up in the moment. 

For the first year of our relationship, I tried to convince him to have a child with me if we were to get married.  The last six months or so, he started to come around and agreed...he was even excited and had started talking about our future family.  I’m heart broken and devastated that the dream I had is not happening for me, but for her. 

We had a very healthy and happy relationship, our sex life was great, and we were actively planning for the future before this happened. I am torn because in my heart I still love him, but I’m not sure how to get past this.  My family loves him, his family loves me, I love his daughter, but I’m not sure how I’d be able to get past this and care for a child born out of his infidelity. 

Has anyone else been in this situation? What did you do? If you stayed, how did you deal with the child?

Tl;dr: SO cheated with ex-wife, she’s pregnant, what do I do?"
"Just found out my(24) friend (24) is homeless


He's been living on the streets for months.. about a year ago his fiance passed away and since then he's just lost everything. 
Shelters in our country (South Africa) are fucking dangerous. He has been attacked there before and won't go back. I am currently unemployed and living with my family..
How do I help him? 
He was always such a happy guy, and a childhood friend that helped me out quite a bit. . I know he needs a job but scared if he doesn't get proper help he won't be able to uphold it. 
I really need some guidance here..
One of my other friends says she can take him food and toiletries tomorrow. But I don't know what to do besides this? (I live far from the city so I can't just pop in and feed him every day and offer emotional support, even though I wish I could)

"Me [28] and my boyfriend [30] hung out with his ex [30]. I thought they were acting weird.


So, my boyfriends ex came over tonight to have dinner with us. I felt a tension and some stiffness, making me think they were not sure how to act around me. And therefore also making me think they are not over each other. Also they ""dissapeared"" together two times, like when they went to the kitchen to get more food they were there suspicially long. 

My boyfriend directed most of his attention to her, looking closily at her hand gestures. He was barely looking at me. 

I don't know when I should trust my gut, since I've been cheated on before I often think it's mostly in my head. And if the last one is true I don't want to bother him with my crazy thoughts. What can I do? It's making me hate myself.

They haven't been a couple since like six years ago. We have been together for almost three years.

For more background/issues with my SO you can read my latest post (only one before this one).

TL;DR: SO and I hung out with his ex. Thought they were acting weird, but is it just in my head due to trust issuies from being cheated on by my ex?"
"I (21M) am considering cutting my alcoholic parents (50M, 47F) out of my life. I love them. They love me. Their lifestyle and unwillingness to help themselves just makes me so angry and upset to the extent I think ceasing contact would help, what do you think?


 After advice for anyone who has done this or considered this.

For a better context of things, feel free to read this post I made a few months ago I've linked in the first post of this thread.

In short, though - my parents are alcoholics. Always have been, probably always will be. I grew up with them both not having jobs, and getting drunk every night together. That led to some great moments with them - they're not nasty people. But it also led to a \*lot\* of arguments and fights growing up too. My Mum is on welfare and has issues. My dad is her ""carer"" lol. They drink 6-7 cans of larger every night and cannot see they have a problem. They get up at like 5pm in the day and go to bed at like 6am.

I'm currently a university student, and since being at university the last couple of years, their lifestyle has just got worse. They're both in really bad health and won't help themselves as they're stuck in their rut. They've pushed their family and friends away and virtually have no one because of the way they argue with people or do not contact people. Their financial situation is atrocious. All this weighs on my mind. I know if my Dad died suddenly - my mum would have no one. And likewise.

The issue I have is I am angry and sad at them. I love them so much, but they just don't want to help themselves in life. I know they love and care about me, and despite the fact they are alcoholics they did try their best for me growing up - and because of that it isn't easy to cut them off. But since being at university the last couple of months, they haven't bothered to pick up the phone once to me. Not a text or call. I've contacted them, but they won't answer the phone if they've not had a drink. And the text conversations we've had - its just be constant doom and gloom. ""The ballifs came today. We're ill. We've fallen out with another family member."" - All this just depresses me, as I see them just stuck in a rut. And its really messing with my mental health.

The other day I spent an hour trying to call them. I Just kept ringing and ringing, knowing I was annoying them - simply because I \*know\* they were there just ignoring me - because I've seen that is what they do to everyone. At this point I'm angry and say ""are not capable of answering the phone when I call? I've tried to contact you three times lately at normal hours. You've ignored me every time."" My Mum's response was ""oh, like you did on my birthday!!!"" - this is true, I wasn't able to contact her on her birthday. My phone had broke the same day. I had sent her flowers and I sent her a FB message explaining I wouldn't be able to call but wished her a nice day and I'll ring tomorrow. My brother doesn't even get her a card and she \*never\* rang her mum on her birthday. Its situations like this that just piss me off.

It's really hard to put into words why I have this urge to cut contact with them. There is anger inside me because of the way we grew up - we never did family things. And even though I still love them - the more I think about them and I'm in touch with them, the more they anger me and sadden me. They're still young, still have so much potential, they have a grandchild (my brother, who has little contact with them but lives close and kinda uses them when he needs help with the kid), but they've just given up. I feel like if I do cut contact with them its almost like throwing more oil onto the fire as it would hurt them - it would hurt me too. I just don't know how to approach my relationship with them. I feel like I'm being hurt by still caring.

TL;DR - Really feel like I need to cut them out of my life to keep myself feeling sad and angry. But its hard because I love them and don't have much family."
"Me [25F] and my roommate [30M] have completely different views on the mice living in our apartment. I am completely beside myself.


Hi!

Context: I moved into this apartment in April of this year. My roommate had been living in this apartment with a friend of his but he was moving to a different state so I took his place. We swam in the same social circle and I would have considered us loose friends

I had noticed there was a ton of stuff in the apartment when I was viewing it initially but I had naively thought that when his roommate left, half of the stuff would go with him. Not the case. This apartment is FILLED with crap. His bedroom is lined with just with shit. Piles maybe 2-3 feet tall depending on where you are looking. Piles of boxes, spare furniture, milk crates filled with stuff. The living room is also lined with more crap. I have one piece of furniture in the living room and the rest is his own furniture, piles of boxes, bookshelves packed with more shit. There is no open wall in the living room at all.  I don't spend time in there because the clutter triggers my anxiety. I was in a desperate situation when I moved in so I kept my mouth shut. I keep my own room clean, tidy, and uncluttered and that has kept me happy thus far. 

However, now there are mice and I am borderline hysterical. We do live in New England (northeast part of the US) and it is getting colder so I logically understand that the mice are trying to keep warm. But, I have NEVER had mice in my living space. Maybe in the attic or basement but never ever in the actual house. I have seen them running across my bedroom floor and they have been burrowing in my clothes. I set up a live trap underneath my bed and have already caught and released (miles away) multiple mice in the week I have noticed it happening. I think it is absolutely disgusting. My room is tidy and I don't keep food in here. But, I think they like it because my room is warmest in the house.

When I brought up the problem to my roommate, he had a ""this is how it is"" attitude and explained to me that mice come into houses when it's cold in a very belittling way. And, that we just have to not leave any food out and set up traps. He doesn't seem particularly bothered by them. And explained he has glue traps in his room and gets rid of them multiple mice a week. I tried bringing it up again a few days later and he, again, brushed it off like it is a normal part of life and seemed annoyed I brought it up again. I got desperate enough to call our landlord behind his back and she also just told me to put up traps. I even spoke to the lady that lives below us (we are in a multi-family home) and she said she has been living here 10 years and has never once seen a mouse. 

I'm feeling horribly overwhelmed. The worst part for me is that my roommate and I are not on the same page. I feel like if we were a united front on this, I would feel so much better. But, him not caring about the situation makes me feel like I'm crazy for caring there are mice in my bedroom. I would LOVE LOVE LOVE to move out but my car dumped out on me recently and has left my bank account in a pretty pathetic position. I'm not locked into a lease or anything. Just simply can't afford to move. I will most likely be able to recover enough to move maybe summer/fall of next year. But, that is a long time away and I feel like I'm losing my mind. Any advice would be appreciated!!! 

tl;dr Roomate doesn't really care there are mice infesting our apartment. I do. It's creating a large rift that I am not sure how to fix. "
"UPDATE: ""I (M/30) want to patch things up with female friend/colleague (F/30). Should I make first contact?""


 OP thread - [https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/9qfuy2/i\_m30\_want\_to\_patch\_things\_up\_with\_female/](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/9qfuy2/i_m30_want_to_patch_things_up_with_female/)

So, i made the first move and contacted via text (short birthday note) as some advised. She replied with a polite thanks and hope i am well too. So very short interaction.

I am relieved she replied. Just to know she is at least responding is good. I didnt apologize for not answering the phone calls as suggested by others since she may have needed the space. Now the next step is do i pursue a conversation now, or do I wait a few days or weeks after this. Or in the end, wait until we meet at work at the end of the year.

Anyways thanks again for the previous responses. This is much better than i actually expected, and hopefully we can be friends again in the future.

TL;DR - Made first contact. She replied. Maybe can start the friendship up again with further contact. But this time more carefully.  Thanks all for the advice and wisdom."
"My [33/m] GF [30/f] of 4 years, lied to me about hanging out with another guy along with a bunch of other suspicious instances that make me believe something is up Let me know if I am wrong for feeling like i do..HELP!


Sorry for the book I am writing, i just want to get this all out so you can see what I am dealing with and possibly give me some advice (making it as honest as possible cause i need some other opinions)...  


 My \[33/m\] GF {30f\]of 4 years recently started a new job a few months ago.  She has had many guy friends strictly platonic in the past and in the beginning of our relationship I was insecure about this.  We talked about how she always had guy friends nothing to worry about, introduces me to many of her long time guy friends.    
   Recently she started grabbing drinks after work (she works at bar) with her male coworker which i am fine with since we live in a new state and she wants to make friends.  I start seeing his name in her text messages when she is texting while sitting next to me, which is fine with me.  She tells me i should meet him and we would like each other which has happened with past male friends of hers.  I know they have hung out with a group of coworkers grabbing drinks a couple times and thats about it.

   Two weeks ago, she tells me she is grabbing drinks with one of her girlfriends and that her male coworker is going to join them too.  Im totally fine with that and so they go out and grab drinks.  Next morning,  I cant find my phone so i pick hers up off the night stand while she is sleeping and its on the text to her girlfriend saying her ""hot"" coworker is coming.  I ask her about it later when she wakes up and how her night with her girlfriend and ""hot"" male coworker was and told her i saw the text. She said ""it was fun went out had drinks with them and then the male coworker got super drunk so they (my gf and her girlfriend) decided to leave. She said she had invited him because her friend thought he was hot. It didn't bother me, in fact i didn't even think anything of it since I trust her.  
   Over the next few weeks, I see more of his name in her phone and ask her some more about him since they text and work together, but i only hear of him when they got out for drinks with coworkers after work and maybe one or two small fact about him.  She immediately gets defensive when i start asking more about him. I'm asking questions about who he is, whats his deal, where is he from originally etc etc.  She starts right off in a very defensive voice and saying ""are you really asking me about him, why are you jealous, you need to relax"".  In the beginning of our relationship, she told me if i ever was nervous or felt insecure just ask because when I don't thats when problems happen and i get jealous and assume, which i can agree on.  This time, i was generally asking, I mean i would like to know who my gf is hanging out with rather than he's just a coworker and 1 or 2 random facts.  
   The other day, my friends were having a big party and said invite whoever you want, so my gf said she was inviting her male coworker and his male roommate and his gf, ""Cool, cant wait to meet him"" i said.  While she was waiting for them to show up, i kept seeing her peer over to the door, acting almost overly excited.  She loves introducing me to people so i figure thats it,  Then i go upstairs and see her texting and walk over towards her to see what and her friend are doing and she immediately turns her back on me and acts a little sketchy with her phone.  I didnt think anything of it, its whatever.  Guy shows up we talk for a few minutes, shake hands, introduce ourselves while we are standing in a small group outside.  I decided to go get a drink 20 minutes later so i walk away out of sight  and realize i forgot my cup, so i got back to where the small group is standing and male coworker and my gf are shoulder to shoulder laughing, they were about two feet apart before. Im fine with it, brush it off, everyone had some drinks.  Little bit later i walk out, he had his arm around her back and sees me and removes it.  I brush it off again.  I walk up to him and start talking about sports and where he lives in the area and this time while talking he was acting a little nervous and got out of the convo pretty quick.  We talked earlier a little bit and he was not acting nervous/sketchy  but then i saw him with arm around her lower back.  To be fair, the arm could have been there for a minute or two or maybe a second or two; who knows.  


Now here is where gets concerning to me...  


 A bunch of us are inside all a little drunk and I am standing off to the side and out loud she goes ""thanks babe""  directing at male coworker and then sees me out of the corner of her eye and her face drops, male coworker is looking real concerned and i say ""thanks babe""? and she said ""ohhh thats just our thing""  and i look at him and he is just staring at me . (ive only heard her call me babe and her best female friends) She explains that male coworker has been calling his roommate babe all day so thats why she did it.  i understand that words slip out when drunk but not sure how thats ""their"" thing and they both looked a little surprised i was right there and heard it.    
  Like i said i have had trusting issues in past, I have been cheated on few times so this time i get  mad since I am starting to see these ""cheating signs"" occur for the 3rd time in an hour or so. Her calling him babe, the flirtatious or ""casual"" touching as she puts it.  I storm out of party and then her male coworker and friend leave because we told them too.  My gf said she is going too (she went  to our house)  and leaves forgetting her phone.  I did the shit-head move and decided to look into her phone at their texts.  A few little jokes and stuff, but she is talking to him like we did when we first met, not like saying babe, but with the little ways should we flirt with me and inside jokes (which is expected since they do work together) and poking fun at each other   
   I then see that she had actually invited him to the bar first (from paragraph above) and not her girlfriend that came first.  She had originally told me she invited girlfriend first then her hot male coworker for her girlfriend cause her girlfriend thought he was hot.  Why would she lie about inviting him for her, when that was clearly not the intention??? She also lied to me saying she didn't think he was hot, but clearly said it in text message and i showed her.  Her claim is I am taking it out context when it read as ""I invited my hot male coworker to come too"".   I then look at my gf's friend at the party and asked if they both left at same time the night all three of them went out  because male coworker was too drunk.  she said ""no i left before them, they stayed to hang out together for awhile longer"".  My gf told specifically her and her girlfriend left him alone at bar because he was way to drunk"".  


   I confronted the male coworker that night before he left, he did'nt really say yes or no to it, made some general statement before i stormed off again.  I Told my gf I know  she lied to me about male coworker twice about why she invited him to bar and then staying there until 1am with him.  She said it wasn't lying to me, she ""just told me half of the truth to keep me from getting mad or jealous"".  Then there was the way she acted when i asked about to learn more about him and she erupted in a defensive manner, the casual or flirtatious touching at the party, her referring to him as babe, then her lying to me about hanging out with him alone and lying about who she was really invited first.  She denies she invited him first and then when i said lets look at time stamps in phone she said she invited her gf so it wouldn't be awkward with just her and her male coworker.  


   Am i wrong for thinking there is something more going on here?  I know I've had jealousy issues in past and i confronted her about the situation and laid out all the facts about why i feel like something else is happening and showing all the coincidences.  she flipped out on me and started getting super defensive and giving me explanations like I don't remember his arm around me and i didnt say ""Babe was our thing""  and she never said he was hot (shower her phone to prove wrong) Once i found out about how she had previously lied i can't deny it, i don't trust her.  I don't necessarily thing they are banging but I do believe something happened with all the facts I laid out.....AND IT SUCKS!!  


   We are currently fighting, going to break up most likely because I don't know how she can prove all of these things don't mean anything, since she has never been like this with another guy besides me, which makes it very hard for me to trust her on this andmove forward.  There are way to many coincidences in my eyes for something not to be happening....right?    


   Am i wrong for breaking up with her over this? I do not want to at all, I love her to death, but all these  small instances have added up and I know she would never admit to something like this....

  
HELP!  
 

**TL;DR! GF of 4 years started talking to male coworker and had a bunch of suspicious coincidences occur such as lying to me twice around hanging out with him, calling him babe, touching and flirting in front of me and I need help to understand if I am in the wrong for believing something is happening.  I do not know how I can move forward with our relationship after this. woof.**"
"Break up with my (27/f) boyfriend (28/m) because he doesn’t make me a priority?


Hi folks!

I (27/f) please need your input on my situation. 
I have been dating my boyfriend (28) since May this year and so far I am quite happy. He is very attentive, gives me small gifts, planned an awesome birthday surprise for me, ... But there is one thing that makes me unhappy and that is that I don’t feel like a priority in his life. 
For example, I feel like he doesn’t make enough time for me. We live approximately 1,5 hours apart and normally spend the weekends with each other. But last weekend he went on a conference and this weekend he is going to spend with his family. I feel so hurt because he doesn’t even consider me in his plans and I rarely get to see him. 
My plan is to give him a two week break to see how life is without me and if he would prefer that over accommodating to my needs. What are your thoughts?

Thank you!

TLDR: Boyfriend does often not include me in his weekend planning. This hurts me. I thought about a relationship break."
"Dating a single mom for the first time... (34m, 28f)


I'm a mid-thirties man with no kids who got out of a 6 year relationship about a year and a half ago. I started dating again a few months back and met a late-twenties woman who I'm really crazy about. She's a single mom and I'm okay with that. I don't have much experience with kids but I'm willing to learn and work at it.

That being said..sometimes I feel she brings up her kids too much when she's on dates with me, or at awkward moments. I understand that's her priority in life but I don't necessarily need her showing me pics of her kids while we're laying in bed together naked. Or if we go into the city for a fun night out and somehow I get wrangled into walking through kids' clothing stores for hours. So many conversations get steered back to talking about her kids, and that makes me feel kinda weird. I haven't met her kids yet because she's extremely gaurded about them, so it have a hard time being interested in people I haven't even met.

I'm very willing to meet her kids when she's comfortable and I am willing to build a relationship/bond with them if and when our own relationship comes to that point. But I feel we need to focus on building a solid foundation between the two of us and keep the romantic times romantic. It makes me feel a little shitty when I go all out for a romantic evening (hotel suites, nice restaurant, etc.) and then the entire time is used to talk about her kids/ex/family/custody issues. 

Am I wrong to feel this way? Am I being an asshole?

TL;DR - Started dating a single mom who hits almost every mark on my perfect-partner checklist. I'm cool with the fact that she has kids but I still wish she would focus on our relationship when she's out with me rather than talk about her kids continuously. I don't mind becoming part of that life but I want to feel like she wants me in her life because she likes me as a man and not just because she needs someone to help support her kids."
"I (23/M) am having trouble convincing a beautiful woman (35/F) that life is worth living for.


So I know this isn't exactly a relationship but I dont know where else to post this. I met this really beautiful woman on reddit who is very gifted and poetic even in how she talks. She has been stricken with depression almost all of her life and I've tried to convince her that there is love all around her and that her life is so precious and it's worth living for. I havent heard from her for a couple of days and havent seen her online and it's really making me worried sick. Her last message to me was that she wished for me to separate any emotional ties I have linked to her as it will only result in hurt and that she is done for this life. I wish I could go to her and be there for her off the internet but I do not know her outside of reddit. I'm worried sick and I cant help but feel like she has taken her own life. It's making me depressed and I feel empty. I dont know what to do other than hope she is ok."
"I'm (M28) nterrested in a co-worker (F27)


So I started a new job one month ago and a co-worker and me are exchanging some looks and small talk (ongoing for a month). I think she is interrested in me, I know I'm curious about her. I think about her alot.

"I [18F] got involved with a new friend's [21M] life and now I'm losing connection with my close friend [22M]


Context - My close friend, (who we'll call) Jerry, first became friends with (who we'll call) Sam. Through the occasional times I'd join them on online games as 3, I became friends with Sam.

Fast forward a few months, we all meet up in real life. Long story short, Sam and I end up opening up to each other about our mental issues and became comfortable talking about that stuff. During that time, Sam also broke up with his girlfriend after having confessed to me.

Since then, I've been happy trying to help Sam through the times he's been feeling down and so he's become very dependent on me. For example, one way he feels better is by being in a discord call with me and no one else. However, the way it usually goes is I'm already in a call with Jerry and Sam messages me saying he needs me. I then feel inclined to leave Jerry and spend the rest of the night in a call with Sam. Although I ultimately want to help Sam, I'd be lying if I said I've never wanted to just stay in the call with Jerry. I don't really have that time with Jerry anymore and we both miss it. I spend a lot more time with Sam and, even though it's fun, my introverted traits also make it difficult being around Sam that much... I've often just ended up burnt out from being around him that much.

I'm aware it's selfish and I definitely feel bad about it. I don't want to throw him under the bus/make it his fault/make him a burden, none of that. I just want to help Sam but not lose the time with Jerry. Is it okay for me to feel worried about his dependency on me? Do I have to always ""choose""? I guess I'd like some advice on the situation and if there's a way I can help Sam but still have that time with Jerry.

I apologise if some things fail to make sense, I haven't fully thought out the situation myself.

tl;dr New friend is dependent on me and we spend a lot of time together (just us), time which used to be with an older close friend (just us). Is there a way to avoid ""choosing""?"

"I[25M] tried help my gf[26F] quit smoking in inappropriate way


My girlfriend is a smoker. She has smoked for 8 years. I didn't believe that stick with tobacco can't be so addictive. A few weeks ago said her I would smoke like you 2 months and we quit together. She advised against me but finally accepted my challenge and I have smoked with her from 1 September. I took my first cigarette from her and lightened up. When I finished the first cigarette with her inhale instruction I got used to smoke. In next day we went to shopping and girlfriend said ""We going on cigarette"" I said ""OK"". I took few appropriate drags and felt huge pleasure my opinion about smoking changed 180 degrees. After the week I very liked smoking sometimes pleased my girlfriend to smoking with me. Now I have the addiction, yesterday I bought my own pack and smoking alone in work. I should quit 1 November but I will not be able to. How tell her that I want continue smoking?

"How do I [29F] with chronic health problems tactfully deal with people who ask if I'm ""better yet?""


I ended a short friendship recently for my friend's being all over the place (flaking then getting mad and possessive about me hanging out with other friends, etc).

But I was at a loss with how to deal with some of her comments, and I want to know how to handle this in the future.

She wanted to go to an exercise class for our weekly get-together, and after trying out the class a couple of times and feeling awful after each time,  I realized it was not for me. (I have autoimmune problems: arthritis and Crohns, and the exercise class was making my joints hurt and making me have to run back home before I crapped my pants.)

I tried to explain to her tactfully what was going on.  But then she started asking me each day if I was ""better yet"" and could come to the exercise class. I kept trying to explain to her that my health issues are a lifetime thing, and we could hang out still but it would have to be less active.

The friendship kind of dissolved after that, and it was for the best, I think. But for the future, how can I explain my limitations more effectively to new friends? Or do you think it was less an issue of understanding and more a sign of a selfish friend with her wanting to do what she wanted to do, my health problems be damned?"

"10 Years ago I (31M) I had small relationship with my Gf's (28F) mom (56F), shes a terrible person and i have no idea how to deal with this.


Me and my GF have been in a relationship for nearly a year, im in love with her and I really dont want to break up with her, but i dont want to hide this from her, specially because i found out her mom is a terrible person. My GF is an immigrant, her parents moved back to their country after she reached adult age and she decided to stay behind because she grew up and loves it here, her parents are visiting on christmas and for the first time shes shown me pictures of them.



The problem is, 10 years ago, way before i met her, I had a thing for older woman in their 40's. (It changed when i started thinking of wanting a family, so although i still find them attractive, Id much rather stay with my girlfriend). Her mother is a terrible person, she was my college teacher and at the time i remember the sex being great and being completely head over heels for her. I was foolish and really believed we had something, the fact that she made me believe in it too only makes it worse, until later i found out she had an husband. I obviously got mad and wanted to tell him about the affair his wife was having, but she ended up blackmailing me, telling me i could be expelled from college because of something like this and it'd be better for both of us if it stayed a secret.


I have no idea how to approach this, shes still married to her husband, her daughter still loves her and misses her. I love my GF and definetly dont want to break up with her, but at the same time i dont want to keep this a secret from her.


TL;DR: I had a relationship 10 years ago with my GF's mother, she was my teacher and was having an affair. (I didn't know about her husband)"

"My [20sM] girlfriend [20sF] wants to get sushi with a wealthy divorced guy (40sM)


TLDR: Long distance gf wants to get dinner with successful rich guy. He knows its only as friends and that she has a bf. She wants to learn from his professional experience (which I get and would be interested in as well) and also get free sushi however, he is in his 40s, divorced, and was with an 18 year old after the breakup.  There's more to this so its worth the read. Sorry in advance for the novel.

&amp;#x200B;

So my \[20sM\] girlfriend \[20sf\] and I have been dating for almost 2 years.  We have 110% trust with each other and have a strong, communicative relationship.  We're really good at handling any disagreements and can talk through anything that comes up without getting emotional or upset.  We are going to be (continuing) long distance for the next 18 mo. as shes finishing up school (she's in the states and I'm working out of the country) until we can move in together.  So far this has worked well as she is busy with classes/work and I'm busy with work and we visit often enough. We are both very driven, hardworking, and love to learn (relevant).  To the surprise of her friends, I've never had a problem with her having other male friends and spending time with whoever she wants.

&amp;#x200B;

She went out the other night and met a really wealthy man \[40s\] \[owns a private jet wealthy\] who is friends with her friends she went out with. He lives in their small town. She told me how this guy loves to flaunt his wealth and still oddly hangs around their small town.  He is divorced and apparently dated an 18 year old after the break up even though he has a daughter whose in her early 20s.  They seem to get along well as friends according to her and he asked if she wanted to get together sometime because she ""caught his attention"" and ""wants to learn more about her"".  She said that she'd be interested but made sure that this guy knew that it was only as friends.  He confirmed and they have a tentative plan to get sushi for Thursday.  He and her friends were surprised that I would be okay with this.  They also said I was an idiot for leaving her (geographically not breaking up) to start my company...).  Caveat: Friends are surprised that I am okay with my girlfriend talking to guys at a party and even having male friends.  Now, if this were just some random guy friend from her school or someone who was valuable professionally, I'd have no problem with this at all.  But this guy is in his 40s and dated a younger girl and didn't mention a potential job/professional introductions/advice.  It sounds really off to me even though it was made clear that it wasn't a date. I trust everything she said including that she would never go behind my back or be interested in this guy.

&amp;#x200B;

She said that she's interested in learning about this guys story.  I admit, the guy's career path/business sounds interesting and tbh, I'd be interested in hearing more so I get why she's interested.  He also is taking her to sushi place which is her absolute favorite and a treat because it's not cheap. He talked about offering to fly her (and \*possibly\* me) to Europe for her study abroad nest semester in his private jet as well. This weirded both of us out and she said she'd never get on a plane with the guy alone/without me and we even joked about her bringing pepper spray if that happened.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm torn.  We've both always thought it's really fucked up for guys/girls to be controlling/jealous and limit social interactions and not let their SO have friends of the other sex.  We're extremely open with each other and she even offered to turn down the invitation if I'm uncomfortable.  I can't decide if this is something really weird about this (I know its weird but is it too weird?) and I should say it makes me uncomfortable or if it's not that big of a deal and I should be okay with her getting free sushi and getting to learn and build a platonic/professional(?) relationship with a successful/influential businessman even though he's probably interested in more.  

&amp;#x200B;

I absolutely trust that she would reject his advances if it happened but I can't help but feel he has an agenda and is trying to sleep with her.  If this is the case, is that okay? Should I tell her I'm uncomfortable with her meeting him?"
"Is it normal that I (20F) am both simultaneously enraged and aroused by the thought of having a threesome with my boyfriend? (22M)


My boyfriend and I have been living together about three years. I love him to death, we work pretty well together and don’t have too many problems. I admittedly can sometimes be on the jealous/possessive side. I get annoyed even when he is talking to another girl or just texting a female classmate. I am fully aware that these feelings are unhealthy and they stem from my own insecurities. He has never cheated on me or anything close to it. I am consciously working on my own self confidence so that I can grow out of my petty feelings of jealousy. 

Anyways, lately I’ve started to realize that I am sexually attracted to women. I would love to engage with them more often. As these feelings have grown, I’ve thought about having a threesome with my boyfriend. In the past, this would be an idea I would have vehemently rejected. I still kind of do, because I have very strong feelings about loyalty and I would HATE to see my boyfriend be intimate with someone else. At the same time, I am so aroused by the thought of having sex with him and another girl. I fantasize about it all the time. Is this normal? Does anyone else have feelings like this?

TL;DR I fantasize about having a two girl threesome with my boyfriend but I am also the jealous type so I have very mixed feelings. "
"Not sure if my boyfriend (m23) wants to marry me (f22) or not.


TLDR: I’m not sure if my boyfriend wants to marry me or not even after he said he did. 

So, my boyfriend and I have been together for over 5 years now. The last time we got into a significant fight, where I was super upset, he mentioned that he was planning on asking me to marry him at an upcoming concert we were going to. The date came and went, and nothing. I tried not to be too disappointed, I figured it was probably because it got ruined from him telling me beforehand. But now it’s been over 6 months from then, and he completely dodges it whenever I bring up anything regarding rings or engagement stuff, and he’ll change the subject. I don’t bring it up that often, I don’t want to scare him off, and I don’t want him to think I’m desperate either, because I’m not. I’m just disappointed because I thought he would have done it by now. It’s hard not to feel a little bitter when he changes the topic every damn time, and I almost feel like he just told me he was going to ask me because he knows that’s what I want, and he didn’t want me to leave him. I don’t want to give him an ultimatum, but if he doesn’t want to be married to me, should I even stay? I’m starting to get anxious about it, especially since I won’t be seeing him much when my second semester of nursing school starts. I’ll only see him in the morning before class, after 10 pm when I get off work, and on my weekends off. I really wanted to be engaged before then to make myself feel better about not spending as much time together. I love him so much, and I just want a promise that I can be his forever. I don’t even want an expensive ring, I found a really pretty one at Walmart for under 100$. I know he loves me, he tells me all the time, and he takes care of me when I need it without me having to ask. He knows that while I want a promise, I don’t want to get married right away. I want to finish school and be able to pay for a wedding without help from either of our parents. I have no idea how to bring this up to him without crying. I’ve told him all about how I just want a ring, not a wedding right away, but I find it really hard to straight up ask him if he still wants to ask me. "

"I [25 M] am uncertain about a friend [27 F]. I think she is avoiding me. We only know each other for a year.


Well, I am friends for almost a year with that particular girl. My father had an accident and is now a cripple. Her mother experienced the same, so we bond over this. Overall it was a pretty shitty year for me. But my friend pulled through. Invited me over to every stuff and so. She has other and better friends though. She was now for a few months in another country and returned. Obviously I missed her, and try to reconnect, but she barely takes her time anymore. When we spend most of our free time together. I yet have to see her more than 2 hours in this month since she returned. She making plans with other people, where I was usually invited too. Some days after her birthday I wanted to invite her for dinner and drinking and clubbing, she refused because she said she has way too much work for university to do for the next 2 weeks. Though she still went partying twice this week alone.
When she texted me usually several times a day, she now takes a lot of time to respond, despite beeing often on her phone or doesnt answer at all.

We had our issues, but I really like her a lot and try to show it everytime possible. I think the best part about her is, that we usually talk things out, unlike most other girls I am friends with.

When I confronted her about the changes in our friendship, whether something is wrong. She said everything is fine, and I shouldnt worry. She is just busy, and also doesnt want to explain herself for who she spends time with and when.
Am I losing a great friendship? Am I just a jealous kid. I dont know. I feel like I cant offer her anything not anybody can do. I am very insecure and fear the worst, despite her words, I feel like something is up.

tldr: good female friend returned from another country. Even though we spend a lot of time earlier together she barely seems to find time for me. Even though she seems to be around with everybody else."
"Should I [27/F] swallow my pride and apologize to my boyfriend [28/M] right now?


Hi everyone.

I \[27/F\] just got into an argument with my boyfriend \[28/M\] and I'm legitimately confused about how to proceed. I like listening to people from multiple perspectives, so I need you input on how you'd handle this situation if you were me regarding swallowing my pride and apologizing right now, or holding off and wait for him to reach out to me first.

My boyfriend likes to stay in a lot, and I've been trying to get him to get out of his apartment. I want to switch things up from our normal routine and be outside with the world.

**The following is our text exchange:**

Him: We can watch a movie?

Me: You're gonna get bored of me if we do the same routine over and over

Him: Not at all. It doesn't matter what we do as long as I'm with you. Do you mean you're gonna get bored of me?

Me: No but it would be nice if we did stuff outside of your apartment once in a while.

Him: See. You never say what you mean. You always twist it and make it sound like it's from me somehow. Didn't we both agree that we wanted to chill at home this weekend?

Me: I know and you're right about that. I'm just speaking in broad, general terms. I'm not in the best condition right now, so I agree that we should take it easy this weekend, but I'm just saying in general. It seems like you like to stay in a lot, even if it means ordering food and taking it home or postmating food to eat it at home.

Him: Didn't we just go out to eat yesterday and go to the concert last week?

Me: As much as I like to stay in, I prefer to get out in the world with you occasionally. Keeps things interesting.

Him: Wtf?

Me: Why are you getting defensive

Him: You're literally saying everything I was saying on the way to work yesterday. I'm the one who was saying all of these things when I said we should make a bucket list to make sure we do things to keep things interesting

Me: Yes I agree... Fuckkkk...

Him: Wtf (insert my name)

Me: Yeah seriously wtf (his name)

Him: You're so full of shit.

Me: Ok then. I'm full of shit so I'm gonna stop talking until you learn to speak to me respectfully. I don't talk to you like that and I'm not gonna let you speak to me that way. I'm out.

Him: Yes please take some time to think about things rationally and come back when you can respect me. I want you to go back and see where this conversation turned for the worse and see how you should have done things differently. This was so ridiculous and unnecessary.

Did I go ""wrong"" when I said the word ""fuck"" out of frustration? I don't want to apologize right now, because I'm not happy about what he said and I don't want him to think it's okay.

TL;DR\*\* - My boyfriend and I fought about me wanting to get out of the apartment more. I'm not sure where I went wrong in the conversation and I don't know how to approach the next step, because I feel like my pride is keeping me from apologizing."
"M (24) had a crush on another girl in his relationship with me F(21)?


Hey guys.
So I found out this week that my partner who I love so incredibly much had a crush on a coworker when they first started working with them around 5 to 6 months ago. According to my partner, they were just physically attracted to the coworker but once they became friends this crush faded and the feelings were only friendly. 

I know this is minor, but I feel so sad about it. I feel so self conscious and that I am not good enough compared to this girl. I know these feelings probably stem from low self esteem and I can recognize that. My partner is aware that I am hurt, I just want to know how I can get over it because right now, I am so upset.

Tl;dr: partner had small crush around 5 months ago, I just found out about it now, and I feel hurt and want to know how to get over it."

"I [21F] hooked up with a mutual guy friend of my ex [22M] keep it a secret or be honest?


Backstory: My ex and I broke up about 5 months ago and it ended really poorly (3 yr relationship) We don't talk except occasionally to argue or me acting very stupid and trying to keep contacting him. 
--
I had a date night/formal and didn't have anyone to take so just asked one of my guy friends who is also very close to my ex. (My ex graduated so he's no longer on campus). My ex was very apprehensive about me going with a mutual friend because he gets very jealous even though we're broken up though i do understand the boundaries of having respect for each other. 
I was extremely drunk after the formal and my friend and I went back to his apartment and we were hanging out and just talking. We eventually hooked up although i don't remember much of the night.

I felt extremely guilty the day afterward and talked with the friend. He told me not to tell anyone and to never tell my ex. I agreed seeming that it's better for everyone this way. It kills me inside that this happened and is weighing heavily on me. I think its better to not say anything but my guilt is pressing me. Moreover.. this mutual friend is showing his true colors and is very much betraying my ex. They had a conversation prior in which my ex told him not to pull any moves on me and then made him promise to tell him if anything had happened..

What is best for this situation? Just keep it silent and move forward? Or be honest?

TLDR: Hooked up with a mutual friend of an ex.. mutual friend promised my ex to tell him if anything were to happen but is now lying to my ex and now i feel extremely guilty.

"My (20F) mother (43F) might be projecting her own body issues on to me and it's making my anxiety worse


I am a 20 year old university student and I still live at home. I've always had a weight issue, never overweight or obese but always at the higher end of the ""normal"" range on the BMI. I also have depression, anxiety and hypothyroidism and all three of these disorders have been diagnosed within the last two years or less. I am on medication for them. 

My mother, who I have a close relationship with, has always had a weight issue too. She is definitely overweight but not obese and more recently she has become more aware of this and trying to better herself. She also has hypothyroidism. 

We are going back to visit our extended family to our home country and let's just say that the society there could definitely use a lesson of politeness and being tactful. Especially my grandmother. They say what's on their mind and what they're thinking unfiltered and sometimes it can be really really hurtful. We have about two months before we go back to visit. 

My mother has been trying to be healthier for herself and I think more so because she's going back and she feels really bad about how she looks.  She has lost some already and has a good mindset but she is very straightforward about how much she hated her body and how she looks. I always remind her that your size isn't the most important thing but she says she knows that she doesn't hate herself but only how she looks. 


I've been trying to get better and healthier too and because I'm gluten intolerant, I tend to retain a lot of water and have terrible IBS so I have to be really picky about what I eat. I've started intermittent fasting and it actually is working. I have visibly slimmed and I lost weight because certain clothes fit much better and my muffin top has been diminishing and I'm actually happy with how it's going. I eat in a 6 hour window and then don't eat for 18 hours and this really works with me schedule because I'm pre-med and I have 7-8 hours of classes every day. I have a window to eat between classes and a snack for later on in the day. I have been having midterms for three weeks and haven't got the time to go to the gym but I try to work out a couple times a week with HIIT circuits and planning to do more from this week since exams are over. 

My mom has been happy with my progress and mentioned how I should keep going but my dad is  less understanding. He thinks if I don't eat breakfast or have an egg and a banana and a glass of milk (I'm completely lactose and casein intolerant btw and he still doesn't understand that properly) it means I'm starving myself. I don't know what actually happened but tonight (weekend) I came home from volunteering and working on a term paper pretty late (around 8 pm). I only had some food in the morning around 11:30 am and had a small snack and a cup of coffee at school. After, I went to eat some rice around 9:30 pm and my mom was on the phone with my dad and she turns around and screams at me to take less rice. It was only two scoops and not even that much and today was my cheat day. Like the amount of food I had today is significantly more than I have the other 6 days. My dad started laughing on the phone and I felt so so humiliated and like a fat monster that I put all the rice back in the cooker and went to my room. I'm usually not that disrespectful at all. But from this summer, every single day I hear about how I got really fat and I have to lose weight. On top of my depression and anxiety and a super stressful school life, this thing is making me really stressed. 

My mom came stomping to my room and passive aggressively told me to go and eat and that from this day on she will NEVER say anything about my health to me ever again. She doesn't care if I'm growing out of every side, if I eat 10 times a day or I starve myself (this is her verbatim) she doesn't give a fuck and this is my life and my body and if I don't care about it she doesn't either and she's not putting any pressure on me. 
Then she goes on about how she's the mother and she still has to cook and clean for us which makes her not have time for herself to workout and diet but she doesn't care about my health and me eating at 10 pm at night and then going to bed immediately isn't even something she cares about anymore. I wasn't going to bed immediately. 
Then she went on and on about how I have to do my own dishes (already do and anytime there is any dishes in the sink, doesn't matter who's), clean my room and the general house ( I already ALSO do that. My sister and father don't do jack shit). And on and on she went. 

It was so confusing and humiliating what she was talking about because it seemed like she was jumping from thing to thing. What's worse is that this came out of nowhere. We were literally just talking about some new bags she got as presents like half an hour before the incident and she commented on how I had lost weight and how I should keep it up. 

I really think she's projecting her own insecurities on me. On the one hand she wants me to be healthy and lose weight and on the other hand, she wants me to eat meals and doesn't understand that this isn't a quick fix and that I'm already losing weight and I intend to keep going for my own sake. 

I really don't know. My relationship with food is increasingly becoming unhealthy and I experience so much anxiety when I start getting hungry. 

I don't know what to do. 

Tl;dr: Mother exploded about food. Possibly projecting own body issues on daughter. What can be done in a delicate manner? "
"My (23f) boyfriend (26m) and I have been together for 3 years, but I don’t know if I’m happy anymore


People say that once this feeling hits you, it’s a sign to end the relationship. I don’t believe this because I struggle with depression and have abandonment issues. I think about losing my boyfriend every day. 

He is an amazing guy who I can truly be myself around. He’s my best friend, but things just aren’t the same anymore. 

About 9 months ago, we moved across the country for his job and that’s when things began to change. He started working non stop and because of that, has given us less time to spend together. We barley talk during the week, Friday night and Saturday he’ll give me his undivided attention, but Sunday he’ll watch football all day and there’s no distracting him. 

We’ve gotten in a lot of arguments lately and sex has been non existent since we moved here as well. I’ve been feeling very alone and not as important to him as before. We have talked about working on our relationship, but he has done nothing to fix this failing relationship. 

I have adjusted to his busy schedule and give him his space when he works. I always always say thank you for the things he does and show my appreciation for him, I cook dinner for him so it’s ready by the time he gets home from work...I do a lot and don’t feel appreciated for any of it. 

We agreed to both read the 5 love languages by Gary Chapman. But he has not touched the book since we got them 3 weeks ago and I’m halfway through it. 

He’ll continue to say that he cares about our relationship and loves me, but I never see him do anything to help improve our relationship. He’s laying on the couch watching football right now as I write this and I tried making conversation with him, but it’s all one word responses and monotone. He has a tone in voice like he doesn’t want me to distract him. 

I just don’t know if I’m happy anymore and it’s hard for me to leave because home is on the other side of the country. I do love him with all my heart and I would do anything to go back to the way we were back when he had more time and was working his previous job. He said that this won’t be for forever. He is at the peak of his career right now and I totally understand that and support him, but that makes me the second priority and I don’t know if I like that. I’m too young to be feeling this way every day. 

Tl:dr 
In a long term relationship, recently moved across the country together for his job, but since then we’ve been having a lot of issues in our relationship. We’ve talked about what we need to do to fix our failing relationship. I’ve done my part, but he has done his. He is at the peak of his career and I support that, but I don’t know if I can continue to feel unimportant "
"I[21M] met someone[19F] and our first date was like 10 years of marrige in a 24 hour period.


A few days ago I[21M] met a girl[19F] on tinder. We talked for a while and then set a date. But the day of the date she had to cancel because a friend of hers was really sick and she had to go help her. I said okay and we set another date for the following day. The next day, I wrote to her to confirm time and place but she said she wasn’t feeling okay and kind of ignored me. Now, I’m on tinder to mostly hook up but this girl, even only talking over the phone, just had a different energy which made me really wanna meet her, no matter how the date would end. So after she ignored me I made a different plan for my day and went on with it but the way she spoke in the morning was really bugging me so I texted her, saying I was very confused if she really was that sick or if she just didn’t want to meet me etc. She said she was actually feeling terrible and didn’t even have enough energy to pick up the phone. Knowing that she lives alone I asked if there was anyone there to help her and she said no. My place is pretty close to hers so I offered to come over and help with things. She said okay. So at around midnight I went to her place. She seemed to be feeling a lot better and it was clear that she was sick. 

It was a really weird first date. First, we laid on the bed looking at stuff on the internet then somehow we starting cuddling together and kept talking until 6 am. Then we both went to sleep, also still cuddling.

Our conversations consisted of very private matters. It wasn’t like a first date at all. It was like we had known each other and been together for so long that we got tired of having sex so we’d just cuddle and talk instead.

In the morning it was still the same. The problem started when I wanted go smoke. She is strongly against smoking and I’m a constant smoker. In the night before I didn’t really mind not smoking but after going to sleep and waking up I couldn’t resist the urge to smoke. 

Since It was a sunday we went back to bed. She said something not so unpleasant, regarding me being a smoker, to which I reacted with a cold attitude, drew my arm back from her neck and kind of started frowning for some reason. She said what I’m doing was very immature and I mentioned a past relationship I had as an answer and she also found that answer to be immature as well. 

Now I can’t go into dept for what was said exactly, because I don’t really remember them well. Those reactions I had were not strict, they were just random, cranky reactions, which is why I can’t remember exactly.

So after that, she started acting weird and after a while she said we went into this way too quickly, before having any idea about each other. And she said that she actually found me to be not mature enough as she thought i was. She then added we probably wouldn’t have any future relations.

When I first came to her place she was very sick, fragile and unguarded. I guess how the night went wasn’t because of what we felt towards each other but because what we needed in our times of loneliness. One might even say I took adventage of her state at the time. Then again, it was just some warm cuddling. Shame though I really liked her...

I guess this is the reason why a first date at a coffee shop is necessary. 


TL;DR: I met someone I like and I was found to be immature by that person. It ended bad although it all went great for the longer period."

Before, it led to fights and arguments but since we both figured it must have been symptoms, I tried to hold back. I know it’s difficult for him and I’m really proud of how far he has gone. I want to be emotionally stable for him. But as someone who recently just got out of counselling, I barely started becoming emotionally stable. I’m trying my best not to take what he says to heart but it’s difficult. I’m trying to just be there for him and not mirror back his emotions. Sometimes I want to cave into my hole and just want to be alone but I don’t want to do that to him. 

I want to rant about work or school, how his symptoms is affecting me but I don’t want to agitate him further. So I just hold it back and cry it off to sleep. He’s a great guy and past few weeks, he wasn’t showing these but lately it’s getting pretty often. Being emotionally stable right now especially with stress looming in, I don’t know how long I can take it before I break down again. But I think this time, I won’t do it in front of him.

"My [41f] son [18m] has drifted into a life of vice, and I need some help


So, I live in Florida. My husband divorced me 15 years ago and I got full custody of my son. He recently moved out, despite my best efforts to keep him with me, and went to a college in Alaska.

This was troublesome, as I would prefer, if he absolutely had to move out, that it would only be a short drive, as I would like to visit him weekly at least to check up on him and continue to do a mother's duties. As is, I can only visit him once a year, and I have to spend all of my vacation days at work to do so.

Despite this, I visited him for two weeks last September and what I found shocked and horrified me to my very core.

Firstly, he seemed shocked to see me. I thought nothing of it, as he lived far away, and his mommy caring enough to visit him might come as a bit of a shock to the mind of a child such as him who has never had the absolute joy of a child of their own.

Secondly, he told me he had a girlfriend. I was now the one who was shocked, as 18 is too young an age for a boy to date at. However, I decided to give his ""girlfriend"" the benefit of the doubt.

Then I met her. She was 19 years old, making her *older* than my son. As if that wasn't enough, she dressed like a whore, wearing jeans and a shirt instead of a dress, as a lady should.

Then, I found out she was a communist. She claimed she wasn't, but she was a godless Russkie, so I knew she was lying, as Russkies follow the father of lies, and everyone knows that all Russkies are commies to the core. She then spun some more deceits, no doubt intended to keep my son entrapped by her wicked ways, about how Alaska was a colony of the Russians before some ""Russian Revolution"" (no doubt another deceit, and a blatant ripoff of our glorious American Revolution, for Russkies lack creativity of any kind), and that her family had lived in Alaska since before Alaska belonged to America (another deception, I am sure, as Russkies are not Indian Savages, and, indeed, it would be an insult to the Indians to compare the two).

It was at this point that I truly feared for my son, as I would rather him date a negro or Chinawoman, or even, god forbid, an illegal or a towel-head than a communist.

I voiced my concerns several times, but he refused to listen. He even threatened to kick me out, a threat that I foolishly believed to be empty.

Then, I caught him listening to Elton John on the radio while we were going to the grocery store. Elton John is a homosexual rock musician known for being proud of his debauched, sinful lifestyle, which is a slick in the face of god and promotes the fiery pits of hell.

He didn't even have the decency to act ashamed when I caught him, instead claiming that *I* was the unreasonable one. I fear his communist whore ""girlfriend"" and sinful, atheistic leftist college professors have corrupted him despite my best efforts to raise him right and true to the word of God.

It only took four days before the toxic whisperings of his disgusting, debauched Russkie whore of his girlfriend got to his head and he kicked me out, telling me not to come back and to leave him alone.

I've tried emailing, calling, and writing letters to him, but it is absolutely no use. He has embraced his life of debauchery under the shadow of the great deceiver, and I fear I may have lost him.

But I have not given hope yet, for the spirit is greater than the devil, and he has given me the strength and will to persevere. However, I cannot do so without help. I need advice on how to bring my son back to the light and discipline him for the debauchery he engaged in in my absence.

TL;DR my son moved out and has been corrupted into a life of debauchery and vice, and I need help bringing him back into the light."

I really do love my girlfriend [24F], she’s a wonderful person. We’ve been together almost 2 years now (this is my first long term relationship). But I feel like i’m tearing myself apart inside. I’m so conflicted on whether or not this is right for me and for us. As with every couple we have our problems, but sometimes I worry ours are unhealthy. This is the worst it’s been so far and it feels really hard to prevent this downward spiral.

Lately we’ve been drifting apart more and more. I just feel like it’s so hard for me to be present and feel the same love that I used to. When I do start to feel it, it seems like everytime something sets me off or we just bicker about something and the feeling washes away.

She tells me that i’m not as sensitive as I used to be and that i’m not the same guy she fell in love with and that i’ve gotten mean. She’s not wrong I definitely get more upset than I used to and I can be less understanding than I used to be. I’ve definitely changed. She wants me to give her more attention and love, and I try. Sometimes it’s hard though, i have a lot going on between hobbies I want to explore, things I want to learn, work, and everything else in between. Sometimes I just need to escape and not feel like someone is relying on me. Even when I do feel like I make an effort to be more loving and caring though it feels like we either slip back to old patterns or I just don’t do enough. I feel like I try to make an effort to give a sustainable (for me) amount of care and affection so that I can balance my life, but it never feels like it’s enough. I’ve tried to find hobbies and thing we can get into together, but she never really wants to try or doesn’t seem to show interest.

I also can’t help but feel like i’m young and need to meet other people and experience new things before settling down. It feels so wrong that I wonder what other women are like and if I could find someone that fits me better. Maybe i’m just scared of committing i’m not really sure. But it feels like i’m locked in to something and the thought of it being permanent is scary. I fear that our interests and passions don’t line up and that she may be too scared to try new things and take chances like i’m willing to (i’ve brought this up but she doesn’t agree)

The thought of breaking up terrifies me because losing her and alienating her is scary. I don’t want her to hate me or resent me or think i’m a bad person. but i’m also scared that staying together will just continue to make us both unhappy. I feel trapped and like neither option is a good one at the moment.

I’ve wondered if maybe it’s resentment built up from the guilt I feel when she gets upset or when I do something that I feel like she doesn’t want me to. There’s definitely resentment there.

I just feel paralyzed and i’m not sure what to do about it. I don’t know what’s right and what’s wrong. I’m not entirely sure what I want but I can’t seem to choose between the two so i’m stuck in limbo not making an effort in either direction.

Yesterday she said she’s going to start looking for her own place after the holidays, so it seems like she’s deciding that unless things get better she’s going to move out and we’ll see from there.

I guess my question is, is it normal that i’m feeling this way? Am I at fault for feeling like it’s really hard to be or do “enough”? What can I make of all these feelings and all these conflicts?"
"I (22f) think I've found the love of my life but am worried about having to move outta the country without him(22m)


I'm a 22f and have been dating my boyfriend for about 6months (were friends for longer before that). My relationship with him has been nothing like I've ever experienced before. He has shown me a way to be loved that I'd never imagined before. We have great communication, admiration and respect for each other.
In my family the general expected path of life has always been to study abroad and finally settle down abroad as well as the ""quality of life and opportunities are better outside our country"" ( paraphrasing my parents). My sister will be moving to Canada soon, my cousin's are in America etc.
At one point in my life I too knew the career I wanted to pursue has better growth and opportunities elsewhere and not here. 
But ever since I found this lovely man, I've been wondering if leaving the country is the only way. A part of me feels pressured into having to leave the country because that's expectation from my family. They keep pushing me to follow my sister soon after she's settled.
My parents are Indian and it's not uncommon to hide your relationships for Indian parents. They don't know about my boyfriend let alone how serious we are. I can't bring myself to ever tell them ""hey have you considered I might want to stay here and work here because I have this person I see a future with"". 

Another part of me is kind of excited to see the world outside this country and I don't want to regret never having left. 

Some might ask why my boyfriend can't come with me instead of me having to stay here. He is in a band and they all live here and are trying to make it big. For him to come with me would mean to leave everything behind and start anew. We haven't really talked about it very much because it makes us so sad and uncomfortable to even think about.
I am so happy with him and everyday we learn and grow together. But this issue is causing me so much underlying stress. I don't know what to do.
I still have a year or two before my parents really start to rain down on me on applying for a master's ( even when im not sure what I want to study yet! But that's a whole other thing....) And following my sister's steps.
My family has been fairly non-confrontational our whole life and I dread fighting them on this.

I also worry about regretting whatever decision I end up making. I want to see the world but...I can't give up this relationship. 

(Sorry about this next part being a sort of irrelevant sounding rant but I feel it's important for context : 
Another aspect of this whole situation is, I'm FINALLY moving out of my parents. For the first time I get to live independently and make my own decisions. My sister went away for college, and worked abroad. She's pretty much lived away from our parents her whole adult life. Me? Not so much. I finally feel like I can do the things I want and learn how to adult and have some agency in my life because I finally get to move out in a couple of months. I can have the freedom to have the kind of relationship I want with my partner (things as simple as having a nice dinner together, or hanging out without having to lie or hide,  which I couldn't before because my parents are fairly strict about going out alot and specially at night (they ask me to put my google location on for ""safety"" reasons when I'm out, I'm sure when I move away they're going to ask me to leave the location tracker on perpetually ..and again if I fight back they just say for ""safety"" reason. This makes meeting my boyfriend really stressful).
I finally get to experience some independence away from them, but I feel like it's all overshadowed by this impending doom of a decision they are going to force me to make. )


All this is causing me a lot sadness and worry even though there isn't anything to worry about just yet but I know it's a road were going to have to cross eventually."

"I (32/f) may have to chose between my boyfriend (35/m) dream and taking care of my family


Four years ago, my boyfriend’s business was starting to really taking off. 

Since he’s able to work remotely, he wants to move to Montenegro. I on other hand wasn’t too comfortable with how abruptly he wanted to move over there.

He want to move there so badly that we nearly broke up over this.

The compromises was we have to take it slow and set things up so everything will work out. I laid down ground works and everything. 

We have spent quite a bit time there and even began to looks at some places last summer. 

We both are quite excited about it. I know this is what my boyfriend wants since he was in late teens and have been bent on making it happen and dedicated his whole life to making it happen.

So I was quite happy to be part of the whole thing.

Unfortunately, I have been in close contact with my family a lot because my grandfather passed away about half a year ago. My grandmother isn’t going well and my uncle isn’t able to do a good job taking care of her. My mom is too busy as she have a demanding stressful job. My brother have a young family of his own and my sister is currently in college and working full time. 

It pretty much fall onto me to take my grandmother in.

It was very difficult and painful to tell my boyfriend this. 

He was furious and upset. His younger brother was severely disabled which pretty much took away almost all of his mothers attentions. So he grew up most of his life feeling like his mother doesn’t love him. This led him to barely talk to her.

So the news really doesn’t fly well with him.

He keep saying he’s not going to end his dream to spend his life with a care taker who neglect him.

I’m so heartbroken. I have been with my boyfriend for six years. We have never had problem this bad.

What can we do to fix this?

Tldr; Made boyfriend wait to make his dream happen. Now I have to ask him to give up on it."

"My [24F] boyfriend [24M] of 1 yr swipes around on dating apps for fun.


About a month into our dating, I deleted Tinder and I assumed he did too but he didn't. He has a phone that can hold 128gb of storage so he really never deletes any apps. I can understand that. But he still likes to open and swipe for fun on dating apps. He says that ""it's fun"" even though I've said people don't do this kind of thing and that it's misleading to people on the app. I even asked him if he would want me to ""swipe for fun"" and he said if I wanted to I could. 

He never gets matches though, literally none (he's shown me his Tinder) and even after I've voiced my opinions on this a couple of times now, it doesn't seem like he gets it. He's a very sweet, caring, and loving person but this one thing just makes me doubt how committed he is to us. 

Is this a problem? Should I do anything?

tldr: BF swipes around on dating apps even though I said he shouldn't."
"The shittiest friend



Let me give you some context about this friend before I tell you what happened. This (now ex) friend (21F) has a permenant condition that doesn’t affect her life too much now, but will cause her to die younger than most. Unfortunately all the attention she gets from her illness (since she was a child) has made her an extremely self centered and selfish person. For example, her birthday is coming up, and instead of letting a friend arrange plans, she created a group chat titled “my birthday” with an picture of herself as the icon and told everyone what she wanted to do.

I (21F) have known her for about three years now. We met freshman year in college. We got closer toward the end of the year and she (along with my roommate (21F)) met my boyfriend (29M) and we all got together in a group setting twice (over freshman and sophomore year). Fast forward to last year (junior year). Neither of us are really friends with the roommate but she continues to befriend me and my boyfriend. At some point she created a group chat with just the three of us. All seemed innocent for a while but around May I began to get suspicious. She wanted for all three of us to go out and celebrate since I had done well on an important exam. While planning this I realized she was texting my boyfriend outside of the group chat, which is kind of weird and unnecessary since the plans were for all three of us. She said that she wanted to surprise me so I decided to forget about it. When we went to dinner she was acting kind of strange but nothing too overt. She did sit next to my boyfriend which I found distasteful but again did not do anything overt. I kind of forgot about her shady behavior after that and we continued to be friends. She would also text my boyfriend and I in the group chat from time to time. Then a few weeks ago my boyfriend randomly asked if he could delete the group chat since he didn’t care about her and didn’t want to be friends with her anymore. I asked why but he didn’t give a reason. I said he isn’t obligated to be friends with her and can do what he want. Fast forward to tonight when I see her birthday group chat and bitch to my boyfriend about how self centered she is and how I don’t want to go to her stupid party or whatever. He said well yeah you probably shouldn’t go and the proceeded to tell me everything she did. She contacted him late at night this past summer and he immediately turned her down. She then texted him again late at night and he again turned her down. Maybe she was drunk but that’s still no excuse to go after your supposed friend’s long term boyfriend. And then if that wasn’t enough, she called him during the day after those two attempts. When he did not answer she texted him saying let’s hang out.

Honestly she is just a shit person and my instincts last spring were right and I should have cut her off or at least told her off then. I really really want to yell at her and tell her what a shit person is but I don’t want to deal with all the blowback. She will likely text my boyfriend like a wounded puppy asking why he didn’t keep it a secret (as if he has some kind of obligation to her) and my boyfriend doesn’t want to deal with her and her drama anymore which I understand. We agreed that the best course of action would be for me to gradually ghost her but something in me really wants to just fucking tear her a new one. I know I should keep things civil to minimize the drama though. Just wanted to warn you guys how shitty people are and to be careful who you chose as friends.

TLDR: my shitty self centered friend tried to get with my long term boyfriend on three separate occasions."
"My boyfriend [24M] told me [23F] something and now I’m worried


So me and my boyfriend have been together for almost a year now. The other night he told me something that I haven’t been able to stop thinking about. We were talking about sexual stuff because we’re considering bringing another person in the bedroom just to see what it’s like. Both of us want to do this. Although he told me in the middle of the conversation that he let a guy give him a blowjob before. I thought he was kidding at first but no he was actually serious. He said that it was at some party and the guy was bisexual so he was pushing my boyfriend to try and he said yes. My boyfriend said it lasted about 30 seconds because he just couldn’t get hard which makes me feel a little bit better (i guess?) but still really not something I expected from him. He says it didn’t turn him on in any way and he’d never do it again. I keep thinking about it and it doesn’t make sense as to why a straight guy would let another guy suck his dick. Even just to “try it” is very odd to me. I’d never be interested in doing anything with a girl because I’m straight and I don’t feel unsure about it. It just makes me question his sexuality. I should mention this happened a long time ago, I didn’t ask exactly when but I’m assuming it had to be when he was in high school. I have no judgement against bi/trans/gay people I just think he may not be straight like he tells me he is and I’m worried about it. I wish I had an idea on what I should do or how to talk to him about it. Maybe I’m making a bigger deal than it really is. 

Tl;dr: My boyfriend let another guy give him a bj and I’m worried about it "
"I'm freaking out and don't want to go home


I fucked up. Royally fucked up. 

I spent a lot of money recently on work wear for an upcoming change in career. Like, almost $2000. We're on a strict budget because we're struggling, and I've tried to pay the credit card (in my name, but visible on our joint banking page) quietly over the course of the last two weeks.  I had some extra cash because a friend overpayed me for a monthly bill we have scheduled between us, and told me to keep the extra money for his December payment.  It still wasn't enough, and I have a big balance on the card I hoped my husband wouldn't see until I took care of it later this month. 

Well . . . .He noticed, and just called me FUMING while I was out running errands. I apologized, and he yelled at me. Fighting words, like ""this goes against what we are working for,"" etc. I get it, I shouldn't have done it. I signed up for an app where clicking and buying became almost game-like, and I was getting really good deals on nice stuff. I was feeling really excited and proud of the stuff I was getting, because it felt like all that searching and scrolling was productive, especially as I am really nervous about this career change. I wanted to look my best. 

I know these are rationalizations. I lied by omission, and he was really angry about that. (I told him I spent $500 as he counted the packages).  I'm still at the cafe, and feel like crying and can't get back into my work. I know I fucked up, but I""m scared to go home. Things have been rocky (job stuff, family stuff)  and now I'm worried he hates me. Getting Banana Republic suits at 80% is still too much for our tiny monthly budget right now, and I feel really stupid. I mean, I'm not an idiot, I get it was too much and money is a really sensitive topic right now, but I feel really insecure about my body and position in life and felt I was buying ""armor"" to start a really cool (and fairly lucrative, as in, I was going to pay much of this off after my first paycheck) opportunity. What the hell should I do now? Returning the items are not possible, as they are all used and sold by individuals. Please don't tell me off, I assure you my negative self talk is ripping me to shreds already. 

&amp;#x200B;

TL/DR: I spent too much money, boyfriend yelled at me, and am scared to go home. I don't know how to fix this, other than promise to never buy things again.

"My gf (18F) and me (17M) have been dating for a couple months now and this month she's really silent and never text or messages me anymore. Could it be that she doesn't feel interested in me anymore?


So we actually met on Reddit and things went really well we connected super fast and within less than a week started dating but later on i found out she started dating me with a lot of doubt in our success and already had backup guys to go out with. This completely disturbed as when i fell in love with her she was like my world completely, maybe I'm a fool sense she's my 2nd SO and first gf but I've been confident in my feelings for her since day one and to make it worse i also discovered she doesn't talk to her friends about me or tells anyone she's taken. If a guy flirts with her she'll ""feel bad for shutting them down "" so instead will flirt back or kinda play it off but never actually shutting them down, leaving a window open ya know? This really got to me and i cried about it for awhile because I felt invaluable to her like I'm just a test on if she likes dating me and not an actual transparent relationship. What i mean by transparent relationship or what I thought one was, is that you're honest with each other and go to one another to vent or talk about something that's bothering you but she has this online family with ""big and little brothers"" who she does that with instead of me. I also doubt her brothers know about me which bothers me more, for example, one day she was ignoring all my text and being extremely short we had plans but they were canceled because of it and i find out later that she took the WHOLE day trying to cheer her brother up because he didn't feel like woman loved him.

There's so many things that bother me here, how vague she was, the fact she said she really wants to go to him to make him feel better. His issue is he can't get a girl or get laid and she wants to go help him by meeting idk what she plans on doing for him but it sounds like it could lead to things. Especially sense when a girl did come into her online brothers life and he gave her a lot of attention it annoyed my gf so much so that we had to again cancel plans of spending time together and she ghosted me again, i do admit to having issues with jealousy but my girl being so focused on some guy she has known longer than me and talks to about everything but doesn't tell me really anything is very unsettling. I'm pretty sure he is probably her crush or is it just me? 

And to top it off we had a discussion about our love for each other because i started to question it and her reason for dating is basically that she didn't want to hurt my feelings because she knew how much i was falling for her, i kept asking if she really loves me then and she was really dodgy about the question and in a flimsy way said yes, i asked her why and she didn't have any reason why.

So now she hasn't been texting me, our conversations are very forced or kinda stale, she doesn't hang out with me or do anything sexual anymore. Our relationship is less than a friendship and it's been this way all month and maybe a few weeks more than that. I've asked why we don't hangout and she said she's tired of trying but I didn't know what that really means and tbh i was afraid of pursuing it completely.


Tl;dr: gf ghosts me and is short when i try to engage a conversation and doesn't try to hangout. gf doesn't feel comfortable seeking me for emotional support and her feelings for me are lower than her feelings for her best friend maybe? I don't know what to do and could use some outer perspective.

"My parents (43F and 58M) are extremely upset because my brother (18M) and I (22M) don’t give enough attention to them.


Hello all, I am writing this because I have no where else to vent to. Before I begin, I would like to state that my mom and dad are amazing parents and do everything to our benefit the best they know how. 

I grew up in a extremely religious household (Slavic Baptist) and recently me and my brother have become agnostic. This has caused a lot of tension between us and our parents because the only thing that matters to them is if we believe in Jesus. It is their definition of success. 

The problem is, even if I wanted to believe I cannot. A lot of the time when I’m down stairs eating or just hanging out my mom would talk about God or asking me when I will come back to him and to church and I just tell her I’m taking a different path. For her, it’s a path to hell but I don’t believe in hell. This makes me not want to spend anymore time than I have to and it hurts them because they think I don’t love them. I love them very much but it hurts to see them hurt because they think we are going to hell. 

I have a busy life, I go to college full time and I also manage a small car dealership and have a large social circle and also workout and have other hobbies. I’m usually tired and just don’t want to deal with their guilt trips at the end of the day. 

I still manage to interact with both of them on most days every morning for breakfast and sometimes dinner. We were never the family to tell each other “I love you” or hug. It was never taught to us and now I feel like they want to blame us for never doing those things. When they say it, I know they mean it but it feels really weird. 

About once a month, I hear them talking bad about us. For example, tonight, my dad was telling my mom about how once we move away we won’t even visit and when they die, we won’t even know where they were buried. This hurts me deeply and they are a big reason why I’ve become depressed over the years. 

Me being 22, I don’t feel like I should be getting texts and calls after 11 pm on a weekend asking me where I am and when I’m coming home. My mom is upset that I want to move away so young and is taking it personally. Honestly they are a big reason why I want to move away because of this. Everytime I walk through the front door I am hoping they are asleep so I don’t have to deal with anything. 

Please tell me in the comment section on what you would do in my situation or if you had a situation similar to mine. Thanks for reading.

"I love my SO's kids but only in small portions.


Hey Reddit, 

I've been really into a guy I've been dating for about the last 3 years. About the 2 year mark, he introduced me to his kids. The reason we met his kids at the 2 year mark was because we both wanted to be sure we were a solid thing before having the kids involved. 

My boyfriend is older with 2 kids, a 9 year old boy and a 5 year old girl. I love them both so much. I am much younger than my SO and have previously thought that due to me not wanting to produce any children of my own, dating a guy with his own kids would be more ideal due to not having a pressure from a guy to have them. 

For the last year or so, I've hung out with the kids, and it appears on consecutive day 4/5, I can't handle them. I'm overly an introvert so I relax but being by myself. I'm in love with my boyfriend and love his kids but my worry of not being able to handle his children for more than a few days has me thinking that I should end it. 

Please, help.

I know it sounds ridiculous.. as I’ve gotten older, I feel like I hear nothing about men other than their constant infidelity, how they fear commitment, hate their wives, or cheat on their girlfriends as soon as the opportunity presents itself.. I know obviously all men are not like this, but I lose hope that there are any left who truly love, appreciate and remain faithful to their woman.  I wish that they were more common and more celebrated. I’m sick of everyone making cheating into a joke.

"My [25F] Dad [50] is a know it all. How do you maintain conversations?



TLDR: My dad is a know it all, and cannot accept criticism from anybody. How do I have or maintain conversations with him?

Hi, I am a 25F with a 50 yo Dad. 

I have found recently that my dad cannot stand it when anyone corrects him. It seems that as he has become more successful in his career, he is less humble and willing to take criticism. Just talking about our relationship specifically, it has created a lot of strife between us and a lot of times we just don’t talk. 

I have emailed him (he travels weeks at a time, otherwise I would say it in person) to talk about how our relationship has been difficult and apologize for being stubborn at times. I also mentioned that I hope that we could have more respect for everyone as I felt we were at each other’s throats at times. But he only replied, “You need earn respect to receive it. Do not lecture me ever again”.

How do you handle someone who is a know-it-all? Perhaps as I am getting older I also am becoming a know-it-all, but the type of responses my dad gives (in later examples) just doesn’t seem mature?

Typical conversations go like this... 

Convo 1:
Dad: Our brains are wired. You have it set when you’re young and you can never change.
Me: But we can rewire brains, we just —

"work-life balance


I am in college majoring in engineering and lately I feel that all I do is study. This has paid off greatly for me academically through a 4.0, publications, etc. The thing is I have only one friend, and haven't had anything romantic going on for years. I'm fine with this and focusing on my studies, I'm just wondering if this is normal. I feel like everyone is concerned with relationships and puts so much time into them but me. Possibly there is a correlation that I don't masturbate (or have sex). I've been trying this out for a while and I feel I have complete control over my sexual energy and funnel all of myself into academics. Sometimes I with I could get girls, but I know the reason I don't is because I don't put in the time or effort to socialize. Perhaps I am just overthinking myself and should be happy with my work ethic, I'd be happy to hear some thoughts."
"I (31F) have come to the realization that our relationship is over. What next?


Hi there. I (31F) have realized that my nearly 7 year relationship with him (30M) is over. Before this relationship, I never lived on my own. From 17-27 I lived with and took care of a relative who paid all bills aside from my cell phone &amp; gas. I had barely built up any credit.

Since moving into our own apartment 5 years ago, we've been splitting most bills including rent, utilities and groceries. Almost everything is in my name. 

My question is along the lines of how do I legally disconnect myself from this person? My leasing office won't open until Monday, and I do intend on meeting with someone to discuss how I can remove myself from the lease (which is through July 2019) Anything I  specific I should ask or watch out for? 

He also made monthly payments to me for a vehicle I had once I purchased my newer one. We never did anything in terms of the title or registration, so I am also seeking advice on smoothly transitioning with that.

Within this time we have also acquired a lot of collectables and gaming systems. Two TVs and other appliances. I purchased nearly everything, but we also split the costs on most items. There are certain things I am okay to let go of, but others that I think will cause a fight. 


I feel like a sheltered moron. I barely had to pay any bills throughout my twenties and hate that I am so clueless on what to do next. I just want to ensure this can come to it's close as seamlessly as possible.

I’ve never felt like this before.

Some background info:
The breaking up was abrupt, so that she hated me and I would not make her feel bad about herself, as she had some extreme thoughts about herself (she used to self harm, i am not sure about if she still does) She also said that she would be there for me if I need her (I am now sure if that would help me) Thanks in advance."

Soon I felt useless when she continued and couldn’t hold on to her burden any longer by myself. In the end I was selfish and stopped trying to save her.

When her family and friends asked her “why I ended things?” she was forced to opened up to them about her burdens, she created a support group of her family and friends without me and she became so strong and happy (hasn’t harmed herself since the break up). And I want to be a part of that support group again, but I feel this extreme guilt whenever I try.

When she told her mother why I ended things with her, her mother told her that “he did not love you enough to love you through your pains.” 

It has been 6 months since our break up and I still can not stop thinking about how I want to be a part of her life again, but I know that I can’t bring myself to ask for her back when in the end I can’t look at her mother and friends without that guilt; the guilt of me giving up on her before.

I know that she still loves me, as she has told me during this last two months (we talk on and off) but every time I want to tell her how I feel/want to try again, I feel that extreme guilt. 

I don’t know what advice I need."

"I [18F] need advice on how to surprise my [22M] boyfriend


So my boyfriend \[22m\] and I \[18f\] have been together for a few months, and things are going really well.  He talks about how he feels stressed at work, and I want to help him relax, I have a place to myself for a week and he plans to come around some time.  For at least one night, I want to give my boyfriend a really relaxing night to de-stress.  The current ideas me and my best friend managed to come up with was either a nice relaxing bath complete with a bath bomb, or a full body massage.  I don't really know how to romance in the good and proper way, and was hoping to get some advice?

**Tl;dr - My boyfriend has been stressed at work and I want to surprise him, but I'm romantically inept and need ideas.**"
"How do we [19-20s][Ms/Fs] tell our friend [19F] that we don't want to share a flat with her next academic year?


So at university I am part of a small friendship group of about 7 people, out of that 7, 4 of us are currently living together in our second year (two girls and two guys). The other 3 either  live with other people or still live at home. The 4 of us get on really well, and in general never have any issues.

One of the aforementioned 3 friends (we'll call her C) who doesn't currently live with us wants to live with us next year, originally we all agreed that this would be fine, but after coming back after the summer break we've realised that we don't want to live with her next year even though C is still sure that she is living with us.

Initially, she kept on jabbing at me while together in class and in general being bitchy, calling me out on random things and in general making me feel like I'm walking on eggshells. This in turn caused an argument at which point I decided that I wasn't living in a house where I'm made to feel like that. At that point forward I kept my distance from C and things cooled down, I realised that the less time I spend with her the less issues there are, so you can see why I don't want to live with her. 

Once things cooled off between me and C, she started targeting another one of my flat mates (We'll call him K) with the same type of behaviour leading him also to agree that he doesn't want to live with her next year. The two girls we live with don't mind C because she has never done anything personally to them, but they agree that if me and K are uncomfortable living with her then they'll back us up.

The one issue is, we don't know how to tell C that she isn't living with us. Every so often she'll bring it up and talk about the type of things she'll be getting up to when she's living with us next year, but unfortunately she isn't.

Sometimes I do feel bad about leaving her out, but I'm not living in a house where I feel uncomfortable and living on egg shells, and K feels the same. The girls agree that they don't want to live in a house where there is agro. Furthermore, C lives locally, so her finding a flat next year is not a necessity. She's definitely not the type of person to listen to us if we told her how we felt, so for example ""we feel that there is going to be arguments and problems next year if you live with us, so I'd you agree to change you can live with us."" She's very stubborn and won't willingly change her behaviour. She's very un-empathetic.

So how do we break it to her? We want to maintain the friendship group, but we have no idea how to bring up the subject without it being awkward and difficult (I guess that's unavoidable though). The housing prices for next year are going up soon, so we are looking to sort this issue out soon and move on.

TL;DR: Friend is convinced she is living with us next year, but half of our current flat don't get on with her. How do we tell her she's not living with us?"
"Roommates [F21] [F22] misrepresented their financial situation going into new lease and now I [F23] am paying more but don't know if I have a right to be mad at this point


I met my roommates online, and we became close friends long before we moved in. This year we moved in together, one of them migrating from a foreign country. They are also a couple. The one who migrated has been here for six months and hasn't found any work (she doesn't have much experience and suffers from social anxiety) so she's been leaning on her partner for rent. 

&amp;#x200B;

This hasn't impacted me in any way yet, except I occasionally pay for their food since they're always very vocal about how much they can't afford and are flat broke. We're become even closer since we moved in, and they're good friends with my girlfriend. That's why the next parts feel complicated for me.

&amp;#x200B;

We're applying for a new place and moving in soon. The plan has been for me and the roommate who works to cover the rent, so the one who doesn't work would be contributing nothing to rent. I've been able to rationalise this because it's only for a couple months until my girlfriend moves in and she helps contribute, the girl who isn't paying is constantly looking for work, and again we're all really good friends.

&amp;#x200B;

However, recently (through legitimate means, not snooping) I found out that they have thousands in a savings account. I feel very confused since they've always portrayed themselves as being flat broke  and living paycheck to paycheck, and I feel less comfortable about paying more rent and confused about why they acted as if they can't afford food. The money (I assume) is for the visa, which is why they don't want to touch it, though. 

&amp;#x200B;

I simultaneously feel frustrated but also like I don't have a right to comment on their financial choices, and also like I've made a mistake offering to pay more rent, but also unsure how to word it in a way that won't damage our friendship or seem like I'm backflipping. I understand that I should have been more communicative and I've learnt a couple of hard lessons, but am unsure of how to proceed from this point.

&amp;#x200B;

Any thoughts would be appreciated.

&amp;#x200B;

TL:DR Offered to pay more rent believing that my close friends were broke, but now have discovered they have money saved up and don't know how to proceed."

"Is she just flirting or does she like me/ want me to ask her out?


TL;DR- Thought girl was into me, asked her out. Said yes then no because she was kind of dating someone, isn't anymore. She had a change of attitude, started flirting more, now I think she might want me to ask her out again. 

&amp;#x200B;

She's 21f and I'm 23m. 

A brief summary of how things have gone with her... Met this girl and we saw each other often at school. I got out of a relationship a few months before we started talking to each other and were becoming friends. She asked for my number and we started texting somewhat often. Whenever I would see her we would always lock eyes and maintain eye contact (somewhat intense and not super welcoming), we have a similar sense of humor so we were always sarcastic with each other but lots of laughs and smiles. She would bring up other guys a lot but talk about them as 'he's cute' or 'this hot guy...'. Our conversations are pretty endless and it usually takes one of us to 'ok I actually need to get going' to stop them. Took this as a sign she liked me so I asked her out. She said yes but then after not being able to find a good day for both she said she wasn't certain she was looking for a relationship because I may not be over my ex and she was still figuring things out, but still wanted to talk to and hang out with me (didn't say friends). This happened about a month and a half ago or so.

I found out only a few days ago from a mutual friend of ours told me that at the time I first asked her out she was dating someone more seriously than I thought (she had told me it was very casual/non-committal hookup buddy). 

&amp;#x200B;

So I stopped texting her and hanging out with her, giving her space essentially. After like two weeks or so we started hanging out again and texting. Only this time she would reach out to me, for logistical stuff but she had NEVER done this before and she was texting every other day or so. Her texts are longer and have more emojis. She is getting as close to me physically as possible when I see her. We still maintain long eye contact but this now there's something different about it, sort of like the 'do me' eyes and her eyes seem brighter. Tells me more personal stuff now, and she's slow to open up to people. She won't move if I get super close to her and let's me touch her and she won't move, she's held out her hands a lot to show me that they're cold or shaking and let's me grab them. She also just seems to be in a better mood around me too. She still brings up guys a lot but now only mentions them as friends. And the other week she brought up the fact that when I met briefly visited her house her sister had thought that I was really cute and then told me about how she had chewed her out saying that I was too old for her or something.

&amp;#x200B;

Anyway this sort of shift in the signs she's giving me makes me think she wants me to ask her out again, I know I should just man up and do it and if she says no again oh well. I just wanted some second opinions in case this is just her being flirty and not actually wanting me to ask her out... What do y'all think?
