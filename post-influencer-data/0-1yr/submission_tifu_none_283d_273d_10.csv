"TIFU by not wanting to walk two blocks


Context: Okay, so today its ""election's day"" here in Peru. The thing starts at 8am until 4pm. There are three board members and each one have two back ups. 

I went to vote with my dad at 8:30am. The place was empty. No board members and no voters. So we wait until 9:15am (hungry without breakfast) and he says: ""okay, I'm going to buy something for breakfast, then I come back"". So he leaves and he send me a whatsapp at 9:45am, I told him I'm still waiting and there are not any board members at all. He tells me to go home and then we'll come back later, I said nahh I'll wait because I'm a lazy fuck and didn't want to go home then return. FIRST FUCKED UP.

So its almost 10am, its hot, i'm hungry and I see a line at my table. So I think ""FINALLY"" WRONG. A board member was there and told me to give her my ID. She tells me if I can stay to help the line going, I said I can't, I have important things to do, thats why I went early (important things like a BBQ). So she tells me its my civic duty and otherwise I'll have to pay a fine. By that time there is the board member girl, three people that organizes this shit, and a militar. So basically I'm fucked up.

I didn't know what to do, so me being a 22 year old girl that still relies on their parents, I called my dad and start screaming that they asked me to be a board member, otherwise I'll have to pay the fine. He (being a hot temper man) says I should tell them to fuck themselves and just leave. I'm like ""dad, there are militars here"" He says ""I'm gonna talk to your mom and I'll call you"".

Longest five minutes of my life, the militars looking at me, the board bitch looking at me, all fucking eyes on me. Should I run? What if they shoot me on the legs? So my dad calls me, basically tells me the same stuff he told me already. I told him I'll call him back because a girl and an old lady are coming.

The girl that organizes this stuff, a 65ish lady and a militar came and tell me to go to the table. I don't them no, I'm not gonna do it. ""They you'll have to pay the fee"" The old lady goes ""Look, I have a three year old daughter, my husband just died, but I'm gonna stay with you to get the line going"" ""Sorry old lady, but I have stuff to do"" ""Its your civic duties"" ""I just can't"" Old lady ""Just go with me"" 

At that moment I didn't care. I was being pushed so I turned around, scream ""IM GOING TO PAY THE FEE THEN"" and literally RUN AWAY. The girl was screaming ""YOUR ID"" FUCK IT. I runned like Forest, didn't look back once. I get home and feel free.

Now I have to pay like $100 dollars and get a new ID because mine its still there. 

TL;DR: Didn't want to get back home (two blocks away), run away from my civic duties, now I have to pay 100 dollars and get a new ID."
"TIFU by forgetting about my textbooks and costing myself $800


Like many college students, I rent my textbooks instead of buying overpriced books that I'll likely never use outside of class (or even in class sometimes). While, I haven't had problems with this in the past, this quarter I made a mistake.

 I don't know whether it was me being distracted by finals, or if I just forgot how renting works over summer break, but I completely forgot to return them. During any other quarter this would be fine, as I could just turn them in late for a smaller fee, but because its winter quarter, the dorm halls are closed. Furthermore, I have already traveled home for the holidays.

I could turn them in within the next 2 days, but the cost of flights plus the fee for being let inside the closed dorm hall would cost more than the late fees.

The reason the cost is so high is because my textbooks happened to be especially expensive this quarter, because multiple classes required textbooks that were bundled with online courses.

I know that there is no excuse for my stupidity, but if anyone had any advice on how I could attempt to at least mitigate these fees, it would be appreciated. Sorry if this violates Rule 2, but I needed to vent, even if it gets taken down.

TL;DR: Tried to save money by renting.Cost myself 800 dollars instead

Edit: Should have mentioned that I don't have access to the books, because I left them in my dorm room, if it wasn't clear"

"TIFU By being emotionally unstable and living alone for the week.


Sadly this did happen today and not my proudest moment, but here’s a little backstory. So I’m 19(barely) and still living with my family on an arrangement that I do work around the house and help with meals in exchange for a place to stay. Works out well, I got my own room and it’s close to my room. Well for the week my sizable family is heading down to Florida and I’m up here watching the house for them. What they don’t know is recently I’ve been having some problems with my social life. I can’t hold onto friends well and have almost no one to talk to anymore. I do have one newer friend who I’ve been talking to a lot who I very much enjoy talking too, along side maybe two others but that’s not important. Also to note I was a fat kid growing up, but put in maybe 20+ hours a week at the gym for the last year and a half so I’m just generally very large. 

Flash to today and I had morning plans to hang with this person, have barely spent any time with them recently despite them saying over and over they’d like too. We go to hang out and run into a friend of theirs and they ditch me saying their sorry and wants to catch up some other time. So I head home, obviously a bit pissed. But for some reason the more I try to do something else the more pissed I get, so I decide to go to the gym. Snag some protein when I see a post from the friends insta about them with their friend. And in my very angry and caffeine charged state I decided to bang the table by me. I didn’t plan on hitting it very hard, but I fucking take both fists and smash the end down. Very smoothly breaking it. Best part is that one of my family members is coming back in town for work reasons tonight and I’m going to need to find some logical excuse why the table is wonky and held together with makeshift splints instead of its standard function, and probably going to need to buy a new one.


Tldr: Friend ditches me, get mad, smashes table, hits way harder then planned, table broke."
"TIFU By drooling on a secretary


This wasn’t today, but 8 years ago. It was my first day at my new job. I was filling out some paperwork while, this very attractive secretary, was entering in my information. I noticed they had a bowl of starbursts on the counter, so I grabbed one, unwrapped it and put it in my mouth. The secretary asked me to come around and verify some information on her monitor. I leaned over her as I started to chew and started to salivate. I started drooling right over her neck.  I tried to suck it in, but it was too late. A thick slimy drip went right down her neck, into her shirt. She stood up and started to freak out in disgust. (Which was totally justified) I spent the next 5-10 minutes apologizing and explaining what happened. It was hand down the most awkward/cringe situation I’ve ever been in. It’s been 8 years and I still think about it daily. 

TLDR: ate a starburst while stand long over an attractive secretary and drooled down her neck."

"TIFU by not waiting 30 seconds to take a toilet break


TL;DR at bottom. On mobile so forgive formatting 

Ok so this actually happened today! Approximately 3 minutes ago and so I am still in the first stage of the mortification process - denial.

I’ve recently started working the night shift at my job. It’s pretty laid back - I just wait for a call to come through so most of it is just sitting around twiddling my thumbs. There are currently 2 other people in the office - my manager sat opposite me, and a cardigan-wearing dude (CWD) in the back (idk what he does). 

I’ve been sitting here for a while, my dinner has been digested - thus, a bubble formed in my stomach to warn me of an incoming visitor. Easily dealt with, just adjust said seating position to allow a silent trump out. Then the cups of tea I’ve been guzzling all night arrived at their final destination and so it was time to make The Trip. 
Just as I make this decision, said CWD comes in through the front of the office, presumably on his was back from a cigarette break. The thought crosses my mind to stay at my desk until he has safely passed, but things were really moving around and so, throwing caution to the wind, I decide fuck it and begin my journey around my desk to the bogs. 

Big. Mistake.

What I had failed to realise, due to the fact that I am a very young female who should not have (and has never before had) this problem, is that another part of my anatomy had taken on some wind of its own. Any woman will tell you that when the air gets down there, there’s nothing you can do. You must reside yourself to the proud parp which will undoubtedly fill the air around you with its symphony. 

Up I get and, lo and behold, just as i crossed paths with CWD next to the desk of my manager, the loudest, longest and most flappy queef you could ever have imagined resonated from my body, eeking itself out in increments as i walked, with each toot turning my face a deeper shade of crimson. No one said anything, but i saw the smirk on the face of cardigan dude.   I can only take solace in the thought that he probably assumed it was a fart, and not the product of a severely misbehaving vajay-jay. And now I have to work the rest of my shift without jumping out of the window.

TL;DR- needed the loo. Decided not to wait for colleague to return to desk and subsequently conflicted him and my manager to an uncontrollable and unexpected queef.

"Is my landlord blackmailing me?


TIFU - standard, didn’t happen today but I’m looking for advice as it’s an ongoing issue. 

Back in 2013 I entered into a tenancy agreement.  The agreement said I would pay water and electricity utilities.   It also said that my landlord would pay management fees and rates.  

At the time we signed the agreement we went to great effort to transfer all the bills to be paid by me into my name, and the landlord asked for evidence of the transfer which I provided.   

We moved out 2.6 years ago.  Got an email this week from the landlord saying that he wanted £800 for water.  The water for the block of flats is charged to the management fee as a whole and is the split out between all the flats.   In the tenancy agreement I said I would pay for the water - but this is the first time he’s mentioned it.  Due to the way it’s charged I expected that it would be covered under the management fee and accounted for within the rental cost.    Most landlords charge a rent that covers all their expenses.   He can’t bill me directly for those things but would do so indirectly through the rent.  

Anyway, he’s demanded payment within 21 days (payment due on Christmas Day!) if I don’t pay he will take me to court.     So I took some free advice and they said that my understanding about it being indirectly charged was reasonable, particularly as we didn’t make any specific arrangements, and that the timeframe for this request from him is unreasonable.   However legally he is owed the money and can demand it up to 10 years after the debt became due.  

To further complicate the issue, there’s now the matter of rates charges.    After I received the request for water charges I reviewed the tenancy and correspondence from him and realised that he was meant to pay rates.   And this is where I totally fucked up.  I receive a demand in 2014 for payment of rates,  he told me the law had changed on 01 April 2014 and I was now legally liable for the payment of rates.    At the time I just stupidly paid it and now he thinks he can come back demanding more money from me.   So As I was asking about my rights on the issue I asked citizens advice about the rates and they said actually the law changed in 2005, the details in his demand letter are inaccurate and actually under the terms of the tenancy he was liable for the charge not me! It was about £5/600 quid. 

So what do I do?   Ignore his latest request or respond with a demand for reimbursement of the rates under the same terms that he is asking for payment of the water?   I’ve spent the week having imaginary war of words with him in front of judge rinder / judge Judy where I’m basically smashing it with my best Harvey Spectre act.   (But let’s be honest if it goes to court I’m screwed,  the landlords a lawyer and I get called Jackie Russel by husband cause I’m a small yappy argumentative bitch).  

TLDR: stupidly paid money to my landlord that he wasn’t owed, now he thinks I’m a cash cow and he’s looking for more.  "
"TIFU by talking to a Swede about musk.


This happened back around 2006 or 2007.  And i just recalled this gem from some random word i heard during the news. 

On to the story.
So years ago, i worked for the nuke industry, traveling around to various parts of the USA, inspecting nuke plants (specifically reactor vessel heads). The team i worked with was comprised of Germans, Swedes, and americans.

We all worked long hours and many days in a row. Being on the road for months at a time, really takes its toll on you. Usually when days off are scheduled, it is staggered due to coverage. Well, the jobaite was shut down for a day so the craft could install some scaffolding or something. We all got the night off together.

Imagine a few Germans, and 1 Swedish guy, and several Americans all getting drunk together on the hotel basketball court. Stories are flying, good times had by all. I had origionally thought we were all going out to a club or bar, so i had put on some nice clothes and some cologne.

Turns out, we just got sloppy drunk on the court. Thats all fine and fun. But at this point, i am having to piss every 10 minutes due to the quantity of beer i am consuming. So i decide to piss on this palm tree near the court, it takes less time and i dont have to drunkenly slide my key card into the building which was 30 feet away.

So my Swedish buddy asks me about my ""musk"" and wants to know if i am wearing it. I am confused, due to the language barrier and his thick accent. Then it clicks, ""oh, you mean my cologne?"". He says NO! your musk, dont you wear your musk? So this confusing conversation is going on and im doing the pee pee dance.  He then says that your musk, is the pheromones and you wear it when you go out, this helps get the ladies. I said that i dont have any pheromones to apply, and i just use a spray bottle of cologne. I asked him where he gets his pheromones.

This guy says, ""you take your finger and you wipe it around your cock, between the foreskin and head, this is where you get your pheromones, then you wipe it on your neck"" it helps get the ladies. He then is talking about how it smells like mushrooms. Gag.

Well, at this point of the conversation, i am pissing on my palm tree friend, and finishing up this odd, drunken conversation, and i reply with ""well, i am circumsized, so i dont have that option. Dude takes my dick out of my hand while i am pissing, and is examining it.. I jump back and put my member away, and say"" what the fuck (insert Swedish name here), you dont just grab a dudes dick.
He sais he had never seen a circumsized penis before other than in porn. 

Needless to say everyone around was in an awkward state, and i was in shock. We change the topic of conversation, pretty quickly and opened another beer.

TLDR. A swede grabbed my cock to inspect for circumcision, while i was pissing. "
"TIFU By talking about NNN to a fellow member, causing another member to leave.


(on phone)

So, me and this other guy, let’s call him Bacon, posts a portion of a manga page off of One Punch Man. Me, thinking it was something else accuse him of posting doujinshi, which was forbidden in our Discord Server. He ends up going online and looks for the source image, (which he finds, great) and accuses me of failing NNN (No Nut November). I tell him I failed on the 5th, he jokingly says he’ll ban me, as he was the owner. He then posts a picture of an anime girl with the expression of recently orgasming. Then he spams it for a while, then the person who will leave because of our actions comes in and says “うるさい” meaning “Noisy” in Japanese, we ignore them and continue arguing, which caused them to leave. They we’re one of the oldest members who we’re always online, always praising us for our efforts. One of the other owners come in and yells at us. So we then accidentally delete around 2 days of chat in the channel to remove the evidence of our dispute by not typing the command for !clear correctly. In the end, I was given ownership of the server while Bacon now leaves for a flight somewhere in Australia... Now, I’m stuck with a server with a pissed and depressed owner. I consider the server as family, so it’s really hard trying to get over this while I have other issues irl.

TL;DR: Accused Owner of posting doujinshi, he spams, end up ignoring a fellow member who ends up leaving the server."
"TIFU by getting over excited about office Christmas events


I love Christmas and holiday celebrations, so I was really excited when my work decided we would be doing a Secret Santa. 

Once everyone had drawn their names, I went around asking who got whom. I know it's a nosy habit, but it's been a lot of fun in past years with it basically turning into an office intrigue game. 

A lot of people outright refused to tell me, which is fine and still fun. A few gave me a name, but I also don't know if they're being truthful or not, and I wasn't always truthful with what I said either. And of course it was all whispered.

Until I asked one person, who said very loudly who it was. The whole office heard, including their secret person, and people got mad at me for asking in the first place.

Now I feel like shit and this all feels like it blew up in my face. The only person who said not to worry about it is my neighbor who spoke too loudly. I haven't spoken to anyone else since, as I am very socially awkward and still feel very upset that I screwed up so badly. 

TL;DR I asked everyone who they drew for Secret Santa, one person answered loudly enough for the whole office to hear and now I'm being blamed for ruining the event."
