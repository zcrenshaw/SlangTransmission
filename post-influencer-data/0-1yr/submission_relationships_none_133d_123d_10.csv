"I'm ready to leave my (31F) husband (30M) over an oil change


I (31F) am so overwhelmed and literally about to leave my husband (30M) of 6 years because we cannot get on the same page about managing our household.

Naively, I thought we were perfect before we had our daughter (2F), but I clearly see now that I was wrong, and the imbalance in our relationship was simply exposed by having our child.

My husband has a very demanding job as a teacher and high school sport coach. As an educator, he is 100% committed to his students and players, and for that reason, he has been promoted countless times as a coach and even won Teacher of the Year two years ago.

As a partner, I love and respect him dearly. The problem is that he is not an active member of our household. I work full-time, handle all daycare drop off and pick up, consult part-time to supplement our income, manage the household budget, plan family trips, coordinate social schedules, plan child activities, buy all gifts and cards, handle grocery shopping, cooking, everything. 

I have talked to him countless times about taking some of the load off my plate. I assign him tasks, make lists and even put things on his calendar. And yet, he still forgets to pay his credit card bill (example: forgot to pay a $29 balance for three months which dropped his credit score by 70 points just as we were buying a house), get basic car maintenance done (example: noticed yesterday he needed to get an oil change for his car by NOVEMBER 2018) and even forgets easy stuff like ordering pizza for our daughter's 2nd birthday party WHEN THAT WAS THE ONLY THING HE HAD TO DO! 

I'm honestly so exhausted. We tried couples therapy and she kept insisting to me that I should let the system fail when he's supposed to be responsible for tasks. But who is going to fix the chaos that ensues?? When we talk about it, he simply shuts down. It's like he's paralyzed by responsibility at home. For example, we hosted a get together at home for his players, and he ordered the food, cleaned before, coordinated times, organized games, everything. But for anything outside of work, he simply will not do!

I'm currently in individual therapy because I recognize now that I played a role in creating this problem by constantly fixing everything. But we agreed for us to BOTH go to individual counseling. I just finished my fourth session and he hasn't even found a therapist or had one single consultation. 

It may be helpful to know that his mother did everything for their family when they were growing up. She's the ultimate problem solver and can do a ton in very little time. While I had a different situation where my dad was a very active member of our household. He took us to all of our appointments, did all the cleaning and grocery shopping, planning of family trips, etc. 

Does anyone have any tips on how to equally distribute labor at home with children? 

TL;DR Ready to leave because my husband, who is a superstar at work, is paralyzed by responsibilities at home and it's getting worse and worse"
"My [32M] wife [31F] of 3 years and I have been sleeping in separate rooms for 3 months because she's an extra light sleeper. I really miss the full nights together. Is there any way to compensate?


For years she had bad night's sleep because I would wake her up becuase she sleeps ultra light. Like, I slowly, quietly get up to go the bathroom, any minor vibration in the bed would make her jump awake and go ""huh?!"", really startled.

In practice, I think it's been for the best. There was a night dynamic of me trying and failing to be super stealthy when moving in bed and her waking up at the slightest movement anyway, so it's best for her to sleep in peace and on her own temperture, etc., settings.

*But*, I miss the full nights together, especially after intimacy. On the nights with no sex, we have dinner and do our own thing or something together until it's time for bed. When we do have sex, we chill for about 20 minutes after, and then she says ""babe, I'm starting to feel sleepy"", and that's my cue for going to my room.

Those 20 minutes feel like the best thing ever and I frequently find myself disappointed that I have to leave to my room.

I understand this is the best for her and there's been very positive results for the quality of her sleep, but damn if it doesn't feel lonely sometimes. Is there anthing I/we can to compensate for not spending the night together? I know it seems silly, since we are not doing much bonding while asleep anyway, but the lack of physical closeness at night has been hard for me. Should I just get over it?

**tl;dr:** Wife and I are sleeping in different rooms becuase she sleeps very light. I miss the physical closeness. Is there anything we can do to compensate?"
"How do I (26f) kindly tell my FIL and MIL to stop pressuring me to work?


My husband (32M), myself and our son (9mo) recently moved back to our home state, to a small rural town close to his parents. We are doing good. My husband got a job with great hours and pay. We are renting a decent house for cheap. His parents have been incredibly helpful, with buying us a washer and dryer, bringing us groceries. We didn't ask for it, but we appreciate it nonetheless. 

But they will not stop sending me job recommendations. Daily. At first, I took it as them being helpful. Now? They are getting pushy, and judgy. I ignore their messages now, but they still keep sending me links to places that are hiring, and forwarding other opportunities to me. 

We are financially stable and happy. Our current situation works like this: husband wakes up at 4am,goes to work. I get up with the baby around 5 or 6, take care of him and do literally everything else except bring in an income. I clean, I cook, I handle the budget, home repairs, phone calls, paperwork, appointments. I do everything house and family related. Everything. And I get up with our son every 2 hours, every night, because he still doesn't sleep through. My husband comes home around 4 and plays with the baby while I do laundry and cook or do anything that didn't get done earlier. 

We are both happy with our lifestyle. For now. He sat me down recently and told me himself that he'd rather I wait to start working, because we don't need the extra income right now and if I work, it'll add an extra load of stress to both of us. If we work opposite shifts, we will never see each other and neither of us will ever sleep or rest. Same shift, we will need to figure out babysitting and transportation. At the very least he wants me to wait til the baby is sleeping more. I'd love to start working again and if I needed a job, I'd have one instantly with my resume and experience. But this is what is working for us, for right now. 

As I said, at first I just thought his parents were trying to help. Until recently. My son had an appointment several days ago, and I let MIL know I took the bus to bring him. She got agitated with me and claimed that I should have taken my husband to work so that I'd have the vehicle, because she had to do the same thing when her youngest was a baby and they only had one car. She felt I was lazy by taking the bus. I explained to her that I wasn't going to drag the baby out of bed at 4am,drive my husband 30 minutes to work, drive back, drive 30 minutes to sons appt, drive back, and then go pick up my husband. The bus is only a dollar. After that interaction and a couple more, I've gradually come to realize that they are being judgmental of me and seem to think I sit on my ass all day while my husband works to provide for us. It's a shitty feeling that they see it that way. With every job opportunity they send my way, I feel more and more bitter and have no clue how to tell them nicely to shove off. Even my husband is starting to get pissed at their persistence.

The bills are paid, the fridge is full, we are all happy. We can even afford to have a bit of extra fun every other weekend. This isn't going to be the arrangement forever, and I will go back to work and school after some time. But I get to spend every day with my son, my husband gets to come home to a clean house and relax. We are lucky to be in this position but his parents want us to do things differently and struggle the same as they did.

I don't want to be mean to them. I just want them to stay out of our business and stop sending me job recommendations and tagging me in ""now hiring"" posts on FB. Every. Single. Day. They are good people otherwise and I love how involved they are in our sons life. The last thing I want is to add tension between us.

Tl;dr: my FIL and MIL won't stop pressuring me to get a job, despite my husband and I being financially stable and happy with our current situation."
"My f(27) and my fiance's m(27) friends have tried to convince him to leave me due to my disability


Hi everyone,

I'm finding all this very overwhelming so I will keep it short.

They have been our shared friendship group since we got together 8 years ago. I've had a disability for about three years. 

I recently found out three members have tried to convince my fiance to leave me on multiple occasions, purely due to my disability. They basically said they don't see the point of staying with a disabled person and they want him to be happy. He assured them each time he is happy and it is his choice to stay with me. 

They are all acting as though it is normal that they would try to convince him to leave, and that I'm overreacting by being upset. They've also stated they wanted ""what was best for both of us"" which I think was pretty obviously not true.

I'm just trying to get some clarity here because I'm feeling very confused and worthless. I have myself given my fiance the option of leaving many times and said i wouldn't blame him, but he always said he wanted to stay.

Is their behaviour normal? Is it OK for me to be upset?

Thanks in advance

Tl;dr : group members have tried to convince my partner to leave me due to my disability. Is that normal, and is it OK for me to feel upset."
"UPDATE: ""My friend (30s F) is adamant that I (30s F) leave my children (6M,4F) in the hands of childcare workers I barely know. I refused. But it might cost us the friendship.""


Almost 2 months ago I made the post [""My friend (30s F) is adamant that I (30s F) leave my children (6M,4F) in the hands of childcare workers I barely know. I refused. But it might cost us the friendship.""](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/azbcmw/my_friend_30s_f_is_adamant_that_i_30s_f_leave_my/)

Not only did I end up not leaving my children in their care. Thank you to everybody who threw up those red flags. I left the church entirely and stopped going. One month ago, after the reveal of some family secrets, I vowed never to set foot in a church again. Two weeks ago, I left Christianity.

May not be the update I wanted to share but it is my reality now.

On the plus side I've been able to reconnect more closely with some family who had left the church earlier. I never shunned them and they never shunned me but I put a distance between us that has melted away now. Surprisingly they all embraced me back into their lives.

My atheist brother is marrying his atheist fiancee this summer and I am so happy for them. I feel a joy for them I couldn't have imagined feeling while I put unnecessary walls between us.

I don't think all Christians have these walls but for me I had to take a step back from the faith to reconnect with people. Maybe one day I could join a more open church.

TL;DR: Not only did I end up not leaving my children in their care. I left the church and later left Christianity."
"My (26f) boyfriend (29m) feels that there’s no reason for me to know who his friends are or anything about them.


My boyfriend and I have been together for a year and a half. I have expressed to him multiple times that I cannot have secrets in a relationship, and that it feels like he hides who his friends are, what their names are, everything about them, as well as hides any conversation that he has with them. I know that he has more female friends than male, and that’s all fine and dandy. But I feel like if you’re having conversations or doing things that you have to hide from your significant other, then you shouldn’t be doing those things or having those conversations. He claims it’s because of how his ex-girlfriends have acted about him having female friends that makes him hide it, but I’m not his exes and I don’t care what gender of friends he has so long as he sets clear boundaries, respects our relationship, and demands their respect for our relationship. I’ve asked him many times to just be open about it so that I don’t feel like he’s hiding things from me. I’m not asking to see his texts or supervise his conversations or anything like that, but when I ask just out of curiosity who he’s texting (like he sometimes does to me), I expect openness and honesty about who it is instead of “a friend”. He’s constantly texting people and has all kinds of friends all over the world, yet I only know the names of three of them. Everyone else is “oh, just a friend”. He thinks that it’s so absurd and controlling for me to want to know who his friends are and things about them, which makes me feel like he just doesn’t want me involved in his life in any depth.  He made the comment last night that “it’s not like you’re ever going to meet them, so why does it matter?” 🤨 But he plans trips to go see said friends and I’m never invited, and apparently (based on that comment), I never will be invited. Even when some of his friends come to our area, he mentions going to see them, but I’m never invited. 

I have always been open and honest about my friends. When he asks who I’m texting or what has me smiling when I’m looking at my phone, I tell him. I have nothing to hide, so it’s no big deal. He knows the code to my phone, and I can hand him my phone to respond to my texts while I’m driving. I’ve made every effort to be transparent with him. 

I love him and want to build a life with him, but after being in a marriage where my ex-husband kept secret after secret from me, secrets are just an absolute dealbreaker. It seems like he thinks this is perfectly normal for me to never know anything about his friends and never meet them, but I’ve never been in or known of a relationship where this is a thing. This has been going on from day one, and marriage is something that he’s expressed he wants. 

I guess I’m asking - - Would it be acceptable to you for your significant other to never tell you anything about their friends (no names, no info, nothing), and for you to never meet them? And - How can I explain this to him??

TLDR; Boyfriend of 1.5 year won’t tell me anything about his friends, says that I’ll never meet them so it doesn’t matter whether I know them or not. I’m not invited on trips to see his friends, nor am I invited to meet up with them when they are in our town and he goes to see them. This has been going on from day one."
"My (37F) husband’s (38M, married 5y) potential emotional affair partner is meeting with me to discuss a semi-unrelated conflict. How do I handle this?


My husband and I work in the same very small field, but at different employers. I have a lot of leadership stuff within our local professional community. He works with a woman who, in my opinion, has been incredibly inappropriate with him. Really clingy, late night calls about how she’s lonely, very touchy-feely, has told me that she knows him better than I do (she’d known him for all of 6 months at that point), has tried to get him to go for drinks/meals one-on-one, strokes his ego nonstop, etc. About a year ago, she came to our house for a professional event and made several comments about how people with my credentials were not qualified to do the job that we both do. I am quite a bit senior and more successful, objectively, than she is, FWIW. After that incident, I have avoided her. I’ve never been rude or anything, but I don’t go out of my way to talk to her on the 3-ish times a year that I see her.

She has used this as an excuse to complain about what a meanie I am to many of our colleagues and very frequently to my husband. Like, a lot. Like many many more times (that I know of) than I have actually seen her. So finally, being fed up, I texted her yesterday saying that I had heard that she felt that there was an issue between us, and I would like to clear it up. She thanked me for reaching out, and we are meeting today.

So here is my question: how should I address this? I feel like it is reasonable to discuss the professional comments, but I am not sure if I should bring up the other stuff, or how inappropriate it is that she complains about me to my husband. TBH, if it weren’t for the stupid shit with my husband, I would have forgotten about this a long time ago. Also, I feel like the only reason that she cares this much about me just mildly avoiding her on a semi-yearly basis is to stir up drama and have a wedge with my husband.

Yes, it is totally my husband’s job to shut this down. But after about 4 million conversations about it, he won’t, partly due to a spine deficiency and partly because he wants the attention (my interpretation).  He will not be present.  He is a whole topic for another day.

TL;DR: Husband’s potential EA partner is coming over for a sit-down.  How to proceed?"
"Is there such a thing as intellectually cheating? I [25 F] feel like I'm cheating on my boyfriend [25 M]


To start off, I've [25 F] been with my boyfriend [25 M] for almost 3 years. We've been through thick and thin and I love him. I just don't think I can connect with him at an intellectual level. I can't even have good conversations about things I'm interested in or vice versa. The only overlap for conversations that we have is our profession and our dog. (To add, we did get into a relationship after having worked together a lot, though now we aren't working at the same place.) 

Now I think I'm beginning to realize that we might not have that much in common and I don't know what to do. I really do love him and we have great moments but when those die down, I don't know what else is there. Nothing to pick your brains at, nothing to talk about other than surface level and shallow things. And I try to talk about his interests, but I really can't get into basketball, cars, or shoes.

I have this coworker [25 M] (who has been a good friend of mine for about 2 years) that I can really connect with. We have great conversations and I really enjoy spending time with him but deep inside I feel guilty for enjoying it. I don't really find him attractive (physically) but the thought pops into my mind, that what if I met him sooner? What if we met in different circumstances? I don't really flirt with him or make any advances, though I still talk with him about a lot of things that on the other hand my boyfriend and I, don't connect on.

It feels like I'm emotionally or in this case intellectually cheating but I don't know. It's only been in my head and I haven't really told anyone about it. I don't know if I'm making any sense but it's really been bothering me. Am I just magnifying the want for an intellectual connection since that's something my relationship is lacking? Am I actually cheating? I don't know what to do.

TL;DR: I don't connect with my boyfriend on an intellectual level but I do with a colleague. So it feels like I'm cheating since I enjoy spending time and talking with my colleague."
"My brother [18M] got caught smoking weed; now my parents [51F, 56M] want to drug test me too [23F] to be ""fair"".


My younger brother, let's call him John \[18\], was subjected to random drug testing at his high school last week. (He knew he was eligible for it, students must sign a consent form at the start of the school year). He is a frequent smoker, and tested positive for weed. He tried to get ahead of the situation by telling my parents what had happened. My parents freaked out, acted like John is a complete failure, and started to think of ways to punish him. My parents and my brother already didn't have a great relationship, and this event made it much worse. Thankfully nothing criminal will come of this, John just has to take an online drug counseling course. He is going off to college this fall.

&amp;#x200B;

I \[23F\] am in graduate school in another state. I never smoked in high school, and now in college it's a very infrequent activity, mostly when I'm home by myself to de-stress or at small social gatherings. Weed has never negatively impacted my life, I've gotten good grades, internships, fully-funded grad school, never in trouble with the law. I've always had a great relationship with my parents and feel close to them. 

&amp;#x200B;

Now, my brother and I haven't always had the greatest relationship. My parents tend to view me as the ""golden child"" and compare my brother and I. I've tried to be close with my brother but I think he feels some anger towards me because of my parents. However, one thing John and I recently bonded over was weed. I suspected he smoked and told him I have too. Our relationship improved a bit, I think it helped him see me as more relatable and more of a friend. We talked about it a few times but never smoked together or anything like that.

&amp;#x200B;

Now, back to my parents finding out about John and freaking out. My parents decided they were going to drug test him from now on, and he could lose his phone, car, and even college if he keeps smoking. Well, John ended up ratting me out to my parents (who had NO idea I'd ever smoked). I think he threw me under the bus to try and make his actions look better. Now, my parents are saying that to be fair, they're going to drug test both of us, and if I test positive they will take my car. My parents seemed like they don't really want to drug test me - in fact, my mom said she would try and tell me in advance of when they would do it - but they want to be ""fair"". Keep in mind, I am still living out of state this summer, so any drug testing would take place when I visit home (which is only going to happen a few times).

&amp;#x200B;

I wasn't planning on smoking the next few months because my internship random drug tests. However, I feel like my parents aren't respecting my decisions and privacy as an adult. It isn't like I still live at home, and weed isn't impacting my life in any way. It was solely my brother's fault that he got caught. Additionally, my boyfriend lives in a state where weed is legal, so really, what do they expect? The only thing that still ties me to my parents is that they own the car I drive. They agreed to let me drive this when I started grad school, as they knew I wouldn't make much money and they valued me furthering my education. However, I pay for everything else myself.

&amp;#x200B;

Do you think my parents are being reasonable? Is it fair to apply John's punishment to me, even though we are at very different stages in our lives? How can I tell my parents I am uncomfortable with this while maintaining a good relationship? And how do I address this breach of trust with my brother? 

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR: My younger brother got caught smoking weed, and my parents plan to randomly drug test him. He snitched to them that I've smoked too, and now they want to drug test me."
"[Update]I (26F)made a pros and cons list about my bf(28M) because I’m desperate for clarity. (Together 3 years.) Is it salvageable?


[Original Post Here](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/bltkvn/i_26fmade_a_pros_and_cons_list_about_my_bf28m/)

So my last post wasn't that big on here, but since a lot of ya'll were very helpful, I wanted to update you guys. 

 I sat my boyfriend down (with a dairy queen blizzard lol) to talk to him about why he stopped going to therapy before we dated, and how his cranky/sad/numb/back to happy days were taking a toll on me, and whether he would consider going to therapy with me. He stopped me there, and told me how he's been feeling the past few months. He told he how exhausted he is from feeling like he's disappointed me. And how he feels like he's walking on egg shells because if he disagrees with me on certain things, I get upset(to clarify- I'm a very sensitive person and if I feel misunderstood in a conversation, I will cry. This has led to him feeling like he can never be blunt or he has to be very careful in how he words things.) Which is totally valid and something I'm gone to therapy for in the past.

It was obvious to me he was wanting to break up from the first few minutes. We spent the next couple hours talking about where we both went wrong and apologized to each other. I told him I was so sorry for making him feel like I wasn't proud of him and made him feel like he couldn't relax or be himself. He told me how sorry he was for letting himself go. He also said he felt like he was holding me back in a lot of ways and that we both seem to be better versions of ourselves when we're by ourselves, which is probably true.

We held each other and cried a lot. He said he has a lot of respect for me and that I was worth every headache and asked me to please never date someone who isn't worthy of my time. I told him if he needed to go to bed or have some alone time to go smoke that was okay, but he said, ""I've left you alone too many times in our relationship. The least I can do is be there for you tonight and hold you."" &lt;--ughh kill me, i love him so much...

I'm beyond devastated but I know this is for the best in the long run. A relationship shouldn't be this hard 3 years in. I had no idea how much of his unhappiness was due to me. It hurts, but now I know what I need to work on going forward. I deeply appreciate him coming out with the truth and initiating the breakup because if I thought he wanted to stay together, I don't think I could have gone through with it. I'm not strong at all. I just set up an appointment with my therapist. I hope he can give me something to help me sleep the next few months because I'm worried how this will affect my attendance at work and such. I'm currently waiting for him to get off work so we can start deciding who is moving out(i told him he could stay but he may be moving back to the town his family is in so idk) and how we're going to tell people. I'm going to miss him so much. I feel like I'm dying and feel so sick to my stomach but I know it will get better in time. I hope he finds happiness going forward, he definitely deserves it.

TL;DR: My boyfriend was questioning our future just like I was and we broke up."
"[UPDATE] Is he (m31) irational or am I (f27) not empathetic enough?


[Original post](https://ud.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/9ovs9s/is_he_m31_irational_or_am_i_f27_not_empathetic/)

We didn't broke up right after I made my post. We had a long conversation, made effort to listen to each other and decided to stay together. We right then planned to move in back together around New Year if everything's ok between us. And everything was good for a month, really good. At the end of November I finally relaxed, we started getting really close to each other again. One night he was extremely affectionate, we fooled around a bit for the first time after three months and later I mentioned moving in. After I told him how I think it's natural next step for us, I asked what are his thoughts. In a really cold manner he held 10 min long monologue how he's good where he is and there's no real reason to move back. I was sad but calm and just accepted what he was saying despite knowing that wasn't what we agreed on. He didn't really understand why am I sad but he let it go after I pleaded him. In short, he promised he will think about it.

Then there was a week long string of his shitty behavior where all of a sudden I was guilty for every little thing. In short, the biggest thing was: I asked him, though nervously, if I can give him my house keys in the town center so I can spend morning with family that arrived for a day instead of waiting him at home til he arrives with his stuff in the early afternoon (he lost his keys to my place); he agreed moths ago that he will there with me, on that date, when my cousins arrive. He could have come over day earlier but first he said he had to work, then when he didn't he said he would rather spend the day at his place and town. It really pissed him off when I asked that... He was irritable whole week after that, acting cold and distant and refused to come to my place as agreed on multiple occasions.
Finally we agreed he will come on Friday (a week after our last talk about moving in). He called me Friday morning, I couldn't really talk so we just exchanged few words (have a nice day etc.). Few minutes later I got text how I am cold and he feels unwelcome every time he needs to come over, how I ruin everything. I responded that if he doesn't want to come or be with me, it's okay, but I am not the problem and I don't want to fight. He is welcome to come if he solves his anger. He called me again and said he had enough and said he will just come over to gather his things. I was really pissed off because this was happening all over again and after 10 of his break up threats during our conversation - I told him I am fine with it. It ended up with him calling me a 100 times that day, I guess he was in disbelief that I (!) decided to break up after a whole month together where everything was good between us. I answered every call hoping he would say the right things but he was angry because his apologies weren't enough, mocking me and saying how he has no problem finding other women, how he was willing to forgive me all my wrongs and how I should do the same for his. At this point apologies meant nothing to me and I was annoyed how easily he would like to let all (his) drama go. Every few day he continued contacting me proclaiming his love etc., claiming he would do everything for me and us and how he changed, how he will always wait for me. He calmed down after a month, I was drawn to it so began calling once a week to see how he is. In February, after 2 or 3 conversations of that type, when I asked why is he willing to wait for me but not willing to actually do something to prove his change, he coldly said if what he already did isn't enough, it can't be helped. He was playing with me all over again and it was a final confirmation for me. He still tried to contact me after, confused how I stopped reaching out but I am not calling, not texting, not answering him for two months now. I truly loved him once but was miserable with him. I am now much happier and much much calmer, filled my life with hobbies, friends and happy thoughts! I am really proud that he didn't manage to convince me to lower my standards even more and destroyed my self esteem. I am tired of drama but I have never been in better state, both emotionally and physically!

tldr He was playing with me again, hot'n cold, I broke up with him, disappointed how he really turned up to be, feeling pretty good."
"Is it fair for me (26F) to breakup with my BF (24M) of nearly 4 years for reasons entirely beyond his control?


He got a promotion at work about 6 months ago which we were both SUPER happy about because he's been passed over a couple times and worked really hard to earn. We knew the hours would change some, and there might be some weekends here or there. We anticipated having to make some changes. 

But, the schedule isn't AT ALL what they told him it would be, and it's not what the previous person in this position had. 

I work 9-530, Mon thru Fri with 1 Sat a month. He was working 7-4 in his old role, with Saturdays for a month 4 times a year. He's now on 4 pm - 1 am Wed thru Fri and 3 pm to midnight on weekends. He's worked *every single weekend* since the promotion, as well as every holiday. 

We literally never see each other. By the time he comes home, I'm in bed. He's still asleep when I leave in the morning. I have most weekends off, he has none. Sometimes we can grab breakfast on the weekends but we can't do any activities together because he needs to leave for work at 2 pm. 

He's asked why he doesn't have the schedule the person he replaced did and was told simply ""We need you on this shift"". He's asked if it was permanent and they told him that yes, this is a 2nd shift position now. When he was first promoted they told him ""a few weeks"" but the schedule never changed. 

He's hesitant about looking for a new job because he's making AMAZING money, and he's unlikely to get immediately back into the same advanced position with a new company. He's looked and even had a couple interviews and that was pretty much confirmed. He got an offer but it was an offer for his OLD role at a different company because he hasn't been in the more advanced position long enough to have the right experience. 

The final nail was when they cancelled his vacation next month. We had a week long trip planned 2000 miles away from home. We had flights and hotels booked, events paid for and now...... pleh. He can't go. He's encouraged me to take a friend, but airline tickets aren't transferrable and flights now are stupid expensive. I also don't know of any of my friends who would WANT to go to these events..... and I wanted to go with HIM.

Even if I did go alone or find an interested friend, like 50% of the trip just gets eaten in what he can't get refunded. 

None of this is really his fault but I'm really feeling like *I can't do this a minute longer*. I'm so incredibly lonely. It's like I now live with a roommate that I never talk to. It doesn't feel fair to breakup with him for something he can't control but this is NOT a relationship. It's barely even a friendship anymore. I can't and wouldn't ask him to take a $5-7/hr pay cut. I know getting some debts paid off is a priority to him. And if anything happened and he left this job for me, he would just be resentful. 

I can't change my shift because my field doesn't generally even HAVE a second shift. 

But there's no end in sight to this and I'm really feeling like if I'm going to be single I'm just going to BE single. 

I love him. But we haven't had a relationship in 6 months. 

I guess I actually AM asking permission to break up. It just makes me feel like a horrible person, so maybe some suggestions of what to say that DOESN'T make it sound like his fault would be good. 

Thanks!

tl;dr BF got promoted and now we have no relationship due to his schedule. I understand his reasons fir wanting to stay in the job, but we just had to cancel an expensive vacation because they cancelled his time off, and I've hit the end of my rope. How can I let him down as kindly as possible so that he understands this isn't his fault but I can't do this?"
"Bf (33) completely snapped and hates everything about me (F26) out of nowhere


Throwaway because this is embarrassing/nsfw.

A few months ago my BF moved from his home state to mine to be with me after 2 years of dating long distance. We are fundamentally different people, but it never caused huge problems. For example, he was homeschooled growing up, never went to college, did a lot of drugs/drinking/partying, got into lots of legal trouble, lots of ex gfs, works blue collar jobs. I always took life/responsibility seriously, never went through a party phase, went to a good university and work a good job in tech. We believed that our differences brought out what was lacking in each others lives (I show him structure, he shows me adventure) and we always enjoyed each others company, traveled, like the same music, same sense of humor, no interest in marriage/kids, etc. 

The jobs he works has him gone half of the year, and after a month of living down here he had to go off to a different state to work. A few weeks ago I brought up the idea of going to visit him on a weekend and he was really rude about it saying that we just saw each other, but ""fine, come up if you have to."" So I dropped that. Side note: he has become pretty good friends with a few of the guys he met on this job, and they go out drinking after work and hang out basically the entire weekend. Every time he says he's going to call me he never does because he gets ""too caught up in the moment"" and says I'm too needy when I have anything to say about it. He never talks to me when he's with them and he is always with them. Anyway, a few nights ago he went out drinking and I called him to say goodnight and he was driving home from the bar (obviously intoxicated). I tried to get him to call an Uber instead but he started getting mad that I was acting like a ""hall monitor"" and he would just call me when he got home. So he gets home and honestly it was like all hell broke loose. 

To sum up the ""conversation"" (aka me sitting there silently in disbelief and him fucking FUMING at me) here are some bullet points and please keep in mind THIS IS THE FIRST TIME I HAVE EVER HEARD ANY OF THIS STUFF IN THE TWO YEARS WE'VE BEEN TOGETHER: 

* the maximum he wants to talk to me is 1 hr a day and that's pushing it
* he has apparently never once enjoyed sex with me. to quote him ""being with me is like being with a mormon and not in a good way because all the mormon's he fucked were 'sexy freaks'"" ........
* he feels that he's a shell of his former self and feels repressed since he's been with me
* to him the most important part of a relationship is ""freaky sex"" and that somehow spreads across other departments and makes a good relationship
* he never brought any of this up before because he was hoping I would change (without knowing there was a problem..)
* to be a good woman I need to send him nudes and cook for him (I don't do either of these because I don't want to send nudes and he always insists on cooking) and if I did those things I would get respect (aka him wanting to talk to me/see me)

That's the gist of it but he has have never ever ever had a discussion with me about being unhappy. Every once in a while he will ask for nudes but I don't want to send them and from that he has gathered that I will never be the kind of ""woman"" he wants. He seriously snapped and will not talk to me with any ounce of respect until I start to respect him aka send nudes. And to add insult to injury, he told me that he went golfing with his friends and told them that I ""suck in bed"" which is completely humiliating to me. I mean ffs, he has never brought any of this up, and the shit he apparently wants me to do is insane shit you only see in weird porn. How was I supposed to become some ""freak"" over night, especially without knowing? 

 I feel really hurt by all of this, and I feel pressured to do shit I'm uncomfortable with because he's apparently on the final straw and I have to somehow save this. And why did this happen out of nowhere? I wonder if he met some hot girl at the bar and turned her down and is somehow blowing up at me with all this built up resentment or something. I have no clue, and he's out with those guys again so idk when we'll talk next or if I even want to.

&amp;#x200B;

Any advice please?

"My (15/F) Father (45/M) Died and I'm Lost


TLDR: My father is dead and I don't know what to do with myself

My father had his first stroke when he was about 40-ish and I was about to start 5th grade. He's made so much progress with speech in his speech group and I was so proud, but he was very unhealthy after the stroke.

He drank Gatorade without exercising, he rarely went to the gym, he spent a lot of time on the couch, he ate a lot of meat.

We tried to get him to be healthier, but I think it was too late by the time he started to get serious.

Last night, he had a second stroke. We (my younger sister [12/F], mother [42/F] and grandfather [68?/M]) spent about 5 hours in the hospital before we were called to the consultation room where we were later told he had a heart attack and didn't make it.

I could not cry and I didn't know why I couldn't. I love him, but that night I couldn't feel sad.

It's the next morning and I don't know what I'm supposed to do. I can't get him out of my head. I've tried to do what I normally do (play games and watch Youtube) but I can't seem to focus.

What am I supposed to do now that he's gone?"
"My (f26) Mom (f55) instigated us having no contact for a year, and now is planning on bringing drama/personal problems to my workplace because I am upholding that no contact


Sorry this is so long but this situation spans over about a year and I am just really upset right now.

 A little bit of backstory first, we’ve always had a patchy relationship, I believe she brings out the worst in me as bad as that sounds. I pretty much raised myself with the help of camps anytime that I had breaks from school because both my parents worked excessively. I moved back home 2 years ago at 24 to finally go to school as I had been managing retail and getting nowhere, and getting frustrated at that. I stayed with her for 6 months while I waitressed and decided where to go for school what to do etc and we fought constantly, sometimes because of me and sometimes because of her. I know that I’m not perfect and two women who are so similar living together gets messy especially because I had already been on my own and am a person who appreciates time to myself a lot. During this I also had a very rough long distance relationship with a boyfriend who was gaslighting me amongst other things, so I was pretty out of it as well.

Anyway, I move 45 min away for school, we keep in touch naturally and I introduce her to my new BF when he comes along, we visit for dinner etc.  She goes on vacations fairly often in the summer for a week or two at a time, and sometimes will offer me the use of her car to watch after her cat, spend time with it etc. Which I love doing because I love her cat. I do this a few times last summer and everything seems fine, and then she asks me again. Okay, no problem, I go pick up the car, my bf drives me out we visit with the cat and then both head home after. A week or so later she messages me saying ‘going to be back tomorrow,need the car for work,I say okay, tell her I’ll be by when she gets in as she had told me what time she was coming in, let’s call it 8pm. Me and my boyfriend had plans to see a concert that night but I told him sorry, have to cancel, not the end of the world, don’t bother mentioning it to my mom.

I leave to go meet her an hour before, it takes about 45min to get there and then when I’m about 10 minute away I get a call from her so I answer and she’s telling me that she actually won’t be back for another few days and to turn around and go home. I get frustrated, and feel it’s very inconsiderate so I mention hey, I had plans tonight you know, planning to tell her that I found it to be pretty inconsiderate but before I can,she’s yelling and talking over me saying ‘how the fuck would I know that’ and ‘I really can’t deal with this shit right now’ etc. I’m crying at this point (I cry quick, drives me crazy) And also still driving which obviously isn’t a good mix so after a few minutes of this I talk over her and say ‘the car will be at your house tonight, it’ll be in the driveway’ and hang up and continue my drive. Luckily my BF comes and picks me up and we go home. 

Ffwd a few weeks of not really speaking with her, she messages me on fb asking me to call her. My bf is picking me up from school and we stop in a hallway before we leave so I can call her. She pretty much reams me out for hanging up on her and saying again that it’s my fault that I didn’t tell her about my plans (which isn’t even really the issue, I had no problem cancelling it’s the inconsideration) and I try to talk to her but again she’s yelling, talking over me etc. And I finally get through to her and say hey, you’re not even listening to what I’m saying, you won’t let me talk so she goes ‘fine talk, I’m listening, say whatever you want’ so I start to tell her that she had been inconsiderate, when I am yet again talked over. She goes on to say that she’s tired of us fighting and that I either need to stop it or ‘get the fuck out of her life’ while also mentioning that the world doesn’t revolve around me and that I am immature and need to grow up. I’m crying (again) at this point and my boyfriend has had enough seeing how upset I am, and he grabs my phone, hangs up, and takes me home as people are around and staring, right after our call she messaged me saying to grow the fuck up and a picture of her motorcycle, crashed, with nothing else.

 I finished school and got asked to join a salon immediately which was amazing for me because I was very stressed and living very tightly. I couldn’t find work when I was in school due to my class hours, so she had lent me money for a few months for rent and a bus pass, right before both phone calls had happened. I dreaded asking for help, partly because I had been supporting myself since I was 17, and partly because sometimes if she helps me out she holds it over my head and guilts me with it, but it needed to be done as I was in a very tight spot.

Since this all happened she has messaged me a few times mentioning that she’s moving, and I needed to come get my stuff, I don’t know which stuff, or how much either. This could include stuff from my childhood, stuff that I had left there when I moved for school thinking I would come back for etc. Whenever I see her name I feel sick and anxious almost immediately and I haven’t responded to her since our phone call which yes is immature, but I haven’t been able to handle it. I would rather lose all my stuff than go to her house to get it, which sounds horrible, but to me it just sounded like a trap and I was very against it. 

She messaged me last night around 1130/midnight saying that she needed my address for my things as she is moving. I didn’t respond because I was in bed but the following messages are ‘real nice’ (as I didn’t respond) and ‘guess I’ll just have to drop your shit off at your work, fine by me’ I work in a high end Salon and am extremely anxious that she’s going to show up at my work and cause a scene. She must have found my work through my professional Instagram, which has the salon listed, I haven’t talked to her since I started there. 

What do I do? I know talking to her is the most obvious answer but I feel so anxious even thinking about it. Not to mention that I am really just okay with us cutting our ties and knowing the conversation would go just like the phone calls. This isn’t a relationship that I enjoy having in my life, it’s always been like this and I feel like I’m ready to just move on. My biggest concern is her getting me into trouble at work but I don’t know how to prevent that while still keeping my distance from her.





TL;DR my mom who I have a horrible relationship with is threatening to go to my work and drop stuff off and I don’t want her anywhere near there, or ideally, to have any contact with her, I know I haven’t been handling this the best but what do I do?"
"My [28F] boyfriend [31M] Of a year and a half has a friend [48F] who will always have problems that make her a priority. I don’t know what to do.


My boyfriend has a troubled past and has moved around because of it. A few years ago he moved here from another state and this particular friend let him stay with her until he got on his feet. He stayed with her around 9 months I believe. Because of this, he feels like he always has to take care of her since she helped take care of him. Also, because of this, I feel he enables her and she takes advantage of it. 

There have been numerous times since we’ve gotten together that I have felt like she’s more important than me. Here’s some examples: 

•he was supposed to go to a wedding with me. He ended up not going because that same morning of the wedding, his friend came to him asking him to fix her car. He didn’t get done until 11 pm that night, so I ended up going alone. 

•one of my really good friends was getting married. He knew about the wedding months in advance. The night before his friend told him that we needed to take her out for her birthday. Same night as wedding. Ended up leaving wedding early because I had to drive them around for her birthday. I explained to him that night that I was upset about it because for my birthday, we didn’t do shit. He said that it was because he had no money. He said he still didn’t have money and shouldn’t be out paying for her drinks but He ended up having a $70 bill just for the two of them. 

•last summer my car battery went out and he ended up buying me a new one. Unfortunately the ONLY one they had for my car was $180. I didn’t have the money at the time but he said he’d take care of it and I could just pay him back. I am a single mom so it takes me awhile to get that kind of money but eventually I got my tax return and immediately he goes “do you think you’ll be able to pay me back now?” Which of course I did. My only problem with this is his friend asks him for money regularly but he never expects her to pay him back. I don’t know if it’s because he just knows she’ll never have the money or what but it bothers me. I have no problem paying him back. I just don’t get why it’s expected of me and not her. 

•she is being evicted from her house and she is moving in with him. Unfortunately, we just found Out today she has to move by tomorrow. Tomorrow is Mother’s Day. I’m a mother. Even though my daughter is not his, he was supposed to come with me to my moms and celebrate with all of us. Now he has to help her move even though she already has 3 other people doing so because he feels he needs to be there for her. 



He said that he feels the need to take care of her because she has no one else. She’s broke all the time because she has 11 animals (dogs and cats, and yes, they are moving in too). She never has money for anything and just last week was asking him to loan her money. Now he’s wanting to move her in to help her out. 


Thing is, I understand 100% that the problems she has is something that needs to be taken care of. She needs to have a car to drive. She needs to have a place to live. She needs to have money. But it just seems like all of these problems come and I’m the one who has to sacrifice. It feels like he’s having to choose between her or me and she will always have a problem that needs to be taken care of ASAP and so that means he needs to choose her. 


I get that these examples and my feelings may be petty but I just can’t help but feel like I’ll never be important to him like she is. He will always drop everything at the drop of a hat to take care of her but I don’t feel he’d do the same for me. My friends will always be biased and be on my side which is nice, but sometimes it’s not what I need. 


Am I being petty and I should learn to just let it go and accept it or what? I just don’t know what to do. I’m so lost. 


TL;DR! my boyfriend has a friend that he will drop everything for even if that means sacrificing time with me and my feelings. I don’t know if I’m just being petty or if basically my feelings are valid. I’m lost on what to do."
"I (27M) am ""happy"" in my relationship. I love my girlfriend (27F), but my physical attraction has faded. When another (attractive) girl gives me attention it sticks with me and I think about them for a long time. I like spending time with them and it feels wrong. Is this normal?


I really do love my girlfriend. She is lovely and gorgeous and the best thing that has ever happened to me. 

Body wise, she has some issues that she is currently struggling with that I will not detail too much here. It is largely not her fault and mostly a result of her genetics and she is dealing with it the best way she can. I respect and understand that and I only want to support her. The issue is that while I accept these things, I find her less attractive than I used to. I have pushed away these thoughts for a long time because it doesn't matter when you love somebody, right?

Well recently I have been struggling with this a little more than usual. A few times in the past few months I have been at social events and have had attention from other girls. It feels really nice. It, frustratingly, feels more satisfying than my OH telling me she loves me etc (maybe because I know that already and take it for granted). I will get on well with these girls and have a good time, of course not cheating, but enjoying their company in a way that I expect my OH wouldn't like. I will not cheat on my OH, though I expect this will be classified as emotional cheating.

My problem is that I don't want to feel this way. I want to be fully satisfied by my OH and I really don't want to lose her. She knows about her body issues and bringing it up would likely crush her because she is trying hard and has low confidence anyway.

Is what I'm going through in any way normal? Have others experienced similar and come through the other side, putting it down to just a ""phase"" of the relationship? What's the best thing for me to do right now?

Tl;dr: less attracted to my OH than I used to be, really enjoying company of attractive girls who give me attention, feeling guilty about this and just want this to end and to be happy with OH. What can I do?"
"My friend [40sF] lied about me and my husband [30sF/M] and I don’t know if I should let it go


Hi Reddit, I am at a loss about this and could really use some perspective. I’m using a throwaway since my Reddit account isn’t super anonymous and I want to protect my friend’s privacy.  
  
I have a friend Ann who I’m close with. We work together and have a lot of fun. She brings out a lighthearted side of me that I really love and it’s rare for me to find someone who makes me feel like a fun and happy person. Ann has her share of issues like anyone else and a huge one for me is that she caters to people who are mean to her. For our friendship this means she’ll flake on me quite a bit if she feels like someone else might get upset with her. I’ve told her it upsets me too even if I don’t yell at her but I am able to set pretty healthy boundaries and overall I really feel the friendship is worth those annoyances.   
  
Some background on the current issue though is, I was working on a project that had me doing 12 hour high stress work days for a month. I desperately needed some fun and planned a day of drinking with her and my husband who would be our DD. We always have a great time with the three of us, and we’d been talking about this all week. Around 1am on that day she texted saying she couldn’t go because she had to help her mom find a dress for an event the next day. She’d been looking for the dress for a couple days but her mom’s closet was a mess and she hadn’t found it. When I woke up and saw that, all my stress just kind of boiled over. I spent that entire morning just crying and unable to do anything.  She texted me in the afternoon and I was honest with her - I hadn’t gone out drinking because it would have just been my husband driving me around while I drank alone which didn’t seem fun, and that I’d really broken down about it but of course the crying was a months worth of stress and not just because of her. She in turn let me know that she felt so bad that she also had broken down crying that she’d ruined my day because she couldn’t say no to her mom.   
  
Fast forward to a week ago, Ann and her boyfriend of one year Bobby went on a weekend trip. While there he got drunk and ended up attacking her in an Uber - he was arrested and has a court date for some kind of domestic violence. He currently lives with her and her parents, and she says she knows she needs to break up with him but she’d prefer if he moves out on his own and then she’ll try to ghost him. I’ve been trying to be as supportive as I can, I’m the only friend she’s told and I don’t want to alienate her right now, but I’ve made it very clear to her that I think she needs to leave him and I point out regularly when she defends or excuses any of his controlling behavior.  
  
With all that fresh in my mind, she invited Bobby out to dinner with us last night. We actually had a pretty good time, superficially anyway. But at the end of the night Bobby started in talking about the day trip. At first I thought he was expressing how bad she felt for ruining my day and I could see her getting upset and telling him to stop. So I told him don’t worry about it, we’ve had our conversations and I’m ok. But he won’t stop talking and eventually I realize he’s confronting me - implying that I got inappropriately mad at her over it. And I see that she desperately wants him to stop talking. But before he does he turns to my husband and mentions something about BOTH of us “coming at” her over it.  
  
Now I will say that maybe she could have retold the story dramatically to make it look like I was angry vs overwhelmed and upset. But my husband was never even involved, never discussed it with her, and from her protests it’s clear that she’d lied and said he was. My husband is an ethnicity that can be associated with angry sexist men, and for someone to accuse him of even verbally attacking a woman is really distressing to him and to me. He’s been a great friend to her and I don’t get why she’d lie about it.   
  
I’m so angry that I’ve been a really good friend to Ann and this is how I’m repaid. I’m angry that some abusive piece of shit thinks he can accuse me of being mean to someone and out of loyalty to her I didn’t stand up and say at least I’m not throwing punches at her and getting arrested. And I’m angry that my husband who is a literal saint is getting dragged into this in any way.  My initial reaction since she hates confrontation was to text her saying we can drop it this time but in the future if there’s any lying about me or my husband that’s the end of our friendship.  But I also know that I’m overwhelmed and lacking perspective on this whole thing.  She’s the first close friend who’s ever confided in me about an ongoing abusive relationship and I’m terrified of doing or saying the wrong thing and making it worse, but I don’t think anyone gets a free pass to randomly lie about me or my husband.  So I guess my question is, do I just let this go or is it worth confronting her? Am I being a bad friend by not giving her leeway when she’s going through this terrible thing?  
  
tl;dr My friend lied to her abusive boyfriend making me and my husband look bad and I don’t know if I should confront her."
"Caught my son(16) kissing another boy(18). Plus I would love to fix our relationship. Independent events by the way.


 My wife and I have two teenage kids a 13 year old girl and a 16 year old boy. Just recently I came home after work to find my son kissing his best friend in his room he didn't see me. Both my son and his friend  has always been the high school jocks, he had girlfriends before and broke up with the last one 7 months ago. Both of them are on the football team and are together 24/7. I would say over the course of this past year, him and his friend have spend a lot of time together.I didn't say anything until his friend left. I did talk to my wife afterwards. 

Lately, it seems all we've been is butting heads. More than usual and it's been affecting our relationship. Now he barley acknowledges me anymore. As a father it hurts when your son doesn't want anything to do with you. I know he's 16 and it's just the age group but I feel as though I'm not close to him anymore. He's very close to his mother and she brought it to my attention that he's starting to hate me- his words to her were ""It's gotten to the point where I don't know why I hate him so much"". That broke my heart. To hear that my son hates me and thinks I don't care about him. I'd like to add that he told my wife about him and his boyfriend months ago. Both of them broke up with their respective girlfriends, so they could be together. Matter of fact, my son has met his boyfriend's parents. It hurts me that I'm not close to him anymore. It physically hurts me.

I love my son no matter what. I don't gay if he's gay, straight, bi, white, black, yellow, red. I  don't care. All I want is for my son to be happy at the end of day.  It hurts me that I'm not close to him anymore. It kills me to discover he basically has a whole another life that I have no idea about hurts. I want my son back.  

I don't know how fix our relationship. He refuses to even talk to me anymore. Heck I'm lucky if I get a ""hello"" and ""goodbye"". They're nights that I cry thinking about what our relationship once was and what it's now become. 

 TL;DR: I desperately want to fix the relationship with my teenage son"
"My stepmom (50F) keeps trying to get into my (19F) Laptop (PLEASE HELP)


My stepmom has tried to get into my laptop once previously. I know this because every time she does it, she take off the tape I have over my camera (don't judge me ok).

A few nights ago I told both my dad (53M) and my Stepmom that I'm going to be meeting up with my boyfriend (21M) that I met online. They're nervous about it and are begrudgingly letting me see him, which I understand why they would be worried as its some internet stranger to them. We discussed this though and everything seemed like it would be ok.

Last night my stepmom tried to get into my computer twice when I was away from it. I asked my Dad why she was doing this and he said ""She was trying to look up something"" which I know is bullshit because she has her own laptop and my dad has one too in the same room.

She's obviously trying to look through my computer to go through my discord messages between me and my boyfriend which I would REALLY rather her not do. It's extremely invasive. I know that if I talk to her about it she'll pull the whole ""Oh well what do you have to hide from us?"" thing which is unfair. I shouldn't have to share private conversations between me and my boyfriend with my parents.

My parents also bought me this computer as a gift so I see where they're coming from if they say that it's technically their's but at the same time I feel like I should be able to have some privacy. It kinda just makes me want to give them the $300 it cost to get them to leave my stuff alone.

&amp;#x200B;

Tl;dr I need a way to tell my stepmom to not go through my computer or have a way to better protect my computer from her if she guesses my password correctly."
"My (30M) girlfriend (30F) just told me she was an escort for several years.


I've been dating a girl for four months and we have grown very close in that time. I met her off of Bumble, she asked me out because she could see that we were both non drinkers in the recovery scene (both of us are ex junkies who have been clean for over a few years now). We have alot in common and both us have no shortage of shit we are ashamed of in our pasts.

For some context, I'm a late bloomer in the dating scene. I was always very shy (and fucked up on junk) when I was younger and the only relationships I've had have been with women from work who instigated and pursued me. I've come out of my shell in recent years (got a good job in the OR which women seem to like) and for the first time I started dating widely. This was big for me because I always felt sexually inexperienced next to other people. I had a plan to just date and be up front and honest with women that I wasnt looking for anything serious and try sleeping around for awhile. I did it for awhile and it was great.

It was during this period that I met my gf. We instantly got attached and my whole ""just date around"" plan went out the window. Its been a really great intimate few months with her, we hang out and talk everyday,  and then last night she said she needed to talk to me about something. She told me that she had been a call girl for an escort agency for several years and that she did it to support her heroin habit. I didnt know what to say or how to react.

I told her that I still adored her and didnt think less of her and that I appreciated she trusted me enough to tell me. She cried though, she said she is always afraid no one will want to be with her because shes too damaged. No matter what I said to reassure her she said that I wasnt looking at her the same and I feel like shit and wish it wasnt true but it is.

I am not against sex work in anyway, I have female friends from recovery who spent time in that line of work and I am sympathetic to how  people end up in that situation. I also think consenting adults should be allowed to do whatever they want sexually.  I would never hold someones sexual history against them and I dont think less of her for doing it, it just makes me feel sad. I did some extreme shit for money as well when I was using, there just wasnt a sexual element.

Despite all of that and the fact that I know intellectually that this shouldnt be a problem I cant stop thinking about it. Her telling me conjures up horrible images in my mind about her with other men like that. I have had friends who would go to see escorts and I keep thinking 'have any of my friends been with her like that?'  and it tears me up inside. I know its not really rational but I cant get those thoughts out of my head. I came home from her place today and just started sobbing when i got home.

The problem is not a judgement of her, its a weakness of mine. When I think about it it makes feel insecure and sad. I cant get the images out of my head, its kind of torture,  and I dont know how to proceed or if I should proceed. Should I use this as an opportunity to work on sexual insecurities or should I step out of the way so she can find someone better that wouldnt be bothered by this? Any feedback or anyone that might relate would be really appreciated. 






TL;DR my gf told me she used to be an escort and it has made me very insecure and as much as I like her and still respect her I dont know if I can continue the relationship and I feel like a terrible person because she is a wonderful person who has had a hard life and she deserves better."
"I (26f) resent my family for making me move home when one of my parents got really sick.


This in all likelihood makes me seem like an asshole and I feel like an asshole. I was living in Berlin for two years, having a great time. There I had tonnes of great friends, a pretty ok job, a nice apartment and a relationship. I really felt like this was me starting my real adult life

During that time, my mother got cancer. I travelled back and forth almost every month to visit, but it became apparent that this was not going to be sufficient. My dad who has always had an explosive temper made zero effort to support my mother and just continued to be difficult to live with. Nobody helped with house work or cooking, it was all left to her despite my dad and brother being there. Eventually my mother started ignoring my calls and getting her friends to tell me how awful I was for not coming home, and also told me she would not continue with her treatment if I didn't come home and start training on the career path she wanted. So I did move home, left my entire life behind.

Fast forward a year, and my mother is clear from cancer which is great but has been left with significant health problems from the treatment which will be lifelong. My brother has now moved out, and I am stuck at 26 living with my parents. I am in an extremely high powered job that leaves me exhausted but rent is too expensive in my city to merit paying. My home country/city is so small that everyone knows everyone, it's very homogenous in terms of who lives there (compared to Berlin which had so much diversity) and there is very little to do. I have no real friends outside of colleagues I don't particularly like, and no prospect of a relationship because the gay scene is non existent here. I have never felt so lonely in my whole life.

For the past year I've basically just worked and stayed in my room all weekend to avoid my constantly arguing parents. I feel like my life has drawn to a halt and there's no way out. I can't quit my job for another two years , can't move back to berlin, can't afford to rent here. I'm just overwhelmed with regret and I find myself so angry at my family for taking everything away from me and then feeling horribly selfish for being angry

Tldr : my life was great abroad, my mom got cancer so I moved back in with them, now she is mostly recovered but I am trapped here and incredibly angry at everyone"
"How do I (29M) move past my partner's (30F) quasi-infidelity?


I’ve been with my partner for 4 years and our relationship has been extremely strong. We have recently been discussing marriage and next steps in our relationship. We also have been discussing the idea of involving a third person in our sexual relationship, but have kept it strictly a fantasy. However, the conversations have naturally emboldened her to be a bit more flirtatious, especially with other women. 

Last week we attended a house party with a new group of friends. One attendee (30sF) seemed to respond positively to my partner’s flirting, most of which happened with me present and was limited to typical alcohol-fueled compliments and friendly physical contact - nothing aggressive.

A short time later I can’t find my partner and the other woman has also disappeared. Several friends mention that they left together. I can’t reach my partner via text or phone but try to be cool - I trust her and they might have stepped out to go buy more drinks or get away from the noise. Finally, about an hour later, my partner responds and says she’s up the road at another bar having a drink and conversation. She suggests that I go home and we exchange a few text messages where I tell her I’ll wait for her to get back. An hour goes by and I joke: “Are you hooking up?” My partner replies “Yes” and insists that I just go home and she’ll be over soon.

&amp;#x200B;

At this point I’m feeling very upset, so I do head home from the party. While I think it's unlikely that they actually are hooking up, I'm angry and hurt because we have had a explicit conversations about how meeting somebody at a party and going off with them not be acceptable behavior for either of us, regardless of gender. About 5 hours later she comes back and gets ready for bed. I ask her directly what happened and she says that they didn’t hook up, they just went and met a different group of friends for the rest of the evening. I’m still very upset and, after she has fallen asleep, I make the mistake of checking her phone.

They’ve exchanged a few text messages after my partner left about how my partner is going to be in trouble coming home so late. The other woman responds suggesting my partner stay at her house. The next day I mention to my partner that I want to discuss the issue when we are both home from work. We do some chores and eat dinner when we get home, and I again sneak a look at her text messages. I’m shocked to discover that she has deleted all of her conversations with the other woman.

When we start discussing the events of the previous evening I ask her several times, point blank, about the message suggesting my partner stay at the other woman’s house. She denies such a message exists until I quote the messages at her. I ask her if she can check her messages to see if I’m quoting them accurately and she makes a scene of looking through her phone for a few moments before saying it seems like the conversation was deleted. Later she admits that she did delete the conversation because she often deletes conversations that she's unlikely to revisit in the future.

&amp;#x200B;

At this point I explain that whether or not she actually hooked up is not the problem that has me feeling upset. That the problem was the way she treated me the moment somebody else flirted with her, and that the messages debacle has further destroyed my trust. She agrees with me that, if the roles were reversed, she would not tolerate such because from me. She is currently staying with friends.

I don’t know what to believe or how we can resolve this. I highly doubt that any physical infidelity occurred, but the way everything else transpired makes me feel a host of negative emotions and destroyed my trust.

&amp;#x200B;

Is it possible to rebuild?

&amp;#x200B;

tl;dr - My partner left an event with somebody else for quite a while, joked about hooking up, deleted messages. I don't know if it's possible to rebuild trust."
"I [26F] found out that I was my boyfriend's [28M] last choice


TL;DR is just the title. Boyfriend asked out every single possible girl he knows before asking me out.

Long story, I moved to a new city last year to start a new job. I instantly clicked with a small group of colleagues, who happen to be very active in a sport I enjoy. I met the entire community in the area that way. Three months ago, my now boyfriend asked me out for the first time, and we just started seriously dating. Over the weekend a bunch of my friends I met this way and I were out sitting and talking around a large fire, when one of them joked about it finally working out for *Dan. I asked what that meant, and my boyfriend got obviously uncomfortable and embarrassed but everyone started ragging on how he has asked out every single girl in the group and most of the girls in our office, and pretty much has been rejected every single time. And then he finally got to me, and it worked obviously. I'm feeling really upset, one because I am literally his last possible choice, but also by the fact that he seems extremely embarrassed about it and definitely did not want me to hear any of it. He's still the same great person, but I almost kind of feel icky somehow? I feel so bad for feeling like this :( Do I bring it up to him ever or just pretend to not remember?"
"My (28F) boyfriend (35M) doesn't want me to go to college


My parents have been pressuring me to go to college and honestly I'm sick of working shitty call center jobs or fast food.

Were both currently jobless, he has unemployment while he's looking for a new job and I'm not interested in applying for the same crappy jobs I've been working; I want to go to college so I can work my dream job and actually make good money. He already has an Associates in one field but I feel like I'm stagnating by not getting an education for myself. 

Every time I bring it up though he says I can't or shouldn't go, citing that we can't afford it. My dad offered to pay off my tuition once I'm done though.

Does anyone think he could just have an ulterior motive? Why does he get to go to school but I don't? I'm going anyway because our situation hasn't improved in a long time. 

TL;DR: Boyfriend doesn't want me to get an education because we can't afford it, despite my dad offering to pay the whole tuition once I graduate. 

How can I communicate this to him nicely? Thanks!"
"My dad (36M) has quit his job to become a paranormal investigator. He keeps asking me (15M) for money and refuses to go back to work.


I think I should start off by saying I live with my mom full time. I always forget what it's called, but she's the person who looks at dead people and determines how they died. She's taking care of me. I'm not under my dad's care. I work at skateboard store in the mall. I work 2 days after school and one day over the weekend. Although that's going to change now that summer is coming up. I should work more. 

My dad has quit his job to become a paranormal investigator. I really don't care what anyone thinks about the paranormal. Whatever you want to believe, you do you. Believe in bigfoot? Whatever. As long as it's not hurting anyone, I really don't care. My dad and his buddies got this stupid idea to quit their jobs and become paranormal investigators. It's so fucking stupid because that's his only source of income. He and his friends are working on a documentary on some canyon in the middle of Arizona that's haunted. He's walking around the Arizona desert chasing ghosts. I don't know if this is a midlife crisis or what, but something changed in him. 

I haven't really told mom about what he's been doing when it comes to me. She hates dad. He hit  her when I was four when he was drunk. She divorced him. He got help and later in life she decided to let him be in mine and my sister's life. She doesn't talk to him. She only talks to him when it's relevant to me or my little sister. He's lucky to get a hello from her. She really does hate him. 

I see my dad twice a month. Normally my sister and I see him for a day. He asks me for money every time I see him. He owes me around $970 right now with how much I've given him because he's running through his saved money. He won't go back to work because he wants to chase this, but he keeps asking me for money. My sister wants me to tell mom, because she thinks dad's using me. She says I'm way too trusting of people. 

**TL;DR: Dad keeps asking me for money. Need advice**"
"My (27m) girlfriend (25f) is being manipulated and it's ruining my life.


Me (27m) and my girlfriend (25f) have been together over three years.

While I was at work last night, someone from the pub she used to work at called her and told her that I had recently met up with another of her ex colleagues with the intention of sleeping with her. 

This ""informant"" said I smoked a spliff with the girl, and tried to justify sleeping with her by saying that mine and my girlfriends relationship is basically over.

Not a shred of this is true, I've never even spoken to this girl without my girlfriend right beside me. Someone close to my girlfriend is feeding her lies and trying to break us up, I dont know who or why.

I told her to speak to the girl in question, but all she says is that it won't help her because I've probably already spoken to her and told her what to say. 

I'm heartbroken and dont have a clue what to do, and worried that someone she thinks is a friend is making up potentially life ruining lies to manipulate her with God knows what motives. 

Any advice would be hugely appreciated.

TL;DR - Someone is feeding my girlfriend lies about me and one of her ex colleagues, and trying to break us up."
"My (37M) wife's (31F) best friend is using us as her daycare


My wife and I have 3 kids, aged 5, 3, and 1. All are at daycare. Her best friend who lives down the street just had her first. Throughout her pregnancy, we kept encouraging her to check out daycares early and to get in line because these days it's not necessarily easy getting a spot. At least in our experience. She kept insisting that it would be fine since her mom was willing to watch her baby. But we were always suspicious about how effective this plan would be since her mom has a lot of health issues and is in and out of the hospital. 

Her baby is now 3 months old, and lo and behold... her mom just told her she needs to go to the hospital and can't watch the baby. She started to look for a daycare but as we expected, everything around us was all booked up. Ours is filled too. So what happens? 

She decides to ask my wife for help. What's funny (not funny) is the reason she thinks we are an option is that I work from home. Even if we were saints, everyone who has had a kid or has a brain knows you cannot watch a 3 month old baby and work at the same time. Because she literally HAD to go to work, my wife begrudgingly accepted on my behalf, and so for the last 4 workdays I have taken care of this baby (for free) while trying to maintain my work schedule. Shocking. I still can't believe it. I didn't do this for my own kids. Because I've ""made it work"", her friend actually believes this is a sustainable solution. 

The naïveté and selfishness of this woman blows me away. This morning I told her no, locked my doors, and refused to answer the door. She responded by leaving the baby carrier on my doorstep and loudly announcing she was leaving. Frankly, this was so irresponsible I could have called the authorities but since it's my wife's best friend I can't do that. What I really need is for my wife to step up and say no, but this has always been their relationship dynamic. Any ideas what I should do? I'm at wits end. 

Tldr; wife's best friend thinks I'm an acceptable alternative to a daycare service because I work from home."
"Guy [27M] I'm [26F] dating, doesn't like my hair extensions.


Hi Reddit!

&amp;#x200B;

I'd be happy to hear from anyone here, but I'm mostly really curious to hear from other POC and those in interracial relationships. 

For those with kinky black hair,  how difficult and time-consuming it can be to manage, kind of comes with the territory. To mitigate this and be more versatile with my hair, I choose to style my hair in braids/weaves/and lately, wigs. They look pretty natural and it's generally pretty difficult for most to know that they're not my real hair (especially, those who are unaware of the nuances of black hair).

Recently, I started dating a new guy who I really like. He also happens to be white, and with that - came a learning curve about my hair, how I style it, and manage it. I let him know early on, that I wear a wig most of the time, with my real hair tucked underneath. This is called a ""protective style"", and is aimed at protecting my real fragile hair; it also helps decrease detangling time and rough manipulation, etc. on a daily basis. After I let him know, he was pretty curious and asked a bunch of questions; including, ""why don't you just wear a fro?"", etc. And...I've found it challenging to explain to him why my hair, as is, isn't ideal hairstyle for me. Aside from the maintenance, a fro would require, there's still a lot of social stigma about black hair in its ""natural"" kinky state. Black hair, and its history, is a complicated matter, and it's not just as simple as, ""just wear your natural hair"". Granted, wigs make it impossible for him to comfortably run his fingers through my hair/access my scalp. And from his POV, I could see why this would be frustrating.

He has hinted since that he would like to see me wear my natural hair. This isn't my ideal, and IS NOT when I feel at my most attractive. But, on our most recent date, I figured, ""what the heck"". And long story short, he liked it. BUT, I didn't. I don't hate my hair or anything, but...I like my wigs! I think I look good in them, and they make me feel happy. Not to mention, they're low-maintenance, and more versatile than my natural hair. 

He's mentioned that he prefers my natural hair over the wigs. But, that he's also not fond of braids/woven hair (which honestly, would be the most ideal choice for me after wigs). And...while I'm happy that he likes my natural hair, wearing my natural hair, full-time is just...not a sustainable option. I'm not sure how to break this to him. I'm also worried about whether he'll find me unattractive in wigs/if I ever wear braids. I know that he finds me attractive, and liked my hair BEFORE realizing it was a wig. But, I now know that he may l feel differently. How do I broach this topic with him?

&amp;#x200B;

tl;dr: guy I'm dating doesn't like wigs, weaves, etc."
"I (23F) do not want to tell my deployed husband (29M) our son has a fractured skull.


TL;DR : My spouse is deployed and our infant suffered an accidental head injury. I am scared to tell him due to communication issues and his lack of understanding. 

&amp;#x200B;

My spouse(29M) and I(23F) have been together 4 years, married 2. We have a 3-year-old and 5-month-old son. A few days ago, my son had rolled off the couch onto the hardwood floor. I immediately evaluated him and took him to ER where they basically told to me to relax and he looks great. Later that evening after checking him every hour or so I found a soft lump on his skull. Back to the ER we go.. 

&amp;#x200B;

Well this time things got very real. After speaking to the Dr. about the possibility of a fracture and brain bleed, I lost it. I couldn’t breathe. Almost 4 years of doing this mom business on my own I have never had to experience the guilt. CT results revealed a small fracture but no bleeding. We were discharged and reassured it was pretty common and he will be perfectly fine. 

&amp;#x200B;

My husband missed it all. He always does. He was never there when my daughter fell down or scraped her knee, yet I hear about it over and over when he gets angry. He uses my guilt as a tool to hurt me when he wants to win an argument. He cannot see new perspectives, and really lacks at understanding anything I go through. We struggle with communication when he is home and our relationship has been in a bad spot for a while now but we are both so busy to help it. 

&amp;#x200B;

Now he is gone and I have to figure out how to tell him over email that his son has a skull fracture because I stepped away to grab a diaper. I don’t think he will ever forgive me."
"My wife (37/f) lacks ambition and has zero confidence. She works but earns less than minimum wage, does no housework, etc. I (34/m) feel like I'm 90% of the marriage and starting to feel trapped, like it will never change. What would you do in my shoes?


First off, let me say that I love my wife a lot. But, I'm starting to feel trapped and wonder if she's ever going to improve and grow as a person/spouse. We have no children and I'm the only one who wants them.

We started dating when we were both in college. We were together for 4 years before marriage and have been married for about 7 years now in total. I had never really been in a long-term relationship before my wife. I had dated once in high school as a freshman but that lasted all of about a month. I was bullied sophomore year and never really recovered as it shattered my confidence and took many years to come out of my shell. I started becoming more outgoing in college. Eventually I met my beautiful wife and lucked into getting along very well with her in spite of my lack of social skills with women. 

She's beautiful and emotionally very supportive of me and has always been. She's never tried to hold me back and has been supportive of me trying to get my feet on the ground with my career. The problem is she's depressed, lacks any confidence or self-esteem with herself and is essentially a shitty roommate at this point who doesn't contribute to anything other than being an emotionally supportive friend that I can talk to. We have sex maybe once every 5-6 weeks . I feel like it's a parent/teenager relationship more than an equal one between two adults.

I've grown a lot in my career and as a person, but she's still stuck at zero. She slacked off too much during college so her GPA was atrocious coming out of school, so her plans for grad school and a career went down the tubes. She had no backup plan and has not been able to get back on her feet since then.

She does work now, but for her family's business and effectively makes less than minimum wage as it's very small (that's another long-story in itself, yes I know she needs to take a second job and/or leave the family biz). Because of this, I pay for everything: Bills, rent, food, our cell phones, her health insurance, etc. She only has one bill she tries to pay on her own and she often can't pay it. It's not rare that she asks me for money for something. She's frugal and isn't wasteful (thank God), but it's still annoying. She's never once paid a single bill that wasn't solely hers during the entire ~7 years of marriage. I've paid for everything. It's the worst of both worlds: She works and makes no money.

She does very little chores around the house. She makes the bed every morning and once in a blue moon she'll sweep, but that's it. She's a pack rat and will end of up having piles of crap everywhere... she's diagnosed with ADHD and takes medication. I had to hire a professional organizer to help her declutter because she was so paralyzed to even get started, but it's still a mess in some areas  of our home. Because she doesn't clean I also recently hired a cleaning service who has so far come once.

So she works but makes no real money and is always broke. Because she works for the job that earns her no money, she says she's too tired to clean... or just doesn't do it because she's paralyzed, depressed, and feels overloaded. I have no problem cleaning myself, and I end up doing most of it. I do the dishes, put things away, do laundry, etc. She doesn't cook so I cook all of my own food. I don't mind being domestic (a ""Mr. Mom"" without kids) so to speak, especially if the spouse was helping out financially, but she doesn't even do that.

She's seen therapists for at least 12-15 years, if not longer. But she's still depressed and still has zero ambition. She has no goals, no plans, doesn't want children... but will potentially have them because I want them. I'm super ambitious and career-focused, while keeping a great work/life balance. I'm very romantic, always wanting to go out together to eat or do something or meet with friends. I always take us on nice trips together each year, often as a gift on a special holiday or occasion. Her idea of a gift is an Amazon Gift Card like she's an aunt living 3 states away and not someone spending every day with me. She never wants to go out and be around people, she'd rather sit and binge watch Netflix. Being introverted in itself isn't bad, but in context it's worrisome.

I'm finally a lot more confident in myself and am 100% independent and don't have to rely on anyone. I think I make a pretty decent catch and believe I settled way too quick when I was a young man. I love her, I just don't know if I can help her or if it will ever change. That saying, *""You can't love someone who doesn't love themselves""* is ringing in my ears. So, I'm wondering if I should continue to be there for her and hope she improves. Or, if due to the 7 years we've been together, if that's enough time to know it'll never get better with her, and to stop selling myself short on what a happy successful marriage should be.

I do have my own therapist who is helping me work through these issues. I am also going with her soon to have a session together with her therapist. A lot of this I've held back from telling my wife on how frustrated this all makes me because she can't handle any criticism and immediately begins the waterworks, so I realize now I've been enabling her by being overprotective of her fragile ego.

**TL;DR - Wife is great for emotional support, but is depressed and doesn't contribute financially or with household chores, and has no greater goals or ambition. I'm scared she'll be a bad parent and will never improve.**

I thought and ask the community here: What would you do in my shoes? Please ask any clarification questions you have!"
"I (34F) am getting concerned sister-in-law (30F) might be faking pregnancy


My sister-in-law (SIL) is currently 36 weeks pregnant.  However I’m starting to get worried she might not actually be pregnant.  SIL has struggled to conceive for years.  This will be their first child.  I sincerely hope that I am 100% wrong. 

So reasons I’m worried:

1.  She isn’t showing.  At all.  Not even a mini bump.  I know all women show differently, but are there any (very thin) women who have zero bump at 36 weeks? 

2.  She never knows how many weeks along she is when someone asks.  Unusual, but alone wouldn’t concern me.  

3.  She doesn’t let my brother go to appointments with her.  She said it makes her uncomfortable for him to see her like that (that was never specified).  

4.  She had no ultrasound photos.  She said they did one and didn’t give her a copy.  

5.  She said her doctor is planning a c-section for a specific date (two weeks before her due date).  She doesn’t want my brother there during the birth because she said he gets faint from blood.  He has kind of a weak stomach, but there is a drape and stuff.  Like you don’t have to see the blood.  

TLDR: concerned sister in law is faking pregnancy, some weird signs like not allowing her husband to go to doctor and no ultrasound photos"
"My [29M] girlfriend [25F] got mad at me for asking her to add my name to her bank account that she wanted us to share and deposit our money into.


Me and my girlfriend recently moved in together properly. She lived with me prior, for the remainder of my lease for 6 months, after she ran from her parents home (ran is the best way to put it). I kept paying for everything as I was prior to her moving in, and had her just cover groceries.

We recently found and signed a lease together. She came up with the idea of using this bank account she had, as a shared one. We would both deposit our share of the monthly expenses we agreed upon, into that account. She also got a credit card from that bank and wanted to add me as an authorized user on the Credit card. All was well, I didn't have any complaints whatsoever. 

As we were talking about the account the other day. I passively asked her to add my name to the shared account (as I thought this was something that should've been done already). She threw up an eyebrow. She wanted to understand why I was asking for that. I told her simply, since this is our shared account it only makes sense my name would go on it as well. She didn't like that answer we argued a little then time passed.

Today the topic came up again and I asked for the same thing. This time she is pressuring me to give her the real reason why I'm asking for this. I don't know what other reasons beside the fact that this is supposed to be a shared account, it only makes sense. This grew into a large fight. She tells me she feels hurt, she feels as if I'm indicating that I think she'll steal my money (WHAAAAT???). 

I'm sitting here lost and confused. To me this shouldn't be a conversation. The fact we are going to share an account, where we're both depositing money. Shouldn't it go without saying, that my name should be on the account as well. It's not whether I trust you or not, it's the principle of the matter. And of course I trust her. I have given this girl $1000 before when she needed, without even asking when I will have it back. That was before we dated. (She gave it back)

Am I wrong here? Did I offend without realizing? I'm always open to learn and apologise when I'm wrong.

I'm pissed now because she has this tendency of saying the worse shit to me when she's mad. She stormed off telling me how much she hates me, hates every second with me. Not the first time she's said this (This is for another post).



TLDR; GF got mad because I asked her to add my name to an account she has and wanted us to use as a shared account. Where I would be depositing money into. Said she feel like I asked because I don't trust her."
"My (28M) wife (31F) is a violent alcoholic and I have left


Obligatory apologies on a mobile, poor formatting etc

Throwaway as i think she knows i use reddit.
(Im in Cork in Ireland for any specific legal issues)
I finally reached my breaking point. I have been married for 5 and a half years after being with her since I was 18.

She drinks nearly every day. She hits me with shoes and with bottles of whiskey, wine or whatever she finds in the vicinity. Not every time she drinks. Sometimes she just passes out and I have to look after her.

Im very isolated as I work in a very stressful job, and she has slowly taken away any contact with my friends and limited my contact with my family.

She had previously said she would stop drinking, and did for a while things and were good like they were at the start.
But its so much worse now. I cant keep this up anymore. She hit me pretty hard last week and i ended up in the hospital with a broken nose.

We own a house, share a bank account and have 2 beautiful dogs (no children).
I have left and gone to stay with one of my friends on his sofa.

I dont know if im asking for advice or if im just venting.
I dont even know how im supposed to feel right now

"Getting married soon. Most of my friends aren't coming. It keeps ruining my mood when I just want to be excited about the wedding.


My fiancé and I have been dating for 9 years and have done long periods of long distance during this time. We are crazy excited to finally get married and start our life together. 

The guest list was the only thing we really fought about during planning because we come from larger families and also had pictured a small-ish wedding. Every friend we added to the guest list was someone we really wanted to have there. Some were people I had to fight to include. 

We've been engaged for a year and set our date 10 months ago. My friends got save the dates, were invited to the bridal shower and the bachelorette party, and have all received invitations with plus ones. Outside of my bridal party, not one friend could go to shower or bachelorette, which I understood completely. Now that RSVPs are due in, they are all no's without any excuse or we still haven't received the RSVP and I'll waiting for a text/call back. I haven't argued or fallen out with any of these people. We've moved away from each other and text periodically. 

Outside of the bridal party, only one friend is coming to the wedding and she isn't bringing a date. I feel so bad that none of her friends are coming that I want to call and ask if she's sure still wants to be there.

The last week I've been tracking down the people who didn't respond and every time I hear a definitive no (which I was already expecting at this point) it completely ruins my mood for a chunk of the day. I'm walking around feeling like all my friends are closer with one another than they are with me. I'm also embarrassed that out of all the family and friends on the guest list, the largest group of no's are my friends. One friend is getting married soon after me and I can't shake the feeling like I'll see the whole group there.

Most of these people are friends from school that I hardly see anymore and would've needed to travel. Part of my disappointment is that I was excited to get to see them again. I'm also aware that it's natural for people to drift apart when you aren't in school anymore. 

Reddit, I just want to be happy and excited for my wedding. I want to enjoy my time with everyone who IS coming because I have many loved ones who will be there for the big day. I'm also getting the smaller wedding I had actually dreamed of. Do you have any perspective to help me shake off the hurt feelings knowing that I fought to include a bunch of people who aren't coming? I'm still tracking down a handful of people who are probably no's. How do I not let their answer ruin my mood?

TLDR: Feelings hurt that so many friends aren't coming to my wedding. I want to not care and just be excited but it keeps bringing me down."
"Is my fiancée setting up uncomfortable scenarios on purpose to upset me?


I am a 35(f) and my fiancée is a 40(m). We have been living together for 8 months and in the past 4 months it seems like another side to his personality is coming out. I can’t tell if this is him gaslighting me, if I’m overreacting, if I’m creating problems or if he has a personality disorder.  At any rate something feels off.  This is long. 

The first incident;  I went on his account and saw that he had messaged his ex girlfriend. She lives in another state and he told her he still loves her. I checked a month later and he told her that he missed her. She never responded and he has not messaged her again since February.  I didn’t confront him because I felt like I shouldn’t have read that and maybe he was having a moment of weakness. 

The second incident;  We went to his job for dinner and he was hugging his female coworkers. It was supposed to be our date night but instead all he wanted to do was socialize with his coworkers. Later I checked his phone and he had texted his female coworker before we had went to dinner. He wanted to make me mad by him hugging her. She didn’t want to. 

The third incident;  We were having a romantic night together at home and suddenly he decides to send his female coworker a message and call her. I don’t believe anything is going on between them but it ruined the mood of our night. I thought it was very strange for him to suddenly get an impulse to text someone. 

The fourth incident;  On his birthday his ex girlfriend’s sister and mom had texted him and then I found him on my front porch having a video chat with them.   I get that people can sometimes remain friends with their exe’s family but I believe he knew exactly how I would feel about that.  He introduced me on the video chat and they looked surprised. I believe he had set up that situation to make me feel uncomfortable. 

The fifth incident;  He posted on Facebook that he was waiting for his drink at the bar where he works. Typically he comes home after work but I’ve found out that on the days he gets off early, he sits at the bar and has 2 or 3 drinks. Over an hour went by and I finally called him asking when he would be home and asked why he didn’t call to say he was running late. He went on and on and turned my request into a “why don’t I trust him” conversation. Then he informed me that his coworker wants him to go over to his house to drink one night. Which would be 10pm. He said I could come with him or he would just take a cab home.  This is the opposite of how he said he was when we first met. 

I feel like he creates scenarios that causes us to have these huge discussions. He is also very obsessed about me changing my hair color, hair style and wearing makeup.  I also noticed that he doesn’t respond to me if I comment or ask a question on his Facebook but he will with other people. He says how much he loves me and wants to marry me. I’m not sure what to think about this anymore. 

TL;DR:  My fiancé seems to set up scenarios that cause me to get upset. I feel like he does this on purpose. Am I overreacting or is there something a matter with him?"
"UPDATE: I'm (26F) falling for my casual sex partner (32M) when I didn't mean to


 ( [Original Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/acdu8s/im_26f_falling_for_my_casual_sex_partner_32m_when/) ) Thanks for the insightful and honest replies, friends. I decided to wait it out and we have gradually become closer. I feel a deep trust within him which is has never happened before. I've had time to learn more about myself and what I want in my life, regardless of intimate relationships.  


 That being said, we've had many moments where I felt the need to confess my feelings, but I held back. I had a friend drunkenly encourage me to be honest with myself and I finally got my head out of my ass and went for it. I asked him if he wanted to ""go steady"" to which he replied with,   
""I do and I don't.""  
 Felt a bit crushed with that response, but I said we could come back to it another time. But, he was really kind about it and expressed that with all of the new projects going on in his life, he didn't want to have me feel as though I wasn't getting enough attention. I was relieved to say the least. I assured him that I support everything that he does in his life and find him to be an inspiring person and that I could certainly honor that space that he needs. He told me that if that's the case, then I can call him his boyfriend.   


So, in the past month, that's what I've been doing! It's been so nice not to hold back as much. I still have to get used to the idea and let myself just be who I am and trust that he's digging it. It felt comforting to know that he was only hesitant because he wanted to keep being himself and to make sure that I didn't feel deprived. I was taking it so personally beforehand, so it really took a weight off of my shoulders. I like him for who he is and I don't have any expectations beyond that.   


I don't often hear of these situations ending smoothly, so I thought an update might be a good idea.  


 TL;DR caught feels and professed said feels in the lamest way and good stuff happened?!"
"My mom (F45) asked me to give her my son so she can addopt him and lied about him and told people she addopted him from an orphanage


Backstory first since it's my first ever post: I (F24) have a son (M1), his father is on another continent since we met during school 3 years ago and decided to keep the the child and raise him. Due to financial issues for the past 2 years he wasn't able to return to us, we keep in touch tho. He isn't the problem since he stands up for me and tries to calm me down and all, this is just backstory. 


My mom (F45) is my problem, since I was a kid nothing I did was good enough for her (I'm the black sheep), when my son was born she asked me to give him to her for addoption so I can ""continue to play the role of a student in a big town"", of course I declined. She dragged us to my hometown where I had to live with my family, she also demanded on monthly payments of 60% or more of my income to savings for our future since they provide everything I need which doesn't actually happen because I always bought food and other stuff for the house hold on top of my sons needs. 
 
This addoption thing keeps popping up and I eventually ended up moving in with my grandmother further away from the city. She visits us every weekend and it drives me nuts. All she does is point out how uncapable I am, how I'm a fat loser (a bit overweight really), how I can't raise my son and many more. I also have some mobility issues(sciatica) that I haven't yet treated due to not being able to see a kiropractor being far from any major cities and she gives me hell for walking funny. 


When my son was 2-3m old we talked about me going back to school in one way or another and I started preparing for my entrance exam since I had to quit my former studies  and my job(I supported myself when I left home the first time) and this time I wanted to pursue my dream career. A month ago she told me how it's a waste of money and time and how someone has to be the poor person in the family and not everyone has to go to university (she suggested I work in a factory on minumum wage). 


This isn't the first time she did this to me, it's the 3rd time she vouches to help and bails.
Recently I went in town for a doctor visit and bumped into a co-worker of hers and she complimented me on spending time with ""my brother"" and went on to say that my mom is such a good person to adopt a kid that is basically ""unadoptable"" (my son is mixed race wich is rare on my side of the world), I eventually confronted her about it and she admitted to doing so claiming it was better this way and hopes I'm ok with it. 


I went to talk to some relatives about it and found out she lied about several other things as well,all regarding my son and me(his birth, my health and wellbeing, she told my relatives I begged her to take us in). 


I need advice, I wanna move out, I wanna enrole to uni as far as possible, even a different country and run away with my son.
I made a sort of plan but I'm afraid and anxious and need to hear from others that made it out.
Thanks.

"My boyfriend (20m) made me feel bad about purchasing something I was excited for and now wants me to act ""sweet""


20f here, we've been dating for 2 years and living together for over a year. we were bffs for two years before we started dating. 
tl;dr at bottom of post. 

 I just restocked on make up. All of mine was over 2 years old and since it's getting warmer, I wanted to buy fresh make up since I primarily wear make up in the summer. It was all drug store stuff from Ulta. I spent 100$ and got one of those 80$ free make up bags full of stuff. 100$ in drug store make up can go a looonnng way. I was actually proud at how much I got for the price. The box came in and it felt like Christmas. I was so excited looking at everything and my boyfriend starts to go off about how I waste money and that it's useless. That if I needed to survive, none of this was required and that I just blow through my money. I explain to him that my make up is really old and it's time to get new stuff. He then said that he thinks I don't look attractive with make up and that I just cake it on. That comment really hurt my feelings. To add, I only put make up on my eyes, lips, and I'll use blush and highlight sometimes. so I'm confused on why he said I cake it on.  Since that comment hurt my feelings I just got quiet so I wouldn't start crying (I tear up at literally anything) and kept going though my box. He got mad because I wasn't talking and I looked upset so he went to take a shower. I started crying while he was in there because I felt like shit. I felt stupid buying make up and I wanted to return it all. It also really hurt my feelings when he said I don't look good and I ""cake"" it on. I'm conventionally attractive and I've been doing make up for 7 years, I'm good at it. On top of that I obviously want my boyfriend to find me attractive, so it hurt my feelings that he dislikes something I really enjoy. 

He came out of the shower and is now acting ""normal"" and saying I haven't been sweet to him all day and wanted to know why like......dude are we just going to ignore the conversation we had before you got in? I'm not being sweet because you aren't being sweet either. I didn't say that. I'm just acting like I'm over it because I don't want to start anything because I ""always ruin his good days"". 

What should I do when I love make up but my boyfriend prefers natural? Should I bring up that what he said hurt or just let it go for the sake of not arguing? He's obviously not sorry for it so I don't see the point in trying to bring it back up. 

to add, I have plenty of money. Money isn't even an issue for me. I have over triple the amount he does in his bank so I don't get why he's onto me about wasting my money. I don't want to use old make up. I can afford to buy more, so I did. I really don't understand what went wrong here.

tl;dr : boyfriend is mad that I bought make up. Tells me I'm not attractive with it on. After he made these remarks, he wants me to act sweet towards him. I enjoy make up but he made me feel like I needed to return it. What should I do if I like make up and my boyfriend doesn't? Should I bring it up to him that this really upset me or just let it go?"
"My (28/M) brother (25/M) is dating my crush (28/F) and I'm irrationally torn up about it even though I have no reason to be.


She's one of my friends. We met in uni many years ago, drifted a little in the years after given that I had moved for work, and then grew close again once I moved back last year. I didn't always have a crush on her but I do now and I have for a good five months. The only reason I hadn't acted on it was because she was recently out of a long-term relationship and had specifically said that she wanted to remain single for at least a year when she talked to the group about it. I figured I could just wait it out, and then if I still have feelings for her down the line and we're both single, ask her on a date. 

A few weeks ago two of our friends got married. My brother was invited to the wedding as well and I did notice that he'd asked her to dance at one point. I didn't think much of it at the time. She and I had danced as well. Then towards the end of the night they ended up kissing and going off together. I was shocked by it but I mean ... I guess shit happens. They're casually dating now. If they're happy, then I'm happy for them. I mean that. But I'm also irrationally torn up about it like I said in the title. My brother didn't and doesn't know the truth. Neither does she. Not that I would have stopped him from asking her out. She's not my girlfriend. We never dated. They're their own people. 

I just didn't see this coming. 

There's one other person in the friend group that knows I have feelings for her. No one else knows. It doesn't matter now anyway, but for the sake of my brother, I would rather just brush it off as it'll only create awkwardness if I don't. The thing is that it's hard to avoid them given that my brother lives with me in my apartment. He's in his last year of university and I don't mind helping him out. It's just awkward for me when they're at the apartment. I don't know how to act around her. I can't just avoid them. It's my apartment. And it's not my brother's fault at all, so I would never even think of asking him to move out early. 

I got myself into this situation and I'm not sure how to get myself out. Work keeps me busy but I do try and go on dates if I have the time. Although I haven't met anyone that I click with, I've been trying. Between work and training for a big run next month, I'm pretty busy. Whenever I'm home though, they're around. He asked if he could bring her around first, and I obviously said he could because if I had said no it would have been obvious that I had some sort of weird reason for not wanting her here. They would probably go to her apartment more if she didn't have two roommates who also have their SO's over all the time. In terms of space and privacy it makes the most sense for them to hang out at my apartment. Even though I'm not there a lot of time, it's awkward for me when I am. 

Not sure what to do or how to go about this. It's only been a few weeks but it's getting to be more uncomfortable for me. And I know it's completely irrational and not their problem at all. 

Thoughts? 

**tl;dr** I didn't ask her out because she made it known that she wanted to stay single for at least a year after a bad breakup. Now that my brother, who is in school and living with me at the moment, is dating her and constantly has her over, it's awkward for me. It's not their problem. It's mine. Neither of them know and I don't plan on telling them. I'm trying to get out there and meet someone, but I haven't really clicked with any of the women I've gone out with recently. Not sure how to navigate the situation in a way that won't create drama or awkwardness."
"My (29F) long term BF (29M) changed his mind about marrying me.


First time poster and stuff.

So we've been together as a couple for close to 10 years now. We started dating young ish but this is not our first relationship. We've been with other people before. We've been living together for about 5 years, and will own a house in a few months. No kids, we don't want them and probably never will. My BF is probably the least romantic person on the planet and he's a bit lazy, but he makes me laugh, is patient, generous and is usually willing to try and better himself. He's also a really bad communicator though that has been improving over the years. He still tends to shut down or get mad or will just answer that he doesn't know. However, I believe we still work well as a couple, we love each other and he tells me that he can see us grow old together. A bit more details; the last two years have been very stressful overall. A lot of adult stuff like deaths of close family members, sickness, career changes, stressful jobs, needing to move... Nothing TOO major but still a lot more than what we've been used to.

I've been casually talking about us getting married for about 4 years now. He's always been on the fence about it and maybe leaning more towards not getting married, but can't exactly explain why. He just doesn't feel like the hassle is worth it I think. We work well enough as a couple as is, getting married would just be trouble. He likes it as it is. The problem is, he never really told me 'I'm not ever getting married' and he keeps saying stuff that keeps me hoping he will. I, however, always wanted to have a wedding and be married. Always been clear about that. I feel like it's a very romantic commitment and I feel like I need the legal security that comes with it. However, as time went on and people around us started getting married, I did realize it takes a lot of time, money and can be a pretty frustrating process for the couple and the people in the wedding party. Since then, I've been leaning more towards eloping and then having dinner at a nice restaurant with family and a few friends there afterwards so we can celebrate a bit with them as well. Now, I am definitely being annoying about that. I've been hinting at the subject probably every month since last summer. We've had conversations about it quite a few times in the meantime, with him telling me that he didn't really took the time to think about it and still isn't sure about what he wants to do.  Up until last week, when we spoke about it again. I can't remember how the subject came up but he seemed in a really good mood and we ended up making actual plans on eloping this summer. I was so excited and he seemed to be as well, he was getting a bit emotional and saying stuff like 'yeah ok that feels good!'. We chose a date that is special to us and is about three months away, set up a budget for a ring (low end, not a hit on the monthly budget) and talked a bit about the restaurant where I'd like to make a reservation. I was really happy. Then a few days later, I tried showing him pictures of the restaurants I had in mind because I wanted to make a reservation as quick as possible to make sure we had room for 40 people on a Saturday night. He shut down completely. He wouldn't look. I went away and didn't say much about it. Then a few days after that, I couldn't take it anymore and brought up the subject. I asked him what was up with that, he pretty much said that he didn't know why he asked, that he doesn't want to get married, that I was annoying with this and that it's too stressful to think about that before we move into the new house and before he goes back to school. So now I'm hurt, I have to tell my two best friends that my long term live in boyfriend changed his mind about marrying me a week after making plans to do it, and my whole relationship is on the line because I feel like he was just cruel to me and doesn't care about my comfort in this relationship.

&amp;#x200B;

I realize I probably should have bailed years back when I understood that we did not share the same goals for our relationship, but it didn't seem important at the time since we were on the same page for many other relationships deal breakers and have so many things in common. It was more like a 'I'll deal with it later' problem. But now, it has been keeping me up at night and, honestly, it makes me feel like he doesn't value me like I value him. I just thought that we could compromise between a 'normal' 100-something guests with a venue and a dress and a cake and not getting married at all by eloping and doing something small with our family and friends.

&amp;#x200B;

So, Reddit, what do I do now? Do I keep waiting for him to maybe see my way, do I give up on a wedding and just sign notarized documents to at least have a bit of legal security in our partnership or do I just throw the whole man and an almost decade long otherwise nice relationship away?

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR : I've been waiting for my long term boyfriend ask me to marry him. I feel like I've managed my expectations over the years to compromise since he's not that interested in getting married at all, but he never told me he would not get married ever and always kept me hoping. We had a conversation and ended up planing to elope this summer. We were both excited. A few days later, he changed his mind and doesn't want to do it. He blames stress among other things. I am hurt and I feel like this was very cruel. What do I do?"
"How do I [23M] tell a Christian girl [22F] that I’ll date her but only without a chaperone?


She’s asked me out a few times and the one time I went to her church, per invite, I had to talk mostly to her sister. I know she wants to hangout but if I ask her out I know she’ll have a chaperone, or the responsibility will be on me to find a way to circumvent the need for a chaperone. We’re 22 for crying out loud and I know she doesn’t agree with these restrictions. I just want to get to know her to see if we can date without issues of religious differences. I want a solid understanding and friendship, not a rush into courtship.Alternatively how do I help break free of her oppressive family?

"How do I [30sF] tell my friend I'm too fat to visit her [40sF] home?


She invites me over all the time. And while I'd love to come I don't feel like I can.

I'm around 400lbs and I'm afraid I'll break her furniture. Her and her husband try to live minimally and normally buy their furniture used or from Ikea type places. Having broken an Ikea chair of my own in the past I know they aren't strong enough for my body. And I know I can't afford to repair or replace anything that gets broken. So I make up excuses. Lots of them. And I'm running out and suspecting I need to just tell her. Its so embarrassing, though. I've been trying to lose weight for so long and it'll go great and then I'll screw it all up again. Admitting to people I've still not gotten a handle on it after so long makes it all harder to do.

What do I tell her?

tldr, Too heavy to sit on good friends furniture, don't know how to tell her why I'm always turning down her invitations to come over"
"Breaking up with my F (31) best friend (F32) has been far harder than any romantic split


I have been friends with my (former) best girlfriend for over 15 years and at this point I can no longer say she is my best friend. I admit, I’ve moved around the country (US) but I always made time for her and kept in touch. She’s had a horrific time in life, her dad left us by choice way too early, and her husband hasn’t been mentally stable. I thought I was being a support to her and hearing her troubles. She knows when I thought she was wrong; but I always made sure to let her know I supported her no matter what. 

Recently I moved back to the same city we grew up in and I incorrectly assumed our relationship would pick up where it had left off. We’re at completely different points of life; She’s obviously created a new set of friends through work and time, and I have kids and she wishes she did. Additionally she’s made some life choices including leaving our religion and infidelity. I made it clear that I still loved her and supported her choices to make herself happy, but she chose to let that be a barrier. She kept things from me on multiple occasions assuming I would judge her and it wasn’t the case when it came out; I was just hurt she chose to confide in others and outright lied to me rather than being honest which we always had been in the past. 

Over the last few months I’ve asked her to hang out at least 5 times and she either puts me off or cancels last minute. I feel like an idiot: I wish she would just tell me so I don’t look like some sort of desperate friend. I want to be close to her again and I thought that our history would be a bridge towards strengthening our relationship but I’m the only one trying. Perhaps my honesty and effort put her off and she just wants to start fresh. I really don’t know because she’s pretty much ghosted me. 

I honestly love her as a friend, and that deeply hurts In a way I’ve never felt before. I know her family as my own and am so gutted by her desertion but it’s clear she wants nothing from me anymore so I’ll leave her in peace. Anyone else out there had a friend of the heart move on before they were ready to let go? I guess you may make new friends, but how could you build the same history?

TL;DR female friend of 15+ years throws away friendship and it hurts more than any other romantic relationship that has ended in past"
"M(20) my girlfriend (19)of 4 months overshared


My current girlfriend of 4 months over shared at the beginning of the relationship.


We had been together 4 days at this point and i went to see her on valentines day and she tells me that she’s allergic to cum. I was just like “okay, thanks for telling me”. Then she goes on to tell me that someone came in her eye once and she had to go to the hospital. She also told me that she slept with 15 people when she was pregnant and told me about fucking people in public and in cars. 


She even decided to tell me how big her ex’s dick was.
My question is am I wrong for letting it bother me and why the fuck would you tell someone that when you have only just got together?

Tl;dr girlfriend has overshared and i can help but feel annoyed when i look at her."
"My [22F] alcoholic parents [55F, 51M] ruined my sister’s [22F] graduation and now I want to uninvited them to mine to make a point


TLDR: I want to uninvite my parents from my graduation to teach them a lesson for ruining my sister’s graduation, but my father paid for my education and I don’t know if they’d get the point anyway. What can I do? 

Okay, longer version: 

Yesterday my twin sister graduated Manga Cum Laude from her university. This is a huge accomplishment and she worked so hard to achieve it and I’m really proud of her. The ceremony went well, but throughout the day, my parents drank a lot (as they always do) and by the time we got to the celebratory dinner, they were both trashed. 

The details aren’t important, but my father is a mean drunk and my mother is a wild one, and by the time we ended up back at the hotel, we weren’t speaking to either of them due to what they did during dinner. My sister went to bed very upset and said she was going to tell them they need to drink less in the future. 

Now, I’m considered the eldest sister, so I’ve been dealing with their drinking for years, and I already know nothing will change or stop them. It’s pointless to suggest therapy or rehab or anything of the sort. I know my sister talking to them will only end in tears for her. This morning my sister made a comment to my mother about it and my mom responded “I was good for most of the day!” and my sister got upset, as did I, because I think it’s just so selfish that they can’t try to not drink too much for ONE day, on arguably the most important day of their daughter’s life so far. 

Anyway, the issue. Next week is my graduation (different university) and I want them to know what they did was wrong. What I’d like to do is tell them if they can’t control themselves on the day of the ceremony, I no longer want them to come. 
HOWEVER, the issue is: 1) I am financially dependent on my father for my education. He paid my tuition for this school, so in a way I guess he does deserve to get to go to the graduation, and I definitely can not afford for him to cut me off, as I’m going to graduate school in the fall. The second factor is I know my sister would be upset if they weren’t there. There’s also the possibility they don’t take me seriously, because I have depression/have been in therapy for many years and they always ignore my complaints and dismiss them as “me being too emotional”. 

It’s not that I actually don’t want them there, I just wish they would understand how much they hurt us. I’ve lost count of the number of special, once in a lifetime life events that they’ve ruined or tarnished with their drinking, and they don’t even care or feel bad at ALL!! I just want them to see how upset we are, and I feel like maybe uninviting them to the ceremony would at least make that point. My sister was so upset yesterday and it was such a fucking big day for her. I can’t believe they would do this again. To me, fine, I’m the problematic child anyway and I’m not graduating with honors or anything, so it doesn’t actually matter if they do ruin mine. But this feels like the only way to teach them a lesson for ruining my sister’s. 

It just doesn’t seem fair that they get to continue acting this way with no repercussions. What else can I possibly do to get through to them?"
"Every time I (F,25) talk to my mother (F,49) she shatters my mental health, and I just can't handle it. She keeps wanting to have a ""chat"" about my ""life choices"" and I don't what to do.


 

I don't know how to explain my mother... she's cold, and controlling, and she isn't present- she's always resented me because I am the product of her being kidnapped when she was 23 and she's always told me ""I wanted to abort you"" ""I wish you were dead"" ""I wish you were never born"" ect. She lives a couple states away and she doesn't call unless it's to tell me to do something, or tell me that what I'm doing with my life isn't ""correct"". which is every couple months. And sometimes I wont hear from her at all unless I call, and when I call she's down my throat about everything. I'm never making the proper life choices. and I'm always in pieces and in a horrible mood after I get off the phone/ anytime I see her.

For example, for my birthday she sent me two hardback books with instagram models on the front- the books are all about ""losing weight and having a happy, successful life"". Ouch. I'm 5'8' and 140 pounds, most wouldn't consider me ""fat"". but she thought it would ""aid me in weight loss"".

my boyfriend and I had a really horrible fight a month or so ago, which isn't the norm- and if it were she typically wouldn't be the person I'd call but I NEEDED her- so I called her because I was in a bad way when driving to my friend Brittany's house and she critisized me the entire time we were on the phone about how ""I need to make better life choices"" (as if she really knows about my life choices, she isn't even apart of my life or know anything about me) and she ""doesn't know what to tell me, to get over it and focus on school and getting a REAL job"". and then she told me ""I needed to get my own life that didn't revolve around who I was dating"" which MY LIFE DOESN'T REVOLVE AROUND MY BOYFRIEND, he does his own thing, and I do my own thing a lot of times- I have my own friends, he has his own friends, and we also share friends. But my mother is under the impression that I am incapable of having friends and was just SHOCKED when I told her I have friends (this all spurted from me telling her I was going to my friend brittany's house)

I have a really nice apartment- it's 1000$ a month- it isn't much but it's mine and it's new... I don't have the BEST job but I am happy there and it pays the bills, I am with someone I truly want to spend the rest of my life with and we fight, but hardly ever- it isn't an unhealthy relationship and he is SO GOOD TO ME and supports me always in every life choice I make, I have a dog and a cat- they're like my babies and I wouldn't trade them for the world. My life isn't perfect, it's a work in progress and I am still learning who I am and what I want to do- but it isn't ""wrong"", I don't steal, I don't do drugs, I don't drink and drive, I'm not homeless... she acts like I make the most god awful life choices and am ruining my life. Truth be told, I always did what she expected of me growing up for ""her image"" because ""I was a reflection of her""- so I never got to be myself, EVER. I have horrible identity issues because of that.

she DOES pay for my car, and bought me my car- BUT, she uses that to control me. If it were up to me, I would have bought my own car for 6,000-8,000 dollars- but she claims I need a ""brand new car, because older cars aren't as reliable or good on gas, and they just look bad"". I am thankful, but I really would have rather paid for an older car and had nothing over my head.

Last time she called she was talking to me in the most condescending tone about ""You need to go to college and figure your life out."" ""you need to get a real job"". Here's the thing, I LOVE MY JOB- and it works for now while I'm figuring out what I want to do- I don't know if I want to go back to college- or what I would even go for- but I don't want to go just because my mother is down my throat to go- i want to go because I WANTED TO GO. Because it was my own choice, and I found something I was passionate about enough to make my career. Hell, I've even thought of doing a trade. but she literally doesn't try to know me, or what I like, or who I am. BUT SHE WANTS TO CONTROL MY LIFE and forgets that I'm 25. I don't ASK HER for anything. EVER. But she thinks I am SO LOST. she stresses me out, and is just toxic. She and I are COMPLETELY different people- she's all about ""name brands"" and impressing everybody and caring what people think of her- she has to be just like everybody else.... I am not matierialistic in any way, and wear stuff I find at the thrift store. We just don't understand one another. And I hate that she talks to me like I am stupid, she always has an uninterested or condescending tone. Whenever she comes in town (which is maybe one or two times a year) I honestly don't even ever want to see her. I DO NOT KNOW HOW TO DEAL. I am tired of being whatever she thinks I should be, it is really hurting my mental health and I literally cringe and get such anxiety any time I see a missed call from her, or a text, or an unopened facebook message. i really don't know how to handle this situation.

TDLR; my mother is a total control freak and doesn't call me for months unless she wants to be extremely negative towards me and put me down about my life choices or going to school. She has told me who to be my entire life and now I feel as though I don't have my own identity and I am trying to create my own identity but it still isn't good enough for her. She's extremely negative and stresses me out terribly every time I hear from her to the point where I wish she wouldn't call me or try to come see me. I really don't know how to handle her or stick up for myself, or what to do and need help."
"I (20F) can’t seem to convince him (21M) that sex is not competitive sports.


Been together for 6 months. 

As it says in the title, he thinks of sex as a sport basically — he always needs to outdo himself, last more, make me cum more etc. leading to obvious disappointment on his end. Then he becomes super insecure about it and I have to reassure him endlessly. 

More often than not it’s actually pretty great sex, but still, he can’t give himself a break. He treats it as a competition against himself, he has to do better (in his own opinion) every single time. And it’s really tiring trying to shelter his feelings from himself — I’ve caught myself faking a 3rd orgasm because last time he’d make me cum twice so if I didn’t come three times this time I would have to cheer him up and etc. 

I’ve already told him sex is an intimate moment and not a sport but he doesn’t seem to get it. 

He started having sex a bit later in life than most people so I get that he’s insecure but he’s actually great in bed and I always love the sex, but unless he feels like he absolutely outdid himself he will be sad and I will have to cheer him up and he will say I’m lying to make him feel better and it’s soooo exhausting. What do I do?

TL;DR: boyfriend is extremely insecure about sex, treats it as competition with himself, needs to outdo himself every time. I’m tired of reassuring him right after we just had sex. What to do?"
"I (28F) need a hysterectomy and my mother (49F) doesn't know any boundaries


A bit of background. My mother and I do not have a fantastic relationship. I'll avoid providing names of countries to preserve anonymity, but basically we're both from a second world country. We lived in poverty and didn't have nice things when i was a child. She divorced my dad and married someone from a first world country to find a way out. the man she married was not a nice person and was emotionally abusive, particularly to me. he hated me as a teenager and showed it very clearly. my mum did not stand up for me and always prioratised her new relationship. I understand she was quite young and had her own issues, but the result of all of this means that I grew up to be on guard all the time and quite sensetive to conflict and criticism. I also grew apart from my mother during the critical teen years. 

When i was around 17, her husband divorced her and she started dating a new person, let's call him Jim. Jim was much older than her and a lot more mature. He really understood my mother and also understood that she was quite an unstable person. He put up with it and was a buffer between my mother and I because we fought frequently. We fought about everything, primarily because my mum doesn't know boundaries and she does not accept other peoples choices unless she completely understands every detail of those choices, and then decides for herself that the choice is correct, even if it's not hers to make. this results in a lot of interrogation from her end, and a lot of guild trips, manipulation strategies such as silent treatment etc. it's either her way, or you're the worst person in the world. she also always plays the victim if you give her any pushback, she'll start crying and behaving very childishly. 

About 8 years ago mum and Jim moved to another country. Over the last many years, she has never shared her own personal details with her family. she did not tell her parents that she had divorced and remarried (until my grandparents visited for my own wedding.. they found out about my mother's marriage the day before my wedding). She didn't tell anyone about her heart surgeries and health issues until after the fact. She also didn't tell anyone about the extent of Jim's health. He has had cancer for a couple of decades, the type of cancer that is usually receptive to treatment and you can live with for a long time. Last year he got a lot worse. At one point she said to me that he wasn't feeling well. I didn't think too much because I did not know the extent of it. then two weeks after that I got an email saying that he died. He apparently tried to get in touch with me to say goodbye but was too delirious to call or email me property. Jim and I got quite close over the years because he was a good person and he really helped our family's relationship because he was the only one who could talk some sense into my mum. As soon as i found out that he died, I packed a bag and flew across the world to see mum and help her with arrangements. it was really hard on me and I had to ask for special leave from work. 

that was approx a year ago. it has been a hard year. I grieved a lot. I had to tell Jim's father that he died. this was not nice. I helped my mum scatter the ashes and that was confronting. My mum in the meantime has gone back to her usual self without the buffer. I understand that she also grieves, but she really hurts me in many ways. she calls me fat. She is very racist and calls me a social justice warrior if i protest. She does not respect my accomplishments and doesn't recognise that my education places me in a better position to discuss social inequality issues (I'm an attorney, i have a law degree with honours, and a degree in philosophy and politics. i do pro bono work for refugees as part of my practice). She demeans me in front of others. If i protest, she says I'm young and immature and that my views will change. 

Now to the point. I have a problem with my uterus. I nearly bled to death in childbirth and since then I've had a diagnosed uterine abnormality which means i bleed an incredible amount. the drs put me on high levels of hormone treatment to supress the bleeding, but it has left me with chronic pain. I have gained weight as a result of the high pill dose, and it also causes depression. This week I have seen a chronic pain specialist obgyn who said at this point in my treatment I can have whatever I want. I said I want a hysterecomy because that's the only treatment that will eliminate the issue, and the Dr agreed that it is appropriate and needed in my case.

I told my mother about this because we had been planning to visit my grandparents in our home country at the end of this year. it looks like the surgery will clash with our trip dates, so i told her to warn her not to buy plane tickets yet. that's the only reason i told her. 

She started trying to interrogate me. and I just said no, I do not want to talk about this right now. She called me rude. I said that it's not about how she feels, it's about me and my health and that I'm not ready to discuss this with her. She told me to call her. I said no. a few days later, she asked me to call her again. I said no again. now she's not talking to me, which is fine. 

I just need time to process everything and to get healthy and to prepare my body by decreasing stress, eating healthy etc. I want to give myself the best chance of recovery. I have to make decisions such as keeping my cervix or not. i just don't have the emotional capacity to deal with her right now. I know her well enough to know what she is thinking. She is angry because she wants me to delay the operation because my grandpa really wants to see us. he's getting old and isn't 100% well and wants to see us. my mother also doesn't think that i should have this surgery because she always wanted me to have more children. 

I am the asshole for cutting her out for a while? I'm afraid that she will keep bothering me until I give in. I just want to be left alone in peace and surround myself with positive and supportive people. I understand that she might be worried and annoyed, but i just want privacy. i work full time and have a 6 yo to look after, i don't have time to emotionally manage my mum. I'm also really scared and need support. 

Any advice is appreciated. 

tl;dr: I'm going to have a hysterecomy soon and need love and support. my mother wants to interrogate me about every detail and thinks i should delay it so we can visit my grandparents later in the year. she thinks I'm being rude to her by saying i do not want to discuss it right now but all i want is some space."
"I (33F) just caught my neighbor (30sM) in my backyard in the middle of the night


Tl;dr:  creepy neighbor has been gradually escalating invasive behavior.  Tonight, I caught him in my backyard in the rain.  I don't know what to do to make him stop without pissing him off and risking him doing something worse out of anger.

So I'm a single mom.  A few years ago, I bought a house because it was really close to my son's daycare and other son's school.  I did not realize (and as a first time home buyer didn't consider) that the neighborhood was so rough.  

So last summer, the guy from two doors down started talking to me more.  No big deal at first. Then I came home from a trip and he was mowing my grass.  I was a little uncomfortable with it, but he was adamant that he didn't mind helping me out and if I ever needed anything, I could always ask.  Okay...

I should note that he lives with a woman and their two small children. 

Incidents that have occurred over the past year:

1)  He sent a neighborhood kid over with his phone number.  I threw it away and obviously didn't use it.  A few days later, I'm in my yard with my son and asked me if I was going to call him.  I was like, ""Probably not bro."" He could tell I was weirded out and said he didn't mean any harm.

2)  A few nights later,  I'm in my driveway for some reason at night (getting something out of my car probably) and I just all of a sudden hear this manly voice come out of the dark saying,  ""You really ain't gonna call me?""  This time, I was more annoyed and said, ""Why would I call you?""  He said something about talking and getting to know each other.

3)  Several times he has seen me leaving and made comments about how nice I look.

TONIGHT:

Don't have my kids, went to game night with a friend.   She drops me off and he's in his driveway.   I went aside, changed clothes and then went into my garage to smoke a cigarette.  It is raining, so I've just got the door to the back deck open, standing inside my garage. Tshirt and no pants.  All of a sudden, I see a figure and hear someone say my name.   The motion detector lights come on and it is the neighbor.  In my backyard in the middle of the night in the rain.

I told him he scared me. He was like, ""Oh I just saw your bedroom light on.  Wanted to see if you wanted to smoke or anything.""  I said no, I was good.  He asked me if I still had his number and I lied and said yes (idk why I just wanted him to leave) and he said, ""What is it then?""  Like I would know off the top of my head?  Finally I was like, ""I have no pants on dude.""  And he leaves after telling me to call him if I ever need *anything*.

I honestly feel like I caught him either trying to peek in my windows or even break in.  He did not know I was going to be in the garage.  If he really wanted to kick it or whatever,  why not knock on the door? Or ask when he saw me in the driveway?

I don't know how to handle this without creating a dangerous situation for myself. Real talk, this guy looks like he has probably done some shit.  He's a big guy.  This neighborhood is made up of families who know each other and are right.  I feel like if I'm super direct, I run the risk of pissing him off and then what is he gonna do to retaliate?  If I call the cops, I'm a snitch/fussy uptight lady."
"Our sex life is very infrequent (me 32f, him 31m) and he's given me a laundry list to change.


We've been together 4 years. He's never seemed that into me, but has always said he's attracted to me.

Recently he was talking to another woman online and I freaked out. I suspect they were sexting, but he deleted all their communication. We've fought a lot and he finally agreed that no, I'm not really his usual ""type"" but he loves me and there are things he needs me to change in order to be more appealing to him.

&amp;#x200B;

The list feels long and unfair. But maybe I'm looking at it from the wrong perspective, so I'm hoping strangers can help me know if this is reasonable.

&amp;#x200B;

Part of the issue is that he is not super physically attractive (short, overweight) or fashionable. He's also not my ""type"" on paper, but I've always been very attracted to him. I don't need him to change stupid little things in order to want him.

&amp;#x200B;

He's told me I should maybe change my hair color because he always is more attracted to blondes (I have dark red hair). He has suggested contacts because he isn't really attracted to glasses (yet he wears glasses). He has said he hates my shoes (he prefers heels.....but I cannot wear heels). He prefers dresses (I love jeans). He likes more feminine clothing and says I dress manly (I always have worn button up shirts, jeans, flats). My signature colors are black and white. In fact most of my clothes are black and white. I've tried a few times wearing sundresses. Not only do I feel uncomfortable, I've never gotten any feedback from him. Not sure if he even notices.

&amp;#x200B;

He likes ""long red nails"". Fine, but I work with my hands and I keep my nails on the shorter side, but I'm happy to paint them red. I've always trimmed, but he only likes fully shaved. I find this itchy and uncomfortable, but I've tried a few times (again, not sure he's noticed). I like to do my make-up when we go out. He prefers ""just lash extensions and clear lipgloss"". He has complained about various staples in my wardrobe, so I cut them out (my winter coat, the hats I wear when it's cold, my favorite boots). He has just told me he doesn't really like my perfume (the one I've been wearing since I met him). Now he's also saying he would prefer it if I were about 25 lbs lighter (he has a point on this, but I've always been this weight during the past 4 years). 

&amp;#x200B;

To me, these things seem shallow and like he's trying to change who I am. I'm not a dress-up doll. I've always looked this way, so I can't understand why I now should have to change for him. I asked why he bothered with me in the first place and he says because he fell in love with my personality, but he's finding it hard to be attracted to me.

&amp;#x200B;

He has never asked what I like about him. He doesn't trim/shave/anything. He wears clothing I don't necessarily find ""attractive"" (but nor do I care). I feel so self conscious around him now. But if he's been honest with me about what it takes for him to be attracted to me (and if it will rev up our dead bedroom), should I just accept it and try harder? I'm just afraid it's a slippery slope and soon he'll find new things that he doesn't like about me.

&amp;#x200B;

*tldr: we have a dead(ish) bedroom and my boyfriend is saying it's mostly because he doesn't find me all that attractive and has given me things to change in order to make him more interested. Is this acceptable?*"
"My boyfriend [30M] is cheap with me [26F]


My boyfriend (been together a little over a year) earns 6 times the income that I do, as I'm currently in school, but we still split everything 50/50 - I have no problem with such.

However, in the entirety of our relationship, he's asked me to pick up the bill several times when we've eaten out as he was saving up for an ATV. Trying to be understanding, I happily obliged. I never want to be a financial burden on him and try to help him out whenever I can.

On my birthday, he didn't get me anything, nor did he pick up any of the food bills. In fact, I paid for the pizza we ordered, so technically I paid for his meal on my own birthday. Again, because he told me he was trying to save, I thought I would be empathetic. This also happened again around Christmas time, where he refused to go to any events that I wanted to go to that cost money because he was ""saving up"". When I told him I wanted to go, he told me to ""go with other people. Why do these things always have to be with me."" 

He lived with me for 2 months when he was going to school near me, and I never asked him for any rent in return.

Flash forward to his birthday, I spent $320 on a set of box seat tickets to a hockey game for him, as he'd never been to one. I paid for his parking, food, etc., everything for the night. When I asked him a few months earlier if he'd like those tickets, he encouraged me to get them as he wanted them.

Now, flash forward to a few months later and we ended up taking a trip to an island as a getaway for our anniversary, our first ever vacation that we've ever taken because in his words, he ""can't afford any other vacation because [he's] saving up for an ATV"". Per usual, we split everything 50/50. On the ferry ride back, we were grabbing drinks from the cafeteria, and when we lined up to pay for them, he put his water bottle with mine (as he saw I already had my card out) and told the cashier to ""put it all on her bill"", so I ended up having to pay for it. It was only $3 but the principle of it really bothered me. He brags to all of his friends that he's making $2500 a paycheque, but apparently he can't even pay for his own water bottle?

Most recently, I spent 3 weeks doing his taxes for him (I'm NOT a tax accountant - I actually know nothing about taxes, but I wanted to try and save him some time and money), and got him almost $4000 in return. With this tax return, he put a down payment on the ATV (in addition to all the money he had already saved up for it before), and bragged to all his friends that I got him all that money in return - which led to ALL of them asking me to do their taxes for them. He never once offered to take me out to dinner or to get me anything in return for all the time and stress I went through with his taxes - it was just a simple ""thanks, appreciate it"", and that was it. 

After he got his down payment for his ATV, he phoned me and said ""We need to get you a helmet for this thing. You can pay for half"", and said ""I feel bad making you pay since you don't even own an ATV and you're only getting it because I'm getting one, but oh well"". Half of the helmet cost is $50. He literally could not even spare $50 out of the $4000 tax return that I put in the work to get for him for a god damn helmet for HIS ATV. Inevitably, I finally lost my shit and told him I'm not paying for it, and that I'm tired of this shit. 

All this said, it's important to note that I also have household bills to pay (that are actually higher than his), I have tuition to pay, and my income isn't steady. He knows all of this. I'm relatively good with finance so I know how to budget and where to move money around from so it gets me by. I'm trying to save up for my own place, but that never seems to matter to him - only his own goals do. 

I'm not expecting to be financially supported, nor do I have a problem with spoiling my partner, but I'm starting to feel like all he does is take, take, and take. It's clear that he has no problem with me spending my own money on him, or with spending money on himself - he just never wants to spend money on me. 

What also irks me is that his ex girlfriend lived on the other side of the world and he'd have no problems saving up $1000 to get on a plane to see her, and he'd surprised her several times with flowers, gifts, etc. When questioned about it, he said ""I wasn't saving for anything back then. I am now"". 

I've tried talking to him several times about finances and effort needing to be a bit more even but I feel like all he continues to do is take and take and take. It always turns into an argument where he almost guilt trips me by saying ""well gee, sorry I have financial goals now"", or ""why does everything we do always have to involve money?"". He also busts out the ""I always say thank you - why can't that be enough? It's enough for me whenever I do anything for you."" (And for reference, he doesn't do anything other than drive me around to places that are, 99% of the time, places that he wants to go to, and he tries to charge me for the gas it takes whenever that happens). He also likes to tell me that my presence is all he needs to be happy, but then proceeds to ask me to do a million things for him (ie. mail this letter, do my taxes, lend me some money, I need to stay at your place while I'm at school, I need to use your stuff, etc).

Am I being too demanding here or is he actually pushing it in terms of financial boundaries? Am I asking for too much for just wanting to be spoiled with something as simple as a coffee or a simple flower once every blue moon?

TL;DR: Boyfriend is super stingy with me, never treats me, and is now expecting me to pay for half of a helmet for an ATV that I've had to pick up several of his bills for in order for him to afford."
"I (26m) feel uncomfortable discussing private life at work due to colleague's (28f) opinions


**Tl;dr:** A colleague at new workplace has narrow-minded views when it comes to sexuality. It makes me reluctant to bring up my relationship and in turn, I feel awkward and excluded during these types of conversations.

A little over two months ago, I started working for a small accounting firm. Four people are currently employed on a full-time basis, myself included. Our boss is the relaxed type and the atmosphere is friendly, which I view as a nice change compared to my previous call center job.

My colleagues form quite a tight-knit group and they socialize outside of work, too. Most of them are familiar with details of each other's private lives, which they'll often discuss over breaks. They've made attempts to include me in those conversations and I'd actually like to participate if I wasn't put off by one colleague in particular.

This employee has a very dominant personality, the kind that makes people gravitate toward her even when they disagree. That usually means that other colleagues are easily persuaded to take her side. I'm under the impression she sees herself as ""edgy"" by expressing controversial opinions.

One of these includes believing that bisexuality is a myth, i.e. a phase which you outgrow once you pick your team. Being a bi man myself, I felt incredibly awkward sitting there watching people agree with her as she explained her reasons. Apparently when it comes to men, it's because they can't like both ""receiving and giving"", which got a laugh from my colleagues. Meanwhile I was just looking for an excuse to leave before they could ask me for my input.

I've also noticed she likes to casually equate gay men with feminine stereotypes and lesbians with masculine traits in a joking context. Maybe I'm being overly sensitive, but these sorts of statements make me uncomfortable when the conversation turns to my private life. It's the main reason I've been dodging the topic of relationships. I have a long-term boyfriend (30m) and I'm not certain how my colleagues would react to learning that information. Then again, dancing around this subject makes me feel equally awkward and like something of an outcast during our hangouts.

My apologies if this sounds like a minor issue. I figured I should ask for advice since it's been giving me anxiety.

Do you think I should simply tell my colleagues? I don't think anyone at my office is militantly bigoted. Rather, they seem to talk this way because they believe our whole group to be straight. But that's precisely why I'm worried about their behavior after learning I'm not. Feeling excluded is no fun."
"My (35f) boyfriend (31M) is always late or blows off plans saying its a misunderstanding


Since day 1, my boyfriend has been on another timezone. He's usually late for everything. He lives 5 minutes away from me and he will text ""on my way"", and not show up for an hour+. He will be on time if its something HE is excited for, like a hockey game.

We make plans, with an understanding of what time/where, and sometimes he just completely bails. If we agree on 6pm, he will text around 6 and ask if we still had plans, then around 8 he will get moving. By that time i say forget it, because i'm tired of waiting or have just done my own thing. He's never not shown up, but he waits until last minute and plays like there's some kind of miscommunication about our plans. 

I almost suspect he has ADHD. He doesn't focus on anything for longer than 20 mins, at work he can't seem to organize himself. His house is a mess. His time management is awful, clearly. Probably a bit of selfishness in here too since he's capable when its important to him. I can't function like this and have told him its a dealbreaker and we should think about breaking up as a compatibility issue. He thinks i'm over reacting and being dramatic when he's a 'few minutes late' or not being clear in the plans (?!?!)

Is this break up worthy, or something I can work with? Its been 2 years of this and everything else is good. 

Tl;dr boyfriend always late or half bails on plans, saying he didn't understand the plans or lost track of time. I'm ready to break up over this ongoing issue. He thinks i'm over reacting."
"I (16F) recently dicovered that my Dad (71M) is actually my Grand Uncle and my Biological Dad (40M) is someone I considered my older Cousion.


 So I am a wreck right now and I really  dont know what to do about this. Also ALT account as this situation is  very specific and I dont want people to know.

A few months ago my mum died. She was  always very sick but recently got worse and died. My dad really took it  hard. He was always a very angry and scary dad but mum always calmed him  down and as she is not here anymore, he has been very aggressive  lately. If something is not done very fast, he just blows up and he also  has not been very talkative. He never was much but he just dosent talk  to me lately. Now 4 days ago my Dads older brother (my Uncle), his wife,  their eldest son and his wife visited. My Dad was very uneasy during  their visit. Now the eldest son, the man I considerd my cousin lives in a  different country with his wife and children. They are very well off  people with great lives abroad as far as I know. It was a bit weird to  hear that they decided to visit their home country for the first time  ever as far as I know, due to the death of my mum. This was my first  time meeting him and his wife because as far as I know they never came  back to visit. So during their visit, Aunt and cousins wife were  constantly trying to get me to go on the side, it was a bit uneasy to  see my Dad making excuses for me to not to go anywhere while them asking  me to show them around the house. They did in the end and when we were  alone they started asking me how I was and If I was doing well and such.  At that point I just got emotional and started crying. As this was  going on, I heard my dad getting very angry and shouting. While my Aunt  decided to go and see what was going on, cousins wife stayed with me. So  for an hour we stayed in the room during which cousins wife basically  decided to ask me about my whole history and every few minutues she  would hug me and such. So after an hour we were called back and there my  Dad was just sitting and very angry looking. My cousin spoke first and  said that as me and my Dad lived so far away from the whole family (we  live about a 9 hours drive away from our extended family) and needed  support they wanted us to come and spend a few months in our family home  to relax.

Dad  looked very uncomfortable with the idea but didnt say anything. So  cousin asked his wife to help me pack up and told his mother to help my  dad pack up. I honestly wanted to get away and did not mind this idea.  Being alone with Dad was very uncomfortable. While we were packing up, I  heard Dad started screaming again. He came inside my room and told  cousins wife to get out. Cousin then said something about having an  agreement and that this was my mothers wish and such. I didnt understand  what they were saying fully but I got the basic idea that as my Dad can  be a very weird person at times, there was an agreement which was  agreed upon by my mum regarding me moving away after her  death. They  continued to beg him to cone with them and stay a few days with them  back at the family home which is about 9 hours away where we live. It  took a long time but he agreed. We traveled by air to go the house.  There still Dad was very uncomfortable and was rude to everyone. He  clearly didnt want to be there. After a session of him being rude,  cousins wife took me to another room and was like that I have to tell  you something. She told me that years ago when she and my cousin  married, they had twins in the coming year and they decided to give of  of the babies to my Dad as he and his wife never had any kids of their  own. Implying that I was the kid. She said that they didnt want to give  me away due to my Dad being Autistic and being very emotionaly unstable  but as there was family pressure and that my Mum was there who everyone  loved, they agreed. So cousin is actaully my Biological Dad and his wife  is my Biological Mum and my Aunt is my Grandma with my Mum being my  Grand Aunt and Dad being my Grand Uncle. She wanted me to come with them  to the country they lived in and to complete my studies there meanwhile  they wanted my Dad to live with his older brother or near enough so he  could be taken care of. I just dont know what to say or do here. My Dad  has left the desicion on me. Also really my Dad is a great person and I  really dont want to hurt him but I kinda want to move. I always wanted a  sister and knowing that now I have 2 sisters with a younger brother, I  kind of want to. So what do you all think?

What should I do here?

&amp;#x200B;

TL/DR: Discovered Cousin is my Bio Dad and Bio Mum wants me to go back with them to the country where they live as my Mum has died."
"My (22 M) girlfriend (22 F) is pissed at me for hiding my passwords from her and interprets it as missing trust.


So, my gf of 1,5 years currently has no wifi at home, so she comes around regularily to do some stuff online.

Today, she came around to do some online banking. I know she and her family don't take password security too serious in general, she basically uses one password for everything and she does not make much of an effort to keep it hidden, having it wrote down basically everywhere.

So, she also had to transmit some money to me as I payed something for her, given that she has no wifi.

I should note that I work in IT, so I'm quite the opposite. I got my unique passwords, password managers and everything.

So, for the transaction, I also wanted to login on my phone to grab my account details quickly. I just turn the phone away from her, enter my stuff, but at that point I kinda opened pandoras box already.

She's super pissed, accusing me of not trusting her because I hide my passwords, asking me what kind of secrets I have. I just told her that my passwords are none of her business. Its not because I dont trust her, considering we are both doing great with finance, but that is just my own thing to care about.

The next hour we kinda sit in silence, and even though when she left it was somewhat okay again, but I still feel like she is super pissed.

Did I do something wrong? My passwords are only my business, no matter how much I trust someone, in my opinion. I'm fairly sure I'm not on the wrong page here but I would like to understand her reaction. 

tl;dr: Girlfriend is pissed at me for hiding my passwords from her, accusing me of missing trust. I think my passwords are only my concern."
"Me [42 F] with my Husband [54 M] Married 18 years, guilted me over the pizza I bought; Does it seem manipulative to you?


H asked if I could pick up pizza while I was out today. I said maybe, because his diet has been horrible for a while and he has almost 200 pounds to lose. He’s been off of work for a few days due to his bad knees. He could barely walk a few days ago. But he got some good pain meds, started feeling better and even went out to eat with a friend yesterday. So now he’s mobile. 


I waffled over getting the pizza because his weight is certainly not helping his knee problem and I didn’t want to exacerbate the problem. But I also didn’t feel like cooking. So I got him a frozen pizza. Not Pizza Hut but whatever. I figured I’d get the personal size so at least he wouldn’t be eating a huge 8-slice pie. 


After he ate it I get a text from him saying it was the worst pizza he ever had and he wouldn’t “inconvenience” me anymore by asking me to bring him things from now on. He said something else that was rude. I forget it now and I deleted the messages without responding because I was so annoyed. But it was something implying that I didn’t care about him because I got him frozen pizza. This feels manipulative. But it’s such a dumb minor situation. 


TLDR: H guilted me over pizza. Pizza! I’m wondering if it’s a manipulation."
"My (24F) sister (16) has a ton of issues, and my grandpa wants to send her away to me to ""fix""


Hi reddit,


So, this is a long one. There's a decent amount of back story. Tldr at the bottom. On mobile, throwaway account, blah blah. 


I am the oldest of 5. We share our mom, and there's 3 dads. My mother was a life long criminal with a variety of arrests and convictions. Her first arrest was at 14 for stalking, harassment, and assault. Her most recent arrest for possession and intent to sell narcotics. She died 2 years ago this July from cancer. She lost custody of me at 3.5, and of my siblings when I was 13. The youngest was taken by CPS and adopted before she turned 2. My grandfather, her father, was able to take custody of the others ages 7, 4, and 3. 

My brother (18m) ran away at 15 be with her, and immediately started distributing drugs. He was arrested for possession of an unregistered gun, and has been on probation since then. He lives with his father a ""former"" cartel member, or so he claims. My sister adores our brother. 

My sister used to be an amazing student, athlete, and daughter. After my brother ran away things went downhill pretty quickly. She started getting into fights at hole with our other sister, and then it started happening at school. She swears at my grandpa and his wife. She's failing classes. Stealing clothes and makeup. 


When this first started, I had just had my first child. My husband and I were doing well financially, and had a low cost of living. So, we offered to take her for the summer and go from there. She refused. My grandpa said he'd handle it. A year passes, she tells me she can't handle living there anymore and blames everyone else for her problems. Again, we offer to take her in for the summer and go from there. She refuses, and grandpa says he will handle it. Our mom died that summer. My grandfather brought my sisters to see her before she died, and I insisted that my sister be left with us. My other sister and grandfather thought it was a good idea. However, yet again my sister refused. 

This last summer she finally agreed to spend the summer with us. However, she failed three classes and spent the entire summer in summer school. September of last year her ""step brother"" (child of grandfather's wife) tried to assault her while he was high. I offered again for her to stay with us. Refused. This past February she was assaulted by a boy at her school, and we again offered to take her in for a couple weeks. 

I have pleaded with her and my grandfather so many times to let me help her before something happens where we can't trust her. Or to at least get her counseling. She's been through a lot and needs proper help. They both refuse. 

I get a call from him today that she has been stealing 100s in clothes and makeup from my other sister and his wife. She stole a credit card and rang up 500+ dollars that he can see so far in ubers and uber eats because she won't take the bus, and she won't eat lunch at school. My grandpa has had enough and says he booked a ticket for her to spend the ENTIRE summer here, and then he texted me about some sort of packet he mailed to us about custody papers. We are not in a great place financially right now, and I know this last thing will be a deal breaker for my husband. 

I want to help my sister, but we live in a different state, our finances are no longer stable, and honestly I'm worried about the influence she would have on our daughter. I wish he would have let me help three years ago. 


Tldr: My grandfather has refused to get my sister professional help, or to let me help her for years. Now that's she is stealing from him, and getting into weekly fights at school he wants to send her away to us. We can no longer afford to take her on, and I'm not sure what to do."
"My (24M) newphew (5 months) was born with with no hand. My mother (60F) said she doesn't understand how my sister (29F) can be a model and have an ugly baby. My dad and I could use some help fixing the relationship


My sister was a model at one point in time. A very successful one at that. She had posed for numerous magazines and runways. She made a lot of money off of it and started her own company that has really taken off the ground. She's a very successful women, and my mom has always been very proud of her. 

She had a baby back in December that was born with no hand or it had to be amputated for some reason. My mother being her and never knowing when to keep her mouth shut. Decided it was a good idea say she doesn't understand how the ba by was born with no hand and that he looks ugly because of it. You can only imagine how well my sister and her husband took that comment. There was a massive fight and they haven't spoken since.

My mom claims she was just speaking her mind that the baby didn't look as cute as it would have with 2 hands, and that she didn't mean anything negative by it. My dad has been asking me to help him repair the relationship and I don't know how. They've always been close, but mom really pissed off my sister with that one.

**TL;DR: Mother basically said that a baby from a model should be born perfect and he was ugly because he had one hand. Dad wants me to help end the tention in the family and I don't know how**"
"My (21M) boyfriend (20M) has gotten obsessed with our size difference.


**TLDR: BF started new gym routine to get buff, and now can't stop making vaguely cannibalistic comments about my small size.**


I, at a very modest 5'6, am significantly shorter than my boyfriend (of 2 years), who is towering over me at a much more impressive 6'3. As a guy, I'm not happy about it, but what can you do?

My boyfriend and I are both also rather slim, although a slim 6'3 still weighs quite a bit more than my ""petite"" frame. That too, I have come to terms with. I have a lot of hobbies and interests, and going to the gym to bulk up doesn't appeal to me at all.

My boyfriend, though, has started working out as of late. I don't really comprehend it, but gaining a new interest is always great so I'm happy. He hasn't been going long or hard enough to see any real change, but he's certainly changed attitude wise.

Namely, he's become rather obsessed with my size. 

Not in a negative way, really: Not in a calorie-monitoring, ""Should you be eating that?"" kind of way. 

He simply can't stop commenting on how *small* my frame is and how *significant* our size difference is. And possibly will be, if he gets all buff like he wants to be.

He does things like suddenly picking me up without warning, feeling my arms and legs: The worst part is when he squeezes my waist and says something like ""You're so tiny! **I could crush you!**"" or ""If I hug you as tight as I want to **I might snap you in half!**"" 

It's sort of like he's hinting that he's going to murder me. 

Of course, I told him that this bothered me (and also jokingly mentioned that it made him sound like a serial killer), which he did not like at all. He argued that it should make me feel safe, and that it was really hurtful of me to act like he's being creepy or threatening. He says he likes how small I am because that means he can protect me.

Now, it's not like people don't normally comment about my size: When you're a guy who is 5'6, everyone does. And it sure isn't the creepiest comments I've gotten about my size (not by far). But I just feel disrespected by his comments, like he's treating me as a little kid or a girl. And also, yeah, really creeped out. He almost never mentioned our height difference before, so I don't get why 1 month at the gym changed him this much."
"Coworker 33F won't leave me alone 29M


 A woman I work with 33f has made it clear that she's interested in me. I 29M have told her several times I only see her has a friend. I'm not attracted to her at all in any romantic way. Over the past few months she has not left me alone. 2 days into working their she found me on Facebook with 0 mutuals despite never giving her my last name and my name is pretty hard to spell and uncommon so you won't find it unless you search for it with the correct spelling. She messaged me on Facebook 3-6 times a day despite me giving short or no replies. At one point she tried to invite me over to have drinks and bang. I told her no I only see her as a friend. She got salty and the next day at work threw some things at me. Management saw this and ignored it. She left me alone for a bit. Then started back up again over the last couple of weeks and it's escalated in the past week. She corners me in hallways and tries to talk me even if I give the hint I'm not interested in talking or on my way to the bathroom or outside to smoke. She has messaged me on messenger at work saying she's sad she's moved desks because she wan't watch me anymore. Twice over the past week she has invited me to lunch I told her I packed my lunch still tries to get me to go with her. I tell her no. Storms off saying ""fine"". Tried to get me to go out with her to a bar the other night and I told her no thanks I have plans and she got upset and salty over that one was well. Has several times poked me or messed with my jacket hoodie. She doesn't seem to get the hint I'm not interested in her. I've tried to tell her I'm not interested and she needs to chill out but doesn't seem to get it. Not sure what to do.

"I [F27] don't know if I'm capable of raising my boyfriend's [M29] baby [M5mos]. We didn't know he existed before last week.


 TL;DR: My bf just found out about a baby that might be his. The baby's mother has unfortunately passed away meaning that my bf would be raising him. I don't know if I should stay.

&amp;#x200B;

Hello Reddit,

&amp;#x200B;

Per usual, this is a throwaway, and I'll be editing details to keep myself as anonymous as possible. I lurk on /r/relationships quite a bit, so I'm hoping to get some insight on this situation. I feel overwhelmed and desperately need advice because I can't talk to anyone about this in real life yet. 

&amp;#x200B;

To the issue itself. My boyfriend (M29) and I (F27) have been dating for 8 months. My boyfriend, who I'll call James, sat me down on Saturday and told me that he recently learned he might have a 5 month old son with a one night stand from before we were together. He's pretty sure the baby is his. He hasn't had contact with the baby's mother since they hooked up. This isn't a question of infidelity, as the dates line up with what I know and what he's told me. And I believe him when he says he didn't know about this baby. The reason he just found out is because the baby's mother (I'll call her Amy) passed away suddenly last week, and Amy's sister contacted James. He's already reached out to a lawyer to figure out what the next steps are (establishing paternity, etc.), and he's flying out tomorrow to meet Amy's sister and what might be his son. If the baby is his, he plans on raising him. For him it's no question he needs to take full custody.

&amp;#x200B;

Where I fit in all of this, I fully support James with whatever decision he makes. However, obviously this is a huge decision that impacts our relationship if I decide to stay. Before this point, we've discussed marriage, and know that it's something we want in the next year and a half. But as far as children, we're both undecided. We are both well off financially, and the nature of my job means that it would be easiest for me to become the primary caretaker of this baby. I have a lot of mixed feeling about this. On the one hand, we had previously discussed that if I were to accidentally become pregnant, we would keep the child. Although definitely not the same, this feels similar in the sense that this is so unexpected. But on the other hand, I don't know how I feel about raising another woman's child. I don't know if I'd be capable of giving this little baby the care and affection that he needs. And I need to be sure because it wouldn't be fair to either this baby or James.

&amp;#x200B;

James is giving me as much time as I need to decide what I want to do. We love each other and want this relationship to continue. But now it's so much more complicated, because I wouldn't just be committing to him, I'd also have to commit to raising a baby with him.

&amp;#x200B;

Like I said, I am so overwhelmed. James already suggested we see a counselor after we get the results of the paternity test. Would individual counseling be warranted in this case as well? And also I want to make sure that I can be a strong supportive partner for James right now. I don't know what to do."
"My ex [24m] had problems with ""emotional consent"" and didn't take our breakup well. We have a 10 person course together starting next week. How do I [24f] handle this?


My ex and I dated for 6 months, and we broke up in November 2018. So we've been broken up for about as long as we were together. I broke up with him because, among other things, he monopolized my time and didn't give me any space whatsoever. We are on the same ""track"" of the same grad program, so we inevitably take most of our classes together. That's how we met, and we have a year until we graduate.

Long story short, he didn't take our breakup well. He would call/text me incessantly (until I blocked him), and he would come by my work (I work at the front desk of an office on campus) and talk to me for 30+ minutes while I was on my shift. We went ""no contact"" via phone/social media for about 6 weeks, but I eventually unblocked him because we have a lot of friends in common and it felt easier to just let it go at the time. He then resumed texting me about once or twice a week (normally under the guise of school-related questions). He would also Snapchat me multiple times a day, but I never responded.

A couple weeks ago, I realized just how much he was still Snapchatting me even though I hadn't responded at all. I decided to just go ahead and block him because I didn't want to see his name keep popping up on my phone (every time it did, I got annoyed). Great decision on my part! I'm not sure whether he's noticed that I've blocked him, but he hasn't Snapchatted or texted me since.

There would be no problem here, except for the fact that he and I are taking the same seminar this summer. It's a 10 person practicum-type class, so we will be together in class 3 hours a week and then in the office for another 20 hours a week. I don't intend on unblocking him, but I would just like advice on how to handle being around him that often. I was hoping that by now he would be over the relationship and we could be normal work colleagues, but I don't really see that happening. How do I keep things professional between us? Should I talk to him before the course starts and tell him what boundaries I'm putting up? 

Throughout our relationship, there was never any outright abuse, but there were certainly red flags and manipulation. He also has issues with what I call ""emotional consent."" Like, how he would continue to contact me even after I told him to stop. I don't want to open the door to that behavior again, but I also don't want it to build up and cause issues throughout this course. 

Any advice is much appreciated!

TL;DR: My ex has had a hard time leaving me alone after our breakup. I've tried cutting him out of my life as much as possible, but we have a small class together starting next week. How do I handle him?"
"My 26f new boyfriend 28m just told me his friends all think his ex is better looking


My new boyfriend of about a month just rang me after a night out he had with his friends. He told me his friends all said his ex was better looking but I’m nicer. This really hurt my feelings. I don’t expect to be the best looking but knowing they all said this made me feel ugly and embarrassed.

Now I’m sitting at home upset and I don’t know what to do. I’ve got a lot of insecurities around how I look and I don’t cope well with hearing negative things about my appearance as I got bullied a lot as a kid. I wish he hadn’t told me. I don’t feel good enough now. I don’t know what to do or say.

TL;DR: boyfriend told me his friends were discussing his exes and they all agreed his last girlfriend was better looking than me. Now I don’t know what to say and I’m hurt."
"I [27M] was 'gaslighted' hard by my best friend [28M] for years and cut him out of my life years ago. But he still keeps coming after me.


**tl;dr:** My best friend for years did a lot of things behind my back and slowly made me feel insane. He would tell me how crazy I sounded and get me to question my memory continuously. It wasn't really on my radar that people did this kind of thing. I ignored it for years as I couldn't prove much of it or as the root cause was hard to discern. One day I pieced it all together and cut him out of my life - it was tough as he was embedded so deeply everywhere. That was years ago but he still is trying to interfere in my life. How do I stop him from keep coming back?

**Examples:**

* My wallet went missing constantly for years. He kept saying how forgetful I was and bringing it up to many people. Yeahs later I still have people I've not known long make fun of me for it, which is weird. I realise in hindsight it went missing when he was there and didn't go missing when he wasn't. It was always so stressful losing it and I cancelled so many cards and replaced so many drivers licenses. 

* At a festival my wallet (with £300) was stolen out of my tent while I slept, I now realise. He persuaded me I left it in a toilet and that he saw me leaving without it. I thought I hadn't but believed him as I was drunk at the time and he was so certain. He somehow persuaded me to queue up at lost property for 2 hours a day every day for 4 days and refused to lend money. Some people really gave me a hard time for losing it and asked how I could be so stupid. It really was stressful. He persuaded everyone how forgetful and clumsy I was and not to lend me money. I was lucky one person who I hardly knew did lend me £100 so I could eat. I later found out a few people (in my friendship group but not friends) had gone into my tent to 'watch me sleep' the night it went missing as he persuaded them to. On the very last day of the festival it was in lost property.

* In our university yearbook he had the yearbook editors (close friends of his) create a new category called 'most forgetful', and I was placed at number 1. I had been member/leader of countless clubs, societies, won international competitions representing our university, yet those things were written out of history and this shit gets to be how people remember me.

* We all go to a nightclub (that doubles as a bowling alley) and my shoes and coat go missing. He persuades me to keep checking new places throughout the club over the course of hours. He kept saying ""are you SURE you didn't place it at X'. He really fucks with my memory. He gets me to check lost property. I am about to walk home without a coat in barefoot at 2am in winter and he gets me to check lost property again. I already had checked 5 minutes prior but he insisted. And it was there. I asked who handed it in and they described someone just like him. I asked him if he handed it in and he flatly said no. This was the only time I provably caught him for this and it was what made me question all the times I 'lost' stuff before.

I only pieced everything together after the last event. But there were a few times, at key points in my life, where he went all out to put me down a worse path. I created distance with him after each. But now I think distance isn't enough.

**Examples:**

* I was getting serious with a girlfriend and she suddenly broke up with me. Immediately before my ex-girlfriend broke up with me my friend and his girlfriend got her alone at a party and spoke to her. I don't know what they said and they denied any recollection of talking to her about anything important. My girlfriend said to me minutes after they talked to her that they said something terrible. But she didn't say what. She told me 'they are NOT your friends'. She said 'is [the girl] in love with you?' and I said 'i dont know, maybe' and she said 'well lets just say thats why they said all that'. But my girlfriend was very cold with me from that moment until she broke up with me a few days afterwards. She didn't give a proper reason when breaking up, she just threw hundreds of little things at me, some true some not. They only were able to talk to her as one of them bumped into her on the street on the day of the party and invited her to the party. They don't live or work near each other so it was a crazy coincidence. I already did not introduce girlfriends to my friends at that point because I sensed the pattern of relationships souring as soon as they met them. If they bumped into her sooner in the week I would have made other plans with the girlfriend for that evening. I reached out to her to ask her what they said but she has no interest in talking to me at all. 

* He also, with another guy, made a private facebook album and photoshopped me in dozens of images stalking girls at our university. The girls were all tagged and I was not so the album was invisible to me. People really did start acting different around me at that time and I had no idea why. The friend told me it was all in my head and that I sounded ridiculous. I only even found out because by chance 1 of the 30 girls told me later assuming I already knew. I made me wonder how many other times something like this happened and nobody told me.

* He once threatened me that if I took a hedge fund job I was interviewing for that all of our mutual friends would stop return my calls. I had just lost my previous job 3 days before and he invited himself around my home with his girlfriend to offer me this ultimatum. I said 'I just left my job and you are doing this?' and they replied 'you didn't leave your job, you were fired' in disgust, which still makes no sense to me as a response. I told them to leave my home and they refused and said I was being pathetic and that they were helping me and I was being pathetic. I didn't take that hedge fund job only as I didn't get the offer. A large number of our mutual friends did start to completely treat me like shit but nobody ever told me why. 

I became very depressed when I realised I was going to lose all our mutual friends when I cut him out of my life, as I knew his play book and had already been cut out of one group. I did lose 80% of our mutual friends. None have said why they no longer would invite me to anything or reply to my messages. I mourned this loss of dozens of great friendships and have slowly moved on.

I had to leave the city, move back in with my parents, and keep my life as private as possible. I had major depression for a few reasons, not directly tied to all this, but now when I look back I see this as an important contributor at the root of so much. I've had 5 different kinds of therapists and many different medications and I exercise and eat very well. I have a nice remote job that pays well and I like the work. I started to think about moving out again and getting a potential wife and so on. I thought I was starting to move on.

**Recently:**

* 2 weeks ago he texted a girl he believed I was dating (we aren't, but we had a romantic history and suddenly started hanging out a lot since I've reconnected with old friends after losing so many others and we are near each other). I don't know how he even got her phone number but he said he needed to talk to her about me and he was really concerned about my mental health and it was urgent. I have not talked to him in years, I have him blocked on all social media, I live hours from him. Also, we have a few mutual friends I still see monthly he could have talked to, yet none of them have received such messages from him. Also I have other home friends he knows far better that he could have messaged. It is clear why he wanted to meet and talk to her. She came to me first as she knew most of my problems with him.

He will never stop or admit to anything, I believe he will keep doing this, maybe for decades. He isn't getting bored. I cant fit everything this guy has into this post, this is only 30%. In addition to the 'forgetfulness' angle he pushed hard, for years the 'pervert/creep' angle behind my back in countless ways. Before I figured out a lot of this I started to have severe anxiety in relationships because people I built feelings for would suddenly go cold and ghost me. I used to have zero issues but for a period of years I had to excuse myself to vomit before or during sex 90% of the time. This has stopped since I realised the root cause. 

The very worst things he did I cant even write here as they are too complex. I already sound crazy enough.

**How do I force him to stop?** I just want to have a nice job, life, relationships, someday a family. I am scared of working hard to build something when it seems so effortless for him to take it away. So many partners/ close friends/ acquaintances suddenly treat me completely differently, without anything between me and them happening. I was in a public place in [huge city] 3 weeks ago and a friend of his walked up to me and started to patronisingly insult me for living with my parents. He once told me he wasn't OK with me wanting a family because of Overpopulation, and I believe he might use that moral argument to 'intervene' if I started one.

I don't want to spend any more energy on this, or go to war, or go through long civil court cases with weak evidence. My female friend offered to be a 'spy' with a tape recorder -  which was really kind of her. I cant update my linkedin in case he reaches out to my employer so its fucking up my career. I cant let any girlfriend meet or bump into any one of my friends in case their name becomes known to others and he finds them. I had to quit all social media, yet I cant stop people taking group pictures with me in them and uploading them. 

Please, I am at wits end. I cant see the police/restraining-order angle working as he is seriously smart and operates from afar, always with plausible deniability and usually through a third party who rarely sees themselves as being manipulated. Most of the things he has done I likely don't even know about. All I have is correlations and a few facts. Most of the time he persuades people that his ideas were their own idea - I know because he did it to me. He persuades people of things individually, one-on-one, then starts telling others that other people believe it, attributing the idea to them, and he can craft a fake truth out of nowhere without anyone realising its origins. 

I don't want to write all the above. I feel so stupid for not stopping it all sooner. I did create distance but he always found a way back by surprise and would be extremely kind and fun and charming and invite me to great stuff. Initially I vowed to never live with him again, then to never introduce girlfriends to him or reveal their names,  then to never sleep in his presence, then to never introduce girlfriends to any friends at all, then to never go on nights out at all where he might be, then to never reveal any information about where I was or what I did to anyone who knew someone who knew someone who knew him...

**TL;DR: How can I live a life without hiding, when an old friend is extremely malicious and cruel, motivated to destroy whatever I build, using complex and manipulative practices, always maintaining plausible deniability?**"
"I [30sF] refused to go with my SO [30sM] to see his mom on Mother's Day. It didn't go well. Now I feel like I may be in the wrong?


Nearly every time I set a boundary with my SO, I feel terrible, like everything is my fault, and that I need to do anything to make the discomfort go away. Today we had a fight and I told him I didn't want to go with him to see his parents this afternoon. I feel like I'm justified in this, but I also feel terrible now for not going, so I would appreciate other perspectives.

&amp;#x200B;

Just this morning, SO woke up in a bad mood. Fine -- nothing out of the ordinary bad-mood wise. Our plans were to go to the dog groomer, buy some groceries, pick up dog, go home so we could watch a soccer game, then drive to his parents' house for Mother's Day. We get moving, dog in car, about to arrive at groomer, and he stops at Target and asks me to run into get him a Starbucks. I was reluctant because, well, I didn't want to, and it was raining, and it was 3 minutes before our grooming appointment, but I went in to get him a coffee. It was closed. Came back out told him. He was not happy and drove aggressively to vent his anger on the drive over to the grooming place. I asked him to stop driving like that because it was scary. No response. Continues aggressive driving.

&amp;#x200B;

Cue to arrival at groomer. Before we had left, I looked for our dog's vet paperwork before we left but couldn't find it; I thought him having his rabies tag would be enough, especially since we've had grooming done there before. When we got to the groomer, they wouldn't accept our dog because I didn't have the actual paperwork. I was super frustrated because we have older paperwork on file with the groomer--but rules are rules so I just left and brought our dog back to the car where SO was waiting. I said I wouldn't be scheduling there again and I slammed the car door. Yep, I was being a baby. I regret slamming the door. Once I explained the situation, SO berated me for not having the paperwork saved digitally in my email, which he claimed he'd told me to do a long time ago. I told him I didn't have it, that I looked for it that morning, and that I was sorry but I didn't have a digital copy. We drop dog off at home and then go to store. He drives aggressively again. Terrible awkward silence the whole time.

&amp;#x200B;

Well, I'm upset now. I felt blamed for the paperwork issue, but I was really upset about the driving. So once he parked, I got out of the car and walked to the door of the store quickly (it was raining) to just sort of get away from him for a minute and calm down. Not the best choice, I guess, because once we got into the store, he escalated things hard. He took the cart and started walking down the aisles just throwing things into it, very visibly pissed. I tried to steer clear of him and very gingerly put things into the cart here and there. He went to floral and picked out a bouquet for his mom and brought it to where I was at the cart. Then, he stepped away to go get eggs. I looked at the flowers and they were all wilted and brown, so when he came back, I told him that he may want to get a different bouquet because those flowers were not in good shape. He then told me, very loudly, that he didn't want to hear my fucking opinion and then muttered under his breath something about me being a bitch.

&amp;#x200B;

At that point, I gave him our credit card and asked him for the car key. I told him I didn't want to be in the store with him when he was acting like that and that I would wait for him in the car. He could finish the shopping. He reluctantly gave me the key, and I left the store and went to the car and cried. I sat in the driver's seat so I could drive us home. When he comes out, he slams the grocery cart into the car and pounds on the back of the car for me to press the trunk release button. He loads the groceries, again really pissily. As we are pulling out of the parking lot, I stop to let another car back up in front of me, and SO asks me if we are just going to sit here ""all fucking day"" and wait on this person--why aren't we going. I told him that this was why I'm driving because I didn't want him to be aggressive and scary. He mimicked it all back to me in a derisive way and made fun of me for being upset.

&amp;#x200B;

When we got home, we retreated to separate rooms for a little while to cool off and for him to watch his game. I texted his mom and told her that I wasn't feeling well and that I wouldn't be coming to their house today. I also made a list for him to give to his mom (she had asked for some addresses from me and I told her I would bring them when I saw her). In our entire relationship, this is the first time I've ever not gone with him to see his parents when he goes.

&amp;#x200B;

I work on other things on my computer for a while. At half-time, he came in to the room where I was sitting to apologize. I should've made it clear, I guess, that I accepted the apology, but I just jumped to telling him that I wasn't going to go with him today and that I wanted space. He moved from ""apologetic"" to pissed again really quickly and got angry and blame-y with me for not graciously accepting his apology. He watched the rest of the game and then left, but not before he took the note I wrote up for his mom, which I placed next to his keys, and ripped it into tiny pieces and threw it on the floor.

&amp;#x200B;

I sent him a message telling him I thought what he did was immature. And I tried to explain that I felt it was within my rights to not go with him to see his family. He basically responded with more passive-aggressive punishing texts, like ""Don't talk to me this week,"" ""I won't be going with you now to ""x"" event that we discussed attending together earlier"" ... He told me that if he tried to ""pull this shit"" I'd ""demand"" that he attend (by the way, he sees my family once per year, max, and I've never demanded anything). He also told me that this week ""You're on your own, going to events. Take Note."" I tried to call him to talk about it 2-3 times but he just declined the calls. I asked him over text to talk to me but he just said not to call him again.

&amp;#x200B;

Now, after this whole ordeal, I'm the one who just feels bad about myself, and I'm ruminating on my missteps. I feel like I was within my rights to not spend time with him today after he cursed at me in public and humiliated me like that. And, after he refused to stop driving aggressively. Am I wrong? I thought I was setting a boundary and sticking up for myself but now I feel like the ""bad guy"" who refused to go spend time with his parents. I just saw them two weeks, ago, by the way, by myself. I went (while I was off work staying at home BY MYSELF and SO was on his buddy's bachelor-party trip) to see his mom and dad because she really wanted me to come. It's a 3 hour round trip. I went because she'd just had surgery two weeks prior and I didn't want to hurt her feelings.

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR: We had a fight where SO embarrassed me and cursed at me in public. I told him I wanted space and did not want to go with him to see his mom today for Mother's Day. Was I being unreasonable?"
"Is it inappropriate if I (f/28) show my condolence to my boss (m/28)?


My manager lost his grandma this week and he was in a pretty crap mood today. We just work in retail, but I really wanted to say something to make him feel better. This sounds so pathetic, but I went and bought a gift card to a grocery store that he told me one time that he gets lunch there sometimes.  


I wrote “I’m sorry for your loss. Hope things feel back to normal soon. Enjoy a lunch or two on me” 


But I chickened out and didn’t give it to him. I’ve only been there 4 months, but he’s a really cool manager. 
I felt awkward to hand it to him because someone else was around and I’m not sure how that looks or the etiquette on giving a manager a gift. 


Then I was going to leave it on his desk, but someone was around it and I felt awkward then too. 


I’ve never been good with showing sympathy, so I’m not sure what’s right or wrong. If he wouldn’t even want to be reminded or others to know. He didn’t tell me directly so that’s why I felt so awkward about it. 


I just wanted to cheer him up, but I feel like an idiot lol. 


Should I still give it to him or is it inappropriate?


TL;DR My manager’s grandma passed away and he seemed in a bad mood at work. He even stayed home from work yesterday. I wanted to cheer him up with a gift card to a place he told me awhile ago he gets lunch at sometimes, but I felt too awkward. Should I still give it to him?"
"My (35f) fiance (32f) is insisting on a lavish, expensive, over-the-top wedding. I hate hate hate weddings, especially lavish, expensive, over-the-top weddings.


(Throwaway because this is kind of personal to me)

My girlfriend of 16 years and I are getting married. We've known for a long time that we'll be together for life. She started talking about marriage 4 years ago when our union became legal, and it really freaked me out. I hate weddings. I hate legalizing documents of love. I hate the idea of building a family and raising babies and buying a big dumb house. And yet, realizing that I had been close-minded, I finally proposed to her in April. 

She immediately started drawing up wedding plans. She wants to get married on the beach. I'd rather do it at a courthouse, or maybe at my parents' synagogue. She wants to invite all her family, all my family, all of our mutual and separate friends and many of her coworkers. I'd be happy inviting my dogs, our parents and my best friend. She wants to get a full seafood buffet catered. I want to have a grill and a couple brewskis after the ceremony. She wants a honeymoon in Majorca. I want to spend our newlywed days at the local Mariott. 

I'm sure you're starting to get the point. We're opposites. Usually, this works in our favor. Not this time though.

The thing is, I'd love to compromise with her. I'd be ok with an expensive cake. I might even wear a white dress for her. But she is insisting on these crazy elaborate plans. We have enough money for it, but it would mean we'd have to spend the next couple years living frugally. I like my current lifestyle, and I'm not going to change it just so I can have one giant stressful party.

I love her, I really do, and I'm still gonna go through with the wedding. But I just can't manage to convince her to ease up on her expensive plans. I know I can be painfully stubborn at times, but this lady is on a whole new level of pig-headedness.

TL;DR - My fiance wants a fancy expensive wedding. I want to get married in a courthouse. We're both at extreme ends of the spectrum when it comes to stuff like this. It's almost impossible to compromise."
"Cousin/ Best friend [26/M] is staying with me as he is on the outs with his GF [25/F] after she slapped him. I [26/M] am actually on her side and want him to apologize. He will not listen to reason.


  

My cousin Miles and I grew up together, he’s my best friend and though we’ve grown apart the last few years, I’d always be there for him. During high school, a few things happened that indelibly changed Miles and he kind of went down a dark path. He rebounded but was never the same afterwards. A couple of years ago, probably 5 years now, he met “Susanne” who has been his long-suffering girlfriend. They are dramatic and have broken up at least a dozen times over the last 5 years. Usually every couple of months there is some sort of problem and at least every 6 months they “take a break.” 

Miles has become a perpetual fuck-up. He can get fired on his second day of work; he perpetually says the wrong thing, acts in a manner contrary to good sense and will invariably infuriate his girlfriend. He’s the kind of guy who forgets to buy heating oil; he can’t cook and is absolutely unable to get shit done. He’s unreliable and his judgement is always off. Despite that, he’s got a heart of gold and absolutely has a huge amount of love to give. The number of times I’ve had to get involved and save him from self-destruction is innumerable. I personally think the drugs messed up his brain in such a way that he’s become child-like in his inability to fend for himself in so many situations. Susanne effectively looks after him and now they’re having a baby. 

She’s 3 months pregnant and caught him flirting with another girl that lives nearby. The girl tried to kiss Miles who didn’t exactly pull away and he did this not realizing Susanne was standing there. Miles is yet again out of work, doesn’t have prospects right now and was at home while Susanne was working. When she arrived home and realized he wasn’t around, she went looking. She came upon the two of them getting too close for comfort. Susanne was furious and as best I can tell from both their accounts (her I trust more, sadly), they returned home and they got into a huge fight. He called her s(#t. She turned to walk away, he tried to grab her to say something and she struggled to get away and when he persisted and wouldn’t let her go, she walloped him. I am absolutely not condoning violence, but if she’s struggling to get away from you, there’s a chance you’re going to get hit. 

He stormed out and left. He’s staying at various places and has come by my apartment on more than a few occasions. I live in the city and he hates driving/visiting the city, so the frequency of his visits lets me know he’s really conflicted about this. He thinks the problem is all on the girls – the first girl for kissing him and Susanne for slapping him. He often won’t see his own culpability. I’m busy in grad school (fulfilling a lifelong dream, finally) and yet I still managed to jockey the phone to broker peace. My aunt blames herself for the way Miles turned out (which I would say is probably true as she fucked things up royally) and will never, ever, be straightforward with him. She’ll also never tell him when he has done wrong. His mom validates everything. So, it means she will say the problem is all on Susanne when in reality, he’s such a tool that he brought a lot of this drama on himself. 

I’m getting fed up. I’m constantly busy with school work, I’m fed up with Miles’ drama and I’m getting to the point where I can’t be his sage. I am racking my brains trying to find a way to get through to him. I’m appealing to all of you: What should I do in this situation? Am I wrong? Am I the crazy one?

&amp;#x200B;

tl;dr Cousin engaged in a lot of drugs and wound-up kind of frying his brain. He got into an altercation with his long suffering GF and tried to keep her from walking away. She slapped when after he tried to restrain her and now he wants an apology from her. I'm tired of being in the middle and not sure if I've handled the situation correctly,"
"I (26F)made a pros and cons list about my bf(28M) because I’m desperate for clarity. (Together 3 years.) Is it salvageable?


Personally, I know that when you’re to the point of making pros and cons lists, the relationship is probably over, but I need to write this out somewhere and get some clarity. I desperately want to salvage it because he’s the love of my life and he has all the potential in the world.

Some Pros: 
•Puts others before himself. He’ll give someone his last dollar no matter if it sets him back. I like how he isn’t materialistic.

•Loyal, I’ve never seen him check out another girl in three years. I trust him 100% and have never felt tempted to look through his phone.

•Amazing lover. He’s incredibly giving in bed and makes me orgasm every time. Also attentive, slow foreplay, including long massages with oil. Zero complaints in the physical aspect of our relationship.

•Can be very thoughtful. He gives me gifts that make me tear up. He takes my shoes off after a long day. He buys me unexpected snacks, and has written me love letters.

•He makes me feel beautiful and gives me compliments often. 

•He is great with kids and says he desperately wants kids with me one day. We seem to have similar views on parenting and are both fairly strict. When we’ve babysat his little cousins in our apartment, he always asks them to thank me and be respectful of my things. 

•He’s the best looking man I’ve ever seen 🤦‍♀️he charms everyone he meets and I’m very attracted to him, even his smell drives me crazy. People say he’s very charismatic.

•He’s supported me through rough times. I don’t want to get into detail but he’ll definitely hold me while I cry kinda thing.

•Potential, He’s highly intelligent, funny, can do comedic impressions, musically gifted, athletic, great cook, handy around house, etc. 

•I absolutely love his mother and she treats my like her daughter. I get along with his family and friends even though we have very different backgrounds.

•He doesn’t have anger issues, he communicates very calmly. He’s good at reading my emotions. He trusts me and gives me space and encourages me in my hobbies and career. 

• I have a lot of respect for him. He’s been through a lot. Based on his childhood, he should have ended up in jail or a drug dealer. I cut him a lot of slack because he has a tough life and his parents never taught him about money or a lot of life skills. Considering his life, he’s done very well for himself.. however...

Cons: 
•Will not seek treatment for mental health issues. I think 80% of his problems would disappear if he would get help. Sometimes after a fight, he’ll agree to go but he never does. I feel like I’m living with Jekyll and Hyde sometimes. He’ll be very happy and goofy one day, and like a robot the next. Or cranky if he doesn’t smoke. He also doesn’t take care of himself when he’s depressed and doesn’t consistently brush his teeth, shower daily, eat healthy(or eat period.) He refuses to go to the dentist or doctor for checkups either, likely due to money(even though I’ve offered to pay or make appointments) which leads me to...

•He’s bad with money. He doesn’t pay on his loans. He eats out every day unless I buy the groceries and pack his lunch. He doesn’t blow money on “stuff” for himself, but between weed, eating out, and helping other people out, it disappears quickly. His mom still helps him some, and I’ve lended him money before.

•He doesn’t want to get married or have kids until he’s financially stable(valid) but I think that day may never come. I want to start a family before 30 ideally.(actually earlier would be ideal, but I’m not rich either. I’d like to have a house and more savings first.) 

•He has had 4 jobs in three years, which I don’t mind(I don’t want him to be unhappy somewhere,) but he usually leaves on a negative note. He’s usually right about a lot of things, but sometimes I think he should pick his battles and not have such a problem with authority. He is a very hard worker though, and gets promotions easily. 

So basically I think he has the potential to be a great husband and dad but I think his stubbornness is preventing that. Is there any way to get him to go to the doctor or get better with money? Ultimately, he has to make the change but I wish there was something I could do. I don’t like ultimatums, but I think I’d rather do that than just break it off without giving him a real chance to get it together. I don’t need perfection, or a big house, or someone rich. I just want him to be able to pay his bills and be happy. Even if therapy and meds didn’t help him, I would probably stick by him, sad and all, but him not even trying bothers me. Every time I start thinking about breaking up, his depression subsides and he’s happy and wonderful again. If he was a grump all the time it would be easier to end things, but when things are good, they’re unbelievably good. I just want more consistency and stability. Help 😢

TL;DR: My boyfriend won’t get help for depression or money issues. Any way to wake him up?"
"My boyfriend [29M] acted really rude towards his mother [??sF]. I [24F] want to say something but not sure how to approach the topic.


So yesterday me and my boyfriend took his mother to a restaurant for mother's day (she has to work today). 

His mother's always adored me, and I never understood why. We have/had a huge language barrier for almost the entire time I've been with her son. She's lived here for nearly 25 years now, but always relied on her son or her husband to translate for her, so she never learned how to speak English, and understood very little when people spoke it to her. However at the end of February, though, his father left his mother. And in that like, two and a half months or so, she's learned a *lot*. Like, I was actually able to have a real conversation with her! 

Anyways, she seemed to be pretty confident in herself (more than I had ever seen) and when the waitress came around to take our orders, she was starting to tell her what she wanted when my boyfriend cut her off and ordered for his mom. Like it wasn't even like he just ordered for her, but she was speaking just fine and he cut her off. And she just looked so defeated. I just felt really bad for her because she was doing so well and seemed so confident but my boyfriend took that away really quick by interrupting her, like he didn't think she'd be able to do it on her own, and that confidence seemed to just disappear. Like, there really was no need for him to cut her off as she was doing great. 

My boyfriend's really protective over his mom, and has given me crap before calling me rude for being a bit uncomfortable when I was alone with her in the past (with the language barrier). I feel like he'd be really defensive if I stepped in and told him he was being a jerk to his own mother. 

TL;DR: Boyfriend cut off his mom who's been working hard to learn English and seems to have made her lose a fair bit of well-deserved confidence. I want to stand up for her but I am not sure how to approach the topic with my boyfriend."
"My (60F) Mom allowed me (32F) to be abused as a child at daycare and won’t acknowledge any of it. I’m considering ending our relationship.


It’s sort of a long story spanning over 8 years or so, but I’ll try to keep this as short as possible.

My mom has always been an incredibly hard worker. During most of my childhood she worked two different jobs as an RN. So I was often in the care of someone else. I can remember about as far back as 5 years old when we (my two brother and I) first started going to a new daycare in a new town, we will call the daycare lady “Shelly”. At first things seemed pretty awesome. Shelly would French braid my hair every day and offered popsicles freely. She would play barbies with me, and I soaked it all up as my mom was so absent that I had never really had a relationship like that with a grown woman. Shortly after starting daycare my mom and her new husband found out they were pregnant with my third brother. I was 6 when he was born. For some reason her pregnancy seems significant in the drastic change Shelly took on, but I’m not sure it has anything to do with it. I did notice right away how she treated the other children, but I thought she did it because they were bad kids. A normal day would be her pulling them around by their ears and forcing them to stand in a corner for hours at a time. When Shelly turned on me it wouldn’t take much to piss her off. One time I took my socks off and didn’t put them in my backpack, so she grabbed me by my hair and drug me across the floor to the corner where I stood there until my mom came to pick us up. One time I was eating a piece of watermelon and spit the seeds out onto the driveway. She forced me to stand in my bathing suit while she sprayed me with freezing cold water from a high pressure hose. Not too long after this incident we were removed from the daycare. I spoke to many professionals after this, they all questioned me about what had happened there and according to my aunt the daycare was shut down and Shelly spent some time in jail for child abuse.

My oldest brother was old enough to start watching us after we left Shelly’s. Things were pretty normal for about a year until he got too busy with after school stuff and sports. So we started going to a new daycare. We will call this lady “Wanda”. She didn’t even try to play nice with us. She was cold and mean from the very beginning. I enjoyed going to school because it was 7 hours a day I didn’t have to spend at Wanda’s. Summers were the worse, Wanda would make us spend the entire summer (no matter how hot) outside with no water until our parents came to collect us. She would stay inside watching her soaps all day while stuffing her face and if we needed to use the bathroom we would have to knock on the front door and wait until a commercial break. If we got in trouble we would have to sit on her front steps with no shade for a few days at a time so we could “think about what we did wrong”. Winters were rough too, as it meant we were inside more to make her angry and punishments would be severe. We had the same thing for lunch nearly every day (a very small bowl of rice mixed with cream of chicken soup, I’m talking maybe a cup), sometimes just plain macaroni. The only time I ever had anything other than the rice or some other bland mushy food was when I was recovering from tonsil removal surgery when I was 8 and she forced me to eat crunchy foods despite me crying and telling her how much it hurt my throat. One time I got so upset I threw the food up (there was blood in it), which resulted in an extended spanking (she spanked us often and left marks). If Wanda caught you in a lie she would make you stick your tongue out and then smack the bottom of your chin so you would bite your own tongue. I remember one little boy bleeding a ton and it just pissed her off more. I had precocious puberty and started my period when I was 9ish, she told me I couldn’t take my purse to school which left me in a really embarrassing situation. My baby brother would cry while my mom was walking us into her home and spent a good deal crying throughout the day. I was always very hungry and thirsty. I begged my mom to send us somewhere else but her excuse was that this babysitter was cheap and she couldn’t afford anything better.

I never got to have the childhood I should have had. I spent most of it in fear, and doing whatever I could to not upset Wanda. The summer vacation other children looked forward to felt like impending doom to me. I resent my mom for not being my advocate and allowing this to happen to me. I don’t seem to have the ability to form healthy relationships because of this. I ended up in an emotionally abusive relationship with a man for 8 years and couldn’t even see what was happening until one night he got physically violent and the police were called, I left and never looked back. We have been broken up for a few years now, and I am of the mindset that I won’t ever be able to have a healthy relationship with anyone, ever.

I have brought up Shelly and Wanda now as an adult to my Mom and she tells me that it wasn’t like what I remember at all. Sometimes she will do a nervous giggle and change the subject. I quit trying to bring this up to her, she clearly has no plan to tell me why or even apologize. Lately this has really been weighing on me. I’ve been in therapy for two years now and my therapist seems to think my eating disorder (anorexia) stems from the abuse I received as a child. My therapist is awesome and she’s the only person I truly trust. She wants me to focus on the forgiveness aspect of it all, and try to move on so I don’t have all these barriers around me. I just can’t.

I’m beginning to think I need to just cut my mom out of my life. Sometimes I’m so filled with anger I can’t even look at her. When I’m around my mom all of those memories come flooding back and I want to scream at her for not doing something. I can’t help but feel that if she apologized I would come to some sort of peace with it all and just move on with my life.

This hasn’t completely stunted me. I have a successful career, and I’m still continuing my education. I consider myself friendly and kind and even make “friends”with others but there is always this feeling that I shouldn’t let anyone in. If anyone gets too close I’ll start to ghost. I hate that I am this way, but I’m afraid of what it will mean if another person hurts me.

Reddit, where the hell do I even begin in terms of healing myself and maybe having a future relationship with my mother? Am I a garbage human for just cutting her out of my life after all these years have passed? My brothers remember these things too but they don’t seem to be as effected by them. Am I over reacting? I need help.

Thank you for taking the time to read this, any advice or suggestions is appreciated.

TLDR; My Mom knew I was being abused as a child and did nothing to stop it. I’m thinking about cutting her out of my life in hopes it might help me move on and heal."
"Broke up with my high school sweetheart over 7 years ago, and I (27f) still think about him (29m).


Gawd, I made this account just to get this off my chest in hopes that somehow, someway he will find his way to this post. WARNING: long as fuck.

We were in high school when we first got together; I was a sophomore (15yo), and he was a senior (17yo). We had so many ups and PLENTY of downs throughout our relationship, but overall I remember it being great.

He really was my best friend then, and probably is still one of the funniest people I have ever met in my life. My sense of humor exists because of him; my sense of humor IS very him, or at least who he was. I am a foodie because of him, as he had shown me the fun in loving goodies. Spontaneous adventures is how I love to spend my free time, no matter how simple, and I feel like it’s because we went everywhere and did everything we possibly could whether it was walking or driving. We always had fun, and I loved it. He always did little things to show he cared for me; he made sure I was always fed, comfortable physically mentally and emotionally, made sure I was always having a good time, and taught me how to do things by thoroughly explaining why each step was important (mainly video games like Tekken, SF, Maplestory lmao BUT STILL). He embedded in me that in a relationship, we take care each other. I was in the middle of growing up during our relationship, and he shaped all the enjoyable parts of me. Of all the “best” friends I have ever had even now, he was the only one who I can say saved me. My father was abusing me, and he found a way to share his home with me so that I spend as much time away from the abuse, but he saved me in so many more ways.

As time went on, I became such a shitty girlfriend - the typical psychotic girl who always got her way through manipulation. I lied a lot, cheated, treated him like garbage.. he still loved me though. There’s a lot of reasons why I may have been the way I was, but I reflect often and can only make sure I never treat anyone that way ever again... I even got pregnant with him, and he wanted to keep the baby, but I was so young at the time I chose abortion, and it’s one of the memories I had buried away and nearly forgotten. He was hurt by my decision. Eventually I pushed him away so hard that by the time I wanted to be right for him, he began giving up on me. He began to cheat and lie as well, completely disconnected from me not just emotionally but in general. I would go days not speaking to him because he wouldn’t get back to me, weeks not seeing him because he was no longer interested in making time for me.

When I reached 20, he told me something that hurt me so bad, it was the last time I ever spoke to him and was the absolute end of whatever was left of us. I felt my world spiraling down. Like I literally saw everything and everyone spinning around me as if I was in the middle of a cyclone. Everything was going so fast yet so slow at the same time, it was silent and I was drowning in pain. He tried to get in contact so many times after, at least once a month for a year, and I ignored him because I felt so betrayed and destroyed. His messages slowed down to eventually nothing. And I feel like shit to this day because it was selfish of me to be so upset with him. I should have heard him out and instead I chose to shut him out. I really do feel I deserved the pain he gave me because it was never as bad as the pain I gave him. I owed it to him at least as a friend, and I was the one who abandoned him, it was always me. 

For those who actually read this far and hate me, don’t worry. My karma came ten fold and is still going.

Fast forward two years later, he emails me saying that he still misses me. BUT I don’t see this fucking email until two years AFTER he sends it. It’s crazy as fuck because when he sent that email, it’s right before I begin dating my now husband.

When I read the email, I cried. When I think of everything, I cry. As I type this, I cry. I replied back only saying I hoped he was doing well but of course nothing back. I still check every now and then hoping he would just tell me he is. I still think about him almost every day. Not so much in the “I wish I was with him instead” way, but in the “I wonder where he is” “I hope he’s doing okay” “I hope he forgives me” kind of way. I definitely still wondered what life would be like if I ended up with him, but you know...

Anyway.
This is the only social media I have now, and back when I had Facebook and Instagram, I was never able to track him. It would bring me peace to know he is doing good and is happy, I also hope he knows deep down inside I love him dearly and always will. But I don’t think that’ll ever happen. 

TL;DR I still think about my high school sweetheart after 7 years."
"Boyfriend [39m] has grooming and social issues that I [40f] am having trouble with


My boyfriend and I have been together for about 11 years. We've had longstanding issues because he comes from a troubled past (long story). He is an extremely special and wonderful person, so I've stuck with it. He has improved his life greatly since we've been together, but intimacy issues persist. We only have sex maybe every 2-4 weeks, and it's due to me having issues with intimacy. I want to get over these issues, but one of the obstacles I'm running into is that about 2 years ago, while he was working an extremely stressful job, which contributed to his PTSD, he started having an issue with grooming.

He will spend hours in the bathroom cutting his own hair, and often ends up with a very close shave on the top, and long in the back. He also shaves his eyebrows off. I can't help but feel like he is looking ugly with these cuts. He also cuts his pubic hair very short, which I'm not into (seems boyish). I love him, but it's become increasingly difficult to feel attracted to him when he looks this way. If I'm honest, the shaved off eyebrows make him look very weird and almost mentally ill/scary. When I've asked him about it, he says it's because they're always growing in unevenly. It's the same issue with his hair, he says he's trying to save money by cutting his own hair, but then goes too far because he keeps trying to make it even. We both know he has issues with anxiety due to his troubled past and PTSD, so both of us have known that the excessive grooming is not completely harmless, but he generally speaks about it like it is.

I'll admit, I've been complaining about it. I'm definitely trying to be sensitive, but my frustration is surely coming through. Over the past several months, I can tell he's tried to avoid shaving his eyebrows completely off, maybe because I've complained. He must have a setting on his razor guard to leave some hair. They've typically been lightly there, but it's been years since I've seen them in full. It looks less weird when they're lightly there, so I haven't complained in several months. He's also been better about not going nuts on his haircut, and has been going to the barber to let a professional take care of it more often, although usually when he goes to the barber, he comes home extremely upset because they cut his hair in a way he doesn't like. Usually after he gets back from the barber, he'll shut himself in the bathroom and spend a while ""fixing"" it. A couple of months ago, he finally found a barber he liked, and came home from the cut feeling great, and saying that he finally found someone he can trust, and will go back to them, but I don't think he has.

His general mental issues and outlook have really been getting to me lately. He has been increasingly talking about how all people are terrible and he wants to avoid them. He gets angry while driving and can't accommodate other people doing normal things, i.e. if they are stopped in a parking lot waiting for a parking space to open up, if someone hesitates while making a left turn, or if someone opens their driver side door to get out of their car when they are parallel parked as he is driving by (even if it wasn't an unsafe distance from our car). He finds all these to be extremely inconsiderate and contributes to his total disdain of all people, and he gets angry about them. Driving with him is stressful, and we bicker about it, because I am never on his side when he says people are doing these terrible things, I think they are normal. This is really bothering me, I would like to have a healthy relationship with society, and have a social life, and this is making me depressed. The driving stuff is just an example, he gets upset by what people do in pretty much all situations where he has to deal with the public.

So onto my present situation, 3 days ago, he was fired from his job due to a poor decision he made. 2 days ago, he shaved his eyebrows completely off and gave himself a very close cut on the top of his head, leaving it long in the back. It's been a while since he's shaved his hair and eyebrows this closely.

Last night, I decided to google ""compulsive shaving"" because I noticed the correlation to the stressful event. I found a blog post written by a person who has a disorder called trichotemnomania (not to be confused with trichtillomania, which is more well known and involves hair pulling). I really wanted to talk to him about it. Many of the comments mention it being related to stress and anxiety, and the need to make their hair ""even"", which seems exactly what he's been doing.

This morning, he mentioned to me that the hair on the back of his neck is a mess (he keeps it longish in the back, but likes to keep his neck groomed) and he needs to take care of it. I said it doesn't look that bad, and took the opportunity to bring up what I found on the web page. I said I'm not angry with him or anything, but I think his compulsive shaving is unhealthy and he might have this disorder. I mentioned that it seems like he's shaving because he feels he needs to, not because he likes the ""no eyebrows"" look or the haircut he's giving himself. I was trying to be kind, and kissed him on the head while I was saying these things. He said it's up to him what he feels like he should do with his hair, and besides, he thinks there is an added benefit to the weird look of no eyebrows because it keeps people away from him. This information really upset me, it seems like he's trying to scare people to keep them away, and got a bit teared up and said I don't want to be in a relationship with someone who's like that, it's not a happy life. I also said honestly it's keeping me away a bit too, which he shouldn't be surprised by because it's the effect he has been wanting to have on people.

Me saying these 2 things really upset him, and he decided to be mean and point out the hairs on my chin which I'm not great at keeping up with plucking. He said it looks like I am growing a goatee (trust me, it's not that bad, there are like 10 hairs total), which he said jokingly to me once last year and it \*really\* hurt my feelings, and we had an extended argument about it. He knew that was going to hurt me.

I have been shut in my office for a couple hours avoiding him after that argument. A few minutes ago, he came in and tried to ask me if I needed to keep a receipt, since he was cleaning up. I wasn't totally down to act like nothing happened, and I said, you were trying to hurt my feelings on purpose, and I was specifically trying not to hurt your feelings. He said ""well, you failed"". I said well, at least I tried, and I don't find it acceptable that you intentionally tried to hurt my feelings.

I don't know what to do, I'm pretty miserable, I want my boyfriend who I love to stop going down the path of hating everyone and making himself ugly. I'm also not down with him hurting my feelings because he's hurt, something he's done many times over the years, which I find to be immature. I have considered leaving, but I love him and making things work would be strongly preferred rather than breaking up. Please keep in mind that this post is (of course) only about bad things, in general, he is extremely loving and appreciative toward me. I'm also worried because he's had a history of feeling suicidal (the last time he talked to me about it was about 8 months ago). It would not be a light decision if we split up, we've been living together for many years, and our lives are quite intertwined. It would be more like a divorce.

I'm sure I will get replies suggesting that he needs to go to therapy, but I literally have zero idea how to convince him to do that, he has been in therapy before and did not benefit from or enjoy it, so is generally not open to it. Would love ideas on how to change his mind on that.

Thanks to those who read all this. For those who didn't -

TLDR; I \[40f\] want to work on intimacy issues with long term (11 years) very loving boyfriend \[39m\], but he has been shaving his eyebrows off and cutting his hair in generally unattractive ways, which I think is due to an anxiety disorder. He also increasingly hates the general public and told me that he appreciates the way his grooming makes him look weird because it has an added bonus side effect of keeping people away. When I told him this desire of his upsets me, and he's also keeping me away, he intentionally hurt my feelings about a completely less serious / different type of grooming issue I have (he has a habit of hurting my feelings when I hurt his). I'm miserable and don't know what to do to get him to go to therapy or otherwise help this situation."
"My twin (20F) wants me to swap boyfriends with her for a date to see if they can tell the difference. I said no and she just won't let it go.


My boyfriend (20M) and I (20F)have been together for a year. My sister (20F) and her boyfriend (21M) have been together for 8 months. 

My sister has this idea she just won't let go. She wants me to swap boyfriends for a date and see if they can tell the difference for a YouTube video. I've said no a million times. She just keeps fucking asking me. I've told her that isn't fair on the guys for them to be tricked into taking a girl out that isn't who they think it is. She says she thinks the guys wouldn't be pissed off about it. James and Brandon would probably figure it out pretty quickly as well. James (my bf) can tell us apart pretty easily. I've told her it's just not normal to want to do this. She just won't shut the fuck up about it 

**TL;DR: Sister wants to swap boyfriends for an funny video to see if they can tell us apart.**"
"My (21 M) girlfriend (20 F) is angry at the minimal texting when hanging out with my friends.


Hello everybody, I’ve gotten to a point where I’m just at a loss for what to do and I would really appreciate some input. There’s more issues, but this is the most recent and major issue that we cannot seem to get around.

I’m a full time student at my college and I go to class six days a week. Most days are technical field classes, which has me out in the mountains without service for the entire day until I get back home around 5. Naturally, I can’t text her at all when that happens, so I try to reserve the rest of the day texting and talking to her. However, I sometimes have a lot of writing assignments, so we’ve both set up a system where I let her know I’m busy, and that I won’t be able to text her during that time. I’m not a great multitasker, so it can be hard for me to write and talk at the same time without losing my concentration. 

She lives about an hour from me in a satellite town, which is fine, as we both drive an hour to most places each day. Of course, with me being a full time student going at it six days a week, that really only leaves one day that we can hang out, which is normally an all day affair. That’s really the way it’s been for about a year of us dating. However, sometimes she cannot hang because she wants to be with her friend or she has some family function the same day that we normally hang. Perfectly okay in my book, so I usually take this opportunity to hang out with my friends as well, as I can really only either hang with her or my friends each week. 

So this week was a little more special, as my buddies cousins were coming over, so he laid a out a big event for them. I also hadn’t seen my some of my friends in nearly a year. She had a birthday party to attend the same day and time, so I was able to make it. I texted her that I was going to be busy and wouldn’t be able to text, to which she said okay and asked what I was doing. I replied, and she said, “Nice!” 

Well, the night expires and I head home, and I get a slurry of messages telling me that I do not put her first over my friends and that it’s horribly rude to not text her at all while I’m pretty much doing “nothing.” I tried to explain the situation, but it spiraled our of control to a point where we both dug our trenches. 

Today, we had a phone conversation that wasn’t pleasant, and I figured the best solution was a compromise. Well, she didn’t agree with that either and we’re both in pretty frustrated moods. 

She claims that I put my friends ahead of her, but it’s really the opposite. I go months on end without being with them, rarely texting them, and trying to give my undivided attention to her. She always gets frustrated at me if I ask to hang with my friends, but I’m always happy to accommodate for her, so I can really only do it when she’s busy. I just feel all I do is give her attention, so I just don’t know why she thinks that way. I can’t really even be alone and practice hobbies unless she’s busy doing something else as well, but that’s beside the point.

This probably sounds very minor, but it’s been a very big thing these last couple days, and I just feel so depressed and stressed. It seems to crop up every time I hang with them. I just don’t even know what to do. I’m probably in the wrong here, but I’d appreciate some help if anyone is willing to share some advice or input. Thank you.

TLDR; Girlfriend gets mad at me when I let her know I can’t text her on the rare occasions I hang with friends, leading to a major fight. I rarely text or hang with them because I usually reserve all my rare free time for her."
"My dad’s [38M] wife [43F] got touchy with me while I was in my room and I don’t know if I should let my dad and my girlfriend know


TL;DR - My dad’s wife came into my room in the morning while I was asleep and touched, I don’t know if it’s the right thing to tell my dad and my girlfriend

I want to start saying by I am sorry if my writing is hard to understand, I’m not very good with English since it’s my second language

My [17M] dad [38M] got remarried with his wife [43F] who he had been dating for 2 years after my mom passed away. She’s been nice to me; she has tried treating me nice, buying me stuff, but she has also tried replacing my mom’s place.

Here’s what happened as I remember it. Last week on Saturday I was asleep in my room around 7 in the morning. I didn’t notice but she came in my room and shut the door behind her. 

Well she started touching me all over and she even touched my private area. I also felt her kiss me on the cheek and I woke up startled because  my girlfriend was not over at my house so I didn’t know who was touching me. 

There was my dad’s wife and I asked her what was going on. She said she just came to wake me up, but when they wake me up they just knock on the door or call my phone. 

I feel really guilty and have no clue what to do. Like I think my dad deserves to know, but I don’t want to ruin everything or I also don’t want him to think I’m lying. I am also not sure about telling my girlfriend because she’s a jealous person and I don’t want her to break up with me."
"Grandma 90 is trying to use me 25F as a flying monkey against family, anything advise on how to solve this


So this is a long one, and I’m on my phone. So apologies for formatting issues.

To start my grandma my mums mum has always been demanding, and a little obsessive on small things but we dealt with it, she is 90 and living by herself and she liked it that way, we visited her whenever possible. 

About 6 months ago, she was wanting to have a French drain installed (I am not a plumber/drain layer cannot give more details) she was quoted 5K by a drain layer, my sisters (late 20s) partner and plumber offered to do it for as a favour. Job done, sister went and checked the following weekend she was happy with the drain and again a month later no issues. After sometime she started saying it was all wrong and she was unhappy with it and wanted them to pay for someone else to fix it. 

During this my parents50/60s became concerned about her mental health etc and asked her GP to check her for thing like dementia or anything else as she was alienating her neighbours and friends. The GP told her all of this and it escalated to my grandma kicking my parents out while they were checking on her. My grandma then got a trespass notice on my Mum, she is angry and not talking to my dad for talking her side and angry at my sister and her partner.

The issue is now I’m the only one she will talk to and recently she started offering me her stuff (typical grandma things fine China, crystal, heirloom things) after checking I was talking to her still.  She has also made me her emergency contact(which is fine, except I’m planning on moving overseas next year). Now tonight she has asked me to deliver a letter to my sisters partner, and not tell sister/parents. I feel like she is trying to buy my affection and attention and turn me into a flying monkey. I know this isn’t as dire as many issues, but I’m struggling figuring out how to deal with this. I am not sure if being transparent with my sister/parents is the right move on what my grandma is doing is the right move or just not passing things on.

TLDR:grandma is not talking to family members and is offering me things and then asking me to pass on messages to people not sure what to do"
