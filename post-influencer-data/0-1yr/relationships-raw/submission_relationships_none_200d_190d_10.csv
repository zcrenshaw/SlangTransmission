0,"I (29f) caught my fiance (27m) red handed reaching out to women on tinder, but he doesn't know yet. How do I confront him?


So for background, my fiance and I have been together for about 2 years. I am currently pregnant with his child. Besides the fact that he's been a little over protective with his phone, there haven't been any other indications that our relationship isnt working out for him. Tl;dr at the bottom.

So yesterday a friend of mine came across my fiance's tinder profile. She called me and then sent me screenshots. At first, I was torn. I had heard that tinder profiles can stay up if you don't actually deactivate them, so I did some googling. I found out that tinder buries inactive accounts, and that if its popping up in an area with alot of users, its probably still active. I know him though, and if i just confronted him about the profiles existance, I'm sure he would come up with some excuse as to why it was there. So I made the questionable decision to make a fake account with pics stolen from the facebook of a friend of a friend.  I started swiping and his account showed up almost immediately. I liked it and closed my phone for the night. I was hoping I would never hear from him. 

Well this morning I did. He started by telling me how beautiful (fake) me was. Then we talked about his hobbies and finally he told me he wanted to meet. He said he was looking for something ""real that will last"" and that he has a habit of ""picking liars and losers. "" 

I am so torn. One side of me wants to just walk away. With no real indicators in our relationship that he is out here doing this, how could I trust that he's stopped. Or even how long this has been going on. But I am about to have his kid. We talk often about having more. I love him and I love being with him. I also feel guilty for even creating this profile and having these conversations. I feel like I set him up. How can I approach him about this? I don't want this to turn into some hostile screaming match. We still live together. I want him to stop this but that isnt up to me. 

Tl;dr: I caught my fiance in tinder with a fake profile. We have been talking all day. How do I approach him and let him know that it was me and I know what he's been doing?

1,"My boyfriend (28m) wants me (22f) to take down an ""embarrassing"" and ""ugly"" Instagram picture that got very popular



My boyfriend is really into Instagram, he is a personal trainer / life coach and he gets a lot of clients through social media, plus some brand deals. We have each other's pages linked in our bio's, as boyfriend and girlfriend, but I'm not as intense about IG as he is. He occasionally asks me to post something, I guess me being on there is a part of his image, and I just post something I have queued up. I just post nature and workout related stuff occasionally. I generally don't post pictures of my face or body, it's just not the type of photography I enjoy. I like taking pictures of the woods, animals, or other people, better. This will be important later on.

I do krav maga, and sometimes the gym owner will take candid pictures of the classes for the gym's social media pages. I noticed after looking through them that I have a tendancy to make funny faces when I'm totally in the zone. Especially if I'm gasping for breath or grimacing from getting hit, or trying really hard to focus on something and kinda screwing my face up. 

I thought that was funny, I didn't feel all that self conscious about it. I know I've got a pretty expressive face in general so it wasn't too surprising. And I thought it would be funny to crop close around my face in each picture and make a collage of my funny faces for my Instagram. They weren't cute or attractive at all, but I thought they might make my friends laugh.
 
I posted it on Instagram with the caption ""Krav Maga Checklist... Gym clothes. Water bottle. Gloves. WAR FACE 😠😠😠."" And a couple hashtags... It turned out to be my most liked post ever, by far. It went way beyond entertaining my friends, a lot of new people followed me. It went kind of viral.

I'd not given it too much thought, but then my boyfriend texted me to ask what the fuck I'd posted the day before. I was like ""uhh just the funny faces I've been caught making at the gym"" He asked me to take it down, it was embarrassing and ugly and it was affecting his ""brand"" which I found ridiculous, I don't figure anyone cares about his brand enough to insta stalk his girlfriend, and find one silly picture collage, and judge him on that. He got really irritated that I thought nobody would. 

I asked why the picture was that embarrassing anyway, loads of people liked it and probably thought it was funny. He said it was ugly and embarrassing and just weird that I'd collect the worst possible pictures of myself, and put them out for the world to see. I was just like ""hey that's just what my face looks like sometimes, I'm not gonna be embarrassed of my own damn face"" 

So... I still have the picture up, my boyfriend is still not a fan of that. I feel a little crappy that he thinks it's embarrassing. And I don't know how to explain that to him because I don't really even know why it bothers me so much. Does he have a point that my post would somehow hurt his brand? Should I get over myself and not feel so weird about this disagreement?

tldr ; boyfriend told me to take down an ""embarrassing"" IG picture and I feel weird about it

2,"Update: My sister [27F] just let me [25F] know that our mom [50sF] is planning on flying out to visit me on surprise after a few years of minimal/no contact.


Link to the last post: https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/a91zv5/my_sister_27f_just_let_me_25f_know_that_our_mom/

I never ended up calling the cops. I mean, what would have been the point? But my sister called me again the other day. I know our mom's whole plan had made my sister see our mom in a different light (she and my other siblings were always treated better than I was).

My mom was supposed to visit in January.

Then it was March.

Now it's October. 

Apparently my mother, after years of alcohol and chain smoking, its starting to catch up to her. According to my sister, my mom's been using a mobility scooter and an oxygen tank for the past couple of months and cites that as the reason why our mom is having difficulty ""visiting"" me. My sister isn't sure that our mom would even be able to travel in October anyways. 

I want to feel bad but I don't. 

TL;DR: Psycho mom was going to fly across the country to ""surprise"" (i.e. harass) me but apparently can't due to recent health problems."
3,"UPDATE - My (30f) sister (33f) periodically fires verbal abuse at me and blaming her psychiatric disorder (BPD). I can't bring myself to forgive and forget.


Link to original post - https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/as8ijf/my_30f_sister_33f_periodically_fires_verbal_abuse/

I'd like to say a massive thank you to everyone who took the time to respond to my post! I was over the moon with how many people replied. The advice I received was very insightful and useful. I used bits of everyone's answers to compose a letter to my sister before speaking to her on the phone. The letter consisted of sentiments of love and understanding, but also emphasised how her behavior has to stop, and that she needs to seek DBT therapy. I also set very specific boundaries in place and asked her to agree to them. I gave her a heads up via Whatsapp that the email had been sent to to ask her to read it and think on it before we spoke.

Her reaction was very positive -

""I just want to say thank you, thank you from the bottom of my heart, for writing this letter. I am so incredibly grateful and so moved, that you would do this for me after all I have said to you and on top of that having to deal with being sleep deprived and having baby issues. I honestly I am in tears right now because I truly thought that I would have to try and rebuild our relationship on my own and honestly I haven't got the tools or knowledge to know how to do that and I've been so stressed not really knowing what to do or say but knowing that I need to resolve things. I also knew that we needed to set some rules and understandings to help you cope with the situation should it happen again and so I know the consequences if things get too bad and this will hopefully help me to get myself out of it. We'll talk more about this on the phone but this is so good for me. Sorry I haven't covered everything in your email but I don't have much time, just on my lunch break. But I wanted to thank you for taking the time to research and then write down your thoughts, it does mean a lot because you mean so much to me and I don't know what I would do if we didn't keep in contact, not saying that to hold you emotionally hostage or anything, I would be ok, just know that you mean alot and it's incredibly important to me that I stay on good terms with the family. We can discuss the therapy thing when we talk. Hope you have a good day xxxx""

I'm so happy that she didn't misinterpret anything from my letter and that it went down so well. Good people of Reddit, you may very well have saved my friendship with my sister! I'm very grateful! Let's hope what she says is more than just words and are turned into actions. Have a lovely day, everyone!

TLDR - After receiving Reddit advice, I wrote a letter to my sister. She was very happy and has agreed to improve."
4,"UPDATE: My (22f) Aunt (50f) might be getting baited by a guy she 'met' on instagram and I don't know how to talk to her about it.


 

Original post here: [https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/anrfe8/my\_22f\_aunt\_50f\_might\_be\_getting\_baited\_by\_a\_guy/](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/anrfe8/my_22f_aunt_50f_might_be_getting_baited_by_a_guy/)

So, a couple people asked for an update. Hope I'm formatting it right.

After making the original post, I couldn't get the situation off my mind - it was driving me nuts and really just stressing me out. I talked it over with my mom, and asked my aunt to send me some pics of 'Andy'. She asked why, and I told her that I wanted to compare them to the painting of him she'd started.

So I acquired the pictures, then did a reverse image search as many of you suggested. Thank goodness she sent me more than one picture of the guy, because only the last one got a hit, but from there, it was smooth sailing. Turns out the REAL guy is a poplar instagram model. He's got info about him being a Marine, and having a dog with the same name as Andy's dog right in his bio. This dude was so lazy he just lifted the real man's basic info.

The DOG even has an instagram, and I found more photos Andy sent to her. And to make my life even easier, the real guy has a series of videos up in his Highlights section labeled 'SCAMMERS'. I watched them and basically it was him addressing what to do if someone is being catfished with his pics. I was super nervous, but confident I had what I needed.

So from there, I slept on it, and then asked my aunt if I could come visit. My mom helped me stay calm beforehand, and the worst part leading up to it was standing in their house saying hello and just waiting to drop the bomb.

I started off with saying 'there's actually a reason i'm here. I have something to tell you, and you won't like it.'

I explained my motives for getting Andy's pics, the reverse image search, and finding the real guy. I pulled up his profile, and the dog's, and let her scroll through it while answering questions she and my grandma had. She tried to call Andy, text him, and just...it was weird guys. She used the phrase ""I'll go psycho on his ass"" in several variants. She never struck me as that type of person, but she was just blowing him up, and of course, when she FINALLY got ahold of him, and asked him to explain what I'd found. ugh, his voice. She had him on speakerphone.

""Baby, what you saying?"" (this was basically his answer to everything she said.)

""Baby, we don't need this. You just gotta trust.""

I wanted to grab the phone and tell him to cut his crap, but didn't. I stayed a couple more hours, answering questions, trying to console her. Apparently they'd actually been talking for like...two years? I'm torn on whether or not to believe that, bc as much as I love my aunt, i know from experience she can bend the truth to fit delusions sometimes. Anyways.

My grandma, who was there the whole time, was being her usual brusque self, so I pulled her aside and tried to explain that this wasn't the time for tough love, but for the band-aid-and-kisses type of motherly support. She agreed, and thanked me, saying that she's been seeing my aunt 'change', but she didn't say how. After we went back into the main room, she was trying to be a little more sensitive, but it doesn't come naturally to her.

From there, I needed to go to work and take care of something before the work day ended.

Since then, unfortunately, it seems that despite my warnings that she would not get anything that could be guaranteed as the truth out of Andy, she insisted on 'demanding explanations' and now he's got her convinced that everything they had was real, and that a friend had dared him into the deception. So now, according to her, ""they are talking, and there's a lot of trust to rebuild.""

I'm saddened by the turn of events, but I did my job, and she's an adult who has to make her own choices. I'm trying to let go of the outcome, which obviously wasn't he one I hoped for, and to not feel hurt. I know she's going through a lot emotionally, and that it was silly to hope my intervention would change things. Hopefully, she'll see the truth of it sooner rather than later, and I can have played a part in that.

Tl;dr: I found the instagram of the real guy that Andy was stealing pics from, and took the information to my aunt to tell her she was being catfished. She cried, asked questions, I comforted for a few hours then left, advising her to cut off contact with him. Unfortunately she didn't, since then, he's told her 'it was a dare' and they are 'talking and rebuilding trust.'"
5,"How can I [16M] cheer my sister [16F] who had an eye removed for health reasons?


She had her eye removed two days ago. there was no other choice because other treatments were ineffective she had a serious illness, so she has one eye now.

She's recovering but she says she's dizzy and disoriented all the time and is crying a lot. Yesterday she asked me to sleep next to her because she didn't want to be alone and wanted me to hold her a little bit, which I dont think she had ever done before, also nausea and headaches everywhere,

shell have another appointment in a few days but it's been hard for her so far. we havent always gotten along well but it hurts to see her like that.

what can I do to help her and cheer her up? doc says the physical stuff should disappear in a couple of days. what can I do for her until then and after?

**tl;dr:** sister had one eye removed and is feeling bad physically and emotionally, what can I do cheer her up a bit or make her feel better?"
6,"I (F, 28) was told by my partner of 10 years (M, 30) that he doesn't want to get married or have kids and its left me heartbroken, confused and depressed. He didn't expect me to react like this. I don't know what to do.


My boyfriend and I started dating in 2009, we were instant best friends, we fell for each other hard. Ten years later and we've travelled the world, lived in another country, bought a house and we're deep into our careers. We have a good life, we're not rich, but we're stable, we play sport together, we share a lot of the same views and despite how long it's been, I'm always excited to see him in the morning and at the end of the day. It's wonderful.

&amp;#x200B;

Lately a lot of our close friends have started getting engaged and having children. A lot. All three of my best friends are engaged. It's kind of swirling around us and we get the question all the time, ""when are you two getting married!"" and we always just shrug and say, ""eventually"". We're happy as we are, it's true, but I always figured we really would eventually get there, in our own way. It's not a topic that comes up often, but we've mentioned it. He once said he didn't want to raise kids in the city we live in now, I said that was OK, we can move when we're ready. He doesn't like the money people spend on weddings and the pressure to do everything perfect and so 'cookie cutter'. I agreed with him, I'd prefer a small wedding with maybe a food truck. 

&amp;#x200B;

A week ago he sat me down and told me he doesn't think he ever wants to get married or have kids. He just doesn't picture it. I asked him if this was a symptom of everyone else getting married etc and him feeling the pressure and he said he didn't know. He just doesn't want it. He said he might still feel this way in ten years and wanted me to know now because he felt bad. 

&amp;#x200B;

I got upset. I cried. I was confused. I'm glad he told me, that he was honest. But I would have preferred he at least ask me what my thoughts were, what I wanted, before just laying that on me. It's like he just wanted to get it off his chest then move on.

&amp;#x200B;

I've been in shock for a week, hardly eating, sleeping and feeling like shit. He didn't expect me to react like this. I tried talking to him about it again today and he just had no answers. I want us to work through this, find a way to figure out why he feels this way and if it's truly permanent. I can't fathom not being with him, he's my life. I love him. But I don't know if I can go on knowing I will never marry, never be a mother. I just don't know what to do next. We've been so distant and awkward around each other ever since he told me. I hate it, I want out life back.

&amp;#x200B;

Please, does anyone have advice? Have you been through this? I told one of my GFs and she just blew up, called him an idiot, told me to leave him. I don't need that. I want to work through this first, I want to try and save our relationship. 

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR: Boyfriend of ten years doesn't want kids or marriage, but I do eventually. I want to work through it and save our relationship but I don't know how. "
7,"My (30m) family loves my ex and is expressing that openly in front of my current girlfriend (27f). It is damaging our relationship.


I was in a relationship with my ex for 7 years and it ended 4 years ago. She was getting along with my parents (especially mother) and sisters really well and she was even living with us during our studies. 

I understand that after living with her for years and her being the part of our lives for so long they are fond of her. However, she dumped me (she felt she outgrew our relationship and felt too young to commit forever) and it hurt me a lot. Despite of the fact that I suffered a lot when she left me, they still like her. 

A year ago I met my current girlfriend and she is amazing, she helped me a lot to get over some issues I still had from my previous relationship. I am finally happy again. 

The problem is, my family is still openly fond of my ex and they are not hiding it at all. 

Few examples: Pictures including her, her postcards etc all around my parents flat. 

Mixing info about my gf and my ex repeatedly. ‘It is so cool that you do swimming’ - she doesn’t, but my ex did. 

Stories including my ex or even about her: Oh it was so good that ex’s mum was a cook, we loved to go there to eat etc. They also tell stories mentioning that she was great, pretty, similar to my gf in some regards. 

It is affecting my girlfriend a lot. At the beginning she didn’t complain and she always told me she understood they cared about my ex. But after few months her mood got worse anytime she met my family, even if they didn’t say anything.

She told me she feels like a replacement for my ex, as if there was a ghost between us all. I told her I would talk to them but she said that even if they stopped talking about her now, she would always feel it was only because I asked them to. She says she feels deeply uncomfortable with them now even when they do nothing wrong. 

I think it is important to add that my gf is really not jealous generally and even talked to me about my ex a lot when I needed to vent. So I think my family is wrong here, but I know if I tell them something they will defend themselves (my ex was part of their lives for so long) and even if they stopped my gf would still be uncomfortable. 

What can I do? 

Tl;dr: My (30m) family loves my ex and is expressing that openly in front of my current girlfriend (27f). It is damaging our relationship.

8,"My (25F) family seems to view me as their emergency fund


 They (mom, older sister, and older brother) only call or message me whenever they're in need and would ask for money, 50 here, 1000-2000 there, multiple times over the last few years. I have a soft spot for them and would rarely say no. Recently my brother got into legal troubles and I ended up using most of my emergency fund to cover the lawyer fees, storage fees to move his stuff out of his house, and my sister's tax debt. I couldn't say no because I don't want him to end up in prison. My mom expected me to have $$$ money ready, to post his bail, which I don't. I don't ""lend"" them it, because I don't expect it back. But looking back, no one ever asked how I was doing, what was going on in my life, just a ""hey we are in trouble, can you help us out? Thanks, I'll pay you back"". They never pay me back. They know how much I make (which is a lot compared to them) and probably use it to justify it. But I have financial goals and I can't be their emergency fund. I really want to cut them off but I can't seem to do it. What if they're in big trouble and need my help? Just looking for advice and wondering if people have been in a similar situation.

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR: My family treats me as their emergency fund. I don't want to be ruthless and cut them off / go no contact because what if they're in dire need? Need advice."
9,"My [24F] best friend [27F] replaced me as godmother to her baby with no explanation. How do I talk to her about it?


I’m not really sure how to start this post so I’ll just give some backstory first:

One of my best friends lives in a different country. We met years ago online and have talked almost daily to what is approaching a decade. We have both flown back and forth once or twice a year to see the other and hang out, and we’ve always been their for each other’s big moments. 

She found out last year that she is expecting her first child, and it was amazing news for us all, I was so happy for her to start the family I know she’s always wanted with her husband [31M]. She came to visit a few months into her pregnancy and asked me to be the baby’s godmother - I was over the moon. 
While we live an 8 hour plane ride from each other, I do have a job that gives me decent vacation allowance and deals with certain airlines that makes visiting manageable. I knew that I could be there for her, and told her that whenever she was ready for someone outside of the family to be there, I would make the trip. 


Last month, she had her baby shower, and I only found out when I saw on Instagram a mutual friend [28F] who lives in the same city as me, had surprised her at the shower. I hadn’t been invited. I was a little hurt, and surprised, but it was the busiest month of the year for the company I work for, and I knew she knew that, so I figured that could be the reason, sent my gift by airmail and said congratulations. 

However now she’s reached out to me, and told me that she has asked another friend (the same person who went to the baby shower) to be the baby’s godmother, and that she only wants her child to have one. I felt like I’d been punched in the gut. I was heartbroken, and felt a bit betrayed, for 6 months I have been excited to take on the role - my own godmother lives in New Zealand, and has done for most of my life, so I knew it could work.m, knew how to stay in contact and be a part of the child’s life while living in another country. But now she’s taken back her offer, and chosen someone else.

I wouldn’t be so upset if she had chosen someone who lived closer, but she has replaced me with someone who lives in the same city as me, so it’s not a distance thing. We have been friends for years, I have been there with updates, support and love her whole pregnancy, and at no point was there any clue she had changed her mind... until the baby shower a few weeks ago. 

I don’t know if I should confront her, tell her I’m hurt, or just accept her decision, it’s her baby, and I would never want to force her into a decision she wasn’t happy with. I just don’t know what to do or say to her now. I want to let her know I’m sad that I’m missing out, but I don’t want to sound like I’m whining, and I want to know why she changed her mind, but I’m scared the answer will just upset me. What should I do? 


TL:DR: My best friend asked me to be the godmother of her child months ago, now, with the due date approaching, she’s chosen someone else and given no explanation. How do I tell her that hurts without sounding selfish? "
10,"I [37/F] absolutely cannot stand my coworker [48/F] - How can I deal with this woman?


Have you ever just met someone who embodies everything you hate? This is that person for me. We work in a very small department (for about 2 years now) and she is practically within arms length of me. Why cannot I not stand her? Well..

She talks all day long. To me, to others, to her sister on the phone, etc. If you don't talk to her, she gets her feelings hurt and then huffs and puffs all day long. Or she leaves and goes to some other department to talk about us. 

She fights with someone at least once a day. Me, her husband, her sister, our boss. Speaking of which...

If I say ""it's a nice day out"" - I will get 100 reasons back on why it isn't a nice day. She can literally argue about anything with anyone. The one time I stopped the ""fight"" and told her I didn't care about what we were arguing about - she cried for the rest of the afternoon. 

I get constant commentary on my actions - especially with food (I am on a diet and SHOULD be). God forbid I don't eat the amount of food she thinks I should. It is like having the mother you never wanted telling you your not eating enough. OH...she is also a ""vegan"" (Except for the **bacon** she eats every morning). 

So we get preachy commentary also about meat, straws, recycling, animals, tree-hugging (literally) etc. All while she eats bacon, uses 100 Styrofoam cups a day, has non-neutered pets etc. Basically shes a hypocrite. 

Gotta go to the bathroom? Well you should have asked her also if she needed to go so you both could go together. If its time to go to a meeting together she will yell rudely ""are we going or not?"". She acts like we are all joined at the hip. 

Are you cold? Well she is colder. Are you sick? She's been sicker. Family member died? Well hers are deader. We are always in some weird competition with her. Especially if it has to do with being seen as small, sickly, victim-y. It is so bizarre. 


She doesn't pull her weight at work. She is hidden from our bosses view - so she spends hours on her phone. If you try to get her to help out or cover for someone on vacation she gives about 100 reasons why she can't or just flat out doesn't do what she says she will. 

My boss is useless in this situation (shes a pushover). I wear earbuds but we are so close that unless I blow out my eardrums, I can hear all of this. I am at the point where I am considering quitting over her. I am a really laid back, introverted person and she exhaust me. I get this dread on Sunday afternoon from having to be around her again. Anyone have any suggestions on how to deal with her. My job is otherwise a pretty sweet situation, I would like to keep it for awhile. Thanks!

TLDR - How do you deal with a co-worker who gets under your skin like it's their job?

11,"Got a new job and coworker (21F) won’t leave me (20M) alone


So I got my dream job a few weeks ago and I’m really enjoying it and many of the people are very friendly. I was at one spot at work on Friday where I was working with a coworker I just met that day and we started having some small talk. 

I’m new so she was essentially just giving me the rundown of things that I didn’t learn in my training and stuff like that. We get off work and are walking together back to our cars since we parked closely together. She starts talking about how she lives in a toxic home and her father is incredibly ill and she can’t sleep at night due to her anxiety. Okay a bit weird but I’ll deal. 

The next day she wasn’t scheduled to come in till after I’m off but she decided to come in early and was hanging around me talking. She said that she came in early due to arguments happening at home No biggie I understand that she would want to get away. 

After I get off she starts sending me Facebook messages asking how I’m liking the job and it’s all good. I respond and say goodnight and then when I wake up in the morning I see a good morning text from her. I don’t respond. A few hours later I get another FB message and then a message on Snapchat from her and then she calls me via FB asking why I’m not responding. 

I haven’t gone more than like 3 hours without her sending me another message. She’s started asking me how I like my coffee since she wants to bring me some next time I’m working. It’s honestly really annoying getting a constant text from her yet I can’t really tell her to leave me alone since we work together. She literally told me that I’m her favorite coworker. We’ve worked together for an hour. 

What am I supposed to do in this situation? I’ve only known her for like 3 days at this point and she will not stop leaving me alone. Sure we can be friends but I really don’t want her to call me asking why I’m not responding when I barely know her.

TL;DR: got a new job and coworker keeps messaging me despite only knowing her for a short time. "
12,"I (25F) am thinking about moving out of my boyfriend's (29M) house because he doesn't clean.


I'm 25, my boyfriend is 29. We've been together 4 years, lived together for 3.

I'm trying to decide whether or not to move out of my boyfriend's house. We've lived together for three years. I love him a lot, and I feel like it's been a great relationship. The house is his, I just pay part of the mortgage and utilities (he's an engineer and I'm a student, so he makes a lot more than I do).

He never--EVER--cleans up after himself. When we first started dating, I always made it really clear that I'm not looking to be anyone's wife, I'm not the type of girl who wants to clean all day and raise kids. That isn't me. When we first moved in together he was a bit messy but it wasn't like he never cleaned. Then, over time...I started doing more and more of the cleaning. I fully realize that this is partially my fault, because I would clean up after him and he would get used to it.

But it's gotten totally out of hand. He will leave dirty dishes until there's mold growing in them. I've seriously found cereal bowls in his office that were full of maggots. I have never seen him vaccuum or wipe down a surface. And I can't live in the mess, so it seems like I end up cleaning everything because I won't stay sane otherwise.

I've tried talking to him about how much this stresses me out. I've tried having serious talks about it, and I've tried being light and offhand like ""Hey man, could you take out the trash today?"" He NEVER does any chores on his own, he'll only do it if I ask. And usually he'll only do it after I've been asking for a few days. And usually there's some sighing and some eye rolling, like ""Why is this such a big deal?""

Occasionally he'll make a big effort and get something clean, but it's very, very occasionally. Like once or twice a year.

I'm tired. I feel like he's not taking me seriously. I feel like he doesn't understand why it would be an issue for someone to live surrounded by trash and mold and gunk. And I feel like he doesn't think my time is as valuable as his. And any time I try to bring it up or talk about it, he's annoyed, or ""doesn't want to deal with this right now.""

So I'm really thinking about moving out. The upsides: a much shorter commute, and a clean living environment.

The down sides: living alone for the first time in my life, it's more expensive, and I'd lose him.

I know I'm not putting this in the best light, but other than being a total slob he's a pretty great guy. He's done a lot for me. He's kind, intelligent, fit, going places in life, and we have a lot of great conversations and fun adventures together. I don't know that I want to lose the relationship. But I'm so insanely tired of being uncomfortable in my living environment.

Advice?

TLDR Summary: My BF and I have been together 4 years. We're both busy. He never cleans up after himself and I'm sick of doing it. Should I move out?"
13,"My [29M] fiancée [30F] is obsessed with her side business, and it's taking over our lives.


Background: I'm a graduate student, just wrapping up my PhD, living in LA. My fiancée and I have been dating for two years, and engaged for three months. She works in corporate strategy at a big company. Neither of us make a lot of money, we live in a tiny 1 BR/BA.

Recently, one of our friends [27F] started selling jewelry and other little handmade trinkets via an online store (Etsy). It's going well, she's selling about one thing a day and making a bit of money on the side.

I'm pretty sure my fiancée got envious. She's artsy at heart, and often looked for a side-gig. After our friend started selling crafts, my fiancée tried her hand at a number of things -- jewelry, pottery, etc. until she settled on paper flowers.

My fiancée has made _thousands_ of paper flowers over the past two months. 

She's been trying to sell them online, and has gotten some success -- selling a few dollars' worth every day. That wasn't enough though, so she's also been selling them at markets, fairs, and plainly on the streets after work. 

However, the paper flowers don't make much money. Though we're not ""well off"" by any means, she still makes more money at her day job. 

But I've caught her skipping her day job to sell flowers! In the last two weeks, she's actually been taking sick days and ""working from home"" in the mornings, telling her boss she's on calls or stuck in traffic when she's actually spending the first three hours of the day going door-to-door hawking paper flowers.

And don't get me wrong. They're nice flowers. She's doing a great job at making them, and her drive is impressive. But I feel as if it's an obsession that's taking over her life, when she should be prioritizing her real work, and frankly, our relationship. We've been less intimate and have had less time for dates and other fun things because she's always working on the paper flowers. The closest we get these days is when I help her bring flower packages to the post office, or when I'm helping her take photos of the flowers. Stuff like that. I feel like I've become an accessory to her side business (which, I repeat, doesn't actually make much money at all). 

It's had impacts in other ways as well. Hanging out with our friends is a struggle now, because my fiancée doesn't want to talk about anything but the flowers. She's always carrying some in her purse, showing them off, and if a friend shows only a little bit of interest, my fiancée will try to sell them some. It's awkward. 

I have no idea what to do. I'm considering taking a break and moving back in with my parents (also in LA) for a few weeks while hoping for her to stabilize. But that seems extreme. What should I do?

**TL;DR;** : Fiancée is obsessed with her arts-and-crafts side business, which doesn't make a lot of money, but it's totally taking over her life, hurting her other priorities and our relationship. What should I do?"
14,"My (26F) Mom (50F) is Insistent that I Reconnect with a Childhood Friend I Cut Contact With


I met my friend Jamie during middle school, I had moved and didn't know anyone, she sort of adopted me and we formed a small close-knit group of friends. We saw each other through a lot of tough times, I supported her heavily during several periods of self harm and depression that she went through. I stopped her from committing suicide on at least three occasions where I caught her just before the unthinkable happened. We were there for each other through our first loves, and heartbreaks. I know she was in love with me at several points, and even after turning her down we could talk about it and still be okay. Most things were like that, we could talk about almost anything, and then just laugh and carry on. High school was an entirely different beast, however. 

We started having different classes and drifted a little. She began to get into drugs and partying and I saw less of her. Our friend group tried to support her and get her help (she had graduated to hard drugs) we thought she was actively trying to quit, but it turned out to all be lies. She would lie to continue her lifestyle and was self- harming in secret. We had a huge falling out junior year when she almost tanked my AP English grade because she had neglected to work on any of her part of a group project that was 50% of the class grade (they caught her on school grounds doing hard drugs and the teacher still was reluctant to let us submit the project without her). 

We tried to have one last 'Come to Jesus' talk with her about our friendship and her health, but she made it clear that she put the drugs and casual hookups above all else. I forcefully went no contact with her. I felt a lot of guilt over it for a long time, even though I felt it was the right decision. My senior year was my only happy one of high school, without any drama, and I began to recognize how toxic our relationship had become when it was no longer there. I also found out after the fact that there was a lot more she had been keeping from me, including that she stole from me (items from my house), had cheated with my boyfriend at the time and also knew he was doing drugs/cheating with other girls and never told me.

H'okay, so my mom ran into her recently at a co-worker's relative's wake. She remembers Jamie; and she knows we didn't part on good terms, but she doesn't know all of the details even though she knows she stole from me and was heavily into drugs and those were major factors in the end of the friendship. My mother decided to approach Jamie and ask her about reconnecting with me, and apparently Jamie was ecstatic over this idea. My mom encouraged her and said she'd have me reach out to her because it was, ""about time"". My mom told me all this at a family brunch out at a restaurant. I got the whole speech about how good she looks,  how she's changed, I guess she's married now and is Born-Again. I instantly shut it down and told my mom I really didn't care to hear it and would appreciate if she wouldn't bring it up again or attempt to talk to Jamie again, let alone tell her I'm interested in talking/meeting up. I reiterated that there were a lot of reasons we aren't friends anymore and I'd like to leave it at that. 

Ever since though she'll still occasionally try to bring it up and make me feel extremely guilty about it. My other friends who knew her, and my husband, support not making contact with her, but my mom seems to be on this crusade that I'm inconsiderate and mean for responding this way, and that ""people change"" and implying I'm not giving her a chance. I'm genuinely glad for Jamie if she's found her happiness, but I feel as though this isn't a can of worms I want to re-open. I don't know why this is important to my mom, and I'd really like her to stop. I still feel like I made the right decision, but when she brings this up I remember our friendship when it was good and I start to second guess myself a little and go back to that place of guilt. 

TL;DR: I cut out a childhood friend a long time ago who became toxic. My mom ran into her recently and promised we'd reconnect, agaisnt my wishes. Mom is making me feel guilty and sometimes I have a twinge of regret for how things ended. "
15,"I (40f) am somehow just waking up to a nightmare with him (45m) and I feel scared.


I have no explanation. I know some of you will judge me for my foolishness at my age, but you'd be right. I have no excuse and I can't even understand my own actions.

&amp;#x200B;

5 years ago I met someone at work I really clicked with. I was lonely and had been divorced for 3 years. My ex husband had moved on, and I had 50-50 custody of our 10 year old twins.  When they weren't with me, I felt really empty.  My co-worker became my friend (he was fun, funny, charming and a great distraction) and soon we started dating.  2 years later I moved in with him and his 12 year old daughter.

&amp;#x200B;

I spent a lot of time preparing my twins for us moving in and becoming a blended family and they loved his daughter and everything seemed to go great.

&amp;#x200B;

However, during the past 3 years I have discovered one red-flag after another with regards to other women.  Each time I would freak out. He would downplay everything. He always had explanations. He would say I was over-reacting. He'd completely cut ties with the woman in question. Life was super-busy, he would plan a nice get-away, someone would get sick, etc etc. Life just moved along quickly and I just would ""get over"" things (well, stuff them down and not deal with them I suppose).  I'd also start to sort of question if I maybe was being over-the-top in my reactions. I really truly believe he's never been physically unfaithful. But maybe I'm just an idiot.

&amp;#x200B;

It was things like getting nudes from some woman he went to high school with.  Then I'd find a text conversation left on the iPad between him and his female buddy he went to college with talking about sex (him asking if she likes this or likes that).  A drunken text to an ex girlfriend asking for one more night together.  An email to his female co-worker calling her baby and telling her he misses her.  I'd find that he'd given huge tips to female waitresses at the bar he frequents. I found flirty comments on various women's photos on facebook. Etc. 

&amp;#x200B;

Each and every time I'd flip out. Each time he'd downplay, cut all contact and distract me. Well, life distracted me really.  Also, our ""family"" life at home was wonderful, and the kids were all thriving and happy. They got a new puppy. We had family meals and vacations and we moved into a new home.

&amp;#x200B;

Nothing has happened in about 6 months (at least that I know of).  Life is quieter at the moment. And suddenly, all these memories are hitting me at once.  Last night I sat down and wrote them all out and just stared at them and I felt nauseated.  And many of them were 3 years ago, so it's really difficult to get mad about it now.  He feels it's all been dealt with. He insists he is now striving to be the partner I deserve.

&amp;#x200B;

But.....when I look at it all written out in black and white I realize he's got serious issues.  He's a cheater.  He may very well have been screwing other women all along (but I still don't believe that).

&amp;#x200B;

I looked in the living room and our kids were sprawled out on the sofa together with our dog on top of them watching a movie. They had all gone skiing earlier.  He and I have a wine and cheese party planned for next weekend.  The second week of March, we are going on a romantic long-weekend getaway.  But I looked at him tonight and felt like I don't even know him. He's obviously betrayed me repeatedly, lied to me and gotten away with it. Because I let him. And I feel panicked because I want out but I'm scared of screwing up our kids (plus I can't currently support myself).  I feel like the ultimate failure.

&amp;#x200B;

*tldr.* ***bf has had many suspicious incidents with other women over the past 3 years, and each time I find out and freak out he rug sweeps, and for some reason I've let him.  Tonight I made myself look at a list of the incidents and I realized I can't stay. But I don't know how to leave.***"
16,"My (f38) best friend died five years ago. Now im dating her husband (m38).


  

Five years ago my best friend was killed by a drunk driver. She was 34 years old and happily married with a son who was back then 1 year old. Before he was born she asked me to become his godmother. I happily agreed.

The time after her passing was terrible for all of us. I often help to look after her son. He likes me and I am important to him but as much as a stepmother. (I also did never moved in with them.

In the meantime her husband and I got closer. Recently we both realized that we are in love.

I was basically single for the entire time. As opposed to my late friend I am very shy and very introverted. She often tried to set me up with guys, but it was never really successful.

He went to a single date since her passing.

I really want this to work and the stakes are obviously really high. So how can we make our relationships work? How can we tell his son? How can we tell his parents and his parents-in-law? (They are very helpful in raising their grandson.) 

**TL;DR: I started to date my late best friends husband.** "
17,"Update: My (28f) boyfriend (29M) won’t discuss marriage


My original post didn’t get much traction, but wanted to give an update nonetheless. 

[original post](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/9wg3hf/my_28f_boyfriend_29m_wont_discuss_marriage/?st=JSN3PEQX&amp;sh=85c23c66https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/9wg3hf/my_28f_boyfriend_29m_wont_discuss_marriage/?st=JSN3PEQX&amp;sh=85c23c66)

I asked him directly if he wanted to marry me, he said he didn’t know. It was different than previous answers and felt like a slap in the face; I asked him to leave the next day. He was extremely upset, I’ve actually never seen him so emotional. He told me he understood, but he loved me, I was his favorite person in the world, and he didn’t want to lose me. 

He’s been staying at his sister’s for the past week. We talked last night, and he reiterated that he loved me, but was scared of marriage, scared of getting older, and scared of divorce. We talked through a lot of what he was feeling, and it sounds like it’s largely a fear of settling down and being old. His thirtieth is Saturday, so I know that’s playing into it. 

I’m just sad and honestly, a little angry. Last night’s conversation felt like an hour of me talking about his feelings and counseling him and convincing him that marriage can be a positive thing. He also told me he made plans to travel to Montana next week, which hurt and I can’t explain why. I’m just sad. And I don’t understand why you would throw away an otherwise good relationship where you already live together because you’re scared of the formal commitment. I don’t get it.

I don’t really know what I’m looking for here. Last night’s talk made me feel like I have to do the work of convincing him. I feel like I don’t matter. I don’t know what to do or how to feel and I guess I just need some perspective. 

TL;DR: Separated from my boyfriend because he didn’t know if he wanted to get married, feel like I’m still doing the work to save the relationship and am not sure what to do

"
18,"My (22M) GF (21F) encouraged her best girl friend to cheat on her boyfriend with one of my good friends. We are in a huge argument over it.


 

I (22M) have been dating my gf (21F) for a year, and we are both in our last year of college. Yesterday, her best friend (I'll refer to her as K) from another college was visiting and we went out to bars last night. Girlfriends best friend has a boyfriend, who I've met twice and who was not with us last night.

For the most part, our night was going great. I was getting along with K and she was getting along with all of my guy friends we were out with. Around midnight, my girlfriend tells me that K wants to hook up with a boy tonight, and that K thought one of my friends was hot. As she says this, K jumps into the conversation. Suddenly I feel on the spot for deciding whether K should cheat on her boyfriend with one of my good friends. K tells me she is planning on breaking up with her boyfriend in a couple months anyways. I tell her she shouldn't cheat and should break up with him now if that's how she feels. This is when I removed myself from the conversation. I partly just didn't want to deal with it but I also wanted to see what my girlfriend would tell K to do. 

The night goes on and my gf and K are sitting in the corner chatting in a secretive way. Meanwhile, I let my good friend know that K is interested in him, but I made it clear she has a boyfriend and that it's probably best he doesn't get involved. He agrees and says he's not really interested. However, he's a single guy and if an attractive girl is dead set on going home with him, I know he wouldn't turn her down. I just wanted to be straightforward with him.  

Moving forward to when we leave the bar to go home. The four of us (myself, gf, K, and my guy friend) walk out together. When we get outside, my gf and I start walking to her house, but instead of K coming with us, my gf basically tells her to go home with my friend. My friend gives me a weird look, knowing K has a boyfriend, but I don't say anything in the moment. Maybe I gave him a shrug, as if to say ""it's her choice."" K says goodbye to us and walks away with my friend. Once it's just me and my gf, I express how uncomfortable the whole situation was and how I'm disappointed in how she encouraged her best friend to cheat. This caused gf to panic, start crying, and call K repeatedly trying to get her to not go home with my friend. She didn't answer, but after asking my friend this morning, he confirmed he did not hook up with K, and she slept on a couch at his house. 

Anyways, we ended up arguing for hours until like 4am. Basically, I am angry that she put me in a tough spot by asking me whether K should go home with my good friend. Furthermore, I am angry about how she facilitated K cheating on her boyfriend. I see this as a major red flag. Our arguing basically got us nowhere last night. I expressed my dissatisfaction, and she basically just kept deflecting and telling me ""I love you"" ""I wanna marry you someday"" and ""our relationship isn't like her friend K's."" My conclusion is that, at the moment, she's completely missing the point of why I am upset. 

So first, am I justified in being so upset over how my gf handled things last night? I know K can make her own decisions whether I like them or not, but I really feel like my gf egged her on. Second, how can I communicate why this is such a big deal to me and get her to understand my viewpoint. I'm seriously questioning my gf's morals and how she thinks about relationships right now. Thank you for any advice.

TLDR: GF encouraged her best friend to cheat on her boyfriend, with one of my good friends, last night. She put me in a tough spot between her, her friend, and my friend that I was not comfortable with. Now I am questioning my gf's morals and how she views relationships. "
19,"I was not invited to a friends (F32) wedding and now am bitter.


In this group of around 14 friends, there is 6 women (including myself) all around 32 years old, the most (including myself) of which attended high school together but expanded over University etc (so we have all known each other for at least 10 plus years). One recently had a wedding, and I was not invited. I knew a few of the others had attended. I was fine with that (she had wanted to have a small event), and I got her a card and some cash to give to her when I next saw her. 

The next chance I saw her was a Christmas party. So I took the card and my KrisKringle (KK) present. I spoke to her and everything seemed friendly, and congratulated her briefly on her wedding. I didn't mention the card I had, as I figured I would give it to her when KK was happening. 

As everyone sat down to start KK, she spoke up. She had gifts to give to the women in her wedding party as thanks. Which turned out to be every other woman in the friend group except me. I didn't say anything, and smiled and joked around with everyone else, but I was hurt by her actions. I had thought we were friends, and not being invited to a wedding in which every single mutual female friend not only attended but were part of the wedding party really made me question if she even likes me at all. 

I did not give her the card. Over the next 2-3 weeks I spent the cash I was going to give her as congratulations. This weekend the friends are all meeting up again. I could give her the cashless card, but I honest don't want to. I've tried to not let her actions make me bitter, but I haven't really spoken to her since then (but also haven't really been forced into a situation were I would have normally either). If I avoid her this weekend it will be very obvious, and this is really affecting how I see the group and myself, as none of the other women (or men) spoke to me about it either. Am I wrong to not congratulate her properly on her wedding in spite? How can I know if it was something about me that was the problem? How do I resolve this without causing drama between everyone?

TLDR; Bride doesn't invite me to a wedding which had all mutual female friends in wedding party and now I am bitter and unsure about entire friendship group. "
20,"My [27f] husband [33m] and his ex [33f] won't tell my stepson who is funding his education


My stepson is 8. I've been with his dad for 5 years, married for 1. I've been involved in my step son's life for 4 years. Last year, my step son was diagnosed with a learning disability that is not an insurmountable obstacle, but is bad enough that the specialist recommended a specialized school for him. 

Between my husband, my stepson's mom, and me, we didn't make enough to afford the school. My parents offered to pay, and my husband and my stepson's mom agreed because it was best for my stepson. My parents are generous people and just came into a large amount of money from my grandmother's passing, which they have put away entirely to fund their grandchildren' education. They also live on the other side of the country, so we rarely see them, but when we do, they definitely take on a grandparent role with my stepson. 

The thing is, my husband and his ex refuse to tell my stepson where the money for his education is coming from--ever. I don't think they need to tell him right now, but I think when he's older, it's unfair not to tell him that the reason he will graduate debt free from college is because of my parents' generosity. My step son's mom is open about the fact that she does not want him to know because she doesn't want her son to value my family's contribution over hers. My husband won't even engage with her over it, but I can tell he agrees with her and is uncomfortable with the difference in resources.

I'm not trying to do this so my stepson will like me more than his mom or anything like that, I just feel terribly for my parents because they aren't being recognized or thanked and never will be. On top of that, my stepson often asks why my parents don't come around very much and don't take him out and buy him gifts like his bio grandparents do, and it makes me so sad that he can't see what they're doing for him because they love him like they love their other grandkids.

My husband is refusing to engage with me about this and it's making me feel terrible. I know I'm just a step parent and not a bio parent, but it hurts me to see my family be treated like this. I just want my stepson to know one day so he can look back and understand that my parents love him much as they love their other grandkids. It's making me question how much my husband values me and how he sees me as a step mother. Am I wrong? Should I let it drop? I'm hurt but also very conflicted, because I want what's best for my stepson, but I also want my parents to feel appreciated.

tl;dr my parents are funding my stepson's education and no one will tell him"
21,"I [28F] want a man [60sM] who is not my father to walk me down the aisle. My mom [52F] basically had a breakdown.


So my fiance and I moved to a small town on the east coast about 3 years ago. We didn't know anyone, and it was quite far away from our family back west. We have two children, a girl who is 5, and a boy who is 7. Our closest neighbor was an older man, who I will call Tom.

I found out from someone else that Tom's wife and daughter died in a car crash some years ago. We felt bad for him, so we invited him to a barbeque. And he's been a staple in our lives ever since.

He is basically the sweetest man ever. My kids adore him. My father's parents are dead, and my mom's are the most unloving people you could meet, so Tom has become a replacement grandpa. He has a huge backyard, and he and my fiance built the kids a treehouse in it. They often go there after school. He cooks for them, he took our son fishing, he made our daughter a little dollhouse...he's just great, he clearly has so much love to give. And my fiance gets on great with him too, they often have a beer on the porch and chat about life. We have dinner together all the time. He feels like the father I never had. It almost feels like fate that we became neighbors.

I got the idea of asking Tom to walk me down the aisle at my wedding in July. My real father and I have a friendly relationship, but he's kind of a...drifter? Him and my mom split when I was small, and I barely saw him, he likes to travel the world. He sent some money, and called and sent gifts and cards and stuff, but he didn't fulfil the role of a dad. He's currently living in Thailand; he's not 100% sure if he'll make it the wedding. When I told him my idea of asking Tom to walk me down the aisle, he gave me the okay.

So I asked Tom if he would like to. He accepted, and said that these past couple of years have been his happiest in a long time. He cried. I cried. Then my mother cried when I called to tell her. But not in the good way.

My mom was raised super traditional. She was a good, loving mother, but she struggled with her family and acquaintances who criticized her for having a child with someone undependable like my father. She tries to hide it, but I know fine well this has been a sore spot for her. I've told her to ignore catty relatives etc, but she doesn't listen. And when I told her about Tom walking me down the aisle, she broke down. ""You can't let a strange man that isn't your father walk you down the aisle, what will [various relatives] think??"" (Note: for the past 2 years Tom has sent her christmas cards and cookies, and she has sent him cards and gifts too; they haven't met yet, but spoke on the phone and got along very well) She was borderline hysterical. I get that it's her old issues with being judged coming back to haunt her, but I don't know how to talk to her. She even said she didn't want to come to the wedding - also note that all these judgy relatives that I've invited, I invited for her, because she wanted them there.

I know how it sounds, crazy mom getting controlling about her daughter's wedding. But I have to stress that this is SO out of character for her. This is a woman who despises tattoos, but forced a smile and said ""lovely colors"" when I showed her mine! She tries her damn hardest to be loving, she's done a lot for me, and I'm at a loss now because it's been two weeks and she's barely talking to me - over what is, to me, a really lovely and positive thing. I also can't imagine not having her at my wedding.

How do I talk to her?

TL;DR: asked a lovely family friend to walk me down the aisle, mom having a breakdown over it, have no idea how to get over it"
22,"My [20F] best friend [19F] is accusing my boyfriend [24M] of abusing me after she told an embarrassing story, and got called out.




My story is a long and confusing one, so stick with me. 
My best friend (S) since childhood set up my current boyfriend (J) and I. Originally, I was told they met through tumblr and that they had been platonic friends since S was in middle school. After I found out I was moving to New York for school, S put me in contact with J to ask about neighborhoods, where to live, good bars/restaurants as well as establishing a friendship so I wouldn’t blindly move without a friend. Our relationship bloomed from this, and I have continued to date him as I have adjusted to life in NY. I repeatedly asked S if she was alright with me pursuing J before we had any sort of romantic contact and she repeatedly told me she never had feelings for him and that I had her blessing, and matter of fact she was actually overjoyed that I was dating someone she thought so highly of! 

Recently S came out to New York to visit me and see J as well.
During this time, the story came out of how S and J actually met. 
S “catfished” J when she was very young, around 14, while J was around 18. They had been strictly friends, S had pursued a romantic relationship with J, but this did not go anywhere, and this was shut down by J, gently, but firmly. Eventually when S came clean to J about her age he cut contact and flat out told her 

“I cannot talk to you while you are this age”. 

Fast forward 4 years, S reaches out to J as a friend, and they pick their friendship where they left off. Everything is great!

This story was told to me in front of my, and J’s group of mutual friends. S was sloppy drunk and thought it would be funny to share these details. Our friends were uncomfortable, I was uncomfortable, J was uncomfortable. I made efforts to stop her during her story, and she was oblivious. 

As I was the DD I immediately knew conflict was coming when it was time for us to leave. We all got Into my car and J told S how shitty it was of her to tell that story, and that while he wanted to be her friend, she needed to understand that it wasn’t something she should talk about in front of anyone, let alone friends of ours she was meeting for the first time. 
S immediately brought me into this situation by saying 

“That was a funny story, it wasn’t anything bad, like it was funny, right /u/ashittymagician? Right?”

Well I didn’t think so, and I made that very clear that I was siding with J in this situation. 

She at first apologized to J and myself, and was drunk crying and apologizing as I drove J home and myself and her to my home. 
But when she sobered up she changed her stance drastically. She was no longer sorry. 

Because of this situation S is accusing me of picking J over her, and in fact she is claiming J is actually abusive to me and that he was a criminal for talking to her while she was young, and that he was trying to “groom” her and now he’s trying to groom me as well.

I do not feel this way, I know for a fact that they had no romantic relationship, especially not after he found out her true age. 

It has also been brought to my attention that S confessed to J that she was developing feelings for me before I left for school around a year and a half ago. I was unaware of this. 

S has stopped speaking with me completely, and has been extremely hurtful towards me since this incident. 
She has since told me that she is uncomfortable with J and I dating (2 years into the relationship which she has supported up until this point). 

All of this has happened in the month of January. 

Am I the asshole for dating my friends “ex”? 
Am I the asshole for siding with my boyfriend?

TL;DR 
Friend catfished my boyfriend in middle school, told all of my adult friends how she did it, and can’t understand why I’m upset.
"
23,"I think my husband’s friend (37F) is using her new baby to get to my husband.


  

I’ve been with my husband Matt (35M) for six years. My husband has a huge social circle, and I’ve become very close with a lot of them. One in particular though, we’ll call her Mary, has always thought of herself and my husband as “best friends”, even though Matt would not describe her as such. They never dated, but Mary would use my husband as a sort of ‘emotional boyfriend’ before her husband came along, and they drifted a bit more once Matt and I started dating. Mary and I have always been really friendly to each other, but she’s very odd about communication. She will ONLY message Matt. If I message her about something, or Matt messages her within a group chat that I’m included in, she will always respond only to Matt. 

&amp;#x200B;

Fast forward to now, Mary and her husband just had a baby 10 months ago, and they’ve named a friend of Mary’s as Godmother, and my husband as the Godfather. 

&amp;#x200B;

My husband and I aren’t religious; neither is Mary or her husband, so we were a little surprised by this but thought it was nice. We bought them nice gifts when the baby was born, and have visited a few times. About the amount of involvement new parents want from their friends in the first year, I would think – there, but not ALWAYS there. 

&amp;#x200B;

Apparently this is not good enough for Mary. She is very upset with Matt for not taking a more “active role” in his Godson’s life. He apparently never asks how the baby is (what is a 10 month old going to be other than “fine”?). Mary was mad that Matt didn’t come to the baby’s first doctor’s appointment – even though she didn’t invite the baby’s Godmother. Last month they redid the baby’s nursery, and she wanted Matt to come along to pick out the furniture. Matt and I are visiting my parents the weekend she requested, so he declined, but when Mary tried to reschedule Matt told her it was a little odd and he just plum didn’t want to go. 

&amp;#x200B;

The most recent thing, is they’re approaching the first birthday. Mary texts Matt constantly about party themes, cake ideas, food ideas, decorations…he  usually says something like “wife and I love this!” And even if I send her a message asking her how she or the baby is doing or saying I love the new nursery or the cake she sent Matt etc etc, she will leave my message read and then respond only to Matt. Mary has asked Matt to come early to help set up – she specified “Just you Matt”. Not the Godmother, or me. Matt said he would, because after the nursery thing he felt things were a little strained between him and Mary. But I feel very odd about it. I’m tired of this “Mary and Matt Only” club that she’s tried to cultivate for years, and I just need to know if I’m justified in my annoyance here, and what can I do about it? 

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR: My husband’s friend is using her new baby to get closer to my husband, what can I do about it? "
24,"Friend [34F] is marrying her long term abusive partner [35M] and has asked me [34F] to be maid of honour. I don’t support the marriage. How do I decline?


Hi reddit, long time subscriber to this sub, and today I need your help. I’m using a throwaway as I’d rather not have this linked to my main. I’d love some help navigating a situation I’m currently in. I’m sorry this post is so long.

I have a friend, we’ll call her Louise, who I’ve known for close to 30 years now. We’re the kind of friends who can go a year without speaking, and when we do nothing will have changed. 

About 14 years ago Louise got
Together with Steve. The relationship was volatile from the start, but Louise fell pregnant and they decided to try and make things work. Steve is the most selfish and entitled person I’ve ever met, a true narcissist and all round horrible human being. I’ve witnessed his emotional abuse countless times, I’ve seen him punch and kick holes into walls, throw objects at undeserving people, get into physical fights, because he can’t control his anger. According to Louise, he’s never been violent towards her, but I’m not convinced. He’s a terrible father to his son, who’s now 12, and they’ve never had a good relationship. Heartbreakingly, when their son was around 8 or 9, he told me that he wished it was just him and his mum, since he knew his father hated him.

Over the years, Louise has left Steve a few times. But she always goes back. The typical abused partner. She relies on his parents for childcare (Steve has never looked after his own son, never even changed a nappy) and his parents become very manipulative towards Louise when they’re broken up. I offered my support for many years until I just couldn’t excuse it any longer, since her choices were ultimately affecting her son, and I distanced myself about 5 years ago, only catching up once or twice a year. When I do speak to Louise now, Steve has warned her not to discuss their relationship with me, complaining that she always tries to leave him after she’s spent time with me. The last time I saw Steve, a couple of years back, was during a time that I was secretly helping Louise to leave and begin a new life with her son. She ended up taking Steve with her. They’re still together, living in a house she owns by herself.

In the last year or so she’s lost over half of her body weight. Medical tests have shown there’s nothing physically causing this, and I suspect she’s dealing with an eating disorder. 

Today I get a phone call from Louise.  She and Steve are getting married in six months, and she wants me to be her maid of honour. It hit me like a bolt out of the blue. I told her I loved her and I wanted her to be happy, but that I was not Steve’s greatest fan, and I asked why after all this time she wanted to get married. She said Steve’s changed, they are finally happy and their son is doing well and it feels like the right time. If Steve’s ‘changed’ it simply means he’s given up drink/drugs and is finally able to maintain a job and contribute financially to the family, he has certainly not had any therapy or professional help.

I pointed out that their wedding date will take place three weeks after I’m due to give birth to my first child, and I’ll need to think about whether I can realistically take on this role. 

The reality is, I hate Steve, I hate what he’s done to my friend, even more I hate the effect it’s had on their child, and I do not support this marriage in any way.

I don’t know what to do. I don’t even want to attend the wedding, never mind standing next to her whilst despising the absolute piece of shit that she’s choosing to be legally bound to. 

How do I communicate this to her? My SO says I should just blame the fact that I will have a newborn, and that only negative things can come of me telling her the truth, and I should avoid hurting her. I’m reluctant to lie in this way, but I see where he’s coming from. What should I do?


Tl;dr my oldest friend is getting married to her long term abusive asshole of a partner. Wants me to be her maid of honour. I don’t support this marriage in any way. I’ll have a three week old newborn when the wedding rolls around. How do I break the news to her that I simply can’t do this?"
25,"My [28F] boyfriend [30M] didn't buy a plane ticket for a trip we planned three months ago and just told me.


Hi. I'll try to be concise but I am just so sad. Hence the throwaway name. 

&amp;#x200B;

My boyfriend and I have a really long history, we were FWB in college, neither really wanted to commit, I graduated and moved to a nearby larger city and I ended up in a long term relationship. He moved to the same city several years later, we always stayed in touch pretty casually, and we always had a great friendship, shared humor, so much in common in interests, and always a great mutual affection. I struggle with anxiety/depression and he always seemed supportive and understanding of this, and he helped me with my overwhelming emotions and was very level. 

&amp;#x200B;

I ended up leaving my LTR in 2017, he expressed to me that he regretted never having told me in college that he had very strong feelings for me, he expressed that he wanted to try to be in a relationship. I was hesitant, just having left my LTR, and I waffled for a bit which I think hurt him inexplicably. BUT, we started dating in early 2018 and things were amazing for a while. He is spontaneous, our humors and weirdness vibe so well, I was starting to feel like it was meant to be. He is the funniest person I think I've ever met and I just love doing nothing with him. 

&amp;#x200B;

We moved in together about six months ago, had some generic 'ugh you're so messy' arguments but other than that things were okay. Then the sex life started fading a bit, and I continuously asked him and checked in what was on his mind, if I could do anything to reignite the interest, etc. I also had some conversations with him about his withdrawn behavior overall, he stopped celebrating any holidays or events for us, and when I asked about it or requested it he would say he would do better but nothing happened. 

&amp;#x200B;

It was another of these conversations, when I was trying to express that my needs for romance/attention aren't being met. These conversations are usually really one sided, with my trying to ask questions and getting very little input. So he warned me he wanted to have a talk and he offloaded several huge bombs. 

He's been having doubts for months:

* He thinks I am too negative still (Which is something we've talked about in the past regarding my anxiety/depression, but I'm really jiving with my therapist right now and I thought we were doing well.)
* He thinks I drink too much (I'll cop to this, we both drink too much, he works in the service industry and it's a bit party heavy. He acknowledged he has an issue too and in the past we've both taken 'breaks' which I am on one right now so this also seemed a bit random.)
* He doesn't think that he can handle how my emotions affect him. (This is the one that ripped my heart out, I've been ASKING him what's wrong for months and he kept saying we were okay and then I find out he's had doubts, doesn't know if he can be happy with me, but he didn't want to tell me.)

&amp;#x200B;

So we are supposed to go to a friends wedding in Chicago in March. 'We' booked the airfare in December, I booked the airbnb and we've had chats about other things we want to do while we are there. Well last night he tells me he didn't book them, because he 'wasn't sure if we'd still be together' when the date came. 

&amp;#x200B;

He says he doesn't want to break-up he is 'uncertain' of what to do. But he also laid this all out for me, showed zero emotion, and seemingly is over it. I was crying at the point he mentioned not buying a ticket to Chicago and I asked if he felt remorse and he said he's sorry it hurt me as a consequence, but he doesn't regret not going through with something he was unsure about. 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm fucking baffled. I can see he is obviously depressed but he shows very little interest in working on that overall. He is also desperate to start a family, we have talked extensively about marriage, a house, children. There was in the past zero hesitation to talk about these things, even though I would interject that we needed to be saving, focusing on our careers, etc. 

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR - My boyfriend and I have been in touch/had feelings for one another on and off for about 7 years, we finally got together and started dating and it was great for six months and then he started to get very withdrawn. Can I do anything? Does he just have grass is always greener syndrome? Things came to a head when he told me last night he only bought one ticket for a wedding we are going to in March (he bought the tickets in December) because he 'wasn't sure if we were still going to be together.'

26,"My (38M) daughter (13F) acts strangely and talks to herself


My ex (39F) and I had 3 kids together before we divorced about 7 years ago. My daughter is 13. I’ll call her Lacey. 

Lacey is now 13 years old. She appears to be behind developmentally in a few ways. She has almost no understanding of abstract subjects, no social skills, and no emotional intelligence. Both her younger and older brother far exceed her in these areas. She has been held back twice in school. She is currently getting good grades, but it isn’t really that she understands the material. She just obsessively spends hours on her homework or studying something that doesn’t take that long to do. 

My daughter talks to herself A LOT. When she was little, I was told it’s cute and she will grow out of it. She hasn’t. She has full blown conversations with herself. When we go out in public and she does this, people look at her likes she’s crazy. No matter how many times I’ve talked to her about it, she continues to do it. She hasn’t developed empathy like other kids her age have. She doesn’t care how other people think or feel and would never consider other people’s feelings. She has serious hygiene problems. I have to force her to shower and brush her teeth and hair. She gets very angry with me, but I have to stand in the bathroom door and watch her brush or else she won’t do it. If I don’t, she will go so far as to go in the bathroom for a few minutes pretending to brush and then say she has. It’s gross. I only have her half time. Her mother doesn’t enforce any cleanliness standards, and so half the time, my daughter goes out stinking with matted, greasy hair and teeth with slime on them. Lacey just doesn’t have any understanding of why it’s important to be clean although it’s been explained countless times. 

A good part of the time, Lacey just seems like a zombie. She will be almost nonverbal. You can talk to her, try to play games, tell her jokes, and she will just sit there pretty much ignoring, only shrugging or making some kind of disapproving sound. Other times, she will do pretty well (for her), but she still has these weird tics. She is obsessive about certain things and insists she has to check and organize her backpack for about 20-30 minutes before bedtime. 

She has no friends. Just a couple weeks ago, we were at a friend’s house. Two girls a little younger than her that she’s known casually for a while sat next to her and tried to chat. My daughter decided she wouldn’t stop the book she was reading, so she literally sat there staring at the book, ignoring these two girls. I saw and told her she’s read a lot and shouldn’t hurt her eyes and took the book. So she decided to pull half her hair over her face and sit there looking like Cousin It. Those girls tried talking to her for a while and eventually gave up. It was so bizarre. This is not an isolated incident. This is pretty much the norm for her in any kind of social situation. 

She also has no understanding of consequences. Her entire life, she has not once understood that she has done something wrong. If she is disciplined and everything is explained, she still comes away thinking she is being wrongfully persecuted. She honestly talks about how she never does anything bad, ever. 

Lacey is addicted to electronic devices. My ex let’s her play on her tablet for 10+ hours a day (I’m not exaggerating). So when she’s there, Lacey will watch music video for ten or so hours, only rolling out of bed to eat pizza or go to the bathroom. She won’t shower, change her clothes, brush her hair, nothing. I know this is bad and doesn’t help her at all, but I can’t do anything about it. My ex refuses to change her parenting style, and the legal system has no problems with it either. 

I’ve wanted my daughter in therapy for a while, but my ex refuses and we both have to agree to anything like that. She always just says there’s nothing wrong with Lacey. And maybe she will just grow out of this stuff? She’s been this way her whole life, and I’m concerned she’s going to fail in adulthood. I don’t really know what to do about it, but I thought maybe people who have had similar problems with their kids could offer some insight. Sorry this is so long. 

TLDR: My teen daughter acts strangely and I don’t know what to do about it. "
27,"I [32m] had a horrible experience traveling with my girlfriend [28F] of 5.5 years. Thinking of ending relationship. I really need to vent...


TL;DR: Traveling long distance with girlfriend is terrible. Every time we go somewhere it is like pulling teeth for me. 

About 6 months ago we flew to Hawaii with the free travel benefits my work provides. 10 days in Oahu. My brother lives there and we had a place to stay the entire time for free as opposed to spending thousands of dollars on a hotel. He would be at work and we wouldn’t have to worry about seeing him for most of the trip. What more could anyone ask for??  
  
With tons of things the island has to offer, I knew exactly what I wanted to do.  
  
I researched up prices of grocery store fruits and vegetables and dates/times of pop-up food markets. I researched hiking trails with waterfalls and amazing views at the top of volcanos/mountains which included average hiking times and I studied maps to a general idea of what I was getting into. I looked up spots for surfing and paddle boarding (I am an avid surfer at home). I looked up laws about camping and bonfires so that we could do some cool stuff like many people dream of doing.  
  
All of this preparation felt normal to me and I wanted to really make this a magical and adventurous time for the both of us. Months leading up to the first day of travel I repeatedly asked her what she wanted to do in Hawaii and every time she just said she didn’t know. She only vaguely looked up Hawaii while watching Sharktank and Supernatural on Hulu/Netflix. Yet, she was still very excited to go on vacation and expressed this multiple times. I encouraged her to google Hawaii and she put forth zero effort.  
  
When we get to Hawaii we go to the grocery store to get food and I get zero feedback as to what she wants to eat. As we pass by the fruit and vegetables at food markets early in the morning, I point out how cheap they are and that they all look so delicious and amazing... She doesn’t want any of that. We ended up spending hours walking around looking for gluten-free restaurants that cater to people with celiacs (gluten makes her violently ill for like 6+ straight hours and body aches for 24 hours). Walking around, looking for gluten-free food ends up taking up about 60% of every single day. This all could have been avoided if she had at least participated a little in pointing out what foods she wanted so that we could prepare healthy meals together for a fraction of the price.  
  
We went to go hiking, but she didn’t bring any hiking shoes. My brother told us to bring good hiking shoes prior to our trip because there are sharp jagged rocks everywhere and everything is muddy and slippery. It’s literally a jungle out there. She has these shitty Payless looking shoes with zero grip on the bottom, which I was willing to accept as a poor choice of hiking shoes and then says, “they give me blisters, so I’ll just go hiking in these flip flops.”  
  
Hell no! I turn the car around at the parking lot of the trail start and we drive to the city to look for shoes. Finish Line and Footlocker has shoes and she saw they were like $80 she refused to even let ME buy them because they were too expensive. She ended up getting some cheap foam looking running shoes in Walmart for $20. We went hiking, saw a waterfall, and she finally agreed that it was a good thing she didn’t go in just flip flops.  
  
We drove around looking at views around the island like Diamond Head and the North Shore, but always ended back up at Waikiki in the shopping district because that was where she believed there would be gluten-free food she could eat. One night a restaurant claiming to be gluten-free had put gluten in her food mistakenly and she spent the rest of the night vomiting/pooping into the toilet at my brother’s home.  
  
5 hours before the end of our 10 days in paradise, she said she wished we had done more and that she didn’t get to do anything she wanted to do. Not once during the trip did she express even an inkling of knowledge about things to do in Hawaii. She wished we had gone swimming with turtles, seen dolphins, seen more sunsets, camped on the beach...  WTF?!?  
  
I was livid at this point. I had led this entire vacation from start to finish. She didn’t try to take the lead or speak up about what she wanted to do or see until we were packing to leave. I withheld all signs of frustration because an argument before getting on planes for 10.5 hours is obviously not a good idea.  
  
———————-  
  
She wants to go to New Zealand, Iceland, and Greece... I can’t see myself every traveling outside of the US with her because finding gluten free food wont be easy and her refusal to assist in cooking in Hawaii (I cook well) makes for preparing our own meals a pipe dream.  
  
She wants to go on a cruise and says, “Everything is taken care of and you don’t have to worry about anything.”  
  
Being stuck on a cruise ship sounds like a nightmare to me. I can’t do that. I want to talk to the locals and experience new cultures. I don’t want to be stuck on a boat with pre-planned attractions. She also gets easily motion sick which boggles my mind as to why a cruise is something she actually wants to do.  
  
—————-  
  
Okay so... Fast forward 6 months later. That experience 6 months ago is still burned into my brain. I’ve slowly started to resent our relationship more and more as the months go by. We are totally different people and I understand that I need to accept her for who she is, but traveling is a huge part of my life. My career has reached a point where i can travel somewhere exotic every month for a week at a time and on one hand i want to bring her with me to see the world, but at the same time I don’t want her anywhere near me. Cambodia, Vietnam, Thailand, Japan, Korea, and a large portion of China... I want to go to these places, but if I bring her I know 100% that I’m going to have a bad time.  
  
I’ve tried to make the best of the relationship and enjoy life with her for the past 6 months, but I’m just sad 24/7 and I see myself becoming bitter around her. Obviously I love her and I’ve spent over 5 years of wonderful moments with her, but I’m just not enjoying life anymore. I thought maybe if I just try my hardest to commit to the relationship and set our differences aside that my feelings were just temporary and a common issue that can be worked out, but I feel like I am at the end of my rope.  
  
2 of my coworkers and I have made plans to spend 3 weeks traveling through Asia next month. They are of the same mindset as myself and have the same exact interests as me. I think in a week I’m going to have to end our relationship. When I picture in my head the idea of sharing new experiences with someone I love and traveling the world, I don’t see it being with her. It pains me to think like this, but I don’t know what else I can do."
28,"I [24/M] bought my dream car this past weekend and my girlfriend [21/F] won’t stop complaining about it, says that it is jeopardizing our relationship


Since I was 17 I’ve had a Corvette, but I have been looking for a larger car for awhile. Friday I was at the supermarket and in the lot I saw a beautiful 69 Lincoln Continental with a for sale sign on it. I called the number, got to look at the car right then and there, had my brother in law (mechanic) come out to look at it and bought it. I couldn’t be happier, this is my dream car. My girlfriend of 1 year was away for the weekend and when she came back Sunday night and saw it she freaked out, called it impractical and humiliating to which I responded that it’s practical for me and I’m proud of it.  I thought she would cool off and she hasn’t 

She’s in college and I’ve been driving her to class since her apartment and the university are on my way to work and she broke her leg in January and can’t drive. On Monday she told me to drop her off around the corner because she didn’t want to be seen getting out of this car, I told her that I’m not a chauffeur and that if she’s embarrassed of me she can get a taxi, and I dropped her off right in front of the college. She got an Uber on Tuesday and Wednesday and it’s all I’ve heard about, how I’m making her take a taxi to school because of my ridiculous car, and just now we were on the phone and she said that it’s not just my car, that my style and my music (I’m a guitarist in a band) is stuck in the past and is jeopardizing our relationship.


I love her, at least I think I love her, but I don’t know what to do. I am who I am and I like what I like, a car and my style is a stupid reason to end a relationship, but I want to be loved for who I am. That doesn’t me she has to like everything I like but having the car that I want doesn’t hurt anyone so I don’t understand why it should bother her. What do I do guys?


**TL;DR:** I got my dream car and my girlfriend is angry and says that it is jeopardizing our relationship."
29,"I [25M] Fell asleep at a party and a girl stopped me being abused.


Recently, I went to a party and I was very tired as I had been working earlier today. I went into one of the bedrooms and fell asleep and apparently. Supposedly one of the drunk girl's came into the room and started feeling me up while I was asleep. And so another woman who I am very grateful to, got a chair and sat outside the room to stop anyone bothering me.

It has been about a week since then and I have seen the girl (the one who protected me not tried to feel me up) around but I have been too shy to approach her and thank her. Any advice please?

TL;DR Girl protected me while I was asleep at a party. I would like to thank her but I have been too nervous/shy so far."
30,"Me [23M] and my GF[21F] of 1 year, I see a future with her, but her telling me not to worry about her six figure student loan debt is concerning.


I know based on the title I probably seem like an asshole, and if that's the truth then tell me, I just ask that you read all of my post before replying. Part of the reason why I'm even making this post is that I feel like i may be an asshole because of this. I want to preface this post by saying that I very much love my girlfriend and I could see myself staying with her long term, but I keep having anxiety about her financial situation. I know that I'm probably jumping the gun and that one year is very early into a relationship, but I can't help but plan ahead. We started dating about a year ago and we hit it off really well. I'm about to graduate in December and I'll be starting my first non-internship job, and she will have one more year of school before graduating. About two months ago I learned the approximate amount (100k-120k) of student loans that she has. I knew that she had loans, but was shocked that it was such a large amount. I'll be graduating with less than 15k of debt due to scholarships and saving money from internships and jobs.

&amp;#x200B;

I was expecting a  much more average amount like 50k or less, because unless I'm mistaken that amount of debt is typical for law school or medical school, and she is pursuing a standard 4 year degree. On top of the debt, her desired field has a very low average income (40k and under for our high cost of living area) she has next to no savings, and it is very hard to find a job in her field. I've already accepted a job in our area since it was at one of the top companies in my field and would springboard my career, so moving somewhere else isn't a very viable option. I'll be making an above average salary, but not high enough that this debt isn't extremely worrisome for me. 

&amp;#x200B;

She said that her father said he would help her pay the loan since he cosigned it but if I'm being honest I don't believe him when he says that. He's an abusive deadbeat who is terrible with money and makes horrible financial decisions. Part of the reason why this is a bad loan is that he decided that he knew what was best and got a loan with an abnormally higher interest rate, instead of listening to people who know more about this than he does. I'm receiving a finance degree, I've worked in financial services and will continue to work in that area when I start my job, and I've been telling him to look into refinancing, but he is too stubborn. My girlfriend can tell that I'm worried about it and tells me not to think about money so much, but it's literally going to be my job to think about money and financial planning in a few months. We were talking last week about when we'd start to consider marriage, and I said that I wouldn't want to get married until her debt situation was a little more under control, meaning she has a steady job and has been making payments for at least a few years. 

&amp;#x200B;

I talked to my parents about my concerns and they said they were extremely disappointed in me. I told them that financial stress is one of the top reasons why relationships end and their response was that if I break up with my girlfriend over this, then I never really loved her. My father went on to say that if my mother had that much debt when he met her, that he wouldn't have let it get in the way. I didn't really think it was fair of him to make this judgment considering that he didn't have to make this decision and my parents are in an extremely secure financial position at this point in their lives. Both my parents graduated from school debt free and will be retiring within 10 years with plenty of savings. I'm aware that money isn't everything, but in the world we live in, it is important. Money problems put stress on both people in a relationship and that puts stress on a relationship. I'm worried that if I stay with my girlfriend long term and things progress past dating, the added stress from taking on this debt could cause me to resent her.

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR The combination of my girlfriend's six figure debt and low paying field have me worried about future stress it could put on our relationship."

Wanted to start off by saying thank you to everyone who gave me very helpful advice when I posted the first time. Really, truly, thank you. I felt so supported and so validated, and very much so wished I could show the thread to my bosses.

About a week ago, I confronted my boss who was the one in the car laughing at me. It took me literally months to work up the courage, since this kind of conflict (asking for a need/to feel safe) is really hard for me. This is how it went down:

*B****oss comes in to tell me things before leaving***

**Me (before she leaves, putting my work down for a second): ""Hey, um, can I ask a favor?""**

**Her: ""Yeah?""**

**Me: ""Can \[driver who swerved car at me\] not come around while I'm here any more?""**

**Her, serious: ""Why, did he do something?""**

**Me: ""A while ago, he swerved his car at me, and everyone laughed, and I'm kind of not over that.""**

**Her, blunt: ""...Okay.""** ***leaves, slamming the door on her way out***

That was my Friday. The day before I came back to work, my bosses texted me saying we would be having a team meeting the morning I returned to the office.

During the meeting, I was told explicitly by both bosses (it was a bit of back-and-forth between the two, but this is the gist of what they both laid on me) :

**""You do not get to ask people to not come here. You will be respectful to our guests. When they're here, they're not just hanging out, they're working(\*). And they work without getting paid.""**

\*They do a lot of minor handy-man projects like building shelves, painting, minor plumbing, and sometimes hand-writing out some of our documents. They've done some food runs for my boss as well.

**Me: ""But** ***he swerved his car at me***\*\*. It's a\*\* ***car***\*\*, I thought I was going to die! A car isn't a toy!""\*\*

**""That's just his normal, I mean, we \[bosses are sisters\] drive by each other all the time, flip each other off, scream** ***Fuck You*** **in the street. That's how \[driver\] grew up, that's totally normal for him. If** ***you*** **feel uncomfortable around him, then** ***you*** **can leave.""**

I was not allowed to speak. I was not allowed to share my piece. My bosses were so aggressively back-and-forth that I felt teamed up against, and that I was being attacked. By the end of the meeting I had my head bent, and was shaking and crying. I lost the ability to speak after being verbally shut down.

I know a lot of you are going to say 'You need to quit your job and find somewhere else'--and yeah, if this was any other company I probably would have quit on the spot. I'm so depressed right now and dread every day I have to go in; but really, I'm not good at anything else. It's a small business and it's something I'm actually *really good* at; other people who have come in compliment my work: ""Wow, this is a professional product!"" ""That's beautiful!"" ""Our clients really love you and the work that you do"" ""We know you're really good at this so we're handing this project off to you, you do such a great job"". I get to lock myself in a room and just work alone for hours at a time, which I really need.

Also, since I posted last, I started seeing a therapist. Since this incident (the team meeting), I started seeing her twice a week. She thinks that the work is good for me: she can see how happy the work itself makes me, how it fulfills a part of my life. She also thinks that my bosses are toxic people who clearly trigger me, and she also believes they have some sort of boundary issues and/or personality disorders. She supports me cutting my hours and potentially applying for disability for my mental health problems.

Thank you for reading, I hope everyone is doing okay today &lt;3

Tl;Dr - A few months ago, my boss' in-law swerved his car at me as I was crossing the street. Last week, I asked that he not be allowed at the office any more because I was still hurting over it. I was sat down in a team meeting and told I'm not allowed to ask things like that, and if the in-law is at the office, then I am the one who needs to leave. I'm now seeing a therapist twice a week and she thinks my work environment is toxic. "
32,"I'm (F20) living off food stamps while my partner (M29) gets to spend without much worry. We live together.


Hi everyone. I will start off by saying that I hold a full time job and take any hours I get. My partner has a full time job that pays him well over twice as much as I make, and he gets regular handouts from his parents. 

Everything I earn goes towards paying my share of our rent. What little may be leftover is used for public transportation and necessities. I have no money left for food and therefore rely entirely on food stamps to eat. I want to save money, but I can't. I'm getting nowhere and I know my living situation is unsustainable. 

My partner, however, enjoys his comfortable life in the city with a somewhat spacious apartment. He isn't rich but can spend several hundred at a time if he wants. He convinced me to move somewhere larger than I was prepared to because he sincerely thought I would be fine. He, after all, was fine when he moved out at 18. But he also had many roommates and rent was significantly cheaper. I should have been smarter about moving, but I was 18 at the time and had no real idea how much living on my own would actually cost. I also trusted him that we would work things out between us financially. 

I don't blame him for my position but as you might imagine it's causing me distress when I often skip meals to have enough food in a month while he is perfectly fine. I have talked to him about it before but he thinks I should start taking out loans and go from there. I don't want to live in debt. 

My ideal situation would be either him paying more for our rent so I can begin to save, us moving into a smaller place here, or a cheaper place in the subarbs. He does not want to change his current lifestyle. 

TL;DR My partner of 3 years is well off while I'm working for rent and struggling for food, all while we live under the same roof. What should I do? "
33,"I[21M] feel more like my girlfriend's[21F] caretaker than her SO


FYI, we're both in college and live on campus.

Our morning routine consists of me getting up, showering, and going back to our room to find her still laying there. She's usually awake, just looking at her phone. As soon as I enter the room, she asks me to do all these things for her to help her get ready for the day (i.e. getting her a glass of water, feeding our bunny, making her coffee, putting one of her Netflix shows on, etc). So when I'm putting gel in my hair or putting clothes on she expects me to juggle her responsibilities as well. It's very stressful to repeatedly drop what I'm doing at a given moment to cater to her while she's scrolling through Instagram.

This happens throughout the day as well, one time she wanted me to walk her back from a friends house at night when I was already in my pj's. This seems completely reasonable considering she's an attractive woman on a college campus, but this friends house is actually no further than 20 yards from ours in a well-lit and safe area. I can watch her entire 10 second walk from my window. I ended up not walking her and that started an argument when she arrived.

Individually, these things aren't that big of a deal but this happens every day and I'm starting to feel more like her caretaker than her SO. She's fully capable of getting herself up in the morning and it would help me out since I have many things to do before I can leave class. I guess I just want her to take those matters into her own hands instead of relying on me to do them.

Anyways, it's been stressing me out over time and this morning I finally brought it up which caused her to storm out of the house. Am I in the wrong for this? Where do I go from here?

TL;DR - My GF asks me to do many things for her that I believe she should be doing herself"
34,"My aunt’s boyfriend [50sM] weirds me [23F] out and I’m not sure if I’m overreacting


For background, my aunt [50sF] started dating a guy she had gone to high school with [50sM] “Jim” when I was still in high school.

When I was about 16, he took my aunt, me, my cousin [14M], and my sister [13F] on a ski trip. I thought he was fine and we were all getting along well, teasing and bantering, but one night on the trip my aunt pulled me aside and said that Jim didn’t think I liked him, and implied that I should be nicer. 

Flash forward to when I was 18 and was home for break after my freshman year of college. Jim texted me and asked if I wanted to get lunch. Assuming my aunt would be there, and I agreed. 

I was surprised when he pulled up to my parents house alone, but he said that my aunt couldn’t make it. I shrugged it off and went along with it. We went to a local restaurant and he ordered a beer with his meal, which I didn’t think much of. But then he had several more beers, and all of the sudden he asked me about my dating life. I had been (and still am) perpetually single, so I told him there wasn’t much to speak of.

He then proceeded to ask me why I was single, to which I shrugged. He then began to tell me how intelligent, beautiful, and funny I was. I didn’t know what to do, so I shrugged again, or maybe said thank you. Then, out of nowhere, he proceeded to say: “I mean, don’t you have needs?”

At this point I was extremely uncomfortable, and I think I just laughed it off, or shook my head. 

Much of the rest of the conversation I’ve repressed because I was embarrassed and honestly a little afraid. He went on to talk about how he wanted to propose to my aunt and how much he loved her, which I honestly considered a bit of a relief.

We then left, I offered to drive because he had had a couple (more like several) drinks, but he waved me off. 

Instead of driving me home, though, he drove me to a nearby hotel which he said had a jewelry store inside. I hesitated in the parking lot, fears spinning in my mind. Seeing my face, he laughed, almost accusingly “We’re just going to look at jewelry. What could you possibly be thinking right now?”

At this point I was almost ready to call my mom, but thankfully the jewelry store was closed, so he drove me home. 

For a long time I wrote this off as me overreacting (I must be misremembering, I probably was reading too much into it, etc.), but part of me always felt something was off. 

I’ve slowly told different family members over the years (my mom, my sister, my cousin), but never my aunt (his girlfriend.)

Most people are kind of shocked, but mostly waved it off as just a weird occurrence. He never did get to propose, and actually did some jail time for drinking and driving. 

Fast forward to recently, and he has recently been released from jail and is back living with my aunt. He will semi-frequently text me, referring to me as “Big Cat” and tried to get me to join a curling league with my aunts and him.

I still feel uncomfortable around him, so I pulled my other aunt, also 50sF, aside and explained to her why I would continue to attend large family gatherings, but I would not be joining the curling league.

She said that now that he’s sober (he’s been in AA and successfully clean for about a year), things are likely different now, and that I should consider “making amends”, of course with her or another adult present if it would make it more comfortable. 

Am I in a position where I should look to mend this relationship? Or should I just avoid spending any more time with him then absolutely necessary? Do I owe it to my aunt to tell her why I’m uncomfortable around him?

TLDR; Aunt’s boyfriend [50sM] used to be an alcoholic, and made me uncomfortable when I was 18. Should I look to make amends?

"
35,"my [16m] sister [17f] is maybe going too far with her party lifestyle? should I tell our parents?


so my sister has partying pretty hard for a few months now, I think, I don't know how or when but I think she started hanging with maybe new friends or something and has been more active in parties lately

I have nothing against partying hard, but its definitely not my style so sometimes when she tells i can drop by the party if I want i dont feel like I really want to, but on saturday I asked her if maybe if I could bring some things to the party I could bring my girlfriend too, and she said it was OK after talking to the girl who had the reunion

so we got there, I had like, 4 beers which is way too much for me, my girlfriend had like two, we talked and danced a bit and she left early, after that my sister took me to a room with some of her friends and they were doing weed, drinking and had some pills they were passing around by kissing each other.

I think she was definitely drugged before she got there because she was not acting like herself, saying she loved me and maybe we should ""share"" a pill too. They all started saying i had to have one if I was going to stay so I just got up and left and they mocked me but whatever

I hadnt seen my sister like that ever, honestly it was kind of scary she was acting extremely hyper and laughing loudly in a strange way. this was the first I saw her ""in action"" but she's posting a lot in social media about being high, drunk, whatever. I jsut checked and there's been at least one of those posts a week on her Insta for the past 7 weeks, and otehrs before

So, I dont know if am medling with her life by saying this but, I dont think thats good for her, like, in any way, I mean im sure shes having fun but should she be doing these things? should I... tell our parents? would it help or would it only make things worst? If it made it worst, should i talk to her, what would i say and would it do anything good?

Am i being a busybody for even being concerned or am i like justified in my worrying?

**tl;dr:** Sister is going a little too crazy with partying drugs and booze I think. Is what she doing bad for her or is it Ok and Im just exaggerating? should i tell our parents or maybe talk to her myself?"
36,"I (35m) Think my wife (29f) is trying to, or has slept with my father (63M).


So....throwaway for obvious reasons.   


This situation is fucked and I'm still processing all of this. Me and my wife have been married for 4 years and everything is seemingly going great until recently when my father came back into my life. A little background..   


I never knew my father growing up. I knew him and my mother were never together and I was told he was a trucker as a kid and that's why he was never around. I would talk to him on the phone every once and a while but I have zero memories of being with him as a child, teenager or otherwise. I had a good relationship with his parents, my grandparents though. What I know now is that he was in jail for a DUI that resulted in the death of a mother and her infant. My mother hid this from me until I was a teenager but after he had been released I found out through my grandfather before he passed away. He never attempted to make contact once he was released and I never attempted to contact him, I've kind of grown numb to it. I have never been in the same room as my father prior to recently. We talked a couple of times when I was a kid but I had never met him.   


A couple of months ago I get a email and when I open it up it's from him. It's this just huge wall of text expressing remorse for not being in my life, not trying harder once he was released and just giving me a laundry list of problems weighing on his moral compass. After emailing back and forth I invited him to visit me and my wife for a week and try to connect a little. I was nervous but excited, I was angry when I was younger but now I just want family in my life. My mother passed away when I was in my early 20's so I have had somewhat of a hole in my heart.   


Fast forward and my father has been here for a week now, we sort of hit it off but there is  awkwardness for sure. It doesn't feel like my dad, which makes sense because he is basically a stranger. However my wife and father have hit it off EXTREMELY well. I work in a factory a good distance away from our house so between my shift and commute I'm gone around 10 hours a day. My wife works freelance from home and has been staying at home with my father. They have gotten REALLY REALLY close, like weirdly close. To the point when I've pulled her aside and told her how uncomfortable I am with it but she just tells me I'm being crazy and need to be more open to him and try and connect like she has. I've expressed this isn't easy for me but she just got angry at me saying her father was abusive and a drunk and I'm lucky I have a father who cares enough to try and be in my life. This baffles me considering this is the first time in my life he has, I could of used it when I was younger.   


About halfway through the week I started to notice all this really really strange shit going on between them, I can't tell if I'm paranoid or if I'm reading to much into it but it's fucking with me. First red flag. When I was walking through the hall I peeked into the guest room there is a pair of her underwear on the floor between the mirror and bed stand. Now, my wife uses this room as a make up, wardrobe ect room so really that's not too strange but we cleaned and put everything away moving her clothes so my father could use the closet but I didnt think anything at the time. Later that night I'm sitting in the kitchen on my laptop and my father is behind me by the fridge, my wife walks in and I can see my father wink in the reflection of the screen behind me at her as she walks in. My wife's face goes beat red. The next night, I wake up and my wife isn't in bed with me so I go out into the living room and they're sitting together on the couch watching TV. When I walk in they kinda jump like I caught them off guard and my wife starts stammering out that she couldn't sleep and heard the TV so she came out and decided to watch with my father. He was just kind of looking off onto the ground not really saying much. I just said alright well I'll see you in the morning. There's been a couple other things that went on that kind of raised my suspicious but they sound too stupid to try and explain. I was just driving home from work today and it just all started to click, I was starting to put the pieces together and I can't even fucking believe what I'm thinking. Is my wife fucking my father?!   


Reddit, what the hell? What do I do? Do I confront them? Should I set up a cam when I'm at work? Does it seem like I'm reading into this way too much, am I off base? I'm sick to my stomach and so so lost with all this.  


TL;DR: Estranged father came back into my life, I invited him over to stay with me and my wife. They got VERY close. Started to notice strange things, like her underwear in guestroom, him winking at her, leaving my bed when I'm asleep to hangout with him ect. I just pieced everything together while driving today and feel like I'm going to throw up.

37,"I (22f) told my coworker (50s m) I would not speak with him, unless he took control of his temper. Worried about consequences.


I was at work yesterday, I have a desk job, and one of my coworkers, Jon, came up to me saying he'd disagreed with what I'd done on a project I'm on. I asked him to explain what he meant, and he very quickly started getting heated about it, raising his voice, even getting in my space to the point I could smell his breath. 

It really makes me panic to have a dude raise his voice at me, I have some scary shit that happened when I was a kid and honestly I have this involuntary reaction of tearing up whenever a guy gets yelly or agressive. It's embarrassing but I can't help it. I also am in therapy now, and my therapist has been trying to be comfortable with being more assertive and speaking up for myself if something feels wrong. So I tried to do that, at work yesterday.

I told Jon that I didn't care to be spoken to like that. And that we were not having this conversation until he'd managed to take control of his temper. He was trying to say that he was calm, and kept trying to start sentences. He didn't sound calm. And I didn't reply except to say several times over that he could come back at 11 am and speak to me with respect.

He walked away and I'd managed to hold off on tearing up that whole time which is new for me, I guess I didn't feel so helpless this time around.

Anyway, Jon did come back at 11 am, and wanted to meet with me in a conference room. I had a bad feeling about being alone in a room after how things had gone that morning so I said we could speak at my desk. We had a conversation about the work issue and at one point he snapped at me and raised his voice and I just went ""Would you like to continue this conversation tomorrow, so you have some time to think over your words? I will not be spoken to like that."" 

And afterwards I felt really good about having stood up for myself, but then my boss Stanley asked to talk with me. He asked me, really open ended, what had gone on with Jon this morning. I said that Jon and I had a disagreement about how I'd done a project recently. Stanley asked specifically about when I sent him away, and I said that Jon was raising his voice at me, and I don't care to be intimidated first thing Monday morning, or at any time for that matter. So I told Jon that we could continue the conversation after he had gotten control of himself. 

And my boss asked about more details, saying he'd heard a different side of things from Jon. Apparently Jon doesn't consider what he did raising his voice excessively?? I told Stanley that regardless of what Jon intended, he was coming across as angry enough, and physically intimidating enough, that I was alarmed. And that perhaps Jon should be more thoutful of of the tone he uses, and of people's personal space.

My boss didn't say much to that, and we ended the conversation there.

Today, I'm feeling very anxious that I went too far. I honestly can't tell if it's just me having bad conflicted feelings over having stood up for myself... That's happened before. Or if I screwed up. I won't be able to see my therapist till next week, and I am stressed.

Can I have some advice? If I screwed up, is there any kind of damage control I can do? Or did I even screw up?

tl;dr I told my coworker that I would not speak to him if he raised my voice to me, and we could speak later if he could control himself. My boss called me in to tell him what happened. I'm stressed!

38,"I'm [30 F] raising my brother [16 M] and he is making it impossible for me to date due to him throwing fits. I absolutely adore my boyfriend [33 M] of several months and don't know what to do.


**Background:**

Ive had my brother (I am a guardian, he is not adopted) since he was 12. He has ADHD and is on meds. Our mom died a decade ago, our dad 4 years ago. Had my other brother (17) for a year and had to remove him from home a couple years ago. I lost my job as a successful engineer during that time and had to take a lower paying, less stressful position to accommodate my brother. Our grandma died earlier this month. I divorced my ex husband about a year ago. A lot of churn and hardship. I also am in weekly counseling.

**Things I am doing, have tried, or looked into in regards to my brother:**

* He is in monthly counseling and has been for nearly 4 years with same psychologist. He mostly refuses to talk.
* He sees a psychiatrist every 3 months for ADHD.
* We spend at least one night a week together, family movie night every week, and sometimes two or three just doing brother sister stuff and I make sure I spend quality time with him. He is not neglected and dominates most my time these days.
* Looked into boarding and/or military schools, applied to dozens, we cannot afford them and he was not accepted at the couple we could afford. This is not an option but many people suggest it like it is. I spent months vetting it, sadly it is not.
* Giving up guardianship, but the state will not allow this. They do not want kids in the system and its near impossible to achieve this.
* Currently having him research emancipation but he is unlikely to meet the requirements for it.
* Reached out to all extended family. My other brother lives with a step aunt and there is no one but me to care for my brother. I have exhausted every avenue.
* Have called the police on him and gotten him arrested for property damage once. 

**Current:**

I have recently started seriously dating (about 2 months now committed) a guy who I am really falling for. He is amazing. He is unlike any other guy I have ever met and makes me extremely happy for the first time in so many years I can't even remember. He is kind and understanding. He has made a lot of effort to work with me raising my brother. He spends time trying to find ways to engage with my brother and has made a lot of efforts towards including him where we can.

We work opposite schedules so seeing each other isn't easy, often we only have an hour here or there or one of us misses sleep on the weekend. So we value our time together.

Its getting to the point though my brother is making it a very serious issue. I either have to miss sleep to see him because I can't have him at my house or I don't get to see him.

I'm really sad, I see this going somewhere and I don't want to lose that chance because my brother I am trying to raise is a total jerk.

**Brother's behavioral issues:**

* He has always been disrespectful towards me, it got much worse after my ex husband moved out. I am regularly called awful names I cannot repeat here and told to eff off whenever he doesn't get what he wants. 
* He will scream, blast music, slam things, and be unbearable for hours at a time when he doesn't get what he wants or I have someone at my house. Recently he has started doing this middle of the night so I cannot sleep because he is mad I see my boyfriend for an hour or so after he, my brother, is supposed to be in bed anyway. (I should note we are not intimate in my house, my boyfriend isn't comfortable with it and my brother would make it impossible anyway so we just want to sit on the couch and talk or watch something, thats it)
* He will not leave me alone when I have company. Most the time he will be in his room when Im home with just him but soon as I have someone over (within minutes), which is my boyfriend now days, he has to follow us around, be a foot from us blasting stuff from his phone, cussing at me, or making noises. If I go in my room he will stand in hallway and do it until the person has enough and leaves. My boyfriend has tried ignoring him with me for over and hour and we've both given up because ignoring him doesn't work, he just gets more and more intense. Its unbearable.
* In public my brother will say derogatory things, I cannot take him anywhere with my boyfriend and frankly I dont like taking him anywhere with just me these days either. I don't feel safe. He says racial slurs and stuff that is very possibly going to get himself and/or me killed.

I have no idea what to do. I limit wifi and try enforcing consequences, have gotten him arrested (which was just a nightmare for me really) but he will act out so much it will impact my ability to work (I can't do my job very well on little sleep). I also have bipolar and this is causing me major mental health problems and Im getting super worried about myself. His school is a nightmare, I have a behavior plan set up and a support team but they are unable to handle him well right now and he is super behind.

I essentially I have to stick this out until he is 18. I am at wits end but there doesn't seem to be another option.

Does anyone have any advice? I'd really like to keep seeing my boyfriend because it feels like it could be a very healthy longterm thing for me and Im so happy with him. But I don't know how to handle my brother and make that possible. 

**TL;DR: Raising my 16 year old brother. Have exhausted all other options for him. He is in therapy. No family who can take him. No ability to afford boarding or military school. He acts out intensely with no respect and is making it impossible for me to date and I dont feel safe in public with him either with what he mouths off. How to handle this?**"
39,"My (22f) boyfriend (23m) has very unrealistic goals for our future.


My boyfriend and I had very different upbringings. He grew up in a house hold with 5 siblings. His parents have a good sized age gap. His family has always done well financially. I grew up with 2 siblings and my parents have always struggled financially. My parents are the same age.

My boyfriend and I often talk about long term goals. We are both interested in marriage and having a family. He wants to have 6 kids. I only want 2-3. I only want that amount because I know he and I won’t be starting a family any time soon. I don’t anticipate us being married and having kids till late 20s/30s. I think having 6 kids given we will start late is very unrealistic given we have no good sized age gap and biology very much impacts pregnancy.

I don’t think he understands how taxing and hard it is to bear children. He even suggested adopting to fill the quota and I’m not interested in adoption. It’s still a lot of work raising 6 kids. It seems like for him he just wants this set up by any means necessary, but he also talks about how he wants to retire early. I pose the question “with what resources?” How are you going to support these so called 6 kids you want to have but retire in your 30s/40s and I’m supposed to stay at home and take care of them all?

Isn’t this ridiculously unrealistic? 

TDLR: My (22f) boyfriend (23m) has very unrealistic goals for our future. He wants to have 6 kids."
40,"I [28F] quit my previous job to get away from a crazy coworker [50'sF] and now, 9 months later, she's a client at my new job.


My ex-coworker is a very attractive, extremely charismatic, but downright horrible human being. She always has to have a target/scapegoat or else she can't seem to function. Before I was her target, she bullied the hell out of 2 different ex-coworkers until they were both fired. Once I realized I was the new target, I immediately started looking for a new job because she had management wrapped around her finger and I knew it was only a matter of time. 

I managed to get away from her eventually, but by the time I left, she had ruined my reputation at my old job and caused a lot of emotional damage. Regardless, I've been going to therapy and really enjoying my new job. My new coworkers are fantastic. 

I've blocked her on all social media and made sure not to update anything with the location of my new job. I made sure not to tell anyone at my previous job where my new job is out of fear that they would tell her. I really don't want her to know because I'm afraid she'll go out of her way to sabotage my new job (which she did to one of her other targets previously). I even go by a different name at my new job, however, most of my coworkers know my real name.

I haven't thought about her in months, but on Friday, my boss pointed out that my old employer is going to be our client on this coming Thursday. They will be working at our location for the whole day. My new boss just pointed it out as a fun coincidence, but my new boss has no idea that I've been actively avoiding ex-coworker and assumes I left on good terms. 

I desperately don't want to accidentally run into ex-coworker on Thursday and I'm afraid someone might mention that I am now working for my new employer. I want to call in sick for that day but if they end up being our client more often, I'm afraid someone will notice that I'm absent every time they are around. I am afraid to talk to my new boss about the situation because it sounds super paranoid and crazy and I don't want to ruin my reputation at my new job. What do I do??

TL;DR: I managed to escape my crazy, abusive ex-coworker by getting a new job. I have worked hard to prevent her from knowing my new place of employment, but I just found out that she will be our client later this week and I don't know how to handle the situation."
41,"I [33F] am not really physically attracted to my [35M] husband. He said he doesnt feel desired.


I am very happy in our marriage.

Last night we had some extra time to talk and he mentioned that I dont make him feel sexually attractive or desired. Not just sex, he says I don’t initiate affection enough. This was hard to get out of him, he tends to speak in vauge terms and gets clammy around the issue of sex.

I think my husband is cute, but I have never found him sexy. We have been a couple for 4 years. He actually weighs 10-20lbs less than when we first met, so it isnt a case of his appearance changing over time. For context we are both overweight, and right now I have extra weight after having a baby. I would say we are of comparable physical attractiveness, but I am more into grooming myself and making an effort to appear as attractive as possible. 

In my single days I did have relationships and flings with some coventially attractive slim and fit men. A few I found very sexy, and was aroused by touching and seeing them. Those relationships obviously had serious flaws because I did not marry them. When I met my husband the emotional connection and the compatability were incredible, and by that point I had deemed physical attractiveness a low priority in finding a mate. I don’t have any regrets.

I have had the most orgasms with him than any other partner, I think because we share such love and connection. Sex is a tricky issue with us right now, he wants it more often but clams up if I try to talk about it. I am interested in spicing things up, talking about how different positions and what work for us, talking about what was good about what we did in bed. He basically shuts down when I bring up the subject.

He is obviously insecure, but I don’t want to lie to him. I do nag him sometimes about exercise and grooming, but I really try to keep it in check. The exercise is really for health, I want us to grow old together and be able to do physical activities we enjoy well into our retirement. The grooming, yes he looks better if he shaves, but I also want him to be successful at work. He has an office job, of course appearances arent everything but a neck beard might give a bad impression. So, he isnt very into physical self care or grooming- if he was it might help my attraction, and I think it would also help him in life.

What do I say to him? I am not very sexually attracted to him. I don’t know if I can give him that feeling he says is missing for him. Have I been very unfair in agreeing to marry someone I am not very physically attracted to? Thank you.

TLDR: Husband told me he doesnt feel attractive. I honestly I am not very physically attracted to him."
42,"Partner's (40M) asking me (34M) to move out while his parents (60sM/F) are in town


We're in a 7-year relationship and live together. Partner's family lives abroad and he barely ever sees them. They weren't on particularly friendly terms until partner's sister (35F) was diagnosed with ovarian cancer in January last year. Since then, both the siblings and the parents have been talking a lot more frequently.

Due to the rekindled relationship, partner's parents are now planning to come visit their son. Problem is, he's not out to them, so they're unfamiliar with our relationship. They believe he lives alone. I assumed partner would tell before the visit, but apparently he doesn't want to go there because they're ""too old and traditional to understand"". Instead, he asked me if I could stay with a friend (31F) during that week.

We're having a fall out over this. His argument is that they'll only be staying for a week, week and a half tops, and this will be their only visit in a long while. He doesn't want to spend it fighting or explaining homosexuality to them. However, he could've already gone through that process? They've been in contact for a whole year, he's had plenty of opportunities to break the news to his parents.

I'm not sure if I'm in the wrong here? Not that I think it's fine to push anyone out of the closet at any age, but given that we're out in every other sphere of life, it seems ridiculous that I'd have to move out of my own home over this. I've asked him to at least tell them we're roommates, but he doesn't even want to compromise in such a way because ""he's a bad liar"".

*TL;DR: Partner wants me to move out of our apartment during his parents' visit because they're unaware of our relationship, and he doesn't want to come out to them. I'm kind of baffled and don't know how to feel about this.*"
43,"My (24f) boyfriend (30m) of 4 years and I got into a bizarre argument about who drank all the milk, and told me never to disagree with him in front of a guest (which happened in front of a friend).


My boyfriend and I had the weirdest and most awkward, at least on my end, argument in our entire relationship. I'm not really sure where to go from here, and I've felt uncomfortable all through the weekend. 


This past Friday night a mutual friend who lives in the same apartment complex as we do stopped by our place to hang out and play some card games. This friend mentioned that he had recently gone to the abc store and had vodka and kahlua in his car, and if we had milk we could make white Russians. I was positive we had milk because I had recently bought a gallon a few days prior and didn't think it would be empty. My boyfriend drinks a lot more milk than I do, and I typically only use a little for cereal in the morning. The last time I had grabbed the milk it had a little less than half in it. Our mutual friend came back inside with the liquor, and I went to grab a few glasses and then grab the milk. When I grabbed the gallon of milk from the back of the fridge, I was surprised that it was practically empty, there was probably less than a quarter cup left in the container. At this point my boyfriend got mad, and blamed me for drinking all of the milk. I denied it and told him I only used that milk a few times for cereal, and the last time I had my hands on it, it was around half full/empty, so he must have drank more than he remembered. He got even more angry, our friend started to get a little uncomfortable and said he didn't mind walking over to the convenient store across the street to grab some. Our friend left briefly, and while he was gone my boyfriend got extremely angry about the situation. He was yelling at me to never disagree with him in front of a guest again. He kept saying that I was the reason we were out of milk and that I drank it all. I tried to explain to him again that I drink very little milk, and he knows this, he enjoys drinking it by itself more than I do. It was more likely he finished it, and ultimately it didn't matter because we live close to both a grocery store and convenient store anyway. Our guest returned from the store, and I went to make the drinks. Things seemed calm for a bit. Then there was another mention about the missing milk from my boyfriend. I could see our guest started to feel a little awkward again, and I tried to joke by saying ""ha, maybe the cat drank it all!?"" This seemed to set my boyfriend off again, and exclaimed again, this time in front of our friend - that I should never disagree with him in front of a guest and to admit that I drank all the milk. At this point I just wanted to move past the damn milk conversation because it was so god damn stupid. So, he wanted me to admit that I drank it all and to apologize to our guest. I thought we could just move on with our lives if we did this. So, fine, I admitted (lied) that I drank all the milk and was sorry. Boyfriend seemed happy enough and we went on to play cards and it was mostly normal. Except for a 'joke' about the empty milk container every 20-30 min from him while we were playing. I didn't want to set him off again with a guest, so I just went with it. It sucked, I felt like shit and I could tell it was making our guest feel uncomfortable and awkward. I also got the impression our mutual friend wanted to stay longer and didn't just leave because he seemed genuinely worried about me. 


We have had more arguments than usual lately, but they were at least about sensical things like utility bills and chores. For example, I make more than my boyfriend, so when we moved in together we agreed that we would split the rent 50/50, but I would take on the additional cost of the utility bills and buy most of the groceries. However, over the fall/winter I've been arguing with him about his use of the heating and AC. We live in the south, and the temperatures fluctuate a lot here, even in the winter. It's not unusual for one week to be in the 70s, and then next week be in 30s/40s during seasonal transition times. This means that our AC and heating use can be weird. My boyfriend has been changing the thermostat to unreasonable levels and also keeping the heat or ac on at these extreme levels when no one is home. When he's cold he'll turn up the heat to 75-77, which is crazy hot to me even when it's snowing outside. When it starts to warm up, he'll change the thermostat to something like 63-65, which again, I think is crazy. It feels like the arctic when the AC is that low. I end up either freezing my ass off, or sweating profusely in my home since he's been controlling the thermostat. I've asked him to help me pay the increase cost in the bill each month, but he always just brings up that we agreed I would pay for it all. I've tried to get him to change his habits, he claims he'll do better but never does. I've tried to get him to turn the ac or heat at a normal level when no one is home, and he doesn't do that either. 


The other topic we argue about is usually chores and cleanliness. While neither of us have ever been neat freaks, our apartment has never been what I would consider to be filthy until recently. He has started to leave half empty food containers around the apartment. I'll find a bag of fast food that still has some burger and fries in it under a table. Sometimes these bags of food have definitely been sitting there for over a day before I find them. I'll also frequently find patches of dried food or condiment smeared on some surface, it will be dried and sometimes really hard to clean. Most recently, he had spilled a stout beer on the kitchen counter. The beer had dried on the kitchen counter, to the point where it was no longer liquid but instead a really sticky goo-like mess that took a decent amount of elbow grease and soap to clean. I'll ask him to the clean this up when I see it, but he always says ""I'll get it in a min"" or ""I'll do it after this show/save point/etc."" But he never does, and I don't want the apartment crawling with bugs so I have to do it. I know some commenters may suggest I leave the mess until he cleans it up, but unfortunately I can't really let that happen. I have a mild allergic reaction to cockroaches that triggers my asthma as well as nasal issues. It's always been important to me to ensure there is no loose food in the house and everything is sealed up tight. Boyfriend is well aware of my asthma and allergies, and what triggers them. 


Anyway, I'm not really sure how to handle this new argument. At least arguing about the thermostat and cleaning, makes sense and it's been more frustrating and hasn't gotten totally overwhelming yet. However, the argument about milk... it's too bizarre. I've tried to lightly bring it up, I told him it wasn't cool for him to say something like ""don't ever disagree with me in front of a guest"" and that it was demeaning and embarrassing, as well as made our friend extremely uncomfortable. And he's only doubled down and blames me for the milk incident. 


Do I just let this go? Or is this too weird and f'ed up to look the other way? Or does this milk argument have something to do with the other things we have been arguing about recently? I'm not sure what to think and would like to hear ides of possible resolutions. 


**tl;dr** : Boyfriend and I got into a weird argument about who drink the last of the milk in front of a friend. Boyfriend eventually said I should never disagree with him in front of a guest. Guest felt awkward. After we got new milk from the store, boyfriend kept bringing up the milk incident which made me feel weird and embarrassed. Previous to this argument, we had an uptick in normal arguments about chores and bills. "
44,"My Girlfriend [44F] and I [34M] are supposed to move in a new home in 4 weeks. I am realizing I don't want to go through with it but it will absolutely crush her if I don't. I don't know what to do.


I'll try to keep this as brief as possible, but there's a lot of details that I feel are important to explain my current situation.

My girlfriend and I first got together a little over 2 years ago. We were both coming out of bad marriages and we connected quickly and had a real no passion for each other. About 6 months into the relationship my lease was ending and we decided to live together. However, that ended up not being a great decision. She was angry a lot of the time, she would seem to be upset out of nowhere, scream, throw things, etc. I was scared but tried to stick it out, make it work. We continued to have a lot of fights and I decided to move out. I should note that she has 2 kids and I have 1. 

When I moved out I figured that would be the end of it and I started planning on how to move on. She kept calling me over the first couple weeks and I eventually would start talking to her again. She told me how much she loved me (I love her too) and that she would do what it takes to make it work. So, I decided to give it a try with us living a part.

Things were going pretty well, we both seemed to be adapting to each other more and I was feeling good about the relationship. One day, about a year later, she lost her job and decided to look for a new job closer to where I live (we live about 1.5 hours apart). She mentioned she would be willing to move her and her kids to where I live if I wanted to live with her again. I said I did (I actually surprised myself with that response) and we both were pretty excited about the idea. We found a new development and decided to build a new house for our new life together. It was exciting and I felt very happy about it.

Then, about 2.5 months ago, things started showing up again. She was getting incredibly upset at almost nothing, and it was making me really uncomfortable. I spoke to her about it and she said it was just the stress of moving and asked me to give her some slack. So I did, for awhile. However, it kept happening and getting worse. To add to my concern, her kids really do not want to live with me and my kid, and she refuses to talk to them about how they're treating us. I don't care so much about me, but my kid is only 6 and doesn't understand why they treat us badly. My kid loves them anyway, which is heartbreaking to me.

There was a big blow up about 4 weeks back and since then I've started having the feeling I should get away. A feeling I can't shake at all. I've lost all excitement for the house and all I really want is to leave the situation. I started thinking about how much relief I felt when I left the first time and why that was. I started thinking about how I didn't want to move my kid into there home again and move back out again. As each day comes I know I don't want to do this.

However, how can I possibly back out? She's moving her whole family here assuming she'll have me with her, help support her, help split the cost of the home. We ordered furniture, we keep visiting the house, she's incredibly excited. I should also note, she truly loves me deeply, which makes it hurt even more that I want to leave. My ex-wife didn't love me and I could feel it, but my girlfriend does. And I don't want to devaste her like this. She will be crushed, she will be insanely angry, and she will be left all alone to deal with everything. 

I can't move in..but I can't do this to her. I'm having panic attacks, I'm severely depressed, and I feel trapped. I feel like the worst person in the world, and I don't know what I'm expecting as far as advice. But at this point, I'll take any advice I can get.

TLDR - I want to leave my girlfriend of 2 years, but we're supposed to settle on a new home in 4 weeks and she's moving her 2 kids to be with me. I don't think I can leave her, but I know I should."
45,"Leading up to divorce with my wife[f34] I [m33] began to try and hold her accountable for her responsibilities that she had neglected for the past 2 years, she passed away of an over dose days after our divorce and I feel more and more responsible.


My wife and I were together for 7 years, and in that time we had 4 beautiful children together. Through out the years my wife struggled with borderline personality disorder and refused to do anything about it, and it lead to many ups and downs and some extreme cases where I had to call the police on her. Once because she broke a bowl over my head, but after that she made sure to manipulate me into not calling the police again, making me feel guilty for calling the police on her. 

There were many times after I should have called again but did not until it escalated. This particular night she threw a dresser drawer at my head that split open my forehead, held a knife to my throat and locked me out of our house while holding our new born baby when it was 40 degrees out.  She was arrested again and I bailed her out, I was struggling with battered spouse syndrome. We stayed together and moved to my home city and this made her completely deteriorate. She developed a drug problem and I had to quit my job because she basically refused to watch our children while I worked.  

We got into a huge fight while I was incredibly sick and I snapped back at her which was very uncharacteristic of me, so when I dozed off I woke up to her gone with two of my children, my phone, wallet and car keys gone. Turns out she cleared out my bank account and and went to he friends house which was her dealer. Long story short she’s arrested and goes to jail for 3 months and isn’t allowed to come back home after that. 

She moved to her parents 2 hours away and for over two year I had hope she’d get help, that she’d change even a little bit. After the last incident child protective services got involved and told me to chose between my children and my wife and it wasn’t a hard choice. She had to take assessment, see a therapist, take classes and take weekly urine tests and she did none of it. At first she was allowed to have the kids if she had her mother or sisters supervising, and the kids were going fairly regularly on weekends.  She then moved out of her parents house and the visits weren’t as regular. Then something happened (long story) that she was no longer allowed to see the kids unless under the supervision of a “supervision service”.  It was down hill from there. She stopped seeing the kids entirely, she would talk to me daily but when I would put them in the phone she would fine an excuse to get off the phone. After so many attempts I didn’t want to put my kids through that so I stopped trying. 

Eventually CPS told me I needed to divorce her or they would never close out my case, because they kept telling me legally she could call the police and try and take the kids from me at any point, so they wouldn’t close my case until I had legal custody of my children. Leading up to our divorce I wanted her to understand what was happening, that we’re really getting divorced, that our kids need her in their lives (they hadn’t seen her in 9 months at this point), that she was going to start owing child support. 

So The entire time we were separated I was “lending” my wife money, the summer leading up to our divorce I tried to become more firm with her and I started to really emphasize the word “loan” she was giving me this story that she was working two jobs but she just started the second job and wouldn’t get paid for two pay periods. This was the week our divorce was final so I lent her the money expecting to get paid the following Friday. Then she said she didn’t get paid and needed more money but she’s been working 12 hour days so her check will be huge. I lend her more money. 4 days later she asked for the same amount as of money I lent her the last two times even though she’d get paid in 3 days. I exploded and accused her of using drugs again and said she better not be taking money out of her family’s pockets to pay for drugs. I lend her money anyways but half the amount. Friday comes and she doesn’t transfer money into my account. But she does get the letter in the mail that our divorce was final (she didn’t show up to court). Im at a breaking point, she hasn’t given me a dime for our 4 children in over 2 years, I’ve lent her thousands of dollars, and I just spent 5k on a lawyer to run around and find her to serve her papers. I was her emotional support even through all this but after that Friday she would text me and I would just respond with “when are you going to pay me something back” or “do you realize you are going to start owing $600 a month in child support and if you don’t pay your going to go to jail”. So I just wasn’t very nice and began to badger her about her bad life decisions. I’ve always been her reassurance, but I took that away. 

The following Friday I demanded she pay me back something, anything. $20 just as a sign of good faith. She said she’d go to the bank after work and deposit her check and send me money. I was at a baseball game with my kids that night and I sent her pics and we texted. Around 3am I got a text from her saying “your an amazing father, husband, son, brother and lover, and I will always love you”. I messaged her in the morning and didn’t get a response. Later in the day I got a phone call from her mother that she overdosed on heroine and passed away.  

I feel like because the way I was treating her and because I divorced her, she over dosed on purpose, and it’s killing me. Immediately after I was so concerned with my kids well being that I haven’t addressed my own feelings and now it’s eating away at me. 

Tl;dr I divorced my wife and began to hold her accountable for money she owed and the responsibility of seeing our kids and feel like that led her to over dose on purpose, and it’s destroying me. "
46,"My [27F] boyfriend [30M] took my phone yesterday


My boyfriend only uses his phone for calls and texting (he isn't on social media)- he just doesn't understand why so many people are so ""attached"" to their devices. He doesn't like it when I'm on my phone too much and out of respect I rarely use it when he's around (and never when we're spending time together whether we're out or at home).

Yesterday afternoon I was texting with my sister (who lives in another state) while he was getting ready for work. When he was about to leave I asked him to wait a second so I could say goodbye and give him a kiss but I was finishing my text as I said it, which apparently bothered him. He came to me and turned my face to give me a kiss and as he did it he grabbed my phone. He was smiling and said (in a normal/calm tone) ""you're wasting time on this fucking thing.""I thought he was kidding because of his tone and the way he held it up so I couldn't reach it. He was laughing and walked out the door with it while I was walking after him asking for it back. He said I could live without it for a few hours and got into his car and took off. I wanted to yell but making a scene isn't a good look in front of the neighbors.

So, I waited, assuming he'd bring it back but that didn't happen until he got home at 3AM. I was pretty angry and told him it wasn't okay to take my phone (that's in my name and I pay for) and leave me without any way to call 911 in case of an emergency. Considering he's in law enforcement I thought he would care about my safety but apparently not. He didn't care that I was mad and brushed me off, he said it ended up being busier than he expected and he didn't have time to come back. His stance is nothing happened, I'm fine, he meant to bring it back but couldn't and I should care more about his intentions. I don't think he should have taken it in the first place.

I'm not trying to blow this out of proportion but I am not okay with him taking my phone. Do I need to drop it for now? If I should talk to him again- How do I (tactfully) discuss this to make him understand it can't happen again? I want him to take me seriously and not to laugh because he thinks it's funny that I'm mad. I feel strongly about his actions yesterday and I don't take it lightly that I was left without a phone all night.

tl;dr: My boyfriend took my phone with him to work yesterday evening as a ""punishment"" for being on it too much. He intended to bring it back but had a busier night than expected and ended up keeping it all night. He doesn't understand why I'm angry and he's acting like I'm purposely trying to drag this out and blow it out of proportion."
47,"Update: I(27M) set my sister(25F) up with guy(28M) who will likely hurt her


Original thread: https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/7lkmmf/i27m_set_my_sister25f_up_with_guy28m_who_will/

Remembered about this earlier and thought I would post an update for all those sensible people who told me to butt out (which I did!), because guess who just got engaged? Yup, they remain one of the weirdest couples I've seen, but they're visibly besotted with each other and it seems to work for them, so I'm happy for them.

Now, thoughts on whether I should read my original post out as a my wedding speech? (Joking, mostly...)

48,"Wife [27F] recently gave birth and is denying our newborn daughter


**TLDR: Wife gave birth on Feb. 4th and has denied our daughter is her child from the very beginning. She doesn't want to hold her, or even look at her really. My mom assures me that she will ""snap out of it"", but I'm getting increasingly concerned about her behavior. I admit I am way out of my element here.**

My [30M] lovely wife of three years gave birth to our daughter on February 4th. I know this sounds strange, but my wife claims our daughter is not her child. This has been going on since immediately after she delivered and I am at a complete loss. She refuses to even hold our daughter. 

I talked to my mom about it and she said first baby blues are normal and she would snap out of it, but I'm not so sure. I've been lurking mommy forums and I have yet to come across another woman who refuses to claim her own child. That is so bizarre to me. She was so excited, euphoric even, her whole pregnancy. We both were. Our daughter was 100% planned and wanted.

I don't understand and am trying my best to be supportive. I have hired people to take care of our house and daughter while my wife recovers. She doesn't have to do anything she doesn't want, except relax and get better. However, I have yet to see any improvement in her and I am becoming increasingly concerned. 

I have gently suggested she seek some professional type help which she was doing before the pregnancy. This suggestion was met with her chucking a large, hardback book at me and screamed at me to ""go on down the road with that shit."" That actually is what prompted me to make this post. My wife has never been aggressive to myself, or any living creature. She has never so much as raised her voice in anger in my presence. Again, I reached out to my mom and she told me it was hormones. 

I don't know. I think I have been very understanding so far. Is this normal first time mommy behavior? Am I overreacting? I need a second opinion. "
49,"My boyfriend (30m) doesn’t want me (27f) to take a year off to travel.


At the risk of sounding like a #wanderlust Instagram influencer, I love to travel more than anything else. Exploring new cities for the first time, immersing myself in new cultures and meeting new people and trying new food...it all makes me happier than I can describe.

At the very top of my bucket list has always been to take a gap year and travel the world. I’ve been saving diligently for the past 5 years and finally reached my savings goal for the trip! 3 years ago I started dating my boyfriend, a wonderful man that I now live with. He also makes me ridiculously happy and is the man I have every intention of spending the rest of my life with. 

But he doesn’t exactly agree with my gap year plan. He says long distance never works and a year is a long time to be apart, even if he manages to join me for a week or two. He’s also worried about the dangers of a woman traveling by herself, though I’ve traveled alone multiple times before and am no stranger to it. He says he loves me more than anything, but he thinks the strain of us being apart for so long and him constantly worrying about me could break even the strongest relationship. He also says the money I saved could be used to buy a house or wedding and start our life together. He says leaving my great job would be irresponsible and it may be hard to find another when I get back, but I have savings to life off when I return and I work in a fairly in demand field of IT. There’s also what he won’t say but has implied; he thinks that after months apart I may forget about him a little and be tempted to cheat, which I would never do. 

I’m just so torn. This trip has been my dream for so long now, but now that dream involves returning home to him, and I’m just not sure if that’s possible. I feel like if I don’t go, this will be one of those things I look back on from my deathbed and regret the most. Then again, the same could be said for losing him. 

TLDR: I’ve been planning a gap year to travel the world for years now, but my boyfriend is worried the distance and strain will ruin us. I’m worried I may have to choose between him and my dream to take a year and travel. "
50,"My [29F] boyfriend [28M] wants to give up his career for a pipe dream


So I’ve been together with my boyfriend for 7 years and we’ve lived together for 5 years. All this time, he’s been a great partner and he’s been my best friend. He’s funny, smart, humble - everything I could ask for. Most importantly, he’s incredibly stable. He has a well-paying job, keeps a lot of savings, doesn’t smoke/drink/do drugs/gamble etc, and he always talks about our long-term future plans. We’ve talked about buying a house very soon. 

As stated above, he has a well-paying job. He has a masters in applied statistics and does work in his field. I work as well, so our combined income is great. His hobby has always been the piano and he’s played for almost his whole life, and I’ve always bragged to others about how good he is. (For all you pianists out there, his signature piece is Chopin’s Ballade No.4, which should give you an idea of his skill level.) Recently, he said he wants to quit his job to try and become a professional pianist. At first, I thought it was just a joke and didn’t think much of it. 2 days ago, he told me over dinner about his plans to hand in his resignation form. 

I told him I really didn’t think he could get a stable career as a pianist as I know there are very few paying jobs in the field. He said he knows, but he said it’s always been a pipe dream of his and if he doesn’t at least give it a go, he’ll never forgive himself. I asked him how long he’s going to try it for, and he said he doesn’t know. I told him I was very worried that if he leaves his job now, he might not be able to get a position as good as his now. He then said that he wasn’t enjoying his job anymore, so he probably wouldn’t even go back to his field. On that, we ended on a sour note as I think he sensed that I wasn’t being very supportive. Am I being unreasonable here? Any advice would be appreciated. 

Thank you. 

TL;DR: boyfriend wants to quit a good career to become a pianist."
51,"Boyfriend [25M] has locked himself in our bedroom because he's mad at me [25F].


We've been together for 5 years, lived together for 3.5. We've had fights before that required some space to cool down, but this time is different.

We got home after a small friend gathering last night and he immediately locked himself in the guest bedroom after using the restroom. No words said,  no argument had. Our drive home was quiet but it normally is when we're on our way home at 2 in the morning. We've had a few arguments about my behavior coming off too flirtatious around other men when we're all drinking. So I have a good idea that that is what the underlying issue is here, even though he's not speaking to me.

He's been locked in the room for over twelve hours. I bought us breakfast this morning and he refused to come out saying that he wasn't hungry. I replied saying okay but I'm ready to talk about the matter whenever he is ready to come out. It has been radio silence since. Our walls are pretty thin and I haven't even heard him move. He has not exited to eat, drink, or even pee (I dont even want to know how he's making that work). We've needed space from each other after getting angry before, but this is the first time in our relationship that he is going out of his way to deprive himself just to avoid me. I am the opposite of confrontational and have a habit of shutting down verbally when he's angry with me, so I'm not sure why he feels like he can't even walk past me to take care of his needs.

I guess I just dont know what to do in this situation. Do I just keep waiting it out? Do I try to make contact and suggest I'm the one who hides out for a while so he can come out while still having space? Should I ask if I can come in so we can talk? I want to give him the space he needs to cool off but I hate that he's making himself suffer. I also wonder if maybe he's looking for me to start the dialogue, even though he's the one behind a locked door?

TLDR: Boyfriend's mad at me for unclear reason. Has been locked in a room for over 12 hours. How to proceed."
52,"My friend [42/M] mistakenly sold some artwork of mine [40/F] in his shop for less than I was asking, now we can't reach a resolution.


Hi all,
Title pretty much sums it up.  

I am a professional artist.  My friend owns a consignment shop and sells some of my paintings.  The other night he sold one for less than the asking price by mistake.  The amount he sold it for minus the consignment fee means I made almost nothing on it.  

He texted e the other night and said, ""Hey how much is that painting again?""

I told him.  And then he texted back, ""Oh... well I sold it today for $XXX.  Oops.""  

I told him I am glad he sold it, but then I asked how we should deal with the discrepancy.  He doesn't want to do much about it.  His defense is that prices on my paintings are negotiable.  And yes, they are, when *I* am selling them.  In the past customers have haggled with him over my work and he has texted me asking if I am willing to sell for the offer they are making, etc.  This time there was no asking.  I am under the impression the customer didn't haggle.  It sounds to me like he just made a mistake and forgot the actual price. 

If I were in his shoes (and I have been, I have sold art for other people at times.) it would be a no brainer.  His mistake, he pays the difference.  But he doesn't want to.   

The only offer he has made is to donate to charity in my name.  Right now he is doing a fundraiser to help kids with cancer.  He offered to make a donation in my name for his fundraiser, but the amount he offered to donate isn't even half of what he deducted from the painting.  If he wants donations I will be happy to make a donation, but him donating a small amount of money in my name doesn't change the fact that I am not getting what I asked for for my painting.  

I have sold stuff in his shop for two years, and this kind of thing has never happened before.  So what do you guys think I should do?  

TL:DR
My friend sold my artwork for less than what I was asking for it and now doesn't seem interested in correcting it.  "
53,"My girlfriend [21/F] just pulled a prank on me and I'm thinking of breaking up with her.


I've posted here about my girlfriend and her family recently moving into a new house that she claims is haunted. She's been spending as much time as possible at my apartment because she claims to be too scared to stay at the house. I've had many doubts about her claims and this has lead to fights between us. She's mad that I won't believe her and I get tired of hearing about this nonsense, so I decided to spend the night at her house last night.

I went to her house and I was greeted by her parents. They both looked really upset and her dad just said ""It's at your own risk if you want to stay here tonight."" I didn't think much of that and most of the night was full of weird events. My girlfriend kept complaining that she ""didn't feel right"". She would just spend most of the night lying in her bed and saying that she doesn't feel like herself. I just chalked it up to her being sick and I offered to leave, but her dad told me to stay since she wanted someone by her side for the night. I stayed by her side while she lay in bed and when I went to get her a glass of water, a door slammed shut behind me. I didn't see either of her parents in sight and I also heard pounding, like someone banging on the walls. I told my girlfriend about it, but was only half-listening. She asks me ""Would you still love me even if I was possessed?"" I didn't answer and I just told her to get some sleep and feel better in the morning.

I slept on the floor of her room in a sleeping bag since I didn't want to catch whatever she had, but I was woken up in the middle of the night by something being poured on me. I woke up and saw my girlfriend standing over me and holding a red gas can while pouring liquid on me. I could smell gasoline. My girlfriend was pouring gas on me. I yelled at her to stop, but she had this blank look on her face the whole time and I kept shouting her name, but she just kept blankly staring at me while splashing gas on me. I got up and tried to stop her, but she pulled out a lighter and held it to me. I backed into the wall and I was screaming at her to stop as she moved closer to me with the lighter. I legitimately thought that she was going to light me on fire and I kept shouting her name. She finally spoke and said ""There is no Madison, there is only Zuul"" and then she burst out laughing. She shouted ""PRANK!"" and she brought in her parents who were also laughing.

My girlfriend explained that she was only pouring water on me and the gas smell just came from her having hidden a gas-stained cloth under my pillow and by my face. Her parents were the ones who were slamming the doors and pounding the walls from earlier. My girlfriend also explains that she was lying about her claims of the house being haunted and that this was just a long-term prank that was two weeks in the making. I didn't even know what to say. I just packed up my stuff, yelled at my girlfriend that I legitimately thought that I was going to be burned alive, but her dad steps in and starts yelling at me not to yell at his daughter. I just left and now I seriously am considering breaking up with my girlfriend over this. Should I?

54,"Me [30F] with my husband [30M] of 7 years; he lied to me about a trip he took with his mom (50s F) and tried to buy me off to make up for it.


Throwaway because I JUST got my husband into Reddit so...you know.

TL;DR: I wanted to go to a bucket list location for Valentines Day and husband said we couldn't afford it. Accidently found out he's there this weekend with his mom and he deliberatly hid it from me and justified it by saying he was trying to surprise me with a gift from the city. 

Background info (trying to keep is as short as possible, I'm sorry):
I love my husband, we have a pretty strong relationship. I used to be really close to his mom and dad until the last two years or so. His sister is not only his best friend but also mine.
My distaste for his mother started when I found out that she had done some very disgusting, disturbing and predatory things to SIL throughout her lifetime. SIL put up a good front for the sake of my husband for a decade but once a straw broke the camel's back, she decided my husband was old enough to know the truth and she promptly went no contact with MIL. 
My husband and FIL new a lot of the stuff that happened, but not all. My husband was overall distrustful of MIL but maintained a strained relationship because she's sick and he's afraid she'll die and he'll have regrets. FIL had a stroke not long after SIL went NC and though he recovered and is physically fine, he is a completely different person now and has made some very hurtful and abusive life choices regarding his children. He teamed up with his estranged wife to villainize SIL. We all cut contact with him after, but my husband still maintained a relationship with his mom despite everything. 
We had a couple of arguments about his mom and ultimately decided that he can do whatever he wants in that category but that I will not have anything to do with his mother because of my principles. And, frankly, I think SIL needs some mother fucking support right now. As a woman, a wife, sister, daughter, and HUMAN I just cannot condone the things she's done, regardless how sick MIL may or may not be at any given time (which is usually when it's most convenient for her).

Switching gears: Husband and I are currently doing long distance because of his job. It's temporary, we're pretty used to it and we make it work. For Valentines Day, I wanted to meet up with him in a city near his current location that I've been pining after for some time now. He talked me out of it because of money and we agreed it would be more cost effective for him to just come to me and we'd have a nice weekend in. No big deal. A week after our time together I relocated to our new town. He had told me his mom wanted to drive up to meet him the weekend of my road trip, and I asked him to put it off a week in case I needed some assistance or something. He agreed, all was fine.

Now to the problem at hand. I had totally forgotten that they had plans when I called him this afternoon. I hurried off the phone because I just don't want any part in any of it and I wanted to just leave them to it. I never asked where they were meeting or what they were doing for the same reason. An hour or so later, I clicked on our conversations and then on his contact info to track down an old picture I sent him. When I clicked on the info button, his current location was live. We had location sharing on during my drive so he could give my family updates and we just never turned it off. He was in the city I wanted to go to for Valentines Day...with the woman I despise the most in the world. 

He's not a stupid man. He knows how I would feel about this and he never once bothered to mention it. I texted him and casually asked where they had decided to go for the weekend. He said somewhere north of the state capital, then I watched as his location went from ""live"" to ""unavailable."" I asked what town. He said they were near [insert other town nearby]. Then he tried changing the subject to small talk. I shut it down. I told him I knew exactly where he was and that I was hurt and confused by why he was being so shady. 

He told me that he knew I'd be disappointed that I couldn't go so he thought he'd sneak in and out and get me something to make up for it. I told him I couldn't deal with this at the moment and that I'd talk to him Sunday. I honestly just don't want his disgusting mother to know we're in a fight and fill his head with whatever smut she comes up with. 

I've asked myself all sorts of questions. Would I feel the same if he went with anyone else? No. Is that petty? Maybe. Idk. I also don't think he'd feel the need to be so sneaky or that he'd need to make anything up to me if he were there with anyone else. Do I feel like his heart was in the right place? Debatable. He knew he was doing something that would hurt me and chose to lie and sneak. Regardless if he didn't do this maliciously, he knew exactly how this would play out. If he didn't, then his empathy level is something to be concerned about. 

Am I crazy? Am I overreacting? How do I approach this?"
55,"Husband wants us (29m and 30f) to be friends with this couple (similar age) and i don't want to.


(Married ~3 years)

He and the husband of the other couple really like each other and get along great. We go to the same very specific and uncommon type of church, so we have the same views and it's hard to find that, and we have similar aged kids.

 But the wife and i do not hit it off, ever. I'm introverted and socially anxious and so is she- not that we ever talk, i can just tell. She has a lot of other friends from the church and is always busy with them on Sundays. I too have my own friend i talk to after Mass who i love, so this wife and i never ever talk. 

Periodically they invite us over for dinner and it just murders me. When we go over for dinner we (wives) don't even talk, just the dudes. It's awful. Husband does not understand how awkward this is for me. Whenever i find out we've been invited over, i spend the entire week or however long dreading it. It takes far more out of me than i get from it. 

Ordinarily i would just stop going. Like, i don't usually go with my husband when he hangs out with his other friends, but there's this *existing pretense* that we are all friends as families and i hate it. We're not. They have 4 girls and 1 boy. We have 2 boys. Their boy is the same age as our oldest boy, but their boy is like 1/3rd the size and very shy and doesn't like to play with our huge boy, and the girls don't really play with him either. Our kids are not friends. Me and the wife are not friends. Only the men are friends. I just can't tell you how excrutiating this effort is for me to be a part of.

So i feel like i can't stop going because we are NEVER going to change churches (our beliefs are exactly the same like i said lol) and so if i drop out of this charade, I'll still be seeing them every week and that would be equally awkward. 

Idk how to solve this ongoing debacle. 

Tl;dr i don't want to be a part of this ""couples friendship"" anymore but quitting will be awkward because we all will still see each other. "
56,"I [28M] don't know what to say to an old crush [29F] when she asked why I ghosted her after a traumatic injury.


I terrible with relationships so I need some advice. 

  
Backstory:

I (28M) have known Sarah (29F) since 7th grade. She was a grade above me and we met in extracurricular activities. We are like carbon copies and quickly took a liking to each other. We started hanging out and running around outside of school, flirting, calling (no texting then), but I never made a big move because I had severe social anxiety as a teen. She also started getting a lot of attention from the older boys in school so she ended up dating them. But I couldn't shake my feelings for her. The flirting and attention and time spent together continued and I realized I'd fallen hard. To this day I've never felt that way about a girl. By HS I'd had a car, was getting older and after getting tired of me not making a move she expressed an interest in dating me after she was cheated on by an older boy. I was ecstatic! But as fate would have it, soon after I was in a car wreck which left me a quadriplegic. I describe it by saying I died that day and woke up in the same environment in a new body that I didn't recognize or couldn't move. My life shattered.

Words cannot describe the heartbreak and traumatic pain I went through the next few years. Depression, confusion, frustration, hard hard circumstances in all aspects of life, including socially and romantically. Regarding Sarah, she tried to pretend things were the same, but I was the practical one. We were both very adventurous, athletic and affectionate people and now we were completely incompatible because of my limitations.  It was like a knife in my chest everytime I saw her because I know I couldn't make her happy anymore. It was especially hard when I'd see pictures on social media of her and some dude doing things we used to do but I can't do anymore. It was like tortue. I knew I needed to move on, that it wasn't good for my mental health. It was the most pain I've ever felt knowing she's better with someone else now, someone like I used to be. I couldn't bear to burden her with my insecurities, especially when she's just living her life, so I kept my problems to myself, intentionally distanced myself, faded away and eventually unfriended her from all social media and quietly declined when she sent a future friend request.

&amp;#x200B;

Now my dilemma:

These days I am doing unbelievably well, all things considered. I am still in a wheelchair. However, I've been working hard to get as much of my life back as I can and just be normal again. I graduated in sciences. I have a really cool job in a really competitive industry. I drive a vehicle. I take care of myself and live alone in a small apartment that I rent, buying a home soon. I do still get very lonely of course. I haven't focused on trying to date yet and instead have focused on my physical and mental wellbeing first which is going really well. Recently I've started doing active stuff again like skydiving and swimming. Well, it turns out these days Sarah (lives in a different city) works part-time as a swimming instructor. I've avoided her for years so that I could heal, but she'd heard that I'm doing well and was overjoyed I was swimming again and wants to reconnect and suggested swimming together sometime. I'm not sure if I can do it though. Of course I want to. I do still miss her, as pathetic as that is 10 years later.  That heartbreak is still there though. She is single now and I know myself well enough that if I reconnect I'll develop strong feeling for her again which will leave me feeling like shit since we're still fundamentally incompatible (she's very sexual, and, despite having working equipment, I can't compete with a normal dude). I can't imagine her intentions are anything but friendly, however I worry seeing her would be like a cruel tease. I don't want to experience heartbreak again. It just sucks. I feel stuck. It feels really disappointing and unfair to her to reject the opportunity because of my own inadequacies. It feels immature, is it? She wants to know why I ghosted. I go back and forth whether I should communicate my problems when there is no solution to the problem. Do I  keep my distance, or try to reconnect and try to endure the pain from my inadequacies. Do I explain things? I don't want to the first interaction to dump a bunch of old depressing life problems on her.  But I also want to communicate and not lie. I don't know what to do.

57,"I (24F) want to propose to GF (24F) at the end of the year. She's 100% on board and I'm excited, but how do I get over my (likely needless) fear of other people's opinions on the matter?


 

First post here, please be gentle lol. TL;DR at bottom.

My partner, who I'll call Z, and I have an amazing, loving, fun relationship, and I have no doubt in my mind that I want to marry her. Z and I have been together for 1.5 years and get along fantastically; we share a lot of interests, enjoy a great amount of time both together and separately, get along well with each other's friends, and my family loves her and seems to accept her as one of their own (she even celebrated Christmas with us this year, which was a cross-country trip, and she's attending my brother's college graduation with us out of state in May). We do have the occasional disagreement as any couple would, but we always resolve it. We communicate quite well generally, and have talked about all the important future things--future kids (or lack thereof) and when to have them/how to raise them, finances, career goals, religion, where to live, even future pets, etc.-- and are well aligned on all these things. No one else makes me happier or ever has (and this is also neither of our first relationships; I had a past relationship of 2+ years *which ended over a year before I even met Z*), and I'm sure I want to spend the rest of my life with Z. And yes, Z and I have talked about it, we both feel the same way, and we have discussed a proposal timeline (as per my title, at least 9 months but probably more than 12). We are officially moving in together in June and would do sooner if leases allow; we wanted to start co-habitation last June but decided it was too early and it would benefit our relationship to spend another year with separate apartments (which has gone well even though we sleep together most nights we are happy with this decision). If it's relevant, we were also both raised in religious families and marriage is important to us both spiritually and socially. We do not live together but spend most nights together, already do chores and generally live as if we do.

Here's where the issue (?) comes in: despite overwhelming support of our relationship from friends and my family (Z's family does not approve because I am a woman and not of the religion that she was raised in-- and no longer follows for reasons unrelated to our relationship-- but that's a whole other story) and me soon to be in a good place to propose to Z (will be finishing graduate school this spring and securing a job in a decently high-earning field after being a student my whole life). I'm wanting to propose in mid December, at which time we'll have been dating for 27 months. Plenty of time in my opinion. If it's relevant, I'm 100% good with a long engagement and/or just a small civil ceremony, as is Z, this isn't really about having a wedding for either of us. I'll be 25 by the time I want to propose and working a full time career/financially independent, we will have lived together for 6 months (important to both of us), we want to move abroad together in late 2020 or early 2021 (something we are both passionate about, have talked logistics about a lot, and are taking actions to begin to set this plan in motion) and although it's NOT AT ALL why we want to get married, being married might help with the whole going abroad together process. Everything makes sense to me, we're on the same page, and I know I am ready...so why am I so nervous to tell people, especially my family (some extended family are also maybe not going to be ok with me marrying a woman, though Z has *never* been kept a secret)?

Mostly, I think it's because I'm worried that people will think we're rushing into this, even though logically I know I'm not; I'd wait forever for Z if necessary and would be with her even if she didn't want to get married, it just seems like a great time and I'm excited to be able to call her my fiancee and then wife, and I know we've had all the necessary conversations. However, I've heard so many conversations in my life about people being too young or engaging too soon and have seen the disastrous consequences of rushing into marriage...I'm rambling. I don't think being engaged at 25 and married at 26-27 is too young, personally, especially with a couple years' dating under our belt, and I don't have any reason to suspect I'll get negative feedback either. But the more I think about December as a timeline, the more I'm worried I'll get a negative reaction from people for doing so (even though it is 100% what both Z and I want).

So, Reddit, how do I get out of my head, knowing that this is what I want and that Z is the person for me, and commit to myself and what we've talked about? Any advice on how I trust in what I want and knowing what is best for me? I've always been a bit of a people pleaser and have lived my life by what other people think I should be doing; how to get myself to trust my own instincts on this plan and my relationship with Z?

TL;DR: I want to propose to my girlfriend of 1.5 years, Z, in December and am confident in my choice of doing so. Z is in the know and 100% on board. How do I get past the fear of others disapproving of my choice?"
58,"My (23F) friends (20M) (20F) left my room disgusting after a housing crisis. Should I confront or ghost?


This is a bit of a ride to explain. At the beginning of January, mine and my roommate's friends, a young engaged couple, found themselves in a hostile living situation. We offered them my bedroom for a few nights, and a few nights extended to halfway through February. This we didn't mind. It was awkward, I had to share a bed with my roommate, lived out of boxes, etc, but we were helping friends.

The girl suffers from severe agoraphobia. To the point where she never left the bed or bedroom except to shower. This didn't bother me too much, as I have my own mental health issues. I am a clean freak, however, and it DID bother me that whenever I could glance into my bedroom it was generally covered in trash. Trash that included food waste, specifically. It was still my bedroom, you know? But I didn't say anything bc they had just gotten out of a tough situation with horrid roommates and she was really still on edge. I didn't want her to feel targeted.

When they finally left, I discovered that despite me giving them spare sheets, they had not changed the bedding once, and we had heard them have sex at LEAST twice. This freaked me out. A lot. I'm not an agoraphobe by any means, but the bed itself reeked of sweat. I was able to pull off the initial cover on it (it's a Zinus) and wash most of the stench out, but I ended up flipping out and selling the mattress and replacing it with a new one.

When we removed the mattress is when I really lost it, though. At the time of them staying, we had kittens. They took one with them, but the kittens were in and out of the room a LOT. The underside of my bed reeked of cat piss, and there was a LOT of shit. What's worse, half a set of heels my dad had gifted me had basically been marinating in it. They aren't like couture or anything but Gianni Bini isn't a five dollar shoe either. They hadn't even told us. I would have gladly cleaned it up, but instead it had just sat there. (Yes, I cleaned under the bed vigorously with a lot of vinegar. Still can't get out the smell. Cleaning advice is also appreciated.)

Needless to say, I was furious. Still AM mad and have been sitting on it for weeks. In part I want to confront them. But another part of me just wants to cut them off and never speak to them again. They haven't reached out since they moved into their new place anyways. I don't know what to do.

**TL:DR friends were in a housing crisis and left my room disgusting, to the point of throwing out furniture. I don't know if I should confront or ghost.**"
59,"My (F41) husband (M38) is demanding that my company hire him but I know now that he doesn't actually support me.


My husband, I'll call him Dave, and I have been together ten years and work in the same field.  It is competitive and moves fast.  Both of us have struggled to establish ourselves, and done a good job of it, getting good contracts and we are both well respected by our peers.  However the contract nature means that there's always the possibility of periods of unemployment between work, and it can be hard to keep your morale up.  We've both been at it for a long time now and have lots of experience with that part of the job.

Recently (last couple of years) some colleagues and I made our own start up, one that specifically caters to women's needs.  We've worked our butts off to make the business grow and we've established ourselves in the industry to the point where we've been able to enjoy a regular client base and solid to good income.

While this has been going on my husband is still in the regular routine of making bids for jobs, always waiting for client companies to hire him.  My steady income has been an incredible boon for us during this time, and I've been paying on average %80 of the monthly expenses.  I emphasize average because there are some bills that he regularly pays, and when he's working more he contributes.  But it's me and my income from this startup that has been the reliable bulk of the income that makes sure the roof is over our head, the lights are on and there's food on the table.

I want to make it clear that I don't mind being the breadwinner nor do i hold that against him.  Certainly after our son was born and I couldn't work he was the one out in the workplace while i was home.  (I did go back to work part time after three months because we don't get parental leave in our field).  I know that any stability we have is not guaranteed and I'm proud to be able to provide for us and support him while I can.  I also think he's incredibly good at his job.

When I was first spending a lot of time getting the business going he struggled a lot with feelings of low self-esteem.  It takes a lot to keep morale up at the best of times, and the sight of my business achieving a lot of success while he was going through hard times really got to him.  We went through a long phase where he would take his resentment out on me with shitty emails and texts, demanding that I be home more even when he knew that me and my work were what was keeping us fed and housed, complaining about the unfairness of our industry.  He would minimize what I contributed to the household, namely all the finances, saying ""that's all you do"".  It was very hard.  I sympathized with him because I've been there too, but it was very hurtful to have him dumping on me that way. He is not white, and faces subtle racism at work and in the world.  He became focussed on that problem and how it impacts him and others in our profession.  He's not wrong about that, but he started blaming any work that he didn't get on race.  Again, he's not wrong, but at the same time he's, to be honest, kind of lazy.  He spends a lot of his time gaming, not doing any professional development, not doing the hustle that all of us have to do to secure contracts.  He would get defensive and petulant and hard to talk to.  I struggled to balance sympathizing with tough love, or to figure out when to listen and when to give helpful advice.

At some points it was a 24/7 pity party. I almost left, but decided to stay.  At the time it was for the sake of our son, but since then we've been able to work through it to a large degree.  He's genuinely been better about dealing with his feelings and slowly has gotten a handle on not taking it out on me.  When he's not resentful, he's great.  I love being with him, talking to him, and I'm glad I stayed.  Watching him work through his feelings and grow is one of my joys of our committed relationship. He's even gotten to the point where he's trying to start his own business, which I think is fantastic.  He and his partner have had a few false starts finding investors but their business plan is solid and I think they would be great successes.

During this time I've made sure that our company has hired him regularly when we have large jobs.  All of us who started it are committed to lifting our families and colleagues with us and I'm not the only one who has their significant other involved.  I try to strike the right respectful balance and not bring him in so much that other people resent him or that he seems like he's getting all the work.  He's great at his job whenever we use him and it's been helpful to him to be associated with our company.  I know for a fact that other jobs for him came out of contacts he made while working with us.  

I really thought we were getting to a good place and I had really begun to let go of the anxiety I feel around my success.  I felt more confident in him and trusted him more, and it was great to feel that I didn't have to walk on eggshells.  Also he had a pretty good year last year, and I thought he had matured and really started to own his shit.  

Well, cut to last night.  We have both have laptops that are around the house.  We mostly use our own but quite regularly reach for the other person's if it's closer and we want to hop on the interwebs.  On his laptop I use Chrome while he uses Safari, so we each have our own pages logged in on the different browsers.  So, I'm on youtube when Messages starts popping up replies from the text conversation he's having with a mutual friend while he's in the other room.  When that happens i usually notice them but ignore them, that is until one of them says ""Yeah that's fucked up you feel you have to beg your wife for a job.""  Reddit, I am not that strong, I went and clicked on the conversation.  

There it was, all the resentment I thought he'd left behind.  He was complaining that another colleague's girlfriend works with us because he thinks he is more experienced than her.  I'll call her Melanie.  I can't agree with his take on her working with us because a) he has it wrong, she works with us occasionally, and it works out to just as much time as he does and b) yes, he's got more direct experience, but she has a related PhD,  - and she's a woman.  Our business caters to women.  Also, and here's where it gets emotional for me, she is a huge supporter of our business.  He is not.  Unless I'm actually hiring him, he doesn't go out of his way to ask about it and I learned in the bad times to just not mention it because it bothered him so much.  I knew all this, but in the text conversation he confessed to his friend that he's never actually read any of the stuff I've sent him, he's never watched the promotional videos we've worked so hard on.  (In our everyday life he's even made comments about how he's kind of sick of white women and doesn't, for example, want to go see movies about them.  Now I realize, I'm in that category.) Yet in the same text convo last night, while he's admitting he's taken almost no interest in my business, he's complaining that we haven't given him a more permanent job, and that he deserves it.  

Reddit, how do I handle this? First, I shouldn't even know all this.  I own that I went and read a conversation not meant for me.  Do I act on this knowledge of how he really feels?  Or does it count more that he is trying to give me his good side?  Is that part of how he deals with his feelings, venting to someone?

Secondly, it's very hard not to take this personally.  I sympathize with his feelings of being deprived but goddammit, it would be really nice to have enthusiastic support from my life partner.  It's very hard not to add up all the times he's completely failed to say ""I'm so proud of you"" or come out to our events or let me celebrate my wins like I can with anyone else in my life.  I don't want to fall into a dynamic of hoarding a list of grievances.

Thirdly, and I'm beginning to think this is the more important, I think I've lost respect for him.  What kind of person thinks they deserve to be handed a job at a company they clearly have disdain for and have done little to know research on? A spoiled child, that's who.  And now I'm thinking of him that way, that he's a spoiled teen who demands his mom give him a break.  And he ALREADY works with us.  But now, I'm resenting the opportunities I've given him.

I don't know how to talk to him about this without activating all his old anger and defensiveness.  God knows my own anger is activated right now.  This time of year is traditionally his worst, what with the sun going away and the shit weather.   I don't want to talk to him about it until I'm more calm.

Please help me think this through, give me insight, help me with my perspective.  How do I regain my respect for my husband?  How do I let him work out his feelings of resentment without becoming resentful myself?

**TL,DR: My husband resents my professional success but also thinks my company that he barely supports should give him a job.  I am having trouble respecting him now.**"
60,"My [32F] partner [38M] of 2 years does not want me to spend the night with female friends after going out


On a few occassions if I go out with the girls, I have planned that if I drink too much and don't feel safe driving, I would spend the night at a girlfriend's house. 

He doesn't agree with this and wants me to come home. When asked why, he says it's just immature and irresponsible for grown women to sleep over somewhere else instead of coming home to their partner. (We live together.) He says I should just limit myself to one drink and come home.

I don't agree and feel like 1) making alternate plans to stay somewhere is precisely the responsible thing to do if one is not safe to drive and 2) he is being a bit controlling and this is not an uncommon thing that other women might do. 

We are a straight couple and both of us rarely go out, so it's not a question of frequency or sexual jealousy. He just says it's weird and childish. Is it really that weird or is he being controlling? How can we resolve this?

TLDR: Live in boyfriend says it's immature to crash at a female friend's house after a night out and insists I return home."
61,"my [28m] sister [16f] sister pretended to not know me in front of her friends (presumably because she was mad at me) and it got tense in public. What should I do?


My sister and I had planned to go to a nearby beach town. We had been talking about it for a while and she was excited. Initially we were going to go this weekend, but on Thursday suddenly we got a massive unexpected project at work with crazy overtime, so I sadly had to cancel.

Yesterday I went to our parents home for dinner and talked to her, apologized again and she was mad and being passive aggressive (""well since I have *nothing* to do this weekend I'm gonna stay at my friend's""). I wanted to honestly tell her I was sorry but she was being a bit of a brat about it so maybe later, right?

Earlier tonight (about 7pm) a co-worker and I went to a minimart for refreshments and she was just outside with two of her friends, skating nearby I think. I got close and said that I thought she would be back home by now. She looked at funny me and said, are you talking to me, freak?

I laughed awkwardly because she said it pretty loud and kinda stared at her waiting for her to laugh or tell me she was joking, but she didn't say anything and I said ""are you for real"", and her friend said ""what TF do you want, weirdo?"" real loud and a few people turned their heads.

I stood there a few seconds totally confused just looking at her but she didn't say anything. Her other friend stood up and I decided to go into the minimart, and one of them said, yeah walk away, asshole, again pretty loud.

I got the stuff and walked out, I didn't even look in the direction they were in when leaving so I don't know if they left or not. Later I texted her what was that all about, other people could have thought I was harassing her and I could have gotten in trouble for no reason. She hasn't replied or even read the texts, but she's been active so she's just ignoring me I guess.

I assume this happened because she's still mad at me for cancelling the trip, but JFC. It wouldn't be the first time she acts out for not getting her way but I think this crossed a really hard fucking line. I will most likely not have time to see her tomorrow. In the meantime should just wait for a text back or what?

Should I try to talk directly to her or our parents? Why TF would she do this?

**tl;dr:** Sister pretended to not know who I was when I talked to her in public (presumably because she was mad at me for cancelling a trip), insulted me and her friends seemingly thought I was harassing her. She isn't texting me back for an explanation. What should I do?"
62,"Me(34/f) and my bf(28/m) of 2 yrs have been discussing marriage and he paid for my engagement ring out of our joint account using my tax refund. Am I wrong for being upset and feeling like I paid for my ring?


My bf and I have been together for 2 years but I've known each other for 8 years. I am divorced with three kids. He is the most amazing and wonderful individual. Is an absolutely wonderful step parent to the kids and they absolutely adore him as much as I do. I am just ticked off but I feel like just bought my ring. I have asked him to sell his guns to pay me back. I have no issue with him having these guns since we usually go to the range together for an occasional date night. Am I wrong for this? Should I just go with it? This honestly would not be the first time I've had to pay for my ring since I did the same thing with my ex-husband. I was just hoping that this time would be different.

I had other plans for those funds to take us on a family weekend getaway. He spent $1500 which is what it was gonna cost for our family weekend trip. 

TL/DR am I wrong for being upset that he paid for my engagement ring using my tax return money. "
63,"My girlfriend [32F] keeps trying to convince me that I [29M] and not allergic to milk


  I was born with a milk allergy as well as other common allergies like corn, wheat, etc. They all went away after a few years and I lived most of my childhood allergy free. In my early 20’s I was having a lot of stomach issues and after many doctor visits, I was prescribed an allergy test. Turns out that my milk allergy came back. I took milk out of my diet, got a prescription for epi-pens, stocked up on Benadryl and it was all good. A year after that, I became vegan anyway so the milk allergy didn’t affect me at all other than having to tell restaurants about it to avoid contamination.

I met my girlfriend about 3.5 years ago and she is also vegan and has been for more than half of her life. When I first told her about my milk allergy, I almost got the impression that she was envious of me that I had a legit reason not to consume cow’s milk. It didn’t really get brought up again for a while since we never have milk or cheese anyway. About a year or two years ago though she started to make comments that she didn’t think I was actually allergic to milk. Whenever I would tell waiters at restaurants, or say I needed to pick up my epi-pen from the pharmacy, she would say things like “I don’t actually think you’re allergic to milk…”. I told her that when I was around milk I’d have explosive diarrhea, itchy skin, etc. Also you can’t just get a prescription for epi pens unless you have an allergy test. She eventually agreed that I was allergic to milk when I got the test done, but she thinks it went away.

I haven’t had any allergic reactions or had the test redone, so yeah sure maybe she’s right it went away. But she brings it up SO OFTEN and it doesn’t matter!! Even if I wasn’t allergic to milk anymore, I wouldn’t consume it anyway, so who cares? She almost seems annoyed when I tell people because she thinks I’m lying or even bragging about my allergy. She wants me to get tested again but I don’t see the point. Sometimes she’ll accuse me of buying milk chocolate and eating it in secret. I’ll tell her why would I do that, I’m allergic to milk. And she’ll reply “That’s the only thing that’s stopping you from buying milk? It's not like you're even allergic!”

How do I get her to stop bringing it up? It is so frustrating that she randomly decided I don’t have an allergy and keeps trying to convince me of it. We have gotten into actual fights over this and it just seems so ridiculous to me that it’s something that is even fought over.

TL;DR I got tested and results came back that I’m allergic to milk. Girlfriend refuses to believe that I’m actually allergic and it’s driving me crazy."
64,"My [37M] wife [35F, 11 years] got a medical diagnosis I'm worried might be incorrect. How can I talk her into getting a second opinion?


Please note, I’m NOT looking for medical advice, I’m looking for ‘how do I get my wife to look for medical advice’ advice. 

I’ll try to keep this short—basically, my wife fainted in line at the grocery store three weeks ago. Two ambulances came. The first one only had basic equipment so they couldn’t check her out in depth, but they said her heart was beating very fast and her blood pressure was very low. By the time the second ambulance got there with fancier equipment, everything was fine. The hospital couldn’t find any reason for why it happened and told her to make an appointment with her regular doctor.

She went to see her “regular” doctor on Friday. She usually only goes to his office once a year and sees the nurse practitioner who works there, but she’s on vacation. So the doctor has never actually met her before this.

He convinced her the reason she fainted was because she had a panic attack. I guess a spider crawled on her hand while she’d been picking out fruit, and he thinks that’s what caused it. I think this is BS, though, because my wife has never had a panic attack or any problems with anxiety before. She’s not even particularly afraid of spiders. Plus, thinking back on it, there were a few other times in the past year where she almost fainted. At the time we just wrote them off because there were other explanations, but now I wonder if she isn’t having episodes of some kind. 

When we were at the hospital, they said her doctor might refer her to a specialist for more tests that the ER can’t do. I really want her to call the office back and ask for a referral to one of these specialists, or at least to make an appointment with the nurse practitioner she usually sees so she can ask her for one. She has pretty good insurance and we have a couple bucks saved up, so it’s not like we’re going to bankrupt ourselves with medical debt or anything. I told her that even though she feels alright, I would feel much better if she saw someone else. And if nothing is wrong, she gets to say ‘I told you so.’ But from her perspective, she already went to the hospital, and then the other doctor, and they gave her a diagnosis, so that’s that. She’s getting more annoyed with me every time I bring it up.

What can I say or do to convince her to look further into this? I’m pretty much just making things worse at this point, because she can be really stubborn. My main worry is that even if this keeps happening, she won’t do anything or get it checked because now she thinks it’s just a panic attack. 

\*\*TL:DR- My wife fainted and her doctor told her it was a panic attack. I think she should get more tests done to make sure it isn’t something more serious, but she doesn’t want to. How can I change her mind?\*\*"
65,"Girl (25/F) I'm (28/F) dating took me to her sister's house and proceeded to angrily rant about me in front of everyone, then kicked me out


Yesterday, F and I went to her sister's house where she lives with her boyfriend. On meeting F at the station, we went on to grab some snacks and stuff from a local shop. Because we had to eat snacks, I became a little frustrated at this, because I'm currently going to the gym and trying to eat better and I couldn't find anything suitable to eat. My mood was a little dampened by this, but I was still up for going to the sister's house.

When F asked me what was wrong, I explained that I was feeling frustrated at not being able to find anything suitable to eat. She snapped ""well, go home, or go to a different shop!"" and ""hurry up, we're going to be late!"" Her general demeanour was quite rushed, and she seemed to be frustrated with me. I recognise that I am a grown adult and didn't expect her to find me anything, but I had been asked what was wrong, so I told her. That was her response. 

As we walked up to F's sister's house, I was repeatedly told that if I didn't 'fix' my mood, I might as well turn around and go home, or that I wasn't welcome in the house if I continued to 'act like this'. Again, I was fine and able to switch my mood into something else once I'd reached the sister's, but F only seemed to get angrier and angrier. The increasing tension was making things worse; had this not been mentioned again, things would have been fine. She began walking faster and faster in front of me, and I could just tell that she was getting more tense. 

When we got to the sister's, things appeared to have calmed down, until F suddenly took a stand in the middle of the living room and began telling Sister and Sister's Boyfriend all about my miserable behaviour on the way to the house, detailing every little facial expression, every thing 'wrong' I'd done up to that point. Sister and Sister's Boyfriend didn't say a word, and stared at the floor throughout this. I didn't say much, either. I was feeling anxious at this point, and confused as to why someone was standing there ranting about me and making things worse. I felt so nervous that I tried to catch F's eye and smile, trying to lighten this mood. I was also unsure if she was joking or serious, as she kept laughing intermittently throughout this. I of course wouldn't ordinarily laugh or smile at someone who was upset, but I was nervous and finding this situation very strange. 

Towards the end of the rant, F looked at me and said ""actually, you need to leave, you're pissing me off. you're frustrating me, you need to leave, I'm not even joking"". I had been sitting on the sofa through all of this speech and I was confused as we'd arranged this, and I'd travelled all the way to this house, etc. I got up to leave, as the Sister and Sister's boyfriend just sat there in silence, and I couldn't see any other way out of this. 

I got up to leave, went downstairs and put my shoes on and got my stuff together. I called up to F to ask if I could talk to her, she came down. She was still really angry with me and wouldn't really let me speak. I asked her why she was doing this, and tried to tell her that I was humiliated, but she said she 'didn't care' and that I'd humiliated her. She threatened to call the police if I didn't leave (I was already leaving) so I just laughed and said cool OK, and left. She slammed the door behind me.

Once I got home, I had a message from her telling me that we can't continue dating because the way I acted in front of her family wasn't OK. The way I'd acted seems to be referring to my mood, and not one specific thing I had done. 

We then had a phone call in which she listed everything I'd done wrong, from not greeting the sister correctly, to being rude and dismissive to her feelings during the rant she had given. I found it hard to want to comfort someone who was attacking me and humiliating me in front of people I'd just met, in a place I'd been to for the first time. I am unsure what action she would have liked me to have taken.

In this phone call she expressed that I am ""just like her ex"" in that I am rude to her family, and that her sister agrees with everything F thinks about me, and that I'm no longer welcome there, and that I should apologise to the sister and the boyfriend. That I have disrespected her family and that she can't go back on that and ever be involved with me again.

I have written everything here as it happened. I am confused and baffled as to what this is even about, why her anger exploded to that level, and what I'm supposed to do now. I am feeling quite anxious and scared, and confused at the sudden ending of the situation rather than talking about it or trying to resolve it.

I also feel like I've gone mad. I feel as if that all happened so quickly, I can't even place where the wrongdoing is. The explosion of anger I saw there was also really disconcerting. I am struggling with this because we had been very close up until just a few days ago. 

This is not the first time she exploded at me and then broke up with me - but this time is worse. I feel humiliated and confused, and I wonder who was in the wrong in this situation?

TL:DR: Girl I'm dating tells me that I disrespected her family despite it being her that stood up in front of them and ranted about me for ten minutes, while I had visited their home for the first time. I am confused and hurt and don't know who was really in the wrong."
66,"My (25F) girlfriend (24F) wants kids but is unstable.


 

My girlfriend and I (of 8 years) were talking about kids. We’d had a few drinks and this topic had come up before but the end was always that she didn’t want kids and that was okay with me. 

When we first got together I was very adamant about wanting children and a family but because she didn’t want any I was comfortable respecting her choice and expecting to be child free for the rest of my life. Anyways, tonight she was talking about having a kid and discussing the idea of it — who would be our donor/egg, who would carry, and the logistics of their raising. I let her know that I had been interested in having a family but was fine without one if she wasn’t interested. One thing behind her desires to be child free that dissuaded me from having any children is that she has a strong temper and strong anxiety. We’ve raised a puppy together and I was the main caretaker for the puppy. A lot of her interactions with our dog were freaking out (screaming) and then freaking out (screaming) in front of the puppy. It was just exhausting. 

When we were raising the puppy together i realized that children were off the table because while I loved her and could handle her temperament I didn’t want to introduce any more innocents to that. Tonight, with the conversation, I was getting hopeful. It sounded nice that she was sharing my ideal of a family and talking somewhat seriously about it, but eventually the conversation soured. I was trying to play with her and she just became nasty about it. She was calling me names and being rude and the dream suddenly faded reminding me of why I didn’t want to have children with her in the first place. 

I’m not sure what I’m here to ask, but has anyone had a partner like this before/currently and what advice would you give?

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR my girlfriend was talking about wanting kids but she turned on me afterwards and I'm concerned about bringing children into our relationship."
67,"Do I have a ""bully me"" sign attached to my back? How does one avoid being picked on?


Hi guys. I'm turning here for some opinions on a lifelong problem of mine. How to summarize this... Essentially, I feel like I'm always made out to be the laughingstock or the preferred target of the given group of people I find myself in. I'm trying to understand why this is.

Some relevant info on me: I'm 22(m) and yes, I'm socially awkward and have some anxiety issues. I honestly can't remember the time I wasn't like this. When I was just a kid, my mom used to hide my books and comics to make me play with other children. I preferred my safe bubble to the real world, which in turn made me introverted, or maybe it was the other way around. Anyhow, I got picked on like hell throughout all of my education. The other kids somehow figured out I was gay long before I did, and I got major flack for it. The bullying was first physical, then got verbal. I got labelled as that ""weird"" kid and barely had any close friends by graduation.

I thought in university, things would change. That's what everyone says, right? Well... They didn't exactly. I mean, people weren't that narrow-minded anymore. I forced myself to mingle and made some new friends. But because of my lack of social skills, I became the butt of the joke in every circle I would hang out in. People spoke over me, laughed off my opinions, wouldn't let me finish if I took too long to articulate my thoughts. They also often openly pointed out how I talked in a weird way or couldn't look people in the eyes. I became withdraw and felt pathetic like it was high school all over again.

Eventually, I stopped hanging out with these classmates because of how they were treating me. I met 22(f), who became my best friend. She was much nicer and more understanding. We're different people when it comes to our personalities, but I feel like we also complement each other. However, since getting a boyfriend, her demeanor towards me changed when hanging out between the three of us. She and her boyfriend basically team up and make jabs at my expense. Nothing major, but for example, they've made fun of my indecision and played pranks to see if I would say ""no"" when insulted or asked to do something unfair. I don't understand why they have to do that... Does my presence invite mockery? Does every dynamic between multiple people require a laughingstock, so I become that by default?

I see the same thing happening now at my first internship. The people in my division are mostly my age. They've made friends between each other, and although I've been kind and sociable towards them, one of the girls singled me out... And others basically follow her lead when she takes digs at me, which usually include weird nicknames, ""harmless"" jokes at the expense of my sexuality, or just making fun of me when I take too long to answer or express an opinion different to theirs.

I'm concerned about this pattern. Do I just happen to keep encountering bullies in my life, or am I somehow inviting verbal berating? I'm not antagonistic towards people. I always approach strangers in a friendly way, even though I may not be the best converser. However, I believe my boyfriend is the only person in my life who's never insulted me or acted as superior to me.

I'm worried and I'd like others' opinions on how it can be that people are still singling me out. Or maybe hear about someone else's practical experience with this.

tl;dr: I was bullied in school, and it seems like not much has changed since I've been in college. I'm wondering why this keeps happening to me and how I can avoid it?"
68,"Overprotective mother wont let me (17M) cross the road by myself


TLDR: My thinks that it is too dangerous for me, a 17 year old, to cross a road without traffic lights by myself. She is ridiculously controlling of my life and I need advice.

I don't know where to start, I just have so many relationship problems with my mother.

Here's some background information. I am an only child, and no I do not have any disabilities, physically or mentally.

My mother is a control freak, before my parents divorced she managed all the family's finances (even though my dad was the only one that worked) and even now I distinctively remember her being very verbally abusive towards him. In the end my dad cheated on her, and they divorced. 

My mum was understandably furious with my dad, I get it. What I don't get is how she took that anger out on me. I was only 7 back then and almost everyday she would tell me how my father is evil, and would probably kidnap and kill me if he had the chance (I'm not exaggerating, she actually told me that). Being a stupid 7 year old kid, I believed her word for word. Eventually, after a year or two of this, my dad got visiting rights and my mum had to let him see me. I was terrified of him at first, because i believed all the lies she told me. Over time I gradually realised that none of the stuff she told me was true, and that my dad, although not the best father in the world, was a good person who did care about me. Until this day I still do not forgive her for doing what she did.

Fast forward to my teenage years. she is so overprotective of me, and I'm really fucking sick of it. She thinks a lot of usual activities are dangerous, such as riding my bicycle in the bicycle lane, drinking any soft drinks cause it is bad for my health, swimming at the beach even where there's life guards on patrol, playing video games at home because I would get addicted. obviously she won't let me get my driver's license when I could have at the age of 16. One time she got super pissed at me and lectured me for an hour because she went into my room and saw that I was listening to a song called ""sex and drugs"".

So anyway here's the actual story from the title. Lately I've been feeling pretty depressed due to reasons outside of this, I'm lacking energy and the motive to do anything. In an attempt to readjust my lifestyle I wanted to start going to the gym and exercising to relief my stress. There's this gym that is a 10 minute walk from my house and the prices are affordable. I asked my mum about it and said that I would pay for it out of my own pocket with the money I saved up from my previous part time job, which she forced me to quit. She agreed to sign the paperwork (gym needs it as I'm still under 18), and today after school she picked me up, along with a friend who I was planning on going to the gym with, and drove us to the gym. 

On the way there she saw that the gym was further away than she initially thought, even though Ive already told her it was a 10 minute walk away and that's what it was. She dramatically stopped the car on the side of the road and announced that it was too dangerous for me, who is 4 months away from becoming a legal adult, to cross the road in front of the gym, a side street that didn't have pedestrian Crossing. Because of this she refused to sign the paperwork for me which was the only way for me to be allowed into the gym. 

She announced this while my friend was in the car. I did not want to argue with her with him there cause things could get ugly, so I held in the anger and stayed quiet. I was so embarrassed, for obvious reasons. I can't honestly believe that she would think that I, almost a grown man, couldn't cross a fucking road? Even worse is how my friend will think of me from now on. after we went home I told her these exact words -

Me: I don't want to talk to you.
Mum: why?
Me: I think you are mentally ill.

Then I went into my room, and she yelled out across the house that I was unappreciative and childish, as if I was in the wrong the entire time. Instead of getting into an argument I've decided to come to Reddit for advice. My mum has done a lot of good things for me, and I love her. But right now I am absolutely fucking pissed. As you probably have guess she is the most stubborn person in the world and I definitely can't persuade her about anything. The problem isn't that I cant go to the gym, I can find other ways to exercise, it's that she still treats me in the same controlling way she did 10 years ago.

Is there anyway for me to repair this relationship? Or do I just have to suck it up until I leave home (she doesn't want me to, so I have to do it against her will and become entirely financially independent while studying in university). 

I really envy those with healthy relationships with their parents.

69,"My (28F) friend is furious with me for leaving early from her (27F) birthday.


I’ll call my friend Stacey. We’ve been great friends for five or six years now, and for some reason she’s always had crappy birthdays. We’ve become really close in the last year. 

Stacey, her boyfriend, my boyfriend (I’ll call him Ben), me, and another couple went out last night for Stacey’s birthday. Stacey lives about 45 minutes from me and Ben, so Ben and I got a hotel. Stacey and her boyfriend also got a hotel and our rooms were right across the hall from each other. 

Ben and I started hanging with Stacey and her boyfriend at 5:30ish. We were getting ready, drinking, and having a great time. We met up with Other Couple at around 7:30 for dinner. We ate, we drank, we had fun. 

Ben and I got tired early. I had some food at dinner and it made my stomach feel horrible - it felt like there was a brick in the stomach. The guy part of Other Couple felt the same. 

Ben and I left at 11 and immediately fell asleep. Stacey, her boyfriend, and Other Couple kept partying until well past 2am. 

Stacey hardly spoke to me as Ben and I left. She sent me some texts that she was pretty mad I left early on her birthday. She was very, very standoffish to me this morning. The girl half of Other Couple also was texting me that Stacey had been upset. 

So... am I an asshole for leaving a party at 11pm? Should I feel horrible? What would you do?

**TL;DR: my boyfriend and I went out for our friend’s birthday. We left at 11pm and she’s really upset with me. What do I do?**"
70,"I (26F) don't know how to feel about my boyfriend's (28M) use of instagram where he pretends to be a girl


My boyfriend and I have been dating for about two years and things are pretty serious. We currently live together and have been talking about moving to the city he grew up in. That would basically entail me completely starting over somewhere I would know nobody but him. However, I have been more than happy to do this because I love him and we have a really strong relationship... or so I thought.

Last night he let me use his phone to text a mutual friend because mine had died right as I was texting. I accidentally opened instagram and here's where it gets weird. It was logged into a random account (not his ""real"" one that I follow) with a name like ""jennygirlxoxo"" or something equally cringe-worthy. 

At first glimpse, the account consisted of pictures of your typical basic white girls wearing uggs and leggings and drinking Starbucks. The inbox was FULL of messages from guys who clearly get off to this shit, and my bf is messaging back pretending to be an 18 year old girl. I saw clear evidence that guys were paying him for pictures of this girl ""Jenny"" from the legs down wearing leggings and socks or uggs. THEY WERE MY LEGGINGS, SOCKS, AND UGGS. And clearly not me wearing them, so I am assuming it is my bf taking pictures of HIMSELF wearing my clothes to send to all these dudes. What the hell?

The one conversation I did scroll a bit into was with this teenager who was confiding to Jenny about how tiny his penis is and how he is bulled at school and really appreciates Jenny's friendship. So basically, my bf is really playing into this character and creating relationships with these people in between sending them pictures of my socks on the floor. 

When I actually went to look at the pictures he has publicly posted, there's a few of me that I had no idea he had even taken. The most recent one was from the previous night where I'm laying on our bed on my stomach facing the opposite direction so it's just my ass and feet. The comments were a swarm of guys flipping out over this saying it was the best thing ""Jenny"" had ever posted and they loved how the bottoms of my white socks were dirty, and wished I was wearing uggs. WTF. My bf then responds that Jenny was wearing uggs earlier, ""don't worry"". 

Judging from what I read and saw, I feel like he is catfishing all of these people and making money off them. But why? I can't tell if he is also into this ""basic white girl"" fetish or whatever it is, but honestly would not be surprised at this point. And the money, he has a well-paying job and is eligible for promotion soon anyway so I don't get it.

I ended up just giving him his phone back and not saying anything. I'm not sure if I even want to confront him about this instagram thing. I really love him, I've totally banked on the plans we've made together, and now I feel like I don't know him as well as I thought I did because of him hiding this from me. Since I've been with him, my life has changed so much for the better and he's supported my growth into a better person. I guess I'm posting on here because I cannot imagine going to my friends about this, but any advice is appreciated! 

Is this something to pretend I never saw and let him have his privacy like as if I'd seen his internet porn history? Or would you confront a partner over this? What do you think his reason for running the account is?

tl;dr: Found out my bf is catfishing guys on instagram pretending to be an 18 year old basic white girl."
71,"My (34M) wife (29F) of 6 years wants to separate. I'm completely blindsided after we recently put down roots in a new city and had a very hard 2018.


Some context:
 - My wife always had my full trust and I'm a very cynical person. I have no suspicions that she is cheating or has cheated and I have never cheated in any way or form. We have no kids. We spend almost all our time outside of work together. We have been lucky in our careers enough to afford some luxuries and many getaways over the years. We earn about a equal salaries.

We had a rough 2018:
 - We were trying to get pregnant and failing from December to June. We knew ahead of time that she would need fertility treatment to have a real shot at conceiving and in the end her body didnt respond to the treatments in any helpful way (but we sure got all the negative side effects).
 - Our 4yr old dog was diagnosed with and died of a rare cancer. To make the dog comfortable we went through some cancer treatment that involved a lot of vet visits, time off work and money. After failing to get pregnant it really felt like we lost a child and we were emotionally drained.
 - My wife got a DUI. She recognized her inability to drive after meeting her girlfriend for drinks. She called me to pick her up, but got arrested while in the passenger seat with the car running in the bar parking lot. A lot of emotional and financial stress here as well, and this is still ongoing in court.

How she broke this to me:
 - She came to me and said that she was having doubts about our marriage. She feels that I've not been very affectionate over the last 18 months and that she feels she is doing all of the work to keep our love life together. I agree with her on this, and explain how the stress of recent events has emotionally and financially left me feeling very depressed. I agree to work on the depression issue and increase my efforts. 
 - Two weeks after that conversation(which isnt much time imo), she says that she recognizes my effort but doesn't feel any differently. She wants to start planning for separation/divorce together so that it doesn't get ugly. She reiterates all of her previous concerns and tells me how much she cares for and loves me and that she feels intense anxiety from being with me during these hard times. 

An added wrench:
 - 2 yrs ago we moved to a new city away from family and friends for her career. Bought a house there in my name only. She relies on me for transportation due to the DUI.


Should I just be focusing on preparing for a life on my own or should I try to fight to keep my marriage?
 - I'm completely stunned and I have convinced her to go to therapy with me and individually over the coming weeks to try to work things out. But the fact that she so quickly gave up has me questioning my own instinct to keep our marriage together.
- I now find it impossible to be affectionate towards her, and the thought of divorce has sent me into a hole.  What can I do to get out?

I dont feel like I can trust my own feelings at this juncture, so any input, advice or shared experience is appreciated.

TL;DR: My wife suddenly wants a divorce, I'm so blindsided that I question if I should focus on fighting to keep it together or preparing for being on my own?"
72,"My (19m) friend's (19m) brother (11m) sort of came out to me, looking for advice?


Hi Reddit, I'm posting here today because I've found myself in a situation for which I feel unqualified. Hoping to get some helpful input.

I'll call my friend's little brother ""Noah"" because that's a random name that popped up in my head. Since I've started hanging out with my friend and coming over to his house, I've noticed Noah was shy but nevertheless attention-seeking like most kids. His older brother was always weirdly annoyed by Noah and would shoo him away if he tried to participate in whatever we were doing. I thought that was often an unnecessarily dickish move, so this one time I stood up for the kid and said he could stay (we were playing a video game). Since then, Noah has been clinging on me whenever I'm around, telling me random stories from school or sharing his thoughts. I don't mind at all, I think it's kind of adorable.

The other day I came to my friend's house to hang out and maybe go out later, but he was late due to pulling an extra hour at work. So I waited in the living room and played around on my phone. After awhile Noah came down from his bedroom and he seemed happy to see me. He took interest in the mobile game I was playing, then started babbling about school like usual. In the middle of the conversation, he just dropped the following: ""...and you know about Jacob? I think I really like him."" Jacob is a classmate of Noah's, if I remember correctly. At first I thought he meant as a friend, but he explained very non-chalantly this was a crush (it's all pretty innocent, he wants to hold the other kid's hand and watch a movie together). I was a little taken aback but kept it cool, and tried to find out if he'd told anyone else. He said no, and asked me if I thought his brother would find that weird. I said he wouldn't because it's not weird at all (I know my friend and he's not homophobic). Noah agreed but still asked me to keep this a secret.

Obviously, I won't go around telling anything to my friend or his parents, I'm mainly wondering if there's anything else I should've said to Noah? Or should I just drop the subject of his crush unless he brings it up again? I'm overanalyzing because I've never had a kid kind-of-sort-of come out to me and I feel like this is a sensitive subject.

Tl;dr Friend's little brother randomly told me about his crush on a male classmate the other day. Curious to find out if my reaction was fine and if I should add anything to it? I'm pretty inexperienced with this stuff."
73,"My [21F] boyfriend’s [23M] best friend’s girlfriend tells him intimate details about what she likes during sex. I feel uncomfortable.


So, my boyfriend had two close friends, a guy and a girl, who he set up together. Now they have been dating for a few months. 

I’ve never met either of these people so I can’t judge but there are some weird things going on, and I don’t know if I’m just being sensitive. 

First of all, this best friend’s girlfriend texts my boyfriend all the time. Which isn’t that odd, seeing as they were originally friends. But my boyfriend says he always feels like he has to tell his friend when they text or hang out together, just to be polite. 

Secondly, he told me that she’s going to ‘hate me’ when she firsts meets me. I asked why. He said firstly because I was prettier - he showed her a picture from my social media before our first date and she coached him on what to say to me, what questions to ask etc. 

Then, secondly, he said that she always gets ‘a bit protective or jealous’ if he’s hooking up with or dating a new girl. This made me a bit concerned because she’s meant to be in a happy relationship. I don’t see why she would get jealous of a girl dating her friend unless she had feelings for him that she wasn’t being honest about. 

But the thing that really alarmed me was her messages and general conversation about what she likes in bed. She asked him after we first slept together if I was any good, and without revealing to much, my boyfriend essentially said he was surprised by what I was into and didn’t expect it from me etc. 

Which prompted this girl to start discussing explicitly what she likes during sex. Almost trying to one up me? Saying that she loved being called bad names and being ‘abused’, slapped etc. 

This is what I’m worried about. Because, as a female, I would never explicitly reveal what I liked in bed unless I thought I had a shot with him, and was essentially trying to turn him on or be suggestive. Is that just me? 

I don’t really know if it’s my place to say anything, or whether this is just what a close friendship between different sexes looks like and I haven’t experienced it yet. Any and all advice welcome please!!

Tl;Dr - my boyfriend’s best friend’s girlfriend tells him intimate details about what she likes during sex etc. I feel weird but maybe I am being too sensitive? "
74,"I 29F Registered nurse married to 38M who constantly insults my intelligence as a nurse.


I have been married to my husband for about a year, together for 3.

Anyways, I have been an oncology nurse for about 6 years. I have made a few mistakes in my career, as does everyone, and by mistakes I just mean complaints involving the way I put in an IV or bedside manner. Nothing catastrophic, pretty generic. 

My husband has constantly told me, whenever I have any small piece of medical advice or offer to bandage up someone, that I am a ""terrible nurse"" and ""no wonder people dont like me"" 

My husbands mom recently underwent pretty major surgery. I noticed in photos that there was a pretty large infection on some of her sutures and asked my husband if I could go over and take a look. He told me no, because he is a lot more competent then me, and can be a better nurse without a degree then I ever could. 

I can accept criticism, and my husband is in no way and has never been in the medical field. And having my intelligence/career/degree insulted is incredibly demeaning and hurts me so much. 

Right now, this isn't any sort of deal breaker to end my marriage. So I would like ideas on how to tackle this issue without the threat of ending the relationship. 

TLDR: Husband thinks I am a terrible nurse, and constantly insults my intelligence."
75,"Why do I [27F] feel so unsafe around my husband? [29M]


We've been together for three years and up until three months ago, I was happy. It wasn't until we got engaged that I started experiencing heightened anxiety, vision problems, and dissociation.  And it hasn't left since. I stayed with my in-laws on and off these past few months and 80% of these physical symptoms went away. I felt *safe* in their home, but I don't feel safe in my own. I would wake up at their house and have an appetite whereas here I wake up and either feel nauseous because I have to trudge through another day, or the thought of eating gives me anxiety. At their house I was open and willing to go places whereas I worry if I go somewhere with my husband I'll either pass out from the dissociation or something else. 

If it helps, he's gone all day at work and the weather is terrible. I don't have friends, a car, or a job because I'm waiting on my sponsorship to come through. In the meantime I wish I could just live with his parents 4 hours away. I know it's not possible, but I hate being here. What is the solution?

TLDR: Emotionally I love my husband but physically I'm more stressed than ever. I feel safer around his parents. What do I do?"
76,"My autistic friend (25 M) is judgemental, cruel, and difficult to spend time with. Should I cut him out of my life or is that unfair because it's not his fault due to his condition?


&amp;#x200B;

There's one guy in my circle of friends who is constantly critical, judgemental, and mean. He often brings up my weight and calls everyone ""bitch"". One of his issues is that he can only really communicate in the form of an argument; he is always trying to argue with somebody over something.

I feel bad for him because we are his only friends, but he is seriously effecting my mental health. Every time we bring him along I end up feeling deflated and humiliated. Is it wrong for me to stop spending time with him and ignore him outright, even though this may cause him to be severely lonely and lose all of his social interactions? All of his other friends have done the same.

I know that it is not his fault because he has a disorder. I'm not sure what to do. I feel like raising the issue with him would lead to another ""argument"". Am i wrong to want to separate myself?

77,"My wife [24f] wanted a ridiculously overpriced SUV. I [28m] got it for her but she keeps damaging it and costing more money, and it's causing fights.


Okay, so I love my wife dearly. She's a great girl and I'm happy to be with her (together four years and married 9 mos., BTW).

At the time we got married, she was driving an old beater that tended to leave her stranded alot. I wanted to get her something better and was in a good financial spot, so I asked her to pick out a vehicle she really wants and I'd get it for her.

She *immediately* told me she wanted the (absolutely atrocious, imo) Cadillac Escalade. Her dad drove one and she has apparently wanted one of those things since she was a teenager, for some reason I don't understand.

At any rate, I work in an automotive-related industry and made some calls. I found a friend who had a recent year Escalade and understandably wanted rid of it, and was willing to sell it to me for a reduced (but still fucking expensive) price.

I told Alex (my wife) I'd get it for her if that is really what she wants, but beyond that I would not work on it, drive it, or ride in it if it could be helped. She agreed, and I bought the stupid thing.

Since then she has managed to scrape the paint on various things multiple times. She has backed into stationary objects four times, necessitating light replacements and expensive body work. She burned out the parking brake by forgetting to take it off and heading out on the highway twice. The first time she literally had to call me and tell me her SUV wasn't accelerating well, and it took me asking if the parking brake was off before she even noticed.

Each time, I have either fixed it myself or paid good money to get it fixed, because she really does love that SUV and I do want her to be happy.

But the last straw was today when she came home and immediately began acting very lovey and touchy, which I've come to associate with her needing something done on that vehicle.

This time she curb checked it and it needs new rims. I was kind of at my Whit's end and told her I am ready to sell that thing as soon as possible because I'm sick of wasting money on it. This caused a mild fight as she doesn't want the suv she loves so much getting sold and she has been acting pouty about it since then.

Now what? I can't keep dropping money on the damned Escalade, I also don't want to rip away one of my wife's prize possessions (though I don't for the life of my understand why someone would prize that thing). Help me out a bit?

And I do want to say, I feel like my wife comes across as maybe bratty and materialistic in this post, but other than her terrible taste in vehicles, she really is a great wife and is very kind and thoughtful, we're just really having a disagreement about the stupid Escalade.

**TL;DR**:Wife wanted an Escalade for some reason. Got her an Escalade, for some reason. She keeps damaging it and costing money. I want to sell it, she wants to keep it (and keep fixing it), what to do?"
78,"Fiancée [m29] is disappointed that I [f28] can't satisfy his evolving sexual desires


My thoughts are jumbled rn so please forgive me if my post is a bit unclear.

We have been together for 3 years. When we met he stated that he was very into vanilla sex and vanilla porn. Lately, his interests have evolved and he blames my lack of interest on me being scared/juvenile/etc. He will make comments stating that I am a starfish or comments that remind me how I'm not satisfying him enough.

He's made comments about hardcore porn, threesomes, and also about how he's interested in ""how much I can receive"". When these comments upset me (because I'm not there yet!), he gaslights me! It's a constant reminder that we are no longer sexually compatible...

Recently, he was suggesting things he could insert into me and I really didn't want to go there at 630am while getting ready for work. When I played the game of ""anything you are comfortable with me sticking in you, can be stuck in me,"" he didn't like it because I am ""made"" to receive things. I reminded him that I am not subject to his idea of societal gender norms to which he replied ""you won't respect me if you stick things in me."" Wtf? So I'm his toy to do with what he wants because I was made for it, but he's excluded because he's determined that I won't respect him? I don't think so.  I feel as if this is a symptom of watching hardcore porn, but I could be wrong.

I am worried that our relationship is deteriorating because now we have different wants/needs.  It's hard to talk about with him because I have been damaged sexually and he is a psychology student, who is very good at knowing what someone is thinking. Since he knows ""my answer"" before I am able to come to my own conclusion, I spend a lot of time defending myself from what thinks I am doing/saying.

Yes, he is more sexually mature than I am as I have had men do some terrible things to me, without my consent.  I am in therapy now and plan to address these issues when I am ready to.

I'll admit, we could have more sex and maybe that would help. However, he will complain when I am not super into it! He not only wants more sex from me, he wants me to match his sex drive.

Has anyone successfully addressed this type of issue? If so, how did you go about it? Is your relationship healthier now for it?

Tldr;
Fiancée's sex interests have evolved and I feel like a disappointment because my interests have remained stagnent.  The relationship seems to be deteriorating."
79,"I (24M) love my girlfriend (24F) but her poor hygiene is really bothering me


I've been dating my girlfriend for almost a year now and everything has been great. We get along really well, have the same interests, and genuinely enjoy spending time together. However, lately there has been something really bothering me related to her poor hygiene. Her vagina smells almost like fish (don't know how else to describe it) and during oral sex the odor makes me gag. I've honestly never smelled anything that bad in my entire life. In addition to this I don't think she cleans herself after defecating. There have been a few times where I can smell feces while going down on her but haven't actually visibly seen it. I don't even know how to broach the topic. This wasn't a problem when we first started dating but has been an issue for the last few months. What should I do?

80,"(28F) Very disturbed after finding out my husband (29M) of a year has a secret life, please help.


Using my throwaway due to a couple friends knowing my main account.

Husband and I both have iphones, I use the cloud but he doesn't. I don't know what happened exactly but I guess from some change in his settings, I noticed his phone had synced to the cloud for the first time today. 

There was a weird document from the ""notes"" app in his files. It turned out to be a running journal of sorts, filled with records of his activities in spying on various people. His phone had backed up a bunch of past versions of the document as he edited it, so I got to see how this has been going on for at least several months. 

Each time seemed to follow a pattern, he'd leave the house at a time when I was at work and he was off (he had every date/time noted down), then he makes his way around our neighborhood. He's been doing this maybe once a week. We live in an area of a city where it's mixed residential and commercial. He had addresses recorded that I believe are all residential. He seems to know exactly who lives at each place (some even by name), notes how many apartments/condos are at each, what cars are there, what pets, and the different access points like ""front door to shared entrance hall"", ""side door to 1st floor"", ""fire escape to 2nd floor window"", ""back 1st floor window always unlocked"", ""basement bulkhead lock combo is xxxx"".....

He has been keeping notes on everything he sees people doing in their houses. He's recorded bits of conversations. He speculates in this journal what people's relationships to each other are, and tries to find out who other people are that he hears them talking about. There were mentions of pictures he'd took, his photo gallery also ended up in the cloud so I snooped that too and saw a ton of snapshots taken both through windows AND INSIDE people's homes!!! Until this I'd half believed it was just creative writing. I saw people having sex, and both men and women naked or in their bathrooms. There were kids (not naked) in some photos too so I don't know if that counts as CP or what. 

The most disturbing thing to me is there was an entry where he described the types of HIDDEN CAMERAS he bought off the internet, then a list of all the locations he put them. He purposely planted cameras in some people's houses to spy on them remotely from his computer!!

I am so, so, creeped out by this. I feel like I have no fucking idea who he is now! Who does something like that? I honestly don't think I could possibly think of him in the same way. Now I'm almost afraid of him. He's said a couple times that he used to think about becoming a private investigator but I don't see how that would make it any more okay. That's a job, not a hobby you just do to random people.

Before you ask, yes he's always been kind of odd, but nothing to give me a suspicion he had this other life. I mean odd like very reserved, the brooding quiet type. Which I am a bit myself so it worked. He has never mistreated me or anyone else.

I've built a life with him. This feels like as much a betrayal as if he'd cheated.

I don't know if I should proceed with a divorce over this, or should require he stops and stay with him if he does. One thing I know for certain is I do not want to be married to a man who I know is illegally creeping around. Is this something that's past the point of second chances? How far should forgiveness go?

Please help guide me in what decision to make here, what would you do in this situation??

(I have not brought it up yet. I've been avoiding him tonight saying I feel sick but can't keep that up forever, I have to talk to him soon.)

tl;dr: My husband has been leading a secret life behind my back involving spying on neighbors, possibly coming from his childhood dream of being a private investigator. He keeps detailed notes on everything he finds out about these people and what he sees and hears when he hides in their homes. It's gone so far as him putting cameras in their homes. Extremely upset after reading all this."
81,"[24F] have two roommates [24F &amp; 22F]. They share a hobby: singing....except one of them sounds like a dying cat.


So, this isn’t as serious as most of the posts here but as you can tell from the title, I’ve got myself a musical problem on my hands. Basically I’ve been living with two girls for about a year now. We have a pretty good relationship and I’d consider us all friends. We have one, very loud, very tone deaf problem.


Roommate [22F] is a semi professional acoustic singer. She records, plays an instrument, performs in front of live audiences for cash. She’s good! Occasionally she practices in the house, but it’s pleasant enough and rare enough to not be distracting, never more than an hour or two at a time when others are home (our walls are thin). She makes a point to tell us to let her know if we need quiet time. Overall it’s great, I get to hear someone talented perform their own music for free! We can call her Leia.

Roommate [24F] has pegged her new hobby as....singing! I’m happy that she’s found something she likes, but I am slowly losing my grip on reality when I hear her turn the music up in her room. She sings along with base-y pop songs, at the top of her lungs, in a voice that sounds like a cat in the process of being brutally maimed. She picks one song for an evening and belts it out over and over. It don’t sound good y’all. Do you remember middle school choir? I’m living permanently inside of one. I’m starting to develop a physical rash from second hand embarrassment. Nobody should be singing Whitney Houston like that without being fined by federal law enforcement. My only reprieve is blasting music in the bathroom and trying to drown her out while I shower. I cannot keep running up the water bill like this.  (We can call her June.)

When it first started, I tried gently asking if she was going to go take lessons or find a local choir to practice with. She said no, that she just wanted it as a fun hobby after work. I’ll clarify that she isn’t doing it late at night so it’s not interfering with my basic functions, but I. Am. Struggling. I can hear it in my room. I can hear it in the kitchen. I can hear it with the TV on. I CAN HEAR IT FROM OUTSIDE ON THE BACK PATIO. I have no escape and it is getting dark.

So, I’m kinda at a loss of what to do. The reason I bring up both roommates, is because I’m afraid if I ask June to tone it down, she will inevitably ask why I haven’t said the same the Leia. I don’t want to crush her feelings by saying I would rather step on legos than listen to her sing Ariana Grande ever again. Is it ok for ME to be ok with one roommate singing and not the other? I don’t know. 

How do I tell someone they aren’t good at their hobby and that they need to either be quieter or get a vocal chord transplant, because I feel like I’m being audibly assaulted in my own home. Should I have to wear earplugs for two to three hours every day after work? That’s a high expectation, even for a roommate situation. It’s my house too and I deserve to relax. I can tolerate an hour, but past that is when I start wondering why god has abandoned me. 

June is pretty sensitive and I see this going south fast. She’s told me part of her self-identity  in her formative years was being a church choir girl, and that she thinks she’s pretty good. I have a bad feeling that saying the wrong thing will really make her feel bad about herself....but she’s gotta hear it. After all, she’s not hearing herself, that’s for sure.

TL;DR: my roommate who insists on singing every day for two to three hours has the vocal range of a teaspoon, and I need to successfully navigate telling her to please tone it down. Help me before I have to start a Gofundme for my ears."
