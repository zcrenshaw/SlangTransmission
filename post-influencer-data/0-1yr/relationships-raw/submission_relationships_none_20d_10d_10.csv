0,"My (30F) husband (32M) impulse bought a dog. [update]


Update to https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/cmu75w/my_30f_husband_32m_impulse_bought_a_dog/

Thank you all for the thorough responses. I read every comment you guys sent.

A few months ago I read a post where a woman sat down with her husband and outlined everything she takes care of at home in a list format. Like, kitchen: trash, dishes, wipe counters down. Etc. That way of communicating really stuck with me and when we went to see our therapist, I used the same format to express how much I do for the dog.

My husband told me that owning a dog was a joint effort and since I’m home all day it shouldn’t be a problem.

Which is when I realized that has been his excuse for everything. Cooking, chores, cleaning. I’m not sure how I became blind to it. I don’t know when I started bending over backwards to accommodate him.

We used to be a solid couple who helped each other out. I remember when I was still in school he’d come over to my apartment and clean the whole thing for me during finals. Or he took care of my elderly cat when I was away for a week and a half. He used to help me dry the dishes and it was always fun. We used to have so much fun and laugh all the time. At some point it all stopped.

I started crying right there in the middle of a sentence and he got concerned. I’m not a cryer the only time he’s ever seen me cry was when I had to put my beloved cat down a few years ago. But he held me for the first time in what felt like months and we had a serious heart to heart about how he made me feel. Not only with the dog but how stressed I’ve been with my job, how lonely I am, I don’t feel important and how we don’t feel like a team anymore, that I’m worried about us.

I guess it clicked for him because he really stepped up taking care of the dog. He started going into work earlier so he can come home early and hang out and make me dinner. It happened slowly over the course of the last few weeks and the routine suits us a lot better. We hired a trainer to make sure we can understand the dog’s boundaries together and the dog sleeps in a dog bed. Our bedroom life has slowly gotten back to where it was when we got married. We’re watching our favorite shows again and going out more. I’ve been putting my foot down more about my feelings and he has been receptive. We are still going to therapy for now. 

As for the dog, we’re going to keep him. Is he a No List dog? Yes. But is he a good puppy with a big heart? Yes. We have the money to afford him and he took off after training. It’s nice having a dog again.

TL;DR: husband and I went to therapy, we talked through our problems, we are giving our marriage the time and attention it needs to mend. We’re keeping the dog."
1,"UPDATE: I [24F] am at the end of my rope with my wife [27F].


Hello, everyone.

[I wrote here two months ago about my relationship with my wife.](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/c3ms1o/i_24f_am_at_the_end_of_my_rope_with_my_wife_27f/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app) She was a hoarder and had a litany of other issues that were above my pay grade. I asked Reddit if I should leave by July 1, and it was unanimous that I absolutely should.

I didn’t leave July 1.

I left the night of June 30.

The cleaning didn’t get done, surprising literally no one. We were driving to our apartment and I told her that I was really crestfallen about July 1.

“Why? Is that a bad date for you or something?”

I was furious, but kept it to myself. I told her how I felt, and I reminded her of my deadline. I told her that I was moving out and that I was done.

She cried and cried and cried, and begged for a week to clean the apartment to “show that she was committed to this marriage”. I said that she was free to do it, but I wasn’t going to sleep there during that, and I moved in with my friend. We agreed to reassess the condition of the apartment Sunday morning. 

She told me how spiritually edifying it was to clean. I was really optimistic for a bit. 

Wednesday comes and my FIL calls me, frantic. He’s like a dad to me. He tells me that my wife emailed him (which she never talks to him unless she has to), and I asked why. He told me that she begged him to tell me to ‘come back home’. He remarked that it was bizarre, but I was incensed. “No, FIL, it’s not bizarre, it’s shitty. She’s trying to leverage you though our relationship to get me back.”

Saturday comes and she sends me a message on Facebook saying “you know, it doesn’t look as good as I wanted it to physically, but I feel like I’ve made a lot of progress emotionally and *isn’t that what matters?*”

I told her that such progress would have been appreciated two years ago, but I had to walk- I couldn’t do it any more.

She spent money online with our card without informing me on yarn and we had a disagreement about it. I told her that I wanted the bank account closed, but she “couldn’t bear to see me in person”. I redirected my checks to a new account instead.

It had been weeks and I finally went back to get my things and it got a lot worse. There was a water leak in the carpet, the litter boxes weren’t taken care of since I took care of them the day I left, and she managed to move the microwave into her bedroom. The latter was particularly surprising because she refused to move anything heavier than 10 lbs because of a cited rotator cuff injury for years and yet got a 40 lbs microwave into her room.

I reported the conditions to my MIL, who co-signed the lease with us. She called me back to bemoan “what am I going to do about my daughter? You don’t understand how hard it is to have to think about how to take care of her!”

I snapped at MIL about her nonsense. She asked me what she should do about my ex-wife, feeding her histrionic personality. I told her that I had no idea, but she signed papers 27 years ago that made it her responsibility and not mine.

I’m happily living with my friend. Her and I are currently figuring out what we are, but we’re being supportive of each other and making each other lives easier. We both just celebrated birthdays (happy quarter-century!) and that was perfect. 

I’ve been told that my ex-wife has had a much more rigid and stoic affect since I left. MIL told me that she didn’t even say she missed me. “It’d be nice if she came back.”

I heard from FIL that they’re mad that the car I have is in my name; it was given to me as a graduation present, and was an old family car.

I start my new job tomorrow. I’ve been getting ready all last week and I am so nervous but so excited.

I’m really glad I left.

TL;DR: My wife begged me for her last second chance, still didn’t do anything. Tried to get her dad to bend my arm to come back. She wrecked the apartment even more since I left, so I notified MIL. MIL is more concerned about herself than her daughter. I’m happy with my friend and I start my big girl job tomorrow, and thank God."
2,"Update: SO[35M] and I[35F] were going under financially. I got a credit card to float us until we got it fixed. It's fixed. I don't know how to tell him what I did though.


My previous post: https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/crz1y1/so35m_and_i35f_were_going_under_financially_i_got/

Before I begin, a few clarifications:

About a year after I moved in with him, he asked me to be a stay at home mom type deal.  He offered to support me in exchange for me making sure his kid got to and from school safely, that he didn't have to pay for babysitters/child care on school holidays, early releases, and summers, etc.  His kid is about at an age now where they can be alone for a little bit at a time so I am looking for work now, but haven't found anything yet.  The card was in his name.  I did do a shitty thing.

He had absolutely nothing to do with any part of our finances, he didn't want to.  He said, ""I trust you to take care of us"" and that's where all of my anxiety came from.  He trusted me on many levels and I betrayed that trust multiple times.  Well intentioned, but nonetheless.

""How did he not realize where the money was coming from?""  As long as everything was paid for, and we had no late fees or bank overdrafts, he didn't notice or care.  It was my job to make that magic happen.  The card was almost exclusively used for groceries and gas for our only vehicle.  I do all of the shopping and cooking and cleaning and he never really ever examined our bank statements.  There was a time where we were trying to figure out how to pay for some oil to do an oil change and he questioned how I was able to find money for this thing or that, and I just told him careful juggling.

With all of that said - I came clean last night.  I had been trying all week to talk to him about it but every time I tried to find  the words, I would start hyperventilating.   In the end I chickened out, and wrote him a letter.  I explained absolutely every detail.  I asked him to read it and I sat nearby while he did.

I really, truly, genuinely believed he would be livid.  In my head I heard him saying ""this is a dealbreaker.""  But instead he gave me a hug and said that it's okay, and we will fix it.  We sat down together and paid the bill in full, so it's gone.  Then we spent a couple of hours just reviewing all of our finances and creating a budget together.  Something we should have done long ago.

I've learned many valuable lessons here.  I still feel like shit, as I probably should, and I probably will for awhile. But, it's done, and we can move forward with a clean slate and that is a relief.

I just wanted to say thank you to everyone who offered encouragement. 

--- 
 

tl:dr; we fixed it and I greatly appreciate all of the suggestions, criticisms, and encouragements."
3,"UPDATE on 28F dating 26M for 3 months—is it time for the ""serious relationship"" talk?


A few days ago, I wrote about [bringing up the ""serious relationship"" conversation after 3 months of dating exclusively](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/cu5bdw/28f_dating_26m_for_3_monthsis_it_time_for_the/). I finally got a chance to talk to him.

We were initially going to have this conversation right before my work trip at the end of the week, but yesterday at work, it was bothering me, so I decided to see if we could chat earlier instead. I had thought about this a lot during the past weekend, and realized that *I didn't care* about his answer anymore, just that I wanted one so I could move on with my life. Especially with the next couple of weeks coming up at work (we are preparing for some high-level events), I didn't want any distractions. 

He was very receptive to the conversation, apologized that he had made me feel the way I did, but ultimately said that he was figuring things out personally and wasn't ready for a serious relationship. That was a red flag to me, and with how well but busy my job (and life, in general) is going, I couldn't afford this kind of uncertainty. I certainly don't have the time and emotional capital for it. So ultimately we just decided to end it. It was all very amicable. 

Honestly, I'm relieved, which just goes to show we made the right decision.

Thank you to everyone who were kind enough to take time to share their thoughts and suggested ways forward. It was extremely helpful and contributed to this ending well. I really appreciate it. I'm more discerning about these things moving forward.

**TL;DR** We had the conversation, but decided to part ways. It was all amicable."
4,"I just found out my mom (51) takes antidepressants after denying my (18F) mental health issues for years TL;DR At the bottom


For years, my mother and I have had a very difficult and strained relationship. There’s many many reasons for this, but that’s a story for another time. 


For some background: I’ve always struggled with depression and anxiety and it went undiagnosed for years and I was just getting worse and worse (3 attempts, 1 hospitalization). Since I was 13, my parents took me to therapists but they never worked bc they were “family therapist” and weren’t a good fit. Finally when I was 16, we found a therapist that was a good fit and was helping but my mom denied my diagnosis of MDD ( Major Depressive Disorder).


Last year (May 2018) was my third attempt, and I ended up being hospitalized. My mom only came to visit me in the hospital ONCE the 10 days I was there and ended up leaving early bc she made me cry yelling at me that this is all fake and I shouldn’t be in the hospital, that I ruined everything for our family and she’s embarrassed to tell the rest of our family what had happened (????) She had been complaining to my therapist that I did it all for attention and that the hospital was too far for her to come see me.* 


*The hospital was in Amityville, NY and we live in Queens, NY. They also had visiting twice a day and on weekends it was almost 2 hours of visiting*


When she did have to come into the hospital to meet the doctors she just sat there and cried her eyes out about it was all her fault and that she’s so sorry she’s a horrible mom. She somehow made it all about her and once I got out the hospital she never spoke of it again and never asked how I am or if I continued with therapy, literally NOTHING. 


So today I’m looking for nail polish remover and I go into her room and she the bottle of Paroxetine. The name sounds familiar so I google it and low and behold it’s an SSRI that treats depression, anxiety, OCD, PMS and a multitude of other things. 


I feel so hurt and angry because for so long I have been made to felt like I was crazy by her and that what I went through wasn’t serious or even mattered. I don’t even know what to do, I don’t know if talking to her would even work bc she usually explodes and I know my dad will probably just try and minimize what I feel, so what should I do? 

TL;DR- mom denied diagnosis from psychiatrist and therapists even after 3 suicide attempts but now takes antidepressants. Don’t know what to do"
5,"I [25F] said something really stupid to my GF [24F] by accident, now she doesn't believe I didn't mean it


Ok so I'm a dumbass. She's actually my first relationship and the first person I had sex with ever, and we are like ridiculously sexually compatible. We've been dating for 5 months now but we knew each other for 2 years as friends before that, and had already developed feelings for each other for a long while. So it definitely feels quite serious already.

Basically we were having sex, actually just got finished, and I just wanted to express how good it was, yknow? So I said 'babe, you're so good you're gonna ruin everybody else for me'. Basically unintentionally saying I'll definitely have sex with other people after her. big oof

Like 1 millisecond after saying it my brain went 'wait.. hold on a sec.. that doesn't sound right' and she was already looking at me weirdly... she said 'wow way to ruin the moment' and then kinda tried to laugh it off and I apologized a thousand times and explained I didn't mean it that way. She tried to just laugh along and play it off like she isn't bothered but she's not a very good actress and I know she's hurt. How do I make up for saying dumb stuff I didn't actually mean that way?

\_\_\_

\*\*tl,dr:\*\* I said something stupid to my GF after sex and it ruined the moment and hurt her. How can I make things better and make her believe me?"
6,"Me [34 M] with my new GF [35/F] of all of a week, how do I bring up hygiene?


This is a really weird situation and I'm turning to Reddit because I don't want to ask my friends about it and affect their perception of her.

I have only been official with my new girlfriend for a week, and I want to nip this in the bud but it's an awkward conversation to have with someone in their mid 30s so I wanted to ask advice of people on here.

I've been dating her for several weeks, and this was never an issue, but since we became official and exclusive a  week ago it's been continuous and my hints are ignored. 

She is intelligent, attractive, creative, kind, and an independent business owner who works with many different clients every day. But my new GF doesn't shower regularly or regularly brush her teeth. We live in a hot area and I can smell her from across the table in restaurants, and it's quickly making me less attracted to her- not just the smell and her greasy hair, but the fact that I have to tell this to a 35 year old. I was so happy and excited while dating her, so this is a huge letdown.


I have seen her four times this week, and it has gotten worse each time. She is busy, but not busy enough to not take a shower at night or brush her teeth, especially when we meet very close to her home (we both live in Central locations in our city anyway). At the beginning of the week we were very cuddly and close, but every time I met up with her she smelled worse and tonight I didn't even want to touch her.


Tonight was the point that I realized that it wasn't a one-off thing. She wanted to meet me straight after work at 5, but since it was boiling hot today and I wanted to shower myself, I asked if we could meet at 7 so we could both shower and get ready, using those specific words. We met very close to her home. She hadn't even gone home and had just hung out with her friends for a few hours at a cafe. Shs said she doesn't want to go home after work because then it's too hard to go out again. She smelled so bad at the restaurant that I was embarrassed to be sitting with her.

I finally asked her to shower at my house later that night, strongly hinting that she must surely want to because it was so hot, and talking about how I always had to shower multiple times a day to avoid being gross in the heat. She did, but refused to wash her hair because she said she gets headaches if she has wet hair at night (which I think is a fictional belief of Chinese medicine?). So her hair was still greasy and stinky and I couldn't cuddle with her.

She asked what was wrong, and I just told her I was tired and ended the date at 11 instead of asking her to stay overnight. Writing these words, I feel like this situation is pretty ridiculous and I should break it off. But I want to hear other people's opinions on the matter, as I don't want to ruin a relationship with someone who I really like without at least making an attempt to save it.

I should add that she isn't depressed, we talk about feelings and emotions and mental health a lot and she's cheerful and upbeat. And she totally put in the effort while we were dating before (about 3 weeks), though we always met up only on weekends.

Tldr my new GF goes days without showering or brushing her teeth, and I don't know how to bring it up delicately."
7,"UPDATE: My girlfriend's [23F] family is threatening to kick her out if she doesn't break up with me! [26M]


A few weeks ago I [wrote about how controlling my girlfriend's parents can be](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/ckl34j/my_girlfriends_23f_family_is_threatening_to_kick/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x). Basically they said if she continued to date me she would get kicked out. So we decided to just keep our relationship under the radar from them. A few days before her recent family vacation with her parents and brother, her and I were in a very good place. However, during the vacation, her and her mom got into an argument that I don't know the details about yet, but she basically told me that she doesn't think she can keep lying to her parents for 2 more years until she moves out. This basically sounded like it meant the end of our relationship and this reoccurring issue is starting to leave a sour taste in my mouth. 

I still haven't seen her since she left on vacation but we've been texting saying that we need to talk things out. Lately, she has been incredibly clingy over text, she usually isn't at all but i guess its because of the fact that our relationship might end, and its her first ever relationship. Last night she texted me saying: ""Idk I feel conflicted and you can’t fix this. All I can say is if you love me enough you will either wait for me or we will get back together when we have things right. If you really love me we will find a way back to each other but idk""

If it were up to me I would stay in the relationship currently, provided the parent issue doesn't keep reoccurring, but it seems like that won't be the case. It kinda upset me that she used wording like ""if you love me you'll wait"", it came off pretty manipulative, and she's not naturally a manipulative person. If she was asking me to wait 6 months or so then sure no problem. However she's asking me to wait 2 years just for the possibility of us getting back together. I dont know if this sounds selfish, but im 26 and I've been in a relationship for most of my 20s. I don't really have any interest in just waiting it out for the next 2 years. What would you guys do?

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR: Girlfriend doesn't wanna lie about us to her parents anymore which basically means we have to break up. She now wants me to wait for 2 years until she is able to move out and pursue the relationship."
8,"My [33F] husband [38M] has been cheating on me while the kids [5F, 2M] were in the house


I just uncovered all of this a few hours ago and I am still a wreck so my apologies if this sounds incoherent. 

We have 2 small children together, 8 years of marriage, a house and a dog. The perfect life until today. We are both working full time and I am also taking some online courses for my Masters degree. Due to my job, I am taking business trips every month for 2-3 days at a time. It was my homework for the Masters that caused me to use my husband’s computer today since my laptop was at work. Some might say that I invaded his privacy and I should’ve asked for permission but he was at work and I honestly didn’t think he’d be upset if I did my homework on his PC. I go into his office, sit down, and start doing my thing. The computer is one of those Apple desktops and it seems like his phone was connected to it still because I kept seeing notifications from iMessages. Curiosity got the best of me since they were so many and interfering with my concentration, so I opened the app. My world shattered in seconds. As I was reading through the conversation, they were chatting still. It was clear that the person was a female and that they were very very comfortable with each other. 

I don’t have the patience to write out everything I read in there but I’ll summarize it. I have found out that they started this at least 1.5 years ago. They have been exchanging explicit pictures, sometimes taken within a few feet of me or our children. He met her while in the park with our kids. She frequently visited our home while I was on my business trips and our children were asleep. Pardon my language but my husband fucked this girl in our house, on our bed, with our kids sleeping on the other side of the wall. This woman is young, maybe 25 years old. It comes as no surprise though since my husband keeps very fit and is quite handsome and charming. He has a folder in the computer with pictures and videos they took in our bedroom, living room and bathroom. 

I left the house and I’m currently at my sister’s. I don’t know what to do and I haven’t made a decision yet but I cannot sleep with him in that bed anymore. The kids are at home. I told him it’s an impromptu business trip so I wouldn’t be surprised if he invited that girl over. I’m at a loss. What do I do?

TL;DR: my husband cheated. Brought his girlfriend over into our house while the kids were at home"
9,"My parents (50s) went through my room and “organized” everything. I (21F) had a breakdown and now they want me to move out.


To provide some background, I have always been a disorganized person. I don’t like it because the mess stresses me out, but due to ADHD and probably depression (my parents don’t know about my mental health nor will I ever be able to speak to them about it) I have a hard time feeling motivated or productive. That being said, my room isn’t disgusting. The main issue are a perpetual basket of laundry and some scattered piles of whatever I didn’t put away for the last couple weeks on my desk. No food, cups, trash. 

Yesterday, because of some house painting, I had to push everything into the middle of my room, and empty my cabinets. I told my parents I would deal with putting everything away and cleaning up when I get home. 

When I got home, my room was completely cleaned. My furniture was pushed back, my desk was spotless, my cabinets were reorganized and one of my cabinets were actually gone. My laundry was gone. 

I don’t know what came over me but I started crying and hyperventilating. Looking through my cabinets and not being able to find anything. Everything from my desk was missing. My whole collection of books gone, which I was most pissed off about. I felt so violated picturing my parents going through all my stuff, sorting, throwing things out, touching my dirty laundry. I know my things appeared messy but I knew where everything was, it truly isn’t that bad, and I was planning on cleaning up.

I pulled everything out of my cabinets and threw it onto the floor, trying to see what was missing, where my things are. I’ve always been particular about people going through my things like my phone or my journals. But I felt like a new level of crazy.

I started yelling at them about where my books are, why they went through my things. It was a screaming match. They basically said that I’m never going to organize my room so they had to. And that it’s their house so I have no autonomy. They threw out what was garbage to them. And that I’m not allowed to keep my books that I paid for in my room because there’s no space. 

I started sobbing and shaking and screaming about my stuff. Not my greatest moment, and I don’t know where those emotions were coming from. 

My parents got so mad that they put everything in garbage bags are told me I need to move out. I’m still in school and my part time job does not pay enough for me to even afford rent. 

How can I talk to parents about why I reacted the way I did, and convince them to let me stay? 

tl;dr My parents cleaned up my disorganized room, I had a breakdown over it, and now they’re mad at me and want me to move out. I can’t afford to. How can I explain myself and convince them to let me stay?"
10,"Boyfriend (26) got uncharacteristically angry when I (25) jokingly asked him to marry me


We’ve been together about a year and a half. Last night when he came home from the store, he said “hey babe, I got you some sweet tea at the store” to which I replied (with the inflection of Maebe from Arrested Development) “marry me!” 


He immediately whipped around and said “why did you just say that to me” and I said “huh?” And he said “what the fuck am I supposed to say to that?” And I was kinda taken by surprise so I just said “um.. I don’t know. I’m sorry?” And then hit play on the tv. And then he screamed “no you’re fucking not sorry” and got belligerent asking over and over what I expected him to say. “I was just trying to be cute, I thought you’d just be sweet and say Ok baby!” 


And he said “so what then we’re just fucking engaged?!” And proceeded to yell for a solid five minutes about how I only said “marry me” to try to make him mad. To clarify, I’m not a confrontational person at all and was immediately trying to diffuse the situation by apologizing and trying to just move on. Also, I’ve never said anything to purposely anger him and I’ve never tried to pressure him into talking about marriage. 

I asked him to please stop yelling at me and he yelled “I’m not fucking yelling” to which I kind of scoffed at and he mocked me laughing, said “fuck you,” and went and got his shoes and keys and left. He came back maybe 40 minutes later and I was in bed and he came in and said “I’m sorry for yelling.” And I just asked if we could talk about it later. We still haven’t really talked about it because I don’t know what to even think. He has a quick temper but it’s usually just when he’s trying to do something and it won’t work. It’s never been directed at me like that. 

Like, this felt 100% insane and came out of nowhere. 
What do you guys think I should say?

Til;dr: jokingly told my boyfriend to marry me, he went off the rails and screamed at me for ten minutes for purposely making him angry and we still haven’t discussed it"
11,"Update: My [35F] husband [38M] is . . . obsessively buying groceries??


[Original](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/cvgygu/my_35f_husband_38m_is_obsessively_buying_groceries/)

I'll break this into two parts - one about trying to talk to him and the second about his health.

I tried discussion the excessive purchasing on two occasions, both immediately after him bringing home groceries and also separate from it. Both times he got angry, defensive, and yelled, a lot. So then I took a general tally of what we had that was excessive (for example I have 10 cans of different types of southwestern beans, 10 jars of preserves/jams, 2 loaves of the same flavor of specialty bread and 2 packages of English muffins of that flavor, 6 containers of watermelon and similar of berries, about 20 single serve yogurts, 20 packets of individual flavored tuna, and 4 containers of limeade, so much cheese the cheese drawer fell down, multiple boxes of flavored crackers, among many other duplicate things. This is mostly from the past couple weeks. He insisted these things would get used. I showed him how much food I was throwing out from the last week, and that there was seriously NO room left. This also got him upset and defensive. However, on days when given a small list of things, he does better (but still gets extras, or forgets some of the things I asked for)

Part two: after one of these trips, he ended up sitting on the floor having muscle spasms in his legs and stuttering severely, having trouble speaking, trouble standing, and was very agitated. This has happened before, the worst episode being that he fell in the middle of the night a couple months ago and kept having these spasms, but would not go to the hospital, or follow up after. On another occasion this week, he mentioned not knowing how he got home because he couldn't remember the drive. When he messages me during the day it is frequently unintelligible/mistyped (he has always typed perfectly before). He has also repeatedly forgotten that he already bought an item, and has insisted he hears people talking at night when there is nothing but silence. 

So, looking at part 2, I am going to focus my efforts on convincing him to go to a neurologist, and just - for now - donate all excess perishables and some of the canned goods to the local food bank and the 'little free pantry' stations around town. I'll work with my therapist on my own ability to cope. I honestly don't know how this is going to go, but I appreciate all the comments. 

Tl;dr: tried talking to husband about grocery hoarding, led to more conflict, he has many concerning symptoms so I'm going to move forward with pushing him to go to a doctor and just manage the hoarding symptom for now."
12,"My(24F) best friend(22F) found one of my nudes on her boyfriend(22M)’s phone


Well hi reddit, welcome to the clusterfuck.

TLDR at the bottom 

People Involved: 
Best Friend- N
Her boyfriend- G
Me- M


A bit of backstory before the juicy bits. N and I have been best friends for about 8 years now. We did everything together up until college. Played the same sport, had the same friend group, liked the same music, liked the same clothes, the list goes on. Even then, when separated by 600 miles, we stayed close. Facetime, texting, trips to surprise one another, sending gifts, even making time to spend our favorite holidays together. She moved to the state above me after college and I went back to home town. We visited each other literally every weekend. Road trips, camping, spontaneously taking weekend flights, you get the picture. Peas in a pod.  

As we got older and our view points on life changed over the years, our relationship had been constant and grew with us. Until she met her boyfriend. 

Admittedly, them dating is my fault. But, that’s a story for another time. Long story short, they’ve been dating for a year. No one in our friend group likes him. All of us have voiced our opinions on him, but we respect her choice to stay with him. She’s still invited out on the weekends, she’s still included in meet ups and brunch and all of the things. She turns them down though, because he doesn’t feel comfortable with us. Particularly.. me. 

They moved in together when N moved back to our hometown. He and I had a “fight” very early on in their relationship, over a picture that I had sent her. It was of her and a guy she previously had a thing with(years before she met him). I sent it with the caption “omg remember your hair” and a ridiculous amount of emojis. She responded with “I KNOW” and the laughing emoji. He goes through her phone (yes I know it’s not normal or healthy, I’ve explained it to her and not only does she not care, they both believe it’s a hallmark of trust *heavy sigh*), finds the picture, loses his fucking brain beans over it and this results in an argument. My response was “grow a pair and learn to deal with life because guess what both of you have past partners, dumbass”. Poetic, no? 

Now! The good stuff

My best friend asked me to dog sit for her bc she was leaving for a month. Sure! No problem, I have a dog that likes dogs and her dog likes dogs. Dogs. 

A month goes by and everything is smooth sailing. She calls me when I get off work and reaffirms plans of getting a drink, catching up and getting her dog. Hell yeah happy hour is my time to shine. I show up, she looks cute and tan where as I look like I’ve been talking to Karen’s all day(I had been). We chat for an hour and drink mojitos. The dog gets pats, life is good. And then I make the mistake of asking how G is. 

N: “He’s good. You won’t believe what I found on his phone though!”

Me: *internal sigh* “What?” 

N: “So I went through his phone two night ago and found this app that locks pictures. And like, it’s password protected but I know his shit, so I get in and it’s a normal photo album. But then, I see a one with a lock on it and I go to that one!” 

At the point she’s smiling like the cheshire cat. I feel bile building in the back of my throat talking about this cockroach of a human. 

Me: “Annnd?” 

N: “And he has 4 albums. Each of them is full of HUNDREDS of nudes. Two for his ex’s, one for me, and then another one that’s random! Like, what the fuck?!” 

Me: “Genuinely... what the actual fuck..” 

N: “That’s not even close, girl. He has one of you!” 

Me: “Impossible. Literally there is no way that’s feasible.” 

N: “No, those are definitely your tits.” 

She goes on to describe a picture that I had sent to her 3 YEARS AGO. Let that sink in folks. 3. Years. Ago. They have been dating for ONE year. 

Me: “How the fuck did he get that? What the actual fuck?” 

N: “He must have sent it to himself from my phone? I don’t know? But I confronted him about it and we’re good now.” 

She drops the subject. I don’t make a scene because we’re in public and I’m shell shocked. I’ve never sent this man a god damn text, picture, gif, smoke signal- any of it. She leaves, seemingly fine, and I go home to ruminate. 

So, reddit and drama lovers alike, please listen to my rambling for a little longer. He sent pictures of me to himself from his girlfriends phone. Pictures that only she and one other person have, the third party is wholly unknown by G- of that I am certain. She is seemingly okay with this fact. He has not, AT ALL, reached out to me to apologize or even defend himself. She didn’t elaborate for even a single moment on why this is stupendously and extremely fucked up to begin with. Fuck the rest of his pictures, I’m your best friend. And he lost his marbles when I sent you a picture about you hair?? HAIR?? 

I feel.. horrified. I don’t know what to do. I’ve been in multiple verbal altercations with him before. He is petty, vile, manipulative, selfish. and just all around terrible. I have no idea how to .. talk to her about this. I’m terrified that he sent it to someone, mutual friends, guys that I know etc. 

Reddit, what in the sweet fuck do I do? 

*TLDR* This wet fart of a human my best friend is dating sent himself pictures of me off of her phone.. the not appropriate kind. She finds them, mentions it to me and acts like it’s not a big deal. Send help"
13,"My [31M] GF [30F] has gained over 40 lbs in our first year of dating


I love my GF but am frustrated, sad, and losing physical attraction to someone I originally couldn't take my eyes off.  Since we started dating she's gotten more and more comfortable and put in less and less effort.  Meanwhile, my physical fitness has remained about the same despite her efforts to sabotage it (guilt me into skipping the gym to hang out with her, telling me I'm only going to the gym to make her feel bad, suggesting extremely unhealthy meals).  I've tried to encourage her to exercise, offered to cook us healthy meals, invited her to come to the gym, go on bike rides, walks in the park - nothing takes.  My exercise habits are not to guilt her, but because it helps me manage my anxiety disorder and health - a habit that long pre-dates her.  

Here's the rub: she only wants to do things she likes.  She flat out says she hates exercising, hates salad, and is an extremely picky eater.  She only likes carbs, meat, potatoes (who doesn't??) and hates vegetables.  She'll fully acknowledge she is a picky eater, but I get frustrated by her being unwilling to put in any effort or do something she may not like.  Obviously eating Taco Bell and skipping the gym is more enjoyable (and less effort) than going to the gym and eating a wholesome dinner.  To make things worse, her parents will come visit and bring her a freezer full of cookies and unhealthy snacks.  Her job is at one of those companies that stocks their kitchen with free snacks, takes their employees out to lavish meals with clients (1-2x/week plus lots of alcohol).

When we started dating she gave me the impression she regularly exercised.  It's an important part of my life and I've always dated people who feel the same.  But then she canceled her gym membership last month almost like throwing it in my face, because she made the call while we were together.  She never really went anyways, except to walk on the treadmill for 20 minutes or using the sauna.  

The weight gain has taken a toll on our sex life too - we still have sex a lot (1-3x each time we see each other), but I'm having a hard time enjoying it as much as I used to.  This may be TMI, but she no longer has any energy to be on top or switch positions, so sex is her just laying there.  She will constantly make statements like ""I'm a fat cow,"" ""omg I'm disgusting,"" ""Jesus look at my stomach"" and then laugh it off and do nothing about it.  I used to say ""no you're not"" to things like that but have stopped.  She talks about her weight gain every day but it's a joke to her. It's beginning to feel like she doesn't care about my physical attraction to her and it makes me feel bad.  Honestly, this problem might be fixed if she would just put in ANY effort.  I'd be so attracted to her making an effort and feeling good about herself!  I can deal with a few extra lbs. ya know, but not the laziness.   

No I haven't told her that I'm losing physical attraction to her even though that's the point I'm at.  I've tried the supportive, lead by example method, I have told her I want her to be happy with herself and feel good about herself.  If this is one year in, I'm very worried about what the future holds.

Any advice would be appreciated! I really love her so much, could see myself marrying her.  I do not want to hurt her feelings or say something insensitive about her body but I worry about her health and our relationship.

**Tl;dr**: GF gains weight, knows it/doesn't care, sabotages my efforts to remain healthy. 

For anyone wondering, she is 5'2"" and I can assure you she is no longer still in the healthy weight range."
14,"I [28F] can't get my husband [36M] of 2 years to stop micromanaging me


A few months after my husband Ben and I started seeing each other back in 2012, I was diagnosed bipolar type 1. I had a huge manic episode that scared the shit out of him. Since then he's read everything to be found about the disease and has done everything he can to help me manage it.


But he's also slowly begun to micromanage me. I think he believes that if he removes all of the negative stimuli, and introduces only positive stimuli, I won't have another manic episode. I think that's an admirable goal, but I wasn't aware of just how far he'd take it.


There's a long list of things I'm not allowed to do anymore. For instance, I used to read fantasy novels and listen to music, but now I am only allowed to read textbooks and history novels, and music is okay if I'm exercising but not otherwise. I used to be a part of fan-fiction writing groups - those were banned early on, and recently he lost his mind when he caught me sneaking on one of the websites. I used to play videogames. He took our console apart. TV is okay so long as it's with him, but he's moved the TV into a back room where there's no furniture to sit down, so you have to watch it standing or on uncomfortable camp chairs. I would occasionally indulge in a diet soda. He took my debit card. Oh and Reddit is mega-banned so yes I'm making this post in secret.


Basically, me being jobless, there's little reason for me to leave the bed, which I haven't done these last 6 days. He sees this as permissable behavior so long as I also don't eat. Yesterday I finally drug my ass out of bed and he suggested I get out into the community, find hobbies and volunteer opportunities and exercise more, but at this point I'm really just feeling lazy and numb and I just want to make my husband understand he doesn't have to do all this. But he gets so intensely emotional whenever I mention it.
Is this something that couple's counseling can help us with? I know I have my own problems and I should probably have my own therapist, but I've tried everything to explain my point of view to Ben, and it's not getting through - and things are getting steadily worse.

TL;DR: My husband keeps making rules for me to follow. Can counseling help?"
15,"My (23 M) girlfriend (30 F) won't stop buying crickets she doesn't need to prove a point


A few months ago my girlfriend caught some frogs at a local creek and bought a little habitat for them and some fruit flies and crickets to feed to them. After about two weeks she released them, because she felt guilty that they weren't living as good a life as they could outside.

But here's the thing, out of the three pet store employees she talked to when she first asked advice about caring for the frogs, one of them gave her a hard time about taking the frogs out of nature. Two of them told her that a lot of people take frogs from that creek as pets and told her ""good luck"". She seems to have some unreasonable feelings about being shamed by the one pet store employee.

Two weeks ago  I realized she was still buying crickets from the store with the ""rude"" employee. She's trying to prove her wrong about her pet frog experiment, and pretend she still owns the frogs and they're doing great. I guess she's just releasing all of the crickets in her backyard. The crickets are extremely small, so this isn't an infestation problem. We don't live together. My issue is that it seems really weird that she cares that much about what a stranger thinks of her. I asked her how long she plans on doing this, and she said maybe a couple more weeks and then she will stop if she can find a sly way to let that employee know that she only stopped buying them because she's ""getting them from another store"".

I told her this is weird and unnecessary and she got very defensive and told me I'm too judgemental of ""everything she does"". I feel like if I can't talk to her about this, how will I deal with it when something like this comes up that DOES affect me? Am I too concerned about it?

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR: my girlfriend is trying to prove a pet store employee wrong who thought she would be a bad frog owner, by buying crickets for two frogs she no longer has. She thinks i'm mean for telling her it's weird"
16,"My friend (23f) joined a culty empowerment group and is having sex with the married leader (42m) I'm grossed out and not sure if I (26f) should walk away



I know this might be all over the place but please bear with me, anyway my friend is pretty much in love with a guy who's married and twice her age and I think he's manipulating her and she's in his weird cult group 

He's been married for almost as long as she's been alive (21y) and has four children ranging from pre teen to 24, she knows the wife and is friends with her. 

So married man is a bit of a 'spiritual' person, although I think he just likes the idea of being spiritual more than actually being spiritual, he's one of those people who are always talking about energies and chakras and moon cycles and stuff, which is fine cause everyone has their own interests but the way he does it really irks me cause he acts as if he's better than everyone else, and tends to talk 'at' you, rather than to you. 

So married man decides to rent out a huge space from someone to turn it into a 'platform for empowering creativity' basically he has no clue what he wants to do with the place, just some convoluted idea to give musicians and creatives a platform, which means he just talks about how he wants to empower musicians and artists in very vague ways which are neither profitable, empowering or coherent 

My friend works for him and he pays her a dollar or so an hour, she puts in twelve hours daily Monday to Friday and usually weekends cause he guilt trips her into 'being with him' which means more work, work is basically him indoctrinating her with his commandments which are really contradictory and general bullshit you'd find on culty self help sites 

Anyway he has four people who always orbit around him, they are all my age and all share his spiritual persona and massive ego and they make me extremely uncomfortable because they treat you like some idiot and try to explain 'life' to you every chance they get, they also don't respect personal boundaries and think they could touch you whenever they please and get pissed if you call them out. 

I'm convinced this is a cult group. While I'm deeply worried for her, I'm not sure there's anything I can do to help. Any concerns I express about the group and her involvement with it are dismissed as me not being positive and trusting in him (she legit thinks he knows everything and is powerful/untouchable) 

Her company has become unbearable, as most of what she now has to say centres around how brilliant and amazing him and the group are, she thinks the stuff he says (which is cliche regurgitated garbage) is so profound 

I feel icky about the whole situation, part of me wants to help her (and I did talk to her about this in great lengths to no avail) 
And another part of me is really put off by how naive she's being and disgusted that she's so OK having sex with someone else's husband and still being friends with the wife 

I need a different perspective to this 

Tl;dr- friend joined some weird culty spiritual empowerment group where she's having sex with the leader, I'm not sure if she's worth saving"
17,"my (19f) dad (39m) is dating someone (20f) a few months older than me


just for a bit of backstory, i don’t think my dad has ever had any luck with dating. my mom and him broke up when i was five and ever since then he has had girlfriend after girlfriend. however, they have always been around his age or at least late 20s. he has been wanting me to meet his new girlfriend (of two months), and he decided to make today the day. i have learned to not take any part in my either of my parent’s personal lives (this sounds really shitty but let me explain). they will sometimes come to me to vent or get my input on their relationships and i generally don’t entertain any of it because i don’t want to be part of any of it. as long as they’re happy, then it’s fine. however, i have just had a rollercoaster of a night. 

today, we decided to go out to dinner and then to dave &amp; busters. she looked young right off the bat, and she had the mannerisms of a 20-something year old. throughout the dinner, she kept on touching my dad and doing some heavy PDA right in front of me (which made me insanely uncomfortable). i thought “hmm, maybe she just looks really young..” but at one point during the dinner she began to talk about the new Apple Card and how she tried to apply for one but they declined her application because she has no credit built up, which told me everything i need to know. my dad would take me out to meals and arcades and such with his girlfriends when i was younger, and it was fine when i was like 8 and or maybe like 12, but when i began to grow older it just started feeling like i was a third wheel. however, this time it genuinely felt like he took a friend and i on a play date. it was the most bizarre thing ever. i didn’t figure out that she was only mere months older than me until i later found her instagram and saw a post from a few months ago where she celebrated her 20th birthday. 

am i wrong for feeling super grossed out about his new relationship? i understand that it’s his life and his happiness is important, but this all makes me feel incredibly sick. it’s gross to me. and i know that i won’t be able to tell him anything about it or even hint at the fact that i think it’s absolutely insane that she’s literally my age because my he has the shortest fuse known to mankind and will literally lose his shit at the smallest mention of the fact that i have a problem with it. for now, im the most uncomfortable i have ever felt in my entire life. im uncomfortable even conversing and interacting with him.


TL;DR my dad just recently started dating somebody a few months older than me and im incredibly uncomfortable but i feel like im the one in the wrong for feeling weird about it"
18,"I (26f) found out my long term boyfriend (29m) is living a double life


I don't even know where to start. Last week, I woke up to a woman at my door that claimed to be my boyfriend of 3 year's wife. I thought she was a crazy person because I had literally woken up next to him that morning and he's the sweetest most loving person I know. She had plenty of proof however, he had two groups of friends, two social media accounts, two emails, two of everything. He left work and came to my place too and I pretty much just sat back in shock as the two of them had a screaming match. This is a person who had never raised his voice to me. She showed me pictures of a diary of his that described his uncontrollable anger and stories of hitting his son and tearing up his son's homework in frustration. I'm at a loss and probably still in shock a week later. He was the most loving boyfriend I've ever had and now I'm realizing I didn't know him at all. I have a list of therapists my insurance covers so I'll hopefully be able to make myself go to a few sessions. My entire future just fell apart in front of me. I keep waiting to wake up from this. I'm not sure why I'm posting this, I just needed to tell someone besides my parents.

Tl;Dr : my boyfriend of 3 years is a compulsive liar with a double life"
19,"I (17F) feel like I'm single handedly running the household and I'm beginning to go off the rails. I've come to resent everyone in my family and it's taking a toll on my mental and physical health. Really really need some advice before I fucking yeet myself over a cliff in frustration.


This is going to be a long one. First, some context. Both of my parents are doctors and I have a sister still in elementary school. I graduated high school a couple of months ago and I'm set to start college overseas in like 3 weeks. 

My family is super dysfunctional. My dad has generalised anxiety and depression and in addition to that, he has an undiagnosed mental illness wherein he fucking loses his mind and screams at the smallest things going wrong, slurs his speech, becomes super clumsy and absent minded and generally acts totally drunk even though he doesn't drink. This continues for long stretches of time, often more than a month at a time, with a brief period of relative normalcy in between that lasts about a week. His refusal to get treatment or even admit to this problem has caused my parents marriage to fall apart completely; they can't speak without screaming at each other; and my sister and I are dead scared of him to the point that we'll do anything he says and hide in our room when he gets home. He's developed some binge eating problem as well where he skips dinner and then eats trash all night and also now has this disturbing habit of munching ice cubes all the time. It's gotten to the point that he gets mad at us for using ice to make drinks, etc.

That being said, he cares about us a lot. He is covering all my expenses for college and handled all of the issues with obtaining my visa, etc and has given me the best education available in this country. He would die before letting any harm come to us or our futures. However, this has now become really suffocating for me. All college emails go to his email address. He doesn't trust me to check over the documents required myself or generally figure my shit out even though it's high time that I start doing so. He's obsessive about my future to the point that throughout this summer, he's called me at least 6 times throughout the day everyday to stress over the same issue and I've gotten so fucking tired of it that I'm not even looking forward to university. He's sucked the fun out of it to the point that the thought of it stresses me out. He's dangerously codependent on me; he calls up to rant about all his stresses and there are many, especially bc his anxiety makes him worry over literally everything. 

It's not just him. My sister depends on me for everything from emotional support that my parents don't give her, to company as none of her school friends live nearby, to the discipline, rules and structure that parents are supposed to give small children. She is attached to me to the point that she calls up several times when I'm out, or begs to go out with me and my friends. This strikes everyone outside my family as extremely weird- which it should- as what kind of 4th grader wants to hang out with 17/18 year olds? My mom encourages it; when I was 15 or 16 I wasn't allowed to go out unless I took my sister with me. Or I would be allowed but she'd guilt trip me to the point that I'd bring her along anyway.

My mother and I have a strange relationship. We bonded over our mutual difficulty dealing with my father and his constant beration of everything about us, from our weight to our lifestyles. His psychotic behaviour and refusal to fix it has led to my mother basically disengaging herself from family life; although they work on the same floor of the same hospital, they barely speak to each other. Any communication between them that doesn't involve family finances or work occurs through me. My mother has been having an affair for a really long time. I'm aware of it, and while I don't like it, I understand why she's doing it. She has gone through hardships no one should ever have to go through and without any support from our extended family when dealing with my father, it's no wonder that she's given up on the marriage and now looks for comfort and companionship elsewhere. My sister is aware of it too but I don't think she understands the nature of the relationship; she just knows that it's not something she should ever talk about. But my mom's disconnection from the household beyond cooking dinner for us and talking with us briefly about our lives means that the bulk of supporting my sister and father emotionally has fallen to me.

I only realised just how bad it was when I left my house for the first time in weeks since graduation to hang out with my friends at someone's house. Before i left, my dad called up and started to yell about how my mom wasn't picking up the phone and he had something important to discuss so how dare she not answer. I said ""Why are you shouting? I'll just go get her.""  About half an hour later, I left the house just as he came home for lunch and he asked me ""why were you yelling at me?"" I hadn't even raised my voice... 
My sister called me up several times during the day, each to ask me what time I was coming home. 

We were chilling at my friends house watching a horror movie with ice cream, and over the course of the 2 hour movie, I got literally 7 calls from my dad, 3 calls from my mother and 2 from my sister. I noticed that 4 of the calls I missed from my dad were within the first half an hour of me leaving. This was the day before the results of an extremely important exam were released and he was more stressed than I was. When I called him back he literally went on a 20 minute rant about it and I was almost on the point of tears bc all I wanted to do was forget about the results and the fact that my friends were waiting to play the movie again for 20 minutes was extremely embarrassing. Once I hung up I was furious. I called up my mom and yelled at her for telling him that I thought the grade boundaries were going to be high this year and told her that if either of them called me up again in the next few hours, I wouldn't come home. 

I felt like total shit. My friends and I went out for dinner but I was completely out of it the whole time. Although my phone didn't ring again, all I could think about was how angry I was, about how much I hated my life, how much I wanted to just enjoy being a teenager with my friends. I have turned down countless invitations from my friends to go partying this summer, and as I sat there, I realised how much I had missed out on. One of my friends lit a cigarette and passed it around, and everyone took a drag except me, and they did it like they'd done it a hundred times. One of my friends laughingly commented about how ""innocent"" i was, and though she absolutely meant no harm, it struck a chord in me. I'm extremely academically inclined and for the past few years have focussed on college as I saw it as my only way out of this life. But I had planned to spend this summer doing all the things I hadn't let myself do in school, to just enjoy being 17. I knew people perceived me as a stick in the mud but inside, I did want to let loose, I did want to just live in the moment. But when your family keeps calling you every few minutes, it's difficult to do so. I had secluded myself in my house for several weeks bc it didn't seem worth the effort and my experience on this day just proved me right. 

It wasn't just the cigarette. My friends now had inside jokes that I wasn't part of. My closest friend seemed surprised that I didn't know some of the stories she was referring to during conversation (we've always told each other everything, and this was a reflection of how distant I'd become from everyone). Most of my friends go to a different school, so I was used to not always knowing what they were reminiscing about, but this time it was different. This time, I felt more isolated than I have ever felt before. As I sat there with the evening light fading and my friends laughing over their pizza and their cokes, I wondered whether the reason I couldn't enjoy myself was really my family or just myself. Maybe I was a stick in the mud after all and my years of dealing with my family had led me to develop anxiety over the simplest things.

 It's been a few weeks since that day, and I've been going out more and gone to a party at a club and proven to myself that I can in fact enjoy myself. But the family pressure is getting worse and worse. Wherever I go, I'm in fear of my phone ringing. When I'm at home and watching a show or showering, I'm afraid my maid will ask me for instructions or the landlady next door will ask me to give my parents a message, or my sister will throw a tantrum over my parents not giving her what she wants. 

My snap at my mother that day did not reduce my anger; I'm continuously raging on the inside and I feel like I've been snapping at everyone in the last few weeks. And I'm especially angry with myself. After all, I've always lived in comfort; no financial issues, roof over my head, good homemade food, maid to take care of domestic work. So what if I'm a little too sheltered and a little too reclusive? So what if it's only since recently that I've been allowed to leave my house on my own? Such things are common in my culture; in fact, I would say my father is almost liberal compared to other men from our culture. Surely, the cost of carrying the burden of my parents failed marriage, their fucked up issues and caring for my sister like a parent more than a sibling is justified by the fact that at least I'm going to college. My course was decided by my father, much like everything else in my life, but again, unlike many fathers in my culture, he at least picked something I have a slight interest in. And I'm not going to be in debt.

I guess the point of this post is that I'm fucking exhausted. I don't know right from wrong, I don't know how to be independent, I can't differentiate codependency from a healthy relationship and I'm so, so tired of being told what to do and of the expectations on me all the time. I've lost a lot of weight over the past year through healthy eating and portion control and am no longer overweight as I used to be, but I've started eating trash again due to stress and I've stopped working out. I've started to sleep for 10 to 11 hours which is not at all normal for me; when I sort of had my shit together I'd sleep 7 hours max. I'm physically exhausted all the time, constantly stressed out or depressed and keep snapping at everyone over everything. I'm afraid I'm turning into my father. My mom keeps comparing me to him. It's my worst fear.
I just really really need some advice and motivation to try to take back control of my life.

TL;DR- my family is codependent on me and the stress has led me to lose control over my eating and sleeping patterns and I'm now stressed, anxious and depressed all the time. Cutting them off is not an option  and I'm leaving to study overseas, but I just need some advice on how to get my shit together.

Damn, it feels good to just vent this."
20,"I [29] am getting fed up with my husband's [30] immaturity


I (29) have been with my husband (30) for 4 years, married for 1. I honestly don't even know how to phrase the exact problem, because it's more like a continuous stream of little problems that all arise from my husband's immaturity. 

I think a lot of stems from his upbringing. I love his parents dearly but they didn't teach him or his siblings a lot of basic life skills (I had to teach him basic hygiene things, money management, cooking, etc) and he was literally spoon fed everything his whole life - his parents would literally cook him dinner every night up until we moved out. The thing is, he isn't spoiled at all, and is actually very hard working - he is just very naive and immature. I try to be patient with him but I am getting fed up with how much this affects our relationship and how much of an emotional toll this is for me.

I feel like the mother or manager in the relationship. I feel like I constantly have to either do things myself, or monitor him to ensure things get done. This includes:

1. keeping track of plans/appointments we have, things we need to do, buy, etc - I suggested he keep a calendar or list (we tried both physical and on his phone) but neither seem to work, he ends up just relying on me to remember everything. This includes plans with his family and his own appointments.

2. I manage our finances. I've voiced multiple times that I'd appreciate help with this (I'm not an expert by any means) but when we sit and talk about things and I show him what I have he just kinda looks to see what I think we should do then agrees with me. He seems to want to help but doesn't actually do anything unless I give him specific tasks. I gave him a few specific things to manage (paying certain bills) and even those, I need to remind him about to make sure they get done every month.

3. He is continuously negligent and forgetful. He touches everything in the kitchen when handling raw chicken, forgets to wash his hands, moves my wet clothes into a pile so that instead of drying they seem like mildew, etc. I correct him when he does those things, and he says he will stop, but things don't change.

Also, his immaturity has affected our sex life. In the early stages of our relationship whenever I would bring up anything sexual it's almost like he... didn't know how to handle it..? So he would respond with childish humor. And while I'm all on board with being silly and ridiculous, the way he went about it was just... the opposite of sexy (think of the level of humor of kids giggling at the word penis in school). This resulted in us not flirting at all, not really talking about sex besides when we discuss this issue, and our sex life declining. Nowadays we have sex maybe once a month at best. We have talked about it, and I told him I'd like him to take this as his ""project"" to fix and he said he will make more effort. And... nothing has improved. He has expressed he would also like for things to get better, but again, if I don't do anything about it, it just doesn't get fixed.

All our arguments about these things go the same way. I bring it up. He gets defensive. I try my best to explain to him that I am upset and why, and that I just need him to listen. He eventually listens and realizes that I have a point. He becomes really apologetic and says he will stop. He seems really genuine and I believe he really does want things to change. Things are better for a short length of time, then go back to how they were. Rinse and repeat. It's almost like these things honestly don't occur to him unless I actively tell him to do something or am actively mad about it. I'm tired of feeling like his mother. 

I don't think he does any of this on purpose, and has no ill intentions. This doesn't change the fact that all this stuff has me at my wits end. I just want to fix things and don't know if I need to take a new approach that I am not seeing. What do I do?

TL;DR: husband is continuously immature and irresponsible, and it is starting to make me resentful. I want to fix things. What do I do?"
21,"I (24m) am abroad with my gf (22f) and it’s going terrible.


Been on a trip to a foreign county with my gf. 6 days in out of a month.

She suffers from anxiety and is medicated. When she gets anxious, she yells at me and is overall incredibly mean, no matter how calm I remain. If I tell her something like she’s being mean or hurtful, she says that I’m doing the same (because I’m telling her that, it hurts her and is me being mean. I say this in a calm tone).

She also gets incredibly irritated by little things. For example, if I have allergies and sniffle, she gets mad at me. If I silently move my lis a certain way, she gets mad at me. It feels like she’s watching for every micro movement I make just for the sole purpose of getting mad at me.

Whenever I try to resolve issues and hug her (this is how she says she wants issues to be resolved), she just pulls away and yells at me. If I stop hugging her while I’m being yelled at, she yells at me for that.

Her therapist told her that it’s not her fault that she has these angry outbursts at people, so she expects me to comfort her when she’s yelling at me.

Yesterday was an all day issue. She was mad as soon as we got on the subway because I looked at the map and nodded in the direction we needed to walk. She started yelling at me telling me we’re not a team. I hugged her and she just snapped at me. I pulled back and she just got more mad. She just had this terrible attitude all day after that.

I was in the shower the day prior and she opened the door, starred at me, said in an angry tone “what?” I just said “nothing”, then she closed the door.

Today, we slept in and she got mad at me that we slept in.

This is apparently how every relationship she’s ever had has ended.

I knew she had these issues, and I had seen them a bit before, but I never realized just how extreme they were.

I don’t know what to do.

TLDR: trip with gf has gone down the drain."
22,"UPDATE: I(19F) just found out that my boyfriend (24M) has multiple restraining orders against him.

I've been getting a lot of messages asking for updates on this one so here we go.

FIRST OF ALL I just want to thank you all for your comments, the nice ones and the not so nice ones alike. I didn't think that would get as much attention as it did.

We broke up a few days ago. He started acting differently shortly after I created the post. I guess it was a good thing, it was the only way that I accepted the fact that everything I wanted to stay for I would never have again. So I sent him a text to just say it wasn't working out.

All he said was that he agreed. Didn't put up a fight, didn't lash out, was probably glad to see me go. I know this is definitely the best case scenario and I know that everyone is entitled to leave for whatever reason they want, but it still hurts a lot to know that he never cared about me or even wanted me.

Anyway, I'm really sad right now but I know it's for the best and I figured all of you would want to know.

TLDR; we broke up. that's it. the rest is just me being pathetic."
23,"Me 27F didnt want my parents at my child's birth, and kept a lot of details private. My family thinks I am awful.


I made a throwaway for this. I am currently, literally, in the hospital with my husband 32M getting ready to be induced later today. 

My parents and I have had a strained relationship my whole life. That being said, in my teens I struggled heavily with drug use (my husband is aware of my past) and lied a lot about it to my parents. I got the help I needed. 

But that being said, my parents have never really believed a word that has come out of my mouth since. And my relationship has always been strained with them. They have never stopped treating me like I am 13 years old. The second I turned 11 (before I even got into drugs) they shoved me into therapy and insisted I had all these problems even when I didnt. Each time the therapist would say they thought I was a good kid they would cart me off to the next. So needless to say, not good.

Anyways, my husband is supportive of my lack of relationship with my parents. I didn't tell them I was pregnant until recently and now my mom doesnt believe me ??? We live out of state and the city we live in only has 2 hospitals. She insisted she come with my dad and I said no, please respect our privacy. My husband's parents arent even coming to the hospital. At least for the first few days. Even if my relationship was perfect with them, I would still want that privacy.

I ended up going to the hospital under a different name, because I wanted privacy. She is calling the hospitals and now saying she doesnt even believe i am pregnant because they say i am not there. It is all ridiculous and stressing me out, and I truly dont even know how to handle it.

Am I in the wrong here? What do I even say to her? My husband has been sending his family members (and a couple others of mine) periodic updates on the status of me and the baby. I gave my mom his number and said please feel free to text him for updates I am planning on staying off of my phone. She has refused to text him so far.

Her sister texted him and said ""WHAT HOSPITAL AND ROOM NUMBER THE FLORIST NEEDS IT?!?! ARE OP'S PARENTS THERE YET?!"" and my husband politely said we would like our privacy, *please* she lives about 45 min away and she said ""I dont have my kids this weekend, I'm going to come up to see the baby"" and my husband politely asked if she wait until we see how birth goes and how settled we get. 

I am not trying to take away an experience from my family at being at the birth of my child, but sheesh I want this to be shared between the 2 of us. I dont even know what to do. 

Tldr: giving birth, my family is refusing to respect my privacy and acting like lunatics. Am I in the wrong? How do I tactfully handle this?"
24,"I (26M) am going on a date with a coworker (20F) and am wondering if/when I should tell her about a horrible rumor about me


So a few months ago, not long after I started at my job, a rumor surfaced that I followed a coworker to her car after work. I don't know where it came from or how it started, but I immediately went to a manager and let him know as soon as I heard. He investigated, and the girl must've denied it, otherwise there would've obviously been consequences or something by now. But that hasn't stopped the rumor from persisting. At first all my coworkers were anxious or hostile towards me, but as they got to know me better, I think they realized I'm not that type of person. But I mostly work day shift, and while they're all mostly cool with me now, night shift definitely is not (just because the rumor is basically all they ""know"" about me. I've heard them whisper ""psycho"" and ""creep"" and things like that whenever I've had to work nights).

 Well a new girl started on night shift a few weeks after the rumor started, but she keeps to herself so I don't think she's heard the rumor. We only met a couple weeks back, and there was some instant chemistry, and I really like her. But I am TERRIFIED she's going to hear the rumor and take it as fact. We have our first date in a few days, and I'm wondering if or when I should bring it up. Like it gives me a ton of anxiety that's she's working around a bunch of people who hate me. I'm scared as soon as she asks one of them ""What do you think of Remag117?"" the rumor is going to come out and she'll think I'm some creep and it'll all be over, and that would honestly break my heart. I really like her guys

TL;DR I'm wondering if/when/how I should bring up a terrible rumor about me to a coworker I'm going on a date with"
25,"I [20f] had a one night stand over the weekend. He [28-29m] treated me more kindly than anyone else in my life right now and I desperately want to see him again. Is there a ""right"" way to ask him if he will see me?


I'm probably going to seem pretty pathetic in this post. Fair warning. I feel it most of the time, anyway.

I've had a bad couple of years. My parents and I had a falling out and they have wanted almost nothing to do with me since I was 18.

Not long after that I was in a year long relationship with a terrible person.

I did not think very highly of myself and he took full advantage of that. Towards the end he hit me more than once, and would guilt me or just force me into sex with him.

I finally managed to leave him about three months ago when he put his hand on my throat during an argument and I realized how scared of him I really was.

Since then I've not been interested in pursuing relationships. Ive had alot of flings with people of varying character. Some of them treated me okay, some not so much.

On Saturday I ran into a guy from my community college. He is handsome and friendly. I'm not 100% on how old he is, but he mentioned being ""almost 30"", so 28-29 seems like a good guess. He wound up inviting me to his bed, and I was happy to take him up on it.

I wont make you read through the NSFW details, but none of the guys I have been with have been so kind to me in bed. I am confident in saying the act felt better that night than it ever has before for me.

As we were finishing up I started crying. I dont know why I did, I wasnt upset or anything. I just felt really, really good and the tears started flowing. I think I freaked him out a bit because he asked me if I was alright and he gave me a massage until I stopped. He got up and brought me coffee and kept asking if I felt okay and was comfortable.

When we fell asleep not long after he wrapped me in his arms and the world felt completely perfect for me for the first time in a long time.

The next.morning he bought me breakfast at a place across the street and took me home.

It is going to sound completely dumb I know but I honestly feel like I fell in love that night. I really wanted to ask him if I could see him again before he dropped me off but I just could not work up the courage.

Now I am kicking myself for that. I'm pretty much thinking of him all the time now and my heart is aching to see him again. If someone asked me what I wamt most in the world right now, its to spend another night in those arms.

How do I approach him again? I know where he lives obviously, but going to his apartmemt unannounced doesnt seem polite and I dont want him to think I'm crazy.

Our campus isnt big so I think I could find him if I really look. Is approaching him on campus okay or too stalker? Should I bring, I do, coffee or flowers or slmething when I approach or is that too much?

I dont want him to think Im some crazy stalker I just want to find him and ask if he'll see me again.

Is there a right way to do this? I'm terribly bad at dating I think. 

Does anybody recommend a way to word my question to him so I dont sound dumb? And is approaching on campus appropriate? Please send help?

**TL;DR**: Fell in love with a guy I had a one night stand with. What is the most appropriate way to approach him to ask if he'll see me again?"
26,"I (27F) asked my bf (27M) to keep my pursuit of applying to law school private between us and he told his family and friends regardless. Is this as big of a red flag as I think it is?


So long story short I’m applying to law school and I’m studying for the LSAT hardcore. I’m only applying to the top three programs and fully aware that there is a very large chance I won’t get in. My bf and I have been together for like two months and I specially asked him not to tell anyone including his friends and family anything about me taking this test or applying to schools. Like I made it very clear. 

He told his parents and friends right in front of me and told them one of the schools I was looking at recently (2 weeks after I asked him not to). It’s really bothering me, I feel like he broke my trust. I’m also concerned because it makes me feel like his parents will be overly involved in our relationship going forward if he’s going to involve them in all of our private matters. 

When I told him it bothered me he just said that he wasn’t used to lying and he was proud of me for applying. It isn’t really a lie bc he went out of the way to tell them. Do you agree that this is a red flag?

TLDR; I’m applying to law school and asked my bf explicitly not to tell anyone bc I’d be embarrassed if I didn’t get in. He told people anyway and it’s raising red flags in my mind. What do you think?"
27,"My [16F] friends [15-17 M&amp;F] constantly mock me or get irritated when I show up at the time we agreed. They call me a ""robot"" for not understanding. Am I the problem?


Example:

Random friend over text: Hey, OP. Let's hang out at 6 in my home. Everyone's coming.

*I show up at 6:10*

Friend: uuuuuhh, why are you here so early????!! I'm not even ready...

This case and other similar cases have happened several time over the years since high school started and they often get irritated that I'm at their place earlier than they expected even though I got pretty much exactly at the time they told everyone to be there.

Months ago I got to my friend's place (the usual hangout spot for our group) at 6:45 because she had texted me something along the lines of ""Hey let's watch the Magic vs Rockets game at 7, I told everyone"", soooo obsviously I have to get there close to 7 to not miss the game, and she still laughed and joked about how I'm always the first one to get there and she didn't expect people to get there early, since we usually watch games and they play ball outside, and they mostly come for the pickup later.

So it's like ??????!!!!

I get there in time because 1) they told me to get there at that time 2) because I live kind of far away from most of them and have to take a bus or two that take a while 3) because I gotta get back at 10:30 tops and it's kind of ridiculous to get there at 8:30 only to leave so quickly

If I explain this stuff they say I'm a nerd and say I'm weird and call me an aspy robot. It's not *that* common of a joke but it happens sometimes pretty much only to me because most of the other friends get there later or just ghost everyone and don't show up.

So, wtf? What is the deal with telling people to get there at 7 expecting them to come at 8:30 or whatever? Is this a common thing or are my friends just special that way? Should I just get there later? Seems kind of dumb to travel for 30+ minutes each trip to stay there for two hours when we are suppose to hang out.

anybody has any answers for me?

**tl;dr:** Friends tell everyone to show at X time, and when I do they call me nerdy and robotic for not getting that they actually expected us to get there 1+ hours later even when we are supposed to be there to watch a game. What should I do?"
28,"Father in law is too intimate


TL;DR: My FiL is a little  too friendly  in his affection and it creeps me  out, though I'm  certain it isn't  meant in a creepy way, looking for a gentle, curteous way to ask him to knock it off.

&amp;#x200B;

I(34F)  have an issue with my FiL. He is a very charismatic man. He walks into a room and he's everyone's friend. He raised an amazing son with whom I'm madly in  love with for more reason than I can write down. He is an extreme form of extrovert, people person, and such a family man,  he let his adult daughter, his adult  son, his  son's wife and their baby and cats all live in his house together for a year. My problem is, he  is  very intimate  in his way of showing  affection. It really freaks  me out and I don't know how to say something. I come from a background of abuse and no family and this family  is so far from any of what I was  used to, like  they raised my bar so high I don't  know how I ever got along with less. So I really love everyone, including him,  like  the family I didn't have. So  I just don't know how to approach this gently, I didn't have a family other than an abusive mother and my feelings were  never considered.

&amp;#x200B;

Like, sometimes when I go over there, I help cook dinner and I help with dishes. He'll come up behind me, give me a hug around the waist and  kiss me  on the neck, and he does the neck kiss when facing me  too. Just once he hugged me then *bent the fuck over* because  he's taller than me and patted me on the butt. In front of his wife who wasn't actually looking but still. I've seen him do  the neck kiss thing with his  daughter, his sister and his mother. I just think that's his  way. I've been willing to put up with the neck kiss even though it makes my skin crawl and I have a total mental lapse  when it happens. I want to snap  but I bite my tongue because I don't want to cause any ripples. I don't think he's trying to start anything but my instincts go bananas. But the butt pat thing, that got me a little more than the other. I was  like, are you for real right now, bending your ass down to my level? My man is the only one in this family of giants who should be bending over for butt touching. 

&amp;#x200B;

Now, I told my husband about it.  I told him it doesn't sit well with me, everything I wrote here and more. He told me to pull  his father aside one day when he does it and  just tell him how I feel. He thinks it would be a lot more inappropriate for  him to say something since  he's never there and there's no polite way to just bring up ""stop touching my wife."" He agrees his dad shouldn't be doing that and is willing to back  me up, but he thinks I should be the one to say something. I don't know how to say it nicely. I don't know  how to say it in a manner that is not accusing of anything. He does  it so fast, a hug, a peck, gone. Hug, pat, gone. He's a very animated person, cannot sit still for long. Usually there's a house full of people when he does it, so it's not invisible, it's not creepy no-one-is-around, he's-trying-to-hide-this status. That's why I hesitate because I don't want to blurt anything out in  front of everyone, but he's gone so dang fast and I'm dodging people, tripping over dogs and kids trying  to chase after him. So maybe if there's a way I can bring it up when we are just sitting alone, not like ""Hey, so, um, can you stop kissing my neck, it makes me feel really  creeped out? And don't touch my butt either."" 

&amp;#x200B;

I want a nice way to bring it up and/or a gentle way to confront him, if anyone has any ideas? I know he will care, he has cared about me and my feelings way more than my own mother ever did, I'm just scared to death of making him feel accused of something or somehow causing an issue in the family  dynamic. I appreciate any suggestions."
29,"My (f30s) FIL (70s m) not invited by family to a party because of his food obsession and MIL doesn’t understand


My FIL thinks of himself as a great gourmand. He talks about little else and every holiday, get together, book, tv show, is about food. Even when he thinks he’s being nice, it turns people off, like “Have this glass of wine/ Is it good? / That’s a $600 bottle of wine!” He was so angry the wedding I planned and paid for was cheap, he didn’t talk to me or my husband for months because it embarrassed him. I’ve never served him a meal because there’s no way it would measure up. 

Recently, I was invited to a family event and didn’t realize my in-laws weren’t invited and let it slip. My MIL’s head spun around and she asked me a million questions and was obviously hurt. The host of the party, his niece, said, “We didn’t need to hear FIL complain about the box wine and premade burgers and ruin it for everyone.” 
If MIL brings it up again, do I say something like, “FIL wouldn’t have liked it, it was just boxed wine and premade hamburgers.”? Or even “they didn’t think FIL would like it” ? Does she deserve the explanation? Or should I continue to try not to get involved and just duck the questions with vagueness?
I like these other in-laws (and it’s really nice for my kids to have cousins) and hope his obsession doesn’t mean they leave out his whole side of the family (including me), and I also don’t want to be the meddler who doesn’t get invited because she stirs drama. Should I ask for a head’s up if they aren’t invited next time? 

TLDR: his family left him out because he’d complain about the box wine, but I am happy to be included. What’s the best way to walk this tightrope?"
30,"I (f/25) can’t deal with autistic boyfriend (m/30) any longer and I feel terrible about it


Hi everyone. 
I’m probably going to sound like an asshole in this post but it’s not my intention, nor do I mean to offend/upset anyone. 

Me and my boyfriend have been together 3 years. He’s a good guy. He’s caring and his heart is in the right place. He has autism which is moderate I’d guess. He can care for himself fine but he’s very child-like and doesn’t understand “social norms” or boundaries. I knew he had autism before I dated him and that was fine. But 3 years in and I’m starting to get frustrated and honestly, depressed. 
He gets tics often (stims ?) where he’ll clap his hands and make a sound and this is really distracting when I’m trying to study so I’ll go into a different room and explain to him why. He has issues understanding things like this and will get upset and this is where the boundaries issue comes into it, because I just can’t seem to get any time away from him. He constantly wants to be right beside me. I can’t use the bathroom without him standing outside the door. He wants to hold my hand or have his arm around me pretty much 24-7. And I love his affection. But there’s times and days where I need some space and he doesn’t understand “please give me some space”. Same with sex. He doesn’t understand days that I don’t want to have sex and he’ll push for it and push and push and grope me when I’ve told him “no” because he just doesn’t understand personal space and boundaries. 
I fell down the stairs last month and broke my wrist and he saw it happen and spent so long in a fit of hysterically laughing and clapping his hands while I was clearly in pain and not ok and didn’t ask me if I was alright or help me up. 
He also very rarely asks if I’m ok and how my day was. And I know all that isn’t his fault. He’s not trying to be rude, he’s just lacking any social skills and norms. 
But I’m tired. I’m tired of feeling claustrophobic from the lack of space and on the other hand, feeling like I’m not cared about because he never asks how I am or takes any concern in me or my life. I’ve spoke to him about it but it’s hard to get him to understand. Things might improve for a while and then it’s back to the same again. I feel like such a terrible person for wanting to break up with this guy and I truly do care for him. But I’m literally going insane. I feel like I’m heading for a breakdown some days. 
What can I do, guys? Should I leave? 

TL:DR   Autistic boyfriend can’t help his behaviour but it’s pushing me to breaking point and I can’t cope anymore, but feel so guilty for wanting to leave and don’t know if I should?"
31,"My fiancé gets mad at me whenever I bring up cooking or groceries and I don’t know why



I (31F) love to cook for me and my fiancé (32M). I have loved to cook for much of my adult life, and I’m pretty good at it. My fiancé demonstrably enjoys my cooking because he eats all of it and eats the leftovers. I do all the cooking for us and I enjoy it so I don’t complain or ask him to help. He has told me, when I asked, that he would prefer that I do cook to me not cooking, and that he feels it adds value to his life. 

But! Cooking food has steps that go into it. Meal planning, grocery shopping, prepping, and dishes. And he has to participate in some of that stuff because I want to make food he enjoys and because I don’t make as much money as him. 

So I run recipes and recipe changes by him sometimes, I ask him if he has adds to the grocery list, he and I place the online grocery order together, and once a month or so I ask him to do a load of dishes while I get dinner started in order to prevent a delay in dinner being ready. 

And all of that sets him off. He gets angry, uncomfortable, mean, and/or ignores me while I’m talking directly to him. We generally have a good relationship. This is unusual. But it’s a pattern: I talk about the logistics of feeding us, and he gets mad and mean. 

I asked him why this pattern occurs and he simply said he doesn’t know. He said it’s not that he resents that I’ve effectively taken the lead in a part of our lives, which I suspected. He said it’s not that I am partially telling him how to spend his money by making a grocery list for us, which I also suspected. He said it’s not even that he wishes I could do it all with 0 input from him (which I would be willing to do, but I would prefer to be able to make sure he’ll like something before I cook it for the first time or change the way I cook it, which is why I ask). 

Does anyone know what might be going on? I don’t need his praise or appreciation. But I do need him not to be mean and ignore me just because I’m talking about chuck roast. 

TL;DR— I cook for me and my fiancé and I love doing it. But whenever I ask him about recipes he’d enjoy, ask him to place a grocery order with me, or otherwise mention the logistics of feeding us, he gets mad and a little mean. He doesn’t know why he does it. Any ideas?"

Im in my sophomore year of high school. I live with my parents and they both smoke heavily. I always smell like smoke.

33,"My boyfriend (31m) was totally uncompassionate when my (24f) project at work was destroyed in a freak accident.



I'm an engineer at a company that does industrial automation. We do custom solutions for very specific applications, most of our projects are one-offs or have a very limited number produced.

I really like my job, it's interesting work, and it's cool being able to work on a variety of projects. I'm working on embedded systems, and my job is a cool combination of writing software and working with devices hands on.

For the last year, I'd been working on a project, a custom autonomous vehicle for a very specific mining application. It was a really cool project, and I had a big role in it. 

We just shipped it off for onsite testing, and were going to send several of our team to support that. Then there was a disaster that destroyed a large amount of the mine, along with the vehicle. Luckily nobody was hurt.

But it still really sucked to see something I worked on for a year get destroyed by a freak accident. I was looking forward to seeing how my software performed in the field; getting real feedback on it. Plus it s just cool to see something you've made come ""alive"".

And it's dead for real; it was a one off project, and we know it's not going to be financially possible to rebuild.

My coworkers felt the same way, we were joking that it felt like we just sent our kid to college, and he got hit by a bus on the first day. It was only half a joke really; everyone was feeling really blue about things. 

Anyway, after work that day, I went home and told my boyfriend that the vehicle had been destroyed in an accident. He kinda shrugged and told me to hurry up and get ready for a concert we were going to.

I was a little annoyed he brushed it off, and also not really in the mood to go out and stand and dance at a concert all night. So I said I wasn't sure I wanted to go; If had a really bad day. 

And he said ""it's just work"" and brushed it all off, telling me to come out and have fun and forget about it. I was annoyed, at him for saying something important to me was ""just work"" and not important. Then we started to argue, he thought it wasn't something I should care that much about, I still have a job, it's not my money that was wasted, etc.

I told him that it was important to me; I had put a lot of thought and effort into something; it was disappointing to have nothing come of it. And he was upset my job seemed more important to me than my relationship; I had plans with him and I wanted to stay home and mope because of work. Even though he had been looking forward to the concert for a while.

I said I really wasn't ready to go after he'd been so rude. He could go alone but I wanted some time to take a breather after we argued. He went out alone, and that night I ended up going out drinking with some of my coworkers. It was a nice night, we had some time to vent, then get drunk and get our minds off of it.

I got home and my boyfriend was fed up to hear I'd gone out with my work group. And I was upset he still didn't get why I might want to have a chance to vent to people who ""get it""

How do we work past this? I just want some compassion tbh

tldr - A project I've worked on for a year at my job was destroyed in a freak accident. I was upset and doubly upset my boyfriend thought it was nothing worth caring about"
34,"My (28M) GF (24F) keeps telling me I need to go to therapy for a traumatic event, and I don't want to, but she has been constantly telling me I have to go for the past month, resulting in a lot of arguments. How do we resolve this issue?


Around 30-40 days ago I was in my neighborhood walking down my block, there were some guys on a stoop nearby hanging out. A car drove by, and they opened fire on them, and some of the guys on the stoop opened fire back. The whole ordeal went on for like 30 whole seconds, it was easily like 40\~ shots overall. I was maybe 50-60 yards away from it all, hiding behind a car. From what I understand, they hit the driver, so the car stalled, and the guys in the car got out and ran, hence why it went on for so long. But 3 of the people on the stoop were hit. After like 20 seconds after the shooting was over I looked and saw one of the guys on the stoop alone, and his friends running away. I went over and he was hit in the arm and a graze on his shoulder, and of course I called the police right away and I took my shirt off and tried to use it to cover his wound as much as possible. He was fine, but one of the people who ran away was hit multiple times and died somewhere down the block. 

&amp;#x200B;

ANYWAYS, that's basically what happened overall. My girlfriend was in our apartment and heard the whole ordeal on the streets. She came out maybe 40 minutes later and she saw me and absolutely freaked out because I had blood on me, but of course I was fine. 

&amp;#x200B;

Since then, she has been saying I need to go to therapy for trauma in relation to the incident. I was okay with this at first, of course she would be concerned, but I told her I was fine and that I only wanted to go if I was having problems related to it. I've seen shootings before, I've grown up in this neighborhood my whole life, this isn't entirely new (although being that close was). I mean my family used to have drills for when a shooting was going on out on the block, its not entirely new to me. 

&amp;#x200B;

But she has absolutely HOUNDED me about it for the past month now, saying that I just don't want to go because I am a man and I don't want to seek mental health treatment because it makes me look weak. That's absurd, considering she knows that I went to therapy after my brother died. I have no problems with that. She keeps saying she doesn't want to make it seem like I 'have to go' but that I really, really should and that she doesn't feel okay knowing that I could be traumatized and not getting help. We've had this argument like 10 times in the past month. Like I am sorry, I am not paying for therapy that I don't need. It also just feels weird that she is saying this as if I have no say in my own mental health. 

&amp;#x200B;

TL:DR - - I experienced a shooting, and my girlfriend is telling me I have to go to therapy and I don't want to."
35,"My Chinese Parents [52F,55M] want to retire early and want my [25F] sister [24F] and I to take over all the bills


 

My  mom's health has been worsening and she said that she is unable to work  and my dad works a manual labor job. Both of them make a combined  income of $120,000 per year. My dad has always been a bit secretive  about household finances so I am not sure how much money they have saved  for retirement. I only know that we owe around $400,000 mortgage on the  house that is worth around $1.3 million. A few days ago, my mom said  very aggressively that she doesn't care if we both live at the house or  not, but both of us MUST pay for the mortgage and all the bills because  they can't work anymore. Both of them said that we can keep the house  after they pass away. I did a rough mental calculation and it works out  to be about $2500-$3000 per month. I currently contribute about $500 per  month to live at home (groceries, bills, eating out). This amount  differs every month and my mom complains that it's not enough and that  there is no ""set amount"" being paid per month so it bothers her. This  month alone, I spent $200 on groceries, $75 on eating out and $250 on her shopping. I currently earn about $60,000 pre-tax per year and pay  $1500 per month on fixed debt (student loans, car payments, insurance,  gas, cell phone bill, food). If i contribute $1250 per month, I would be  left with about $300 per month for my own savings and emergencies.  Being left with so little at the end of the month makes me a bit nervous  especially since my job is not secure.

Here  is another problem, I don't want to live at home with the two of them  and I can't afford to move out if I start contributing. My sister is  also getting married soon and plans to have kids. If my sister and her  husband move into the house then how would the room arrangements be set  up? Do my parents still use the master bedroom and my sister and her  husband keep her childhood room? Where would their kid sleep? What do I  do if I plan to get married to my boyfriend?

My  mom has been very aggressive about this so NOT paying is NOT an option as it will create irreparable damage to our relationship.  Do I just give in and put myself into a hellhole situation? I really am at a loss.

TLDR; Chinese parents want my sister and I to take over all household bills so they can retire early due to poor health"
36,"How do I get my (26F) boyfriend (27M) to realize this isn't a big deal? (Accidental nip slip)


I just got a new tattoo on my sternum. My friend is about to get a new tattoo as we speak, and she sent me a picture of her stencil. I remember I told her I'd send her pictures of my tattoo, so I went into the bathroom and snapped a quick picture on my little flip phone. It goes up in between my chest, so I had to pull my shirt up so she could see the whole thing. I didn't realize my nipple got in the picture, waaaay up in the corner. My phone screen is small and the picture quality isn't great, so I just didn't notice. I sent it to her.

I then sent it to my boyfriend, because I thought he'd like to see it. He started joking about how he loves my boobs and thanks for including that in the picture (winky face) etc. I said oh shit, I didn't realize my nipple was in there. And he said, ""Seriously?"" and he asked if I had sent it to anyone else. I explained that I had sent it to my female friend. He said got angry and told me he told me to be careful about this kind of thing (I never send pictures, and I was really careful when getting the tattoo to stay covered, and even used a female artist) and anyway he's pissed. He told me I'm lucky it wasn't a dude or he would be really, really angry.

I've texted her about it and she has deleted the photo.

It was an honest mistake, but he has texted me like ten times and is mad and says I don't respect him.  How do I get him to realize this isn't a big deal? If he sent a photo of his dick to his male friend on purpose I wouldn't care at all. And this was an accident. 

TL;DR I accidentally sent a photo with my nipple in it to a female friend. Now he's pissed. What do I do?"
37,"My (27F) fiancé may be the dad of someone else’s baby... Have I done something wrong?


This is my first time posting... I’m feeling lost and would like some honest advice.

I’ll try keep this short as possible.

My fiancé told me two weeks ago that a girl (21) had messaged him saying he was the father of her child and she was 16 weeks pregnant. He told me it can’t possibly be his as nothing like that had happened between them.



I was obviously upset and knew of the girl (she liked all of his pictures on social media). 



He went on a night out 15 weeks prior to this on an overnight football trip. He had told me the next day that she was there but they hadn’t spoken all night.
After the baby revelation I asked how on Earth he could be the dad if they hadn’t even spoken. Turns out, in his words, she’d been all over him all night, following him around but he pushed her away. 
Then, she got into a taxi with him back to the hotel, where she walked him to his room and then left. ‘Nothing happened’ apparently. His dad who he was sharing the room with said that he didn’t hear or see anything.




So I’ve felt very betrayed and confused; not only because of the whole baby scenario but he’s also lied to me. 



I pulled out of the house we were buying. He was very angry I had done that and said I’ve made a decision without even consulting him. (I was putting the majority of he deposit down myself). 



His behaviour toward the situation was raising a few red flags. He’s deleted her messages about it. He rang her without me knowing. Didn’t seem angry that someone is apparently making this up and causing friction between us.



Fast forward to now... he ended it with me yesterday. I asked for two things from him. One to perhaps try relationship counselling (a point blank no from him) and if he could ring the girl in front of me and ask why she’d made this up. 



He hasn’t done either of and then started acting annoyed at me for acting ‘cold’ and ‘disinterested’ towards him. 



I suffer with anxiety and don’t always respond to situations well as I over think everything. However, I’d like to think I handled all this quite maturely. I didn’t shout at him, call him names... nothing like this. I simply asked for space to think and then met up a few times to speak about it all and ask questions. Then suggested counselling to over come the issues. 



Have I done anything wrong? I don’t understand why he’s ended it with me? I feel like a stupid idiot because I was willing to work through this and see if we could stay together. I love him and I was obviously committed to being with him forever. Is this just an admission of guilt ? 



Sorry it’s so long. I just have no idea what to think.



TD;LR. Everything was fine, a girl has messaged saying he’s he dad to her baby. He’s denied it and now ended it because he doesn’t want relationship counselling and I’m ‘ messing with this head’."
38,"I [24f] am pregnant. My boyfriend [24m] is telling his parents at a dinner that I'm not invited to.


I'm 12 weeks pregnant and told my dad about 3 weeks ago as he is my only parent and best consultant. I discussed my options with him and he was very supportive. My boyfriend has been eager to tell his family as his grandparents really want to see us have babies.
When he found out he would only accept that we have the baby and any other choice is out of question.
To be honest I considered terminating the pregnancy until I found out how far along I was / seeing the ultrasound and the baby move.

Lastnight he told me he made plans to have dinner with his mom and dad and that was it. I asked him today why he is telling them our news without me since he mentioned today hes going to be late for dinner.
I find it inconsiderate on his end and I know that they'd want me there.
He replied ""do you really want to be there? I was going to discuss others things aswell""
I replied that I dont want to be there I will be missing from there. He said fine I wont tell them, hes still going out for dinner and I'm still not invited.

I want to tell them in the second trimester incase of a miscarriage. 
I'm really hormonal and this is making me feel so weird.
Any advice on how to feel about this would be appreciated.. 

Tldr; feeling left out of my boyfriends plans to tell his family that were having a child in 6 months."
39,"Wife (29) expects me(M31) to be ok with attending inlaws insane Vegas party


This is hard call for me. I could well be way out of line.

TLDR, Wife's family organised a Vegas blowout for he brothers 27th birthday. We are expected to attend and pay a third when there are five grown, fully employed family members (plus partners) who will almost certainly attend. The place we are paying for coincidently has five bedrooms.

Last year I turned 30. My wife organised a party at a local bar. It was a blast and about half my wife's immediate family turned up. I didn't expect or need any of them to come, but they did. I appreciated the effort, but honestly it's not like it cost them anything. They got free food and drink, no hotel needed and only one even brought a card. 

So when my wife asked if I'd be ok going to her younger brothers' 28th birthday, I said yes. Of course I'd go.

Yesterday, I got the details of what I'd agreed to. My wife's parents decided to turn the birthday into a big family vacation. They've booked a huge Penthouse Villa just off the strip. All we've been told is the price and shown a photo of the room picked for us.

We now owe them over $1000 for pretty much the smallest room in the penthouse for three nights. I told my wife that I thought the room seemed overpriced and she got pretty defensive. At that point, I knew something was up. s I felt I had to ask questions because I can see what's coming.

I asked these two questions, what was the total cost of the penthouse villa and how many rooms total. This might sound odd to you, but trust me, I've seen variations of this before. My wife said she didn't know how many rooms but the total cost was $3300. At this point, I'm thinking, well that means a three bedroom penthouse.

I tell my wife that I wish we'd been involved in picking the place as we could have got one way cheaper. Now we've got to pay over $1000 for an OTT place to stay , airfare, get my parents to babysit the kids. All for a 27th birthday for a guy who came to my 30th, had some free beer and left after an hour. Don't get me wrong, he's a decent enough guy. It's the room thing that gets me mad.

I find the penthouse on AirBnb. It's not a three bedroom place. It's a five bedroom place.   


So why are we paying a third I ask my wife? She replies it was the only one her parents could find. I mean seriously, in Vegas. Also, the price I'm looking at on AirBnB is close to half what her parents are asking. Apparently the weekend we are going is a special weekend (don't remember why), so the price is doubled!

My wife is getting pretty annoyed with my questions right now, I can see it on her face.

I ask her how come we aren't moving the weekend one week back or forwards to get the regular price of the place at around $1500? Or why don't we get a three bed condo instead of a five bedroom penthouse to save money? Or just book into a hotel. At this point it's all academic. I can't check AirBnB for that precise weekend for that place as they've already booked it. I'm seriously tempted to contact the owner.

I don't really get an answer on this one, so I ask the main thing that's bothering me. Who is going, if we are paying a third of the cost of five bedroom 'penthouse villa' but we are only using three rooms. I ask, is it your younger brother (birthday boy), and your parents and us?

My wife replies no, it's actually her brother (and wife) whose birthday it is, her parents and her older sister. So wait, I ask, why isn't she staying in the fourth room? Apparently she's just going to stay in her parents room on the pullout couch.

Which means two things. One, my wife's parents have got the biggest room by far. Two, no way is the sister going to actually stay in on a day bed when there is an empty room. but she gets out of paying. She's not broke, makes a decent amount as a CPA.

Then I ask the question that I've been waiting to ask. Is your brother Jimmy and his wife coming? The answer is no. A definite no. In fact, my wife said, she would have preferred if her alcoholic youngest brother came, as we could have split the costs!

From past experience of paying for this freeloader to go on family vacations, I can see exactly the same thing is happening again. My wife's family seem to take great pleasure in getting us to pay for most everything we do together and my wife will say nothing.

At this point I'm angry at my inlaws and my wife. Every single time Jimmy and his wife wasn't supposed to be coming on a trip they turned up. Every time her family come to see us, we end up paying for restaurant bills and gas money for them.

We aren't talking about broke people here. We are talking about well paid professionals who have bad money management and like to live like they are Kardashians!

My wife tells me I should just be happy to spend time with her family, and to quit worrying. Jimmy isn't coming (gets said every time) and her older sister will sleep in her parents room. She tells me to quit being an asshole and she would do the same for my parents.

Except she doesn't. We see her parents for a full weekend. I find it hard, but it's important so I do it. My wife won't visit my parents for more than a few hours. I get different reasons why - but right now its because they smoke. My parents majorly cut back when I told them this and had the place professionally cleaned. Even she admits it's better. She's happy for me to drop our kids off with my parents when we need some time, or a babysitter. She doesn't even come with me most times to pick out kids up!

She's seen my parents for a couple of hours a time four times this year. I'm looking at close to two full weeks with my inlaws.

I feel like we are getting off topic, but when she claims she would happily go on vacation with my parents that just doesn't feel true to me. We've been on vacation with them once, for five days in 2013. She acts like things are fair and equal but they just aren't. She's made it difficult as hell to organise another vacation with my family.

The conversation ends with my wife saying she's sick of me being paranoid. That I don't have a right to know how many rooms the place is or how much it was, just what we have to pay. That they got an incredible deal on amazing place in Vegas and I should be happy.

I feel, privately that:

\- My brothers 27th birthday is way OTT but that's his business. I should have been informed of the scale of this birthday before being asked to agree to it so we could make an informed decision.

\- Like four other vacations with my wife family, Jimmy isn't coming. Until he is.

\- Getting a penthouse that is twice the price when we could halve it by moving it one weekend is insane

\- Getting a five bedroomed place when we only need three is just manipulation. My wife's sister is going to take one room , and Jimmy will take the other for sure.

I've suggested we stay at a hotel on the strip to sort this issue out. My wife says no, we go and we pay a third, or she goes without me.

My wife has told me if I have an issue to take it up with her mother, and if Jimmy shows up, make it clear there and then that it's not fair. There's no way I want to do that, it was cause a major argument. I figure my wife knows this as well, and that's why she wants to portray this as ""shut up and deal with it, or tell my mother"". She's betting I'll just fall into line.

Or, I can stop attending family events and pull her family apart, as she puts it."
40,"Me (30M) with my wife (30F) of two years, wife had a public freakout on a crowded train


So.... for the past couple years, I've felt like my wife has two sides to her...

There's a joyful, confident, upbeat person.

Then there's an angry and hostile person.

The ""first her"" is of course when we get along best. Even then, lately sometimes her happiness seems a little too forceful? Like she is trying to prove something. I don't know.

I suspect she may be depressed. I'm writing this for advice on how to suggest this to her so she can feel better. What I'm about to write is going to make her look really bad but it's gotten clear to me most people don't act like this. Something's going on.

What happened was, last night on the metro, we were sitting but my wife doesn't quite fit in one seat on a train, she takes more like a seat and a half. The train was jampacked at this time with lots of people standing. There were some people in front of us holding on to the bar above us. One of them said annoyed to another, ""jesus, that woman is taking up two seats.""

My wife overheard this. She flew into a complete rage. I'm not talking something like just telling them off for being rude.

She started screaming at them and cursing. She kicked the legs of the guy who made the comment. She was yelling that they were disgusting, entitled, and hateful. She got so worked up her face was red and she was sweating.

Luckily those people got off at the next stop (probably to get away from her.) She stopped yelling then but still kept ranting to me about it all the way home.

All this got stares from everyone around us. Extremely embarrassing.

The problem is this is not very uncommon for her... there's been multiple instances like this. A lot of times, they're over things people do that objectively aren't even offensive.

She gets snappy at restaurant workers and people in customer service positions. She rolls her eyes, sighs a lot, tells them they're doing a poor job, and makes demands they're unable to meet. She physically pushes her way past people sometimes. She sits on people's belongings on the train. She complains about people as though they're not there to hear her.

I'm forced to face the dismay that my wife has become one of those people who acts embarrassing in public and is totally oblivious to it. The ones you see on youtube in ""public freakout"" videos. No awareness of herself or others, oversensitive and overreacting.

I have desperately reached deep within my soul trying to summon the spark I once felt towards her, but I simply cannot muster an ounce of attraction to this.

I also have reason to believe she's even worse when I'm not with her, judging by some smug stories she's told on social media. Everything mentioned above are the things I've seen for myself.

She will make posts sometimes along a theme of how someone did something in public that annoyed her, and she did something back to put them in their place. She's very condescending in these stories, sometimes arguments she gets into show up on my feed and I'll see her telling internet strangers ""deal with it, sweety"" or ""die mad about it"" if someone criticizes her. She looks very childish in these conversations.

A recent example was apparently she thought a stranger was judging her for eating fast food, so she confronted the woman saying something like ""Maybe if you ate more you wouldn't be a skeleton upset by the sight of someone enjoying a meal."" She gave no explanation of how she knew this person was judging her. But the post got a dozen comments from online friends of hers all praising her.

Sorry this is getting so long, this ties into the other side of her now.

In these posts and other times around me and people we know, she also has the positive confident personality I mentioned. She's incredibly sure of herself, thinks she can accomplish anything, and honestly sometimes borders on arrogance.

She's accused people of being jealous of her. She talks about being comfortable with her body enough to wear what she wants, but puts down other women for their own bodies and clothing. Her self-described 'anthem' is a song whose lyrics are how she loves herself and other people must want to be her.

Whenever I try to talk to her about where the angry moments come from, she denies anything is wrong. She says her life is great and she's happy with where she is so why would she be upset.

She says she doesn't let other people bring her down. Isn't it possible to do that without lashing out at them for no reason?

I'm finding it increasingly hard to understand her. Not to mention, the rudeness in public puts me in a very awkward position. These people just going about their day don't deserve it. Her aggression shows a side of her I find very unkind.

How do I handle these mood swings, especially around others? What are some ways to delicately bring this up so she doesn't go on defense immediately but will open up to me about whatever's causing it?

And answering likely questions: together for 6 years and married 2, no kids, and no she hasn't always been like this.

TL;DR: I don't know how to deal with my wife's poor treatment of strangers. She insists she's fine and nothing is wrong."
41,"I [30M] want my MIL [50F] to move out if she doesn't want to babysit my kids [8F, 10F]


I need some guidance on this situation, because I'm pretty hot about the whole thing so I don't wanna say/do something I'll regret.  

&amp;#x200B;

My MIL (Beatriz) divorced her husband (not my wife's Dad) last year.  Everything is now said, done, and over with, but she had to move out of their marital home because they sold it and split the very small profit.  I was asked if she could move in with us on a temporary basis for a month, max.  She was supposed to rent something small/cheap for old people, or move in with a friend...both options were in the works, she just needed a stopgap.  I said OK.  Our house is nice and big, we've got a Casita (I don't know if thats a common term...its like a mini studio apartment thats on the property.  Own bedroom, own bath, plus a sink and fridge.  Also has its own entrance)  that I rent on Air BnB, or use as a guesthouse.  She is living here completely bill/rent free.  She doesn't really have income, just the $20k or whatever she got from the sale of the house.  I also need to mention that she's an immigrant who has never worked a full time job before (just part time stuff) but she is fully capable of doing so, and legally able to.  She also does not speak English that well, and we live in the US.

&amp;#x200B;

Well its been almost 4 weeks and she's still here with no move-out date in sight.  Since I'm not an idiot, I told my wife (Estefania) she needs to talk to her Mom by today to find out what her plan is, because once she stays over 30 days she now qualifies for some tenants rights and thats not a problem I'm interested in.  Estefi immediately tells me Beatriz can't find a place yet so its going to be a few more weeks, at least.  How do you already know that, but I dont?  OK, whatever.  Thats fine, she can stay here longer, but she needs to contribute.  The only contribution I'm interested in is she can pick our daughters up from school from Mon-Thurs and watch them from 2:30p til 6:30p.  Currently, both Estefi and I have flexible jobs so we alternate this task...but the problem is we need to make up the work we miss on the nights/weekends so it never feels like we get real family time.  We've had Nannies before with varying degrees of success, but as any other parents can attest to, its difficult to find someone both trustworthy to watch your kids as well as be reliable and responsible.  

&amp;#x200B;

Estefi took my stipulations to her Mom (pick the kids up from school at 2:30 p from Mon to Thurs, watch them til 6:30p.  This will be your contribution for living here rent/bill free).  Beatriz was not happy with that arrangement.  She marched over to the main house and started yelling at me in person, in Spanish.  The whole point of Estefi going over there by herself to tell her this was to leave me out of it.  I don't want to be involved in your family dynamics, but I will be involved in my household decisions.  So that was definitely bothersome.  

&amp;#x200B;

I don't speak Spanish but I understand enough.  Beatriz ""explains"" to me how hard it was for her to raise Estefi after her Dad died and all that she sacrificed.  How she found a new husband...all this shit I don't care about.  Essentially, in their culture Estefi is supposed to take care of her Mom to repay her for all of Beatriz's sacrifices.  Beatriz tells me she loves her nietas but she is not going to be responsible for picking them up/babysitting everyday....only in emergency situations.  I told her that I love her too, but I'm not going to be responsible for taking care of her or any other grown ass adult.  So she either does it, or she needs to move out, and I'd have her shit on my front lawn plus a bus ticket back to Mexico by the end of the weekend.  

&amp;#x200B;

I understand my response was crass.  But I was especially angry at the fact that Estefi was pretty much backing her Mom up when she was saying we need to take care of her.  A lot of things started to make sense at that point...all of this might have been planned.  I'm not sure if my actual ultimatum is fair or not.  

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR  MIL says since I married her daughter, that means I agreed to take care of MIL.  Thats fine, but I want her to agree to a schedule in which she babysits for 1/ 2 a day, 4 days a week, plus emergencies.  She wont agree to that.  My Wife is on my side, but says we all need to compromise.  I say no compromise, she needs to leave."
42,"All of our friends including my husband (29m) are in our friends wedding party but I (26f) was excluded


So my husband (29m) and I (26f) have a group of friends that we hang out with and travel with pretty often. We’re a set of four couples. I’ve always felt kind of like an out cast of the group. The girls will all get together at a party to take pictures together but have never been asked me to join. I am a pretty big introvert and have different interests but have always thought we were all friends. 

Last time I saw the bride we were at her house bbqing and drinking. She told me I would be a bridesmaid in her wedding because we’re friends and my husband is going to be a groomsman. I went on to their wedding website to check out their registry and saw the wedding party listed. I was not on that list. My feelings are pretty hurt and I am just think how awkward I’m going to feel sitting by myself while my friends and husband are taking wedding photos.

I guess I just needed to write it out, I’m too embarrassed to talk to my husband about it because it seems trivial.

Tl;dr my husband is in our friends wedding but I’ve been excluded"
43,"My [35F] husband [38M] is . . . obsessively buying groceries??


In the last couple of months, my husband has started buying groceries excessively. I know, odd first world complaint. But he has probably spent $1000 on mostly just junk food, odds and ends, new products, snack food, ice cream, etc. We have a small kitchen and small pantry, so I've started trying to organize this stuff on the counters, which is a pain. He goes to the grocery store almost daily, even without a set reason, and comes home with all kinds of stuff. 

 He is very thin, our kids are thin, and I'm on the chubby side of normal BMI. So we don't eat a ton of extra food, and the perishable stuff often isn't eaten before it goes bad. I've made jams out of a lot of the fruit and frozen the excess baked goods when there's room, but not everything gets used. And he takes this as a personal insult. Huffy, angry, acting unappreciated. If he comes across a non-perishable that hasn't been eaten, he still gets upset that nobody's had it yet. I've told him many times ""Look, honey, we like all these things, but we just can't actually eat all this food that fast. You have to stop bringing home more groceries."" This just makes him more upset and he continues bringing home even more things. Even the older two kids have noticed and mentioned there's no more room for food and ""Dad really needs to quit buying this stuff.""

I know there are some mental health issues at play, extreme stress and a trauma last year. But he won't seek help for that, so I'm currently stuck, buried under endless groceries. I don't foresee any actual change happening; I don't know the motivation, and I hate food waste.

Should I keep telling him we can't eat more and to just stop it? Should I just start taking the excess to the food bank? Should I try to make lists of food we actually need to satisfy the urge? Are the latter two enabling?

Tl;dr: husband is obsessively buying groceries we can't eat fast enough or have room for - do I keep confronting him, or just start donating it?"
44,"I (F27) slapped my (M28) husband twice during a fight and I dont know how to make it right


TL;DR during a fight with my husband I slapped him at two different points. I messed up and I dont know how to fix it.

That description makes me sound horrible and its because I am. I know that I'm 100% in the wrong for this. Violence and abuse are never the answer and I've never resorted to this before. I just need help making this right. 

My husband surprised me with a fun pub crawl for the night and we had an amazing time. When we got home he got in my face and was asking how much I think he spent for the night and saying he did this all because I keep pestering him to do fun stuff in the city we live in before we move out of the country next month.

The thing is that I've asked for three specific things I'd like to do with him, one of which is free and the other two would cost less than $20 per person. Yes I'm pretty much financially independent on him here but when he tells me he doesn't want to do things because of money I agree and drop my request.

So I was super surprised when he planned this guided pub crawl tonight which I never asked for or even mentioned. Once we got home he, out of the blue, started getting in my face about how much he spent on the night and blaming my desire to do fun things, I pointed out that I never even thought of doing this pub crawl. He put his face an inch from mine and said ""are you fucking stupid"" and I slapped him.

I left the room, five mins later he came in and kept saying the same stuff. I blatantly ignored him and he slapped my phone out of my hand, screaming that he paid for it.

After I ignored him more he backed off and I apologized for slapping him. He cut me off mid apology, told me it was fake and it sounded like a ""but"" was coming, and then we got into a fight about how I'm a feminist and I shouldn't do that. I kept agreeing and saying that it was horrible and wrong. 

The fight then circled back to the money issues and the pub crawl and every time I tried to say something he kept LITERALLY screaming in my face and not even letting me finish a sentence. 

After several minutes of this and not being able to get a word in while he waved his hands in my face, slowly pushed my cheek to demonstrate the slap I did (he did it three times), hitting me in the face with his shirt, and screaming at me not even an inch from my face... I slapped him again... and he said he's incredibly hurt I'd abuse him like this and I agree that it was the worst thing I could ever do.

I know he's 100% wrong as far as the argument goes but its NEVER ok to resort to violence and the fact that I did kills me. I don't know what to do. 

Where do I go from here?"
45,"My [19M] aunt [45F] said it wasn't appropriate of me to accept hugs or cuddles from my cousin [9F].


We live very close by and I even though we don't see each other every week, I see then probably twice a month either on visits or family get togethers.

My cousin (45F's daughter) is very friendly and is always willing to talk and share random stuff. She's also very physically affectionate. Sometimes she jumps family members when they greet each other, and other times she gets close to people when hanging out or watching TV.

Last weekend we were at a supermarket (aunt, cousin, another older cousin and me) buying stuff for a birthday that day. Most of the time, 9F was close to me, hugging me around the waist in a friendly way and holding my hand and showing me stuff she wanted us to get. 

Later, while getting things ready, my aunt made a comment about how she didn't think it was proper or appropriate of me to accept that contact from my cousin. I said that it was all, you know, friendly and that she started it on her own so I thought it was Ok to give back the love.

She gave me a very weirded out look, denied with her head and pretty much repeated what she said before.

So, I don't know what I shoud do. On one hand, I find it a little ridiculous of her to suddnely say that. On the other, she's the mom so I can't go over her decisions.

What should I do if my cousin wants to hug me next time we see each other?

**tl;dr:** Aunt says I shouldn't accept my cousin's (her daughter) physical affection because she doesn't think it's appropriate. What should I do next my cousin wants to hug me or show other kinds of physical affection?"
46,"My teenage daughter (13,F) no longer wants to spend time with her father (31,M) and I (30,F) am having a difficult time communicating with him regarding what needs to change.


Long story short, I had my eldest young and her father and I didn't make it as a couple past high school graduation. Fortunately, we were able to remain civil and have been fairly decent co-parents (in my opinion, at least). In the past, he has had 2 weekends of custody time per month, but in the last few years that has changed to one 3 day weekend where he picks her up from school Friday, she spends the weekend with him, he takes her to dinner after school on Monday and drops her off Monday night. This has worked out fairly well until the last 6 months.

&amp;#x200B;

My daughter has been complaining about spending the weekend at her father's more and more. Some of the things she complains about are things she just has to deal with and I don't really hold it against him for various reasons, but there have been a lot of valid complaints. For instance, she tells me that he has been dating casually (he got out of a LTR last year) and the women that he brings over while she's there are a mix of rude, overbearing, or just surprised and unsettled to see he had a kid he didn't tell them about (wtf!). I think it's completely unfair to her to have to have those interactions, especially because she is only there for one weekend. 

&amp;#x200B;

She really liked his ex-girlfriend, who in my opinion seemed like a really nice person, but since they broke up her father has been bad-mouthing her and saying some hurtful things that my daughter is having a hard time processing. I talked to him about this and reminded him that we agreed to never talk badly about each other to her and that should also apply to other relationships we may be in/out of and he agreed, but anytime she mentions his ex he still gets angry. This happens even if she's just answering a question (ex/ ""who bought you that bracelet?"" ""Kelly did"" cue anger)

&amp;#x200B;

Another major issue is that he wrecked his car and cannot currently afford a new one. This is not alone an issue, as we live in a metro area and there is adequate public transit for the most part. He picks her up from school on the bus, which she hates, but that is one of the things she's just has to deal with. The real issue comes into play with her weekend extracurriculars. A lot of her events are well within an hour's drive time, but by taking public transit it's unfeasible (as in, 2.5 hours with multiple busses/trains). She has had to miss multiple events, and the last weekend she spent with him I ended up spending almost $200 on Uber for her to get there and back. I've talked to her dad about short term car rentals (again, we're in a huge city and there are Zip cars and the like everywhere) but it comes down to the ultimate problem here: he seems super depressed and unwilling to change. 

&amp;#x200B;

They have been fighting more and more, which my ex completely chalks up to her being a teenager. I call bullshit because I think for the most part she is very reasonable and capable of analyzing a situation. Nobody is perfect, even my kids, but I cannot imagine her just starting fights with her dad over nothing. She seems to hate it, and convincing her to go for the weekend is exhausting for us both. I have talked to her father about a dozen times over the past few months about their arguments, his issues, etc. This is more than we have ever talked, literally in the entire time I've known him. They got along well when she was younger, we would text each other pictures occasionally, and that's how we kept things so civil. 

&amp;#x200B;

Any advice on communicating in this scenario? I feel like I try to remain as dispassionate as possible when I talk to him, but he comes across as so arrogant like he couldn't possibly be doing anything wrong and it's very difficult. For example, the last time we spoke I asked him if he felt that it was possible to not have any women over on her weekend until he gets to know somebody a little better and he makes sure that they get along with our kid. He just started laughing and said that our daughter needs to get over his break-up and he's not going to let a teenager run his dating life. It's like he has no ability to be perceptive. I really don't think my daughter gives a shit about his dating life, I just think she doesn't want to be forced to be involved with it. 

&amp;#x200B;

Unless things get significantly worse, I'm not going to pursue changing the custody agreement. My daughter wants to have a good relationship with her father, I want her to, and it seems like he is the only person who is not motivated to make this happen. That and he already has so little time with her. He seemed like a much better person while he was in his previous relationship, at this point I'm really hoping he meets another nice woman and this just passes like a hiccup, but I also have a feeling his issues are more subversive than that...

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR: 13 yr old no longer wants to spend time with her father because they argue and she doesn't feel comfortable at his house. I am somehow failing to communicate the issues to him as nothing has changed and many things are getting worse."
47,"I (26f) found videos my husband (28m) took of my sister at a fourth of July family event. He broke down, begged for forgiveness after I brought it up... and I just feel confused.


This is weird to say the least. I'm not sure what to think at this point.


Me and my husband have been together since high school, and we got married when I was 22 and he was 24. He is absolutely my DREAM man and I wouldn't of traded him for anything. I love him to death. I've never questioned his love or loyalty for me period, so this is just... A weird situation I've run into.


This last fourth of July, my entire family got together and celebrated at a local spot in our city. There were tons of activities and things to do, and it was amazing.


At one point, me and my husband and two of my younger sisters were in line to do a prize wheel. Right next to us, was a second line for a prize wheel as well. So there were two. In that line, was my sister, my dad and two younger brothers. I vividly remember this when it happened.


Me and my husband were hugging, joking, laughing and having fun while we were waiting. He was hugging me and kissing on me, and it was just nice. I was absolutely in heaven.


Well, that memory has been completely tainted as of today though, and now I'm extremely sad and in a weird place mentally.



I was going to go through Google Photos and look for a specific time in July, but couldn't remember when. I just searched July, and looked through everything.


I saw a video and the preview of it was obviously my sister. I instantly recognized it, and remembered it was from the fourth because of her outfit. I thought it must have been an accident that I took somehow?


Then... I realized next to that one... Were about 5 others. I played them and realized it wasn't me that took it... They had to of been my husband's videos. The sound was of me and my husband talking, kissing etc and the videos were solely focused on my sister standing in line.


I felt weird about it and asked him as soon as he got home, and he broke down and apologized. I was broken, because part of me thought it HAD to of been an accident. He didn't know it was recording. Totally unintentional. But nope. It was on purpose.


He cried and begged me to forgive him, he apologized a million times and swore he'd never do it again and ""he didn't know why he even did"".


I'm confused and just lost right now. I don't feel the same about him suddenly and I'm scared. I've loved this guy for years and years. He's the only guy I've known as an adult. He's my soul mate.


Now I'm sitting here... Hes next to be sleeping, and I almost feel disgusted. He took a video of my sister waiting in line. A moment that should've been innocent, he ruined it.


He was kissing on me, hugging me, whispering in my ear how he loves me.... And recording my sister. I feel like I'll never see him the same again.


I don't know what to do. I've been with this guy for years and years, we're trying to start a family of our own. We're in love.


On one hand I feel like it's too much to just throw what we have away.... But on the other hand, I feel weird toward him now. Like he's a stranger or something. I don't know :( please help.


Tl;dr; found videos my husband took of my sister at a family event. She was just waiting in line like we were. I feel weird and don't see him the same... But we've been together since high-school and I don't know that I should throw it away over this. I'm so confused. So conflicted. Someone please help me :("
48,"My [24F] boyfriend [25M] of 6 years gets frustrated with me for sleeping during the day. I work the night shift.


My boyfriend and I have a very good relationship, but we have a problem that came up.

I work the night shift (11pm-7am) at a hospice center. My boyfriend is in grad school, he has his PhD defense in November. He is undoubtedly stressed out and I’ve been doing everything I can to help him (doing extra chores, cooking, etc.) but I’m wondering if he’s being unreasonable about this. 

When I get home I sleep from about 8am_3pm. My boyfriend has expressed that he feels frustrated knowing that I’m sleeping/watching me sleep on the bed (we have a 1 room apt) while he has to sit at his desk to work. He thinks it’s “unfair”. 

I don’t know wtf I’m supposed to do about this. I can’t not sleep. 

How do we resolve this? Thank you. 

**tl;dr** boyfriend is frustrated that I sleep during the day but I work the night shift"
49,"I think my [27F] dad [62M] is lying about odd things, and I'm not sure how to cope


Bear with me, this might get long.

I love my dad, but he's always been quite a 'difficult' man. He was a fantastic and involved dad until I was around 10 or so, but he then seemed to have no idea how to relate to me any more. (My mum, brother and I always joke that he knew what to do until we started having opinions of our own.) 'Emotionally available' he was not. As a teenager it became clear to me that he was depressed - he shut himself away, he didn't want to interact, he seemed miserable and angry. He used to do things which I felt were irrational, but I quickly understood were about him feeling in control. He grew up working class, in a deprived area with little opportunity. He was encouraged by his family to find a 'way out' in order to have a 'better life', and he managed to get into university, then moved away and stayed away. He got good jobs, made good money. A lot of his identity seems to be focused around 'escaping' his upbringing and defining himself in opposition to it, and his main measure of success is money &amp; appearance. I remember that when we went to visit his family once, he rented a more expensive car for the week, so that his family would think he was doing well.

It was when my parents split up (I was about 17) that things I felt might be lies started escalating. He would do things like say his company was relocating him to Australia, and then give us no information about when that would happen - I'd message saying to tell me when he was flying so I could see him off, but then I'd get a text saying he was at the airport waiting at the gate. But then the relocation would never really happen. He'd be back in the UK, and the relocation would be off, never really spoken about again. It happened again with America - he'd give details of the flat his company was renting him, go and visit, tell me about meeting with his boss, and then... he'd be back. I found these 'lies' (?) kind of understandable, because I can easily imagine these things were down to him feeling depressed and abandoned, and wanting to know people cared for him. In this period he also had poor health, including two heart attacks. Rather than telling as at the time, he would text days later to tell us he'd been in hospital, but then wouldn't reply when we wanted to come visit or help.

Over the years, things have got more odd. He claimed to have bought land on a fairly remote island, with the plan to build a house and retire there. We suggested that with his health, a remote island might not be ideal. Over the months he would talk about planning permission and architects, failed plans and successes, possibly throwing in the towel. Recently he's said the house is nearly built - but has no photographs or plans to show us, and now he says he's had someone interested in buying it. It started to remind me of the 'farm' he said he'd had when we were growing up. We never saw it, just heard about it. When I spoke to my mum about it, she said he'd talked about it with her but never had photographs, and when she'd wanted to visit it he'd brushed it off. Eventually it was 'sold', though she said she never saw any evidence he'd got any money for it. She said she wasn't sure if it even ever existed. He's made other claims - for example, that he'd bought the maintenance contract for the block of flats he lives in. When I last asked about that, he'd 'sold' that as well. 

The final straw for me was that he was apparently overheard by someone who knows my mum, talking loudly in public about how he might become a millionaire due to something happening with shares in his company. He usually absolutely does not discuss these kinds of things in public, it's very much more things he tells me or my brother, so this is (more) unusual behaviour. He has not talked about this with me or my brother either. I don't know if these are lies, or things which genuinely just don't come to fruition, and I find the motivation behind lying about these things much more difficult to understand. If they are lies, what does he get out of them? Does the fact he's lying more publicly indicate a worrying change? Has anyone else dealt with this? It feels terrible to wonder whether all the 'big things' (like heart attacks) might be lies, and I'm genuinely worried this might signal something in his mental health worsening.

**TLDR:** My dad has a history of depression, and over the years has made many claims which always come to nothing. Recently the lies (?) are more money-related (e.g. owning things which there doesn't seem to be any evidence of him owning) and have now become public, not just kept within family. Why is he lying like this? How can I tell?"
50,"My friend [28/f] chastised me [28/f] for using condoms with my husband [30/m]. She got her fiance [m?] involved


I’ve been married now for three years and my husband and I use condoms as a form of birth control and have been for the past two years.

I didn’t think anything of this until I had a friend visit yesterday and she found a condom wrapper in one of the guest bathrooms. Usually we’d check for things like this before guests come over but this was an unexpected visit. 

Instead of ignoring it as any decent person would do, Anne told me in a very rude tone that she doesn’t understand why married people would use condoms and said what’s the purpose of being married if you’re going to use condoms. She went on until I told her to stop. 

I was on the pill for many years and I first started when I was 15 because of endometriosis. When I was 17, I tried the depo shot and it was fine for a few months but then I had extremely painful spotting and other side effects and had to stop. I got back on the pill and when I went to college I tried the depo shot again to see if maybe it would be better for me years later but it wasn’t.

When I was 21 and had my first pap smear, I asked my doctor about an IUD but the sounding was extremely painful for me and then my body expelled it which was even more painful. I was devastated because I felt like I wen through pain for no reason.

My doctor told me that she could give me a new one but my body had a high chance of rejecting it again so I just went back on the pill. The pill had been wonderful for so long but a few years ago I started to get extremely nauseous on the pill and had bad migraines. A year ago, my periods started lasting for a month at time and no matter what brand my doctor gave me, I’d have the extended bleeding which sucked with my endo. The last straw was when I started having heavier bleeding to the point that I was using an overnight pad every hour. My doctor found a small fibroid and said that she wanted me off of hormones because it could get bigger. 

My husband had been wanting me to stop the birth control for a while because I was so miserable and it’s been two years now since I’ve been off of birth control and I feel so much better! My husband is adamant that we spend at least another year traveling before we have kids and I feel the same and that’s why we use condoms. 

Today Anne invited me to lunch and I told her that I’d join her but she needed to know that her comments were inappropriate.

Despite this she made several comments about how her and her fiancé don’t use condoms and that she talked to him about it and he said it’s weird and that my husband doesn’t feel anything during sex with me. I left the lunch at that point because I don’t need to know her fiancé’s opinions on my sex life and she has her own problems with him that she needs to focus on.

I really want to just block Anne’s number but I’ve known her since high school and I don’t know if I’m overreacting. If I had only known her for a year, this would be easier for me. The tone she said all of this was like she was disgusted. 

&amp;#x200B;

\*\*Tl;Dr:\*\* Friend found a condom wrapper in my house and chastised me for using condoms with my husband. I asked her to stop speaking about my sex life but she told her fiance who added his own opinions. Because of all of this, I want to just end my friendship with Anne but I don't know if it would be too nuclear."
51,"My (F26) friend (F24) and her BF(M28) were caught 'red-handed' breaking a shelf at my wedding. She denies it and I'm not sure how to move on.


This past weekend I got married in a historical venue, and as most venues I was required to pay the fee of renting + a security deposit withheld for damages. The wedding went great, and at the end of the night we cleaned up everything quickly and made our way out. 

After asking about a missing item Monday, Tuesday I received an email back saying that there had been some damage done to the original mantelpiece above a vanity mirror, and attached images. Unfortunately, since it was part of the original house, the director of the venue and the events coordinator decided to take the entire sum of the security deposit to cover it. They didn't want to inform us (or anyone) at the wedding, to not ruin the mood. This piece of furniture was in the bridal suite, which was located on a separate floor of the venue, not accessible to other guests.

According to the venue coordinator, she saw two people wandering on the floor, and told them there weren't any bathrooms there. She then went back to the office, heard a crash bang, and came back to the bridal suite to see them **holding the broken shelf**. This room was well-lit. My husband then called her asking for a description, because we did not hear back from any guests that this happened. She described them, then we sent photos of the guests and she positively identified two on a photo circling and emailing us back. There were only 50 guests, there is no way that she would have confused them for anyone else.

We confronted these guests and they vehemently deny this. Although they said they went upstairs to fix makeup, both say they absolutely did not break the shelf. It is very out of character for them to be destructive like this and continue lying. I talked to my friend and she has maintained her story, though some parts are a little hazy with her adding details. With the coordinator so sure, I'm at a loss of what to do, the situation is obviously very black/white, with one party definitely lying.  At this point, I'm willing to swallow the cost, and move on as the shelf is broken. However I'm not quite sure how to maintain our relationship, as I don't want to cut her out of my life but I can't see why the coordinator would make such a blatant lie (but also why couldn't they flag this for us at the end of the night, after the wedding?) We also have a lot of mutual friends that were there that night, which will raise questions. 

TL;DR -  My friend and her bf were supposedly caught 'red-handed' with the broken shelf at a venue. The venue reached out 3 days later to let us know that we would not receive our security deposit back, and after prying, identified the two people who broke it. They completely deny breaking it and I'm not quite sure what to do."
52,"My wife (33F) pushed for having a child even though I (36M) didn't want one. We had one and I definitely regret it. Struggling with regret and resentment and what to do from here.


We both wanted a child-free life prior to marriage. However life happens and opinions change and she broke the news to me that she wanted a child not even a year into marriage. We fought for 2 years. Not yelling and screaming. Neither of us are like that. But any time we'd go out to eat or celebrate a b-day or anniversary, shed being up wanting a child. I didn't want one. I was very bad at communicating, most of the time I'd just completely shut down and not want to talk about it. But I guess in my mind i had let her know and that was that. I did not seek help or advice which was a terrible idea that I regret very much. She on the other hand spent the time trying to convince me to have a kid. She'd say we'd make it work, and that her sister can't get pregnant and odds are good she can't either so let's see what happens, etc. Eventually I just broke. I was so fucking tired and just needed an end. I was naive in thinking there had to be a compromise. I said that if we were to have a kid and I was giving up my ideal future then I needed her to give up her career (and mine too) and we'd move back home a state away and start a new life close to our friends and family. Yes, I realize now that's not a compromise and a bad idea. Well she agreed. And got pregnant. And then threw out agreement out the window and got her dream job.  When she broke the news she was pregnant, rather than be excited as a normal husband would, I just left and went for a long jog and cried half way through. I knew I fucked up.

During pregnancy we upgraded living situation (money was one of a million issues for me and I was nervous about finances but so far we're ok). And everything was a blur. I was numb. When the baby was born there was a health scare and it choked on fluids and actually wasn't breathing for several minutes and technically died. I saw its lifeless body and my torn open wife bleeding all over the operating table and time just froze. I wasnt sad. To be honest I thought everything was ok and was playing out as was meant to be. I felt a brief feeling of relief in possibly not having to be a father. But the hospital staff was fucking incredible and saved the baby and it was sent to NICU for a week for a full recovery. Its a perfectly healthy and beautiful child in every regard.

But for the longest time I felt NO connection. None. After a year I knew something was wrong. I hit a bad depression for the first time in my life, drank a lot, did and said some absolutely terrible things, destroyed my marriage (had an affair which weve moved on from and shes forgiven me for) and had suicidal thoughts daily. I eventually sought help with therapy and it was tremendously helpful. I put a huge focus on Bettering myself, learning how to effectively communicate so I don't find myself in another lose/lose situation and don't know what to do and most importantly I learned how to be a good father. I applied some techniques like basically just putting my phone down, eliminating distractions and playing with my daughter. pretending to be a good dad. But really seeing how my interactions benefit her, how she learns, how I can make her laugh, etc. It really worked. I'm proud to say I am actually a fucking good dad. Its just something I have to constantly remind myself of and continue to put the effort in  

The problem now is that i still regret it. I harbor major resentment towards my wife. I'm mad that we didn't have any plan in place in case I regretted it. There is basically NO online resources for people like me. I guess because no one is as stupid as I am (I was in love and ultimately I did what I did because I wanted her to be happy). My thoughts get going and I have bad thoughts that she lied to me before marriage and knew she wanted kids, and she manipulated me even though I can't prove that. 

Things between us are pretty bad. We're basically roommates and I am taking care of the kid every other week. Which has proven to be AWESOME. Not just because I get a week off to do what I want which is amazing but when I take care of my child I know she's 100% dependent on me and no one else. 

My wife and I are just fundamentally different. I dont love her right now, nor am I attracted to her. This whole ordeal costed too much. We've had sex once in 2019 and I just don't know how to give her what she needs. I genuinely want her to be happy and I want the best life for my daughter but fatherhood is completely foreign to me since I lived my entire life thinking I'd have a child free life full of travel, focusing on our careers, rescuing animals, fun and few responsibilities.

I think the only way to fix this is to let go of the resentment. We tried marriage counseling but it didn't work too well. We still talk heart to heart about where we're at and that does help but I still feel the way I feel and I feel like I'm wasting everyone's time. I just feel like a big peice of shit. Maybe I am and just need to accept that and let her go and find someone who can make her happy. She wants a family. She wants me. But I just can't seem to let her have that. That's not what I signed up for when I got married and I don't know how to change that attitude so that I can be happy, be a family, continue living in this house, etc. The thought of divorce doesn't scare me. On one had I'd be free from this hell I created and be a part time dad which sounds like maybe that was inevitable since I didn't want kids. On the other hand I don't want to give up hope. I am also scared shitless of being a single dad and affording rent for a shitty apartment. I can't move back to family since I'd be leaving my daughter and now ironically I don't want to do that.

I'm a hot mess. I want to be a good person and do the right thing. I just dont Know what that is. Has anyone known anyone in a situation similar to mine? My wife and I get along great btw, and i am doing what I can to make her feel loved and appreciated and plan date nights. Even though I don't love her as a husband should, she's still the mother of my child and I'll always have love for her for that just not in the husbandly way at the moment. We don't really fight and we have talked divorce frequently but both are stuck. We just want what's best. We know that no matter what happens it will be for the best and we will be awesome coparents. We're both scared of surviving as single parents so probably our biggest deciding factor in continuing to stay and see what happens. Hopefully we can rekindle what we had but it's been so long I don't know when to say enough is enough or if we continue and put the effort in.

TL;DR: wife and I married on same page. She wanted kids, I didnt. We had one anyways. I regret it, even though I did learn how to be a good dad and love my child. Its been a rough few years. I want to learn how to get past resentment and build a better future for myself and my daughter."
53,"My wife [25f] let our son [4m] damage some models of mine [26m] and I'm upset about it. She says I'm being ridiculous.


Okay I'm a little upset with my wife and Id like outside perspective.

So I'm a big fan of the Halo franchise. I dont get to play as much as I used to but I still like the stories and the more.

I own(ed) some models of some of the spaceships from the games, seven in all. Theyre not terribly expensive, but not cheap either. Its just something I like to display and totally not have pretend space battles when I'm home alone or anything. I typically keep them displayed on my computer desk.

Wife and I (married 2 years) have a four year old son. Like most 4 year olds he can be pretty rambunctious and destructive. He also likes spaceships.

He'll ask now and then to play with my models. I always just tell him he can look but they arent to play with. He is pretty good at listening so it has never been a problem.

So anyway. I had to be away from home for a few days for work. When I got back I saw my models were missing from my desk but I figured my wife had moved them to clean or something so I didnt think about it too hard. 

But then my son came running up to proudly show me one of my models. Well, half of one anyway.

I was pretty shocked and asked him if he had the others. He sakd yes and showed me in his room. He had all six. A couple of them were outright destroyed. The others are salvageable but all have pieces broken off or cracks.

At first I got on my son a bit because I assumed he had gotten them himself. I was telling him that he knew they were just to look at etc. Then my wife stuck her head in the room and told me matter-of-factly that she had given him the models to play with.

I just looked at her and asked ""why?"". She told me that he had been throwing a tantrum one day and to quiet him down she promised him he could play with daddy's spaceships if he behaved.

She was telling me this like she saw absolutely nothing wrong with it, but I was pretty upset. I told her she knew that I dont let him play with those since I dont want them broken. 

She acted annoyed that I was annoyed and told me it was no big deal.

I told her it kind of is a big deal. I understand she isnt someone who is into sci-fi or models, but she does know those are my things that I dont want destroyed and she disrespected me by letting our four year old destroy them.

Her response was ""Theyre toys!"" And that she really needed him calmed down since she was alone with him. I told her it was roughly the same as if I had gone into the bathroom and grabbed one of her makeup sets and given it to our son to play with.

She got mad at that and told me that I shouldnt be upset that she gave our son a toy to play with. I told her she knew I didnt want them played with, theyre things I value, and I felt very disrespected that she isnt even acting apologetic for it.

She just said ""Okay, I'm *sorry* your toys got broken!"" And walked away.

That night she gave me a hard time because I was looking online to start getting replacements. She asked why Im spending more money on them. I told her I was getting replacements for my stuff that was broken. 

For the record, I can afford these things. Its not like buying new ones will put us in hardship.

Ever since then weve been avoiding the subject. If it comes up she is upset that I'm still mad. I'm still mad because she isnt even acknowledging that she shouldnt have given my stuff to the four year old.

It isnt really even about the models at this point. Its that she seems to not respect my stuff because its something that she personally isnt into. But she has plenty of things around the home that I dont really understand the appeal of, but I still respect it since its hers and she values it.

So what now? Is it too much to hope for an apology? Am I being ridiculous?
Was it unreasonable to not want my stuff given to our destructive son?

**TL;DR**: My wife gave our destructive son some spaceship models. He destroyed them and I'm upset at her. She thinks Im overreacting."
54,"I [21M] am uncomfortable with my girlfriend’s [21F] stance on birth control and idk if it’s a dealbreaker or not


I want to start off by saying that I don’t think anything she’s done was with malicious intent. So me and my gf have different views on birth. I’m pro-choice and she’s pro-life, so I’m very nervous about her using the pill. She however seems to be very lax with it and we butt heads because of it. She’ll forget to take it sometimes and always tells me not to worry about it. Well we had sex yesterday (we haven’t used condoms for a few months now) and she failed to tell me she had gone 3 days without starting her new pill pack for the month! I got her to take plan B but she’s arguing with me about using condoms for a week, which is recommended what we do on the internet, until she takes a full week of pills again. So I said I don’t want to have sex for the week then but that made her pissy. Now we’ve been dating for about a year, and we had one pregnancy scare in the past when she missed two pills in a row, but those were during the middle of her pack at least. Not forgetting to start a new one like she did now. I’m seriously concerned about her lax/oblivious view towards BC. To be fair she did go to catholic school so they probably didn’t teach her sex Ed well, but I’ve been trying to show her the importance of it. How should I confront my concerns to her? Is this a big enough issue to breakup with her over? I love her a lot but I can’t keep dealing with this and something needs to change.

TL;DR: My gf forgetting to take her pill has caused issues"
55,"My ex bf (30m) and I (27f) adopted a dog together, when I broke up with him he moved to Australia. Now, 1.5 years later, he tells me he’s moving back to the US and wants to be regularly involved with my dogs life. What do I do?


I was with my ex for 4 years, we have now been broken up for 1.5 years. A year before we broke up, we adopted a dog together. Part of the reason we agreed to adopt a dog was because he had recently taken a job that required him to travel for work 3 weeks out of the month and I was getting lonely. 

When we finally did adopt, we both fell absolutely in love with our dog - and the dog loved us both, but it was clear that the dog had a stronger attachment to me since he spent less time with her.

Well, fast forward a year and our relationship fell apart. He traveled so much that I realized I was practically living the life of a single person anyways because I was alone 90% of the time, and I liked it. I moved out of his condo and within a few weeks I had my own place and was settling into my new life. 

I should note here that while I realized I no longer wanted to be with him, I have no ill will towards him. He didn’t do anything wrong, we just weren’t a good match anymore.

For about three months, we went back and forth between our places with the dog. I felt bad for pulling the plug on our relationship, so I basically let him take the dog whenever he was in town and not away for work. This was really difficult on my dog. She did not understand what was happening and the constant moving between homes caused her severe anxiety. During this time she even developed chronic IBS (didn’t realize dogs could get this, but it was horrible). 

While we were going back and forth, the pick ups and drop offs were always according to his schedule. I felt like I was bending over backwards making sure I could be around when it fit his schedule, which I really resented.

My ex eventually took a job in Australia and left for good. Over the past year this dog has been entirely mine. I’ve paid 100% of her food, medication and vet bills. He made it very clear that after he left he would no longer be contributing. He did come to visit a few times and I let her stay with him while he was back for a visit. 

Now to the issue-
Yesterday, he texted me that he has taken a job returning to the city where I live starting in November. He wants to be more involved with her life and is willing to starting contributing financially again. I’m at a loss as to where to go from here.

He has been gone for a long time and we established that the dog was mine. There is nothing stopping me from cutting him out entirely. But my dog loves him and he treats her well so I have a hard time imagining icing him out entirely. And I have to admit that the financial help and occasional weekend off would be nice.

One other complicating factor is that I now have a different boyfriend, we’ve been together for over a year. I can’t imagine he would love the idea of having my ex back in my life regularly. (Also- I’m not worried about my ex trying to get back together with me through the dog. I’m fairly sure he has a gf here and that’s the reason he’s moving back.)

I feel like there is a happy medium where he can be involved somewhat with my dog but not on a regular basis- I’m just not sure how to set this up. 

Does anyone have any insight into how I could set this up in a way that makes sense and is fair? Is a set up like this even what’s best for my dog? Or should I just say fuck it, he moved so he no longer has a right to spend time with her. 

TLDR: my ex moved away for a year and is now moving back. When he returns he wants to be regularly a part of my dogs life again, despite having zero involvement when he left. What is best for my dog?"
56,"My (28F) roommate (29F) offered my room to her friend (24F) and friend's large dog free of charge while I am away for a month. I am livid.


Hey reddit, this is a throwaway. I'm pretty angry but unsure of how to confront my roommate about this issue. We've known each other a year/craigslist roommates and live with 2 other people in a shared house. I'll be gone for a month in November and my roommate has agreed to dog sit for me - I have a small Pomeranian - for $25 a day while I am traveling. I found out today that she offered my room to her friend who is very recently couch surfing/homeless and her friend's husky for the month that I am gone. I am NOT ok with this. Not only is it super unsafe for my dog (huskies have a high prey drive and my small dog hates big dogs), but I am paying FULL rent PLUS HUNDREDS of dollars in dog sitting to her for this period. I do not want some unsafe dog and stranger sleeping in my bed on my expensive bedding making my dog anxious while I am paying TONS of money for this space. Roommate has said friend ""might"" be willing to pay me $100 for the month. That doesn't even cover my goddamn utilities. I am beyond livid that I was even asked but it seems clear that this will happen with or without my approval. There is no way to lock my door when I leave either. Reddit, what do I do?!

&amp;#x200B;

TL;dr: roommate - who is collecting hundreds of dollars in dog sitting from me - offered my bedroom FREE OF CHARGE to her couch-surfing friend and her friend's husky. My tiny dog HATES large dogs. What do I do?!"
57,"My (23F) boyfriend (25M) can’t get over my past


I had been friends with my boyfriend for a year before we started dating. During that year, we were both seeing other people. I was in an exclusive relationship with one person. He was at the end of an on-and off-again relationship with his long time girlfriend, and had been sleeping with several women during the time of our friendship. 

After meeting, we became fast friends. I was even probably his wingman for a few of the nights we went out together. After we started dating, we made plans for me to move 700 miles so we could live together while he was in grad school. I wholeheartedly agreed, but now I’m starting to have doubts. 

We have been dating for about 8 months now, and things have been going really well, except we keep having a recurring argument about my past. He can’t seem to get over the fact that I had dated and slept with people before him (even though he’s dated and slept with 5x more people than I have). Even getting to the point where he wants me to admit that others were just mistakes. I refuse to call them mistakes because they were right for me at the time, and it’s just a part of life. 

I don’t try to make him guilty about his past. I am a little hesitant about the cheating thing, but I don’t make that a regular part of our conversations. Honestly, I am just tired of talking about exes (his or mine) because it doesn’t matter that much to me. I was so excited to move out there to be with him, but these constant little fights are taking away the excitement about a future together. 

He says he realizes this is a double-standard, but he can’t help but be angry about it all the time. I am stumped. How can we move past this?

TL;DR My boyfriend can’t get over my past, and I can’t move in with him until things get better."
58,"I (24 F) lost my dad to cancer and his funeral was yesterday but not one of my best friends attended.


My (24 F) dad passed away a few days ago after a 20 month battle with cancer. I immediately let me best friends (31F, 33M, 32M, and 27M) know of his passing through a group text, which they all responded to with a ""So sorry for your loss"" type message. I sent them the funeral info the next day and not one of them responded.

Yesterday was my dad's funeral and not one of my best friends attended or sent any type of card, flowers, or even contacted me at all. I get it was on a Monday and they had work, but I would have 100% been there for any of them if the situation were reversed or at least let them know I could not attend. We all live within 35 minutes of each other. We have been a group for over 6 years and I was the maid of honor for one of their (31F and 32M) weddings. I am most disappointed in 31F for not reaching out since she lost a mother when she was 19 and must know the excruciating pain and sorrow I am feeling. We all got matching tattoos the day I told them of my dad's cancer diagnosis just to cheer me up, yet no one is here for me when he passes? Hell, even my previous boss and some college friends I haven't spoken to in years showed up the funeral.

I am confused and hurt but do not want to address the issue with my friends until I can separate the grief I am feeling from the disappointment I have for their lack of concern. I love them and don't think they were acting maliciously but I cannot ignore the hurt I am feeling that will not go away until I speak up. Why couldn't they have at least told me they were not going to be able to make it? Or just call me and check on me?

Any advice on how I can address this situation with my friends without coming off as over emotional and irrational?

tl;dr My dad's funeral was yesterday and none of my best friends attended or reached out to me."
59,"My [F32] family wants me to taken in my addict cousin's [F26] kids because I mentioned my partner [M32] and I wanted to adopt soon?


My partner and I already have one kid together, who is about to be two. My pregnancy was really hard on my body and I literally likely wouldn't survive another one, but I've always wanted a big family. So my partner and I thought we should adopt a few kids (ideally a set of siblings). We were also considering older kids (3-8 years old range) because we knew that they had more trouble getting adopted (and because, if we are being honest, they're less expensive to care for). 

Well, I told this to my mom and my aunt casually over dinner the other day. And instantly it became  ""take in your cousin's kids."" Those kids are in and out of the system because my cousin is an opioid addict that is also severely mentally ill. I do not want her kids. One has severe behavioral and developmental issues (he's violent and has the ""mind"" of a three-year-old age six), and the other two are very young and born addicted to drugs (ages 2 and a few months), so I don't have high hopes for their development. I don't want to raise them. I don't want to deal with that mess. I know I am awful. 

My mom and aunt are bullying me to take them in and ""keep them in the family"" and think that it's awful that I would raise a stranger's kids before my own blood. I don't really know what to say. I know raising all kids is hard, but these kids are already set up to be particularly hard.  They are yelling at me for being illogical and cruel. 

I work as a nurse practitioner and my partner runs a small (but fairly lucrative) landscaping company-- two demanding jobs. I don't see us having the time to do all that extra work. All my family sees is a dual income and a lot of money, and thus we are being cheap too (the kids would likely need things like extensive medical care, and possibly special schooling). While we try and save money when we can, it is because we don't want our kids to go into college debt or have to worry about expenses. It's not like we are spending the money on glitzy vacations. We aren't by any means ""wealthy"" but compared to the rest of our families (who were all working-class)  we are rich... which I think is also part of the problem... they assume we can fix everyone else's problems. 

How can I tell them no, without burning bridges? What can I do in the future to prevent hell from breaking loose when we finally do adopt?

TLDR: I said I wanted to adopt kids and now my family wants me to take in my addict cousin's kids, who were are all handful and have confirmed and expected issues that I am unwilling to deal with. Don't really know how to say no and still adopt other children."
60,"BF [33] wants me [22F] to give away my pets so that I can move in with him (rent free), and he refuses to move in with me.


We’ve dated seriously for maybe 6 months. 

I recently got out of an incredibly toxic relationship and he took care of me when my ex was doing some psychotic things (entering my home, stalking me). 

He knew of my pets, had stayed in my home, and has interacted with them in positive ways. I have two cats (bonded pair) and a bearded dragon. Taking care of animals has greatly improved my life due to the loneliness of my situation/depression. I have a natural need to take care of and be a mother to something. Having pets always kept me busy and away from bad habits, and I feel in a way that my identity is some what attached to taking care of animals since it is something I have been doing since my childhood. 

That being said, recently I have been put in a bad situation. I moved to a different state with my now ex where housing is much more expensive. Studio apartments generally run at least $1000 for the bare minimum. I currently pay $1295 a month for my one bedroom apartment. Although I have enough income to take care of myself and my cats, not having a roommate (my ex) has put a lot of pressure on me financially. Although I could try and get a roommate that is accepting of my animals and can stay in the bedroom while I sleep in the “living room,” my current partner has been very adamant that I rehome my pets and move in permanently with him for free (he also doesn’t pay for rent because it’s a work house and about 3+ middle aged men also stay there). I have asked if my pets could stay in the house we live in, but he said that since it’s a shared space, it would be too gross to have animals. Since he doesn’t pay rent, obviously the cheapest option available is the best for him, even if he lives with 3 other men and stays couped up in his tiny bedroom all day when he isn’t working. Even if he would be much more freeing and private to live his own lifestyle if he were to move in with me, he doesn’t want to pay $600 a month even if his salary is more than mine. I have looked for cheaper places but it seems there is no available affordable housing. 

These days he has been saying how he doesn’t like cats because they smell bad. Then he said he hated my bearded dragon and even if she stays in a cage all day, he feels gross looking at her because I purchased her when I was in a different relationship. He’s also been saying some weird things like my family doesn’t love or support me so he doesn’t want to meet them. It also doesn’t help that he is incredibly particular and controlling as far as domestic situations. There are many rules I must abide by if I sleep over, and it leads to me being criticized every day (even if it’s something small like never wears socks in bed or eat outside our shared room alone because it smells or don’t wear moisturizer). 

Moving in permanently with him would mean no pets, I’d share one bathroom with 3 other grown men who don’t speak the same language very well, and I’d have to sell my personal belongings because there is no space in my partner’s room (it’s filled with his own stuff). However, I wouldn’t have to worry about paying an arm and a leg to sleep somewhere. 

I’m at a loss. I have asked for advice from some older coworkers and many people agree with him; get rid of your pets and I’ll be free to live cheaply. No one can see that I feel not only heartbroken at the thought of permanently losing the only family close by, but also that I made a commitment to take care of these animals and they don’t deserve to be tossed from home to home because I decided to take care of them when I was in a seemingly stable situation. I also want to make my partner happy, but it seems like it is at my expense. 

How can I handle this situation? No matter what choice I make, it seems like there is at least one person that suffers. 

TL;DR: Partner wants me to move in with him but wants me to ditch my lizard and two cats (and possibly former life). Not moving in with him would also mean I struggle to survive paying rent alone since I no longer have a roommate and he doesn’t want to move in with me. Don’t know how to make a decision that makes all parties happy."
61,"I’m [25F] a lead teacher and my assistant [50F] hates me/is trying to push me out of my job after working together three weeks.


Hopefully this won’t be too long of a post.

So this year, I got a job as a lead teacher at a preschool, and my assistant is also new at the job. She’s much older than me with some experience as an aide for special education, but I was given lead because my degree is in a child education field whereas hers is something with business administration. I was also given lead over her because she has another job (my boss explained all of this to me). 

So, since day one, she’s pushing me aside for everything and I’m not even sure what words to use for her behavior. For example, she’s really abrasive with the kids, tells them “no” often, and doesn’t really get to their level whereas I try to be communicative and get down on an equal level so I can understand what’s going on. So if a child is upset, they 98% of the time will come to me over her. But when she sees me comforting a child or handling a disagreement between two, she will step in, literally take over and talk over me, pull the child away from me, etc. 


There are many examples of her pushing her way into my job. She will put important paperwork I need from parents in the wrong places in an attempt to file them, put the wrong stuff in the wrong child’s book bags, or try to make things without fully understanding what they’re for (such as an art project placemat for the children’s “dad day” that she was doing incorrectly because she didn’t have all the info about the event, but took upon herself because she saw another class doing it). Then when I ask why she’s doing that, she complains  she has nothing to do while watching me run around with eight 3-year-olds. 

There are also small examples;

While waiting to greet the kids in the morning, I make small talk with another teacher, each of us from our respective doors, and today she physically leaned in front of me like a wall between us, and took over the entire conversation, interrupting me in the process. 

Additionally, she went to sign out and leave for the day, and while I was talking to a parent, she came back in when she saw us and completely hijacked the discussion. She even corrected me on things that I wasn’t wrong about, I just didn’t use language she would use (like I said gummies instead of fruit snacks). This constant policing is killing me. 

On top of that, assistants have shorter hours. I come in early and stay late often to do lesson planning, get training from other leads, prepare for open houses, etc. but she’s always extremely precise about what time she gets to leave and never offers to stay and help. But then when she does come in, she basically tries to run me. She tells me since I don’t have kids, I cannot possible feel empathy or understand how parents feel about things, and my lack of experience makes me second to her.

I’m posting this because confrontation gives me the absolute worst anxiety, I’m diagnosed with military- trauma ptsd, and I just can’t with this woman. I almost quit today cause my mentality is “if she wants lead so bad, she can have it”. Please, help. 

**Also, I’d like to avoid getting my boss involved right away. 

TL;DR: I’m a lead teacher and my assistant is basically bullying me in a very passive aggressive manner, pushing me out of my job, and I don’t know what to do."
62,"After dating me(25M) for 4 monts my girlfriend(23F) reveals she has a child


So this is a throwaway and I will try to keep it short. I have posted this on some other subreddits too I am looking for advice here.

I have been dating this amazing woman for 4 months, everything was and arguably is great, I have introduced her to my parents and everything, the only odd thing during these 4 months that I honestly totally overlooked because our time together was and is amazing is the fact she was a bit shady about her personal life and no dates ever ended at her place but always at my place, added to that she would also sometimes be unavailable for dates or hookups at really odd moments where most people would be available, think saturdays or friday nights.

So this went on for about 4 months, I did not really mind it and it did not cross my mind that something was up as you may imagine, love clouds what would otherwise be an obvious thing to question.

Now yesterday she gave me the news, she invites me to her place(Finally) and she is standing in the doorway with this little girl behind her on the couch, you can imagine what ensues and I wont bore you with the details, but let me just say it was one of the if not the most awkward experience of my life. 

I composed myself because I couldn't exactly start tearing into her with the little kid there and left roughly 10 minutes later after some  angry whispering.

Now I am obviously getting a barrage of messages from everyone and their mother and I am not sure what to do.

On one hand I have fallen in love with her on the other hand I would have never gotten in to a relationship with someone who has a kid, I am quite bad with children and certainly not ready for kids for atleast another 5 to 6 years, let alone ready for someone elses kid. And well the obvious one she lied to me for 4 months I am guessing to rope me in and springing the news on me when I am already invested in the relationship.

So now it is a case of do I break it off and go running for the hills or should I give her a break and a chance?

Tl;dr Girl I have been dating for 4 months invites me to her house and reveals she has a Child with no prior mention."
63,"Live-in BF (35M) broke up with me (36F) out of the blue in a text and now won’t speak to me at all.


My Live-in BF (35M) and I (36F) have been together for 2 years. We’ve formally lived together for 9 months but prior to that he stayed at my place 7 nights a week since a couple of months into dating. 

He left the/his house the other night to go to a planned hobby and texted me about an hour later that he was at his sisters house and wanted me to “pack a bag, take the dogs, and leave” claiming he needed space. I no longer have my separate house. He never goes to his sister’s house. It was extremely out of the ordinary for him to be there. 

I even got a message from his sister saying that she’s never seen him so stressed and just to give him the weekend to chill out. I asked if it could wait until the next day since it was late and I was already in bed and not feeling well (which he knew) and he insisted it be immediate or he was sending his sister to pick up his dog and not coming home. 

I didn’t want to cause more stress and so I had my Dad come pick me and my two dogs up. 

After I left, I got texts saying that he wasn’t in to me and didn’t want to be with me any longer. He basically started saying the opposite of things he’s said our entire relationship and opposite of things he’d said even earlier that day and in that week. When I questioned that, he said “listen to what I’m saying now. Not what I said in the past.” I stated that the past couldn’t be counted from three hours earlier and he got angrier. 

He’s been giving me the silent treatment for the past 3 days when he’s explicitly talked about how stupid and childish that is (his ex used to do it to him all the time). He told my Dad I was stalking him (not true), and harassing his sister (not true). I responded to his sisters message to me saying that I was concerned about this erratic behavior and that he’s been feeling depressed. I told him that I’d give him some space and was here for him... whatever he needed... and said, “you’re my best friend. Just talk to me. You’re worrying me.”

He’s a generally grumpy (but lovable) person with a super short fuse and big reactions. Typically if he blows up, I let him process, and then he comes back to normal, apologizes, and tells me he’s thankful that I listen and let him vent it out. 

 Two days prior, he had come home from work hugging me and saying he was thinking and he knows he’s too hard on me, but that he loves me and likes me around. He also reiterated to me that he likes to mess with me and give me a hard time but to know I’m always in on the joke and not to worry. It’s something he’s said to me and our friends regularly. Even telling our friends that I take him seriously when he’s never being serious. 

We have short term plans, as well as long term plans to move out of the country in the works (his idea). My belongings are all still there, and I still have keys. He’s made it clear to my Dad that if I come near him or try to contact him that he’ll call the police and tell them that I’m stalking him. 

My Dad is also super concerned by his sudden and erratic behavior. My Dad said, “it’s like someone flipped a switch on his personality.” His sister hasn’t responded but did read my message. 

We’ve never gone more than a few hours between talking. He truly is my best friend. We talk about everything and check in multiple times a day. He had activities all weekend and uncharacteristically posted on Instagram 10 pictures in two days. He hates social media, recently erased his Facebook, and posts to Instagram MAYBE once a month. He started a new job today... not a word. I have a big second job interview tomorrow... not a word. 

What is going on? I’m concerned about his mental state. Help!

TL;DR

My Live-in BF (35M) and I (36F) have been together for 2 years. 

He texted me that he wanted me to “pack a bag, take the dogs, and leave” claiming he needed space. 

Then I received texts later that night saying “he’s not into me and wants to break up” out of the blue.

He’s been giving me the silent treatment for the past 3 days. He told my Dad I was stalking him (not true), and harassing his sister (not true). And said if I try to contact him that he’ll go to the police. 

What is going on? I’m concerned for his mental state."
64,"Boyfriend [34M] is being extremely insensitive about my [28F] loss.


Today is the anniversary of my mother passing away from cancer and it's a very difficult day for me every year. Several days ago, I told my boyfriend this day was approaching and he was sympathetic and supportive. When this day rolls around, I don't like to talk about it. I prefer to remain distracted and just try to focus on the present and not dwell on the past as that's how I work through the pain, but it still consumes my thoughts for much of the day and really brings me down.

My boyfriend and I have been together for 2.5 years. We've had our share of ups and downs, and our fights get pretty bad pretty quickly. I am always walking on eggshells around him as he can go from 0 - 100 in about 2 seconds flat. He has a very short fuse and lets his imagination get the best of him, getting mad at me for things he THINKS to be true (that aren't true) and not giving me the chance to explain my point of view.

Anyway, things have been less than ideal the past few months. We've had many arguments that have escalated very quickly, resulting in him mocking me, yelling in my face, throwing my belongings, etc. Tonight we got into another one of these arguments and he once again turned into a rage monster because of the conspiracy going on in his head. He often interrupts me and doesn't let me get a full thought out before dismissing me. He finally told me to ""start thinking and stop talking"" and told me he wasn't listening to anything else I had to say. I had plenty more to say (due to the constant interruptions) but bit my tongue in an attempt to not make things worse. I followed up with, ""Okay that's fine, but we need to continue this conversation later"" and he snapped at me for continuing to talk.

Tears began to pour from my eyes, immediately and without control or warning. He told me to turn off the waterworks, and I responded with, ""Please, don't. I have had a really rough day"". He replied, ""I'm not going to have sympathy for you"" and it was obvious to me that he had forgotten what today was. I had bottled my feelings up all day and suffered through everything on my own, and I guess this argument just pushed me over the edge.

This is where things got really shitty. I asked him if he forgot what today was and he replied saying I didn't tell him anything about today. I insisted that I did, and after a few seconds of him pondering, the light apparently went on in his head and he said (paraphrasing):

""I am sorry for your loss, but you didn't say anything to me about it all day, even on the phone when I asked you how your day was, and I told you all about my shitty day at work. You clearly don't trust me enough to talk to me about it. You bringing it up now to try and end an argument, get sympathy from me, and make me feel guilty is really tacky. How was it even a rough day?""

Me: ""It was rough because it's a constant reminder of the worst day of my life, it looms over me all day and really brings me down.""

Him: ""Oh great, you're being vague. What you're saying doesn't make any sense and is just a cop-out. Stop lying. I'm done with this conversation.""

My heart fucking sank into my chest when he said those things. I felt so incredibly hurt. I couldn't believe that he would infer that. I tried to explain to him that what he said was extremely hurtful and disrespectful; that he has no right to tell me how I should or should not be choosing to deal with such an emotional burden and that all I wanted in order to feel better was to be distracted from it, not confront it (a notion, at which, he scoffed); the fact that he was making it about HIM by acting all upset that I ""don't trust him enough to talk about it"" was selfish. Just the fact that my explanation for why the anniversary of my mother's death was not satisfactory to him really pissed me off. Why the FUCK should I even have to explain why that would sour my mood? And why the FUCK does he think he can dictate how I honestly answer his question, and then call bullshit on the whole thing? He just kept staring at his phone and saying, ""cool"" in response to everything I said, insisting that I was the one being disrespectful because earlier when we were on the phone, I was doing things (dishes, feeding the dogs, dealing with the kids) while he was telling me about his day. Even though I was able to recite the events of his day back to him, he was adamant that I was the selfish one and that I was just trying to flip it all around on him. He told me he refused to come to bed with me and he's sleeping on the couch now, like he always does after gaslighting me, leaving me alone to wallow in my anxiety.

Is this my breaking point? Finally? Or am I overreacting? I am now thoroughly confused. He has me feeling like I'm losing my mind, like my thoughts are going in circles and I can't recall fact from fiction at this point. Furthermore, I am completely crushed. I feel so hurt but at the same time, numb. Like I hate that he said those things about my mother but also, I'm not really surprised he did. And I hate that I'm not surprised.

TL;DR: Boyfriend and I got into another argument due to his anger issues, and he ended up insulting me for being upset on the anniversary of my mother's death, accusing me of using that as a means to make him feel guilty."
65,"I (22F) caught my boyfriend of a year (23M) stealing from me


My boyfriend Andrew and I have been dating for about a year and our relationship has been great, (until now), instant connection and we always talk about the future together. He is my best friend.

Andrew’s downfalls are that he has always had problems with money and is quite selfish with his money. I’ve always helped him out when he needs it since I’m good with money and don’t mind helping out the ones I love. He doesn’t have his life together right now but I’m patient, and believe he’ll get there.

The other day I caught Andrew going into my savings jar getting money out, (I store cash savings) I guess he didn’t hear me come back into the room. I questioned him and asked what he’s doing, and he said he was just looking for something. After a little prodding, he told me he was taking $50 because he needed it. I asked him if he’s done it other times as well, and he said there’s been a few other times he has taken money too. Jaw drop

I’m honestly SO heartbroken because I love this man so much and we spend a lot of time together and always talk about our future together. We were a perfect couple until this has happened. Now I’m unsure if I can trust him.
We don’t live together and I do a lot for him, (more than I probably should, hence him taking advantage) so it was a shock and I feel taken advantage of. 

Anyways, Andrew was extremely apologetic and said he needed gas money and that he thought I’d say no (when he knows I would have helped him out if he asked) and told me that if I broke up with him, he’d understand, but would never stop loving/trying for me.  I know he loves me SO much and I can see that and everyone can see that, but how can someone who loves me so much steal from me? Is there any way to come back from this or should I end it? What are the next steps? I don’t want to be blinded by love so I’m hoping others can make me look at this more rationally. 

TLDR; I caught my boyfriend stealing money from me and he’s confessed to doing it multiple times. I love him but is working through something like this worth it? Should I end it? What are the next steps?"
66,"My mom [f/50] won't let me [f/25] throw away my old writings. I think they're cringy and that they are mine to throw away. Mom disagrees.


As a child, I was spoiled and talked up constantly, so I thought I was a philosophical genius. Starting at age 6 I wrote a ton of ""deep"" poems and essays on people and how the world works. This continued until probably the age of 16. My mom has a million of these papers and I just hate them so much. 

They remind me of how clueless I was, and make me remember how my family was constantly lying to me about my ""brilliance"". My mom is actually still under this illusion and says she's going to publish a book of my poems and writings. I highly doubt anyone wants to read the #deep thoughts of an 11 year old who attends Christian private school. 

Now, I don't want to throw *everything* away, but we don't need to keep a 20 gallon container of this garbage. My mom thinks they belong to her, but I think they belong to me. There's even writings that I wrote to myself or dead relatives that were very private and personal. Things I didn't want her to read. Apparently these belong to her too. 

She will literally cry if I talk about throwing them away. But it gives me so much freaking anxiety when I see my private diary entries proudly displayed on the coffee table. She's kind of a narcissist, so she doesn't understand that she may need to compromise for my happiness. It doesn't compute for her. Her happy = everyone happy. 

Also, I would not feel so adamant if she didn't also share them with everyone (and the world, going by her future plans). It obvious to me that she loves me and is proud of me, and I deeply appreciate it, but this makes me *so* uncomfortable. 

**Tl;dr: I want to throw away my old, cringy, horrible, sometimes-private writings, but my mom says they belong to her and I cannot touch them.**"
67,"UPDATE: Told my (25F) uncle (56M) who told my (52M) dad that I wasn’t moving back, now my dad abandoned my family and left the mess for me to clean up.


Okay so please refer to my [previous post](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/cuian6/immigrant_parents_always_trying_to_exact_control/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app) for some background on this. I (25F) am currently so torn up and wrecked. This situation has escalated to the point where I ACTUALLY don’t know what to do. So on Friday, I posted about my qualms with moving back, and how my family is abusive, etc. I had to go to a wedding this past weekend and I wasn’t going to go with my family, but my uncle. I filled my uncle in on the situation, and he asked me what my plan was. I told him I was not going to move back because it was too much for me and that I needed to keep my distance. He said okay, and we went to the wedding. It was enjoyable because we (me, my uncle, his family, and my parents and brother) were in a public setting surrounded by friends. Anyway, I was acting like nothing was wrong because I didn’t want to signal to my family friends that me and my parents were having problems, so I continued talking to my friends. Anyway, a couple of hours into the event, my dad comes up to me and says, “you are a shit daughter. Your uncle just told me you are not moving back. Leave. We don’t want to be seen with you.” And I couldn’t control my emotions because I was upset, I was crying and just wanted to leave. I ran to the bathroom and he followed, and so did my mom and my brother. My mom started yelling at my dad that a wedding was not the time and place to discuss this, and my brother (23M), was telling my dad that he was wrong in the situation and that he should have waited. In my opinion, it was wrong of my uncle to disclose that information at that time, and he should have waited for me to speak to them. My dad walked out of the wedding and left with my uncle, my mom sat there and cried in the bathroom as did I, and my brother just walked out and sat on the benches. So many people came up and asked if everything was okay, leave it to my family to ruin someone else’s event. My mom passed it off as “our cat ran away.” ... yeah okay. Anyway we (my mom, my brother, and I) drove home (to my parents house) together. My dad comes downstairs and starts to yell at me profusely and calls my uncle to use him as an alibi for what was said, as it turned out, my uncle didn’t tell him anything, only that my dad should leave me alone and I’ll talk to him myself. He just made that statement to get a rise out of me at a public event. And I started to get hysterical, I yelled, I cursed him out, and I told him he was the reason I wasn’t living at home. He instead, got up and pointed the finger at my mom, told her she was the reason why his kids disrespect him and that she was a terrible wife and a dishonorable woman, and basically slandered her on the group chat with her side of the family. She, on the other hand has never spoken out to anyone about what happens between them... so. Yeah. While I was screaming, I fell over because I couldn’t breathe and my chest was in pain, my brother picked me up and carried me to my room, gave me water and told me to calm down— it was an anxiety attack— a severe one. And I cried myself to sleep. In the morning I went to my mom’s room only to find her crying because my dad packed all his stuff in the middle of the night and left. Apparently to Pakistan— for good. I couldn’t handle the situation, so I went back to my apartment. Later on my brother calls me crying, saying dad signed the mortgage over to my mom, and that he put all the credit card information in her name, and all the bills and utilities. And they don’t know how to pay the bills. Because they can’t afford the massive house without my dads paycheck, or pay the bills, or the car payments, or anything. And that it’s all my fault, and if I moved home for good, it would all be fixed. But at what cost? I’m so broken, I haven’t told my boyfriend any of this and I’m pretending that everything is fine, because I don’t know if he can handle it. My brother doesn’t know I have two new roommates moving in and we signed the lease already and if I left I would still have to pay the rent Bc we aren’t allowed to sublet. And they were only allowed to move out because it’s with me.... So now I’m:

1. Feeling severely stressed.
2. Feeling physically ill.
3. Hiding this mess from my boyfriend, who I am seeing at his parents place this weekend. 
4. Omitting information from my brother and mother
5. Feel like my dad is using this as a ruse to get me home to exact control over my life
6. I feel financially obligated to support if this IS real, but don’t have the funds readily available to support two whole humans other than myself outside of paying my own rent and bills. 

*TL;DR*

My dad abandoned my family after a fight at a wedding and I feel like it’s a ruse to get me back home. But my mom and brother aren’t actors and they are immensely upset and scared because they can’t support themselves to keep the house because they don’t have the financial means. They say I’m the only way this issue is going to resolve itself. I just need help. I can’t believe this is happening, and I just want to hide myself. oh and I didn’t tell my BF anything about this situation— Bc I don’t want him to get stressed."
68,"My (27f) boyfriend (33m) says he doesn’t have to answer to anybody, not even me


We have been together over a year with a small break in the middle. 

Basically, he told me last night that he doesn’t have to answer to anyone when I asked him why he was messaging a certain girl on Instagram. I then proceeded to ask him what he expects out of a serious relationship ship/marriage (we’ve talked about it), because now that makes me uneasy. 

How would you react to this, and is he right? I’ve always been in very open and honest relationships, and have never had this said to me and vice versa.

69,"My(28m) wife(25F) says I'm too ambitious and it makes her insecure when I brought up that I got a new job offer.


My wife and I argued about a job offer thats on the table. I work at a small town casino and she works part time as a food stocker at a local grocery market. I make about 50k a year and she makes 20k. The argument happened when I told my wife that I was offered a job by my old colleague that would pay more and have better benefits. She got mad saying that I was too ambitious and that I made her insecure. Confused, I asked her what she meant. She said that she was tired me constantly looking for better opportunities/job/promotions and that she wanted me to just stay in one place and settle. I was just baffled because everything I do is for us. Over the past 2 years I've had 4 jobs, each one increasing higher pay/benefits with this next one giving me a 15k bump and even better benefits. Any advice?

TL;DR: Wife is upset, saying that I am overly ambitious, making her feel insecure. I Just got a new job offer and the wife doesn't want me to take it."
70,"[F30] I asked my husband [M35] to clean our bed off, and four months later I did it for him. I'm tired of being his mother. Married five years.


This probably not as drastic as some issues here, so thank you for your time. 

My husband just finished up grad school this last spring. He burned out really hard towards the end, because he took on a side job that was way more work than he anticipated. Whatever. I was doing as much as I could to help around the house, etc. School ended, and so did his side gig, which was seasonal. I expected he'd spend a few weeks enjoying the lack of work, but I thought eventually he'd step it up at home. 

Our bedroom got really messy, and instead of sleeping in bed together, we started sleeping on the couch. This is something we used to do on our pull-out, but we agreed it was a bad habit and that we wouldn't do it any longer once we got a new couch... But we did anyways. This has consisted of me curling up on the lounge while he stretches out. I was going through a hard time at work, and a hard time with family, and just didn't have the time/energy to deal with the mess in our bedroom (as I always had before). I began to see the bed as a symbol for our marriage, how I basically have to do everything or it doesn't get done. I told my husband this, and he flinched, but didn't clean off the bed. A couple of months ago, I was leaving for a trip, and noticed the dog had thrown up on the bed, and told my husband, expecting him to clean it while I was gone. He didn't. I came back a week later, and the dog barf was still there. 

I outright expressed to my husband that I felt I would have to clean it all or nothing would happen. He made a half-assed effort to clean off the bed, did a load of laundry or two, and gave up. He told me it hurt him to hear how it represented our marriage and that I didn't seem to want to put in the effort any more to set things right. The fact I've spent five years doing all the cleaning is lost on him.

The other day, I snapped and just cleaned everything up because I can't take it any more. It took me hardly any time at all to clean off the bed and change the sheets and clean the mattress--I knew it wouldn't take long, but I just wanted to see if he'd ever do it. Now I have my answer. 

I feel like I did everything I could to tell my husband that I feel this is an example of how I have to be his mother, how nothing happens in our relationship unless I do it, and yet he still was fine letting it sit for four months, despite everything. 

I can't help but feel incredibly resentful about this now. I don't think it's crazy to ask my unemployed husband with a ton of free time at home to do some simple chores around the house, and yet he couldn't do this one thing even though sleeping more restfully in our bedroom is beneficial for our individual health and our sex life. 

**TLDR: I tried to wait out my husband on one simple chore--cleaning the bed. Despite asking many times and talking about it extensively, it didn't happen. Four months later I gave up and did it myself... Like I knew I would have to. I'm tired of the inequality of our relationship and don't even know how to address it any more.**"
71,"Wife cheated. Creepy other person and police involved. Now in limbo, any advice?


3 years ago I discovered my wife was having an affair. It was with a coworker and had been going on for 10 months. The other person was intent on splitting us up so he could have my wife for himself. 

This included doing some pretty creepy things. He started running past our house. He regularly turned up at places we went to as a family. He hand delivered individual Christmas cards to me for my wife and 2 children with a perfume stick of his scent in my wife's card. He sent me anonymous letters saying he was sleeping with my wife. My wife invited him out on my birthday and he was all over her in front of me and my family &amp; friends. He orchestrated a meet up with me just to try and plant seeds of doubt in my mind without ever admitting to anything.

I know how stupid it seems now but even with all this I couldn't believe my wife would do that, I trusted her completely. 

I later found out my step father worked out what was happening and told the other person to leave his family alone. A lot went on with the other person trying to manipulate things, police were involved with him trying to get people in trouble. It ended with my mum and brother both finding out about my wife but my wife convinced them all to keep it a secret from me for the sake of our family.

Finally when he could see that non of his games were shaking my trust he posted me a print out of all their sordid WhatsApp messages. I called the police and he was cautioned for harassment. I was naturally devastated but I stayed with my wife to try and work through it for the sake of my family and 2 young children (2&amp;5).

The end started when my wife &amp; I were out on separate nights. I went to the bar she was in and saw her chatting with a man at the bar and accepting a drink from him. He then followed her and tried flirting with her in front of me. I lost my temper and took us home. It was perhaps a fairly small thing but it is not the actions a repentant cheater should be demonstrating.

I moved out 3 months ago. I was carrying too much anger and resentment with no sign of it getting better. However I now feel so sad and cry a lot. 

Part of what makes this tough is I have only slept with my wife having met young. It feels like I gave myself to her completely and she has abused that. I now have a real desire to experience being with someone else. However I cant bring myself to date as feel I'm cheating and it is the final nail in our marriage. I guess I'm still clinging on to what we had. To be honest I get on really well with my wife even now and our time as a family is great. I keep wondering if I should go back. I can then be with my kids every day and financially we are so much better off and can give them the best life. But I have to deal with this anger and resentment at what my wife has done and reside with the fact I wont experience sex with someone else. I'm stuck in a limbo with no idea where to turn. 

Any advice?

Tl;dr wife cheated on me. Other person was manipulative and cautioned by police. Now stuck in limbo unable to let go of marriage but too resentful to return home."
72,"I (22M) took in my cousin (16F).


I have taken in my cousin, after she was kicked out of her parent's house. She came out to them and they did not take that very well.

We weren't very close to each other, but we were never mean or anything. We only really saw each other a few times a year at family gatherings and such. We would joke around and have fun when we were around each other, but we had other family closer to our own age and everything, so we didn't hang out too much.

So it was strange to get a call from her earlier this week. Like I said earlier, she came out to her parents and they kicked her out. She asked if she could stay with me. Immediately, I said it was fine and if she needed a ride to my house.

I was not her first call, I was just the only one to agree. Apparently, everyone else in my extended family of aunts, uncles, and cousins have all taken the 'not our business' approach to the situation.

Selfishly, I love that she's here. It's been boring since I broke up with my girlfriend recently. It's nice having another person to talk to and watch tv with besides my dog.

She wasn't allowed to grab any of her belongings, so I've had to take her shopping for new clothes, new make-up, and really anything else she may need.

She's been sad and depressed since coming to stay with me. I understand why, and I can somewhat understand not being wanted by a parent. But this is way out my depth.

Also, her parents have caught wind that I am housing her and are extrememly displeased with me. They have said told me that I am supposed to either kick her out, or finalize the process and essentially adopt her.

I don't know what to do here. How can I help her feel better? How do I break it to her that her parents fully don't want her anymore? What if she doesn't want me to become her guardian?

Literally, any advice on the situation will help.

TL;DR: I have a lesbian cousin that is a minor living with me and I don't know what to do to help her."
73,"Need advice on dealing with daughter's infidelity


 TL;DR: Daughter cheated on her husband, hasn't confessed, and I'm not sure what to do

I recently learned that my daughter (37) cheated on her husband (40) of 15 years (together 18). She cheated with a guy they both know and hang out with and that is still regularly in their lives (although she is adamant that the affair is over and their was never an emotional component). Whatever her reasons, cheating was an illegitimate response and it sickens me that she has done this. They have 4 kids  (ages 4 -17).

My son-in-law  doesn't have a clue and I'm fairly certain he would explode if he found  out. He might try to hurt the guy or himself. My daughter is remorseful, but apparently not enough to stop it from happening a ""couple of times"" or to confess. She seems to be unsure whether  she wants to try and fix her marriage or divorce.

She's my daughter and although I hate what she's done, I have to help her figure out what to do now. I've told her in the past to get into IC and MC, but she hasn't done it. Even if she starts today, the damage is done. At this point, she seems to want to just rugsweep her infidelity it and hope that her husband never finds out. However, she has already told her married best friend about it (who seems to have ghosted her) and her best friend probably told her own husband (who is also good friend of my son-in-law). It seems just a matter of time before my son-in-law finds out.

I need to talk to my daughter, but I'm not sure about the best advice to give. The right thing to do would be to tell her to confess (in public, with a bag already packed) and accept the consequences. But the chances are that she won't do that. At least not now. Meanwhile, I have to pretend that everything is normal with my son-in-law. I can't say how I'll react if  her affair partner comes around when I'm at their house, but there's no way I'll be able to fake my disdain for him and what he's knowingly done to their marriage. What should I do?"
