0,"UPDATE: Apparently, I'm(26F) too perfect for someone like him(28M). Was this the best shutdown ever or is he really that insecure?


[original](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/cysbos/apparently_im26f_too_perfect_for_someone_like/)

I wasn't going to bother linking the original post but I guess I have to. It only attracted the attention of 2 people, one of them probably has a lot of throaways judging by my karma. Still, it's a happy ending and a teachable moment I would love to share with the world.

&amp;#x200B;

In a nutshell- I met a guy I liked, found out there was an incident involving him, ran away cause I lost a close friend to a similar situation and that was too much for me to handle. A year or so later I looked him up to see if he even survived, we got back in touch and became friends. Over the years I caught feelings, he started yet another relationship. He went through a hard time and crashed at my place. We kept living together, he got better emotionally and started showering me with affection. Then I got hit by a drunk diver and got off with no complication and very easy recovery (compared to what could've been in that particular situation). While I was in the hospital he told me the incident left him disfigured. He fixed that, it's barely noticeable, you literally have to know about the remaining scar to see it but he can't stop seeing himself that way. Once I left the hospital, those tiny signs of affection got progressively bigger, to the point there wasn't a moment without physical contact. One night we were cuddled up on the couch and I went for the kiss, he shut me down by saying I'm too perfect to be wasted on someone like him.

&amp;#x200B;

The actual update- The next day I went to work, he pretended last night never happened, I was freaking out cause I wanted to have the talk but didn't want to push it. Had the talk anyway and now we're together. We opened up about a lot of things. He had no idea why I ran away when I found out about the incident. He thought I knew about his injuries and didn't want him like that. I haven't spoken about my friend with anyone but a therapist, I finally told him and he understood. He said he was jumping from relationship to relationship to numb his feeling for me cause he thought I would never be able to love him back. The night I tried to make the move, it was the kiss itself that freaked him out. Turns out that sexy cheeky slightly crooked smile is nerve damage and an ex told him he's the worst kisser in the world. He's not. He's also brilliant in bed. In that one night we became closer than in the past 7 years. And I told him acting like my housewife/babysitter won't fly no more and he toned it down but he still pampers me to an extent. Right now we're like teenagers, glued at the lips, making up for lost time. He was my best friend for so long and I know he's the one for me. This felt like a relationship for months before it even started, now I got the good stuff on top of the perfect partnership we already had. So people, talk to your loved ones ffs! We wasted years beating around the bush, learn from our mistakes.

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR- Communication is vital. Don't be like us, talk to the people you love, no matter how hard it is. Yes, he was that insecure. We're together now and we're making up for lost time. We will work on our issues together."
1,"(UPDATE) I (25/f) ended up telling my friend (28/m) I liked him and it blew up in my face


Original- https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/d0ubyd/i_25f_ended_up_telling_my_friend_28m_i_liked_him/

I ended up texting him yesterday that I was sorry if I wasn't more clear in my message, I didn't want to confuse him. I wrote ""I apologize if I wasn't clear. I do have significant feelings for you and I believe if the circumstances were right, we could work and I'm willing to try that"". He responded: ""Oh, sorry I read it but then forgot I asked you and you texted me lol"".

I waited a few hours to see if he would elaborate. He didn't, so I texted him how he felt about what I said. He said he never felt anything for me more than an acquaintance (HIS WORD), and couldn't believe I had the audacity to tell him my feelings, when ""I KNEW he never felt that way"". I didn't actually know this. He said he never made it seem like he liked me, never would. I felt like tone was really harsh so I called him. He was just as rude. I told him I think it's best we go our separate ways and don't remain ""acquaintances"". This pissed him off for some reason, he hangs up. He then texts that he wanted there to be an open door to chat as acquaintances in the future. I don't understand why. WHY?

That's all folks. I wish I was joking.

**TL;DR** Not interested in me"
2,"I (25/f) ended up telling my friend (28/m) I liked him and it blew up in my face


We've been friends since high school, almost 10 years. We don't see each other that often since he moved about 2 hours driving distance away but still see each other a few times a year. We always had a flirtatious friendship and joked around all the time. It never seemed too serious. Last year, I started to develop feelings for him, nothing major or worth telling in my opinion. Until yesterday. We were texting about how the dating scene is for people our age, he knows I hate dating, and he's been having some rough dates. He recently got back from a bad one. I told him that those women are clearly stupid, that he would be a great guy to date. He ended up flat out asking me if I had feelings for him. I said yes, I didn't want to lie, but it was just a crush, and wouldn't affect our friendship. He asked me if I was being honest, and reiterated that he knows I don't like dating. I said yes I was being honest and I am sorry it came out like this, that he knows I don't lie. 

He never responded. He's very active on social media though. I feel sick to my stomach about it. I can't sleep or eat. I want to throw my phone in a river and run away. I don't know what to do. He knows I have social anxiety and not responding is a huge slap in the face. What should I do? Did I completely mess this up?

\*\*TL;DR\*\* I told my friend I liked him and now it's ruined. Can anything be salvaged?"
3,"My (20F) BIL (30M) is an asshole and yesterday was the last straw


For context: My sister (27F) is now pregnant with their 2nd child. Me and sis started really getting to know each other 4 years ago. Prior to that we didn’t really have any meaningful connection because of the age gap and other family issues. Her and BIL met and have been a couple for 5-6 years now, so he’s always been around. 

He’s basically “the clown type” as I may say. He makes fun of everyone that’s not on his “superior  level” (even of my sis, calling her names when I’m around- she says she doesn’t mind). He also constantly makes fun of our father (because he’s very conservative) and jokes about him every time he gets the chance to.

I’m really busy with school, but on a good month I’d probably hang out with them (at their place mostly) once a week. Me and my sis are getting along just great, have a lot to talk about and I love her a lot. 

Ever since I met BIL he started making fun of me in a way that made me really sad, like “why are you so shy/ skinny/ sad? Nobody will ever like you. You have no friends because of x thing.” In a somewhat jokingly manner so that if I ever said he was being mean, he would say “oh, I’m only joking, don’t be so sensitive”.

For a couple months now he started making fun of my appearance- “you have Dumbo ears”, “your nose is like a skiing slope”, “you’re as fat as a cow” (I gained a little weight but nothing serious). I think I’m fairly good looking but his words really bring me down and I start questioning it. He also started pulling pranks on me- he painted my face pink when I was about to head to a party with my other sister, and because he is much heavier then me I couldn’t get away and had to redo all of my makeup.

Yesterday, I was hanging out with my other sister (18F) at their place. My BIL’s wife was at work and he came home to grab something. He enters the house and says “your belly looks like Jabba the Hutt when you laugh, you’re so fat OMG”. I didn’t say much thing back and just started packing my bag to head out. When I’m about to put on my shoes I notice he has written my dad’s name all over them in red marker. 

For the first time ever, I got really mad and yelled at him. I told him that it is too much and very mean of him. So he started rubbing my shoes with alcohol and the writing is gone, but they’re still red from the marker and look like shit. I just grab them and tell him “I never want to see you again, I hate you” and left.

When his wife found out, she texted me that she’s sorry for what he did- but I just didn’t reply. I’m so mad about it all. I still want to be around my sister (especially since she is pregnant and their other son always asks to see me +I love them so much). 

TL;DR: my BIL makes fun of me and has pulled a really bad “prank” on me. I still want to see my sister, but not him."
4,"My [28] girlfriend [26] is incredibly socially awkward and eccentric. I love her but her personality is really offputting to a lot of people. I need advice on how to help her.


She's a nice person and obviously as her boyfriend i don't want to hurt her feelings. We've been together for 7 years. When we first met she was very shy and anxious about socializing. I encouraged her to be confident and put herself out there to make friends. She has but in the 7 years I've known her she hasn't actually developed any social skills and doesn't pick up on hints at all. She's made friends with 2 or 3 people who love her for who she is and they really click. 
But there have been a lot of situations where the other person tries to distance themselves and she keeps trying to communicate until they lose their patience and bluntly tell her off.

My girlfriend is no longer allowed in a store because she kept trying to force a friendship with a particular girl there. We went there often because we love the comics, books and figurines. This employee started walking to hide in the back of the store when she saw us coming. My girlfriend would chase her down and try talking to her and would still text her number. One day she made friends with someone else working there and while they were texting the other persons tone got cold and they confronted her about ""stalking"" the first girl. I decided we should stay away for a while.

There have been a lot of other situations like this but not quite as dramatic as this one. I feel somewhat responsible because i was the one to encourage her to stop being afraid to make friends. I told her everything would be okay but it wasn't. A lot of people see her as dumb and annoying. Even my own family thought that and disliked her for the longest time. Of course they have gotten to know her better and accept her for who she is now. 

It's really hard for me to describe her. She's a bit quirky, open and energetic. She's also really naive and immature for her age. She can't read people or situations. She goes on the assumption that everyone already likes her and are her friends. Sometimes people look at us and wonder what my motives are with her. Like they think I'm looking to take advantage of her because of her maturity level. 

I get angry when people react badly to her but at the same time i can see how she can be too much for some people. We're both geeks so she is usually accepted in that scene. How can i help her develop proper social skills?

Tl;dr girlfriend of 7 years has a hard time keeping friends because of her lack of social skills"
5,"Overheard my [27F] fiance [28M] speaking to his best friend [28F]


I don't think what I heard was objectively bad, but it absolutely crushed me and I'm not entirely sure why I feel this way or what to do about it. Our wedding date is in early November, we have been engaged for almost a year and dating for the past three. I feel utterly heartbroken and am not sure if we should keep the engagement on. Everything has been great besides this.

In the past I have definitely felt like I was competing with my fiance's best friend, whom he met on his first day of college, not necessarily romantically but just his attention overall even though we have become fairly good friends. I know that she is objectively prettier than I am (we have fairly artistic and entrepreneurial friends, and she is the default for any promotional photos or modeling gigs) and she is the definition of a ""cool"" girl. She's super fit, into rock climbing and backpacking (same as my fiance), has an amazing career (unfortunately in the same field as my fiance as well), and has always been nothing but kind and gracious towards me. As far as I know, her and my fiance have always been 100% platonic friends and they do certain activities together that I'm not that into. I completely trust my fiance and am fine with this, though sometimes I wish he would be more enthusiastic about a Sunday afternoon spent indoors with me rather than out in the sun with his friend. Anyways, to the point, we had a large gathering of old friends recently and we rented a large AirBnB and all for Labor Day. Our last evening there, at some point my fiance broke away from the group with his friend, and after a bit I trailed after them (mayyybe out of jealousy, but I think I just wanted to join their conversation). Anyways, they didn't hear me approaching and I heard my fiance gushing to his best friend about how much he loved me and how amazing it was that it felt like home when he was with me. Okay, cool. Gave me the warm and fuzzies and I, being stupid, decided to stay hidden and keep listening. Then, he said he was really glad that she urged him to stay with me when we first started dating - not word for word but he pretty much said that he found me boring and not entirely attractive, and thanked her for being there for the difficult bits (I didn't even know there were difficult bits???). He also said he knows now that him and his friend are definitely incompatible, which among other things, implied that he had tried to go for her, but got shot down consistently and ended up settling for me. His best friend responded brushing off the thanks and just said that he was lucky to have someone like me in his life and to thank me for putting up with him instead. I headed back to the group after this. I don't think his friend did anything wrong and I appreciate her sticking up for me. And even though my fiance ""came around"" in the end according to him, I am devastated by everything else he said. Am I overreacting? It feels like I am since our relationship has been healthy and strong and he is very respectful towards me, but I just feel like I am having a very tough time getting over the fact that it seems like he settled for me only because his best friend wasn't available. And even now, I kind of get the sense that if she were available, he would absolutely go for her instead. Everything is booked for the wedding and all deposits have been paid so I am not sure what to do.

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR: Fiance told his best friend that he was very in love with me, and thanked her for advising him to stay with me when he wanted to break up with me, which I didn't even know about. Still get the sense that he would easily date her over me if given the chance."
6,"My (33) physically and mentally capable mother (62) has stopped adulting


My mom was the primary care taker for my brother and I for our childhoods and was a wonderful mom. She was loving and patient and is still my biggest cheerleader. She cooked, drove us to practices, and played with us and we knew her as adventurous and capable. This is a woman who traveled Europe solo in her early 20s and lived a full adult life for many years. She's educated and kind and had always been someone that I aspired to be like. Of course she had her faults as well, but they were things my parents tried to keep private. My mom was always bad with money but it would always be my dad to get the second job to pay things off if she spent too much. She didn't like cooking, so he would do most of it but she made up for it by doing the housework and the dishes. They tried to make things fair and equal.

Since I moved out my mom has steadily been giving up basic tasks for taking care of herself until now where she is almost completely reliant on other people to provide for her. She doesn't cook, clean, drive, and it's a miracle she has a job. I think it's more of a charity than anything. They had her working as a librarian but she 'can't' use the computer so they moved her into being a 'greeter'. She gets free meals with work and on the days she's off she gets sandwiches or take away because she 'can't cook'. She gave up her car when she moved to the city and now says she 'can't drive'. She also has a tiny dorm-style apartment that she doesn't need to clean. 

When I was pregnant she came to stay and 'help' but I ended up making three meals a day, cleaning, and later doing diaper changes all while I was supposed to be on bedrest. She was more work than the baby and when we would try to make things easier by doing things like ordering pizza she still would ask how to heat up the leftovers and I'd have to get up and show her how the oven worked every single time. She 'couldn't' turn on the stove to make her own coffee in the mornings and I had to show her every morning for a month. I would ask her to help by running a load of laundry but she could never remember how it worked no matter how many times I showed her. Her 89 year old mother drives her around when she comes to visit. 

There is absolutely nothing that makes her incapable of doing tasks that she did daily for over 50 years before other than a desire to have someone else do them for her because that's easier than doing it yourself. I've thought about dementia or depression but she seem to have any confusion or fogginess and she doesn't seem depressed. She's always motivated to do things like meet up with friends and is impeccable with taking care of her appearance. I've had a conversation with her about the fact that her not wanting to do something is not the inability to do something. It's selfish to say you 'can't' do something just because you don't want to do it. It doesn't mean that it doesn't get done, just that she's making someone else do the work. 

I don't know what to do because she hasn't saved anything for retirement and I think that the church thinks they're helping someone who is truly in need by giving her an easy charity job and providing all her needs when in reality I think they're enabling her 'meh, someone else will do it for me' attitude. She's not so subtly dropped hints that she wants to come live with me and 'take care' of the kids but I know that it would be a nightmare trying to raise two young kids and my mom. She has a total lack of awareness of how much work she is and thinks that apologizing for not helping is equal to helping. She has made no plans for what to do when she actually is incapable of taking care of herself and I would feel to guilty to put her in a home or leave her on the streets. I've tried talking to her and she took it as a ""You should try to push yourself out of your comfort zone."" and not ""Stop making other people do everything for you."" I've also tried just refusing to help. In the last week of her stay I stopped making her coffee and told her if she wanted it badly enough she'd figure out how to work the stove; she didn't.  

My husband tries really hard when she's here but she lies often and just creates stress on relationships. I get tired from having to do so much and he gets tired to come home after a long day of working and have to deal with her. She'll do things like leave the door open when she comes home, then lie and say it wasn't her so she 'doesn't get in trouble'. She has also lied about leaving choking hazards around the house that I found the toddler with. She lies in the same way a kid lies because she doesn't want us to get mad at her instead of just admitting blame and not doing it again. He had a really hard time having her here for a month; I can't imagine him being able to stomach having her here long term. 

Does anyone have any advice or has anyone dealt with a situation similar to this that might be able to provide some insight? 

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR My mom has stopped taking care of herself and has no plan for the future. I'm worried I'll have to take care of her and am afraid of the stress it'll put on my life."
7,"I (32f) am pregnant and found my husband (28m) reactivated his tinder


Reddit please help, I never thought I’d be posting on here as my life was seemingly perfect and at the moment I don’t feel like I can talk to friends or family about this. This is a throwaway because my main is obviously me.

I’m going to try and type things out as impartial as I can.

I am currently pregnant (13 weeks) and have been suffering terribly with Hyperemesis, I’m on a bunch of anti sickness meds, I’m off work, I’ve been in bed throwing up for the last 7 weeks and have had countless hospital trips, a few days ago my husband even said to me he doesn’t understand how people cheat on their pregnant partners.

I have been so ill, this weekend some of his old friends arranged a meet up and initially he had cancelled to look after me. I convinced him to go and told him the last 2 months had been difficult and he needed to relax.

He went yesterday afternoon, texted me throughout the evening and came home today around 12pm.

A few hours ago a random friend messaged me saying she had seen his profile on tinder but it was clearly a fake, his name was changed and it said he was straight, Demi sexual and questioning. Initially I thought it was his crazy ex. Then I realised photos were ones he had taken and not uploaded to Facebook, he doesn’t really use social media and his location was where he was last night so I knew something wasn’t right. 

I questioned him and he initially said he didn’t know what I was on about and then I told him to stop lying. He said that he opened up an old account and updated the photos late last night when he got back to the hotel, he shared a room with 4 other guys so I don’t think for a second he physically cheated on me, I made him redownload it in front of me -

There wasn’t a paid subscription
There we absolutely no messages on there

I don’t know what to do, I have been so ill and so down these last few months with Hyperemesis in my pregnancy and he has been the doting husband. I have never ever for a second thought he would cheat on me and we spend every second of our day together, so I don’t think he has ever cheated before.

I want to walk away. I want to terminate the pregnancy and not look back in 10 years time when I’m tied to a kid I have to coparent and wish I’d seen the signs sooner.

He said he did it because he just wanted to see if anyone liked him back because he’s been feeling low, we haven’t had sex for 8 weeks because I’ve been so ill. Not that this is an excuse, at all. He said it was a stupid mistake, he won’t ever do it again and he wants to go for counselling and work things out.

Reddit I am so, so lost right now. I can’t believe that this is happening to me, we were the couple everyone was envious of because we were so ‘perfect’ and he’s done this. We always read relationships together and discuss how sad it is that people cheat. 

Do I walk away or do I try? I don’t know what to do. I know he hasn’t physically cheated but I feel so lied to, I feel like it’s only been 8 weeks of me being ill and he couldn’t stick it out and he chose this over me and his unborn child.

TLDR: I am pregnant and found out husband has reactivated a tinder account for ‘gratification’"
8,"I (28F) just found out my BF (35M) is married. Should I tell his wife?


Long story short, the guy I’ve been seeing for about a year is married. I apparently missed some big red flags along the way and I’m pretty heartbroken. We’ve gone on trips together, he’s met my family, we have talked about the future. I thought we loved each other

I’m pretty angry so I thought I should ask someone other than my obviously biased friends:

Should I tell his wife (who I found on FB) that she’s married to a scumbag? Or is that just my anger and need to burn it all down showing?

He (for obvious reasons) is begging me not to tell her but I think I’d want to know. 

TL;DR: Should I tell his wife he’s a cheater?"
9,"My (45M) ex-wife (45F)'s (almost ex) husband (65M) is desperately trying to get in touch with me


Thank you for reading, I am using a throwaway.

&amp;#x200B;

When I was 25 I got married to a girl I met in college, let's call her Ann. I thought Ann was the  love of my life and she seemed to think the same so after 2 years of dating, we got married and a month later she was pregnant. Our twin boys were born 9 months later. A life full of bliss, right?

Wrong. 1 month after giving birth, a new manager was hired at the company she worked at and she immediately started an affair with him, despite him being married. 6 months later I was divorced, poor and I had to fight for custody of my twins. My ex's new bf, let's name him John, also wanted our kids to call him dad. So for the next few  years life was not fun to try to co-parent with these two.

They got married 2 years later and never had children. Everytime I would see John, he would pretend to be better than me, cause he was richer, 'smarter', etc. Ann ofcourse loved it. 

When my boys were 12, and legally allowed to choose who they wanted to live with, they chose me and my wife. Soon afterward, John and Ann broke up a first time but got back together.

Cue to now, Ann has filed for divorce 12 months ago cause she was cheating on John with a co-worker.  She has moved in with said co-worker. 

Ever since, John, has tried to reach out to me. First through the kids, by asking them my number, which they did not give. And now by social media. He feels that we are 'in the same boat', and wants to talk about it. I have tried blocking him, but he continues to create new accounts, this morning, I received a mail from him.

How do I get rid of him, or is it wise to speak to him?

Tl;dr: My (45M) ex-wife (45F)'s  (almost ex) husband (65M) is desperately trying to get in touch with me, what to do?"
10,"My husband (38M) thinks because I (30F) work from home that I can do a lot of things around the house during work hours


 Hi  reddit. I am a 30F who works from home. I work for a big health  insurance company as a subject matter expert, so its not some part time  job I can work whenever I want. I have meetings to attend, meetings I  have to run, and plenty of work to do throughout the day. I also get  messaged frequently with questions or for loading someone with  inventory. Plenty of times it's my supervisor messaging with questions  so I can't just be away from my computer for long lengths of time.

The  issue is, my husband, 38M, thinks because I work from home that I can  do whatever I want whenever I want. So often he will ask me to do a few  things throughout the day. Depending on the task, it could be something  quick and simple that I can do - I definitely have the freedom to walk  away and do something quick for 5minutes like load laundry into the  washer. Some days are slower than others so some days I may be able to  get more done around the house than others. I also have set things I use  my lunch and breaks for like doing dishes, cleaning litter boxes,  vacuuming.

But there are plenty of  times he asks me to do something I just cant get done during my working  hours, and gets mad when he comes home and finds it not done. He doesnt  work from home and completely does not understand that I can't go  outside for 15 minutes at a time to drain our little pool, to water new  grass 4x a day, to help him with a project when hes off from work and  I'm not.

I dont know that I am  looking for advice, more venting I guess. I don't know how to get it  through to him that just because I can walk away for 5 minutes to get  coffee or just take a quick break here and there, that it doesn't mean I  can walk away for 15, 20, 25 minutes at a time and get all kinds of  things done around the house.

tl;dr My husband thinks I have all the time in the world to get stuff done around the house during working hours because I work from home"
11,"[17 Female], My dad was about to beat up my mom, so I called the cops on him secretly, even though they had calmed down.


My dad was about to beat up my mom, throwing a few hits, it felt very very wrong to me so I (17F) scretly called the cops on him. He had done a few hits and my mom did scream a lot, and she went to a different side of the house. They did scream at eachother for a bit and she said she was going to stay at grandmas for the night, and I thought this would ahppen, but by the time this happened the cops had come.   


My mom and dad were both interviewed and they did realise she had facial marks, which my mom lied about and said nothing happened. They did not or my dad when they said nothing happpened, and they took in in for the night to keep my mom safe.  


1) Should I feel guilty over this, I knew my mom was probably safe at the end as they did calm down, but there was a chance of a futher beating (unlikley)?  


2)Is it likley that my parents think a neighbour called, as I think my dad will beat the crap out of me if he finds out, do neighbours call the cops on these things?  


3) Will this be a wake up call for my dad, do people realise something is wrong once they get ""a night in a cell"" and try to change themselves?  


TLDR : Dad beat mom, I called the cops, but they calmed down, should I feel bad?"
12,"I (F/28) am not sure what to do about creepy housemate (M/27)


Hi Reddit,

I live in a share house with 4 other people, I’ve been living here now for 3 years.
 
One of the housemates let’s call him David has always tried to make cringeworthy jokes to me and thinks he’s really funny. He always thinks he’s right and said little insults to me I.e why do you buy this brand of food, it’s so bad and always asks me about my ex boyfriends. 

I was dating a guy who was a little bigger and his response was “why did you date him? He was such a douche and did the bed break when you were with him”

One night ( a few months ago) he wanted to watch a movie and I agreed. He turned the lights off and halfway through the movie I didn’t feel comfortable. I explained to him I was tired and wanted to go to my room. I left and he started sending me abusive text messages about how I was so rude to leave. I responded back saying I have the right to leave the room if I want to. 

I also explained that I didn’t want anything more to do with him than just a housemate- that’s it. He again got angry saying that he only wanted me as a friend. 

This guy walks around in expensive brands and always has to buy the latest Apple product even though he has perfectly good Apple products already. (He works in a grocery store)

Recently, the last 2 weeks, I’ve decided to buy the game UNO to get everyone together and have some fun as usually everyone sits in there seperate rooms and don’t socialise. 

The only person who wants to play UNO is David. He’s starting to ask me questions like: “have you had sex in the shower before” “we should play UNO in my room” “if you ever want to come into my room, you can” “have you been to a strip club before” 

Lately he’s said to me “we should seriously go for a drive” or “we should go to this particular place where there is a lookout over the city” then when I said “no” he says “we can go anywhere where you want to go”

Last night he says to me “tomorrow let’s go out for dessert after your work” I said “no, because I just don’t want to” 

Since then this guy has completely ignored me and will sit ages away from me on the other side of the room. 

It’s been super awkward and it’s obvious he’s pissed off because I keep rejecting him. 

I’m not sure where to go from here or what to say to him?

I really want him to move out of the house.

TLDR: housemate has made advances towards me and is asking inappropriate questions. He is now ignoring me and it’s super awkward."
13,"How do I [32F] protect my work relationships from a bad nepotistic hire?


**TL;DR:** Senior colleague hired his wife to join my team and she sucks, how do I manage the relationship with her and minimise collateral damage to my own relationship with other colleagues who are friends with her?

...

Details:

I work for a small company with 11 employees, soon to be 16. I like my job and most everyone I work with, bar one member of the senior team I'll call Gavin \[40M\]. Gavin isn't the top of the food chain but he has a lot of clout, as the CEO really likes him and handpicked him to join the company based on their past relationship.

Most of the people at my company have worked with each other before in past roles or know each other personally. Hiring friends is the norm, though I'm one of the few ""outsiders"". This hasn't been an issue at all up until recently, when Gavin hired his wife Donna \[F39\] to work part time at the company and asked her to work on some of my projects without consulting me first. I only found out she was going to share projects with me on the day she started.

Unfortunately, Donna is not experienced nor naturally talented in the work she's been assigned. She's been insecure, needy and anxious from day one, and lacks the basic skills necessary to do her job well. I've tried to help her adjust because I would actually welcome some help with my workload, but she pulls me into meetings for an hour or two every time she's in the office, asking me really basic questions and/or just quietly panicking at me. She also does this with CEO, who she knows personally through Gavin.

I've tried to pull away a little bit by not responding instantly to her Slack messages and not accepting every meeting she's tried to book with me. The result has been that she's started interrupting me in meetings, asking basic but usually inappropriate questions addressed to me. I don't think she's intentionally undermining me because she's always grateful when I 'help' her but I'm finding it hard to stay patient. Gavin, of course, always chimes in to support her in team settings. 

I've also tried to build my 1:1 relationship with Donna so there's enough trust to establish boundaries, but unfortunately I can't really find much common ground with her. She's quite negative, complaining loudly that no one at the company has their shit together and I feel like she probably says the same things about me to her husband and the CEO outside the office.

There are very subtle signs that the CEO may be starting to realise hiring her wasn't a great idea - if she wasn't Gavin's wife I think she'd definitely be on her way out, so I think my best strategy here is to wait this out and try to stay calm. However, the CEO booked a 1:1 with me next week and if he asks me about Donna I'm not sure what I'll say. I feel the resentment growing, not just at Gavin and Donna, but also at the CEO for not even trying to promote a fair work environment.

 I don't want to ruin my place in the company over this. My question is, how do I handle Donna while covering my own ass? And what should I say if asked about what I think of Donna's work?"
14,"My girlfriend [22f] tries to talk to me in French. She seems to get annoyed or frazzled when I don't understand her. I'm [24m] from Arizona and I don't speak French.


Hey guys. I started dating a Québécois (I hope I spelled that right) girl about 4 months ago.

She is a really great girl and we have both expressed that we feel we've got a future. 

We've only got one mild little issue that gets a little annoying sometimes. Her first language is French. Her English is just fine, but when shes emotional or getting really animated about something shes got a habit of slipping into speaking French without seeming to notice.

And that is fine and all, its a cool sounding language. But I don't speak French and it seems like she gets frustrated or upset when I miss something due to her speakong a different language.

Today for example. She was over at my place using my game system and was playing with some friends from back home. She was speaking in French to them. I mentioned to her that I was running into town for a few minutes. She said something back in French. I figured it was just like a farewell phrase or something so I just said ""Yeah, you too Darlin'"" and went on with my day.

When I got back she came running up and asked if I got her coffee. I was confused and told her no, I didnt know she wanted coffee. She told me she asked me to pick some up from a place in town we both like right before I left. I had to think for a second and then asked her ""Wait is that what you said in French right before I walked out?"" She had to think about herself for a sec but then answered ""Probably"". I just reminded her that I *still* dont speak French. She made an annoyed little grunt but then continued with her game. She did apologize afterward, just for the record.

But thats kinda thing happens alot. When she is either excited or upset she seems to switch back to her first language, and then gets kind of upset or frustrated when I mention that I dont speak French and have no idea what she said.

Is there like a better way to say it to her? Shes a great girl otherwise and Im not knocking her language or anything. Its just mildly annoying that she gets frustrated with me for not understanding a language I have no reason to have learned.

Is there a different approach I should take? 

**TL;DR**: Girlfriend tries occasionally to talk to me in French. I dont speak French and she gets frustrated when I dont understand."
15,"How do I F/38 ever trust another person again after husband M/35 has been leading a double life of a 10 year relationship?


This is long, it’s also something that if you read it in a fictional novel, it would be too far fetched to believe. 

I have been with my husband for ten years, we met backpacking. Moved to NYC, married, had two kids, moved to the burbs. 
I have a fairly high powered job, he does also. 
The last three years have been tense, and that’s putting it mildly. He has been what I now learn is gaslighting. Moving things so I think I’m crazy, saying conversations never happened, telling me I said things that I then second guessed myself. It was so slow, so convincing, that I started to question if I was losing my mind. 
He also ‘worked’ a lot. Coming home at midnight, sometimes not at all. Always answering his phone, but convincing me I was insane, nagging. Everything I thought I wasn’t. 
Our daughter was sick when she was six months old, no one could figure out what it was. One morning, I woke up and the entire bed was covered in blood (milk and blood in that milk) makes for a horror scene that no parent on earth should ever face. My husband was in the city with his family drinking. I drove at a ridiculous speed into the children’s hospital to the emergency room and called him. Did he rush to us, no. Did he also check in every hour to see how she was, also no. He continued to sightsee with his family, on tour buses, of a city he lived in. At midnight, he calls me to tell me he missed the train and will be spending another night in Manhattan. Out of his mind drunk. I had to remind him we had another child at home with a sitter. Only then, did some remorse show and he tried to come to the hospital drunk. 
*this is just one instance of many where I should have left, but I genuinely started to think I was what he kept saying I was. 

Fast forward three years. I can’t take it anymore, I’m physically sick from the anxiety, not being able to sleep, always exhausted, always confused, memory hazy all the time. I ask for a divorce. 
He tells me the only way he’ll give a divorce that isn’t a war, if I give him 150k dollars for his share of the house. We’re comfortable, not loaded. He didn’t initially want to see the kids bar every other weekend, and I pushed for him to see them twice a week at least. We agree, divorce is written up. 
Five months later, he still hasn’t signed it, and my son keeps telling me about how he is hanging out with a really good friend of mine, which is weird, cause she was there with me telling her all the horrible things he has done. I check the phone bill, in my name, that I’m still paying for, for him. And they have been talking, every day, all day, months and months and months. Long before I ask for the divorce. I go crazy at him only. I tell her never to contact me again. They both call me crazy, tell everyone who will listen that I made up the text messages. One friends asks me (on them meeting up in secret) is ‘an omission really a lie though?’ 
So I just stop. I stop talking about everything. I go to work, I come home and spend time with the kids, I sleep. I want this horrible year to be over. 
Eight months after asking him for a divorce, he says he wants more. The house sold, the kids should move, he wants it in writing that he never has to ever spend one cent on them, or support them, unless it’s on his terms. He also wants them to move back and forth between us every 48 hours until they turn 18. 
So I filed for a divorce and start gathering my bank statements. Then I discovered one of his, a bank statement. It had a rub and tug place on it, from when my daughter was a few weeks old. I go back to the phone bills. In six months, 11 escorts. The world starts to become very dizzy. Every week, for the duration of our relationship, he saw an escort. Good times and bad, pregnant and not. Drug dealers numbers on the phone. Strange receipts on his bank statement. Sex websites, gas stations for small amounts that I’m assuming are condoms. 

How? People who have cheated, been cheated on. How do you do this, this never ending double life, that if caught, the sheer devastation to a person who loved you this would cause? 

And people who have been cheated on. How did you ever learn to trust someone again, because as I sat in the doctors office, getting vaginal scrapes and blood drawn for HIV. I couldn’t ever imagine another human giving me a hug, much less trusting them with any piece of my soul.

TL;DR! husband has been seeing escorts every week for ten years, spending thousands of dollars and not using protection. Feeling violated and bitter at the world"
16,"UPDATE: My [23F] boyfriend [25M] of 8 months feels indifferent towards our relationship. Is this the end, or is there still hope?


Link to earlier post: [https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/chgk9a/my\_23f\_boyfriend\_25m\_of\_8\_months\_feels/?utm\_source=share&amp;utm\_medium=web2x](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/chgk9a/my_23f_boyfriend_25m_of_8_months_feels/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x)

Even though my earlier post only attracted the attention of about 5 people, I wanted to post an update anyway. I listened to what everyone had been saying and gave myself a cut-off date of about 2-3 weeks to see if things were getting better. However, as most of the commenters suggested would happen, they didn't. In fact, they got worse, since I was filled with so much anxiety in those 2-3 weeks, constantly wanting to know what would happen and filled with so much uncertainty in regards to where we stood.

In the end, we broke up, but on amicable terms. Even though he had been the one to initially suggest the idea, by the time the actual break up conversation came around, it felt mutual. He said that at the root of things, he felt like it was mostly just the long distance that made him feel the way he did, and he thinks that maybe if circumstances were to ever change and we were no longer long distance, we could try again. I agreed, but I don't plan on waiting for him and putting my life on hold for the idea. 

We were best friends during the time that we dated, and we still talk regularly with equal effort on both parts, and so I'm hopeful that our transition from a couple to just friends would be a smooth one. Thanks everyone for the advice on my last post! :)

TLDR: We broke up, but we're still friends. Thanks for the advice, everyone!"
17,"My [29] boyfriend [28] won’t stop paying for dinner for large groups of people/wastes food regularly


Throwaway, but I need to purge and I also need perspective. My boyfriend is a wonderful guy. He’s sweet, smart, eloquent, handsome, attentive, and, above all, generous...a bit too generous. I come from a very different background than he does—his family is very wealthy, like mom has never worked a day in her life wealthy, dad makes half a million a year wealthy, while my parents are academics who worked hard, saved, and taught me and my siblings to value every dollar we earn. 

I want to acknowledge that I’ve lived a privileged life, but I was cut off at 21, made classic overdrafting mistakes, and came out on top after learning how to spend (and save) within my means. I have no debt, and rely on my family for nothing. My boyfriend, however, still has an “emergency” family credit card at 28 and does not bat an eye at the price of anything. He does not spend wisely on his own dime. He pays for large groups of friends to eat dinner nearly every weekend, over orders food every time we eat out, and throws much of it away. 

It’s conditioning. My parents put a lot of emphasis on the importance of knowing how to cook, being resourceful, and finishing everything on my plate, and the leftovers after. He doesn’t cook, loves to eat out, and sometimes I sense a sickening attitude of elitism in his actions of throwing food away. The only thing we fight about is food. For the two of us, he will order enough for easily four. This is conditioning from his father, whom I’ve seen do this time and time again. But he does not make the money his father does. I’m really independent, so I frequently offer to pay for things, too, when it’s just us, but when we go out to dinner with people he always makes this grandiose gesture of paying for the whole meal. 

In rare cases it’s on the fam card. Mostly, it’s not. The bottom line is, if I were to marry this person, and we were to share an account, he would have access to more money, and he would, without a doubt, spend it frivolously.

Here’s the main catch: his family has zero savings and a lot of debt, while my family has zero debt and a lot of savings. This includes stocks/bonds for me, that I have touched only for the continuance of my education. While he is a wonderful person who I feel strongly about spending the rest of my life with, I fear his financial ego and the judgement that would no doubt be put on me by his family if I asked for a prenup. 

To the point: tonight at dinner, I called him out in front of a group of close friends for trying to pick up the check (total of 6 people, so about $130 minus tip). I’ve never done this before. He tried to valiantly grab it when everyone had their cards out, including me, and everyone fought him a little but faltered because the other downside of this is people frequently use him and he doesn’t see it, and I snapped at him to stop policing the check and let people pay their share.

I’m embarrassed, and he’s embarrassed, and the rest of the night was awkward. He was calm but wouldn’t look me in the eye. When we had a moment alone, I said I didn’t mean to make a scene, but this has been going on far too long, and that it bothers me that after all of our private conversations he continues to manhandle dinner checks for what? Attention? Adoration? I vowed to never bring it up in public again, but hours later he’s still cold. I didn’t say this part, but the truth is he doesn’t make the money his father does, or that I do, and his spending on food is out of control and totally unnecessary. On top of that, he is is spiteful of apps like Venmo because he feels that asking for money is beneath him, like suggesting people pay for their meal is crude and lacks class, while in reality this is the norm. 

Now he hasn’t come to bed and I’m sick over it, but I stand by my position. I know this is a rarity. I’ve seen a lot of posts about the guy not paying for shit, and while I’m grateful for his willingness to pick up a check, this is gratuitous and unhealthy for both his bank account and my faith in his ability to ever spend responsibly. 

TLDR: My boyfriend’s spending is out of hand, and it’s a nearly weekly occurrence that he picks up substantial dinner checks for large groups of people, which he ultimately cannot afford. I called him out in public and I feel so guilty over it, but not sure how to rectify my behavior in a way he will understand as he comes from a significantly wealthier background. What to do to get through to him, and also make things right?"
18,"My [30F] brother [36M] has organised an ill-advised surprise party for my father [70M]


Our Dad \[70M\] is a complete introvert. When we were younger, he never brought friends round to the house or went out very often. He likes his own space and has always (to my chagrin) used excessive alcohol to handle social engagements.

Although he's not officially diagnosed (he's very oldschool and would *never* get psych help) my Dad shares a lot of common ground with people on the autism spectrum (I know because I am one). He likes things to be a certain way, and can get quite stressed if everything is not perfectly to his taste. He hates loud places/groups of people, and it takes him a couple of days to recover from social events.

He's the kind of guy who refused to make a speech at my sister's wedding because the idea of standing up in front of a group was too mortifying, and missed her first dance because the second-hand embarrassment of seeing other people dance was too much.

So imagine my reaction when one of my brothers, ""James"" \[36M\] reveals via text that he has organised a surprise birthday party of 70-80 people to greet my Dad at a booked-out restaurant in 2 weeks' time. Including the following extremely awkward confirmed attendees:

* His estranged sister (our aunt), a religious fanatic, and her husband (whom we all loathe and don't speak to)
* His ex wife (our Mom) who is hated by aforementioned estranged sister 
* Some randoms he worked with before retirement and hasn't spoken to in 5 years
* Our neighbour and his family (whom he despises)

As you're probably gathering from this post, my Dad is far from perfect and can be pretty difficult to deal with. That said, the last thing I want is for him to feel ambushed, stressed out, and humiliated on his own birthday. This event sounds like the exact opposite of something he would enjoy, and I have absolutely no idea what possessed James to go ahead with it.

I personally feel that organising this is more about James' own ego than the enjoyment of our Dad, as James is highly extroverted and the kind of person who thinks everyone *needs* to be as outgoing as them. He is not a bad guy, but not exactly the most empathetic. It pains me to make him feel bad for trying to organise something nice, but I feel that I have to step in, either to stop the party from happening, covertly dis-invite a few people, or warn my Dad.

Is it reasonable to ask James to call off the party? Is it reasonable to warn my Dad if the party goes ahead?

Or do I just kick back with a glass of strong liquor and watch the drama unfold?

**tl;dr: Dad hates parties/people. My brother has organised a 70-person strong surprise party, which would be hell for my Dad and a bit awkward for the rest of us. My sister and I think this is a nightmare idea. What would you do?**

Thanks in advance!"
19,"My (21F) professor is either really bad at names or is actively making fun of mine.


Throwaway account because I don't wanna taint my own.

Pretty much as the title says. I have a unique name. It's Spanish and it starts with a letter that most Americans never really see, ever. That's okay! I've been bullied over it and it is definitely a sore spot to me, but I can definitely tell when someone is actually trying to say my name and when they're actively making fun of me.

Anyways, one of my professors is trying to learn the names of everyone in his class. I think that's really admirable of him, because that class has around 100 kids in it on a full day. So far, he's doing pretty well, I think. He always tries someone's name before asking them a question and he's usually right!

Now, today he came up to me while I was working on something and asked me how to say my name. I was totally cool with this! I've probably phonetically sounded out my name for people more than I've actually said my name normally. I did my thing, but when he said my name back to me, the very first letter was completely wrong. Like mixing up a g and an i, wrong. Like totally wrong. I corrected him politely and he continued saying it wrong. I corrected him a few more times.

He then proceeded to tell me, ""I'll just call you 'ke'."" Yes, literally like the word key. No my name is no where near that short nor does it start with a k, nor does the first letter of my name even remotely sound like k. I then was getting a bit annoyed and I told him, ""If you call me that, I won't respond, because that's not my name."" He laughed and walked away without another word.

He called me that a couple more times and I honestly was so close to tears. I've had high schoolers do this exact same thing to me, but it especially hurts when it's your professor. The girl sitting next to me must have seen how upset I was, because she started talking to me and saying my name perfectly, after kindly asking how to pronounce it and then complimenting it.

I just feel pretty humiliated. My name is hard, I know that. I'm not asking for perfect pronunciation at all! I just would like an effort put in to not actively say the completely wrong name, especially after he asked me how to pronounce it and then brushed it off. 

What do I do here? Am I being too soft? He's never really been mean before, so this is kind of a surprise to me. Do I let it slide and just try to survive for the next however many months are left in the semester? I just really want some advice, especially from other people with unique or uncommon names. I don't want to go full scorched earth or anything, because this is a difficult class and I want to keep my professor and mine relationship in tact, just in case I need help later.

TL;DR - My professors ignored me when I told him how to pronounce my name. Calls me a name that is nowhere near what my name is or sounds like. I feel humiliated."
20,"My step sister (20F) texted me (21M) last night asking why we aren't close anymore and I said its because how bad we treated each other growing up, should I feel bad for not wanting to be close with her?


My mom died when I was 6, and my dad remarried when I was 9, the women he married had a daughter one year younger than me so she was 8. At first I loved having a new ""mom"" she wasn't the best and will never replace my real mom but I appreciate her trying to be there for me and I am pretty close with her and my dad. At first I loved having a ""sister"" and we got along great, I loved having a play mate during vacations and always having a player 2.

The problems really started to amp up when I was 13 and she was 12, it seemed like no matter what I did went unpunished in her eyes and she had to mock me constantly. Being a hot headed 13 year old usually meant id retaliate and we would have those long screaming matches till either of our parents told us to knock it off or they would send up to different parts of the house to cool off.

I also started playing football in high school and my problem was that I was constantly getting injured. In 8 years (11-18) I broke my arm, pinky, wrist, got 2 concussions, tore my ACL, sprained my MCL and dislocated my shoulder. On top of all that I was kinda chubby, I don't wanna say I was fat (I was about 180-210 from the ages of 14-18 at 6'2). She used to make fun of me for my injuries and my weight which were very touchy subjects for me her favorite insult was ""you fat cripple loser!"" or ""maybe if you lost some weight you wouldn't get injured so often."" Back then those insults really pissed me off but I kept trying to be the ""older brother"" and just told her to shut up, fight back or storm off.

She also loved to embarrass me when friends were over by bringing up dumb stuff I did when I was like 9 or 10 (my friends are great people but we tease each other a lot and would usually remember anything embarrassing we did and bring it up later). So whatever she said to them would always get back. I did talk with her if she could just shut up when I have my friends over, and she basically told me to F off and that its her house too. At this point in my life (16yo) I am super pissed at how shitty she has treated me over the years, I know I caused some if and usually fought back when she got snippy and bratty at me but I rarely started a fight.

I did try to talk to my dad and step mom about the way me and her treat each other and they basically said its normal ""sibling rivalry"". Her antics got a lot worse and her words got more and more mean filled and vile, which meant I would retaliate with just as mean and vile filled insults.

I moved out when I was 18 without ever sending her a text message goodbye or even telling her I was moving out. the past 5 years of unpleasantness between us made me happy that I didn't have to see her. A year later she moves out and I still resented her for how we treated each other. We go almost 2 years without speaking other than on holidays and thats really only dry stuff nothing big. I am no 22 and she's 21 and I got a text the other night asking why we aren't close like we were when we were kids. I basically said I don't care to get along with you or get close because of how we treated each other as kids. She told me to grow up and not even an hour later I get a call from my dad asking why I have so much hate for my ""sister"" years since we have lived together. I told him ill be cordial and won't cut her out of my life but I don't need or want to be close with her.

TL;DR:Me and my sister treated each other terribly growing up and now I don't really care to be close with her."
21,"Is it possible for my (28f) marriage to my husband (29m) to be saved?


Hi all, 

Throwaway account.

I'm really just wondering if anyone out there has experience with how to salvage a marriage, or if ita even possible. My husband and I have been married for 3 years now and it was rough at first, but in the last year its gotten really bad. I quit my job to move cross country with him and it's been a massive fight since then to let me get a job. Sometimes it gets physical. So, I tried to go to school. Again, fight every time I tried to get space to do my homework. He'd sit behind my computer while I was trying to do assignments just repeating how he didnt want to be apart, sometimes even just shutting my laptop in the middle of work or exams. These particular times, I tried locking myself in the bathroom to finish, but had bang on the door or would bang his head into the hardwood floor until I came out or relented to him coming in. Needless to say, I had to drop the program.  

It got to a point where I'd go to work with him to sit in the parking garage while he was on shift for 9 hours sometimes in 20 degree temperatures. This sounds crazy typing it out now. And honestly it's hard to say how it got to this point, its feels like things have progressed little by little. If I wanted to stay home, it'd be yelling and physicality and then blame about how hes going to lose his job if he doesnt get to work but refusing to leave without me. 

He ended up losing his job anyway and didnt look for work for 8 months because he didnt want to be apart. He burned through my savings in this time, so I dont have funds saved up to leave. He also ended up having to file for bankruptcy shortly after.

About a year ago, he got a work from home job and, again, its fighting every time I try to leave the room. I dont like conflict at all and honestly it's so overwhelming to deal with the restraints all the time, but the other end of that is constant yelling and physical fights. Hes pushed my head into pillows and the mattress until I've passed out once. My arms have been covered in bruises. One of the things he does most often is push on the gas while we're driving and slam on the brakes. I've gotten seatbelts burn a couple times.

I've tried leaving a few times. The first time, I tried running on foot and he was able to catch up and threw me back into the apartment. The second, I tried driving away and he jumped on the car and banged on the windshield and windows while on it until I got out. I didnt want to hurt him by driving off. Third time was similar. 

I think I broke in March when he had his way with me even though I blatantly told him that he didnt have my consent for the 6th time in our marriage. 

In April I was diagnosed with an autoimmune disease. Its progressively getting worse. I dont know if stress has anything to do with  it. 

I know I'm not perfect either. I've yelled at him more than a few times and have gotten really angry. My mental health has deteriorated and I feel like I don't meet his needs anymore and I'm being a really crap wife. 

I'm sorry this is so scattered. I feel so lost and dont know how I got here. I've told my mom, after a lot of back and forth within myself, and she said everyone has troubles in their marriages and I have to make this work. 


Tldr; My husband and I have had a pretty turbulent marriage and I'm just wondering if it's possible for a marriage to be saved."
22,"I'm devastated. I [27F] found out my husband [31M] has been cheating on me.


 

I'm so devastated. I thought he was my soulmate. We have been married for 4 years. Apologies in advance, this is gonna be long...

Outside of our sex life, we had been getting along great - he's my best friend and my only family in the state that we live in. In regards to our sex life, for the past year or so, we have only been having sex every few week, because he has ""been stressed from work and can't get in the mood."" (No, I haven't gained weight or gone through any physical changes. I look the same as when we started dating.) I KNEW something was up, especially since he's been leaving early to go to work and staying out late to ""go to the gym."" He is into fitness, but not fanatical. I never accused him of cheating or lying, but I did ask him many times (after laying awake and crying) if he was still attracted to me and if something else was taking his attention. He would always gaslight me and make me feel completely crazy.

That was until a few mornings ago, I was looking for my husbands headphones in his work bag, since mine are broken. I found a birthday card in his bag (his birthday was about a week ago) with a cutesy message along the lines of ""you always make me feel better...blah blah blah,"" signed the same unique pet name he has been calling me for years. I never invade his privacy or go through his phone, and I only looked at the card because I had a weird feeling when I saw it.

When I confronted him about it, he said that it was from a girl he met at Chipotle (she was working there) on his lunch break. She had been working and they got into conversation and somehow it came up that her mom had recently passed. Interesting convo for the Chipotle line... His mom passed 3 years ago and he claimed that he was helping her get through it; he had connected with her on an emotional level and that was it - an emotional affair. He claimed that he would see her at work to talk and they texted sometimes, but they never hung out outside of that. He said this had been going on for a month. I wasn't buying it.

I fought him for his phone, which he had changed the passcode to, and reluctantly he gave me the code. I looked for text messages, but they had been deleted, so I sent myself her contact info. Mind you, all of this happened an hour and a half before I had to leave for work. So I left a bit early and called her. She didn't answer, so I went to work and put on my best catatonic face, while my hands were still shaking and I was on the verge of tears all day.

Shockingly, she called me back around my lunch break. I returned her call and she told me everything. She has never worked at Chipotle. They met on the dating app OKCupid. He messaged her first. He had been to her house, taken her out to dinner, and even had sex with her multiple times. This had been going on for about 4 months and she had no idea he was married, she thought they were heading towards a relationship (they had even talked about ""relationship stuff"")...he even gave her a fake name. Now that I know he's been on a dating app, I assume he's done this with other women as well.

At this point, I'm disgusted and devastated. He's sleeping on the couch, but we're still in the same home. He has been apologizing profusely and saying that I'm his priority, he loves me, and wants to work it out. I still love him so much, and feel for him because of the loss of his mother. But I can't love him at the expense of doing the best thing for myself. I just don't think I can trust him again. People like him are the reason why before I met him, I didn't believe in marriage. I hate being deceived and he knew that trust and honestly was the most important thing to me when he met me.

The kicker is that I've told him multiple times that I would be open to an open relationship as long as there was good communication, boundaries, and transparency. He always said there was no way he'd be into that, and opted to do his dirt in the dark and be a complete coward. The fact that I found the card, gave him the opportunity to come clean, and he continued to try and deceive me tells me that he may never be honest with me, and will likely do this again. I don't think I can trust him again, and I wonder if I'll be able to trust anyone. I've loved him and been a great partner to him and if he ever had an issue, he knows he could have come to me with it.

Currently, I am in school SUPER full-time (learning a trade, so it's gonna be a year of Mon - Fri, 9 hours a day), I run a business which is still in it's beginning stages so I do not yet pay myself, and work a regular job 1 day a week. I never wanted to depend on a man for this very reason, but I trusted him and knew it would only be temporary. Unfortunately, I just started school so I still have almost a year to go, and I have no plans on quitting, but no idea what else I can do. I also don't have a car or many friends in this newish city. So basically - there aren't enough hours in the day for me to attend school and support myself if I chose to left, especially not in my expensive city. I really am in a pickle, and any advice or shared experience would be so helpful.

TL;DR I found out my husband was cheating from a birthday card, he continued to lie about what transpired between them, and I only found out the truth by contacting the woman he was cheating with."
23,"My [37M] husband told me [26F] that he isn't sexually attracted to me since I gained weight


So, we've been married for 7 years. I am 6 feet tall, tall for a woman. I've never been much of a petite delicate flower. I was about 140 pounds when we got married, but that weight sits very slim on my figure. I honestly could have gained a few at that time. I'm now up to 185, which is significantly more than I was when we met. I'm tall mind you, and I play sports so I do have a lot of muscle weight. I'm not obese, but I am a little heftier than I used to be. Tummy, little muffin top, a bit of arm giggle. My husband is a pretty average weight, I'm in better shape than he is honestly. He's a little rolly polly in the middle. I was honestly shocked when he told me. Our sex life has been winding down and we got into an argument about it yesterday. He hit me with ""Not everyone wants to fuck a fat miserable c***"". Seriously the worst thing he's ever said to me. I was shocked. He then later apologized and said ""I didn't mean to tell you so harshly, but I can't perform anymore because I just have no reason to be attracted to a saggy body."" I asked him why he didn't tell me sooner and he just shrugged and said he hoped I would take care of myself better once my clothes got tighter and was just waiting for me to take action. Should I explain to him more why this was so hurtful, or does this sound like something problematic enough to consider divorce? It feels like he's just completely disrespecting the sanctity of our marriage, is that crazy? He told me he ""wants what he married"". Am I wrong to disagree? I need some help. My family is so traditional that when I told my sister about this she told me ""well, your husband is telling you what he wants before running off to someone else. You're lucky you're getting a chance."" Am I lucky? 

TL;DR I gained weight and my husband doesn't want to have sex with me. Do I lose it to become happy in the marriage again or leave him?"
24,"An old friend (30sF) recently contacted me (30M) in a creepy/cringey way - how do I react properly?


Hi!  
When I was a teen (around 15), I was super into the goth and emo scene, which made me kind of an outsider at school - I was bullied and didn't have a lot of friends. Being closeted gay didn't make things easier. I started to use a website for similar minded people where I met ""Sophie"". We started messaging, liked the same bands, had the same problems with school and our problems and we became close friends. We messaged almost non stop and she was there whenever I was down and I tried to do the same for her. I think she developed a crush on me but she knew that I'm gay. She even visited me once and we had a really good time together and we joked that we would share a flat in a big city someday. Our friendship lasted about three intense years - I don't even know how things ended. The was no fallout or anything, I guess we both just grew up, left home to study and found new friends.  
I kinda forgot about her, to be honest. In the beginning, I wondered what she was up to or if I should try to contact her, but I never did. Fast forward to 2019 - I'm 30, openly gay and have an awesome boyfriend and haven't thought of Sophie in 10 years tbh. I just recently changed jobs but am still on good terms with my old workplace. Three weeks ago, a colleague from said old job messaged me that they received a letter for me and I ""reaaaally needed to get it 😂"". The thing is: all our work mail goes to a central department, where the letters are opened and then sorted by name. I headed over the next day and lo and behold - it's a letter from Sophie. She must have googled my name and found the company I worked at and then send the letter to our central address. It's a long, kitschy, emo poem on one page, on the other it's just ""do you still think of me sometimes? I think of you all the time"". I was extremely embarrassed, grabbed the letter and went home. Since then, a similar letter arrived every week but without a sender address (unlike the first one), so I can't have them sent back.  
I really don't know how to handle this. To be honest, I'm not really interested in this friendship anymore, it's been such a long time ago and I don't know if we have that much in common anymore. Judging from her letters, she's still stuck in the same mindset when we were teenagers. I also feel like this whole thing is really weird and creepy, my old co workers are stuck between making (friendly) fun of me and starting to wonder if I have a stalker.  
Should I ignore this? Should I send her a letter back or will a rejection of any kind escalate this behaviour? Am I unreasonably mean and should I just give her a chance?   

  
**tl;dr:** An old friend from when I was a teen recently contacted me at my old workplace by sending cringey letters. I'm not really interested in having any contact with her. What should I do?"
25,"Voluntarily unemployed wife (34) refuses to return to work despite impending financial problems


Married 12 years. One child who is 6. Wife had a great career (nearly making six figures) that she abandoned when our child was 1. There was no discussion about this. She got laid off and just decided she wasn't going to work any longer and didn't ask if that was OK. 

For the first 2 years we were ok. My income  increased and we cut back expenses.  I also received some money after the passing of a loved one. During this time my wife developed a prolific shopping career and ran $80k through a credit card in 24 months. I paid it off every month until my income took a big decrease (comp plan change) and no longer could. Then debt started piling up. It was at this point that I told her it was time to go back to work. That was nearly 2 years. She has had maybe 3-4 interviews and no offers. 

Fast forward two years and I have a 2nd mortgage, $20k in credit card debt $30k personal loan, and I have blown through $180k in savings. My work career has suffered due to overwhelming stress. I'm in sales and have to be on top of my game but I just can't seem to ever pull it together these days. This year is the worst year of my sales career. Savings is now down to about a 4 month cushion and I'm about to have to spend a month's worth of that on emergency home repairs. I have consulted a divorce attorney twice over the last several years which she knows. I've told her that she has to work whether we are married or not but she ignores this and continues doing her thing. If I even attempt to ask her if she has looked for a job she goes on the aggressive and changes the subject. 

I don't know what to do. We are running on a $1k-$2k per month deficit so savings is decreasing every month. There are no more expenses to cut. The money is eventually going to run out. Our child means more to me than anything and the thought of my lazy wife taking her and going to live with her parents is literally the worst possible situation I can imagine. But I don't know what to do. She refuses to even attempt to find a job. Her laptop (that I bought her specifically to use for ""work"") hasn't been out of its bag in a month. She has regressed from being a successful sales rep to spending hours each day gossiping on the phone. She's 34 going on 13.

Has anyone had a spouse that came back from a similar situation or is the person that she was previously gone forever?

TL;DR:  wife has been voluntarily unemployed for almost 5 years and  refuses to return to work despite certain financial trouble on the horizon"
26,"I (28m) have tolerated my wife's (29f) family's racism and shitty behaviour for close to 9 years. Things have finally come to a head in the wake of my brother in law and his wife trying to literally abduct our daughter. I am at my goddamn limit.


My wife and I are unsure of how the hell to go on in this clusterfuck of a situation. This is a vent and will be LONG. I've repressed this for years. Literally made an account for this.

Necessary context: I am a SAsian (not really practicing) Muslim man. My wife (and obv her family) are white, though the country they are from has its own language \[imp later\]. I met my wife almost 9 years ago, we hit it off, dated, got married 3 years ago, she converted to my religion even though i never asked her to since I don't even practice it myself \[also imp\] and life has been golden.

More necessary context: I've never had the smoothest relationship with my in laws, particularly my wife's father, older brother and older sister throughout my relationship with my wife. Her father, older brother and older sister who I don't get along with are....terrible people and make no move to hide it. They've made some pretty racist remarks sometimes about my home country and my family who all lives in said home country, ""jokingly"" asking ""if they're safe"", ""how many days has it been since they've (my family) seen a bombing?"" and ""warning""??? my wife not to go to my home country if she doesn't want to get blown up ???????????? My wife has always immediately shut it down, even going no contact with her older sister for 4 months after she said that my sister should ""get whitening cream"" before she gets married to ""a man like.....double her age right?"" when we told her that my 24 year old sister was getting married to her same-age ! boyfriend back home. Eventually her family kind of guilted her into resuming contact and I just want peace so I said yea sure. I didn't even get an apology. My wife's older siblings and dad have also been passively aggressively nasty to her every time she's uploaded any photo where she's honouring my culture or when she was putting henna on, trying to learn my language, try to talk her out of being a Muslim that I ""forced her into"" etc etc.  Shit's depressing. Her mother and younger brothers are all okay people (haven't said anything to my face) so I've been okay with them. 

My wife and I just had a little girl in June. Ever since my wife told her family she was pregnant, stuff got insane. Her older brother made her cry multiple times during her pregnancy by telling her over and over that this baby was never going back to my home country if she wanted it in one piece, that this baby was going to be raised according to my wife's culture by HER family (particularly him and his wife), be a christian, that if the baby was dark ""like your husband"" they were gonna bleach it (this was apparently a joke), and they all (even my mother in law) kept referring to our unborn child as ""our"" or ""my baby"" which was CREEPY to us. I finally lost it and went no contact with all of them. My wife was like hell yeah do it and so we made it through a fair few months without getting guilted by any goddamn body.

When the baby was born, however, I could tell my wife was miserable because my family lives on the other side of the globe and hers was not present. I felt soft, my baby girl was beautiful and I thought maybe she'll soften them too and make them a little less horrible. So, i made a mistake and just begrudgingly contacted them and said they're welcome to visit her any time and that we shouldn't fight, but they had to cut their remarks to my wife out (they could say anything to me instead) and we would raise this baby however WE wanted.

They were ecstatic! They came over when we were settled, brought over a lot of gifts, watched the baby when we were bone tired (that was my mother in law because I do NOT trust anybody else in their family with my little girl for, what i assume and now know, is good reason), and everything was okay. Her older siblings were coming over more often than they ever had and it was making me kind of uncomfortable but like, whatever. My baby is cute. They wanted to see her, so fine. There was an incident in August where her older brother and his wife came over while my mother in law was babysitting and we were asleep, took out our baby in her stroller without our permission, spent three hours or so (i think) outside with her, mother in law left without telling us leaving us still asleep and made us freak out in silence when we woke up about where our baby went for a full hour with my mother in law or anyone in her family NOT ANSWERING their phone before they came back with our girl and said they went on a ""walk"". I almost went berserk and cut contact right then but me and my wife thought we were collectively overreacting so we just accepted their ""apology"" because they're family. They were salty when we told her mother she was not welcome to babysit anymore but other than that, it was going ""well"" until like four days ago when they finally decided to stop playing nice. 

My older sister visited my wife while I was at work four days ago and told her that she'd been watching and she wanted me to stop being around the baby so much, ""babbling""?? in my language, that the baby had to learn THEIR language because she's white passing, and be Christian or she'd turn out ""like a Muslim mess"" and that my wife could, under no circumstance, put her in a hijab when she was older. I DONT PRACTICE MY RELIGION THAT MUCH. No one in my family wears a hijab, neither does my wife???????? Not that there's anything wrong with it. My wife understandably was livid as hell, told her to mind her business and told me what her sister said straight away on the phone. She then blew up her family group chat and told them to never come over if they were going to say things like this. A hero. 

They had a little bit of an argument after (the details were horribly racist I'm assuming) which led to my wife banishing them to no contact again. She was upset, I was upset that she was upset but she said that I could never talk to them again until she was ready to establish contact again which was never. Not even her mother and younger brothers. I was like okay. Two days passed, they were pretty silent. And then yesterday her older brother and his wife came over in the afternoon, wanting to talk it out. My baby was in her crib upstairs asleep and we literally were like no, this is not happening again, enough chances have been given. He was being pretty tame about it, then his wife said she wanted to use the toilet, we were like ok, she went upstairs. Didn't think too much of it. 

And she came downstairs. With our fucking daughter in her arms. 

My wife freaked, I freaked (considering what had happened in August) and his wife claimed that it was just because our daughter was ""crying"" (SHE WAS STILL ASLEEP) and she wanted to soothe her. She also then said in quote ""oh I'm gonna take my baby out. Like put her in my car and drive her around until she stops crying"" (ASLEEP!?) and proceeded to walk out my door while my brother in law BLOCKED THE DOOR????? and actually made it outside and to her car by the time I managed to bypass her behemoth ass husband to get our daughter back. My wife was in hysterics at this point, I was screaming, my daughter Now was actually crying, it was a dramatic mess and we both had to physically push her brother out of the house and lock the door. 

I don't know what the hell is going on anymore. My wife told them once and for all (yay groupchat) that she's sick and she's done and this was the final straw for her and me. They texted my wife telling her to forgive her brother, he only acted this way because he doesn't have kids ????????????????????????????????????? and he wants time with her. her MOTHER this time jumped in, told her to stop being selfish, that she let her brother take the baby out last month (WITHOUT OUR CONSENT) and that he was only trying to peace make by tryin to kidnap my daughter apparently. Her father also messaged her something along the lines of ""you'll ruin this girl if you raise him with that (ethnic slur about me) c\*\*t"". 

My wife blocked them all on every possible place she can think of. It's been barely 24 hours and other relatives I've never heard of are now crawling out of the woodwork to tell her to reconsider and that you only get one family. This didn't happen when she cut contact during her pregnancy (they just found ways to send her messages once in a while begging her to establish contact/pregnancy updates). I'm not sure why they're so desperate to keep her now but my wife thinks it's because they have some sick claim over our daughter and I feel nauseated. I feel like I don't need advice more than I just need reassurance that me and my wife are doing the right thing. We're extremely shaken, especially when we think that her brother and his wife actually took our baby away from us last month without asking.

Tl/dr: my wife's family has been passive aggressive and racist towards me for all of our relationship. her brother in law and his wife tried to take our daughter away in their car without our consent. we are going no contact forever."
27,"23(M) falling in love with 20(F) who’s in a wheelchair please help I need advice


I met this girl who is totally beautiful and just all around awesome person. She made me change my views on love and relationships and even just online dating in general. Anyway we hit it off and we been non stop texting for months. She lives in the same state as me but hours away so it’s “long distance”. Also another bump in our road to being officially bf n gf is she is disabled and in a wheelchair. Now we have hung out for the weekend in a hotel in her area and it was obviously great us being together meeting for the 1st time was not awkward or anything it’s like we were made for each other it feels like.  Now her being disabled she needs help with somethings we take for granted and I didn’t mind helping when needed but she had people come “care” for her twice a day while we were there. All this was new to me and it was different and kinda weird but I didn’t care cause I really just like this girl a lot. Now no one really knows I’m in a weird long distance relationship that I met a girl online and that the girl is in a wheelchair. What I need with is I’m honestly scared to face the fact that everyone I know is probably gonna say something negative about the situation right off the bat and that I’m not gonna like to hear it and I’m not sure if they can change how I feel about her. I know I may not completely understand or know what I’m getting into and I don’t wanna hurt this girl in the process of finding out. I also don’t want to hurt myself. Please feel free to ask any questions I’ll happily answer. And if anyone who has been in a interabled relationship please help me out let me know what to do what not to do the good the bad all of it.. please help



TL;Dr
I met a handicap girl and I like her I need help telling my friends and fam about her and also advice on dating someone in a wheelchair"
28,"My (28F) husband (35M) doesn’t help around the house and I am losing it


I’ll begin my saying my husband is a great guy, and an even better father. We have been together for 3 years. However, I am absolutely losing it with his lack of helping me around the house. He literally leaves his shit EVERYWHERE. I am home all day with our one year old special needs son. I also work from home which is a benefit for us. He works as a cook and has two days off per week so it’s not crazy hours. He gets home and leaves his shoes, clothes, jacket laying around. He makes a huge amount of dishes and doesn’t wash them. He leaves our sons dirty clothes out instead of putting them in the laundry (that I do!). He doesn’t take out the trash (including the shitty diaper bin, recycle bin, bathroom trash..etc) I do all the laundry. I make the breakfast, get everything ready for the day, mop, sweep, cook.

He comes home from work when the baby is asleep and sits on his phone most nights. When I get the occasional sleep in I wake up to a huge mess which stresses me out even more because I know I’ll wake up to a tornado of crap to do. 

I feel like I am constantly tidying up after him. It’s not easy having a special needs child that needs constant attention and I feel like it is wearing me down. My days are divided between work, therapy appointments, and endless cleaning. I am so rarely in the mood to even have sex anymore because of this. 

I’ve tried the whole “let it get dirty and see if he notices” thing and I just can’t live that way. I try asking him “babe could you please... (insert chore here)” and apparently the way I ask is a problem? Maybe too passive? The other day he said I’m constantly up his ass when all I ask for is a bit of help. It’s like he is bothered that I ask. He told me not to ask anymore.

I just don’t know how to get him to bloody help me. I am running on empty and with everything going on in my life I just need an extra hand. We live in another country and I don’t have family or friends here to help.

How can I get him to help me without nagging? Should I just let it go and do this shit myself? I’m not going to leave him over it, but it’s really causing a lot of anger for me that I feel I’m doing everything myself. Just tonight I asked him to take out the 5!!! Trash bags that were sitting at the door attracting flies and he said no. Instead he plops down on the bed with our son and turns on Netflix. I don’t want to say anything right now because I’ll explode and it will cause a huge fight.

I guess I’m just looking for someone that’s been in a similar situation and got through to their spouse. Sorry for the long and annoying post.

TL;DR My husband doesn’t help me around the house and I am losing it!"
29,"Husband [24M] says I shouldn’t dislike his Dad [50sM] even though he beats his wife


When we were dating my husband told me about how rough his childhood was, and how he grew up having to protect his siblings and mom from getting beat by his dad. It deeply messed up my husband and he’s absolutely nothing like his dad. 

Anyways since we’ve been married I’ve been forced to interact with his dad a lot more than I’d like to, and even though I try to be civil, I can’t respect a man like that for what he did to my sweet MIL and husband. 

This is bugging my husband a lot. Divorce isn’t a thing in their culture (he’s Asian) and he says that even though he doesn’t condone his dad’s actions in the slightest, he still loves him and it’s still his dad. We won’t be getting rid of FIL anytime soon. It makes him upset to see how much I hate his dad. If I bring up or criticize his dad at all, he gets sad. I can’t just not interact with my own FIL. He seems to like me a lot and isn’t a bad guy...  aside from the fact that he used to beat his wife. He hasn’t done it in years. 

How do I deal with this? How do I tell my husband I can’t love his dad the way he does? Therapy is incoming 

TLDR : husband and MIL were abused by dad but still have Stockholm syndrome love for him. I don’t like FIL at all, and it makes my husband upset"
30,"I [25F] identified as a lesbian, now I fell in love with a man [31M]


I always identified as a lesbian. I was involved in LGBT clubs at university, organised lesbian parties etc.

I dated 2 girls,2 relationship lasted 7 months, the other 2 years. Both ended up with them cheating and hurting me a lot. I have now been single for a year.

At work, I met John. He is great and sweet and kind. We hit it off as friends and he confessed his feelings. I think I feel the same.

I feel like a fake lesbian , what Should I do?

Tl;dr: I [25F] identified as a lesbian, now I fell in love with a man [31M, what to do ?"
31,"Me (24F) with my husband of 8 months (25M), together 3 years total. He is more religious than I am, we haven't had sex yet.


We're both Christian and met in church. 

I consider myself more moderate. I definitely believe in God and my faith, but I don't feel that EVERYTHING the Bible teaches is relevant to life in today's world. Our church isn't super strict or fundamental either. Of course some people who go there are, but that's their choice and not because the church is preaching hellfire and brimstone. 

I had 1 sex partner before (I planned on) having sex with my husband. He was my BF since 8th grade, we lost our virginity to each other and broke up after HS. We realized we were just growing apart and going in different directions. I don't regret it or him, he was actually a perfect first boyfriend and I feel he shaped a lot of what I looked for in a relationship. 

When I started seeing ""Kevin"" and we got the stage of discussing sex, he seemed ok with me having already had sex although he had not. I also respected that. I *personally* believe that as long as sex is undertaken with love, communication, commitment and responsibly, how could any God have an issue with that? We weren't put here to live in a bubble and deny the biological drives given to us BY God. 

But I also respect other people's views and rights to do with their body and spirit as they see fit. Kevin wanted to wait until marriage. I told him honestly I wasn't sure, but that I really liked him and while I don't wait until marriage, I also wouldn't want to have sex early in the relationship so we would see how things went. 

Kevin proposed on our 2 year anniversary and we were married shortly after. We had a small outdoor ceremony officiated by our pastor with just our best friends and close family - about 30 people total. It was perfect. Low key, intimate and peaceful. Zero ""wedding stress"". 

We left on our honeymoon the next day. Kevin said he was airsick and wanted to just lay low at the hotel that night. No problem, people sometimes don't feel well. We went to bed early and nothing sexual happened. 

The next night he said he must have had mild food poisoning and didn't feel well. 3rd night was a headache. Fourth the headache was still there. 

By the 5th night I kind of called him out. I said I'd planned on making love with my new husband and if he was nervous I understood, but then please just tell me that and we'll talk through it and work out things we're both comfortable with, that we didn't have to have actual sex right away, we could just start by making out and doing whatever we both liked and stopping if at any point one of us wanted to. 

He felt bad for letting me down but said he hadn't really felt well the whole trip, he wasn't stalling, he didn't know what was wrong. He said maybe he came down with something or he just wasn't travelling well but he didn't want our first time to be when he felt like garbage. I was disappointed but I was glad we talked. 

In news that should shock no one, it's been 8 months and we haven't had sex. He seemed so rational about it while we were dating but since marriage there's either a problem, we'll try making out, he doesn't get an erection and starts beating himself up and I end up consoling him, we fight, or he avoids the topic. 

I told him straight up the other day that I didn't *get married* to be celibate, we have half a relationship, if he's gay or asexual then tell me and we can part ways civilly, of it's a medical issue then GET IT TREATED and if it's an emotional issue we'll go to counseling but if we get to a year with no action I'm done. 

He scheduled a counseling appointment for 2 weeks out. With a *religious* counselor. I love my faith and it's a big part of my life but I'm hesitant to seek faith based counseling on this. I'd rather see a secular counselor who's going to keep faith out of it. Faith is a PART of my life, not my WHOLE life and it's definitely not standing in the way of me having a marriage, at least not from my end. 

He's done what I asked him to do, so I don't feel it's entirely fair to say it's not good enough. But I really do feel it's not good enough. 

He also hasn't scheduled with a medical doctor to address all these ""illnesses"" that seem to crop up around bedtime. 

tl;dr I feel like religion has ruined my marriage 8 months in. We haven't had sex and he's scheduled with a faith based counselor. I gave him an ultimatum and counseling was one option but I don't think we need MORE religion in this marriage. Should I see what happens or just leave and find a partner eventually who can balance hos faith with real life and a real relationship?"
32,"My (f53) uncle (m86) confessed in his will that he is my father


Recently my „uncle“, whom I will call James died aged 86 of cancer. Now we have found his last will. In it he revealed some secrets. He wrote that his brother Timothy was gay. For my entire life I considered Timothy as my father. According to James will, my mom was fully aware of Timothys homosexuality by the time they got married. However she was keen to marry him as she wanted a more free life than most women of her generation had. This is consistent with my memory of her personality. By the time when they got married homosexuality was illegal and socially unacceptable in my country. Also Timothy would have lost his job. They both wanted children. But according to James my mom felt uncomfortable with making Timothy sleep with her, even for conceiving children. So they agreed with James that he should be my brothers and my biological father. James wife agreed to it, as she felt bad for being unable to have children herself.

They did everything possible to keep this secret during their lifetimes, however they agreed that the one of them who would live the longest should confess it in his will. James Wife died in 1994, Timothy died in 2007, and my mom passed away in 2014.

James also wrote that my mom and Timothy genuinely loved my brother and me. He added that  my mom and Timothy in their way loved each other too. They genuinely held each other in high regard.  

Growing up I always felt that their marriage was warmer and more loving than all of my friends parents marriage. They never fought and genuinely relished each others company. By the time I got married I myself hoped that my marriage would be as happy as theirs. So I am sure they were all happy about this.

Should I keep their secret?

But I have a 14 yrs old son. What should I tell him about it?

Is there anything else I should do?

**TL;DR:  My uncle is my biological father. He had an agreement with my parents, my dad was gay.**"
33,"My [M/22] girlfriend's [F/22] social media obsessed life has completely dissipated my feelings for her, but I am afraid that if I end it she is going to put all of my info out to her sick followers, don't know what to do


We have been together for almost 5 years and I am, in my heart and mind, done with this relationship. She has become ""Instagram famous"" in the last year, and although she has respected my wishes and not shown my face or said my name, the fact is that because we spend so much time together when she shares her life and business she is pretty much sharing the details of my life as well and that makes me so uncomfortable. Furthermore, the amount of time and effort she spends online, this extreme sense of vanity that she's developed, and the emotional investment that she has in things that I basically see as not real like social media is supremely unattractive to me. I also feel like the people she is associating with online are causing her morals and values to shift away from mine. She wants to move in together, I want to end this relationship and cut ties, I've realized that any vestigial feelings that I have for her are a mixture of nostalgia and sunken cost fallacies.

Here's the thing, I am a very private person and have worked very hard to keep my name, face and info off of the internet. She's a drama queen and I have seen the disgusting way that she's conducted herself online when involved in meaningless internet spats, I am really afraid that she's going to put my name, photos of my face or personal info about me online and that is one of my worst nightmares.


**TLDR:** I no longer love or even really like my girlfriend of 4 years and want to end it but she is a drama queen with a large online following and I am terrified of her putting my personal info out there out of anger."
34,"My [31 F] mom[63 F] keeps pressuring me and my DH(30M) to give money to my older brother(36m) so his kids can 'live like yours(mine) do'


Older brother was the favorite of us 3(he was the middle, we have another older older brother in his 40s), but has since well messed up his life to say the least.

I and the hubby come from hispanic families, so lower middle class childhoods. He got a scholarship and now has a phd and does research work at a tech company(he said to use the term big n if that matters to anyone reading?). He makes enough money for me to stay at home and work at my dream of being a published author, and our kids have much better childhoods than ether of us did.. We dont brag, but we also dont make the kids lie about what they do or what new game systems they got when we go visit and they are asked how their life is and such.

Brother got in trouble for dealing(hard stuff not weed) in highschool, he does have his GED as of two years ago so at least hes got that going for him, and never really recovered. We(DH and I) dont think he has hard gang connections but also arent sure, since he does still work his mechanic job at the firestone. But he doesnt have a ton of money, and with 3 kids by 3 women he cant afford to take them out, by them a ton, or go on vacations like my DH can for ours.

Hes been hostile to DH ever since they met, he was already 1 degree in with an office job when we started dating and brother tried to act like the big man on campus and tried to throw his literal weight around which failed hilariously. But yeah hes been hostile and tries to casually put him down ever since they met. I know a lot of it is envy/self consciousness but its still no where near ok.

Mom says his kids ask why ours have so much more, and she(says) she gets teary eyed and doesnt know what to say other than luck of the draw. So for the past few weeks shes been trying to talk me into giving some of our money to brother so he can 'finally spoil his kids, with toys and a vacation'. Which i am 100% opposed to. I wouldnt normally mind helping a BIT, but not anywhere near that much or to someone who mistreats the man who actually earns this money.

Im about ready to burn some bridges but , can anyone here come up with better ideas? I'm desperate

TL;DR  He works hard for his money, so they better treat him right.

TL;DR longer ish HD has good job, my brothers a broke drop out with a lotta baby mommas, my mom wants us to pay for them."
35,"My husband (m/32) cheated on me (f27) during the most vulnerable and dependent time of my life and I don't know what to do.


I just started nursing school, we have a small child and I have taken on his daughter fulltime for the past year. I just found out he was visiting ""massage parlors"" and even joined a website to find/review them. 

I'm appalled, disgusted, heartbroken, ect. But the real issue is now, what the fuck am I supposed to do? Last year I quit my job and moved 2,000 miles across the country for his job, I took on an extra kid full time (BM abandoned their daughter with us and became a drug addict, my stepchild is diagnosed bipolar and severely traumatized). I started working two jobs when we moved to make up for the decent salary and comfortable position I left behind. THEN I got into nursing school (something I've always wanted to do) which is supposed to be beneficial to our family. He agreed to take on extra financial responsibility in our home while I went to school, so I quit one job and went part time at the other, AND THEN HE CHEATS ON ME.

Two months ago I could have been 100% self sufficient and move the fuck out to be a single mother. Now I'm so fucked. 

He wants me to stay in the home with him and he will continue to support me. But I've made it very clear we are over. We have split up in the past, and have been going through a lot of issues. He doesn't treat me right and I don't deserve this shit.

I dont know what to do. 

TL;DR My husband is cheating on me. And I just quit my job to go back to school."
36,"My wife of 4 years (30s F) gets very very upset if I (30s M) disagree with how she arranges our home and in particular my things


My wife likes things to be well-arranged.  Or, perhaps I should say that **sometimes**, she likes things to be very clean and well-arranged.  

She always complains about my things not being arranged to her liking.  And I've honestly done my best to accommodate her. 

I keep my desk more or less arranged, I put my things away in my space, I do the dishes, vaccuum, and mop the floor, etc.  I'm not perfect, but I don't really feel like it's normal or healthy to constantly clean things.  

Anyway, before her period, she goes nuts with cleaning and organizing, scrubbing the shower, rearranging things in our cabinets, rearranging things on my desk, and rearranging other things that I use like my protein powder and supplements.  

It's not so much that I mind that she's cleaning, it's just that when she's done, I often can't find things and have to then spend time looking for them or ask her where they are. I've told her that I dislike her going through all of my things and rearranging them because then I can't find anything, but she seems to think that she has the right to clean and arrange things because the way I organize my things is not sufficient for her.

She typically gets really upset when I ask her not to rearrange my things.  She screams, ""fuck you"", over and over again and tells me that she is the only one that does any housework, which is patently false. 


Today, she decided to put my supplements in sealable jars.  I asked her why.  She doesn't use the supplements, though she can if she wants.  I buy them and am the only user.  

For me, the original sealable bag or container is fine and I like to keep the things I use daily on the counter so I can easily access them (I recently had surgery so I'm temporarily disabled right now and am currently in a wheelchair). Filling another jar with a small amount to use for a week and refilling again just seems like a waste of energy.

I told her I didn't like it and she got really, really angry and started screaming and slamming things around before storming off into another room.  Now she won't talk to me.  And probably won't for the next day or so.  

I really don't think her behavior is normal.  It's one thing to disagree, but it's another entirely to scream and to be verbally abusive.  


TLDR; My wife gets really upset and verbally abusive if I object to how she arranges my things."
37,"Me [24F] called the cops on my [30M] drunk BF after he slapped my my phone out of my hands multiple times in an Uber and punched two holes in my wall. Now that he got out he is acting like an entirely different person. Should I believe he changed? Did I do the right thing by calling the cops?


NIGHT OF THE INCIDENT: After a night out drinking, my bf asked me to pick him up.  I called an Uber to pick me up from the bar I was at and met him where he was. When I got there he was trashed and the Uber driver stayed with me to make sure I found him. The same Uber driver drove us back to my house. As we were in the car he slapped my phone out of my hands for no apparent reason and kept calling me hateful names. I kept my cool but the Uber driver was concerned. The Uber driver asked me if he was sure I wanted to take him back to my house.  I said yes. 

When we got home he kept calling me hateful names and I kept asking why he was so mad at me. I was just crying so confused as to why I was being treated the way I was. We got into an argument and punched a hole in my hall wall and then another one in my room. I was scared and called the cops and they immediately arrested him after seeing the damage done to my house. The Uber driver even arrived to the scene because h was concerned about my safety he came back to check on me and testified as a witness to the slapping in the back of the car. 

THE NEXT DAY: I was a wreck. I felt like I had done the wrong thing because I immediately missed him and felt terrible for sending someone I love to jail. His mom called me and said he had asked her to call me from inside of jail to make sure I was okay. she apologized for his behavior and told me I didn’t deserve to be treated like that.He didn’t remember what exactly had happened. I spent the day crying and waiting to hear from him. He had left his phone and I knew I would hear from him eventually because him or someone would have to pick it up. While he was in there I went through his phone and I saw he was snapping another girl while he was drunk. Asking her to come to the bar he was at that night.

TWO DAYS LATER: he was released. He called me to pick up his phone and when he arrived to my house he bawled in my arms ( I have never seen him cry he is not the emotional type at all)  he apologized for everything. He told me that when he was in there he realized that me and his daughter are the only people that mattered to him and he hasn’t been treating me with the respect and love I deserve. He said he was going to quit drinking and said he understood if I was going to break up with him but he begged me stay in contact through everything because he said me and his mom is all that he has. (He has friends so that threw me off) He kept kissing me and asking me to hug him which is very unlike him. He told me that he has taken me for granted and that he was going to do all that he could to make me happy from that day forward. He kept telling me he loves me so much and asked me to wait to break up with him until it’s all over because he can’t take the pain right now. I love him but I am emotionally scarred from the whole situation. 

TODAY: I don’t know if I should give him another chance and I’m still in shock to see he was talking to another girl that night. 

TL;DR did I do the right thing by calling the cops? Do you think he actually changed while he was in there or is he just saying that because he feels bad? What would you do?"
38,"Me (29F) and my husband (29M) have been together 4 years and I've lost my sex drive.


My husband and I have been together going on 4 years. We have an almost 2 year old son and just got married in June. Most of my life I've had a low sex drive but once I met my husband things in that area where pretty normal. After having my baby it went downhill for a bit but then went back to normal. However lately I have just not been in the mood at all. For maybe 3 or 4 months now I can't seem to get into that mindset  (I can count on one hand how many times I was able to in that time period). I am on the kyleena IUD which I have been on for about a year and a half now, prior to that I was never on a hormonal birth control. I feel so bad, I don't know what to do. My husband is starting to make me feel guilty about it and I sort of don't blame him. Sometimes I'll just give in and give it a shot but then I find midway through that I'm starting to get angry or annoyed or upset. I really don't know where this came from or where to go from here.

TL;DR  I have no idea where my sex drive went or how to get it back. Husband is getting frustrated."
39,"I [30M] want to start getting back into a hobby after our two daughters have been born, but my wife [32F] isn’t supportive.


My wife and I have been married for 4 years and have a 2.5 year old and a 7 month old. I like to think I am good father and husband that values family above all else. I started a company from scratch that has provided us with a very comfortable life and the opportunity for my wife to stay home as her choice to raise the kids.

Despite owning a startup company, I make sure I am home by 430pm every day to help with the kids. I Never work the weekends or holidays. Being a present father to my girls is extremely important to me. Hell I can’t even remember the last time I saw any of my friends that don’t also have kids.

When my wife became pregnant my hobbies went out the window because she became extremely ill and at some points hospitalized. I had no free time because I was caring for her around the clock. Just as our first child was out of the baby phase, we got pregnant again and the illness process started over again. I got in the habit of making it to work super early so I could get home and relieve the babysitter at 3pm and take care of my sick wife and toddler daughter. Again, no time at all for my hobbies.

Now that my daughter is 7 months old, I want to start using my free time at night after the kids go down to have some me time. I am, or i guess was, a huge car guy and have a classic car restoration about 90% complete sitting in the garage.. I want to spend an hour or two a few nights a week working on it. Nothing major. Before marriage, I spent ALL of my free time out in the garage building cars so it’s been a huge sacrifice for me.

Well my wife is frankly not happy about it. From her perspective, she already feels like she doesn’t get enough time with me as it is and doesn’t feel like we are connecting which I agree with. However, I feel like I need this time to myself to do what I love. I want her to be happy and feel loved, but I also want my needs met. I don’t feel like i’m asking a lot. 

What should I do? What would be a good compromise here?"
40,"My (30F) sister (25F) bought a home she can't afford and has isolated herself, should I help her financially


My younger sister earns below the average salary and is on her own, she left a domestic violence situation last year, and has managed to purchase a house. Obviously we are happy for her and glad that she is safe and managed to do this by herself, it's impressive, however, she did not factor in the other costs of moving and her situation now is making me sad.

She purchased the house in July and moved in straight away, she was couch surfing prior to this. She had no furniture, she left it all when she left her abusive partner, she literally moved in with two suitcases. People were kind and gave her some random things but nothing crucial, I guess we all thought she would be okay. Didn't realise how bad the financial situation was. She used up almost all of her savings to get on the property ladder and didn't have anything left for any furniture. Her budget is also pretty tight and she has less than $400 per month left after budgeting for bills, savings, etc. So far she is sticking well within her budget which is great, but she's just not got enough left to buy furniture, appliances etc. It took her two months to buy a refrigerator. One older friend was going to give her a pair of couches but then they fell out, made up, yet the friend never mentioned her offer again, which has been tough as she feels she'd be able to entertain if people had somewhere to sit. 

We found out how bad things are because in August we tried to throw a housewarming party and she rejected the idea and got very angry and upset a lot of her friends, she didn't want anyone coming around because she had no furniture. Literally nothing. But she was too embarrassed to tell anyone. She is sleeping on the floor with a sheet and some pillows. She has no couch or anything to sit on. She has now managed to buy a refrigerator and a washer second hand. 

I guess life is hard, she is an adult and she committed to this but my heart is aching for her. Nobody has visited her yet except me, and she's become a bit isolated because she can't afford to go out but can't have any guests either. She has a history of depression and loneliness is probably the worst thing. I worry she is depressed again. I worry about what sleeping on the floor is doing to her physically. I worry that she isn't eating to try and save money, she was skinny to begin with and now it's worse I can feel her bones when I hug her.

I earn over three times what my sister does and can spare a little money. Would it be a good idea to offer her some financial help? Her situation would be manageable if she didn't have all these expensive furniture purchases hanging over her. I have floated this idea with our parents and they said absolutely not and they would be disappointed if I gave her money, it won't teach her anything. I feel that for someone who has been through what she has been through though that making her suffer is cruel. 

My parents are further damaging her self esteem by telling her that she needs to find a husband and that she will not be able to progress any further in life without joining finances with someone who earns 'real money'. While I think she would like to do this and probably will find a partner, I feel that telling someone who has been abused that they need a man to support them is a terrible idea.

Am I being soft or does someone need to help her? I think of all the times in my life that I couldn't have made it without help and this seems like my opportunity to make good. 

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR sister bought a house alone and is now broke, sleeping on the floor and not eating properly, has no furniture, I want to give her some financial assistance but parents said no, am I being soft?"
41,"My (33m) wife (31f) is making me feel horrible for seeking medical treatment


Obligatory throwaway account because I don’t want friends who know my reddit username to know what is going on. This will be a very long one because there are a lot of details that need to be put in here.

My wife and myself have been married for about 8 years, together for just under 10 years and we have had our ups and downs but most of the time things a good. However I was diagnosed with ADHD when I was 16 but haven’t been treated for it since I was 22 except for a brief time in 2012, for the past year or so I have been struggling at my job and with keeping up with all the projects around the house because I constantly jump between projects and can’t focus worth a damn. I tried talking to my wife about this prior to a yearly checkup at the doctor and she didn’t say much about it. I talked to my doctor and she agreed to start a treatment and laid out all of the costs for me, I decided to hold off on agreeing to the treatment until I could talk to my wife about the costs. When I talked to her she simply said “So you’re saying f that right?” I told her that I was leaning towards going ahead with it and she didn’t say anything after that. I finally agreed to the treatment plan, which contains a controlled substance so everything is monitored closely, I picked up the prescription on Friday but didn’t start taking them.

Everything seemed fine on Saturday morning, we were getting ready to go somewhere but when I was in the shower she asked for the passcode to my phone and I gave it to her, she ended up going through my messages and saw that I messaged my sister about ADHD (she has it as well) and I wanted to see if the regulations that my doctor said changed were true since some of them seemed odd, I didn’t think anything of it as she was going through my phone because I have nothing to hide from her but me messaging my sister about that set her off so I asked her what was up and she said that she shouldn’t say because it would make me mad. I asked her to tell me and then all hell broke loose about how I don’t need the damn drugs, that it’s going to ruin our lives and that I talk to my sister more than her (I rarely talk to her). There was more that was said that I don’t recall but we were both pretty worked up over it. We went ahead with our plans since we had an appointment for my oldest son. Things were tense during the day but it seemed like they got better as the day went on but once we were home she went back into her anger and said more things to me.

On Sunday morning she seemed fine and we went to do a family activity that took up most of the day, we got along just fine and had no issues until we got home and she just laid down on her chair outside and ignored the kids and myself, I finally convinced her to go on a walk with us because she’s been wanting to go on a walk in a particular area for a while. One thing that really bothered me was she accidentally hurt one of our kids (I know it was an accident as I saw it and I know she wouldn’t do anything to physically hurt our kids) but instead of seeing if he was ok she ran away in anger. During the walk tensions were high and she wanted nothing to do with me so I let her be and just tried to make sure the kids were enjoying the walk. When we got home we got the kids to bed and we sat down and watched TV together, eventually she cuddled next to me and I felt that maybe things were OK now however right after we stopped watching TV and she was getting ready for bed I got a text message asking me if I saw the note but I had no idea what she was talking about it. I got up and asked her about it but she was vague with where she had it but I finally found it and her ring was on top of it, the note basically said she doesn’t deserve the ring if she can’t support me when I need it. This angered me because I love her and I hate when she takes her ring off when she gets upset. I tried to give it back to her but she refused so I got angry and tossed it onto the kitchen counter and went back into the living room. She went to bed but I stayed up because I didn’t want to go to bed yet, I checked Facebook later to see a post that was set so only I could see it that said that she had a mix of emotions, anger, sadness, frustration, jealousy and disappointment in herself. It went on to say that she has a hard time changing herself and that was holding back from hurting herself. She was sleeping by the time I saw it so I couldn’t talk to her about it. There were other posts similar to this over the next couple days but this was the worst one.

Monday morning she had to work but seemed somewhat better beforehand but still didn’t want much to do with me. After she got home I made supper and then we all worked on cleaning the house. Towards the end she came up to me and gave me a huge hug, that lasted about 20 minutes, and cried quite a bit and apologized for how she treated me. We kissed a lot and after we put the kids to bed we had some really good sex, although she stopped during foreplay and cried a bit because how she treated me so I tried to comfort her but I thought it was because she felt remorse. We then got up and finished a few things around the house but I could tell that she was writing another note, which she ended up leaving in my lunch box.

I read the note in the morning as I got to work and it said that she was sorry for how she was this weekend and that it kills her how she treats me but that she’s thankful that I tolerate it and still love her as much as I do. I seriously thought things were done and back to normal, the first text I got from her on Tuesday morning was “Did you take your drugs?” instead of the normal good morning text. I should add that she always calls the prescription a drug for whatever reason. I answered that I did not yet but was going to in a bit, I was constantly asking her how the kids were since it was their first day of school but she wouldn’t answer that or how she was doing. Later we were texting and she was asking about the prescription but would drop little things like “it can’t be that important if it doesn’t last all day” “maybe you should just get a job with less thinking” “The evil selfish side of me doesn’t want the drugs to work so you won’t take them.” We also had a normal conversation in the middle of those random messages. I picked up the kids from school and when I got home I started making dinner, since my wife and myself have talked about how we have should have more family meals together, I messaged my wife to make sure that’s what she wanted but all I got was “make whatever you want.” I made the meal that was planned but when she didn’t come home 45 minutes after her scheduled shift I messaged her asking when she’d be home but she wouldn’t respond but eventually sent “I DK” so I told her supper would be done in 20 minutes if she thought she would be home and then I asked if she was still at work or somewhere else but she responded “doesn’t matter”. She finally showed up but didn’t want to eat so she took a shower and went to bed. I ate supper with the kids, cleaned up and then went to play with them for a while until bed time. I went by my wife to see what was going on and she said that she didn’t want to be around me when I would be on the drugs. She didn’t want to talk so I went to the living room and did my own thing for an hour before going to bed. I woke up in the middle of the night cold and saw that she was not in the bed but laying next to it with all of our blankets and comforter.

Now this morning the first text I get was “You don’t need to the god damn drugs, you were great before” “Our lives were good. Why make changes?” “I don’t want anything to do with you while you’re on drugs so I should stop texting your during the day. See you after 6 when you’re as normal as you can be”

I don’t know what to do, I don’t feel like she should be like this over me seeking treatment for a medical condition. I feel the worst that I’ve felt about myself in a long time but I’m trying my best to not let my kids see it as they need me the most right now. She was forced to go to counseling as a teenager and will refuse to go to any form of counseling as she sees it as a waste, this is what she has told me in the past during other blow ups like this.

TLDR: I have ADHD and haven’t been treated for many years, I am not getting treatment but my wife has completely turned on me and messed with my emotions."
42,"My (20F) abusive ex boyfriend (21M) showed up to my house uninvited over a year after breaking up - my mom was happy to see him.


Alright, this is a shit show so buckle up. 


I dated this guy for a year and a half, when I was in high school and a bit after I graduated. In the beginning it was nice - took me on dates, respected me, made me laugh and overall made me feel good. 


After about six months of dating, things began to fall downhill. He became disrespectful, especially to my parents. He would interrupt my mom frequently and never greeted my dad when he would come over. He started to resent my friends (guys and girls), and wanted to control who I was texting/when/why.  He was always looking over my shoulder to see what I was doing on my phone, and would get angry whenever I asked him why he always had to do that. A little after our six month anniversary I decided I needed to cut things off. He claimed I blindsided him and made me second guess my decision, so we tried again less than a week after being “broken up”. 


After this point it turned sexually abusive. Multiple times during the first six months of our relationship he brought up having sex, (I was a virgin), and was never pushy with it. After we had sex for the first time, he expected it of me and made me feel bad for not wanting to do it. When I didn’t want to have sex, he would try to talk me into it by putting my hand on his crotch and telling me “I know you want to”. Other times he would push my head down towards his penis and since we were in his car, it was hard for me to push away from him. It was evident I didn’t want to give him a blowjob, but he would keep doing it. 


There was also emotional abuse that occurred. He manipulated me into thinking I shouldn’t have any guy friends, that I was wasting my time pursuing a college education, and lied to me multiple times. Every conversation we had turned into a debate. I remember one time expressing to him that we weren’t communicating very well and he replied with “I’m busy”. I finally had enough and broke up with him for good - only to find out he had been cheating on me with an underclassmen at our shared high school. 


It got to the point where he was harassing me over text three months after the breakup, claiming I lied to him about why we broke up, calling me promiscuous, making fun of the guys I was friends with or casually dated. I had to block his phone number and his Snapchat. I also unfriended him on Facebook and Instagram. My mom knows this and why I did it. 


After we broke up I told my mom everything - besides the blowjob thing - and she kept in contact with him for months without me knowing. She sent him a card on his birthday this year and I found out by opening a letter addressed to my family from him, thanking us. I told her I did not appreciate this or feel comfortable with it, she understood and told me she would stop writing him/texting him once in awhile to see how he was doing. 


Fast forward over a year after the breakup - I’m in the greatest relationship of my life. My parents love my boyfriend, and so do I. More than anything. We’re planning on living together soon and are hoping to get married. 


A few weeks ago, my ex pulled into my driveway and acted like he was welcome in my home. I saw him get out of his car and I went into a panic attack, sobbing and almost throwing up. I just wanted him out of my life. My mom hugged him and talked with him for over an hour while I stayed inside crying on the phone with my current boyfriend. It took my dad to see me crying to get him to leave. I’m hurt that my mom was happy to see him, especially after knowing how terrible that relationship was. I guess I’m just asking for guidance, how should I approach this with my mom so she understands I don’t feel comfortable with her talking to him or him coming to my house? I thought we had established this already, but I guess we haven’t. I don’t know if I can trust her with this type of thing in my life in the future.


TL;DR abusive ex showed up to my house and my mom was happy to see him knowing that he abused me sexually and emotionally - asking for guidance on what to do"
43,"My (22f) best friend (22f)’s boyfriend (24m) said an inappropriate comment towards me


Thanks in advance, everybody! Throwaway for reasons. 

My (22f) best friend (22F) and I have known each other for years but only became very close the past two or three. She is incredible, talented, compassionate, and I’m so lucky to call her a friend. However, she struggles with anxiety and insecurity. 

Her boyfriend (23M) is her weak spot. He has ruined past friendships before (he called her former best friend a c**t twice straight to her face) and she always falls for his stupid lies and terrible excuses. 

They came over for Labor Day and hung out with me and my boyfriend (23M). When we entering my apartment, her boyfriend asked, “Has anybody ever told you that you have a nice butt?” Everybody faced him, shocked. My best friend asked if he was referring to MY boyfriend and he laughed and said yes. We all chuckled awkwardly. 

Then, after changing into bathing suits, he and I were ready before everybody else. I was fiddling on my phone and making small talk. Then he asked me if anybody has ever asked me to have phone sex with them. I said, “Not that I can recall, and I wouldn’t be interested in doing so.” My friend walked out next, and I told her what he had said, in front of him. She looked at him with disappointment and hurt but didn’t say anything. My boyfriend walked out shortly after. 

When I mentioned it to my boyfriend later, I was crying because it made me uncomfortable and I have dealt with some trauma with men in the (VERY recent) past. My boyfriend was very upset and said he will never leave me alone with my friend’s boyfriend again. 

This has been bothering me for days. I really don’t know if I should bring it up again to my friend or let it go. Am I overreacting? How should I handle this?

TL;DR: my (22F) best friend (22F)’s boyfriend (24M) said an inappropriate comment towards me"
44,"Boyfriend is highly critical, is this normal?


(24f) here, the guy is 26,one year relationship

 this is my first question in here, my boyfriend seems to rarely aprove of what i do, he thinks i should work out, my nose is too big, my breasts are too small, he doesn't like the way i walk,, myfashion sense , my movie/music taste, im not assertive enough, im not confident enough, i either talk too much or dont talk at all, he says i dont try ""enough"" when i do really try  then..im trying too hard, im being shallow.

it's honestly really bringing me down but he works out..he takes really good care of his appearence and he is a bit vain so am i overreacting ? whenever i bring it up with him if there is anything about me he actually does like, he brushes it off witha  joke or says my standards are just really high""

he never seems just happy or impressed with me, im always falling short in some way, we were friends before we dated and he said his ex is the only one who has really lived up to his standards, she is really pretty..much prettier than i will ever be...im starting to question my own achievments and self worth

TL;DR! Boyfriend is really critical of every little thing i do and im worried i will never be good enough"
45,"Me [31 M] with my friends [28-32 M/F] 5-20 years, I ruined my personal relationships during a time when I had a brain tumor. I am healthy now but the damage cant be undone. I don't know how to move forward given the things i've done.


I was diagnosed with a brain tumor in my frontal lobe about 3 years ago. For a good chunk of the year prior to my diagnoses I behaved in ways that resulted in almost everyone in my life cutting me off. I was vengeful, malicious, angry and just mean for no reason. I did not have a ton of friends but the 12 I had at the time were basically my family. I grew up in care so i had no actual family but I met most of my friends in college and we were very close. Over the course of about 9 months though, i managed to completely ruin all but one of those relationships to the point where everyone completely hated me.

For context of the type of person I became: I got kicked out of my friend's wedding (where i was a groomsman) after trying to sleep with his wife during the reception. Then because I felt that I was the one who was wronged (horrible, i know) I made a fake video of her 'cheating' and emailed it to his entire family a month later. And to top it off made some bots to spam her social media (she is a professional youtuber so this actually impacted her career) with claims that she was a cheater and worse.

And this is not the only horrible thing I did during this time.

It got to the point where no one in my life would have anything to do with me. I got fired from my job for my behavior. I got kicked out of my apartment. I was basically exiled because of who I had become. The the only person who stuck around did so because they knew me the longest (we were in a home together as kids and wound up going to the same college) and recognized how extremely out of character I was behaving. He eventually forced me to have a scan (not by choice of my own, but after i was hospitalized due to a fight I started) which revealed that i had a grade 2 tumor in my frontal lobe.

I was treated and am now fairly healthy again. Since being treated my personality has mostly returned to the person I was prior to having the tumor and my horrible behavior has subsided.

During the time I had the tumor, I did not recognize that my personality had changed and was not able to recognize just how horrible of a person I was being. I believed that I was in the right even when I did things that any normal person could see was completely wrong. I was honestly, a huge piece of shit.

Looking back at the things I did now I am able to see just how terrible I was. Since being diagnosed/treated I have tried to fix some of the damage I caused by my behavior but I am not sure I can. Most of my friends still hate me. Even though I have been told that the tumor likely impacted my personality during that time, they (understandably) cant separate the person I was during that time from the person I was before/am now. Most of my friends have been willing to meet with me to hear my apologies/ accept the things I have offered to try and make up for what I did to them but they still dont want to try and have a relationship with me again. They say damage was to bad to ever undo.

I know that I need to accept this and that they are right. If i were in their shoes i know i would feel the same way. I am trying to give them space and accept that there is a huge chance that none of these people will be willing to be in my life ever again but I am having a very hard time with that. I am also really struggling accepting the fact that, I was that type of person. The way i think now i cant believe that i was capable of that level of cruelty. I sometimes feel like i don't deserve to have another chance. Tumor or not at the end of the day, I am the one who did these things. The tumor may have impacted my self control but it didn't give me the ideas of what to do to begin with. I did that on my own.

I dont have anyone to speak with about this. My one friend keeps saying that it was the tumor and that i should just forgive myself and move forward. But i don't know how to do that. Should I should keep trying to repair my relationships or just accept that I burned them and can undo that? Any advice at all is appreciated.

TL;DR: a brain tumor reveled just how awful of a person I am. now that i no longer have the tumor, i dont know what to do"
46,"I [25f] am very uncomfortable with my husband's [33m] actions regarding sex last night and this morning, and I'm not sure what to do.


I'm struggling with alot of conflicting emotions over some things that went down last night and today with my husband [together 3 years, married for one] All help welcome.

For some background, things have been a little rocky between us for the last couple months or so. Its nothing serious, he has been having some trouble at work stressing him out, and when he gets stressed he gets very snappy and a little mean spirited. Its been causing alot of small fights.

Yesterday he was in a very foul mood over something at work. Even when he got home he was barking at me for this or that. It lead to a small fight and gave me a headache.

Because of the way he had been acting, I didnt really feel like having sex with him. We both have high libidos and we typically have it every night, but my head still hurt and I was still a little mad at him. He got in bed and started rolling into me and I just told him that I didnt feel like having sex. 

He got a little pissy and asked why not and I told him it was because of how he had treated me earlier I didnt want to have sex with him.

He got upset and told me Im still his wife. I asked him so what, and then he carried on ""We have sex every night!!"" While I just repeated that I didnt feel lkke it tonight. 
He eventually gave up in a huff and I started to roll over to go to sleep, but then I felt him start to pull down my underwear. I yelled at him to stop and he asked to have sex again. I told him to drop it.

He said he would but then like ten minutes later I felt him start pulling down my underwear again. I was worked into a pretth good rage by then so I told him I was going to sleep on the couch. He said something as I walked out but I didnt really hear it.

I slept on the couch. I got woken up this morning by my husband climbing on top of me. I got scared and asked what he was doing. I told him that nothing has changed since last night and he got angry again. He got mad and asked if I was going to send him to work today with no sex. I told him yes and he was frightening me with the way he was behaving. He told me he is only acting this way because I'm denying him his stress reliever (meaning, sex).

Before he left he told me that we *will* have sex tonight.

I dont like any of this. It is making me very uncomfortable what happened last night and makes me even more uncomfortable that he told me we are having sex tonight.

I do love my husband but I dont like these actions. What should I do ? And is it unreasonable to not want to have sex when youve been fighting?

**TL;DR**: Husband and I were fighting and I didnt want to have sex. He tried multiple times anyway last night and this morning and demanded I do it tonight. What do I do?"
47,"My (27F) boyfriend (32M) just called me and he ""misspoke"". I now think he's cheating on me.


Hi reddit, I'm at a bit of a loss at the moment for how to approach this so I need some advice. Tl;dr at the bottom.


My boyfriend, of almost a year, is off on a bachelor party for one of his good friends. It's a group of about 10 guys, and I know there is a lot of drinking and some drugs involved (neither of which I have a problem with). 


He called me tonight and I can tell he's a bit drunk and high, but he seemed upset and kept saying he wishes I was there with him. I thought it was cute, we just talked about random things and I tried to cheer him up. We got to talking about how the trip was going, he said it was good and started to tell me about this one guy. His exact words were ""Yeah there's this one guy who's pretty ugly, but managed to sleep with 3 girls last night. I only.."" he then stopped his sentence immediately and said ""oh nothing"". I asked what the end of that sentence was, and he just said oh it's nothing. That was the end. How he was speaking to me completely changed, I asked if anything happened last night. If he kissed anyone or was flirting with anyone. He just said I was so drunk, no way. I tried asking more questions but could tell it was going nowhere. 


I'm meant to see him tomorrow when he's back.. I'll of course be asking him about this so I can guage his reaction. I think I know he's hiding something from me, and I really have no way of knowing whether or not he is lying.. is there a way I should best approach this? Is there anyone who thinks it was just a simple he was high and drunk and said something stupid?


Tl;dr: boyfriend called me while he's away this weekend, he started a sentence which seemed to be heading in the direction that he had cheated. His attitude then changed completely. I think he cheated."
48,"Going to a coffee shop with my boyfriend |32M| irritates me |28F| so much because of the way he wants to be a performer and have the coffee shop as his audience.


TL;DR! Going to a coffee shop used to be one of my favorite activities, but now it feels sad, since my boyfriend wants to entertain the people around us.

Hi redditors,

Can I ask your help? I'm a city dweller and urbanite living in the heart of Los Angeles. Going out every day means being around a wide variety of interesting people. 

I used to love going to coffee shops and the energy of having so many cool creative people in one place. However, now I find it impossible to go without getting irritated. 

My boyfriend is a handsome guy, the kind of handsome that opens doors and has people go out of their way for no reason. He gets a lot of attention wherever we go. However, when we're out together, my attention isn't enough for him. When we're out at a coffee shop, he'll burst into song or talk in a foreign accent for minutes on end. It gets the attention of people around us, but what that looks like for me: he'll frequently not say anything when I'm trying to have a conversation with him, only to burst into song a minute later. Or he'll let me talk for a full minute, before responding in a foreign accent, completely minimizing whatever I just said. It makes me very unhappy, since I'm then placed as the audience for his show.

I'm concerned that his need for attention is interfering with my happiness. It leaves me in the awkward position of the girlfriend attached to this guy who wants an audience. What should I do? Should I be content being his audience?"
49,"I (32F) snooped on my friend’s (32F) phone and I found a conversation that broke my heart.


Let me begin by saying I know what I did was wrong and I feel like a rotten human being. 

I’ve just finished grad school and I’m in the process of figuring out what to do next. I visited friend X, who I consider one of my best friends. She is lovely, warm, very intelligent and driven, and I’ve admired her for her ability to be so many things at once. I’ve made the effort to be in her corner and have always checked in on her. She graduated from one of the best universities in the world and she did really well, and she tends to be self deprecatory quite often - whenever I’ve heard her downplaying her own achievements or capabilities, I’ve made sure to tell her that she is intelligent and capable and not to ever think otherwise. 

I have a friend Y, who is generally reserved and has been pulling away for some time now because she isn’t happy with her personal and professional life. I was a bit hurt but conversations with her weren’t yielding anything and i was sick of being the only person making the effort so I stopped trying to engage. I haven’t initiated contact with her in almost a year, waiting for her to figure things out and waiting for her to be comfortable with me again. 

Here is where I fucked up. I was using friend X’s phone and gave in to a frankly repulsive impulse to see what Y said about me to X (since they’re very close) when X was elsewhere for a few minutes. I searched for my name and what I found has upset me in a way that I can’t describe.

For starters, Y mocked me for trying to console her last year when she was rebuffed by a man she liked. My comments that she deserved to be with someone who made her happy, that I was glad that things ended before she made a larger commitment to him, and that this was far better than being in an unhappy marriage were mocked as being ‘hilarious’, and apparently I didn’t know how ridiculous it sounded. 

Second, apparently I was very insensitive in telling her that grad school was the best experience of my life (she went to grad school too, a different one), and Y told X that she had no interest in knowing how happy I was. To my shock, X said that I was insensitive and that I meant to be insensitive. At the time at which I made these statements, it was months after the person she liked turned her down and she had moved on to considering other men.

There were several other instances i saw in the 3-5 minutes I was looking at her phone - Y appeared to mock me when X said I didn’t get into a university that I’d really wanted (‘what is wrong with her?’), that I wanted to get a short term job in a city far away from my husband (‘does that even work?’ ‘What sort of marriage is this?’) I was hurt when I saw a message from X insinuating that I was lying when I said the effects of a particular brain injury lasted weeks - X thought it lasted hours and did independent research to verify what I said. I also saw messages from X about how she was so fucking bored during a lunch with me and a friend I’d invited.

I am crushed. They were both really close to me and I felt like this was a safe space - it now feels like they’re ok either talking shit about me or not saying anything when there’s an unkind comment, and it makes me feel really shitty. I have never done this and feel sick. This also seems like they grudge me my happiness - am I not supposed to be happy in my marriage and my professional life? Why would they talk like this? Is this how adult friendships are? Am I expecting too much? I don’t know how to deal with this and feel like I want to shut down and not talk to humans. Please help me. 

TLDR - I snooped and found several unkind messages about me in a conversation between one of my closest friends and another person and I am shocked and deeply hurt."
50,"I (19f) have a crush on my roommate (20f). I can't figure out if she actually likes me back or not or is just being friendly. Help.


I've lived with my roommate for over a year now. We met in high school (a few classes) but we were never really friends. We worked on some projects together and that's it. I never really paid attention to her but she is SMOKING hot and I obviously knew she was and acknowledged it. We ended up going to the same college together though and decided since we know each other we should room together. She's a v lovely roommate but I've ended up developing a pretty huge crush on her after I started being in her company a lot (I'm a lesbian. I'm fully out. My roommate knows this). The problem is, I can't figure out if she's flirting with me or not. Please help me. I'll list some instances from the past year in no order that have stood out to me.

1. She said that we should make a list of each other's fave orders from a bunch of places so if we need to order for the other we can. I said sure that's good. Over the past few months, when I had a lot of things due and my anxiety was acting up, she kept paying for my fave order meals (usually we split money) and getting me them with very cute cards telling me good luck and stuff. When I tried to do it back she said ""no, let me take care of you"" and my small gay self collapsed.
2. Her baby niece came to visit once with her sister and she referred to me as ""auntie's very special girl friend"". I freaked but just laughed it off.
3. She gets me anything I say in passing I want or circle in any catalogue that I have. We don't have a lot of money but she keeps doing it because she says she wants me to be happy so I started doing it and now we're both kind of broke but have some sort of present buying stand off going on even currently.
4. She said I smell very very nice and hugged me once at home and didn't let go for a while, saying I smell like home and all things nice. When we split for the summer in the past few months, she texted me saying she misses the way I feel and smell with no regard for my gay heart. I said you smell nice too and she laughed about it. I never know how to respond.
5. She once held my hand while we were walking outside and she wanted to pull me along. She didn't let go until she had to, and since then whenever we go out, she holds my hand. I don't know if it's platonic.
6. I once fell asleep on my work and I woke up with my head in her lap and she was watching her laptop and stroking my hair and I almost had a stroke. She said I looked peaceful so she didn't wake me. She also cuddled me when I was upset about a bad quiz grade and held me until I felt better.
7. While drunk, she looked at me and said that I looked like I wanted to kiss her and when I panicked she was like ""I won't mind"" but she was very very wasted and she forgot about it I think so I never brought it up.
8. She referred to me by my name for a few months, but now she almost exclusively calls me ""baby"". She asked me if it was okay and I was like yeah go for it and she was like thanks because I always refer to my friends like this. But SHE DOESNT. I've never heard her call anyone else baby. She also occasionally says ""baby girl"" and ""cutie"".
9. She said to me ""why do you look so beautiful without trying"" after I had rolled out of bed. I don't know what she meant.
10. She was sick a few months ago so I took care of her and she called me her ""little nurse angel"" and held my hand while sleeping, but she was so sick I don't think it counted.
11. She regularly sends me things that I like (fandoms she's not even in) or random posts and says ""thinking about you"" or ""reminded me of you"". She's also gotten into many of my interests, as i have into her interests. Now we're saving up for a convention based on a joint interest.
12. Past Valentines day this year, she texted me saying ""You're my valentine"" (as a joke?) and I said okay you're mine. She then gave me a stuffed animal, I had to scramble to buy her chocolates and then we went to go eat at my favourite takeout place. A guy also gave me a chocolate (we're friends) while she was with me and she said ""don't steal my valentine now"".
13. We weren't close for her first birthday freshly after we became roommates. We were closer for my birthday and she gave me a VERY expensive gift after working over time at shifts and she said ""you deserve the best"". Her birthday has JUST passed and I went all out, got her cake and presents and we went out to eat at her favourite place. She hugged me very very tight after and said that i make her happy.
14. She also regularly says ""okay! it's a date"" every time we make plans but that's a fairly common thing to say so I don't know if she means it literally.
15. This doesn't count but she looks at me very intensely sometimes. I don't know how to describe it but it doesn't look very platonic. But maybe she just does that to everyone so I don't know. She's a very intense person in general I think.

This is all I can think of right now. If I'm forgetting anything, I'll probably edit this post. My friends think she definitely likes me and think I'm being stupid and oblivious on purpose. I just think she's straight and doing this out of friendliness so my friend asked me to post here and get a general consensus. She had a boyfriend in high school briefly and I'm afraid to ask her sexuality. I don't want to be let down but I want her to like me SO BAD, and I keep avoiding her sometimes and her friendliness because I don't want false hope. I know I probably sound stupid and in denial but I suffer from bad anxiety and I can't just go up and ask her unless I'm sure. I don't want to lose her. Please help.

Tl/dr: I am gay and my roommate keeps doing things that are toeing the line between being romantic and platonic. I don't know what she means. Advice needed"
51,"My [31M] wife [34F] fights unfairly and I'm starting to resent her


My wife and me have been married almost two years. We have our good days but we generally quarrel over small things. E.g. she wants to order food on my phone and I'm clicking too fast. E.g. she's busy and not responding while I'm asking her something. Things like that. But often these quarrels turn into bigger things.  

She uses ""always"" and ""never"" a lot, e.g. ""You never listen"", or ""You always do whatever you want."" In her rage, she has yelled at least ten times that we are incompatible and that she wants a divorce. Or ""I'm older than you, I have more life experience"". But the worst she has used is ""I've been in more relationships than you, I know what a good relationship is"". It makes me feel insecure. (I've had only two girlfriends before her, she may have had 10 or 15 guys before me.)  

After her rage subsides, she'll say sorry but one week later she'll say something mean again. I'm really starting to resent her, and it creates a vicious circle. I don't want kids with her or talk about relocating (something she wants) as long as she casually screams divorce every month.  But this in turn fuels her anger more.  

To be clear, when we fight, I'm always very calm. I've never said anything like this and have never asked for a divorce. I'm committed to make this marriage work but I'm starting to lose faith.

TL:DR: In her anger, wife screamed for divorce many times, says things that hurt."
52,"Am I (20M, 21 next month) being inconsiderate by saying I'm sick of my mother tracking me on an app 24/7?


First  off, a big fuck you to whoever came up with Life360. That shit does  nothing but ruin relationships between parents, kids, significant  others, etc. because that shows there's no trust.

Anyway,  when I turned 18 my mother made me install the bullshit on my phone. I   let her know I was strongly against it, but she insisted she just  wanted  to make sure I was safe, sure whatever.

Over  the past 2 years, she hasn't forced me to go/stay anywhere nor has she   given any consequences for where I've been. HOWEVER, she constantly  asks  me why I am where I am, especially if she didn't know I was going  to be  there. And it's really starting to eat me up.

I'm   in my 3rd year of college, have a good part-time job and pay for most   (if not all) of my portion of the phone bill. I clearly have things   going for me and I definitely don't need to be babied anymore.

She throws a fit if I ever turn off my location which is why I don't do that anymore. It starts a lot of unwanted shit for me.

I'm  honestly not sure what she would do now if turned off my  location/deleted the app, not much she can do but throw a fit and scream  at me.

Both my 18 year old  brother and I are going through this. My brother lives on campus, so  what business does my mom have knowing he's there anyway? I can tell  both he and I are just sick of it.

So I guess my questions are:

1. Am I an asshole for wanting independence and not watched all day everyday?
2. If not, how should I politely let my mother know this upsets me without 'stirring the pot'?

TL;DR  my mother has been tracking me on Life360 for 2 years, I'm almost 21.  I'm wondering if I'm shitty for disagreeing with it and how to go about  explaining to my mother that I don't like it."
53,"Learned my boyfriend's Dad is telling him ridiculous things about me that aren't true


I (25F) have been with my boyfriend (25M) for almost a year. We both live with our families right now, but we are actively looking for an apartment to move in together. This will be the first time either of us are out of the house.

Yesterday when my boyfriend and I were spending time together, he was angry at his Dad. We talked about some of the issues, then he dropped a bomb on me.

This entire time I thought his Dad and Step-mom liked me. They are very nice to my face and invite me to every family event. They have even invited me places when my boyfriend was working and I had the day off.

I have always been on my best behaviour with his family and they have zero reason to dislike me. 

Now he is telling me the entire time we have been dating, his Dad has encouraged him to break up with me because I am bisexual and therefore might cheat on him, and because I work retail right now. Obviously I'm really hurt by this. 

Part of me is telling myself to just ignore it, I am dating their son, not them. But my boyfriend and I are talking about the future already, with us moving in together before we get engaged. We aren't going to rush a wedding, but I do see myself marrying him and starting a family.

Is this always going to be an issue? What if we have kids? This is their grandparents, I dont want them trying to poison people against me when I have done nothing wrong. 

Do I talk to my boyfriend's parents about this? Do I ignore it? How am I supposed to react, I have never had a partner's parents hate me before.

TL;DR: boyfriend's parents are trying to get him to break up with me because I am bi and work retail. Dont know how to react."
54,"I [23 M] really don't lime my Girlfriend [24 F] of 1 year's habit of going barefoot in public. Am I being petty?


I [23 M] been dating my girlfriend [24 F] for about a year, and I really like her for the most part. She just has this one thing that I can't really get over. She goes barefoot EVERYWHERE. In stores, malls, movie theaters, restaurants, even the doctors office! She's actually gotten thrown out of a few places because of the no shoes no service policies, but she just makes a point not to go to those places that won't let her in with barefeet.

She says she does it because she hates shoes and that going barefoot is actually healthier. I don't like it because I thinks its gross (Her soles are jet black most of the time, all though shes does always wash them when she gets home) and I don't really like the attention she attracts when I'm with her. Everyone staring at the weird lady with no shows on. I admit I have social anxiety.

I've gently asked her to wear shoes but she refuses. Am I being silly? Or am I in the right when I think going barefoot in public is gross and weird?

TL;DR GF goes barefoot in public, I think its weird and gross."
55,"My [26F] boyfriend [28M] doesn't like that I visit afterwork events, and calls my entire career immature


 I work in game development. In a relatively large, popular, professional game company. However, usually in gaming companies, things are very relaxed, familiar, and the rules are much less strict than in perhaps many other workplaces - perhaps also because the employees tend to be pretty young. Which is something I specifically enjoy about it.

&amp;#x200B;

Well my BF of 5 years has increasing problems with it. I worked in a game company when we met and it didn't seem like a problem at first. Later I left that company and started to work in 'normal' software development, which he seemed glad about and commented on how I am finally doing a 'serious, respectable' job now. It seemed half like a joke but rubbed me the wrong way, but I didn't say anything.

&amp;#x200B;

So it turned out that I really really didn't like that job, specifically because it was so boring and people were grumpy and never talked to each other. And after 3 more years I recently finally managed to get back into game development and am really happy again. However again it comes with an environment that offers many afterwork activities, team events, etc with pretty young coworkers. It is mainly one evening in the week where I stay at work and there's something like karaoke or a 'pub quiz' or something like that happening, plus a few big company parties throughout the year. It does also usually include alcohol, I won't lie. I realise this would be bizarre in other companies but here it's just quite normal. I  personally make sure to not go beyond 'slightly tipsy' most of the time. I probably also won't go every time forever, but since I just started there it's a great way to get to know more people and my team especially.

&amp;#x200B;

He doesn't like it, and has commented on how unprofessional my company must be, and the whole game business in general, and how immature it is to get drunk with your coworkers afterwards. He says he doesn't understand how I can sing karaoke and drink beers with a team lead for example. I think it's great that this is possible, and so far it has worked out just fine. He has even said this will damage my career if I ever move on to something more 'professional'. However I've made it pretty clear that I aim to stay in game development and if that isn't possible then at least I would always aim for something creative and laid-back.

 I should clarify that he hasn't ever said he thinks I could cheat, and I never would, but I think maybe that's the issue behind his dislike? I have also thought that maybe he could be a bit jealous, because his job is way more formal and strict. Idk. Maybe it's just a difference of our viewpoints. I've always been more laid back and fun-oriented than him. But now it is really starting to become an issue.

56,"SO lied about my name being on the lease


TLDR at the bottom

Today I found out my SO (M31) lied about my name being on the lease. We moved into our new house at the end of April. I wasn't really psyched about the house for many reasons, but I signed the paperwork and paid half of the deposit plus half of first months rent. Have been paying HALF of all bills and utilities since.

Today he let it slip that I wasn't on the lease....? Excuse the fuck out me?!? I signed the paperwork I know I'm not crazy. Well, it turns out, he told the landlord, which is also his boss, he lost the lease and needed a new one. He only signed his name because he had to protect himself in case s omethijg went wrong.

TLDR; My SO other thew away the lease agreement we both signed on purpose and signed a new one with just his name for his own reasons."
57,"I (18F) can't get along with my mother's (54F) boyfriend (52M) who have been dating for well over a year and it's ruining their relationship


 My mom met a guy when she joined a band as their singer and after a while they started dating.

They dated for some time, but it all went wrong when after visiting us he  got angry (can't remember what it was about), left and later told my mom to come outside to talk about it. I immediately felt something was  wrong so I kept an eye on her. Eventually she came back inside, told me he was furious and demanded all sorts of thing from her, including  paying back money that he kept sending her even though she refused. She  then told me she would go out to talk to him again and told me to keep watch and call the police if anything went wrong. He apparently locked  the car door when she got in and was absolutely furious... He kept yelling so hard that I could hear it from where I was standing, told her he'd love to see her hang herself from the crane that was at the mall in front of our house and told her that I should watch her. He told  various other horrible things. I was so afraid at the time and sat in front of our house on the curb to keep watch. When she eventually came back, which was around 2:30AM, she was in shock and really scared.

The next day we had to close all the windows and put this screen in front  of the window in the living room cause he said he would smash it in. Me, my brother and my mother then went to the police to file a report.

Even more weird things happend including him sending my grandma messages  about how much he loved my mother and he even sent her a self made collage of my mom's selfies that my mom sent to him. Everyone was freaked out cause this dude was legitimately being insane and **really** creepy. After a while he apologized for what he did and after very long  conversations they've had my mother apparently forgave him and  eventually they continued dating again. To be honest me and my brother could not understand why she would do that, but apparently she was okay with it

He moved in with us very quickly and since that moment I have not felt safe and at peace in my own house. In the beginning I ignored my discomfort and tried so hard to get along with him because it made her happy, but I just didn't feel at ease... He would get mad very often and then they would fight until  the middle of the night and I'd hear him yell so loud.

Eventually I had reached a point where I was so unhappy and felt so unsafe that even they noticed and my mom brought it up during dinner. I broke down  and explained I couldn't accept their relationship because I thought he was a dangerous man and I told them that I felt unsafe in my own house.  Of course he didn't really take that well...

Nothing  changed after that conversation and it kinda turned into a game of ""how  long would it take for him to get extremely angry again"".

After another fight my mom told me that she found out that he lived with his ex wife for a very long time and that he had lied about that, since he had said that he had nothing to do with her anymore.

Besides lying so many times to the point that my mom doubts everything he says  and doing extremely weird things he also checked her phone to see who  she is texting, is extremely possessive and accuses her of cheating on him all the time and doesn't want her to go out with friends or talk to other men, hates my father and accuses her of still being in love with  him (which is absolutely not true lmao), hates that apparently ""all conversations are about my father"", which also isn't true, but my mom now doesn't allow me to talk about my father because of this, he never helps out around the house, is pretty aggressive with our dog and told me that his previous dog wouldn't walk on a leash so he lifted him up  with his leash, effectively choking him, until his tong turned blue he then let him go and the dog walked on the leash ever since. My mom  brought it up with him and she told me that he said that he made that  story up, but I honestly wouldn't be suprised if it was true. Besides all this he is also racist, homophobic and Islamophobic.

But one of the worst things for me is that he lies about me to my mother and what's even worse is that she believes him. I'm now being blamed by  my mother for ruining their relationship when I don't see any way how I  could get along with him. Yesterday my mother even admitted driving the long route home to avoid everything, said she wants to pack her bags and leave and she tried to make me feel incredibly guilty about all of  this.

At this point me and her boyfriend have been sorta avoiding and ignoring each other for months, but apparently he still complains and lies about me to my mother on a daily basis and she believes it or at least partly believes it which is  straining my relationship with her even further (our relationship was never good since she's always been abusive but that's a story for another day). My mom keeps telling me to interact with him and she's telling him the same thing, but we have nothing to talk about. My whole family is well educated and loves to have good conversations or debates, but he went to the high school with the lowest difficulty while me and my brother went to the highest (in the netherlands high schools have  different difficulties). I deffinitely do not have a problem with that, but his views are very limited because of it and we also communicate and  think differrent because of it.

We only say ""hello"" and ""goobye"" to each other and sometimes he makes  shady/meanful comment towards me or my mother. The rest of the time he just looks at me with an angry face. Even during dinner he is completely silent and as soon as he's done and I'm still eating (I'm 99% of the  time the last one to finish) he goes outside to smoke, which I think is a tiny but rude, but okay.

I really don't know what to do anymore. I never had any problem getting along with her other boyfriends, and there have been **a lot** of different ones, but I really cannot stand this man. I have given him so many chances that I just don't think it's worth it anymore and I kinda don't even want to get along with him anymore.

Is there anything else I can do? I have no ideas anymore how to improve this situation anymore and I feel like all of this is hopeless.

**TL;DR:**  Can't get along with my mother's boyfriend, who has locked her in his car at the beginning of their relationship, threatened her before and is very questionable in general, and it's ruining their relationship"
58,"Husbands [31m] ex girlfriend [39?f] keeps inserting herself into things with his family and I need a reality check please.


So obligatory back story here- husband dated ex for 6 years, she was not a great person but put on a great show etc. His family and her were off and on close during their relationship but not so much towards the end. 

I’m almost 30 years old and I’m so embarrassed and ashamed this is even an issue for me, so I’m hoping someone here can offer some insight.  Since my husband and I got together, she has seemingly overnight amped up her Facebook contact with my husbands family. She will like everything, comment how much she misses people in his family on their posts, and in general just be a dominant presence on things Facebook related. In addition, his family loves to make fun of my husband about her ALL THE TIME. I’m talking every time we are all together they’ll make little jokes or reference her (usually negatively or poking fun at him) and recently this went on for an entire night. 

 At that point I said something about how I felt really uncomfortable about this and it seems like they are stuck in the past and cannot recognize we are a thing now. And it’s strange to me because I’d never mention someone’s ex repeatedly with lots of intricate details to their new wife because it would feel I don’t know, awkward? Strange? Disrespectful? I don’t know. 

 Where I’m struggling is how to move forward. I recognize this is a me problem and I’m in control of how I feel. And when I brought this up to my husband he basically asked what I’d like him to do about it and I said whatever you think would solve this problem. And nothing really was done. 

 This is strange for me because I’m not a jealous or insecure person normally, and consider myself very open. But this has been a very long time of continuously hearing about his ex over and over and seeing her all over Facebook. 

 Can anyone please help me get out of my head about this? Or has anyone ever experienced something similar? What did you do and what was the outcome? 

Tldr; husbands ex is still a massive thorn in my side and I don’t know how to cope."
59,"I (31F) feel stuck because husband (31M) doesn't want to put in effort. Is it time to leave?


My husband and I have been together for 10 years, 5 of them married. When we got married, I knew I was going to be the trailing spouse. My husband has to go where the job is and doesn't have much choice. I signed up for that 5 years ago. Okay.

I am optimistic, positive, and try to find the good things about new places. Each place is unique and has its own things to offer.

In July, we moved cross-country to a new location after being in a place that I deeply loved for 3 years. If I'm honest with myself, I dislike this new place after trying to think of the positives. It's isolated (3 hours from nearest medium city), is one giant strip mall, zero walkability, no green spaces, too hot to enjoy a day outdoors for about half the year, few medical resources, food scene is not up my alley, insular community that I don’t identify with, low-quality services (internet, massage, therapist, car insurance, etc.) due to being isolated and not having to improve to be more competitive, etc.

With the move, I also took a pay cut in a new job I'm not excited about. There is a near-zero chance to get a better job and grow my career (important to me) because there are very few professional jobs here in my field. In slightly bigger cities, I’d have lots of job opportunities.

On to the actual relationship...Our communication has been awful for at least the past year. I've tried being as articulate as possible and telling him how I feel. Here are my issues with the marriage:

-I feel taken for granted and unappreciated. He hasn't taken steps to make the last 2 cross-country moves any easier. I've dealt with 90% of the logistical stress from each move because he ""can't take time off work to help"" and ""hasn't thought about planning."" Other than 1 time, he's never done anything special for our anniversary (dating or wedding) or my birthday other than ""oops, I didn't plan anything. Let's go to our favorite restaurant."" This is despite me explicitly saying to him that I would enjoy it a lot if he were to plan something to make it a special occasion (not expensive or lavish). I'd planned stuff for our anniversary and his birthday for years but recently stopped doing that because I didn't feel like the effort was returned or appreciated.

-Related to above, I manage all finances and paperwork (investing, retirement, taxes, insurance, etc.). When I need his cooperation (like getting me a certain document), it usually takes him ages, if ever. He’s not interested in managing his money “as long as he has enough to eat and live.”

-He’s the youngest of 5 kids, and I clearly see that he got used to having other people (mom, older siblings) handle stuff for him and for themselves without effort on his part. This translates to him being very laissez faire and hands-off. For a while, I confused this behavior with him being supportive/giving me the freedom to do what I want. Now, I see that it’s prevented him from looking at our relationship as a team effort and more like 2 individuals driving side-by-side. He would also rather walk away from a conversation or make jokes to insert humor than to actually talk through issues and take action.

-I’ve suggested marriage counseling. Since I’m always the one who plans things, I explicitly asked him to be the one to find a counselor. That would be him showing that he’s making an effort and not just letting me do all the work. It’s been months since I’ve brought this up. We’ve talked about it several times since, but he still hasn’t scheduled anything. (We’ve had plenty of time after the move.)

-We haven’t had sex in 5 years. I understand I’ve gained weight and might not be as attractive. Turn all the lights off. Stop bringing home trash food. Exercise with me. I’m only 31 and can’t see myself abstaining from sex forever. (I'm just giving examples of how he could be supportive. I'm not blaming him for the weight gain.)

SOOOO Do you have any suggestions to save my marriage? How bad is it that I’ve been thinking about an exit plan? With a roommate-level marriage, disliking the living location, and not having career prospects, should I make more effort to stay? Am I being selfish? There are many things I love about him, but I’m not sure right now that they outweigh the unhappiness.

TL;DR Together for 10, married for 5. I’m the trailing spouse. Recently moved to new location that I don’t like, with no career mobility for me. Marriage has issues that non-team-player husband doesn’t want to make effort towards resolving. No sex for 5 years. Should I move on?"
60,"How do I (24M) best go about telling my mom (60F) that I do not accept her apology and I want to distance our relationship?


About 2 weeks ago, my mom and I got into a really big fight over something she really blew out of proportion.

I went to a baseball game with my dad and older brother, but did not extend an invitation to my half brother. The game was a monday afternoon so I just didn't invite him because he was going to be at school. Not because I didn't want him to come.

This ended with her exploding at me because I didn't treat him like he was a part of our family. She thought I didn't invite him because I didn't want him to come or some stupid bullshit like that.

Anyway, we had a huge argument and then I just hung up on her.

I texted my younger brother and told him to ""mom might be upset when you get home so just he ready..."" because she has a tendency to lash out at anyone and everyone when an argument arises.

Anyways, my younger brother decided to tell my mom that I essentially was talking bad about her behind her back and then she left me a pretty horrible voicemail on my phone and I did not contact her for over 2 weeks until today.

On her voicemail she said a bunch of horrible shit. The most stinging thing being *""...and wow. You went to college for five years to get a pre med and psychology degree? Well you really should have thought that through because you are a fucked up, emotionally unavailable, selfish narcissist.""*

This is all while on the phone saying how shitty I am as a son and brother and then saying I dont care if we never talk again. I'm tired of putting up with bullshit from my kids.

for context, my whole life with her has been pretty shitty. My dad cheated on her when I was born and it caused a huge divorce and rift in the family. She was always emotionally distant and cold my whole childhood. I always tried my hardest throughout my life to be a good son to her because I knew she was hurting and was not trying to hold anything against her
I call her every single day and ask how she is doing and how her day went.

I intentionally took a zero on a massive midterm in genetics so I could be with her in the hospital when she was getting surgery for ovarian cancer.

I always let her vent her frustrations out on me and listen to her when she needs an ear to listen. But after she left me a nearly 10 minute voicemail berating me and saying all those horrible things I can't really justify being in a relationship with her anymore. Someone that thinks that negatively of me does not need to be in my life.

This morning, after two weeks, she finally called me to apologize and saying she has spent two weeks regretting what she said to me the second she hung up the phone. She was saying ""I dont know why I feel the need to lash out at people like that. I am so disgusted about what I said to my own son that I can't even sleep."" Etc etc.

I told her that I need a few days before we talk again.

I do not accept her apology though. This has been a recurring cycle throughout my entire life. It's a cycle where she was say really horrible shit to me out of anger and frustration and then she apologizes and I accept said apology. Then we move on. I can't, for my own mental wellbeing, accept this apology. To me it just gives her the okay to say that shit to me because I'll just accept the apology and move on.

 I was extremely affected, saddened, and depressed by the things she said to me in that voicemail. If I just accept her apology my feelings toward what she said will be invalidated. 

I also wish to distance my relationship with her. But I'm stuck with this because I know she struggles with mental health and I always seemed to be the person that was around to help her through it, but she does not seem to realize that.

I'm scared to do this because I dont know how it will truly affect her knowing i wish to distance and possibly cut ties with her.

I still love her with all my heart, but I cannot do this to myself anymore. Help me. How do I navigate this?

TLDR- mom overreacted to a dumb situation and then left me an extremely toxic and vitriolic voicemail 2 weeks ago that really affected me. I did not speak to her for two weeks until she called to apologize to me this morning. I dont accept her apology and wish to distance myself from her, but I am scared to do this because she struggles with mental health and I still love her."
61,"My (29F) Husband (32M) went from being completely sober before marriage, to a massive stoner 8 months after marrying


I don’t know how to handle this situation and feel completely lost on what to do. My husband (32M) was completely sober for about 5 years before we got married. We had been together for 3 of those years. He had a bad drinking problem before becoming sober so I knew he was a recovering addict. He would often joke about when he is old and retired that he would just be an old man smoking weed, but said he had no desire to smoke until then. I never put any thought into it. 
About 6 months after we got married he starting talking about how he wanted to start smoking weed again. I was really against it because I knew that it would go from 0-60 overnight and he would be smoking all the time if he started. I urged him to please talk to his AA sponsor to talk to someone else that understands addiction but he wouldn’t and started smoking anyways and promised it would only be a once in a while thing. 
Well just as I thought he pretty much started smoking everyday after he started. His tolerance keeps getting higher too so he needs more and more to try to chase that high. He is high always now. He’s flat out told me that he’ll never give up weed. He spends hundreds of dollars on it a month and has no extra money to help out with anything. It’s been just over a year since he started smoking again and it’s really damaging our marriage. His family comes second to weed at this point. All he cares about is making sure he is able to get high.
I don’t know how much more I can handle of this I’m reaching my breaking point. Any sort of input would be greatly appreciated. Thanks 

TL;DR! - My husband went from being completely sober before marrying to a heavy weed smoker 8 months after marriage. He spends hundreds a month on weed and chooses making sure he can get that high over his family."
62,"My [28/M] husband and I [27 F], together for 6 years, have been a little distant. Tonight I heard him masturbate for hours non stop while pretending to be asleep and now I feel terrible.


 My husband (28M) and I (27F) have been together for 6 years. Since we moved to the new apartment we have been a little distant, we don’t kiss anymore, and sex happens less often, and he has been playing in his PC until 4 in the morning almost every day... A few weeks back I took initiative and started to be more affectionate and initiate things. It was going great, he even started to spend more time with me and less time gaming. But a few days in, he started to cut me off asking why I wanted sex two times a day all of a sudden, I was ashamed and stopped for a bit. Tonight, when he came to bed 4AM I was awake but pretended to be asleep, and then he started to masturbate. I was mortified because I think masturbation is quite personal and I didn’t want to embarrass him, so I continued to pretend to be asleep. Then it was over, I relaxed and tried to sleep. But then he started again, then it was over, and he started again, and I was in bed until 7AM (time I needed to wake up) hearing he masturbate and pretending to be asleep. I don’t know if this has been going on every time he goes to bed late, but I suspect it is. And now I´m a little bit freaked out, does this mean that he only doesn’t want sex with me? Should I say something? Our relationship was always very good, he is my best friend and I am worried that something is missing or I should be doing more for our relationship then I am now.  (Sorry for mistakes English is not first language).  

TL;DR: My husband has been masturbating a lot every night but doesn’t appear to want sex with me, what should I do?"

i just finished unpacking all my stuff/organizing my room, and this academic year is shaping up to be a good one, i think. on va voir!

64,"My (31F) ex (31M) denies his parents access to our kids. They ask me for help in seeing them.


My ex is a very difficult, angry person. He has a paranoid streak and is very suspicious of basically everyone he meets, including his parents and myself. I left him a year ago, we have two kids. When we were together I always had a good relationship with my in laws and we visited them once a week. Now that we've divorced my ex does not want the kids around his parents anymore. I don't know what exactly the issue is now, but he always had issues with them (how much TV they let the kids watch, the kind of food they offered etc). I have no problem with these things. 

They've asked me if they could see their grandkids on the days I have them. My kids miss them. This would be a no-brainer, except - my ex is a very, very difficult person. If he found I went behind his back (which he almost certainly will), he will be very angry. I have to deal with him once in a while obviously, and I am sort of dependent on him in that I have no family here and if I have an emergency and need someone to watch the kids for me, he is the only person I can turn to. I'm also glad he finally stopped sending me abusive messages.

Any advice? Can I justify going behind his back? I feel like the kids are the losers here, but to be honest I'm afraid of his anger.

TL;DR Ex is a very angry person who denies his parents access to our kids. I've always had a good relationship with them and they asked me to visit them with the kids. The kids miss them, but I'm a bit afraid of my ex. Help?"
65,"Friend (18) thinks he’s being abused because parents give him basic household work


So I know this guy for five years, and he was always kinda different, but nice. He always reminds  me of my past (like he is just like me, when I was 12) and it seems like he doesn’t understand the reality yet. But more to that later

His parents are the usual German parents you would expect from a German TV show but sometimes he’s texting me “Jesus Christ I have to empty the dishwasher, i fucking hate my parents” or today “I have to run the errands....”

And he writes that always in a way where he wants to point out that he’s being abused. (It’s seriously just the usual housework) and I don’t know what to do, when I try to talk with him he doesn’t acknowledge me at all and say stuff like

“Yeah maybe it’s normal for you, but not for me”

Now he wants to talk with the CPS because of that and he wants to drop his great apprenticeship (last year before finishing it) and wants to move out with another apprenticeship (you can’t live on your own with 600$ a month here) 

He thinks that everything is so easy in life (like me, when I was 12)

I’m trying my best, but I can’t encourage him to do that but it’s also impossible to talk with him

 I feel like he’s seeing me more and more as his enemy 

And i feel like a terrible friend, but I have no idea what to do anymore, it can’t go on like this

Two days ago he told me I had to leave on Friday because the video game was coming out (I spend the night a lot 3-4 days at a time).
I was fine with that because I go to my hometown Friday-Sunday once a month and leave Friday morning or afternoon if I’m at his place. 

Wednesday I hung out with my bff and Thursday afternoon I took a test and texted my boyfriend asking if he wanted to hang and he says “sure.”
I  get to his place and he’s watching espn AND then he turns on his PS4 and begins to play battlefield with his friend. I’m tired so I go to his bedroom and fall asleep. 

I wake up and he comes in his room around 8 p.m. and says “you need to leave at 12 a.m and I’m going to the dollar store.” I’m like okay I’ll just leave now and I can drive to my hometown and it’ll be a 1 hr 40 minute drive. He told me i was being extra and could stay until 12. He goes to the store but I leave and go down to my car to put my bags away.  

He texted me “wow” “smh” when he realized I’d left. After a few minutes of wow smhs i realized i left my Apple Watch on his counter and asked if he could bring it down, his response was “Nah dude that’s a whole trip” “I love you but imma pass.” So i told him I’d get it myself. Of course I’m lured back to his place where I tell him how I felt and he says that he likes me being in his presence but I’m not entitled to his time.......

I let it go and spend about another 2hrs on his couch doing nothing while he watches football and sits on his phone. Finally after literally 15 yawns later (i counted) i get up and leave. He didn’t kiss me goodbye, didn’t tell me to dry home safe, didn’t say i love you, and just sent me on my way. I’m now typing this about 30 mins later and he hasn’t even checked to see if I’ve made it home safely. 

Now I’m not sure if I have the right to be upset but I’m upset...... and im not sure how to express that because he did tell me he wanted me to leave 2 days ago after all. Opinions &amp; advice greatly appreciated!

My parents bought a condo in Mexico and wanted the family to see it before they invited extended family / friends. They invited me and my bf if 4 years and my brother and his wife are going. We pretty much only have to pay for the flight because we have the condo to stay in and my dad usually covers meals(he’s amazing). My BF can’t take the time off because he’s broke and is working on becoming a full time musician so he needs to be able to take any gig he can get so he said he couldn’t come. My dad even offered to pay for his flight. I mentioned it 2 different times making sure he didn’t want to come but I wasn’t pushy either. I still said I was going because I am self employed literally for this reason, so I don’t have to miss out on shit like this. I invited a girlfriend and she is going to come for half the trip and I told him about it and he got mad at me that I was “rubbing it in his face”. All I said was “I invited Tara to come to Mexico and she said she can come for half of it!!”. He ignored me and later said that He’s mad at me for going on this trip and not waiting till he can come.

68,"My (35/M) wife (35/F) of five years no longer wants to be in an open relationship now that I've had sex with someone else for the first time in the two years since she had asked if we could give it a try.


First I want to make clear on the fact that I love my wife. I've never been physical with anyone else since we got together ten years ago. The idea of an open relationship had never so much as crossed my mind until she had suggested it. At the time we were so focused on our twins (3/F) and (3/M) that we had no time for our marriage and there was undoubtedly a bit of emotional distance which then turned into a lot after we had failed to address it early on. We finally had a long and honest conversation about what to do. I suggested we designate at least one night a week that we go on a date. Both of our families lived close and had expressed interest in babysitting for us on multiple occasions. We could also have hired a sitter or a part-time nanny for date nights. 

My wife was receptive to the idea. We tried it out for a couple of months and it went well, I thought. I felt closer to her like before we had the twins and she was all smiles and laughter again. The emotional distance was no more. Our sex life had also improved. Things were good. Then ... she asked if we could have a ""serious talk"" after work one night. I figured that it had something to do with the twins, so I was initially very worried but she reassured me that the twins were utterly okay. Instead she explained that she had been reading up on open relationships. She provided me with various articles, books, podcasts, etc., that have to do with the topic. I could tell where she was headed but I wanted her to say it with words. She finally did. 

Something along the lines of, ""Let's give it a try and see how it goes. We can write down some rules and guidelines like no coworkers or friends or anyone we know well enough that we would run into them. And only sex. No emotions involved.""

She had explained it a little better than that, but that was pretty much what it came down to. 

At the time I didn't know how to process the suggestion. I had never been in an open relationship before. I had no desire to be in one. But I could tell that she was serious about it, so I gave it some thought for a couple of weeks and then came to the decision that it was at least worth a shot. It didn't mean we were going to be fucking other people every other day or even remotely close to that. Just ... if the opportunity arose, we wouldn't immediately turn it down like we had before. I would say I can be pretty openminded. A few of our friends were in (and still are in) open relationships at the time, so the suggestion wasn't a complete departure. 

For months neither of us acted on it. But the fact that we could have acted on it had drastically improved our marriage in a very real way. I guess just in terms of ... liberation? Not sure how to describe the feeling but it was there. We had talked about it and we had both agreed that we felt more in love with each other than ever before. There was one instance on a work trip when a woman at the airport had flirted with me at the gate. I was on a work trip (alone but still work related) so at no point did I consider getting her information but I did flirt back and it felt good. It just ... wasn't a big deal. I spoke to my wife about it and she told me that she had flirted with another man as well and we both just laughed at how high school we sounded in that moment. 

Some weeks later she told me that someone had asked her out and that she had explained our situation to them, but she wanted to know if I was okay with it before proceeding. Apparently it was just going to be dinner. A quick date just to see if she truly has the desire to be sexual with someone else. I told her that I was okay with it. She went out with the guy and came home a few hours later telling me that they had kissed and that she had felt a connection but not an emotional one by any means. Only sexual like we had agreed. 

Anyway I don't want to go on for too long. Basically she has had sex with three other men (multiple times each) since we opened our marriage. I'm okay with that. Until a few days ago I hadn't actually had sex with any other women, which was mostly due to the fact that I didn't want to force myself into it with just anyone. It had to be someone I was attracted to. I had to feel a sexual connection with them before taking that step, which I hadn't before this one woman that I had met at an art show a few weeks ago. I told my wife about her and explained that this woman is also in an open relationship, so it was actually kind of perfect in the sense that we both knew there was no worry of either of us catching feelings. 

My wife seemed okay with it. She told me to have fun on the date and that was that. We went out on a date and ended up having sex by the end. I came home the following morning and told my wife what happened. She had suspected as much given that I had stayed out all night, which I previously hadn't. We were allowed to spend the night with our other sexual partners. I had also sent her a text message to let her know that I wasn't going to be coming home that night, so it wasn't as though I had left her waiting. But the way she spoke to me in the kitchen after my shower ... she may as well have just accused me of cheating. I was confused by her reaction. The folded arms, the accusing looks, etc. When I asked if she was okay, she pursed her lips for a moment and then just curtly said something along the lines of, ""I guess I have to be okay, don't I?"" 

After reassuring her that I felt no emotional attachment towards this other woman, she seemed to relax a bit. I could tell she was still upset, but that she probably didn't want to expand on her concerns because she knew that I hadn't actually done anything wrong in terms of what we had agreed on. I suggested we sit down and talk it out after breakfast. We took to our favourite breakfast spot and then talked at home afterwards. She told me that she hadn't slept all night and that I looked ""too happy"" walking through the door after I had returned from my date, which had triggered her a bit. Suddenly our open relationship had become ""very real"" for her in a way that she had never expected. I asked what she meant. Did she expect that I would never have sex with any other women? Or did she expect that she wouldn't care if I did? She said it was a bit of both. Because I hadn't taken advantage of the opportunity sooner, she had grown used to being the only one, in a sense. She also explained that because she hadn't had sex with anyone else in well over a year, she had almost subconsciously thought that we were closed again. We had never stated it with words but that was just how she had felt deep down, but she had no idea that she felt that way until I had sent her that text message saying that I wasn't going to be coming home the previous night. 

I asked if she still wanted to be in an open relationship. She said she needed time to think it over. I've given her space to think it through. It's been a few days. Last night she approached me after dinner and stated that she no longer wants to be open. I was a little disappointed to hear it, simply because there was such a huge gap in our experiences. And the way she worded it felt a little like she was trying to guilt me for doing exactly what we had agreed we would do. I had never guilted her after one of her dates. That was never the energy. But she certainly had that energy towards me. In any case, I love my wife, so of course I've agreed to close our marriage again. 

Now that I've slept on it, I guess I just feel a bit ... manipulated? Not because she changed her mind (which is allowed) but because she had tried to guilt me. The folded arms, the accusing looks, the curt statements, etc. And apart from asking if we could talk after dinner last night, every step of trying to work through this was taken by me. Maybe she was a little bit embarrassed for having changed her mind after just one instance in which I had spent the night with someone else. It's confusing for me given that she had previously been so encouraging in the past. Oh and when I asked her if she wanted to go to Whistler for her birthday (in two weeks) she passive aggressively said, ""I'm surprised you even remembered."" At what point in the past ten years have I ever once let her birthday slip my mind? 

Not one time. 

I don't know. Her energy is just weird right now. I can tell she wants me to feel bad for what happened. But I don't. 

I would like to ask her why she's acting like this but I don't know how to word it in a way that is clear and concise without coming across accusatory or as though I feel she has been overreacting. Because of course, we're all allowed to change our minds. It's okay to have emotional responses sometimes. But it's been days and she's still being passive aggressive. 

**tl;dr** I'm okay with closing the relationship again, but I feel pretty manipulated at this point given that she has had sex with multiple different men in the past two years and I've never once guilted for it. The way she's treating me, it's as if I cheated or did something just as wrong, which simply isn't the case at all."
69,"I found two condoms in the backpack my boyfriend uses to go to work. We haven’t use condoms in the past two years and we having been dating for three years. I have found him sexting girls and other stuff too. I love him but don’t know if I can live with this. What should I do? Is he cheating?


I have trust issue with my boyfriend since the beginning of our relationship. His previous girlfriend was Venezuelan like me and we do look alike.

We broke up once because I caught him sexting with a bunch of girls on Instagram. I recently found porn and nudes of his ex girlfriends in his iPad. Mine nudes were also part of this album which sickens me to my very core. I am just one of those girls. 

Now I found condoms in the backpack he uses to go to work. Two of them. We don’t use condoms anymore so obviously is not for us. Also, we barely have sex. Last time we had sex was in May.

I love him but it breaks my heart that he keeps hurting my feelings. We broke up in the past and got back after a month because I wanted I give him another chance. I fantasied about marrying him. He told me once that he wanted to marry me...

He’s 30 and I am 20. He’s american and I am Venezuelan. He has been the only boyfriend I’ve had in my life. I go to college and live in Boston on a student visa. I want to go to medical school in the US but I need a green card for that. If I marry him I could fulfill my dream of becoming a doctor. But I don’t know if I could live with trust issues for the rest of my life. I am not sure if he’s the person I want to spend the rest of my life with... but at the same time I want stability in my life, something I won’t find if I go back to Venezuela.

Should I continue my relationship like nothing ever happened and eventually marry him to fulfill my dream? Or break up with him and move on with my life? 

TL;DR: I have trust issues with my partner. I found condoms in his backpack and have caught him doing other stuff in the past. I wanted to marry him because I love him and also to get a green card. But don’t know if I can live with this. What should I do?"
70,"I’m [F/32] struggling with husband’s [M/28] “my money, your money” view, especially now that we are having a baby together.


Bit of a background about us - I [F/32] have been with my (now husband) [M/28] for 7 years (married 1.5 years). When we first got together I had just come back from traveling around Europe and had nothing to my name. After about 6 months things were going well and we decided to buy a house together. We went to a solicitor and drew up a prenup which stated if we broke up he would be entitled to the $68,000 deposit he paid on the house and his $30k boat and $10k ute he owned before we met (which is 100% fair and I totally agreed with).

Income-wise he earns about $143k a year and I earn roughly $45k. He has options for as much overtime as he wants and works quite a lot of overtime (as well as doing quite a few ""cashies""/perk jobs) whereas I work in a 9-5 desk job with no options of overtime. We have been paying off the mortgage fortnightly at a much higher rate than we are required to (our payments need to be $513 fortnightly and we are paying $1650). So of my $1528 take-home pay I am paying $1150 towards the mortgage and $100 towards a car loan (which I just finished paying off this week hooray). 

We have separate accounts at different banks that our pays go into so I have no idea how much he earns each pay and obviously it differs each week with overtime etc but his wages go towards bills and every day expenses, extra savings and capital gains taxes for an investment section we bought and sold. The rest is our ""fun/play money"" and up to us what we want to spend it on. In terms of our ""fun money"" of $150 a week (although mine was a little less due to car payments) he also takes a 30% portion extra on top of the $150 a week ""fun money"" out of his over time. When I questioned him about this he said he believes it's fair because he's ""got to have some incentive to do all the extra hours.""

This means he has plenty of money for new rifles, fishing gear, he recently went halves with his mate on a 16k jetboat. We are expecting our first child in February and although I just finished paying off my car I am now trying to save for a bigger more reliable car that can fit a carseat/stroller etc with my ""fun money"" because he already has his own truck paid upfront. The other day I purchased a steam mop on our joint account and he said it was an unnecessary expense and we can't afford it right now with a baby on the way so I ended up having to use my ""fun money"" to pay for the mop. My fun money also has to cover things like my gym membership and if I ever want to get my hair coloured or if I go out for a girls night with my friends it comes out of that money too. I know that we are lucky to even have any ""fun money.""  

Anyway....sorry for the novel.....basically I have always struggled with the ""my money your money"" thing. It's not how I was brought up, my parents have always had a joint account. I have brought this up with him before and he writes down a whole lot of figures explaining what he contributes vs what I’m contributing…. and in his head he is trying to be fair and logical but it’s got to the stage where I don’t even feel like we are a team. I feel as though we are running more like a business than a relationship. 

When bubs arrives I will be on maternity leave for a year (I would love to stay at home with our child for a bit longer after that but he will want me back at work earning money) and I am petrified how a year of me not earning is going to go - and he is already stressed about how we are going to 'survive' on one income. It's such a hard topic to bring up. He always says ""All my friends have separate accounts for their fun/play money and it works great"" and he can't seem to understand my perspective.

I guess I am just wanting advice on what to do from here? When I bring it up he's very good at just writing out numbers and saying it's fair given how hard he works and how much overtime he is going to have to do when the baby arrives. And he says things like he's doing it for us so we aren't in so much debt later on and I suppose I am a bit of a pushover and I just let it go in the end coz he starts making me think that I am being unreasonable. 

I feel like if we don't tackle this further now then it is going to get far harder once a child is in the mix.

TLDR: Husband likes to keep our earnings separate &amp; have a percentage of his overtime go towards his “fun/play” money. We are expecting our first child so I won’t be earning for at least a year &amp; am worried how things are going to go with us both living off just his earnings."
71,"my (23X) parents (60s M&amp;F) will not stop asking me for money


this has been an ongoing thing, but at this point i feel like i’m going to snap and i need to do something about it. sorry i’m advance if this is all over the place, it’s A Lot. 

to preface the story itself: i’m 23 and i just recently moved from my home state to NYC to live in an apartment with my partner of two years. we split all our expenses evenly- rent, bills, groceries, utilities. my partner is more well off than i am, and comes from a wealthy family, but he is very responsible with his money; and early on we discussed that it’s very important to me that we both pay equal shares of everything as far as bills and shared expenses go.

until three weeks ago, i had a full time job that paid me very little, and even with the money i made there i was mostly living off the savings i’d accrued over several years while living with my parents. my partner had offered to help me on more than one occasion, but i told him that while i was incredibly grateful, i did not want to borrow money that i might not be able to pay back. i'd rather be in a rough spot myself than put him in one. we’d forgone things we like to do together, like seeing shows and going out to eat, because i did not have the funds. i haven't bought myself new clothes in   
a year. sometimes my partner would insist on paying for something more expensive we could do together, but in those few cases i always paid him back for my share of the meal/ticket/etc. 

presently, my new job pays me more. it’s not a lot, especially considering the cost of living here, but it’s enough that i can actually afford my bills and even save a little now. i’m working on trying to build up a decent amount of savings again and replacing the money i’d had to spend on bills and food for the past two months. i’ve only received one paycheck from the new job so far, as i am paid biweekly. i still work the other job in my spare time for some extra cash, but even with that i’m still working on getting back to a place where i have the extra money to live more comfortably than i have been and afford luxuries like new clothes and nice meals.

even when i lived with my parents, once i began working part time jobs in high school, they’d ask me for “rent” ($400 monthly) and additional money throughout the month to cover the bills they couldn’t pay. they presently live in a mobile home community, and their only other child is my 22 year old chronically unemployed brother who presently still lives at home. my brother has no interest in college or working, which is fine because college isn’t for everyone, but they let him continue not to even search for a job.

my entire life, both my parents have been terrible with money. for as long as i can remember, we’ve had to deal with the utilities being shut off, calls from debt collectors, my parents fighting about money. when i was in high school they filed for bankruptcy. when i had to come home from college they lost the house and moved into a mobile home. 

they have been asking me for money since i began working at the age of 17. both my parents have always worked and still do, my mom part time and my dad full time. even so, they never had money. i had no idea how to stand up for myself, how to say no, so i gave it to them. i kept giving it to them, even when i had to dig into my tiny savings account to do it. i thought i owed them for clothing me and giving me shelter. i’ve even given them money when i was scraping pennies together to buy myself groceries when i lived with my roommate. in retrospect i shouldn’t have, but that’s another issue entirely and one i am working through in therapy. 

i’ve never had the luxury of being able to ask them for even $20 when i was at my most desperate. i’ve never had someone to talk to me about budgeting and being financially responsible, no one to tell me the importance of saving and investing.  i only finished a semester of college before i had to drop out due to finances- i had taken a year between graduating high school and beginning college to work and save money, but because of that there were a lot of scholarships i was not eligible for. both my parents have terrible credit so i could not get any loans, even with fafsa. when i had to drop out of school, i came home and went right back to working. i just recently paid off the debt id accrued from the single federal loan i had managed to qualify for.

at the beginning of this year i finally was making enough money that i could move out to live with a roommate and try to gain some independence (something i had to fight tooth and nail for, unfortunately), and then two months ago i moved to new york. 

i’ve stayed in minimal contact with them since i moved, enjoying the feeling of freedom and comfort that i’ve found here in my new home.i thought they might still try to ask me for money here and there, so when they wanted to know how much i made at my new job, i lied and said it was less than it is. i text my mom once a day every few days, but my dad rarely reaches out- which is why i found it suspicious that he not only texted me this morning but used a nickname he used to call me as a child. i asked how he had been, and he launched right into asking me for $500.

i have not responded. i know i’m going to tell him no, but i don’t know \*how\*. there are a ton of non-financial issues in this post, i’m aware, but what i’m asking for is advice on how to refuse my dad’s money request. i should have been refusing all along; but now that i am more confident, independent, and secure in myself, i can see that now. they were not bad parents, but they definitely left me stunted both emotionally and financially, and their continuous poor decisions are not my responsibility. i’m not going to sacrifice my independence and the life i am building with my partner. i am living in my favorite place. i have a job in my dream field and opportunities to move up. i do not want their lives and bad patterns to become my own.

TL;DR: my parents have been financially irresponsible and asked me for money my entire life. they both work and have credit cards (and credit card debt). i don’t live with them anymore and they’re still asking me for money. i want to finally stand up for myself. how do i say no?"
72,"I want my sister(f28) to breakup with her boyfriend(m26) and put her daughter(f7) first.


I(f26) want to start off by saying it’s pretty late as I’m writing this and I’m a little upset so if something doesn’t make sense I’m sorry(also on a mobile). 
A little background, my sister got pregnant at 19 and had my niece at 20. I ended up raising my niece for the first five years of her life. 
 I have never liked any of my sisters  boyfriends but I have to say her current one is the worst. 
He hates kids. He stated that he doesn’t want to be around kids and never wants have any of his own. I told my sister that this should be a deal breaker because she has a daughter. She didn’t think that mattered. 
When my niece was around five my sister gave her boyfriend an ultimatum. Either her and her daughter get to move in with him or he’ll never see her again. They ended up moving in. I was pretty heartbroken since I was the one who was taking care of my niece up to that point. I was also incredibly nervous. My sister had never taken care of my niece on her own. 
After they moved in my niece would call me almost everyday asking why I didn’t move with her. Every time we were out as a family my niece would beg to stay with my parents. Other relatives took notice and asked why she never wanted to be home.
 Whenever I saw my niece with my sisters boyfriend he would yell at her. He would just snap over the smallest things. This made me incredibly angry. He is not her father and I don’t think he has any right to tell my niece what to do. I told my sister that he is way to harsh with my niece and she just brushed it off. 
Fast forward to today. I was picking up my sister around 7pm so we could go out. My niece was going to be watched by my sisters boyfriend. When I arrived at her house I saw my niece crying. She wasn’t throwing a tantrum or anything she was on her knees begging my sister not to leave. I actually felt sick to my stomach seeing that. I told my sister that we could stay. She got angry saying that my niece always does this when she trying to leave.
About 15 min after we left my niece calls crying saying she wants us to come home. My sisters boyfriend rips the phone from her and says she’s fine and that there is no reason for her to be crying like this. I wanted to go back but my sister refused. 
I have been thinking about this all night and I just feel awful. My sister was talking about getting engaged and it blows my mind how she could not consider my nieces feelings. It is so clear she doesn’t want to be around her boyfriend but she doesn’t care. 
How do I get it through her head that her daughter should come first? How do I get her to break up with him? I feel like I’ve told her a million times that he’s a pos and she never listens. What else can I do?

TL;DR My sisters boyfriend treats my niece terribly and I think my sister needs to break up with him."
