0,"I'm [28 F] calling off the wedding [28 M]


Where do I start... I've known my fiancé for about 12 years now. Been together for 6 years. He was a rebellious teenager, but eventually cleaned up his ways. We've been through a lot together and gone through major struggles together. He is successful now. He's an Army officer. We planned on getting married next Friday. He graduates on Tuesday. He ditched his old friends and hangs out with fellow officers now and I honestly think they changed him. They're very much like frat boys. He hated drinking, but seems to drink everyday now. We haven't lived with each other for 2 years because he is stationed in another state so I don't know how much he drinks a day. I flew out to see him 3 weeks ago.

Yesterday he asked me to go to the bar to meet his Army friends for the first time. We get to the bar and almost everyone he knows is already wasted. I don't drink so it was very awkward for me. All his friends were very nice, but younger than us. 2 hours later my fiancé is beyond wasted and everyone has noticed. Probably the drunkest guy at the bar and there were a ton of people at that bar. He walks off and starts hugging this girl that he claimed he disliked. I asked him why he hugged her and he said ""I was trying to nudge my friend Brendan on the shoulder and it just looked like I was hugging her. And then she hugged me back"" Whatever. The night goes on and he accidentally bumps into a guy at the bar really hard and doesn't notice. The guy gets pissed and is about to throw a punch at the back of his head. Fortunately his friend held him back. That's when I hear people next to me whispering ""That guy is really drunk..."" A guy walks up to me and starts throwing pick up lines at me. I try to politely let him down and walk away when I suddenly hear ""Is that guy flirting with you?!!?"" from my fiancé. Of course he is, but I say ""No"" to avoid a fight. I go up to my fiancé and tell him he's had enough. We walk out the bar and he starts groping me and trying to get me to bend over in front of him. I tell him I want to go home so he pulls out his phone and goes to the Uber app. He stood there for 5 minutes because he couldn't remember his log in or phone number. He finally gets in the app and we keep getting ""UBER UNAVAILABLE"" I ask him who else could pick us up and he says ""Uh... I don't know"" and stares off into space. All his friends are drunk. His family is not in town. No Uber available. I start worrying because we have nowhere to go. Then he asks ""Do you have my apartment key?"" I say ""Yes. Why?"" He says ""Give it to me..."" I tell him ""No. I'll carry it for you. You might lose it"" He starts getting aggressive and says ""GIVE IT TO ME. YOU DON'T PAY THE RENT."" I say ""How can you say that? We're getting married in a month"" I get uncomfortable so I walk away from him and call my mom then his mom because my mind is spinning and I need advice on where to go. He follows me and I'm crying. He asks ""Why are you crying? What did I do?"" and pretends he doesn't remember anything that happened because now both of our mothers know now and one of his friends bumped into us and is staring at me crying. We finally get a Lyft home and I can honestly say we got the sketchiest Lyft driver imaginable. I thought he'd rob us. We get inside and he goes straight to the bedroom. I thought he knocked out. 30 minutes later I walk in and see the bathroom light on. I try to open it and it's locked. I bang on the door and get no response. He finally opens the door butt naked and screams at me for interrupting his sleep. I get in contact with his friend and apparently this is normal behavior now. I didn't think he'd change so much in 2 years. I don't mind that he drinks, but he doesn't know when to stop. The careless behavior associated with it is scary. He can also get in massive trouble for drinking too much. I don't know how to approach this situation without causing an uproar.

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR - I found out my fiancé is a heavy drinker now and our wedding is in 7 days. How do I approach the situation? I don't mind calling off the wedding."
1,"I (21F) am thinking about a divorce from my husband (23M) of one year over him no longer wanting kids with me. Am I being hasty?


My husband and I have barely been married for one year (no kids yet and not pregnant), and in that year I have gone from a sorta-Christian to an atheist. He has gone from a sorta-Christian to a die-hard Christian. I totally support him and don’t care to change his beliefs. 

But I finally told him last night about my atheism after keeping it a secret since March. It was a really heated argument, and he said he wouldn’t want to have kids with me if I wasn’t a Christian. It is important for him, in his own words, for his children to love and fear God.

I told him it’s fine with me if he raises our kids in Christianity, and I’ll even drop them off at church if he wants me to, but they’re going to know that daddy believes and mommy does not. I wouldn’t be outspoken about my atheism toward them, but I wouldn’t directly teach them Christianity, and if they asked me questions about Christianity, I would probably redirect it with a question like “well what does daddy say about that? what does the bible say?”

This answer did not satisfy my husband. He said  that my opinions are important to kids and he doesn’t want me to plant seeds of doubt in their minds. 

I told him that if I can’t have kids, I don’t think this marriage will work. 

On one hand, I’m glad I’m figuring this out while I’m still young and have plenty of prime reproductive years left. But on the other hand, am I giving up too fast? I can’t even explain why having kids is so important to me. I love my husband so much. But I can’t let him take that away from me. And if he feels so strongly about our kids knowing mommy is a Christian, then what else would he make me change about myself since I’m an atheist?

Any advice or kind words appreciated. Telling me that I learned my lesson from marrying too young will not be welcomed. 

TLDR: I became an atheist since marrying my husband last year, and now that he knows, he no longer wants to have kids with me. I think divorce is my only option."
2,"My boyfriend (23) is accusing me (21) of cheating on him after I drunkenly slept in the wrong room at his house


Last night my boyfriend and I went to a local fair by his house. We drank quite a few beers and ended up walking back to his house later to sleep. All of his family were gone so we had the house to ourselves. I remember going to bed with him in his room and then before I knew it, it was morning and he was screaming at me to wake up. He said “What are you fucking doing in here” and started immediately throwing around accusations. I explained to him that I went into the wrong room after going to the bathroom out of sheer tiredness and being drunk. My phone was in his room and well as my belongings. Obviously my intention were not to switch rooms. But, he didn’t believe me. He searched the entire upstairs and looked around his sisters room. Convinced I had snuck someone into his house and cheated on him when he was two doors down. It makes zero sense. 

On top of that, I have never given him a reason to be suspicious. I’ve never cheated on him, talked to other people, etc. Regardless of that, every now and then he’ll have a full blown freak out and accuse me of cheating on him. I feel a little speechless considering I did nothing but the worst was automatically assumed. I don’t know where to go from here because I had to leave for work after he woke me up and he texted me as I was out the door saying “sketchiest thing you’ve done, don’t talk to me for awhile”. This means everything will he dragged on for days while he ghosts me. Just curious, how do I move on from here? Do I try to talk to him or just let this drag on forever? Also, why does he do this?

Tdlr: My boyfriend and I fell asleep together at his empty house and during the night I woke up to go to the bathroom and drunkenly fell asleep in his sisters room instead. Now he is accusing me of cheating on him."
3,"I'm (24f) a higher earner and a lower spender than my boyfriend, (28m) and it's causing some arguments.




Just to get the facts out first; I make 85k (USD) a year, and my boyfriend makes 50k.

I spend about $2000 a month and my boyfriend spends about $3000 a month. (this spending refers to rent, transportation, food, fun, hobbies, shopping, everything) 

This is for a couple reasons, he has a car payment for a new car when I got a cheap used car off Craigslist that I paid for in full. He has higher rent and lives in a nicer neighborhood, when I live in an area that's got mainly dirt cheap student housing. I spend less on day to day stuff too.

We've been arguing mainly when we have different ideas of how much to spend on things. Like dining out for example.

I'm a fan of going to the college bar that has 2 dollar beer specials and 5 dollar food after 9, and I like another restaurant that has half price pizza after 10. I don't mind eating late to get those deals, but my boyfriend always wants to have an earlier dinner, or eat pricier places. 

The next thing is my car. It's old and beat up, and I've decided to just drive it into the dirt, not pay any more to keep an old car limping along, but keep driving it till it fails. And my boyfriend thinks that's an awful idea; that I'll break down somewhere. But I only drive around the city that has very good bus service and Uber access, so when I break down it's never too bad. I had to ditch my car once because I blew two tires and it was ok. Just got a bus home and then got it fixed the next day.

The next is transportation, I get free bus rides to and from work because my job pays for it. So I take the bus rather than putting more wear and tear on my car, and costing gas money. My boyfriend doesn't like this because I have to get up an hour earlier than I would if I drove. So when we spend the night together I wake him up getting out of bed early. Plus he doesn't like the unpredictably of when I'll be home, because the bus was late.

I feel like he's pressuring me to spend more, often. He always says I have the money and he doesn't get why I'm being so cheap. (I always answer that it's because I want the security of savings and investment more than I want to spend. My family was always broke and I never want to stress about money again. I want an emergency fund, and a lot of money put away early for retirement.

Overall, it's stressing me out, it feels like he wants to spend my money for me, or push me to spend when I don't want to.

Am I right to be stressed??

tldr My boyfriend and I have a lot of money related disagreements."
4,"My boyfriend [27/M] keeps delaying our talk to the point that I [25/F] am on the brink of ending things via text.


 

Hey hey.

&amp;#x200B;

I've been with my boyfriend for a little over a year now and things have not been going well as of late. We had a fight on Tuesday morning (7/9) that resulted in him storming out of my place before work, so I texted him that evening to let him know that I would like to meet up and have an in-depth discussion about our relationship (as there are multiple things that are making me unhappy). Despite me preferring to meet up sooner rather than later (and vocalizing such), we agreed to Friday after work because he said he had a lot going on during the week. Friday came and he asked if we could reschedule to Sunday (today). I was not pleased but I agreed. 

&amp;#x200B;

Today I woke up to a text from him that said ""I just woke up and I have band practice in 45 minutes, my bandmates want to go get lunch afterward, and I need to work on a project for work that is due tomorrow morning. I was really hoping to be up earlier to see you."" Suffice to say, this made me pretty upset. One of the main issues that I am having with the relationship is that I feel unprioritized and that he is lazy in the relationship. I told him it was uncool and he said: ""I have all evenings open this week, it's my bandmate's birthday otherwise I wouldn't go, and I am not de-prioritizing this talk."" I told him that he absolutely is de-prioritizing it, he said, ""No I'm not and you can think what you want, so please let me know which day this week works best for you."" I concluded with, ""I'm good. I deserve better than to be put on the backburner.""

&amp;#x200B;

I don't know where to go from here. I know it's pretty weak to end a relationship over text but I am just so frustrated with the reschedulings and him not taking this seriously. Before we agreed on a day/time to talk, I had already considered that the talk might end with a breakup because of the things that I am unhappy about, and now this is just pushing me over the edge. Any advice on what I should do? Am I justified in feeling this way?

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR: boyfriend has been delaying/rescheduling our talk numerous times and I am at the point that I want to end things over text. Am I justified?"
5,"My ex-bestfriend's ex [19M] and I [19F] have feelings for each other and we're not sure what to do.


My ex-bestfriend has liked this guy for a long time but he never felt the same way and she knows this. He's been rejecting her for a year but she still feels entitled towards him and everything he does. He decided to give things a chance because he really cared about her as a person and accept her request to be in a relationship for a month but he realized he wasn't comfortable so he ended things (October 2018). She still wants him as of now. My ex bestfriend ended things with me abruptly back in April saying she doesn't want to be friends with me for reasons like me being too negative etc. and she said really hurtful things that i never expected her to say. After that, her ex and I started talking and realized we do like each other. This was not planned at all whatsoever as we always kept our distance from each other out of respect for our mutual friend. I never thought I would like someone this much and we really want to be with each other. I don't know what to do.

TLDR; have feelings for someone i'm not supposed to."
6,"What to do about my (18) brother(23) and his toxic fiance (22)


Hey all. So my brother and his fiance have been together for around 7 years now. To be honest we didn't start off great to begin with, my family and I were really nice with her and tried to treat her like part of the family. But she was just weird with us, she didn't talk to us or eat in front of us. If we went out for dinner she demanded that her and my brother have a separate table away from the rest of the family. She didn't let him go on vacation with us.

She did a lot of different shit over the years, if I was talking to them and she wanted to eat they would just kick me out of the room. When our parents were away she purposefully left a mess that I would have to clean up. Planned her birthday party on the day of my birthday so he couldn't go. Rummaging through my room while I was gone. Petty stuff like that. But what was worse was what she's done to my brother, when he got with her he had a lot of friends, he's always been a happy go lucky, outgoing person. But she stopped letting him see his friends and going to family get togethers. (My other brother and sister live in a different city so we don't see them often)

About two years ago they both moved in together in a city 3 hours away for university. We see him once every one or two months now which is okay. But she doesn't let him go out or have friends, which just seems so bizarre to me, I feel like he should be enjoying himself in university, but she just has him cleaning the apartment all the time.

The latest thing that's happened was that my sister (27)  had an engagement party. My brother's fiance came out with this demand that either they go home with her friend before the party or that my parents drive them home (again, 6 hour drive all in all) afterwards. Oh, and she wasn't even going to the party, just him. Basically just she wasn't letting him go, she wanted to ruin the party for my sister. 

He ended up going regardless and as punishment, she ignored him on the phone for two days, and that he was allowed to come home when she was away to work. 

Another thing is that she's been trying to plan their wedding, even though he's expressed openly that he doesn't want to get married yet. She texted my mum from his phone (he's dyslexic and doesn't type the way she did in the text) demanding that my parents would have to give them £4,000 for the wedding.

Just to clarify, this isn't some petty thing just because he's my brother. I adore my other brother's boyfriend and sister's fiance, they fit so well into the family. My family have tried so hard to make my brother's fiance fit in and feel comfortable.

I don't know what to do now, he reconciled with her as soon as he went home. I don't want to associate with either of them anymore, I just feel like they bring in too much stress. Is it childish for me to just stop talking to them? The thing that pisses me off most is the engagement thing, my sister has gone through a lot and is the one person who deserves to  be happy, it hurts to know that my brother's fiance wanted to ruin that for her.

TLDR: Brother's fiance controls his every move, including which friends and family he sees. Didn't let my brother go to sister's engagement party. Brother is too immature and doesn't stand up for himself. I need some advice on how to deal with them.

Sorry for the super long post but I feel like you needed that context 😅 Thanks in advance!"
7,"My (35F) boyfriend (33M) of 5 years secretly took a cab to take ""a walk"" at night while out of town.


My 33M boyfriend is in San Fran for an interview. We were video chatting w/ our 3 year old after the interview yesterday. Saying he missed us etc. All normal happy stuff.

He left NJ at 3am for the flight there, told us he was exhausted and headed to bed.

I messaged him at 2:10am my time (11:10pm his) that I was up changing sheets bc our 3 yo wet the bed again. He responded with 'poor girl' and nothing else.

This morning we video call him as was planned during breakfast for our kid to say hello to daddy. He answers without video which is not normal. We call frequently with video. I asked when did you get home and he kinda hesitated before saying 3am. He offered nothing else.

I found this morning he took a lyft to Chinatown at 1120pm PST and didn't cab back to his hotel til 3am.

He messages me nothing, says nothing so I message him after breakfast about being out all night and he says he needed to take a walk. Says no cheating happened.

This man has a terrible sense of direction. Cant read a map etc. But went for a walk in a city he doesnt know from 1130pm-3am... Huh?

And mentioned nothing about it even though he knew I was awake here at the same time changing sheets on the east coast. Why not mention that he cant sleep and am headed out? No pictures or comments about his walk. Says he was going to mention it in the morning.

Thoughts? My nerves are shot. He has a major history of being dishonest. This was our time to be transparent and open to rebuild trust for our family. Why leave his hotel (which is already on the water with a fantastic view) in the middle of the night?

I'm ready to pack up and leave him.

TL;DR Boyfriend out 1130pm-3am when he said was going to bed. Has history of lies, says didnt cheat. Says couldnt sleep, took a 20 dollar cab to Chinatown to ""go for a walk"". Sees issue with what he did. I feel gaslighted."
8,"My boyfriend (28m) seems to think I'm lazy (24f) since my job is less crazy demanding than his



I have a pretty cushy job in tech research &amp;prototyping, I'll be the first to admit that. 

I work 35 hours a week, no more, and have total freedom to set my hours, as long as I am there for my meetings, and get my work done.

I get full-time benefits and healthcare despite that. I get paid well too. I've paid off my student loans and have set aside a pretty good amount of money to start my retirement fund too. And I've got enough income on top of that to have some fun too.

I enjoy the work I do, it's really interesting and cutting edge. And I get along well with my coworkers, we go out bar hopping once or twice a month. My boss is great, he's really supportive of everyone's personal development, and helping everyone who works for him get involved in projects that fit their interests and help them develop skills they want to learn. 

Despite all that, it's still a job, it takes work and commitment and motivation. I don't see myself as a slacker. I worked really hard at school, and at previous crappy jobs, to get where I am now. 

----

My boyfriend Alex also works in tech, he's working at a gaming company as a programmer. And even though he's doing what he always dreamed of doing, he's not enjoying his day-to-day work as much.

He works a lot longer hours, his company's management does not seem good at realistic time management so his team is always working insane hours before big deadlines, rather than being prepared more in advance. He also has a lot more coworker drama, some of the people he works with come off as very immature. He doesn't have flexible hours, and it doesn't seem like he finds as much fulfillment in his daily work.

----

It feels like he's starting to resent me for this. Or think I'm a slacker and lazy because of how our jobs differ. Or something like that.

I'll give a couple snippets of this, to give you an idea....

- A few weeks ago, he had a deadline coming up, and he and his coworker were pulling an all nighter on Thursday to get ready. I happened to be a little sick at the time, and I decided to work from home on Friday so I could cuddle up in bed and be more comfortable. I was sitting around catching up on some easy documentation when Alex came home from the all nighter, and he made a snippy comment about me skipping work. I said I was working, just from home. And he said something rude about how I must be working really hard, still being in bed at 11 am.

- I have invited Alex along for a few happy hours with my work friends, and he's always bragged about how little he's sleeping, how crazy long he's working... Like a lot of guys in tech seem to do. But my coworkers were all just like ""dude, that's crazy, get some sleep"" because they're really not the type to brag about that sort of thing. It's awkward.

- Alex keeps saying stuff about how I could use alllll the time I've got after work to pick up some contract work for extra money. And while he's right I could make a lot like that, I honestly don't want to deal with finding customers, negotiating contracts, making sure I get paid, and having all that cut into my own time. And he's called me lazy for that... 

----

Overall I feel like he's bought into this whole... Suffer for your career... Sleep little... Work like a maniac... Thing. And I think he feels like I'm lazy for not doing the same. But I also sometimes feel like he resents me, for the amount of free time and flexibility I have. It's complicated.

What should I do to keep this from being a constant issue?

TLDR - I have a job that gives me a very very good work-life balance. My boyfriend has a much more demanding job. He seems to be having some complicated feelings about it"
9,"My (25 F) Boyfriend (27M) of two years is obsessed with Dave and Busters?


I really don't know where to start with this, and it sounds very petty, but I am at my wit's end dealing with my boyfriend.   


Some context, we have been together for two years and he is overall fantastic. Very thoughtful, kind, funny, interesting, and responsible. For instance he always brings me my favorite snacks when he goes out without me even asking for them. He'll comfort me after a tough day at work (I work at a call center and get some crazy ones). For the most part he is also very respectful of me. We were both raised Catholic and he's very active in the church and an overall stand-up guy, which I admire a lot. Literally the only problem in our relationship is this obsession with Dave and Busters. I'm only telling you guys all of this so you don't just tell me to break up with him, because although we have this problem I really don't want to leave him.  


I guess I will just get to the bad part. My boyfriend absolutely must go to Dave and Busters once a week, or else he throws a tantrum. I am not exaggerating when I use the word ""tantrum"". We are talking crying, stomping, etc. It's bad. He will beg and plead, and state that the only thing he wants is for us to ""Go to Busters"" and if it's been more than a week he'll say we haven't been in ""forever"". I've tried talking it through with him. I have suggested other restaurants, even other barcades, but it \*has\* to be Dave and Busters. When I tell him I don't really enjoy going with him and that he could go alone, he says something like ""What do you mean, you love Busters, I give you all the prizes!"" When we do go, we spend a ridiculous amount of money (which I split with him), and he makes me follow him around to each game to play together.

tl;dr, my boyfriend is obsessed with D&amp;B's and won't accept not going there at least once a week. We have a great relationship other than this and I need help because I am really at a loss for how to deal with this"
10,"My [28F] best friend [30F] wants me to make a huge life decision on her life (UPDATE)


 [Original post](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/cbmlr7/my_28f_best_friend_30f_wants_me_to_make_a_huge/)

Hi! My first post didn’t get that much attention, but I thought I would update you guys since a few people were kind enough to be interested in my story.

I made my post on Wednesday, two days after my best friend Anna insisted I tell her what to do. I expected her to press me into “helping” her again, but it didn’t happen.

(I use the term best friend very widely here; I’m probably not Anna’s best friend, but she’s my oldest close friend and we helped each other through a lot of stuff in over 10 years, but we don’t talk every day or hang out that often)

Anyway, today she texted me “Why didn’t you tell me to stay?”

Turns out that she decided to break up with Paul last week. She lived pretty close from work, and now she’s staying with a friend and hates having to take two busses, and having no good restaurants that deliver food to her house nearby; she can’t afford living on her own in the neighborhood she lived with Paul, and refuses to get a roommate she doesn’t know. 

So she hates everything about her new life and literally complained for hours.

Some of you said that having new friends and being more independent is nothing to build a new personality on and abandon her long-term partner and boy, apparently you were so right.

I don’t want to meddle too much or say generic stuff like “you’ll soon get used to it” because I know it truly sucks to have such changes for the worse, so I just said “if you regret breaking up just talk to Paul, maybe he wants to get back together and you guys can finally find some middle ground”. They are both pretty stubborn so idk, and I won’t insist. I also said I was there for her whenever she needed to talk.

So things went to shit but I think that at least I did the right thing refusing to decide for her.

Tl;dr: my best friend wanted me to decide whether she should leave her long-term partner or not, over the fact that she changed and he didn’t, and they were annoyed at each other. I didn’t do it. She left him and regrets it."
11,"Do you think this is fair? My [28F] SO [29M] snoozes his alarm every 10mins for an hour!!


This udrives me nuts! More often than not my SO has to be at work 2 hours before I do, but he SUCKS at getting out of bed.

This morning he snoozed his alarm every 10 minutes for an hour and I still had two hours of precious sleep I could enjoy (I'm an awful sleeper so I very much value the time I'm able to).

So, me being mad, after 60 minutes I ripped off the comfortable and yelled GET UP NOW and some other profanities...

Well he just got home and he's pissed. And I'm pissed. I don't think he has a right to be mad since this happens constantly. 

What's a girl to do?

tl;dr my boyfriend snoozes his alarm for 60 minutes straight when I could be sleeping and it pisses me off!"
12,"My (28/F) boyfriend's (32/M) ex-girlfriend (30/F) from just over a year ago sent me a direct message with screenshots claiming that they had spent the night together when I was away on a business trip a few weeks back, but he denies it completely.


They were together for a couple of years. On and off. He and I were friends at the time. When they broke up, I noticed he had started making some good changes in his life. He was more focused on work, began to attend therapy and cut out a few of the more toxic friends that he had kept around. A few months after my ex and I had broken up, my current SO and I had decided to date. He asked me out and I figured it worth a try, so I went for it and we've been together ever since. 

We don't yet live together as it's still a bit soon into the relationship. But we see each other all the time. At least five or six times a week. We both work a lot, or we would probably spend even more time together. Lately he has been looking at a few apartments closer to where I live. Things have been going well between us. We haven't had any arguments. Naturally we've disagreed on a few things here and there, but it never got to the point of arguing or having to apologize for what was said. 

It's a mature relationship. I truly feel good about where we are as a couple. 

But of course, last night I got a direct message from his ex. At first I didn't know what I was looking at. I didn't even know it was her until a moment later. She and I had never really hung out outside of a few group situations. Anyway she wrote a lengthy message, saying that my boyfriend had sex with her when I was away on business a few weeks ago. She said it happened after they had crossed paths at a pub one night (a night that I remember because he told me that was going out for drinks with his friends). They said hello and exchanged numbers again. After a few drinks and after everyone else had left, he walked her back to her apartment and agreed to come up when she asked. 

They had sex. He left immediately after it was over and then sent her a string of text messages saying that it never should have happened. Those were included in the screenshots. He was basically like, ""That was a mistake. I'm sorry. I can't deal with this right now. I have a girlfriend and I love her. I don't know how that happened but I have some shit that I need to figure out. Please don't contact me again."" After that I guess she felt she had to say something, probably just to get back at him for cutting her off again. 

This happened three weeks ago. When I asked why she hadn't said anything sooner, she said that she was thinking about it and had tried to put the entire night into the back of her mind but eventually realized that she couldn't. 

I asked my boyfriend to stop by my apartment after work and he did, and I didn't say anything. Instead I just opened the screenshots on my phone and handed it to him without explaining what was going on. I wanted to see his expression. He seemed confused at first, as though he didn't know what he was looking at. Then he recognized his ex's name and photo and the pieces fell into place. Finally I asked, ""What's going on?"" and he replied with something along the lines of, ""I have no idea. These aren't from me."" 

He did most of the talking, basically explaining that he had in fact crossed paths with his ex at the pub that night, but that nothing happened beyond an awkward greeting. When I asked why he hadn't told me sooner, he said that he didn't feel it was important enough to mention. Because nothing happened. When I asked why his ex would go so far as to send me screenshots of an exchange that had never occurred, he insisted that she was probably just trying to get between us and reminded me that she was toxic for the entirety of their relationship. She was and no one really liked her. Not his friends, not his family, not his coworkers, etc. But to say she would do this after a year of us being together ... it feels a bit ... well, it feels unlikely is all I'm saying. Wouldn't she have pulled this sooner? 

He agreed that it was strange of her to wait all this time but he also said that she was probably hoping something would happen after they had run into each other. When he refused to speak to her for more than a moment, she probably felt type of way about it and then sent me bullshit screenshots to get back at him for paying her no mind. 

I asked if he could prove it and he said he would call his phone company and get a transcript of some sort to prove that those messages were never sent from his number. It's been a day. When I asked if he had called the phone company yet, his response was, ""Do you really think I would cheat on you?"" 

To me that's about as clear as it gets. The fact that he didn't contact them at his earliest convenience ... just to put this to bed ... it looks bad. Really fucking bad. 

I replied with, ""I don't know what to think. That's why I need you to put my mind to ease like you said you were going to.""

He agreed that he should have done so right away and said he would sort it out after work today. 

Now I'm just waiting and wondering what to think. His ex sent me another message today explaining an idea for a tattoo that he has been thinking about but hasn't gotten yet. How would she know that unless he had told her on his own? That means, at best, he had lied to me about the length of their conversation at the pub. At worst he lied to me about all of it and had in fact cheated on me that night. Either way he's lying and I know that for a fact now. Nowhere on social media has he posted about his tattoo idea. He hasn't even told his friends because it has to go with their group and he wanted to surprise them. 

I was the only one he had told. Until now I guess. 

What should I do? This is so draining. 

**tl;dr** He says that she just wants to break us up and insists that it's all a lie. But a few details suggest otherwise. Not sure what to think or how to feel. This is such a shock to me."
13,"UPDATE: Me [28F] with guy [37F] I've been seeing for 1.5 months, didn't disclose he had HSV-2


 [Original post](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/cds57v/me_28f_with_guy_37f_ive_been_seeing_for_15_months/)

&amp;#x200B;

So, I cut him loose. It wasn’t easy because I saw myself falling for him before all this, which rarely ever happens, but it *was* easy because while I’m very open and understanding, on a list of like 3 things I know I stand for, this was one of them.

&amp;#x200B;

It also wasn’t just that he didn’t tell me prior to being intimate (which I do think is already a deal breaker for a lot of people), but that he had ample opportunity to address it afterwards. His reaction to me telling him I would have preferred to be informed prior to getting involved physically also felt dismissive, especially after I feel he was already in the wrong for disclosing it late. He said it wasn’t a big deal, and that he should’ve told me before but it was hard, etc. Even if he had just apologized sincerely then, acknowledged the error of his ways (or at least given a thorough explanation of why he made those choices), and sat down with me to address my feelings, that would have made a world of difference.

&amp;#x200B;

All in all, I didn’t feel this was someone I could pursue an equal and respectful relationship with. I took some time to write a message that stated my opinion while being compassionate, but I was firm and didn’t leave it open-ended. I want him to know that I think his course of action (not limited to his initial omission) is unacceptable, in hopes he reflects on this when he faces the next opportunity to inform someone or not.

&amp;#x200B;

His response was that he “has some opinions but doesn’t feel there’s room for discussion. Sorry.” I can’t even tell if that’s an apology to me, or if he’s just sorry he can’t express himself. Normally I’m very interested in hearing other perspectives, but I don't think I’ll waste further time or energy concerned about the feelings of someone who hasn't shown that same regard for me. A little disheartening, but trying to focus on knowing I did the right thing in terms of honoring my own self-respect, and for all other people who deserve to not have that choice taken away from them. Frankly, I could’ve torn him a new one but chose to approach it with empathy, and I’m happy I responded in line with my values and just have to accept his actions at face value. Anyways, back to the ol’ drawing board!

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR! Broke up with him because him thinking it's okay to make a decision of that magnitude for me doesn't bode well for the future. Also, so he reconsiders his actions and hopefully makes better choices for future partners."
14,"My (30F) best friend of 10+ years (31F) didn’t show up to my wedding because of mental health issues and I don’t know how to move forward with our friendship.


TLDR: She didn’t show up to wedding because of social anxiety and has been in a decline for the last two years. I have tried to be patient but am upset she wasn’t there for something so important to me. I don’t know if I’m being a shitty friend for being upset with her.

Sorry for how long this is. 

My best friend (T) and I met in college and have been best friends for over a decade since. We were so tight knit that even though we have lived in cities 5 hours apart from each other we would take turns visiting each other every month and would text every day and have hours long phone calls at least twice a month. About two years ago T started going downhill mental health wise. She has a very stressful job in a very male dominated field and the stress plus the constant institutionalized sexism cause a series of issues that has resulted in her being put on medical leave for the last four months.

Over the past two years, we haven’t been able to see each other much because she hasn’t been able to come up and visit me. I have totally understood this and still visited her at least four times a year. Since she has since stopped calling and texted me as much as well. Which I understood was due to her mental health issues so I just try to be as supportive as I can and maintain my level of commitment to our friendship.

Her decline in mental health has almost perfectly aligned with my engagement and marriage which has been tricky for our friendship. When we got engaged, I immediately asked T and three other friends to be bridesmaids. I never designated a maid of honor because I wanted them all to equally be responsible for duties and didn’t want one person to feel like they were so stressed out with wedding stuff. As a bride, I tried my best to not ask for much. I really only asked that they buy a dress for the wedding and shoes. 

When we picked a date for the wedding she told me that per their jobs, she and her boyfriend were not allowed to ask for time off. So while it wasn’t the only factor, we did pick July 4th as the date for the wedding because we knew that she would definitely have that day off. This was something she knew because I asked her several times if she would be able work with that date.

For the bachelorette party we went to Nashville. I had a text chain running with my other bridesmaids to pick a date and work through other logistics and T was just not responding to anything. When we did pick a date it was right after she was put on medical leave so I sent her a long email (she wasn’t responding to phone calls or texts) saying that she shouldn’t feel burdened to attend the bachelorette party and I just wanted her to be healthy and comfortable. She never responded to my email but eventually I heard via my other bridesmaids that she responded to a separate chain that I wasn’t on (so that i would be surprised) and she would be attending and said she could be responsible for planning the Friday night. When T asked what I wanted to do I said we should just go to a bar I liked there and then we should do this scavenger hunt that we did for another friend’s bachelorette.

I want to jump in here and say that at the bachelorette party I paid 2/3 of the Airbnb that we all rented and ask the girls to evenly split the rest. I very carefully selected restaurants to eat at that would be affordable and booked every meal. I picked out the bars to go to and I also picked out the activities. I basically did as much planning as I possibly could and ask very little of my bridesmaids for this.

T did nothing for that Friday night at all. She didn’t print out a scavenger hunt, she didn’t even find one we could do on our phones even though an hour before I said “why don’t you just find an app for it or something.” After the bachelorette party she texted me and said she was sorry about it, and I told her it wasn’t a big deal – we had a great time and that’s all that matters.

After this the next time I saw her was her birthday when my Fiancé and I drove down to visit her. We were there for 2 nights/3days and each night she would pass out at about 7, leaving my Fiancé and I to twiddle our thumbs before going to bed 4 hours later. Her boyfriend was busy studying for a very important exam and couldn’t entertain us.

We had been in moderate communication since then and up until the wedding and it seemed like everything was fine. The night before the wedding the bridesmaids were supposed to come over to the hotel for a rehearsal and then spend that night in my suite so that they would be ready to go for hair and makeup in the morning. I get a facebook message at about 3PM from T’s brother saying that he wasn’t sure what was going on, but that I needed to call T’s father and gave me his phone number. I immediately call T’s Father and he tells me that T is incoherent, and he will be checking on her and doing what he can, but there is no way she was going to make the 4PM rehearsal. I told him thank you for letting me know and to keep me updated on her condition and let me know if there is something I can do.

I get a text from her later that night apologizing for not coming to the rehearsal and saying that she would understand if I wanted to take her out of the wedding. I told her I hope she was feeling better and I would love for her to still be in the wedding and it’s not like rehearsals are that important anyway. The next time I hear from her it the day of the wedding. I get a call at 9:30 AM from her and when I answer she is incoherently crying and then just hands the phone off to her mom.

Her mom tells me that T’s social anxiety is so bad and she won’t be able to come to the wedding. I say ""is there anything we can do to get her here?"" And her mom tells me no. T’s family and T’s boyfriend were supposed to come to the wedding as well. So I ask if they will still be coming and her mom tells me no they needed to stay with T. I just tell her I have to go at this point and give my phone off to another bridesmaid and tell her I can’t deal with any other bad news today (there had been unrelated huge drama leading up to the day already).

The wedding went off great and we still managed to have a great time, but her absence was noted by many people especially because it was an intimate wedding of 60 people. Well now 55 since neither her nor her family showed up. I didn’t hear from her again until 2 days later when she texted and asked if I could call her because she wanted to explain to me what happened. I didn’t respond at the time because we were on our honeymoon. But I really don’t know what to do. It’s been over a week since the wedding and I only have gotten the one text from her.

I know mental health issues make things like weddings difficult and I really want to be empathetic but the more I think about it, the more selfish I think her actions are. She could have said she only could do the ceremony and then left during the reception. She could have sent her boyfriend or some of her family there to be an ambassador. She could have texted me more than once to apologize. There are lots of things she could have done but hasn’t. I’m really hurt that the woman I thought was my best friend wasn’t there on the most important day of my life. I’m just really sad that she wasn’t there. I don’t know how to forgive her or move forward with our friendship. But at the same time I worry that if I don’t she will become even more mentally unstable. I don’t want to be the cause of her going through even more mental health issues.

I just feel like I’ve been patient and kind through all of her stuff. I have tried so so so hard to be a good friend to her. And she has been a good friend to me so many times through the years. But I just have hit a limit. Am I being a bad friend to be upset with her?"
15,"I (31F) have been with my boyfriend (39m) for 5 years, bought a ring together 1 1/2 yrs ago and he still has not proposed. Am I being a nagging girlfriend if I put an ""end date"" on it?


My boyfriend and I have been together 5 years and we have a great relationship.  After a lengthy discussion he and I bought a ring together on an exciting day out in Miami a year and 7 months ago.  This ring was 100% an engagement ring. After 6 months of having the ring and no engagement, I asked him what was going on.  He had some excuse about not being about to figure out a good way to propose.  

&amp;#x200B;

Am I ""THAT"" nagging girlfriend if I bring this up again and ask for a timeline of when he thinks he'll ""have the proposal planned""?

&amp;#x200B;

My issue is- on one side, I don't want to be the nagging girlfriend

&amp;#x200B;

On the other side, I cannot continue to stay in a relationship where I am being strung along. I don't think it has anything to do with the planning of the proposal.  He SWEARS he definitely wants to get married.  

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR- Boyfriend and I together 5 yrs.  Bought a ring together and we've had it for a year and 7 months.  Still no proposal."
16,"How can I avoid being the “mother” in my relationship?


I (39F) am at my wits end and am turning to the internet for advice.  I find myself in the role as “mother” to my husband (35M) and I hate it completely and thoroughly.  

I have been desperately trying to understand how I came to be in this role.  It was absolutely not what I wanted in my life.  And since I came to the realization I have made every effort to stop offering suggestions, guidance, assistance, “nagging”, and reminders and then I’m a jerk, being passive aggressive. 

When I do any of those things I am seen as a commander and demanding person.  I cannot win.  I can chose to be a “mother” or I can chose to be a roommate.  I can find no middle ground or happy medium.  Either I sit back and watch the world burn or I step in and run 100% of the show. And none of it is by choice. 

What could I be doing better?

I don’t mention: dishes, bills, chores, or care for the children at all.  I either do it all myself (quietly) or it doesn’t get done.   I say “quietly” because I have really tried very hard not to nag, ever.

When a responsibility is finally remembered by my husband I get the ever lovely:  why didn’t you tell me to do this?    (Pfft right, so I can be told): Jeeze mom stop telling me what to do!

I tried simply mentioning the task and not getting involved.  For that I have to hear about how I didn’t help.  If I help in anyway I hear about how if I wanted it done a certain way I should have just done it myself.  (But you asked me to show you how)

Now in my attempt to end this misery, I have pretty much completely shut down.  I go out of my way to speak to him as little as possible, as every conversation is full of landmines.   Every argument, and I mean every argument ends with:  it’s because you’re always acting like your my mom.   So I avoid it at all costs.

A silly example if it helps:   I have taken the flack for doing my husbands laundry.  Specifically, not putting things away in HIS preferred location.  So I stopped doing that and instead I would  give him reminders about his laundry needing to be done, and I was told to that he doesn’t need to hear his mom tell him about his laundry.  So I stopped that.  Naturally he has no clean clothes and I was told BOTH:  why didn’t you just do my laundry for me and also:  why didn’t you remind me or warn me I was running out of clothes!   

I find myself just staring at him in complete shock and confusion, considering it wasn’t too long ago when he got mad at me for either doing it, reminding him to do it, showing him how to do it, and/or not doing anything at all and letting the task get out of hand. 

Apply this example to every task you can imagine in your daily life:  oil changes, his personal bills, grocery shopping, putting toilet paper in the bathroom.  All of these things are treated the same:  either I do it all OR it will not get done. 

None of it makes sense and I really just don’t know my way out of this box.   

How can I avoid being “mom” as well as avoid being the only human doing the work?  Is there a magic phrase that will work while also avoiding an argument.? 

Anything “gentle” and not “motherly”  or passive aggressive I can say or do?

Td;lr:  I don’t want to be seen as the mom and I don’t know how to avoid it anymore."
17,"I (25m) am struggling to find my girlfriend (24f) attractive


TL;DR I've met a girl who I think is amazing, but I'm struggling with finding her physically unattractive.

We met about six months ago, through online dating. We immediately had incredible chemistry. I'd never met someone who I related so well to, or someone who was so fun to talk to and be around.

I mean, this girl is really, really awesome. She cracks me up. She's incredibly articulate. She's kind and present and very much the kind of person I can see a future with.

However, I'm not attracted to her. This wasn't important to me at first (""personality is more important"") but as we spend more time together it's incredibly becoming an issue. Our sex life is declining rapidly, I'm having to force physical affection, compliments feel hollow, or forced. It's small things, unconscious things, but it's been affecting me.

I know this post makes me come off as a shallow asshole. I don't have a good defense. And it's not like I can communicate my issues to her. She isn't overweight, and she's very insecure about her looks.

I can't seem to find a solution. And I can't stress enough how awesome this girl is. Has anyone dealt with this before?"
18,"I(20F) don't think my boyfriend(21M) appreciates what I do for him.


My boyfriend and I have been together for about a year. Everything was great for the most part of the relationship.
We had our disagreements,of course,but I always felt appreciated. 
He was  eager to please me and always considered my feelings. I never had to worry about expressing myself as I did with my past lovers. Everything came naturally.

 I was the same. Got him small gifts,always supported him emotionally,helped with his studying,just to name a few.

I was always surrounded by unhealthy relationships so I made it my goal that he knows just how much he means to me. 
I communicate as much as I can,even if its really hard for me sometimes.

I never felt this connected to a person before.
We are quite young and I have no intention of getting married until Im 30,so I never thought he was ""the one"", but I just though that even if we broke up,we would still stay great friends.

We are both in medschool. 
Im always stressed and I study more than is probably healthy. That means we dont see eachother that often,but we make an effort to be together on the weekends,and we have lunch some day during the week.

We had a lot on out plate this exam season,but because of the way I am,I finished all my exams early. He didn't.
He was under a lot of stress,so I gave him space. We reviewed together and I did my best to be there for him to calm him down as much as I can.
Because of this,we haven't seen eachother in almost a month. 
This has never happened to us before. I just dont know how to feel.
I asked him to hang out a couple of times but he always said no. Said he was stressed and just wanted to study. 
I understand. I was like that before my exams too so I didn't take it personally.
But the issue here is that the exams are done now and he still hasn't asked me to see eachother.
Im leaving today for my hometown and wont be back in the city in a month. 

He knows this and yet he doesn't care. 
Ever since he was done with his exams we haven't even been talking. Just some messages throughout the day.

I didn't tell him I was leaving today. My grandma passed away today and I need to just be with my family. I dont even know how hes going to react to the news of my grandmas passing.

Im probably emotional because of the family emergency,but I want my boyfriend to give a damn again.


TL;DR I feel like Im the only person in my relationship because Im the only one making any effort."
19,"How can I (25 F) get my Dad (60s M) tell me who he is?


I (25 F) was raised by my hardworking, kind and quirky single Mom (65 F). Luckily she made sure she could live off on one cushy job, and always found time to give me as much love as she could. Which was always way more than enough. Shes my best friend, and I trust her with my life. She made me the badass woman I am today.

My Dad (60s M) and I have a very different relationship.

Since I was a kid, the only two things I've known about my Dad is his name and face. We speak every so often, and hang out when our schedule permits it. As a kid, we either played video games or watched movies. These days he tries to sell me products that he think will make us rich. My Mom and I know very little about who he is, other than the following:

• He was married before my Mom or during
• He has sons, I've never met
• He is in another relationship, idk who
• Where he works
• I met his Mom when I was 6, but I can barely remember her face
• We both love video games, movies, and playing music
• I met his sister and niece once when I was 13 years old, we don't talk 
• He may have issues with his own family

I dont know much more other than that. It bothers me I look just like him and dont know his address. I know he lives an hour away from me, but I'm not sure where... I dont even know how old he is...

My relationship with my Dad makes me feel ashamed, and rejected since he only hangs out with me when he wants to. I feel so disconnected from him emotionally, yet he loves to give me life advice. 

I have serious trust issues, and would like to stop feeling lied to by the words between us not being shared. 

The time has come that I am going to be in control of this relationship.

When I was 13, I begged him to tell me more about his family. He said he doesnt want me to be hurt by others, but I think he is protecting himself.

Loosing him would break my heart. What scares me the more  is that he could die, I would miss his funeral. 

How can I get him to open up to me? We get along, but I'm not sure its because I act agreeable or if we actually get along.

TL; DR

How do I get my secretive father to open up to me?"
20,"My boyfriend doesn't know if he cheated or not


Throwaway because he knows my redit handle.

Im not sure what to do here. I've(22F) been with my boyfriend(23M)for almost two years and he was always faithful to me.
 
He's a really attractive guy and there are a lot of people interested in him,but he always notified me whenever someone tried to make moves on him.

It never even crossed my mind that he would cheat on me. 

We have plans to go on a trip together in about a month,to go to France.
We have everything booked and ready. This would be our first time traveling together since we weren't financially stable when we first got together.
So to say we were excited would be an understatement of the year.

Now to start with the issue in hand.
He went out with some friends a couple of days ago. Everyone got smashed.

He doesn't drink usually so I dont think he knew his tolerance level,but thats not really important here.


He sent me some messages at about 3am saying that his mouth hurts and that he isnt sure of he kissed someone or not. Then he went on to say that some girl claims that they kissed. He tried calling me but I was asleep. He then proceeded to leave multiple voice messages about how sorry he was.

I read and listened to it all in the morning and I contacted him via text.
I was extremely hurt.
He didn't seem to be losing interest in me. There was no indication that he was cooling off or that he was even remotely interested in someone else.
I met his parents just recently for gods sake. 

In the morning he didn't remember anything. He has a tendency to black out when he drinks so I believed that. He said that he wasn't talking to any girls that night,but he just wasnt sure.

He asked around and everyone he went out with claims that he was with them the entire time and that there was no girl. 

But they could just be covering up for him.

Some of my friends were in that group,and they say he wasn't doing anything suspicious. 

Im really not sure what to do here.
I really care for him,but I would never cheat,even smashed. And all of that could be just drunk gibberish but that's a really weird thing to make up when drunk.

TL;DR While drunk my bf said he kissed someone else,but now he isnt sure."
21,"Girlfriend wants to break up with me after I got into a car accident and not calling her to see how she was feeling.


Yesterday I got into a car accident. Thank goodness i didn’t sustain any injuries. But my girlfriend (22/f) of 4 months was at her house at the time. I (22/m) was in shock of everything that happened. I told her about the accident and she felt bad and I told her to not worry. She has sever anxiety and depression. so that feeling wasn’t going away. I couldn’t talk with her to tell her about everything because I was dealing with the police, ambulance, and other parties involved in the accident. I called her the next day. And she was very upset because I didn’t realize she was annoyed at me. She wanted to go to the beach but I couldn’t because I had to take care of my car at the shop. And I told her to make other plans. And that I’ll see her tomorrow. Then she said how come I don’t see her today instead. So I said okay I’ll see you instead. She called me out and told me I was being indecisive.  And then she said I don’t care about her feeling and that she wants break up because I treated her like shit. Mind you she didn’t call me the next day. Being that I was the one in the accident, not her. She told me all she wants to do now is grind on guys, make out with other guys, and drink. I’ve done so much for her, and she still says I don’t do enough and that I’m a little and kids and she needs a man. Please Reddit, I need your advise. What should I do? I really love her and don’t want to let her go. 

TL;DR 
-I get into car accident 
- girlfriend believes I don’t care about her 
-Girlfriend then says I’m indecisive when putting off me plans to go see her 
-Girlfriend wants to break up 
-Girlfriend wants to go out and grind on other guys"
22,"My boyfriend (23M) is only affectionate when I (23F) ignore him.


I would say I’m a very affectionate, bubbly, and loving partner in general. I like to always be complimenting my boyfriend, touching him, joking with him, etc.

Lately it seems like he takes longer to respond to my texts, doesn’t compliment me as much, and seems less enthusiastic to be with me. I understand that some people do this when the “honeymoon phase” is over.

Anyways, I kinda decided to try toning myself down and started hanging out more with friends than him, taking longer to respond to not put pressure on him, and generally behaving less “loving” when we’re together (no spontaneous touching, kissing, etc.)

Now he seems like he’s all over me again! He’s always trying to cuddle and touch ME. He asks me to hang out every single day. Overall his attitude seems to be more what I wanted from the start and I’m wondering why.

I _like_ to be warm I’m a relationship so I don’t want to have to act like I don’t forever.

Does anyone know what might be happening here?

Tl:dr Boyfriend gives me more love and attention the less I give him."
23,"I (32F) am such an invisible, useless failure of a wife and mother that my parents celebrate and laugh when my husband (32M) gets mad at me (married 7 years)


My husband is the workhorse of the family. He works his ass off for me and our 6 and 8 year old children. Despite working more hours, he is an incredibly hands-on dad and over the past few years I've noticed that when we are doing things as a family I have slowly let him take over more tasks and 'work'. He is a silly guy by nature, and endlessly patient--so he deals with difficult behaviors much better and the kids respond to this. They like him better. This summer I've really been making a huge effort to make sure my husband doesn't just silently take over tasks and that we work together more and I've been really making sure I'm on the ball and taking initiative. My husband told me he doesn't mind the work balance but won't just start taking over things because he doesn't want me to feel bad. So there's the context.

My husband is such a patient, soft spoken, hands on dad who is so devoted that my dad actually laughs and praises him if he ever gets annoyed with me or tells me he isn't going to comply with a request. It's humiliating and degrading. My husband is talented and skilled and could do anything I do in life better. Honestly. He sews, he fixes things, he builds things, he goes to the gym...hes amazing and nothing I can do compares to him.

&amp;#x200B;

Tonight we had a big fight that has left me feeling like I should just leave. 

&amp;#x200B;

We spent all day at the fun fair an hour away from our home, and when we got back I quickly made the kids a simple meal to get bedtime rolling. 5 minutes after we both sat down my husband asked what my plan was for dinner. I told him ""I haven't gotten that far yet, but I have..."" and I listed 3-4 meal options I could make with the ingredients I had. He looked visibly frustrated and annoyed, sighed loudly, and said, ""Obviously you didn't plan, so I'll just figure it out don't worry about it.""

&amp;#x200B;

I got really defensive and was really hurt by his response. I told him I didn't understand what the problem was, I gave him some options and asked what he would prefer. I was upset. Seeing me upset made him visibly more annoyed and angry with me, which just spurs on my emotional reaction. Now we are having an argument about the way he is treating me and not just about dinner. This is not the first time we've argued about this. 

He is angry that everything is about ""how I feel"" and not about ""what is actually happening"". I told him he may not have intended to be rude or critical of me but his tone of voice, body language, and other signals indicated to me that he was angry and it felt like a critical and unproductive comment to make when I didn't do anything wrong. I didn't have a specific plan for dinner, but I had shopped this week based on exactly this situation and so I had a number of things handy I could throw together to make something healthy and tasty. 

The argument was circular but he eventually expressed his frustration that I didn't have a specific thing that I had decided to make ahead of time, and if he needed to make a meal plan and shopping list he would. He told me he would take over doing that.

&amp;#x200B;

Literally the only thing useful I do in this marriage is make food and shop for the food. Sometimes I have meal plans and sometimes I don't. It cut me deep to hear that my hard working, talented husband could essentially just do my job. I'm not a great housekeeper, the kids don't listen to me, and my husband is so patient and soft-spoken and helpful that my dad actually celebrates if my husband gets annoyed with me in his presence or says ""no"" to a request. My mom has told me that my husband is too nice to me. 

&amp;#x200B;

At this point I'm ready to hire a nanny to come live with my family and just leave. If my feelings don't matter, the way people speak to me doesn't matter, and he could just do everything I do anyway, what is the point of me being around? I feel suicidal for the first time since I was a teenager. I feel utterly useless and like a total failure. My partner can't count on me. I suck at cleaning. I didn't plan for dinner. I'm fucking useless. 

&amp;#x200B;

Where do we even go from here? We aren't speaking to each other. If body language, words, facial expressions, and tone of voice don't matter, then are my feelings just imaginary? Am I allowed to be hurt by the way someone speaks to me? Maybe I misinterpreted his tone, which is understandable, but why do I not get to have a reaction to the way I am spoken to? Why can't that just be resolved with a simple ""Oh I didn't mean it that way, what I meant was...""??? WHAT DO I DO

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR My husband and I got in a fight because: I didn't have a plan for dinner, and I got mad at his response. He says his tone of voice and body language don't matter, and hes tired of having fights about how I feel rather than what's actually happening. Then he offered to take over the last job I have in this marriage that he doesn't do. I feel useless."
24,"My boyfriend's sister (33F) ate all the food in our (29M, 28F) house.


(Boyfriend and I together for over 3 years, living together since January)

So on Saturday me and my boyfriend went to visit some friends out of state, this involved spending the night there and coming back Sunday. His sister recently moved to the area we live in. She agreed to come over to our house Saturday evening and Sunday morning to feed our cat.

Note, we didn't ask her to house-sit. He was clear that what he wanted her to do was just feed the cat. Basically spend 10 minutes tops two times while we were gone. So there's no reasonable explanation for her needing to eat our food, such as because she was staying here overnight or anything like that. 

Well we came back Sunday afternoon to find nearly all our food was gone. Literally everything besides condiments, spices, vegetables, and ingredients that take some cooking effort (chicken, steaks).

2 boxes of mac and cheese. A half-eaten bag of doritos and an unopened one of cheetos. Frozen waffles and fries were popped in the oven. 3 ice cream bars. Mixed nuts. A leftover bowl of spaghetti and meatballs. Orange juice, milk, and soda all finished off. Cheddar cheese from the deli. A few smaller snacks I'm forgetting.

On top of this, she left dirty dishes in the sink, and the trash is full of packaging.

We looked at security cam footage from the front door and saw that both times she came over she stayed two or three hours. There was another time she came back around midnight also for a couple hours.

What the fuck, right. His sister has a history of being rude and entitled, frankly we were surprised she agreed to take care of the cat. Now I wonder if it was just so she could get free food.

When my boyfriend confronted her, she just said she'd pay him back. When he asked why she'd even eat everything in the first place she tried to flip it around on him saying ""you never told me not to!"" What adult doesn't understand it's assumed you don't take people's stuff unless they offer it? She became extremely angry to him. She tried to guilt trip him by saying she'd done us a favor and we were being ungrateful!

She is emotionally volatile in general so we could see the meltdown coming. My boyfriend backed down and decided to drop it. We thought that was the end. Then she made a passive aggressive facebook post about ""people who don't appreciate you"". Now it's possible this was about something else (again, this woman is pretty dramatic with everyone) but given the timing I think it's likely about us. Especially since she added a comment saying something about how people always find fault even when she does a good deed. 

I also highly doubt she will pay us back, she's usually broke. She doesn't have a job yet even though she's been here since April, and didn't work before that either. This food was supposed to last us a week and while we're not broke it's not like we can just shrug it off.

How do we deal with this?

TL;DR: My boyfriend's sister ate our food when we were away. She won't apologize or see she did anything wrong."
25,"[update] How do I tell my friend I don’t want to watch her cats for a year while she travels?


[original post here](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/cdy5y3/how_do_i_tell_my_friend_i_dont_want_to_watch_her/)

I’ve had a few people message me about an update which I was surprised about, but here goes:

I texted Samantha to call me when she had the chance that night. In the text I sent her I plainly stated I wanted to talk about the cats. She called me that night around 7 after she got home from work. 

After reading through most of the replies, I had a pretty good idea about what I wanted to say and how exactly I wanted to word it, as well as some ideas about how to shut down any combative behavior from Samantha’s end. 

So I basically straight up told her something close to “after heavily considering it with (husband) we decided that we will not be able to watch the cats for you. I’m sorry that we didn’t work out for you” I made sure to leave out any language that could give her an opportunity to try to rationalize why we should be able to do it. 

She sighed and asked “why”? I briefly told her “ I don’t think it’s a good idea with the dog, and to be honest a year is way too long for us to feel comfortable committing to care for someone else’s pets” 

She pushed back a little bit but I just kept reiterating “I know that it sucks, if I think of any other options I’ll let you know” 

I also gently suggested boarding to which she replied too expensive, then I said have you thought about rehoming and she said “fuck no” 

Finally she said that she knew finding someone to watch the cats was going to be the hardest part, and that she guesses she will ask her dad, but didn’t want to resort to asking him because she was worried about HIS leather furniture getting ruined. 

So needless to say, everyone was right that she was just trying to take advantage of me and my husband. It’s obvious that this friendship is super unhealthy, and I’ll be continuing to distance myself from now on. 

TL;DR: called her and told her no. Turns out I wasn’t her only option. Friendship is obviously unhealthy, I’ll be distancing myself."
26,"I found my (24F) husband's (25M) secret Instagram account and he blocked me on it


My husband and I have been married for 4 years, together 8. We are best friends and I thought we told each other everything. When he joined the Army I left everything behind to be with him. I did all of this willingly. I wanted more than anything in the world to be with him.


But once I moved in with him things changed. He was always stressed out from work. That was his excuse for having sex with me only 5 times in just our first year of marriage.


Things started getting better over the last few years. But the sex is still far in between. And the romance has dwindled. I feel more like roommates but I keep trying. And he tries too for a while when I bring it up. 


When I bring up the lack of sex his reasons are that hes afraid I'm going to get another UTI (im prone to them no matter what prevention I try but havent had one in 6 months) or that he's stressed. He claims he still finds me attractive and that its nothing Im doing. 



Well last night I initiated sex and our dog kept bothering us. Instead of putting the dog away or moving to a different room, the husband said ""the dog wins."" And just stopped. I left, extremely hurt, rejected, and humiliated. I shut down. I was tired of being rejected over and over. I have extremely low self esteem and it just feels like a stab in the heart every time he rejects me without a proper reason. I went for a walk to cool down and by the time I got home it was after midnight and the husband had made himself a place to sleep in the living room.


During my walk I realized something has to be up and I did something really stupid that I am extremely ashamed of. I snooped on his laptop. I hate that I did this. Because I always thought I trusted him. He's always been respectful towards me. He doesnt check out girls openly in front of me and hes great with boundaries.


I found a secret Instagram on his laptop. He is following over 2,000 naked girls on there. I couldn't tell if he was messaging them because it is the desktop site. I couldnt tell if they were girls he knew in real life because there were so many. I threw up after just looking at a few.


He has only 3 followers and they're real life friends. He has only one post and it's a picture of a deer that we saw on a trail together.


I wondered if he was following me (because he recently deleted his personal Instagram without even telling me) so I looked myself up and yup, I am blocked. 


I feel even worse. Knowing hes probably jacking off to these girls but when I offer myself to him and he rejects me. I have nothing against porn or masturbation. But when he'd rather look at these girls than be intimate with me.... It really hurts.


I don't know if I'm over reacting. But isn't 2000 a lot of naked pages to follow? Isn't that extreme? How do I approach him? I snooped and invaded his privacy. I fucked up doing that. But is it okay what he's doing? 

We are moving back to our home state next week. How am I supposed to do that when I can barely look at him without wanting to cry?


TLDR: sex life isn't frequent with husband. Got rejected by him once again so I looked at his laptop like an idiot and found his secret Instagram where he's following 2000-some naked girl pages. And he has me blocked on there."
27,"[Update] My[26/f] boyfriend[27/m] over-explains everything. How do I approach it?


Update to: [this question. ](https://old.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/bngv4z/my26f_boyfriend27m_overexplains_everything_how_do/)

There was quite a bit of traction on the question and many encouraging answers. For anyone in a similar situation I figured an update might be helpful.

We had a few conversations about how he spoke to me. One time he started getting emotional and then turned it back on himself (how he can't explain himself well) instead of acknowledging how hurtful it was to me. I spent the hour after making him feel cared for and abandoning the goal of the conversation. The second time was much more productive, but nothing changed.

There were other contributing factors (upcoming long distance, difference of hobbies, he wasn't taking care of himself physically [ie. Wouldn't brush his teeth]), but ultimately I broke up with him. It's been 3 weeks now.

There was a lot good in the relationship, he was kind giving, an amazing adventure buddy. But I felt alone, anxious, and like he didn't care to know about me (even though he was a good listener). I need someone who shows active interest.

I cried the day of, but ever since it feels like a weight has been lifted. I've been chatting on some dating apps, and I'm now MUCH more aware of people who just talk about themselves. And I'm having some good conversations, though I haven't met up with anyone yet. I'm hopeful for a partner who will be a little more similar to me in communication.

TL;DR: Broke up with boyfriend who over-explains everything. I feel like an emotional weight has been lifted and I didn't realize how anxious it was making me."
28,"My (27F) fiance (37M) is incredibly angry with me because I broke my toe


I know the title sounds ridiculous, but me breaking my toe had caused some issues to come to a head. 

My fiance and I have been together a year and a half.  We've gone through some tough times together and come out the other end stronger. But yesterday at work, I accidentally pulled a metal door into my foot. My work took me to the doctor, and out turns out I've fractured my big toe. Nothing too major, but I was in a lot of pain and it took five hours to be seen. The doctor there bandaged up my damaged nail and told me to stay home from work Friday. When I was finally able to go home, I called my fiance to let him know what was going on. After telling him about the day, he said ""So let me get this straight. You did this to yourself?"" This made me burst into tears. Probably not the most mature reaction, but it had been a long, rough day. We ended the conversation shortly after. 

I got home about five, and he came home shortly afterwards with a pizza for dinner. He offered to go get a pair of flip flops so I can have a pair of shoes to wear until this bigger bandage comes off. When he gets back from getting the shoes, he is incredibly angry. I ask him what's wrong, and he tells me to just leave him alone and not to talk to him. We spend the rest of the evening in separate rooms, not talking to each other, which is unusual for us. 

That brings us to this morning. He woke up before me, and by the time he got done showering and came into the room to get dressed, I was awake. He asked me what I was going to do today, and I said I didn't know. He accused me of moping because I was hurt, which I disagreed with. We both got a little heated. I said it was unfair to say I was moping when I had just woken up and I was still frustrated by his unexplained anger from the night before. He said I needed to get something accomplished today and not blow the whole day. 

We went into the living room, and I asked why he was so angry the night before. He said that me getting hurt just reminded him of my pattern. For reference, I used to work at the post office until last year. Partially due to some severe harassment from a manager, I experienced a severe episode of major depression and panic attacks that caused me to miss a lot of work. I got FMLA protection and saw a therapist. Even though I had FMLA, management still tried to fire me. They eventually had to offer me my job back, but by then my fiance and I had moved in  together in his city, and we decided I would stay with the job I had gotten there and I would not go back to my city and the post office. Also during the major depressive episode, I got pregnant unexpectedly. We weren't trying, but birth control failure happened, and we decided to keep the pregnancy. I miscarried about 8 weeks along. It was devastating and I'm still not over it. A couple weeks after the first miscarriage, I got pregnant again. We were dumb and didn't realize you could get pregnant before even having a period after a miscarriage. My second pregnancy was lost about 7 weeks in. This of course didn't help my mental health, or allow me to get back to work. It was after the second miscarriage that I moved in with my fiance and got my current job. 

I asked my fiance what he meant when he said my pattern, and he said my pattern of missing work. He brought up all the time that I had missed from the post office. He said me getting hurt at work and having to miss a day showed management I was unreliable, and that he and I have very different philosophies on work ethic. I don't think it's fair to bring up probably the worst period in my life as proof I'm unreliable, and I told him that I didn't get hurt on purpose, that it was an accident. I can accept that I should have been more careful, but accidents do happen sometimes. He left for work and we didn't resolve anything. 

I don't know what to do. I don't like the thought of every time something happens to me, he shows blame or resentment instead of sympathy. If he truly thinks we're so fundamentally different in work ethic and reliability, then this is just going to keep causing issues. Something like this can cause resentment to grow in a relationship, and I don't want that, especially considering we're getting married in about 7 weeks. What should I do here?  How do I resolve this?

Tldr; I fractured my toe at work. My fiance thinks this is a pattern of unreliability at work."
29,"My (16 M) sister (21) wants to bring her boyfriend (23) on our family vacation


First, there is some backstory that needs to be told:

I come from a large family of 9 so whenever we are all out together things are always pretty chaotic. The last family vacation we went on my brother (22) took his girlfriend (22) with us and no one in our family cared. His girlfriend is super nice and just pleasant to be around. She interacts well with our parents and gets along with the rest of our family so there was no issue with her being on our family trip. They are now engaged and will be on their honeymoon during our next vacation so neither of them will be with us. 

My sister wants to take her boyfriend with us but the thing is no one likes him. He has been dating her for over a year but we never even saw him or personally met him until a few months ago. He brings weed into our house and smokes it in our basement. He is a complete stoner and his social skills are terrible. We even caught him stealing my brothers ADHD medicine. My parents don’t even want him in our house. He has no job and doesn’t go to college. He is a complete idiot and no one likes him. My parents don’t want him coming with us, but she keeps pulling the “why was (brother’s girlfriend) allowed to come but (her boyfriend can’t). She has threatened that if she can’t bring her boyfriend she isn’t coming with us. My parents are torn on what to do and it has caused a ton of arguing. I’m interested in hearing what people from an outside perspective have to say.

TL;DR, my sister wants to bring her shot trash boyfriend on our family vacation but our entire family is against it. On our last vacation my brother brought his girlfriend and no one in our family cared. Because of this there has been tons of arguments between my sister and the rest of our family."
30,"I (24F) think my husband (29M) is going to divorce me over Facebook messages I sent in high school. What to do?


Throw away, obviously. I think my husband is going to end things with me, and I'm not really sure what to do next.

My last post was removed because a lack of question. My question is how do I discuss this with him? What can I say that will help him understand that this is not who I am as a person? Or any general advice is welcome as well.

First I want to make it clear that I've always been faithful to him, these messages occurred years before we ever met. We've been together for about 3 and a half years, married for almost 1.

Last night he logged onto my facebook and read messages from when I was in high school. Some of these messages were explicit, however, they were with people I didn't have relationships with. I had never even went out with them, met them, or did anything physically sexual. They were just flirtatious and explicit messages. He woke me up to confront me about them at roughly 4 am last night, and I just deleted them on the spot to avoid him looking at them further. I have no recollection as to what was said, or even who exactly, because it was from 7 or 8 years ago. I never told him about these sexting instances because, well, I never would meet up or do anything with them. I was just being a dumb kid, and I'm not even sure as to why I did it back then. Of course I feel guilty and ashamed now, and my husband has been away at work so we haven't been able to talk much about this. From what he has sent via text message, he clearly doesn't think he can be with me any longer. He's even called me a slut, which really hurts me. He feels lied to, which I can understand because I never told him about these instances. However, I never felt the need to bring them up when talking about past relationships because they were just conversations. He also feels like we don't have any shared values any more, but I want him to understand that values change over time and I'm not the same stupid kid that I was in high school.

Honestly, I'm not sure where to go from here. He'll be off work pretty soon and I know this is something we need to talk about. I just don't really know what to say, and I'm pretty sure our marriage is over because of this. I really don't want things to end, but I don't know how to recover from all of this. Any advice would be appreciated.

Edit: I want to add that he's been a little insecure that we both had the same amount of sex partners prior to getting together (2). Both of his were long term relationships. 1 of mine was long term, and my other one was a 4ish month relationship that I thought was going to be long term. My husband and I met about 2 months after that last relationship and he's always resented my sexual history.

**tldr: I think my husband is going to end things due to explicit facebook messages from when I was in high school. What do I do**"
31,"My(22F) close friend(25M) beat his wife(23F) while I was standing outside their house.


I’d like to start by saying I know I should have called the cops, I honest to god did not think of it in that moment because I was trying to focus on if what I was hearing was correct and I was panicking about going inside and stopping him/helping her. 

My friend B and I have been close for a long time, on and off depending on where I’ve lived in the country. I know him and his wife, J, have had problems in the past and I’ve tried to be there in the ways I can be, offering support and advise. 

I’ve known about B’s temper since I met him. I’ve been around him for smashing phones, totaling cars purposely, threatening suicide, breaking walls. It’s never been directed at me and he seems to have gotten a bit better, and when I asked J years ago if he’s ever touched her violently, she said he’s pushed her once or twice, that’s it. Which I feel extremely stupid for believing, now. 

The other night we were all ready to go out to play pool and J went into their bedroom to get shoes while B followed. I could hear they were having a private discussion, so I yelled that I’d be outside having a smoke. Within about 5 minutes I started hearing screaming and banging, but they were in very small glimpses and I couldn’t tell if it was B just messing around. I listened until I was sure of what I was hearing and I texted J and told her to come down to my car, and texted B and asked him what was happening. I completely froze. 

I finally snapped out of it and headed inside, where B stormed out and I found J in the bathroom panicking/crying/puking. She told me everything, all the stories, times he’s almost strangled her, dragged her by her feet, thrown her into walls. She’s hid in closets, locked herself in cars. He also has about 120 lbs on her. It was clear how much she cares for him and wants to help him and feels sorry for him. I know the feeling, having been in an abusive relationship, myself. 

After some time of us talking and me holding her, B texted me that he was worried of being hit by a car because he walked out and was far from home at 11 pm. I asked what J wanted me to do, go get him and find a place for him to sleep, bring him back, etc. She said to just bring him home, that he’d apologize and beg for forgiveness, and go to bed. I did that and told her we’d talk the next day and to call me if anything happened. 

At breakfast the next day she acted like nothing had happened. She made a few jokes about his temper and asked me how my relationship is, talked small talk. 

I don’t know what to do here. I haven’t answered any of B’s texts, I am sickened by him and have no interest in keeping the friendship, especially after realizing how much of a charmer he is, and why. I’m scared for them, scared for J. If you’ve made it this far and can offer any advice, I really need it. Thank you. 

TL;DR friend beat his wife while i was outside and she opened up to me about his abuse, I don’t know what to do."
32,"My(29) Husband(33) keeps pressuring to have a kid whenever his mom(50+) keeps yelling at him for not having one yet.


We've been married for four years and live with his parents in a small two bedroom city apartment. I've always wanted a kid, even before marriage and so has he. There has been a time where I did grow concerned and scared with getting pregnant and giving birth, but I feel like with the right support I can push through that. That was the first reason we didn't jump on the kid bandwagon. The reason and major issue for me now is money and even healthcare, which is also money.

&amp;#x200B;

Now I work as a home health assistant and even stream on Twitch for a few extra pennies. I'm very hard of hearing and I do have a hearing aid which costs at least $2,000 and I'm currently using a free loaner till I buy a real one. Without the hearing aid I'd struggle with my job, especially since I work with mostly old folk. My husband is a UI designer and has been working with a start up company since before we married. The past two years have been harsh for him and there have been months he'd still do work and not get paid. He's been trying to work on other projects to freshen his resume since his start up company is still under NDA and therefore can't showcase the massive work he's done. At this time we basically can barely feed ourselves. Both of his parents do work as well to help pay for bills. I believe, and I could be wrong, but his parents do not have health insurance and pay out of pocket for the medication they need. My husband does not have health insurance either and I have a crappy coverage for basic needs due to my job, which is why I can't afford the hearing aid just now.

&amp;#x200B;

So the main issue is his mother constantly complains and even degrades my husband for not having a kid. Her main excuse is she's getting old of course, he's the only child, she demands grand-babies, and that I'm getting too old as well to have a baby. So I have always been telling him ""No, not in this apartment and we really don't have the money right now and I'm not even 40 yet."" Lately it's just been getting out of hand to the point I just want to leave and my husband is still barely getting paid. I just don't know how to fully explain to him just how taxing it would be and with our situation now it's convincing me even more to not even have a kid at all.  


  
TL:DR; Husband's mother demands grand-babies and I keep pointing out we're broke living with his parents in a crappy apartment."
33,"Boyfriend (27m) never wants to sleep over at my place and instead wants me (24f) to sleep over at his place all the time.


We have been dating for 2 years. When we started dating I lived at home since I was still a student-- however earlier this year in January I graduated and moved out into my own place. It's bigger than his and nicer than his. We never started having sleepovers until I moved out. 

Anyways he never wants to stay over at my place. When he does come over after work he leaves after a few hours. He rarely spends the night. Probably since January he has spent 5 nights at my place. 

I am constantly driving over to his place to stay over. We live 15 minutes away from eachother but i still think it's not fair that I always have to drive over to his place. What's so wrong about my place?

I've asked him and he always has a different excuse... ""My place is the sleepover place"" , ""you don't have video games"" , ""I don't have a change of clothes"" . I'm always going out of my way and packing my bag to be at his place. I don't think it's fair. 


What do you guys think I should do. It's actually pretty annoying because I don't get why he doesn't want to stay over.

34,"Boyfriend (M26) got a ring tattooed on his finger.. We’re not married.


So this came as a bit of a surprise. I am in a long distance relationship with a man who I love very much and definitely see a future with. 

We have known each other for years but have been in a relationship for about 7 months. I know it is quick, but we have spoken about marriage and we are certain we will get married to each other in the future.

 He wants to marry me as soon as possible. I on the other hand want to wait a couple of years and he is of course fine with that as he knows I am not ready just yet. 

Recently he got a tattoo on his wedding finger so that it looks like a wedding ring. Yes it’s definitely real. 

He told me that it is his way of showing his commitment to me, and others, especially women that he is taken, and that women would know that he is committed to somebody without asking. (He gets quite a bit of attention from women lol. And no he’s definitely not married to anyone else)

I don’t really know how to feel about it. I love him and I think the gesture is lovely but maybe a bit much. What would you think if your partner did this?


TL;DR My boyfriend (M26) of 7 months got a ring tattooed on his finger to symbolise his commitment to me (F22). Not sure how to feel."
35,"My best friend [26F] may have been lying about a lot of things to me [25M], least of all cancer.


TL;DR After years of 'strange' coincidences, behaviour and (perhaps) an inconsistent cancer story, I don't know if I've realised my best friend has a lot of issues or if I've read far too much into everything.

  
Hey everyone! I’m using my throwaway for obvious reasons. Not sure if this is the right subreddit to post this in – if it is, great. If not, then please let me know. Also, a bit a long read – I struggle with leaving out detail!

&amp;#x200B;

So just a quick background. I got to know the other person, let’s call her Betty, around 10 years ago through mutual friends. We saw each other every so often through high school and university but we only became really close friends around 3 years ago. Towards the end of university, I’d begun developing strange symptoms of a mystery illness that took a lot of time to treat (ruling out what it wasn’t, multiple tests and trying out different medications). This has relevance to the story! 

Like every friendship, there’s things you like about the other person and things that you don’t but aren’t much of an issue and you never really think too much about. 

&amp;#x200B;

However.

&amp;#x200B;

I first began to suspect something strange when I once had to cancel plans at the last minute. I’d begun a new medication and it had knocked me out cold to the point that I awoke an hour after I was supposed to meet a group of friends, Betty included. I apologised, explained and everyone was cool about it. A week later, we’d planned to head for a drink but by strange coincidence Betty had fallen asleep and woke up an hour later. I was a little offended but she insisted that it was not a dig at me.

A few months later, Betty had wanted to make plans but I could not due to relatives coming from out of town and told her several weeks in advance. We rescheduled for the next weekend and just as I had just gotten into my car to pick her up, she called to tell me that some relatives had shown up unannounced and that she wouldn’t be able to stick to our plans.

The next time that I can recall was when I had to cancel a class that we were taking one week for a hospital appointment. The next week. Yep you guessed it. She cancelled too.

There were numerous occasions spread out of a couple of years where these ‘strange’ coincidences occurred. Only in hindsight did I come to realise how many there were.

&amp;#x200B;

Now I come to the main part. I’ve already mentioned that I had a mystery illness/condition take hold a while back. I never really speak too much about it to friends, I’d just rather their acknowledgment of it than their sympathies and understanding that sometimes I can’t take part. Meeting someone new, they’d never tell that anything was going on.

So, I feel awful for ever suspecting that Betty would ever make up something like this. I may be completely wrong, but my gut is telling me otherwise.

&amp;#x200B;

Just under two years ago, whilst I was having regular appointments, Betty told me that she’d been feeling unwell and shortly after that her doctors had discovered that she had cancer of the bowel and she’d known for a short while and had not told anybody. I was devastated that she was going through such a thing and ‘alone’ at that. From then on myself and a few other friends focused on keeping her spirits up and making sure her support base was as strong as could be.

But alarm bells began to ring once more. I confess also that it was only in hindsight that I’d pieced these things together.

The first issue I had was that she had not told her family because she did not want to worry them and wanted to take care of it without them knowing. This was confused further by the fact that she was having private medical treatment under her father’s company’s medical cover (here in the UK, we have the NHS as a first course of action). Surely, would her father not see this?

The next issue was that she stated that she started chemotherapy. I have to accept that she may have wanted to remain quiet on this matter but from what she did say, her chemotherapy seemed very irregular. From what I can tell, chemotherapy is administered very regularly for a minimum of 2-6 weeks at the minimum. However, according to Betty, she would single treatments every few weeks. Anticipating hair loss, she cut her usually long hair very short and complained about how little hair she now had.

Then came her surgery. She didn’t allow any friends to visit her in the hospital neither before nor after the surgery and stated that it was something she had to do alone. Again, something I could respect. But is it not hospital standards to have a next-of-kin to contact should something go wrong? Betty had said she had not told her family. She was also discharged the following day. For such a serious operation, should she not remain under observation for a while longer? 

Two days later, she had joined myself and another friend at a bar and also had a drink. She was visibly in a small amount of pain, but I would have expected that she should have been confined to rest and recovery for at least a week or two?

The last issure that comes to mind is that part of her medication doesn't make any sense to me. She has told me on several occasions that she takes Flucloxacillin regularly but having worked in a medical field for several years, I can't find any reason why she would be taking an antibiotic prescribed usually for short course treatment of skin infections, for anything related to her cancer.

&amp;#x200B;

For several years Betty has expressed her desire to lose weight for various reasons, namely health and aesthetic reasons. I hate to let my mind wander, but I believe that she may have undergone an elective gastric surgery considering that she has been exercising, eating healthily and making the results known a lot in the past year.

&amp;#x200B;

I apologise for the very long post. 

The history of strange coincidences and things not adding up in her story have filled me with doubt

I know that talking to my friend is the only way I will be able to find a more definite answer. I’m just unsure as to how to go about it or if I even should for that matter. Any input from other viewpoints would greatly be appreciated!"
36,"My friend (f/24) wants to leave her abusive, cheating husband - she has two kids (2 &amp; 6 months) with him- and wants to find a new place with me


So my friend is a wonderful, caring girl. She unfortunately, is married to an abusive, cheating, gaslighting ex marine 

He’s had a lot of childhood/life problems/ got blown up by an ied and is in therapy (none of which excuses his aggressive behaviors)

My friend reached out this morning that she knows he went to cheat on her before work 

She found out he made a fb account she didn’t know about, and messaged multiple girls - girls he’s cheated with on the past and other potential girls. Asking for threesomes, etc 

So my question is- if I move in with her is it going to be a mess?

I want to help her and be there for her. She’s too young to be dealing with this bullshit, she’s beautiful and smart - 

But I’m single and smoke weed and don’t have kids 

So the main concerns are: me trying to date, still be free but at the same time live with a single mom with two very young kids - and if her husband will be crazy or anything like that 

I’m not sure what to do. I love to help and we’d totally get along but I’ve never had a roommate with kids, so just wanted to hear different opinions

Tl:dr - my friend wants to leave her cheating, abusive husband, has two kids, and wants to move in with me"
37,"My (27f) girlfriend lied to me about doing cam girl work


Tldr gf originally told me she wanted to do some cam girl work but then said she had decided not to. I logged into her computer with the web browser still open on her account for a cam site then lied to me when I questioned her. 

So my gf and I have spoken about her doing cam model stuff in the past but she always told me she wanted to do non nude stuff and just stick to the flirty side of it (I didn't know that kind of can model work was a thing until she showed me the site she wanted to sign up to and the rules around it) anyways she told me she decided against it and a year has past and I've not thought anything of it until I logged into our PC and she had left the web browser open with her log in details for her account which I was quite taken back by so even though I probably shouldn't have I dug a little deeper and she has been doing full nude shows and messaging guys and never told me. I have brought it up with her and she's trying to tell me she only done it once but I know she is lying and now I'm confused and don't know how to feel as we spoke about her possibly doing it and I was ok with it as she had spoken to me about it but then kept it from me when she told me she had changed her mind"
38,"My (25/M) girlfriend (29/F) hit me across the face last night for continuing to associate with a friend (27/F) of mine that she doesn't like and doesn't trust around me and my other friends just kind of watched it happen without saying a word before or after.


We've been together for two years. It's the same old story. She wasn't like this at the start but slowly her insecurities and all of that started coming out. I've talked to her about her controlling behaviour in the past. About a year and a half ago. She said she didn't like that I was so close to one particular friend of mine who happens to be a girl. I explained that I'm allowed to me close to any number of friends that I want and that she is also allowed to do that, because that's normal ... and because we're not living in stone age. It shouldn't matter if this friend is a girl but to my girlfriend, it matters quite a lot apparently. 

As far as this friend is concerned, we don't hang out one-on-one and we don't really contact each other outside of the ten person group chat where all of our other friends are also included in the conversation. In fact she had a boyfriend until a few months ago. A guy she was engaged to marry and still loves a lot even though they couldn't make it work. 

We were at a dinner party this past weekend. My girlfriend was also there and everything was okay at first. But as soon as I went up to open the bottle of wine that I brought with me, which was located in the kitchen where that particular friend was on a work-related call, my girlfriend snapped a look at me so fast, it was a miracle her head didn't go flying off in my direction. I ignored it because ... well, what else can I do in that situation? Wait for my friend to finish her work call and then go up to open the wine bottle so that we're not alone in the kitchen at the same time for ten seconds? That's insane. If my girlfriend is that worried that something's going to happen in ten seconds, she could very well have risen from her chair and followed me to help out. 

Instead she came bolting into the kitchen as I was opening the bottle (my friend still on the phone) and put her hands on her hips and just looked at me as if I had done something wrong. When I asked if she could hand me the wine glasses on the counter she ignored the question and continued staring at me, really hard. My friend eventually ended her call and just sort of awkwardly stood there for a second before trying to squeeze past so she could return to the table (and give us some privacy for the oncoming argument that was clearly going to take place in three, two ...) but my girlfriend blocked her path and glared at her, too. 

That was when I put the bottle down and asked my girlfriend if she wanted to speak to me in the hallway. She said okay and my friend was given a way out. About five seconds into the conversation my girlfriend was already shouting at me, loudly enough that my friends could obviously hear from the dining room. She kept saying things like, ""Are you trying to embarrass me? Why would you isolate yourself with her when you know how I feel about the friendship? You don't see the way she looks at you. When you're a little older you'll get it. Why don't you take me seriously when I tell you how this makes me feel? How hard is it to just drop her? Is that important to you? Why can't you stand with me on this? If any of my friendships made you uncomfortable, I would at least distance myself from those people."" 

When I reminded her that this friend is already quite distant from me and that we don't hang out alone and that we don't really speak outside of group situations, she pretended like she couldn't hear me and carried on. To be fair she was a bit drunk by this point. But that's no excuse for what happened later. 

I apologized for making her uncomfortable (even though I didn't have to) and then I asked her nicely if we could go back to the table and just end the night on a good note. She said she didn't want to because everyone had obviously heard her shouting at me. When I asked if I could at least go back and tell them that we were going to leave early, she said okay. I went back to the dining room to speak to them and she went over to the door to put on her coat and shoes. Admittedly, I took a little longer than I probably should have explaining to my friends that we were leaving. I didn't say it was because of her but they all knew it anyway. 

When that one friend said, ""Tell her it's okay and bring her back. Let's just all have some wine and enjoy tonight,"" I guess my girlfriend heard it. She sent me a string of text messages asking me to hurry up and asking why that one friend thinks it's okay to even utter her name. I fully didn't understand why she was so deeply upset. But I knew it was better to leave than to bring our drama into the dinner party. I said bye to my friends and went over to the door and unbeknownst to me until a couple of seconds later, three of my friends followed me to the door to try and convince us to stay. My girlfriend started crying and assumed that I had intended to embarrass her and that I asked my friends to come along. She dug her fingers into my arm and tried to pull me through the door. When I yanked my arm back (because it hurt and because my coat and shoes weren't even on yet) she stumbled a few steps and looked at me in shock and then slapped me across the face. 

Hard. 

Somehow all of my friends were there now. They all saw it. No one said anything. I looked at my girlfriend in shock. Never in any of my relationships have any exes of mine ever hit me. Not once. I couldn't believe it. I just stood there for a second waiting for to apologize, and she did, but I was done by then anyway. I put my coat and shoes on and walked right past her and drove myself home. She had her phone and bag on her and is capable of calling a cab. At that point I didn't give a single fuck. 

Since then I've talked to my friends and they're all just like, ""She seemed really sorry. Maybe give her another chance. It's not that big of a deal. Look at how small she is."" One of them agreed with me that it was wrong and asked if I was okay. The friend that my girlfriend doesn't like. I get that because I yanked my arm away, my girlfriend could have drunkenly confused that as something aggressive and then reacted in defense. But hitting someone in the face is never okay. That's disrespect ... nothing else. And the only reason that I had yanked my arm away was because she had grabbed onto it and tried to pull me through the door before I was ready. To me *that's* aggressive. 

It's been two days. I haven't said a word to her but she has sent me a string of text messages saying sorry and telling me that she's going to try and work on her insecurities in therapy. That's great if she wants to do that. But she can do that on her own. I don't have to be there in support. Although I haven't ended it yet, I will when I'm ready to speak to her again. 

What's more fucked up to me is the way in which nearly all of my friends have reacted to the situation. Just because I'm a guy, they think it's okay and that I should give her another chance. As if she hadn't destroyed the dinner party all on her own. Over something that doesn't exist. 

I really don't know what to do about my friends. This is a lot to process. 

**tl;dr** There's nothing going on with this friend. My girlfriend has slowly been letting her insecurities come through in the two years we've been together. After hitting me in the face, I'm pretty much done with her and I don't feel about it. But the way my friends are reacting, telling me that it's not a big deal and that she's small anyway, is what truly bothers me. I don't know what to do about them. The only friend that thinks it was wrong of my girlfriend to hit me is the same friend that she doesn't like."
39,"My [21F] boyfriend [19M] was abused by his mother [43F] while growing up, I think she’s now doing the same to her younger son [17M] and I’m unsure if I should say something.


So I’ll list all the ages first so there will be no confusion.
I am [21F], my boyfriend is [19M], his mother is [43F], and his little brother is 17. 

I started dating my boyfriend 2 years ago and it has been great since, I really am in love with him. He didn’t tell me about his situation until a few months ago. He’s traumatized and I had to help him findprofessional help because he was suffering too much. I did noticed how inappropriate she would act around her kids when I had barely met my boyfruend, but I never thought she would go as far as to actually br doing stuff to them. 

My boyfriend told me that she forced him to have sex with her when he was younger and that it had only stopped when he started dating me. Then I started noticing how wierd she acts around her son more because she is doing the exact same things to his little brother that she did to him. She talks so inappropriately to him, she tells him stuff like “he won’t need a girlfriend with her around” and she touches him all over with no shame or anything. 

She even makes him sleep in the same bed with her and it’s disgusting. I’ve kind of confronted her before, like she was acting all wierd and I told her that how she acted around her kids wasn’t normal. Then she gave me a bs excuse that she never got any attention growing up with her parents and that she just wanted to spend time with her kids. Should I get more involved and say something about it?


Tldr; my boyfriend’s mother abused him and forced him to have sex with her when he was younger and I think that she is doing the same to her brother. Should I say something?"
40,"Breaking up with my boyfriend because of genetic disease and zero compromise for risk to future children


I posted this in the AITA subreddit but broke their rules for discussing relationships but really need advice on this topic. 

My boyfriend of just over 2 years told me that his dad has recently started exhibiting symptoms of Huntington’s disease which he did not tell me ran in his family until now. He told me that his dad never got tested because his cousins that had Huntington’s died in their 30’s and he’s now in his 50’s but this disease can present at different times.  My boyfriend said he never told me about his family’s history of Huntington’s because he never believed it would be a problem for him since his dad never exhibited symptoms. His dad will be getting a test to confirm if the symptoms are Huntington’s on Monday but if it turns out that he does have the disease (which is very likely) my boyfriend said he doesn’t want to get the test done for himself because he doesn’t want to be given an early death sentence. 

My main issue with the whole situation is the high likelihood of passing this disease onto my children. Huntington’s disease is an autosomal dominant disorder, meaning there is at least a 50% chance of my kids inheriting this disease. Huntington’s is a very aggressive disease and a horrible way to go and I morally refuse to have kids if I know that I have a great chance of passing on a debilitating disorder to them. My boyfriend said that he doesn’t care if there is a risk of giving his kids a life altering disease as long as he can reproduce biologically; he won’t adopt or do IVF for a healthy child. 

Overall, I feel lied to and I don’t want to spend my life with someone without knowing when they will begin to deteriorate and that has a completely different moral compass that me. I feel terrible for his father and I can’t imagine knowing what it would be like to live with the possibility of having this diagnosis but I feel like there has been a breech of trust on his part for never sharing this news about Huntington’s on his dad’s side with me. If he has Huntington’s, I will also have to be his nurse potentially in 10-20 years and if we gambled with kids, I would likely outlive them as well and the entire situation has just become unbearable.  I feel overwhelmed and that the person I thought I knew is not the same at all. 


TL;DR - My boyfriend’s dad has been exhibiting symptoms of Huntington’s meaning my boyfriend likely has the disease as well and will pass it onto our future children but will not consider IVF/adoption to protect their health and future.  In 2 years of dating, he never mentioned his family had Huntington’s until a few weeks ago."
41,"I'm (17m) scared my dad (50m) doesn't love me anymore.


My dad and I have always been really close. I'd say closer than most people with their parents. He's always been my best friend. He was supposedly infertile from cancer treatments but then my parents had me. I'm his only kid. I've always been his miracle boy. I grew up with him telling me I was special, a gift from God to him, etc because of his poor health. (Still not good but I help where I can when he lets me)

Well I don't know the exact details but from listening to their fights I think it was found out that my mom has been cheating on my dad on and off for years.

My dad wanted a DNA test on me and we went and had it done. We got the results about a month ago. He left when we found I'm not his. I've been calling and texting him every day. I told him I don't want him gone. I don't want to ever know my bio dad and I just want him to come home or come get me. I have no idea where he is. He has not answered anything. I can hear my mom fighting with him on the phone sometimes. So I know he's not dead. My mom says he's as good as to us now. I don't want this to be true. I don't even like my mom and I hate her for what she's done. I want to go wherever my dad is.

I'm scared he's never going to talk to me again. I don't know what I'm supposed to do without him. I don't understand why he'd turn his back on me like this. I feel betrayed by both my parents. I don't get how he can just forget about me or act like I don't exist. I would never do that to him. HES MY DAD!!! 

I don't know what to do. What the hell do I do? How do I get him to talk to me?


TLDR: my dad isn't my bio dad and I don't know how to get him to talk to me again. How do I get him back?"
42,"My [23M] Girlfriend [22F] of three years is obsessed with fitness.


To clarify, my girlfriend is obsessed with my fitness. As a former cross country runner in both high school and college, I've always been in shape. Moreover, I have a deeply ingrained love for running and working out. 

&amp;#x200B;

Now, all those years of running show in my somewhat small frame. I should say ""showed."" After one year of dating my girlfriend, she confided in me that she was attracted to physically bigger guys. She told me she was attracted to muscles and that she needed me to focus on my body. She straight out told me she didn't find me attractive. I should have left at this point. But, I stayed. 

&amp;#x200B;

As you can imagine, that one year of dating was absolutely lackluster in terms of intimacy. Else, our relationship was, and is, amazing. We share many commonalities, goals, and dreams. It really does seem like an amazing relationship. It was because I valued the relationship that I decided to hit the gym. At first, I won't lie, I did it to fulfill my girlfriend's desires. After I started noticing the results, however, I became dedicated to religiously lifting. 

&amp;#x200B;

After two years, the results are clearly noticeable. I went from 5'11"" and 140 lbs to 178 lbs. I'm extremely happy with the results. If I dare say myself, I look great. At this point, I would think my girlfriend would be all over me. After all, I have the muscles she's always desired. And, even though, our intimacy has improved she keeps talking about how much she's going to be attracted to me once I get ""bigger."" She makes it a point to bring it up constantly. ""Get bigger for me, bulk up"" and ""you know big muscles make my knees weak"" are phrases I constantly hear. She keeps referring to her attraction for me in the future tense. I feel like I'm always being compared to a ridiculous standard.

&amp;#x200B;

What's worse is she's absolutely obsessed with my weight. She keeps asking me if i have lost weight and telling me that she notices I look a little thinner. It's to the point that I don't want to deal with it anymore. I feel like I'm supposed to match this ideal figure she has in her head and I don't know if I can. Most importantly, I don't want to. 

&amp;#x200B;

Besides her demands, she has made comments that have just floored me. Once we noticed this huge dude walking in a mall and she flat out said I should look like that. As if that was not humiliating enough, she once commented that I should ask my bodybuilder buddy for tips on how to get bigger. 

&amp;#x200B;

Despite it all, I respect and love her. But I don't think we're a good fit. She has this vision and she keeps trying to mold me to fit her ideal man. It's disrespectful and I have decided not to put up with it.

&amp;#x200B;

However, I need an outsider's view on all of this. Am I exaggerating? Is this normal behavior? Would you say this to your SO? Would you tolerate these comments from your SO?

&amp;#x200B;

Tl;dr My girlfriend keeps making comments about how I should get ""bigger"" and it is bothering me."
43,"My (35M) wife (33F) has become another person after getting paralyzed!


I'm going to be on a rant and I hardly have the time to type everything out in a post without the kids interuppting me.

My wife was diagnosed almost 2 years ago with a rare spinal infection which left her paralyzed from the waist down and needs help with everything.

We were living a happy life until that morning when she woke up with no mobility. We have 2 young kids. One was just 3 months old and the other was 2 years old when this happened.

I've been by her side taking her to hospitals and therapy and left my business to do whatever I could to help her recover as fast and as best as possible. My business suffered and has put me in debt for almost 6 months to keep it running. I currently am not working and become a home stay dad without any financial assistance and have to pay everything out of pocket with no insurance.

I've never thought of abandoning my family or divorcing her, but now she has started treating me like her personal assistant and abusing me calling me an a\_hole and to f\_off when I do things for myself or for my kids that I want without her permission for example visiting my parents. She really messed my head and I am always angry with everyone and my family and it's become toxic. I don't know what to do anymore and sometimes think of ways to just die in a way where my kids or family won't be traumatized as much.

I talked to my wife, nothing changed. She doesn't care. I talked to my family, they side with her saying she is traumatized from the disability, but what about my trauma that I suffer from on the daily. I never was able to fully go to work, raising two kids by myself and having to deal with the mental abuse and treatment of my wife and her family which is another story altogether. I lost everything.

How do you think I should handle this? Sorry for the rant

\---  

\*\*TL;DR;\*\* : wife lost mobility from spinal infection, made me her personal assistant, verbally and mentally abuses me everyday, even though i am raising the kids to the best of my ability, i am not wanted to raise them my way. what can i do?"
44,"Me [29F] with my husband’s family - my husband [35M] and I are going through a crisis, and his family can’t help but to make it about THEM.


Very long story made very short - my husband suffers from Schizophrenia, and while it is medicated something in his condition recently changed and he had a violent episode involving me, ultimately resulting in him being arrested.

First of all, his mother couldn’t get to the jail fast enough to bail him out. Both his brother and I tried to get her to think about that for a minute (because what has changed in his condition is an unknown at this point) but she wouldn’t hear it. Despite the fact that he nearly killed me, she kept telling my BIL that my husband was just stressed out because I “work too much” and my husband has to take care of the house. My husband does not work outside of the home.

His sister then butts in and is mad that people are acting like her brother is “a criminal” and that we’re “being mean” to my husband’s mom and dad and that they’re just trying to “support their son.” Let me be clear, I’m not mad at my husband and I don’t think he’s a bad person. I don’t want to punish him, but I also don’t think it’s safe for everyone to just sweep this under the rug. He nearly killed me and, thus far, nothing has been done to stabilize his condition.

Now his mom is sending out letters to the family stating they shouldn’t believe the police reports and if they really want to know what happened that night they should talk to her and she’ll tell them. Uh, yeah, the police were there and she wasn’t. She’s suggesting to everyone who will listen that I drove my husband to his break because I’m working full time and not doing my share to keep up the house while my husband keeps up the yard etc.

Seriously, I nearly died and instead of taking the time to fully process that I am putting it on the back burner to try my damndest to get my husband the mental health assistance and diagnosis he needs and my in-laws are whining and complaining that I’m against them because I’ve asked them not to treat my husband like a victim. They (the in-laws) keep wanting to come over and shop my house for his things (despite there being an automatic court order because of the crime committed saying they can’t) and they keep wanting to tell me “what really happened” despite the fact that I was there. They keep telling me that my husband “doesn’t hate me” because I “got him in trouble” and on and on. Not a single person has even asked if I’m okay.

On one hand, I’d like to keep things civil with these people because I do have kids with my husband and I don’t want them to be affected by having a huge chuck of their family cut out, but really what benefit are these people having in my kids’ lives if they keep acting like this?

Do I try to keep the peace of tell them to hit the bricks?

**TLDR**: my [29F] husband [35M] had a mental “episode” due to his Schizophrenia, resulting in a violent assault on me that nearly killed me and landed him in jail. His family thinks we should just go on as normal and that it’s likely my fault this happened anyway (not how his disease works, but thanks, jerks).  They think I’m being mean by wanting to get to the bottom of this. Do I treat them civilly or cut them out completely??"
45,"My Girlfriend has legally changed her name after every break up she’s had?


throwaway because people know my account, and I haven’t told anyone about this yet.

My girlfriend [26f] and I [31m] met at the gym around 18 months ago. I go there to work out 5 mornings a week before work at the around the same time and she worked out then too. It was always pretty early so a lot of the time it was just the two of us in there, which led us to notice each other and give a little ‘haha it’s just us again’ awkward smile. I always thought she was cute and guessed she might like me because it seemed like she could have been deliberately coming to work out when she knew I’d be there. And not to be cocky but I’m a decently attractive guy. One time I was doing the lat pull sort of  wrong and she came up to correct so that I didn’t injure myself, which led us to get talking. After being gym acquaintances for a few weeks I eventually asked her out for drinks. From then, we were inseparable and we’ve been dating ever since. 

Our relationship is really great. All my ex girlfriends would constantly pick fights and be kinda needy but she’s so easy and we have a great time together. We’re active people s so we do a lot of sporty/outdoor activities together, which I love. I honestly thought I’d end up marrying this woman. 

After around a year we moved in together - it made sense because we were spending most nights together anyway, and we could get a nicer place if we paid rent together rather than the separate one bed apartments we were living in. 

Now this is where it gets weird - recently she was flying back to her home country (she’s British) to visit her family for a couple weeks. She called me in a panic because she’d forgotten her passport and was scared she’d miss the flight. She asks me to get it out her bedside draw and drive to the airport to deliver it to her. I find it amongst her stuff and when I pick it up this driving license fall out. It was kinda tucked into it.  It had her picture and details but with a completely different name.

I was obviously really freaked out and suspicious by this but I decided to act normal until she got back from her trip, to give me a chance to investigate before I blew up at her. So I drove to the airport and gave her the passport and a kiss goodbye like nothing had happened. While she was away, I had a thorough look through her stuff (in her bedside draw and some of her suitcases under the bed) and found 7 separate ID cards with 4 different names including the name I know her as. 

So many possibilities were running through my head the whole time she was away. I was terrified that she was not the person I knew and loved. When she got back (couple days ago) I sat her down and tried to confront her in a way that was open and calm as possible, even though I felt like screaming - 

She has had 3 other serious boyfriends that I know everything about. She told me that she legally changed her name after each breakup - to ‘help her get over it and start fresh’. She said that she felt her identity had been tied up in her long term boyfriends so when the relationships ended she felt like she needed everything to be new in order to get over it - including her name. She explained that the reason she moved out of the U.K. was also for this reason. She apologised for hiding this but said it wasn’t nearly and dodgy as it seemed. She got upset with me for not letting it go after she explained so we argued and she’s  been staying at a friends since then while I think this through. 

I don’t know what to do and if I should end things because of this? Even if it is true it’s a huge thing to keep from someone and it’s so over the top. I’m so fucking confused and  don’t want to give up the marriage/kids I could have with her one day... where the fuck do I go from here. 

TL;DR: I found loads of ID cards with different names belonging to my girlfriend. She says that she has legally changed her name following all the relationship break ups she’s had."
46,"My (M, 30) wedding has pushed my relationship with a longtime friend (M, 30) to the brink.


We've been friends for nearly two decades and, from the beginning, there has been one issue we've run into repeatedly: Him wanting an extremely close friendship and me preferring just a moderately close one. 

&amp;#x200B;

I don't want to have long phone conversations with him every day, visit him out-of-state multiple times a year, and share every detail of my life with him as soon as it happens. But he pushes for these things and I feel guilty for hurting his feelings when I don't provide them. For years I sat on the phone with him for hours every day just to avoid telling him I didn't want to talk to him as often and for as long as he wanted to talk to me. When I finally did break down and tell him how I felt about the phone calls, it understandably hurt his feelings a great deal but we ended up getting past it. But the same fundamental issue with our friendship has persisted and just continues to manifest itself in other ways.

&amp;#x200B;

I consider him a good friend and care about him, but he gets miffed if I don't tell other people he's my ""best"" friend and acts jealous about me spending time with other friends. The truth is that my fiancee is my best friend and I'm closer to my brother and another friend than I am to him, but I dare not say this to him because he's so sensitive about any hint that he's not as big a part of my life as I am of his.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm getting married next June and he is now upset and not speaking to me because I chose my brother as my best man and not him. I know the hurt is emotional and not rational: He doesn't have a brother of his own and made me the best man at his own wedding, which I happily did for him. But now I can't help but feel frustrated that he's making an issue about being ""just"" a groomsman and not best man at my own wedding. He's not a person who sublimates his own emotions, so it does no good that he realizes I'm not doing anything wrong by making my brother my best man: He still responds to perceived slights and hurt feelings by visibly and verbally getting an attitude about it.

&amp;#x200B;

I would hate to end the friendship entirely, but I also hate feeling like I have to walk on eggshells around him and hate being made to feel guilty for not putting him before other people in my life that I actually feel closer to than I do him. I know you can't just tell another person to stop feeling hurt, but is there any way to help soothe a friend's hurt feelings in a situation like this without just giving in to what they want? 

&amp;#x200B;

I already dread the fact that even if we get past the best man thing, I will then have to explain to him that my fiancee and I only want the best man (my brother) and maid of honor to make toasts at our reception, because I already know he's going to be mad about not getting to make a toast of his own. He wants some sort of position of prominence at the wedding that puts him ""above"" the other groomsmen and my brother as an important part of my life, but the truth is that I don't want that because to me he is not above them. And that's the crux of the problem.

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR: My friend is angry about me making my brother my best man instead of him. I want to be sympathetic about his feelings because I know they come from a place of hurt about our friendship being unbalanced and not a genuine belief on his part that I don't have the right to choose my brother over him. But even if we get over this specific hurdle, what is the prognosis for the friendship as a whole? Is it inevitable for an unbalanced friendship to eventually collapse? And if not, how do we get past this issue once and for all?"
47,"I am (35 M) contemplating divorce due to my wife (42 F) being financially unrealistic and blaming me for being 'broke'


Been with wife for 6 years, married 3, we have 2 small children and seemingly live a great life. I am 35, she is 42. We bought a house in Los Angeles and earn about $150k combined.  She makes 100k, I make 50k, She pays  60% of mortgage, electricity, and her car. I pay 40% of mortgage, gas, water, all groceries, trash, family health insurance, my car is paid for. 

*I say we live a seemingly great life because in my mind, we do. We have two amazing kids, a beautiful home, nice cars, and I know people would die for what we have.  The problems comes from what seems like a mental issue with my wife when it comes to spending money.  She always goes well above 'normal' and buys way more than needed.   Whether it's big or small, she always spends more than we need. 

*Some examples of her extra spending.....when we bought house furniture, I agreed to items which would be around $3000, she bought more and spent $8000. Our appliances, we had old functional appliances, I was ok with using them until the next sale, she wanted brand new appliances before moving in, spent about $7,000. Our kids bday parties, I tell her lets have them at home, we have a great backyard and this is why we have a house. She wants to have them at fancy venues with catering etc, we have had 3 parties, they were $2,000 each, for a 1st, 1st and 2nd bday.  Weekend trips/theme parks.... We go on weekend trips to local areas (San Diego, San Francisco, Vegas) maybe 6-7 times a year, most of the time it's a spur of the moment decision from her, like on Wednesday she will say let's goto San Diego on Friday. Dinners.... She wants to eat out 3-5x a week, eating out like sushi, or something that's $40-80. She hates fast food, no lie, one time I brought in n out home for dinner and she tells me 'in n out??? Did you buy this because you don't have money?'

*My point of view is like this.... We have all of our bills paid, we pay on time, we have food on our table, we have an emergency fund, let's be happy. We are doing just fine. My extra money goes into paying my CC debt, so technically close to payday I can get to zero in my account, but I know it's not because it's zero, it's because I'm paying extra to debt. I don't feel broke. 

*Her point of view is, she's struggling with debt and is upset I'm not 'stepping up' and 'such a loser' for not helping her more with this extra stuff.  She puts me down and talks as if we are dirt poor and worthless and not helping her. 

Our latest issue is because our son's 1st birthday party cost $2,000 to throw. And she's super upset I don't have half the cash to give her. She charged it to her card, and can't believe I don't have $500 cash to give to her immediately. Which I don't. BUT, I don't have the cash because in the last 3 weeks, I spent $800 cash on things like, her own bday dinner, her own gift, sports event for our entire family, and a random weekend trip to Santa Barbara. Again I don't use credit cards and she uses them all the time. Because I didn't have $500 on hand, she went into a rage about me being worthless, me not being a provider, and I'm just sick of it. We are doing just fine but it's these extras she's doing that we can't keep up with.   I truly think she has a sickness or severe insecurity with money.  I don't believe she can just be content, even if I earned more money I'm sure she would just spend more. 

*Some more background about her, she came from a poor upbringing, then became successful on her own.  She has this thing about keeping up with the Joneses that she will never admit to and has this really strange thing with gifts. She literally broke down in tears one christmas when she didn't get what she wanted (I spent $300 on 3 pairs of shoes, but she wanted one $400 pair) and the tears were strong, tears like someone died. I ended up returning the shoes and bought her the $400 pair. Ever since then I've always made an effort to buy her something nice even though it's tough for me to afford it.   There was also an incident when I bought the family tickets to see a dodgers game which fell one day before her bday. The game cost me around $300 and considering it was the first Dodger game for her mother and one of our children, I thought this was a nice Bday gift. Nope. She was upset that I didn't have a bday dinner and gift planned the next day. I had to scramble to make those both happen. 

*I'm so sick of this. She lives in a fantasy land and thinks she rich but clearly tries to live a life she can't afford. And it's pushing me away. I've tried to stay civil for our children, but now I'm thinking the children may be better off without her pushing her ideas into them. Maybe if I meet someone else, they will have a better example of reality.  Also forgot to add, she's extremely emotional and does completely irrational things when mad. Like after this fight she told our realtor we want to sell the house. The house is now listed for sale. 

Tl;Dr wifes spending is out of Control, wants to eat sushi everynight and blames me for not giving her that lifestyle even though we do more than well enough for a regular lifestyle."
48,"Fiancé (F25) says she doesn’t see a future with me (M26) anymore but she still loves me. What can I do?


Me and my fiancé have been together for about 3 years and got engaged last November. So last night out of the blue she tells me that she doesn’t want to “be us” anymore. She says that she doesn’t see a future with me and that the mortgage, the engagement, everything, gives her anxiety and this started around April. This is despite the fact she drove the decisions to get a house and get engaged. I never wanted to get married before I met her but with her it just felt right. 

She says I haven’t done anything wrong and she can’t explain why she feels the way she does. She assured me there is no one else. 

I still really love her and I feel like the honeymoon phase has worn off for her and now she feels intense commitment fear. She says she still loves me but initially said she didn’t want to try and make it work. She now says that she might try couples counselling or a trial separation.

TL;DR Is this relationship doomed? I don’t know what to do. I can’t imagine my life without her. Should I push for counselling? Any advice would be great."
49,"My boyfriend (25) went on vacation with his ex (26f) without telling me (21f)


I'm in shock. He hasn't told me anything about it. I found out through the ex's instagram story (boyfriend doesn't know I follow her on a fake account). I am on vacation with my family right now. Didn't even know he is out of the country.

Also, my boyfriend still hasn't told his ex about me. She doesn't know I exist. They were together for 5 years before we started dating.

I feel fucking betrayed and don't know what to do.
Am I being cheated on?
Is there any way I can stay with him?
I don't want to leave but I'm afraid I have to.

50,"Brothers girlfriend (21F) is really sick and currently in hospital. He (21M) can't make it to my (27M) wedding next week and my fiancee (26F) thinks the wedding is ruined.


My brother's girlfriend of a year and a half is really sick at the moment. She was in bed one night and started to have a lot of trouble breathing. It got really bad to the point they needed to call an ambulance. There's something wrong with her left lung that somehow caused it to partially collapse. They needed to go in and do something. I don't understand much about this, but she's on oxygen/lung support. She needs to have another operation on Monday to do something else to her lung. I wish I could remember what the name of it is. I just know it's bad. She is in bad shape. They said even after the operation on Monday she's not getting out for a while. It came as a suprise because she's a very health conscious women and you'd never think there was anything wrong with her. She's studying to be a personal trainer. She looked perfectly healthy, but it just goes to show that anyone could get really sick at any moment. 

My mom told me that my brother has been visiting his girlfriend every day at the hospital. He spends a couple of hours there so she doesn't get lonely or bored. I've spoken to him and he's pretty worried. He told me that he may not be able to make the wedding due to this. He and his girlfriend originally planned to fly to New Zealand from Australia for the wedding. He just said he doesn't know if he can leave when she's in this bad of shape. She doesn't have any family. She was a foster kid until she was 18. I said I understand and it's looking like he won't be able to make it because yesterday she got worse. He's 99% percent missing the wedding next week. 

The wedding is next week and my fiancee is not really understanding the situation. She thinks that the wedding is not as special if not every member of the family is there. She thinks that it's really important for the day to go off for her perfectly. She said that I needed to find a new best man and it messed up how many groomsmen there were. It caused a big fight and I think the stress is getting to her. She wanted everyone to be there but it's just not possible. 

TL;DR: Brother's girlfriend is really sick. Wife thinks it ruins the wedding day if he doesn't come to the wedding next week."
51,"Is an 8 year age gap between a [18F] and a [26M] too much?


I just finished my first year of college and I made friends with a grad student. He’s really sweet and we have a lot of things in common, but he’s also eight years older than I am. He had been pursuing me for about a month before I gave in and said yes, but it all seemed so weird given that he graduated college when I started high school, and all of my friends and I felt strange about it. He gave me the standard talk about how I come off as older than I really am and mature, and that he’s never met someone he’s had more in common with than me, but I didnt think that really helped. This changed when we were hanging out one night and he kept pulling me closer to him, until eventually he kissed me and we hooked up. We were just gonna call it a one night stand but we hang out a lot, so he suggested we date and end it in two months, which I agreed to. We’re not nearly at that point, but he wants to abolish our agreed end date given that we have a mutual friend in a relationship with a larger age gap. I’m hesitant to do anything given that he’s a really nice guy and I’m afraid he’s more into me than I am into him. I don’t want to lose his friendship given that we are pretty close and I find it very easy to talk to him, but I fear we may have gone too far. I also admit I am pretty immature compared to him and I enjoy partying and just plain out messing around, which I think he may of aged out of, and I don’t want my own flighty nature to disappoint him. I am legally an adult now so this isn’t illegal, but we both agreed it is kind of morally gray given the difference in life experience. I just could use some advice or opinions on the subject, like what would you do if you had a friend in either his or my situation? Or have you been in either his or my situation? Pls help.

Tl;dr: I’m a college freshman dating a grad student for the summer, is it weird?"
52,"At the last minute, boyfriend wants me to contribute to his down payment for house?


Hi reddit - not sure if I should post to here or personal finance, since it's a combination of both! I'll break the issues down for clarity. I (42F) have been with my boyfriend (39M) for almost two years. We have been talking about moving in for awhile, and he wants to get engaged. We have not lived together before - he has two cats, I have a 10-year old kid, but we are quite similar in our living styles and my kid likes spending time with him. 

Relationship piece: 

We've been talking about living together for about a year now. He wanted to buy, makes more sense to buy than rent given the HCOL in Denver. I have been very clear about my lease expiring in September 2019, and that we need to get a jump on this. I am very big on security, providing a stable home for my son, and having time to plan and hopefully minimize the stress of moving. SO - my lease expires on two months. Nothing as been done, despite weekly conversations about moving in together, what needs to be done. etc. I have sent him places, discussed areas to move, we decided that he would purchase the house on his own but we would split expenses 50/50. Verbally, he was all about making it happen. Action-wise, nothing. He has taken vacations for weeks at a time, knowing that this needed to be handled, and nothing. He let financing lapse, he didn't do anything with home listings that I sent him, nothing. Now he asking that I speak to my landlord about going month-to-month, or just staying a few extra months. I refused. We've had plenty of time, and I refuse to accommodate his acknowledged lack of priority of this topic. If we do not have a resolution on this within the next few weeks, I'm re-signing my lease. The relationship questions that I have: is this delaying a huge red flag, all talk to action? I'm looking for a partner, and I'm concerned that if I have to direct, and then give up on, something this big and impactful on our relationship, will I always be doing things like this on my own? He has blamed everything from selfishness to ADD to work to ""it just hasn't been a priority"", but swears that now it really is and he needs to show it better...but just doesn't. I spent 15 years married to a man who I basically had to parent, I'm concerned that I'll wind up doing it again. He states that he is in love, wants to grow old with me, but his actions don't show it. Now he is scrambling for financing, which leads me to....

The money piece: 

We are down to the wire regarding my lease, after months of delays. The general conversations that we have had over the last year involved a good amount of financial disclosures, and it was decided that since I am not in a position to buy right now (due to student loans currently in deferment while I complete my graduate degree), he would do so. Also, we are not married, and I am adamant that I do not want to purchase a home with someone to whom I am not married. Our agreement was, and has been for months, that he would purchase and I would pay half of the expenses. His parents were also going to give him the 20% down payment, and he makes almost twice what I do so was able to qualify for a decent mortgage amount. Yesterday, he informed me that he doesn't want to get the full 20% from his parents, and he doesn't want to completely empty his own accounts (he wants to have at last 25k left over), so what can I contribute to the down payment? NOTHING. I refuse to contribute what I basically consider a non-refundable security deposit (he wants 15k, which would completely wipe me out) for a property that I do not own, am not eligible for the interest or property tax deductions, or the potential equity since I will not be on the loan or the title. He can either buy a home or we can rent. Am I a jerk that I see it like this, and that I'm really upset that we've had this plan for a year now and he is suddenly throwing this in the mix and it's my problem? He has struggled to commit  to me in the past, is this just one more roadblock that he is throwing up in order to avoid being the bad guy in the whole situation? This whole thing has had me so stressed and feeling awful - do I appear to be some kind of money-grubber if I continue to refuse to contribute what is essentially, to me, a large security deposit that I will most likely not get back? I will not do this, and renting would fix the issue if distance between us but I don't even know if I want to rent with him after all this. I'm exhausted, stressed, and tired. 

Reddit - should i contribute to the down payment, at considerable strain to my finances and security? Do I consider renting with a partner who is flaky, and can't stick with his plans, despite having other awesome qualities? 

Please - either tell me how I'm wrong or slap some sense about this guy into my head! 

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR: Financial change of plans and lack of follow-through regarding housing situation, should I give in or is this a huge red flag?"
53,"I (27F) may have an unhealthy relationship with sex . Should I tell SO (28M)?


I (27F) am in a new relationship with a an amazing guy (28M) and I have never been this at peace. I haven't had many relationship experiences, but my ex boyfriend was my first love and first sexual partner. Our relationship was really bad; think almost daily fights, crying, yelling... I was extremely anxious and depressed while with him and we stayed together for a long time like that.   


At one point, the only good thing about the relationship was the sex, and we were having a lot of it. We didn't really do much, aside from hanging out at home, fight, make up and have sex. I was having severe insecurity issues with my ex boyfriend; I wanted him to like me but we were fighting so much, and I might have linked my self worth to sex while I was with him, and many times I felt like he was with me because of it (which I knew was not true, we were both in love with each other, but somehow my brain wanted to think that).   


Fast forward 3 years later, I'm finally dating someone new, and he's amazing. We hung out as friends first, and he was making efforts to plan outings for us, and make me experience new things with him. I was hesitant because even though I started to like him romantically, I think I had some fears linked to my previous relationship, and the idea of having a boyfriend did not sound appealing at all. But he asked me out, and I decided to give it a try. We started having sex, and I think some of the unhealthy thinking is resurfacing.   


He was just yesterday telling me how much he liked me and how he wants to spend time and do many things with me this summer; yet today I'm feeling irrationally insecure and worrying that sex is somehow going to change our relationship (which I really really enjoyed when we were hanging out as just friends).   


He is very considerate and takes everything I say seriously. So I'm not sure if this is something I should figure out on my own or should mention to him? I am worried that if I tell him this, he might start being careful or stress too much about how much sex we're having vs. how much activities we're doing...  


TL;DR: I might have linked some of my self worth to sex due to a previous unhealthy relationship. New boyfriend is amazing, and I have enjoyed spending time with him. But now that we started having sex, I'm starting to feel some insecurities. Any advice on what I should do? He takes everything I tell him seriously, so is it worth telling him and making him self conscious about how much sex we're having vs. other activities? Or should I figure this out on my own?  


Thank you!"
54,"I [27F] told boyfriend [28M] of 2 years to “fix” his forgetfulness and he’s unapologetic saying he’s just a forgetful person, am I in the wrong?


My boyfriend has admitted himself that he is a very forgetful person, but his opinion is that “he won’t apologize for being forgetful”. 

Examples are losing the house keys after less than half a year and only trying to look for them twice in 2 months (told me to just buy a new set and didn’t want to look again), forgetting weekend plans I’ve mentioned that same week, my cancer scare doctors appointments, and winning lottery tickets to a broadway show I really wanted to see but forgetting to check until it was too late to get the tickets. 

Most recent example was yesterday, there was a raffle for prizes and he couldn’t be at the drawing so I went instead and he forgot to give me the raffle ticket stubs (he picked them up originally, I wasn’t even aware stubs were needed). It’s just like it didn’t cross his mind at all that hey, since she’s leaving to the drawing I should give her the ticket stubs (we live together). He sent a picture with the stub numbers but I was still annoyed because when we won something I was embarrassed only showing the picture and it was lucky they accepted it and didn’t need the physical stub. 

I got annoyed at him for it, and he kept saying “it was okay because he sent the picture” and he got mad at me for being embarrassed and annoyed about it saying “Were they laughing AT you? Who’s going to remember or care?”and refused to apologize and said this was the hill he would die on in the relationship. 

I told him to fix his forgetfulness and he took offence to it saying it’s just the way he is, and it’s stupid to tell anyone to “fix” their forgetfulness. But I feel that if anyone cared enough about something they wouldn’t forget about it. We’ve tried putting things in his calendar for important dates which works, but you can’t put life reminders in the calendar for things like losing keys or remembering to give raffle tickets. 

So am I in the wrong for telling him to fix it? Or is this something that I need to accept for life that it won’t change?

TLDR: Told boyfriend to fix his forgetfulness, he’s saying it’s just the way he is and won’t apologize for being that way"
55,"My [29F] husband’s [31M] beard is too long.


Hello, Reddit. 

My husband and I have been married for almost 11 years. I love him to pieces. He’s my best friend, my whole world. I seriously can’t imagine life without him. (You’ve all heard this before, right? Right before the big BUT?)

Yeah. BUT.

One day, he decided to get lazy with the shaving. Then he decided he liked how he looked with a beard (so do I!) so he kept letting it grow. And grow. And grow. It got full and bushy and a little wild. He trimmed it up, made it nice, but he kept some on his chin long because he liked how it looked.

After a few months of letting it grow like that, he bought some beard shampoo and conditioner. He keeps his head shaved, so this was something of a big deal. He laughed about it, I laughed about it, it was okay.

A few months go by. He started talking about putting some beads in it. I didn’t really mind the idea, but I thought he was joking (he does that).

He got some beads. Then he taught himself how to braid and started braiding it. A big braid at first, and then the braids multiplied. Every month or so, he would talk about maybe cutting it off, maybe it was getting to be too long.

He’s been saying this for 4 years.

Now the problem here isn’t that he doesn’t take care of it. He keeps it clean and neat. He gets comments on it almost every single time we go out. He is very proud of his beard. 

But I’m slowly losing my mind.

It’s *long*. It’s over a foot long *while braided *. He has to tuck it into his shirt when he eats. So you can only imagine what happens when we have sex. (I know, I know, we’ve tried other positions and we’ve also tried with him using a hair tie to keep the braids up. It makes him look even more ridiculous.)

I love this man to death. I don’t want to rain on his big beard parade. But I feel like I’m losing some of my attraction to him. The beard is so distracting.

How can I bring this up? I’m afraid of turning this into a “your beard or me” situation.

TL;DR: My husband’s beard is over a foot long. He loves it. I don’t. How can I bring this up without ruining him?"
56,"I just found out my [27F] boyfriend [30M] of 2.5 years was previously married for 6 years


I’m not really sure if I need advice. I really just need to rant, and confirm that my feelings aren’t completely crazy. Bare with me!

When I met my boyfriend, I had recently gotten out of a relationship, and through sharing our past experiences, he told me that his last serious relationship was about 3 years ago. I knew little about the relationship; I knew her name, he said they dated for about a year, and it was pretty bad and never really that serious. Normal enough for me. So we proceeded on with our relationship.

There was a time we were sitting on my bed, drinking, talking, just enjoying each other.. and he accidentally calls me her name. I wasn’t immediately taken aback.. I mean, it was bothersome, but people make mistakes, right? Although, in my head I’m thinking “after 3 years, he still thinks of her name?” We move on from it, but I, of course, never forgot it.

I should add here, that we were in a long distance relationship in the beginning. He’s in the military stationed in North Carolina, and I was living in Pennsylvania. So, about 6 months into the relationship, I uproot my life (happily, don’t get me wrong) and moved into his home in North Carolina. We were so crazily in love. I still am. He’s always treated me so well. His love for me, I’ve learned over time, has no bounds, and it radiates off of him. But after moving in, I start seeing old pictures online with his ex, and start putting some pieces together with dates. I realize that he, in fact, had been with this woman only 2 months before we had met. Not three years. Obvious confrontation. He plays it off like he just didn’t really care enough about her or that relationship to even bother me with the fact that it was recent. Shitty response, but we ultimately move on.

So, after a few whirlwind months of amazing love with this man, I become pregnant with our now 9 month old son. I notice one day that he received a piece a mail that had his name on it, alongside his ex’s name, with HIS last name as hers. I confront him, of course, and he brushes it off like he didn’t know why that happened and it was some sort of mistake. Okay, maybe. Y’all, I’m too understanding sometimes! So, it happens a few more times before I finally confront him again. I guess my gut started to get that feeling that something was off. I straight up ask him, “were you married to her?” Totally not ready to hear if he had been, but he, of course, shakes that off as a ridiculous thought. Okay, I trust this man. With my life, honestly.

Today, he receives yet another piece of mail with both of their names on it. The mail is always from the bank he has his mortgage with, so my gut started to feel funny again, and I’m starting to really feel the urge to get to the bottom of this. Assuming both of their names are on it is because maybe he put her name on the house when he bought it? And maybe they mistakenly put his last name on hers during the mailing process? That had to be what it was. And obviously, even the thought of that had me starting to reel up a little bit. I mean, that would be a pretty big thing to lie about, but nothing we can’t get to the bottom of. To confirm my suspicions, I look up his name in our county’s register of deeds.. and there it all was. The power of attorney papers he signed over to her, the separation agreements. Everything, finally pieced together, and my heart completely shattered. The dates of the separation agreement are after we had begun dating, and the divorce papers weren’t signed until a year after that.. while I was pregnant with our child.

After confronting him about it, he doesn’t feel much regret. He told me they were married for six years. That it was so absolutely terrible that he never wanted to think about or relive it again. So for his selfish reasons, he lied to me, even after I gave him chances to tell the truth. And when asked what was so terrible about it that he had to hide such a huge life thing.. he could only come up with average relationship things that break a lot of people up. He’s upset and sorry that I’m hurting, but he’s not sorry he did it. His words.

As if this isn’t enough of an on-the-fence deal breaker for me, the fact that he seems not to have much, if any, empathy towards anything about this just pushes me over more towards the breaker side. I don’t think he realizes that he stole a lot of decisions from me that I could’ve possibly made differently based off of his past situation. Maybe I wouldn’t have. But I should’ve had the opportunity to make that decision for myself. But because he selfishly wanted to just “not talk about it,” I have to find out this way and feel so stuck that I’ve built a family with this man based off of lies.

My plan right now is to just give him space to try and soak in everything, and see if he comes around with a little more empathy, and realizes that this would be something that would need a lot of fixing in our relationship. It feels like a huge betrayal, and if his plan is to blow it off.. I know what I have to do. And while he’s doing that, I’m taking my space to think and figure out, logically, if it’s even what *i* want anymore. Because I’m not sure I’d be able to get past it, and if it’s worth the mental and emotional anguish to even try.

If you’ve taken the time to read through this, I bless your heart. He has made statements that basically only I would feel betrayed, and that I’m probably in the minority of people in this world that would let this bother them this much. He say’s it wouldn’t bother him, roles reversed, but I can’t picture that being true. If I am the minority, please tell me.. but I know I have to have some justifications in this crazy situation!

TL;DR Boyfriend of 2.5 years never told me he was married for six years; got caught lying about many facts about that relationship, and enough red flags sent me to look up public records and I found his separation agreement, dated during the time we had already started dating, and divorce papers a year later while I was pregnant with our son"
57,"I'm lonely, but I say no to social opportunities. I hate this about myself.


Every once in awhile, I (24F) will receive an invitation to hang out with someone. At this point in my life, I'll usually decline. For instance, my roommate (25F) invited me to hang out with a few people at our house tonight. I declined, lying about being at a friend's house when in actuality I went to a bar to drink and read when I first heard they were coming over. They're fine people, if intimidatingly cool. I could've managed, though. I just couldn't process the idea of spending time with other people.

I did everything I thought I was supposed to do as a young professional. I joined a community group at my church. I started volunteering. But I still come home from work and sit in my room. Alone. Looking at my phone and seeing people from work, community group, and volunteering being more socially successful than me, hanging out with each other while I go uninvited. If I was invited, I'd likely decline.

Sometimes I've driven to community group, arrived in the parking lot, and then turned around and gone to a movie alone instead. That's happened consistently the last few weeks.

I can't put my finger on how I became this person. I know I struggle with vulnerability; I'm rarely the person who asks others to hang out. I'm terrified I'll be deemed ""boring"" or something. But when I see a happy couple, or someone I follow online hanging out with their friends at a bar, or whatever, I get struck with pain. It makes me shut down.

I've considered starting over. I know I'm an interesting person; I make others feel heard because I'm a great listener. Maybe moving somewhere else, or trying out for a play at a local community theater would make me better. Meet new people. Be someone new. Someone who shows that they need people. Someone hospitable.

I would love to hear from others who have struggled with this. How do I break out of it? What are some practical brain steps I can take to be more vulnerable?

tl;dr: I want to hang out with people, but can't seem to get past mental blocks that make me refuse. What can I do to be more vulnerable about my need for other people?"
58,"My (33M) GF (35F) is unhappy with her appearance. What can I do to help her feel more positive?


Over the past 5 months my girlfriend has had to spend 4 nights away from home for work purposes. Because she spent most of her time in hotels that meant she had to eat out each night due to no cooking facilities available. This meant she has put on some weight - going up 2 dress sizes - and it upsets her. She's also frustrated because most of her clothes don't fit her at present.

This week she has started a new job where she will be home each night and plans to go to the gym most nights after work. Our diet at home is healthy so that combined with the increase in exercise should help her lose the weight.

But what can I do to make her feel better about herself for the time being? She has used the terms ""fat"" and ""disgusting"" and ""horrible"" to describe herself where as I always counter and make frequent references to her being ""sexy"" and ""gorgeous"" in my eyes while continuing to be very affectionate towards her. But I'm wondering if there's anything further I can say or do in addition to help her feel more positive.

tldr GF is drop dead gorgeous but feels the complete opposite; how do I get her to see the truth?"
59,"My [23F] work schedule no longer aligns with [25M] coworker. I would like to now ask him for a friendly meetup, but I may have a sign that I shouldn't.


So, my coworker and I work in the corporate side of a warehouse company in a cube farm. I've been there for a couple of months, and I've shadowed him and learned a lot during this time in my intro period before they take me on as a perm. employee. It was apparent from the 2nd day that I liked this guy so I soon took all precaution to keep focused.  I knew it was going to be a bad crush so I tried to course correct early and make myself scarce. It has not worked. The opposite actually. It also didn't help that I had a third party guy playfully trying to play matchmaker with us. (It's a very relaxed environment, and it didn't offend me, nor did I feel harassed, etc.) It put things into my head and I'm a little embarrassed that I let it run away with me because I'm the type to think it could all be a joke at my expense. Since he is a good guy to everyone, I probably just have been misreading things a little?

So, few weeks passed and he opened up about some anxieties that completely threw me off guard. And later on when he was having a really bad day I felt a little fearful about being around a bad work situation he was in, but he later came back around to make sure to tell me he was stressed and really worried he did something to get written up. He looked a mess. I'm probably reading into it, but I was a little flattered he felt it was okay to tell me that and honestly, don't remember a guy being okay with just telling me those things. I immediately wanted to put out all of the fires (as if I had some kind of authority lmao), anything to help him. He's always cool under any pressure, and people say that ""nothing bothers him"", but I got irritated that they more than likely dump a lot of stuff on him and don't realize he can be just as stressed. So, I then I knew I had really become attached and either needed to step back more or try to pursue it. I chose to step back, well... because coworker. I did step up to take on more work to help around if I could, though.


He'd linger, find ways to stop to talk, find me in another row to make sure I was good and at one point made some playful comments that I froze up on and didn't take bait. A running joke. We have very specific interests that align, and physical chemistry. Before he'd leave he'd come back to find me and bring up an interest of mine to have a quick exchange. By this point I'm getting frustrated and casually mention to find me on social media since he mentions his from time to time. That was out of character for me because I don't share mine at all. Anyway, he sort of deflected from it with an excuse that he was lame or something, and nothing came of it. So, okay maybe that made him uncomfortable or something. I told myself I won't try that tack anymore. I backed off for a few weeks. Everything continued as before. 


Now, our schedules changed and we don't work together so I'm pretty bummed. After waiting to see if it would change back, I realize it won't on any consistent basis. But because of the previous nervous social media rejection from him, I'm not sure if I should just approach him in person again or text him outside of the groupme work chat to ask him for lunch or something, if at all.


**TLDR: Ignored a crush on coworker until our schedules separated us. Now want to ask him on a lunch/coffee date. Got declined about connecting via social media and now wondering if I should even try to ask directly for lunch date in person or via text.**"
60,"Me [61F] with my daughter[26F] 26 years, she found out I have Alzheimer’s and wants to tell our family. how do I stop this smoothly?


I am sixty one years. I could tell something insidious was brewing in my body. I lost my way around my favorite park and didn’t remember preheating the oven, things like that. It got to where I looked at my grandmothers antique analog clock and stared at it for many minutes thinking “Whats happened to me why can’t I understand the numbers”.


I avoided the doctor for so long but eventually I did and went through the worst process of getting my diagnosis. My heart fell. I could not accept it myself and I couldn’t put that pain on the rest of my family.


June 28 2019; I do not remembr my sons birthday. My daughter aged 26 corners me alone and says she knows I am not well. I broke and told her my disease.


She made a promise to keep this a secret forever but she wasn’t want to. She was hysterical and had genuine crying tears. She is my youngest and lived with me until 22, she’s very emotional and we have a strong bond. But she is making frustrating mistakes I am not happy with.


On July 2 I receive a mesage from my son in law and he states loosely “I am so sorry you are going through this time and me and (my daughters name) are always here for you emotionally and financially if need be”


I was very upset because I told my daughter not to tell ANYONE which by the name means every person must not know. I called her and unfortunately yelled. I have a very bright mind you know? I worked until a couple years ago. and I have respect that I stand to lose. I am not an old woman. I have technology and use it well. I don’t want to lose myself more when I “”accept”””it.


She is a very sensitive girl and started to cry saying “what will our family do when you suddenly pass without warning and time for us to accept it, I can’t accept it, how do you expect me to deal with this alone when I’m so unglued”


I forgave her because her husband is a part of her unit now and I can see it. But now she keeps visiting me and begging me to tell my two other childs at least. She thinks I need all the support I can get but this is a private matter you see! I have free will I am not a plate of veggies with grey hair damn it!


She says that eventually when I am too far gone she will be forced to tell them and that makes me shake.


How do I force her to see that I am choosing not to tell anyone at least not yet. NoONE else has noticed it. I take medicine and vitamins and I can keep going. I donot want pity I want to spend my last times with my family (husband is already gone) in genuine love.


I am afraid she will go rogue as the stubborn lady she is and tell our family if she hasn’t already. How do I stop this. I still love her. Thank you.



TL;DR: I have Alzheimer’s, daughter finds out and wants to tell family immediately. How do I make her see my points?"
61,"My bf (22M) constantly wants sex and I don’t. I feel like my body isn’t mine


My boyfriend of three years has always been a very sexual person and I used to love sex but after having a baby &amp; being on the pill for months I just want to be left alone.

He wants sex day and night &amp; I force myself to have it with him because if I say no he pouts &amp; makes me feel bad. He says he wants to show me blowjob videos so I can “learn” &amp; that they’ve sucked for the past two years, suddenly out of nowhere. I got upset because my life shouldn’t revolve around pleasing some man’s insatiable sexual needs! Obviously I want to please him but the constant pressure is just terrible.

I feel like my body isn’t even mine. To be clear he never forces me I just feel saying no isn’t an option because of how he reacts. I dread the morning because he wants it when I’ve just woken. He also has a cuckhold fetish &amp; pouts about the fact that he wants me to sleep with other guys and I refuse.

God, I really need some advice how to deal.

62,"UPDATE: I [23F] am planning to move out from living with my boyfriend [24M] without telling him


Link to the [original](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/bcq5qn/i_23f_am_planning_to_move_out_from_living_with_my/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x). Spoiler alert: this isn't a happy ending.

&amp;#x200B;

I'd like to thank everyone who offered advice on the first post - it was really helpful and it helped me to see how things had to change.

&amp;#x200B;

The good news is that a few days after I made that post my bf and I had a fight that made him realise that things weren't working. He was calm and understanding and accepted that I wanted to move out. We decided that we would remain in a relationship even when I'd moved out to see if it was salvageable at all. It was encouraging to see him accept it.

&amp;#x200B;

Now for a lot of bad news. I lost my job (waitressing part time as I'm a student). Because it was the end of the academic year (April) I only had one student loan payment to receive, which meant that I needed a job really badly if I wanted to move out. I couldn't find anything (and was turned down for several jobs) at first. I sat my exams at the end of April and then began looking for a full time job. Anything - I just wanted to leave.

&amp;#x200B;

I got a job at the beginning of May, but they didn't pay me and I had to leave. I was offered another job on the 14th, which I'm still at. Unfortunately, I was offered 40 hours a week but they're only giving me 12 hours a week and because I don't have a contract there's nothing I can do about it. I looked for another full time job and found nothing. I now have a second job where I work between 12-18 hours a week and I'm slowly saving up for a flat deposit. 

&amp;#x200B;

Or at least I was, until the girl I was looking for a flat with told me that she couldn't wait for me to get a deposit together anymore. This was four weeks ago and I can't find anyone else. I won't be able to even apply for rooms in flats until I have a deposit and first month's rent, which isn't easy as I'm still paying bills and rent here. 

&amp;#x200B;

I feel so hopeless. I feel so horrible all the time. I never want to be at home, I'd rather be anywhere else.

&amp;#x200B;

The relationship, of course, did not improve - when I told him how upset I was about the hours at work he told me to suck it up or do something about it. He has no empathy at all. He keeps doing small things that make me want to curl up in a ball and give up. Like the other week we were going for a walk to a park and I thought we were going the wrong way. He huffed and puffed and went ""FINE, We'll go YOUR way!"" then he pushed me hard enough to make me stumbled for a bit. I know it's not abuse and things could be worse, but he does little things like that all the time and when I tell him that it hurt or I didn't like it he scoffs and either tells me that it didn't hurt or he acts like I'm just trying to cause drama.

&amp;#x200B;

I honestly don't know what to do. I'm here until mid-September at the very earliest, and even then that's only if I can find a place to live. 

&amp;#x200B;

I don't know if you can give me advice, obviously it's not something that can be fixed with talking or something. But thank you for reading this. I feel better telling people.

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR - didn't move out, lost my job instead, now can't move out due to lack of money and a place to go and I feel stuck."
63,"My (28f) boyfriend (36M) of 8 years refuses to go to the doctor/make lifestyle changes although something is obviously wrong


There’s A LOT wrong with our relationship and I feel like if he took his mental and physical health seriously not only would our relationship improve and we could move forward but he would be better just for himself and his future. Due to a mental health issue that came to light a few years ago and almost ruined our lives because he wouldn’t acknowledge the problem, he’s on disability and does not work. I work full time, working my way through the corporate world because I want better and know I can achieve it despite obstacles. I’ve worked so hard to get us to stable place (homeless with nothing to almost everything now). A real life glo up. 

Anyways, every single morning he wakes up with stomach pains. While I’m at work, he will not eat anything until I get home around dinner time and we decide what to eat. He might nibble on a piece of bread, a yogurt, and some juice. That’s all his stomach will allow. Usually he ends up stuffing himself at night. Often he’ll drink several beers or whatever alcohol we have on an empty stomach during the day. He never eats any fruits (unless there’s an occasional Naked smoothie) and he doesn’t eat any vegetables besides the romaine salad that he drowns in dressing. Lately he’s been having chest pains/heartburn. He gets concerned about it because it’s painful, but as soon as it goes away he forgets that’s it’s something that needs to be checked out. He’s ALWAYS tired for someone who has zero responsibilities during the day except for maybe grocery shopping or small errands like that. Sometimes he’ll sleep through the night which is  usually after we or just him has been drinking. But if he drank too much that means he’ll be up in the middle of the throwing up. Happens a few times a week. Then if he doesn’t drink he tosses, turns, huff and puffs, and gets angry and irritated that he can’t fall asleep while I’m trying to sleep because I have work in the morning. He doesn’t exercise at all. I try to get him to walk around the block with me and he looks at me like I’m crazy. And because we don’t live within 10mins of “nicer”walking trail, exercise is out of the question. That’s his excuse. 

He is much bigger than when we first met and that was mostly due to the medication he was taking for his mental health. He’s stopped taking said medication back in November of last year. Fine, I didn’t argue, and his doctor gave him the ok. Now since he has trouble sleeping almost every night, he has started taking a natural sleeping aid which he’s pairing with a sleeping pill he found at the pharmacy. And the icing on the cake, when those don’t work he pulls out his old medication and takes those which will completely knock him out for hours. Those pills are known for “bringing you down” and making you tired, but they fuck with the chemicals in your brain. You can’t just take one whenever you fell like it or skip days. Either you’re on it or not. I keep telling him he needs to make lifestyle changes and go to the damn doctor. He keeps saying no and he doesn’t go to the doctor (except the few time while on meds for mental health). And it bugs me because he’s so in an uproar about the US not wanting to give everyone free healthcare, but he has free fucking healthcare due being on a state funded program and refuses to use it.  

Obviously there’s  a lot going on here that ties in with his string of mental health concerns. I just don’t know what to do. There’s so much pressure because I’m the only person he has in his life. Literally, and it’s been really hard. We’ve argued so much lately about our future and how I’m progressing, making goals and he’s just not and is content with being nothing.There’s an essay worth things left out here, but I hope it’s enough to get some kind of advice and just be able to vent. Thanks for the ready everyone.

TL;DR - Boyfriend of 8 years refuse to go to the doctor to check on his mental and physical health needs. He’s been complaining of multiple health concerns which has put a huge strain on our relationship along with many other things. He’s too content with not moving forward in life/has negative outlook and want me to drop long term commitment/hard deadline talks."
64,"My (22F) boyfriend (23M) is overly condescending/know-it-all


Hey reddit. Basically my problem is this: my bf and I have been dating for 2+ years now, and for the most part he’s a really great guy. He’s charming, smart, funny, caring, and affectionate. But I’m reaching my limit with how condescending he can be with me sometimes. I know he’s a smart, well-read guy, and I don’t think I’m dumb, but my god sometimes he talks to me like I’m a complete idiot. 

For example, tonight, he asked me to put on a certain soccer game on TV while he put away dishes. Ok. I quickly searched all sports (it’s a smart remote/smart TV thing), but the game wasn’t televised. I checked ESPN and told him it wasn’t on. He snaps at me to “just check ESPN like I asked”, and I say I did, and that the game wasn’t on. He then grabs the remote and puts it on the EXACT channel I already had it on and goes “oh”. 

Most of the time, it’s not necessarily what he says to me that’s bothersome, but how he says it. It’s always snarky, snapping at me, or in a mocking sort of tone. I’m pretty laid back so usually I can brush it off, but it’s getting to the point where I’m constantly on the verge of tears. 

Any advice? I know the obvious solution is to talk to him about it, but I don’t know what to say or how to go about it

TL;DR: my boyfriend is great most of the time but has a habit of talking to me like I’m fucking stupid and I’m losing my mind over it"
65,"My (20M) mom (49F) died yesterday and I want to be with my long distance girlfriend (18F), but my dad (49M), brother (18M), and family are grieving too.


I want to apologize as this won’t be a happy post and it will likely be an incoherent wall of text. I have no one to speak with who isn’t grieving as well, so I need outside perspective. 

Two days ago I was in the middle of a vacation seeing my long distance girlfriend in Sweden. I was supposed to be staying with her family for a month and a half, until August 2nd, but on July 15th I received a text that my mom had been hospitalized. Her parents immediately purchased me new tickets for a flight home to the US and I was able to be there for her when she passed away the next day.

My mom was the person everyone went to when it got rough (she was always positive and optimistic) and everyone was really close to her, so all extended and close family is grieving heavily. I have never been very emotionally close with my brother and dad, and despite that I know they and other family are there for me, it would be immensely helpful to have my girlfriend by my side while I go through this. The difficulty of course is the 3,700 miles currently separating us.

Her parents have offered to purchase either her tickets to see me in the US or me tickets to go back to Sweden whenever I am ready. I really feel like I need to see her as soon as possible right now because I am honestly a mess and while other family (and my dad and brother) are going through the same thing and are there to help, she gets me the most and I am just most comfortable with my emotions around her (my mom was previously that number one person). If I go to Sweden, I will feel guilty for “abandoning” my family, especially my father and brother, but it will let me escape the constant reminders of my mom and maybe let me grieve somewhat more easily (also because I won’t need to “be strong” for my dad and brother, as shitty and selfish as that is to say). If my girlfriend comes to America, she will have to experience the brunt of the situation (which she has some understanding of currently) with me and other grieving family, but I will be in a place where I can be there for family and they can be there for me. In the US, she would also be staying with my brother, father and me, as I still live with my parents, and I have no idea if they could grieve or would feel comfortable with someone else here and, although she says it is okay, don’t know if it would be good for her.

My girlfriend knows all the above and has said she is prepared for either and wants to support me no matter what. In her own words she said that she thinks we will suffer less together, however “together” may be. She is already a mess, stressed and crying over how I feel, and I feel horrible for dragging her through this. I want to run away to Sweden to her and her also amazing family to escape all of this, but I am overcome by guilt at the idea of leaving my own family without being able to support them and I know I also have to grieve. Conversely, I worry that her being in America will be too harsh on her (and us, being only a six month old relationship) and I feel selfish for so desperately wanting to be with her. I am at a complete loss. What should I do?

TL;DR: My mom died yesterday and I want to see my long distance girlfriend from Sweden, but I don’t know whether to leave home for myself or stay for myself (and family) and have her fly to America.

P.S. I love you, Mom. I wish I could have said it one last time in person. To anyone reading this, call your mom and tell her you love her. If you can, hug her too. It takes barely any time and you will both be happier for it. You just don’t know when it could be the last time."
66,"My fiance (31M) hates my (29F) sleep schedule. Am I in the wrong?


For as long as I can remember, I've always needed 10 to 12 hours of sleep. If I don't get it, I'm exhausted, non-functional and crabby. I know this isn't ideal, but I've been tested for most medical things it could be (thyroid issues, hormone imbalances, sleep apnea, depression etc) and have come to the determination that it's just how I am. I also function best at night. In addition, I really do just love to sleep, and prefer it to most leisure activities.

I work around this by working from home at night. I usually work from around 10pm to 4am, and go to bed right after. This puts me waking up between 2 and 4pm. My fiance gets up around 6am to work from 7am to 5pm. He gets home around 6, we cook dinner together and hang out for a few hours before he goes to bed, then I go to work. This schedule is fine for me.

What isn't fine is that he cannot STAND the fact that I sleep into the afternoon. The first thing he asks when he gets home from work is ""what time did you get up today?"" It doesn't matter what time I went to bed, or if there is nothing for me to have gotten up for. If my answer is after 10am, he's annoyed. It's especially bad on weekends when he is home to see how late I'm sleeping. We fight about it every single weekend. I've told him that if there is something he wants to do with me in the morning, he can feel free to wake me up and I'll try my best to be alert and engaged. He doesn't want to be responsible for waking me up, and also doesn't particularly have anything he wants me to be doing. Just not sleeping. 

We've gone to therapy about this, and because it bothers him so much, I've tried to change my habits, but it is incredibly difficult for me to sleep less, and when I do, I'm miserable. I want him to be happy, but I really don't want to stop sleeping as much as I do. I've even offered to take stimulants, as my doctor said he could prescribe something that's often given to narcoleptics/those with shift work disorder, since my sleep is affecting my relationship. However my fiance views this as ""cheating"" and says I just need to stop being lazy.

We don't have children, I'm not missing work, I'm making good money, I do most of the household chores. I know I sleep more than normal, but should this really be bothering him as much as it does? 

Tldr I feel like as long as I'm not shirking responsibilities I should be free to sleep as much as I want, but my fiance hates it."
67,"Husband (m, 44) and I (f38) together 10 years: he's angry all the time and I need advice


Tl;dr: husband always angry... I feel trapped. I need practical advice

 I have always loved my husband, but he has a horrible temper that goes with the superintelligent scientist stuff I've always loved about him. He's picky, irritable and likes things a certain way, but he's unique and interesting... And can be really supportive, especially when I'm trying to progress in my career. 

Lately he's been getting grumpier and grumpier... To the point that he screams and berates me publicly when I do things differently than he wants n me to, or I don't respond quickly enough to a request. Honestly, having a child made everything so much worse, because now I feel like I have two.

I have my own problems... Anxiety, and I can be withering and sarcastic (Which he hates)... But lately he screams so much... And in front of people - such I know I shouldn't care about, but it enrages me. I am not weak. I tell him I refuse to be spoken to like that and then he says he hates me, he wants a divorce, he's only with me because of our child etc. 

He cuts us off from people who disapprove of his rants. Now the couple the latest rant took place in front of are off the table as friends.

I'm so tired. I'm sick of worrying about what will set him off all the time. He has suggested counseling, because I think he can tell I've really had enough this time. 

Hes used to be nice for about a week after a bad rant,    and this latest one was just beyond the pale.  But these days he gets angry again a few hours later sometimes. There's not even a reprieve. 

He wants to move countries , but I can't think of a future with him. I can't even imagine having sex with him again. 
Our child is the best thing that's ever happened to us,, and he is a good dad, although I'm sure you guys hear that a lot.

We don't have money to maintain two households. I am scared to go to counseling because honestly I've written him off and I don't want to try to really make it work. It's always sone giddamn meaningless bullshit he says I've done, like using the last broad plaster that he wanted for his ankle, instead of a thinner one, because ""I should have known""... And other similarly bullshit stuff. He goes from saying ""oh he's an asshole"" to ""if only you didn't trigger me by doing X or y"". He blames the world for his bad behaviour. 

I have fucking tried not to ""trigger him"" Reddit . I even don't ever say you've done this etc I say ""I feel like"" etc. He would say I'm being manipulative here , or playing the victim... and it's true I am manipulative sometimes with him, trying to avoid confrontation. I will admit I do sometimes try to pretend I didn't mean something I said if it obviously upsets him because - duh! - I'm scared of his screaming and I hate it. I hate that I'm a coward this way, but he double loathes me for it. He thinks I play the victim. But really, if he didn't yell and scream etc, I wouldn't do it (I think. I mean maybe I am manipulative, but no one I known says it's a strong feature of mine or anything)

Honestly, I dont think he's capable of change. 

Is it worth trying?

Bear in mind, looking after a small child while we both work full time is back breaking work: splitting up I don't even know what I'd do. He does a lot of childcare, and a lot of laundry and cleaning. He's aggressive and verbally abusive, but he doesn't believe women are shit or he's above housework or anything. He's not the typical asshole in this sub! I feel like if he had microdoses. Of a sedative in his neck or something, he'd be less awful, and my life more bearable.  

But it's so so so shit right now. What should I do? Counseling? I don't even have time to look up divorce, let alone find money for two places.

My real two options here are not divorce or stay together. They are1) risk counseling to imagine I could actually fix this or 2) just continue living with him in misery and hope our child grows up soon or else one of us becomes wealthy enough for us to buy two houses. . I still love him. I wish a counselor could make us friends... Or just make him stop hating everything so much (not just me). 
Everything pisses him off so much. 


I'm so cut off from social anything. It's work and commute for 10 hours, then eke out those precious 2/ hours with my child. There's no decompress time, no friend time. We both spend all.weekend with our 4 year old because she deserves our attention. I don't mind if no one responds. I feel better having typed it. Maybe someone else out there has same issue and maybe got the guy the right meds or something. He is not evil. But I hate that when he feels pain, he hurts others. I resent him for it; I don't respect him and I feel like he can't control himself. I spend my life holding shit in and controlling myself and swallowing shit and getting screamed at at home... It's just too much. I'm so sick of it. I'm writk.g in my only free time, commuting home, and I dread seeing him. I especially drread him all of a sudden trying to be nice or giving me a gift, like a fucking dog dancing on his hind legs, acting like that's what he's normally like when we all know he'll be barking and yelling and biting on all fours in no time. 
Ugh!  I wouldn't say this stuff to his face of course. Our relationship is so precarious as it ism I feel better having typed this though. If it's something I can do that's obviousnyi you guys, please say so. He is very very clever, so any type of I feel X because you y stuff he knows about already. He will regards anything like that as a transparent attempts to ""manage"" him. 

Any advice, Reddit?

Tl;dr: husband always angry... I feel trapped. I need practical advice"
68,"Me [27F] getting stonewalled by my [29M] military BF?


tl;dr getting stonewalled where SO can talk about their life but if I try to talk about my life I get cut off.

I'm at my wits end. I've been dating a guy for about 5+ years total but we took a pretty large break in the middle and he's now been in the military (studying, no deployments yet) for a year now.

I just feel like I'm getting stonewalled by him. Like I can't talk about anything in my life without getting shut down. I try to bring up how I feel and he takes everything as criticism. Even going as far as to stop telling me about the things he's interested in so that he doesn't feel obligated to listen to me talk about the things I'm interested in when I ask for it. He used share all of his workout stuff &amp; marathon runs with me (even though I'm not a workout person) but I cheered him on and supported him. So after a few attempts of sharing some stuff going on in my life and getting shut down instantly I pointed it out that he shares his interests even though I get shut down when trying to share mine that seemed a bit unfair. His solution was to stop sharing his interests just to get out of listening to me talk about mine instead of actually letting me talk about myself some.

Like I don't expect him to *like* the things that I like, but is it wrong of me to at least expect to be able to *talk* about them? I try to bring it up politely like ""hey, I just want to talk about my project I'm working on for a bit and it would make me happy if I can talk more about my life"" Only to be reminded that he's not interested in my life/interests outright. ""I don't like (X)"". Even though I've been working very hard on (X). Even my friends who don't exactly like (X) personally as a hobby they partake in are very supportive when I talk about my accomplishments with it.

Not too long ago he essentially told me that I was like a stranger but I feel like it's because he doesn't give me any opportunities to talk about my life. All we mostly talk about is his life at his school or argue now. He also tends to spin it around like ""If I'm not giving you 100% of my attention you're unhappy!"" But I'm not asking for his attention all the time, I'm just asking for the ability to talk about things in my life because we never really talk about it as a subject matter.

I've tried to leave recently (he told me that if we married I would 'take everything of his and leave' while he was deployed) and he apologized for saying that. But I also was the one who took the long break a few years ago because he was blaming me for him not liking his job at the time and I couldn't handle it so since I left him then, I haven't been on good terms with his mom or anything. Everyone always treats me like I'm this terrible person for leaving him so I'm afraid to leave again. 

I really like him as a person but I feel like I'm treated unfairly a lot. Like I give him attention and support but if I ask for it back it's like ""STOP!"" It's really eating away at my mental health I feel like. 

He keeps telling me he doesn't want me to leave and that he gets through with everything because I have his back but I just feel like I need some support in return and when I bring it up as nicely as possible arguments start because to him I'm criticizing him. A friend suggested that he was essentially stonewalling me. I don't know. Since he's military I don't know if I'm just expecting too much of him now.

Unrelated but for a gift recently he bought me a CD for a band I don't listen to, but he does. I told him that I don't listen to that kind of music and he got offended. Maybe I'm just ungrateful. I don't know."
69,"Is the way I [25F] feel about my 3 year relationship with my significant other [21F] normal?


I’ve been with my girlfriend 3 years, and it’s my longest relationship (and only second serious one overall). I anticipated that the honeymoon phase would end, but I’m not sure if what I feel now is normal or not. I am not sure how heathy long-term relationships are supposed to function or how real life people realistically feel in them, because I grew up with very poor real-life relationship models and have realized I took a lot of unhealthy ideas about relationships from overly romanticized, unrealistic media. 

Basically, I feel like my feelings are frequently flipping 180 degrees. When we’re good we’re good, and I’ve felt for a long time that we would get married someday. But whenever we argue or she annoys me (sometimes over really stupid small things), I immediately jump to feeling like I want to break up with her. But I never do. Like recently, in a moment of anger, she said something genuinely mean to me. She apologized immediately. but I was still very upset and asked for space. The whole time I was thinking about, at the very least, asking for a break and how I would say it. But when I came to talk to her, genuinely all I wanted was to cuddle with her and forgive her, so that’s what I did. 

I am always worrying about what this tendency means — should we break up? Or could this be considered a defense mechanism and therefore somewhat normal for someone who struggles with handling conflict (I am working on it, but I hate feeling unsupported right distant from people as much as I hate being wrong, so being on either side of an argument is something that’s very difficult for me)?

I tend to always wants something different than I have. Therefore I also find myself wishing I could date around while I’m still young, but I know that when my friends talk about their dating experiences I feel so lucky I don’t have to deal with that. I also had years to casually date before this relationship if I had really wanted to, but never did because it terrified me! I am also analytical, introspective, and anxious, so I worry that in my effort to figure out what I should do or whether this is normal, I’m giving too much attention to thoughts that would otherwise be inconsequential. It’s like I can’t 100% commit to staying or leaving because I can’t trust what my real feelings and instincts are over anxiety or discomfort with conflict. Like, last week I was doing some very preliminary research on engagement rings, but here I am posting this question! 

Tl;dr: I love and want to be with my partner one minute and not the next. I’m interested to understand how others in healthy, long-term relationships feel towards their partners (especially during times of conflict) and how they interpret this tendency of mine."
70,"My (25/M) girlfriend (30/F) wants me to drop a friend (27/F) that I've known since high school for reasons that she can't seem to explain.


I've been with my girlfriend for a little over a year. She didn't seem controlling or anything at the start but for a couple of months now I've noticed that side of her starting to come out. It started when she tried to tell me what to wear and how to act. *Don't wear those jeans anymore. The ones I picked out for you look better. Always pull my chair out for me when we're out on dates. Your hair looks better when you push it to the side. I like you better without facial hair. I know we take turns paying for dates but can you hand the server my card when he comes back so he thinks it's yours?* Weird shit. None of my girlfriends have ever talked to me like that before. And for the record the jeans she picked out aren't even my size. 

About two or three weeks into this weird change in her personality, I brought my concerns to her attention and she said she didn't realize that it was a problem. She's used to picking out clothes for boyfriends even if they happen to have their own distinct style. I know she wants me to dress like I'm in a Banana Republic shop window but that's ... just not going to happen. That's not me. She knew that when she met me. If she wanted a boyband member, she shouldn't have agreed to go out with the tattoo artist that asked her out at a dive bar a little over a year ago. 

Anyway I have a friend that I've known since high school. We're not close in the sense that we talk everyday or even every week or month, but we know just about everything there is to know about each other. She has a boyfriend at the moment and she loves him a lot. My girlfriend has met her multiple times. At first she seemed to like my friend and got along with her pretty well. Same with my other friends. But slowly she has started to get really quiet around her and stare her down and give her one word answers when my friend tries to make conversation. I figured my girlfriend was just tired. But she later admitted that she feels I'm too close to this friend and that our friendship makes her uncomfortable ... even though we don't talk outside of group gatherings. And when we do talk, we always include our SO's and other friends. It's never just the two of us locked in. 

I will say that this friend is pretty. Maybe that has something to do with my girlfriend's discomfort. My girlfriend is also pretty. Beautiful in fact. But maybe some small part of her feels weird that I've had this pretty female friend for so long. A friend that was around for every life moment that I had growing up. When I asked my girlfriend about it, she didn't give me a clear answer. She just said, ""It's inappropriate and weird how close you are."" Again I had no idea what she was on about. I don't speak to this friend or hang out with her privately at all. Ever. And she has a boyfriend. When I asked what part of the friendship is inappropriate and weird, my girlfriend had no words. She just turned it into a situation where I should support her because I'm her boyfriend and that I'm gaslighting her if I say she's wrong about her interpretation. 

Had she given me a real answer to even just one of the questions that I had asked, I would at least try to understand. I'm still trying even though she was unclear. If she wants me to drop this friend just because she happens to be pretty, then I'm sorry but that's complete bullshit. I would never ask her to drop any of her friends. Not for any reason. That's one of the worst things you can do in a relationship. To me anyway. 

We had this conversation over the weekend and then again last night. She was still unclear. I truly just want to get where she's coming from. I would rather she open up and tell me if she feels insecure or something. But she insists that I'm in the wrong for not immediately doing whatever I can to make her comfortable again. I can only do so much when I don't understand the problem. I don't think that's unreasonable. 

Now we're in this weird place where neither of us knows what to say or do around the other. She's sleeping next to me in bed right now. I want to figure this out. But the more I think about it, the more I feel like she's just being controlling again and I guess I came here for outside opinions. 

Thoughts? 

**tl;dr** I hardly speak to this friend. We only see each other at group gatherings. And she has a long-term boyfriend. When I asked my girlfriend why this friend makes her uncomfortable, she was very unclear and basically just said that I should support her no matter what as a boyfriend. Not sure what to do about this. I'm not dropping a friend over something that I don't understand and that my girlfriend doesn't care to explain."
71,"My (23f) cousin (20) considers themselves gender neutral and wants to use they/them pronouns but is too embarrassed to tell me.


I’ll call my cousin Cameron. 

Cameron and I only see each other a few times a year because we live far apart. About 2 years ago, they started dressing more androgynous, and their mom (my aunt) told me that Cameron wants to be referred to with they/them pronouns. 

I was waiting for Cameron to talk to me directly about it so I could ask more questions, but they never did. For the past 2 years, I’ve just been avoiding pronouns (and stopped starting texts with “hey girl!”) but I’m sure I’ve said “she” every once in a while. My aunt said that Cameron is too embarrassed to ask me to call them “they”. 

Should I just start calling Cameron “they”? Should I bring it up with them?

I don’t have an issue with Cameron being gender neutral (neither does my mom or anyone else in my family) but I’m struggling with the grammar because “they” sounds like a group of people. 

TL;DR: My (23f) cousin (20) considers themselves gender neutral and wants they/them pronouns but has not asked me directly to. I’m struggling with the grammar aspect because using “they” to refer to 1 person is confusing. What should I do?"
72,"My [21f] friend [23m] stole over a dozen garlic bread and took weed I paid for and I'm not sure how I feel about him anymore?


This happened awhile ago but it's so bizarre to me. I'm sorry for my poor grammar. Also very long so tl;dr at the bottom. 

A few months ago my boyfriend and I asked my friend for a 20 bag of weed. He said he would get us a bag but it would be later on we asked around 4pm and he came around 9pm with a very small bag and wanted us to smoke some from HIS pipe.

I guess before I continue I should mention that I have known him since middle school we have never argued, never been ripped off from him, and we always had a pretty chill friendship. Never anything out of platonic so this took me by surprise that he would want to smoke from our bag in his pipe but whatever my bf and I just brushed it off trying to be nice. We only hit the bowl twice and he held onto it the rest of the time he was there which was 25 minutes (way shorter than normal.)

Suddenly out of no where he stands up, says he's gotta go meet up with some girl and asks my boyfriend for a ""pinch"" of weed that we just bought for his barely smoked bowl and to take to the girl. We were visibliy annoyed but my bf still wanting to be nice gave him some and my friend told me he was hungry and my grandmother had just finished making spaghetti and LOADS of garlic bread that was half a loaf each so they were really big and there was more than enough pasta so I told him to help himself and when he left my room to the kitchen my boyfriend and I talked about how weird it was that he was acting this way and how rude it was of him to ask for weed we paid for when the bag was already smaller than it should've been. We dropped it then just smoked and went back to playing our game just trying to brush it off.

Maybe like 20 minutes after I heard him eat and shut the front door suddenly we both hear a loud knocking at our window so I checked and it was him asking for his keys and water bottle that he had left in the room which I wasn't aware of til I saw them and I went outside to hand it to him. My boyfriend and I looked at each other confused wondering why he knocked on the window instead of just coming back in like normal if he left something but whatever... Again just brushed it off.

After we made sure he left my boyfriend wanted some spaghetti and 2 garlic bread pieces so I went to the kitchen and... To my surprise there is not a single piece of garlic bread besides a half eaten one.
I asked my grandmother if she put any up and she said no that they were in the stove and I told her to come check and yeah all of it was gone. She was surprised so was I, she swore up and down she didn't eat any and I know my boyfriend didn't because he never once left the room. So now I'm like what the fuck did he seriously take off with a dozen half bread loafs of garlic bread?! I tell my boyfriend and he's pissed and confused.
This is so out of behavior for my friend and I've never had anything like this happen to me, if he really needed food I wouldn't have cared to give him some on the go even though I know he made enough money to not be going hungry.

So what we figured was he took all the garlic bread to the car but realized he forgot his keys and was nervous to come back and be confronted for taking the bread. I'm not sure how the girl he supposedly was meeting was gonna like a dozen bread loafs and a half smoked bowl of weed but whatever.
He never said sorry or spoke to me again after that til recently he keeps trying to talk to me but honestly I just want to ask him why he did that and what was going on. Would it be wrong of me if I want to know why he did this or if I feel like this put our friendship in a weird light?

Tl;Dr
My friend stole over a dozen garlic bread from me and ripped me off a 20 bag of weed that he wanted some of for a girl. Hasn't talked to me or said sorry since."
73,"7 year relationship - fiancée wants a baby and now a month of no contact? (27)


Hi,

_Back story_

I’ll try keep this short as possible. I’ve been with my current fiancée for 7 years - we’ve been together since we were 20 years old. We got engaged last year in February. 

We’ve lived together in a rented house for 8 months a couple years back and moved back in with our parents in order to save money for our own house. (The landlord was also selling the flat we were renting) 

My fiancée has always been keen on having kids - for years. I’d like to have kids some day and she’s aware of this however she’s very much in her mind that she’d like to have kids right now - even without living together etc. 

She bought herself a house 2.5 years ago that she could rent out - I knew nothing about this, there was no discussion with me just straight up gave me a call and said I’ve bought a house I’m going to rent it out it’s not for us to live in. I thought this was crazy at the time told her how annoyed I was that she’d done this all whilst complaining about us not living together. 

I’d always told her I was going to buy a house at the end of this year.

_Now_

So she calls me 2 weeks ago, out of the blue I had no idea it was coming. She tells me that she’s upset because other people are having kids right now and she feels things aren’t moving for us. I told her I’m planning on getting a house this year like I’ve said. She asked me if I would have a kid right now to which I said let’s get a house in a few months, and then we can take it from there but let’s move in together first and be sensible about it. She couldn’t grasp that and kept saying she wants a kid now. 

She’s also going back to university to be a student for a year and wouldn’t have any income so to me having a baby right now with her going to university AND not living together is just complete madness and a recipe for disaster. 

So she comes to my house and she says she thinks we should just have a month of no contact because “maybe we take each other for granted”. 

She’s done something similar to this before where she went on a week holiday without giving me any reasoning at all and didn’t text or call me once - when she got back she said she needed some space. I was on holiday with a couple of mates which she was cool with but soon as I got back she went on holiday and ignored me - as some sort of punishment for being on holiday with my mates.

She was crying the other night when we spoke saying that she does love me etc but thinks it’s a good idea. She also said she was going on holiday for a long weekend last week and she’d let me know if she was planning on going - she didn’t.  She said we could meet up in a month and talk. 

I was completely blind sighted by all this I had no idea it was coming, we get on well and I do love her, we’ve been together so long and I can’t see myself with anyone else. 

However, my gut is telling me the reason she wants this break is to soften the blow as she doesn’t have the courage to outright break up with me. 

My thinking is she hopes that with us not talking for a month it’ll be easier for me to deal with. I feel like absolutely shit and feel like I’m stuck in some sort of emotional purgatory at the moment. 

Is it selfish of me to want to put ourselves in the best possible position first before having kids? 

I think I know the answer to all of this myself and I can see how this is going to pan out but just interested to hear other people’s thoughts. 

Should I just text her and say let’s just end it here - no point in waiting for a couple weeks to see anymore. It’s already emotionally suffocating me and depressing.

TL;DR

My long term partner wants a month of no contact and then to meet up. Is this just to soften the blow for now?"
74,"My [21F] boyfriend [21M] of 2.5 years is becoming a ""company man"" straight out of college and it's made him less considerate towards me as I face the decision of whether to follow him. Are we doomed? How do I deal with this?


**TL;DR: Amazing, loving boyfriend of 2.5 years has been at an internship at the company he will likely work for this time next year, becomes too busy for me. Is this temporary? Has he just spoiled me with attention before? Is this what a working adult relationship is like? Does work-life balance come with age? Are these major red flags that I need to consider before I prepare to move with him/marry him?**

I apologize if super similar questions have been asked before. I just really needed outside judgement/opinions on this specific thought process I’ve been struggling with—thank y’all in advance. Throwaway because I’m feeling self-conscious about this. Also, repost because I accidentally broke some minor rules--my bad, thank you to those of you who responded the first time around!

Boyfriend and I have been dating for 2+ years and were best friends before then—we have done all of college together and are going into our senior year. He's normally an *amazing* boyfriend, we get along great, we're both engineers, Christian, have similar career plans and have known since the beginning that we wanted to marry and how we've been progressing has only solidified that want. We've discussed this but have no certain timeline/plans yet.

**The problem: He’s been super busy working an internship this summer at a big company 3 hours away while I’ve been taking classes and I feel like I’ve gone from a priority in his life to an afterthought.** Don't get me wrong, I’m STOKED that he’s found a place he likes and, essentially, his first job (he's pretty certain he'll end up there after graduation). This isn't a career issue for me at all because there are plenty of potential employers for me in this city--I was actually super excited to live here with him before this summer. Lately, though, **I’ve realized what a disproportionately BIG priority work is in his life (very uneven work/life balance) and** ***don’t know if this is normal or if it gets better***. **And as I tentatively plan for a future with him, this is really important for me to have a grasp on.**

Things that have changed that make me worry (**you don't have to read these bullets**, I just wanted to provide some sound evidence cuz I'm an engineer and it be that way or just for those who are curious bc dang some of you guys on this sub are really thoughtful and thorough):

* Him being so ""wrapped up in"" events/presentations that he's forgotten our monthly anniversaries--sounds TOTALLY stupid, I know, but noting them was always a little thing that was important to him that he *never* missed before (the part that's worrisome is the change, not that he missed our whatever-th month anniversary, lol)
* He hasn't once invited me to come see him despite the short distance; however, he has come to stay with me once, though it was also to attend a mutual friend's birthday party
* When he visited, he kept texting a fellow intern who happens to be female. Which is great! I'm stoked he's making friends! However, he did it during our quality time (eating dinner I made for us--phone use during quality time has been a recurring issue we've been working though) and (this ESPECIALLY bugged me) hid his phone from me/turned it away so I wouldn't see their conversation even though I clearly saw who it was from. He knows I trust him/don't care in the slightest about who he's friends with.
   * He's also been watching the Bachelorette weekly with this girl and 2 others--is that weird??
   * Discussed this too, he chalked it up to ""being self-conscious about being on his phone"" since it's been an issue before, I choose to believe him. Still a noteworthy change though.
* We FaceTime often but briefly to catch up on our days; he's frequently gotten so caught up in his that he forgets to ask about mine before saying he needs to head to bed, something he's historically been good at.
   * Discussed this with him and he's been better, though often zones out for the \~2 minutes I talk, which is also unusual.
* Kind of a separate issue, but his current job and likely his future job will be in oil while he knows/admires that the whole reason I'm in this field to begin with is to \~save the planet\~ but doesn't want to change this because the money is good--in other words, he's likely selling out, could build resentment

I have NEVER had these issues (aside from the phone stuff) before.

I have read *so* many advice columns and threads in the Long Distance sub and I know that people don't fully develop until \~25 and that the transition from college to real life can ""make or break"" the relationship (so to speak) and I feel like I'm essentially approaching a fight-or-flight situation. Before this, I was pumped for the change. But I don't like how his transition has been going--I've always valued life outside of work MUCH more than how he has been but I've also never had an internship before so maybe I don't understand the pressure he's under and maybe I'm just being a baby because I'm not as busy as him right now. (But on the contrary, I don't know where to draw the line between being understanding and making excuses for him.)

**My fear is that I'll move to this city for him after graduation just to spend the rest of my life dealing with forgotten anniversaries, dates, promises to pick up kids, etc.**, and him staying late at work to keep impressing the bosses, spending all his time after work going to work events (he does work-related extracurriculars or just does stuff with fellow interns almost every day of the week).

Since I imagine many of the folks on here have undergone the college-to-working-life transition (and maybe even did it while in a relationship? Anyone?), I thought maybe it would help to ask you all **which of my fears are unfounded, which I should talk to him about, and which (if any) are red flags.**"
75,"My [32M] wife[31F] had an affair while pregnant. I feel broken and devastated.


Long time reader first time poster. Not sure what I'm looking for... I guess just advice and support. Hopefully this is the right subreddit.

&amp;#x200B;

I can't believe I'm posting this, it doesn't seem real and I've read similar stories before never imagining it could happen to me, but here it goes...

&amp;#x200B;

Quick backstory:

I first met my wife in Nov. 2006. I was 19 and a college sophomore. She was 18 and a freshmen. We have been living together for 11 years, owned our home together for 6. We have a 3 year old daughter together and found out she was pregnant in September 2018 with my son. He was born June 6, 2019.

&amp;#x200B;

Over the past couple months I've felt like we had both been distant from each other. I didn't think anything too bad... just not talking as much, having more smaller fights, generally just feeling ""off"". I felt rejected and unwanted a lot but blamed it on her being pregnant and just needing space. I think I started to feel this way around February when we had a somewhat big argument. We finally talked about some of these issues a couple weeks ago, how we had felt distant and she said she had felt alone and unsupported. I told her I understood where she was coming from, acknowledged I wanted to work on things, communicate more, and just be a better husband for her. I really wanted to work on things and make everything ""perfect"". I wanted her to feel like should could always talk to me and that I never wanted her to feel alone. I felt terrible for how she had felt without realizing there was such a problem. She wanted to start couples counseling, which is scheduled for Thursday. She had even said she noticed things improving and that I had really been trying since we talked.

&amp;#x200B;

Then, just 2 days ago. She admitted to me she started having an affair with a coworker in November which lasted until March. I was so shocked and in disbelief. I couldn't imagine her ever doing that. Especially while she was pregnant with my son. I feel so disgusted. I know things weren't perfect the last couple months, but I never realized there was an issue as early as November or bad enough to have an affair. I feel so hurt and betrayed that she was seeing someone else while we were a family together. We had family outings, buying each other christmas gifts, bringing our daughter to see santa at the mall, bringing her to her first haircut appointment together, her 3rd birthday. But during all of that time she was seeing someone else. It all feels like its been a lie, she put on a happy face and continued on like normal. I never would have guessed she was having an affair for those months. I know things between us weren't perfect, and there were times I could have been better and took her for granted, but I never could have never expected this. November is also when we stopped having sex. She told me at the time she was uncomfortable and worried about bleeding. I was disappointed but wanted to support her and didn't make a big deal out of it. But it turns out she was rejecting me because she was seeing somebody else.

After talking for the past day, shes told me shes felt alone and unsupported for a while, maybe for a year before the affair. I honesty never knew that was how she felt. I feel so destroyed and hurt that she never even talked to me that she had felt that way for so long. So betrayed that she was seeing someone else for months while putting on a show and acting like things were ok at our house. She said she started seeing this other guy because she felt connected to him, but distant from me for so long. It hurts that she could feel that way while we've built a family together and been together for almost 13 years. That she could so easily feel connected to a guy she only knew at work for 2 months but not her husband who was at home taking care of our house and daughter. I know I haven't been perfect and I can be distant at times, but I feel like I never did anything to deserve this. I honestly don't know what to do. I'm torn if I should give our marriage one last chance even though I don't know if I could ever forgive and trust her again. Or just call it quits and respect myself enough to not be with a cheater.

76,"My [26F] boyfriend [28M] won’t introduce me to his friends


I have a feeling I know what reddit is going to say here but I just need to know if I’m having unrealistic expectations or not.

I met this amazing man, we click on every level, and just generally have a great time together. We have been official for four months now and while I feel like I’m really falling for him there are major red flags that I’m not sure I can ignore (precious post is about not spending the night, if you saw that one, the trip to New York was fantastic, still won’t sleep over tho). 

So sleeping habits aside, he refused to introduce me to his friends, they know of me and have asked to meet me and he just says no. His excuse is that they are too judgey and he doesn’t want their opinions. I am not sure if I am taking it too personally but I feel very hurt when he goes out to open social things such as birthdays that are ideal places to into a S/O and I am not invited. I feel like I embarrass him or he is not being honest with who he is. 

For context he has already met all of my closest friends. 

Is it worth trying to talk with him again or do I just run at this point?

TLDR: My boyfriend won’t introduce me to his friends"
