0,"Update: My wife [28F] found out that my mother [59F] and I [28M] have been lying to her about our (me and my wife's) baby [0M] for months


Original: [https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/az648p/my\_wife\_28f\_found\_out\_that\_my\_mother\_59f\_and\_i/](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/az648p/my_wife_28f_found_out_that_my_mother_59f_and_i/)

Don't think anyone would particularly care about an update but I all appreciated the insight anyways. So here's an update:

After I wrote the original post, my mom took my son to stay overnight with my wife's sister so that the two of us could have the house to ourselves.

We pretty much just talked a lot while constantly reaffirming that we love each other a lot and want to sort this out. I apologized and explained why I did what I did. She said that feeling like she was there for our son's milestones was really just a band-aid solution that didn't actually convince her she was present. She said that if she actually *had* been using the milestones to feel like she was present, this would probably have felt worse for her. But since she wasn't, in her words, ""deluding herself into thinking she's actually home"", her main issue was that I lied which hurt her feelings. I apologized and explained that I honestly thought that she would prefer the lying if given the choice. She said she understood where I was coming from and that she felt betrayed when she realized, but she sees that I was doing it because I love her and she thinks we'll probably laugh about it with our grandkids one day (yes, I am very aware I don't deserve my wife).

Some things came out on my end that I wasn't going to tell her and didn't mention in my last post- namely, that I'm scared she's going to become suicidal. My uncle committed suicide when I was a child, in part from working in a high-stress job where he made a huge and costly mistake. One of my wife's colleagues attempted suicide while she was on mat leave. Being a working mom is bad enough, being a resident in this program is bad enough, both combined are a recipe for trouble. Since our son was born and the incident with her colleague happened, I've been afraid that if her home life wasn't perfect, it would push her over the edge. Anyways, she reassured me that that's not happening.

We ordered takeout and sat together watching the real videos I have of all our son's firsts. I also have a special folder of pictures/videos of my son with my wife, so we went through that after. She almost choked from laughing so hard when I tentatively revealed the beanbag trick. I am the laughing stock of her friend-group chat. So I guess we're already at the stage where we're laughing about it.

Thank you to those who responded to the last post! The stereotype of [r/relationships](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships) advocating divorce every time anything happens is true.

tl;dr: marriage is work. I am stupid. We moved past it."
1,"(Update) How do I (28f) break up with someone when I’m their (31m) everything?


[Link to original post. ](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/aab0wm/how_do_i_28f_break_up_with_someone_when_im_their/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app)

Straight to it: I broke up with him a day after I made my original post a few months ago. I was emboldened by the support and, strangely enough, even some of the negative comments. I came home from work and blurted it out, straight and to the point. I told him that I wasn’t happy, I hadn’t been for a while, and that we would be separating. We agreed that he could stay in the extra bedroom for a few months while we got everything sorted but when the lease was up we would be going our separate ways. 

The last few months have been hard. He went into full blown panic mode, promised to change in the ways I had waited years for, and had several actual melt downs begging me to stay. It was painful, but my resolve to live my own life never wavered. 

I just signed a new lease (by myself) and have begun to casually date someone in the same field as me. Life has an excitement to it that I haven’t felt in years, it’s like I’ve taken my first deep breath in a long time. 

So, if you’re on the fence about leaving someone but your lives are so enmeshed that you don’t see how it is possible: put yourself first, there is always a way out. Thank you! 

TLDR: I broke up with my codependent boyfriend and am the happiest I have been in years. "
2,"UPDATE: My boyfriend (30m) doesn’t want me (27f) to take a year off to travel.


 

[Original post here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/avemhj/my_boyfriend_30m_doesnt_want_me_27f_to_take_a/)

I  had a long conversation with him the night after this post and tried to  come to a compromise. I offered to cut my trip down to six months, with  the plan of him joining me for the first 2.5 weeks, and then I would  fly home to visit every 3-4 weeks after that. He asked if I would cut it  down to 2, though I felt that quitting my job wasn't worth only 2  months of travel, and he agreed with that.

We  both admitted that we had been inconsiderate. I expected him to be okay  with essentially putting our relationship on hold for a year, and he  apologized for never bringing up his feelings sooner and just assuming  that I would never go through with my plans.

In the end, it wasn't this trip that broke us up. It was all of them.

He  admitted to me that as much as he loves our travels in the past,  traveling itself is starting to lose its shine for him. He wanted to  focus on building his career and starting a family. He said he would  love to still take an international trip every other year or so, but to  places like the Caribbean or Europe, not the places still on my list  like Argentina, Vietnam, and Kenya. I tried to convince myself that I  would be okay with that. That I had seen enough of the world, and would  be happier with him at home than abroad by myself. But it wasn't true. I  know a lot of people won't understand choosing what they see as  trips/vacations over a relationship with someone they love, but  traveling is something I just can't give up. I would be restless and  miserable without it.

Neither  of us is wrong in this. We're just incompatible. After a long weekend  of crying to my mom, I'm beginning to feel better about the decision. I  know it's going to hurt for a long time, but I honestly believe this is  what's best for us. And even though I don't plan on flirting and kissing  my way across the world, I also feel lighter going on this trip without  a boyfriend to constantly worry about and try to stay connected with.

Thanks to everyone for your advice. Now, I've got a flight to book!

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR: I had been planning a year-long trip for a few years now but my boyfriend became uncomfortable with the idea once it was time to start booking things. We tried to compromise, but couldn't because we had different visions of our futures and decided to break up. "
3,"Boyfriend's (29m) parents (60s) let themselves into our house


I moved into my boyfriends house about 6 months ago and have been struggling to feel like it is ""home"". One thing contributing to this is that his parents who live down the street will come around about once a week while we are not there. Usually to do something useful like mow the lawn, take out the trash, feed the cat. One time the let themselves in while I was home because they thought I was out (my car wasn't in its usual spot) and I had just gotten out of the shower.

My boyfriend doesn't mind this at all.... This has been the status quo since he bought the house 7 years ago. They are very close and after all, they are just being helpful!

It bothers me because I would absolutely not accept this dynamic with my own parents. I feel judged if the house is a mess (his mom has commented before about the mess) and just on edge. I don't feel like I have control over my environment and I'd honestly rather mow the lawn myself if it meant reclaiming that zone of privacy. It's hard to articulate to him why it upsets me so much and I don't even know if I'm being unreasonable. I also see the other side.... And I don't want to cause tension between my boyfriend and his family. 

We have spoken about it and came to a compromise that they would not go upstairs and that bf would try to let me know when they were likely to come round so I could tidy up a bit. However, bf never spoke to them (he said they wouldn't go upstairs anyway so there was no need) and this morning his mom came over while we were out and he didn't warn me. He said that he doesn't always know if/when they will come. So I've basically been told just to live with it.

Should I just get over it? Is it normal for families to act like this? How do I approach this with bf? How do I draw some boundaries? What boundaries are appropriate?

**TL;DR - boyfriends parents come into our home, is this weird? How to I assert some boundaries? **"
4,"Husband (M39) escalated to throwing and pushing me (F41) - did I do what’s right?


This is my first real post to Reddit but I’ve read for a long time. I think people will be supportive but lots of people in my life aren’t so I’m reaching out here.

My husband and I have been married for almost 10 years and have 2 little girls ages 7 and 8. He has been verbally abusive to me for years in many ways: raging and throwing things, making me feel wrong a lot, complaining about my friends and their kids. I’ve told him that if he ever did this to the kids, he’d need to leave. In Dec, he lost his temper with the kids and said awful things like he hates them, they’re awful children, he wishes he could give them away. I asked him to leave and get help. He did and came back after 2 months.

Then he escalated to pushing and groping me, throwing scissors at me, and screaming. This happened where one of our kids could hear it. I filed a police report and they arrested him. I also filed for a 30 day domestic restraining order and I don’t want him to come back. I keep trying to remember that I’m the only one who can avoid creating a cycle of violence here.

With all of this, I feel so broken. The kids don’t understand, our friends think he deserves another chance, and I miss him. I logically know that this is abuse, but my heart wants to just try again. Life is really hard with him gone and I’m a mess. 

Thanks for your thoughts. 

TLDR: husband has been verbally abuse, escalated to physical, was arrested. Is it the right thing to hold on and not allow him back?"
5,"My (28F) boyfriend's (35M) friend (36M) keeps making me feel like I'm not welcomed in my own home.


 

This has been going on for a while. I've been living with my BF for two years. Before I lived with him, his friends would come over multiple times per week and play video games or board games, watch hockey and drink beer. Now, my BF doesn't feel the need to have them over as often as I play video game and board games, watch hockey and drink beer. His friends now come over once a week, but not every week. I don't mind when his friends come over, I really like most of them. I also love being home.

One of his friends, let's call him Sam, has been making comments about me being home when he and the other friends come over. He sighs when he sees me either sitting in the living room or I when come down the stairs. He has even made comments directly to my BF about me being there and not letting them have a boys night. My BF defends me every time and tells him that I live there and that I'm not going anywhere. He's also told Sam by text msg that he has to stop making these comments or he won't be invited back to our home.

This week, 3 of them came over to our house. Sam basically gets really drunk and proceeds to tell me that he can't wait for me to leave so that they can keep having boys nights. I wasn't leaving... I was home for the evening...I'm not much for confrontation, so I just basically just retreated to our room fuming without saying anything. My BF did not hear him this time and I had to tell him later.

Sam... is an alcoholic. Sam is an aggressive person when under the influence, but is a nice person when he's sober. I want to defend myself, but I know it's useless when he's drunk. When he's sober, he never remembers his words or actions when he was drunk. My BF wants to talk to him, but he also hates confrontation. He's been friends with Sam since grade school and knows he has problems. He's feeling very anxious about talking to him and he's been keeping to himself the last couple of days.

Should I be the one to confront to his friend? Or should I let my BF take care of it?

TL;DR My BF's friend keeps making me feel like I'm not welcomed in my own home. He's an alcoholic. He's has been warned about his inappropriate comments on my presence in my own home before.  "
6,"[UPDATE] My boyfriend [26/M] of 2 years doesn't trust me [33/F] since we moved in together


My last post didn't get much attention but I thought I would post an update.

https://old.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/ax5ov3/my_boyfriend_26m_of_2_years_doesnt_trust_me_33f/

Last night, I went out with a long-time guy friend for drinks. I had already told my boyfriend that I might be out late since I hadn't seen my friend in months and we had a lot to catch up on.

At 11PM, my boyfriend called me and told me that I needed to be home soon. I told him I didn't think I'd be back until 12:30, and he said it was OK then.

Fast forward to 12:45 when I get home, and he's sitting in the living room waiting for me a with a cold, menacing look on his face. He told me that my behavior was unacceptable and that I couldn't just stay out as late as I wanted now that we were a real couple and we lived together. I asked him about him staying out with a friend of his last week (who I'm pretty sure has a crush on him), and he totally flipped out on me. He told me that it wasn't fair for me to always be hounding him (I never have a problem with him going out with his friends), that I was being controlling, and that this behavior couldn't continue.

We had a lot of yelling and screaming, and I ended up walking out to stay at my cousin's apartment. I texted him this morning saying that it's over between us and that I'll come by to pick up my stuff. I still have to figure out how to get off the lease and make sure that he can't stiff me for the next 10 months' rent.

I've been crying since I sent the text but my cousin took a sick day from work and I'm trying to surround myself with friends and people who care about me.

tl;dr: boyfriend flipped out, got into a huge fight, showed his true colors, and I dumped him.
"
7,"[Update] (18F) My (18F) roommate is copying me.


Hi everyone! This is a follow-up on [my post from a few months ago](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/aatpzm/18f_my_18f_roommate_is_copying_me/).

The situation I described in the post escalated the longer that I ignored it. My roommate continued to copy seemingly everything I did or said -- little quirks of conversation with my boyfriend, my Instagram posts, clothing and accessories I bought, etc.  I also made a Depop to sell my clothes, casually mentioning it to her as a means of explanation as to why my half of the room was strewn with clothes before I had the chance to clean them up. Lo and behold, the next day, she made a page to sell her clothes.

So I finally said something. Specifically, I wrote a letter because I didn't trust myself to communicate the depth to which it was bothering me if I  addressed it verbally. So I wrote out my thoughts, proofread, sent it to a fellow journalism major/close friend to have him proofread it, and then sent it to her phone so she would see it when she woke up. I concluded the letter with an invitation for us to talk about the issue face-to-face. She replied that we could. I didn't see her for most of the day, and then at around midnight when I was already in bed getting ready to go to sleep, she decided she was ready to talk.

In her response, she admitted copying one of my posts, but denied all of the rest. She gave me excuse after excuse, essentially saying that seeing what I was doing reminded her of ideas she had already had. She then said that it was hurting her that I didn't talk to her as much anymore, which I had already addressed in the letter by saying that I felt I couldn't trust her anymore. In short, she seemed to be trying to play the victim and refuse accountability, which frustrated me but did not surprise me. The next day, I took her off my social media so that she could no longer see what I was doing. That seemed to really bother her, but she didn't address it in person.

One day, I was gone all day because I was at Disneyland with a friend from out of town. Apparently that day, she went to our RA and requested a meeting between us. I messaged the RA privately and said that I would prefer my roommate try to address things with me privately before getting someone else involved. Though I didn't say this to our RA, I felt that having a meeting with a ""mediator"" would enable my roommate to continue hiding behind an ""authority"" figure instead of addressing conflict and criticism as an adult. However, I just tried to frame it as an issue of my own comfort to avoid escalating things.

About two weeks later, she moved out of our room and into a different room in the building.

I'm not really bothered by the way this played out. Now I have a room to myself, which is fine by me. I have continuously heard from people who know her that she has been saying negative things about me or even lying about me. One of my coworkers is close friends with her new roommate, so I heard through the grapevine that my roommate had said I ""yelled at her about copying me."" I don't really know how a letter gets translated to yelling, but I find it ridiculous and pathetic that she has to try to make me look bad to win pity. I'm done giving it my attention, because I honestly just feel like she's someone else's problem now.

Thank you to everyone who offered me advice! I'm happy with my own decision to stand up for myself and I see my ex-roommate's response to the entire situation as a reflection on her own maturity level.

TL;DR: She moved out because I confronted her. "
8,"Husband is pissed about my secret savings


My husband refuses to save money. If I put money in our savings he immediately will take it out. 

I opened another savings account at our bank in my name. On the weeks MY payroll comes in I’ve put 50/75/100 in my savings after all the bills were paid.

Well lo and behold he had 1500 in unexpected car repairs this week. He used half of my payroll and deferred the rest of the work. Leaving us with $5 until his next payroll in a week.

So I transferred the money from my secret savings and he hit the roof that I’m lying and hiding HIS money (mind you only put extra from my payroll aside), why doesn’t he have access etc.

I told him I’m not so nice words to get bent and that he should thank me for setting money aside for these situations since he refuses to save. ( he also refuses to take lunch from home and hits up Taco Bell, etc 2x a day meanwhile I grocery shop &amp; take a lunch - I even walk home from work 3x a week to save money). 

Am I wrong for having my secret account?

TL;dr - husbands mad I had a secret savings that saved us this week am I wrong?"
9,"After 13 years, I (34M) have had it with my wife's (34F) laziness.


She doesn't have a job and doesn't care to look for one. I don't think she's worked since before we got married. We have two kids ages 4 and 6, but she's not a stay at home mom. She's just a stay at home facebooker, binge eater, and sleeper.

I work 9 hour days with only Sunday off. Money is tight but we make it work. Of course, her getting a job would help tremendously. Even her actually being a parent with all her free time would help me out. At least 90% of the child care, housework, and errands falls to me. I love my kids of course and have no belief that caring for them is a woman's job or anything. It's just the fact of the matter is I'm often exhausted when I get home. Then I make dinner, help with homework, bathe the kids, do their bedtime routine, and clean up the kitchen while my wife has been home all day and done nothing but surf the internet. Each morning I also make sure they're up and dressed on time, make them breakfast, ensure they have everything for school, and see the 6 year old onto the bus and drop off the 4 year old at preschool on my way to work.

No matter how much I clean and try to keep things organized, I can't stay on top of the mess. Even if I spend a Sunday doing every chore you can think of around the house, by the end of the week it's back to looking like a tornado blew through it. It's not just normal ""kid mess"" either, that's actually the smaller part. Most of it is piles of dirty dishes, trash from my wife's constant snacking on junk food, stains, spills, crumbs, and dirty laundry. It's been taking a toll on my mental health because I don't feel fully comfortable in my own home. Even our bed constantly has crumbs and candy wrappers in it. I can't relax watching tv with a mountain of her unwashed clothes next to me.

Her typical day looks like this: Wake up at 10am or later. The kids and I get up around 7, she's still sleeping when I get to work at 9. Go on her computer in bed until it's time to pick up 4yo from preschool, which is 12:30, but she's usually late because she can't get offline in time. Get home, throw something in the microwave for 4yo's lunch. Back online until I come home at 7. Then she eats whatever I made for dinner (or ordered, on the bad days). As I'm doing things the kids need after dinner she hardly ever offers help. Instead is on the computer or her phone, arguing on facebook and chatting with internet friends. Goes to bed long after me (I go around 10 or 11, she comes in way past midnight).

She resents having to pick up 4yo too because she's ""still tired"" by that point in the day. It's literally the only thing she has to do!

What else? The internet use -- I know a lot of it is facebook but it seems very addictive to me. She's obsessed with politically-oriented groups on there and is often involved in some sort of drama. Even during the night her phone is lighting up with notifications. From what she talks about, it sounds like there is a lot of bullying in these groups over very insular ideology even if the group is just for something like sharing dog pictures. I find the entire thing really juvenile if I'm being honest.

As far as I know she's not doing anything like cheating online. I don't know exactly what she does besides facebook. Don't really care either. I wish she would spend more time in real life.

The mess around the house -- I've reminded her of this over and over, it never sticks. Or it gets better for a few days and then slides back to how it was. Her constant snacking is extremely grating too. She's almost always stuffing chips or candy in her face and believe me, after several years of this habit, it shows. On top of that she only bothers to shower a couple times a week. The food and soda spills sometimes have attracted ants by the time I find them. It's nasty, our kids have expressed disgust at it too.

On that last note -- the kids also are starting to pick up on her lazy mentality. My 6yo asked me why so many people go to work, ""when they can just stay home like mom."" She technically doesn't allow them to have the garbage food she eats but that doesn't stop them from trying to sneak it. If she catches them, she yells at them. If she doesn't, well, who knows how much unhealthy food they're managing to get? I counteract as best I can by cooking healthy balanced meals, which they do eat, and making sure they get plenty of active play time. I'm still very worried about how her careless attitude towards eating and health could influence them. They have me as one role model and then her as the exact opposite.

There's probably a lot I've left out but just writing this out has exhausted me.

Today I vacuumed, scrubbed countertops, did all the laundry including her own, all while she sat on facebook and read angry clickbait articles. I still managed to spend some of the afternoon at the playground with our kids. No, she didn't want to come along. I don't even bother to ask anymore. I know the answer.

What finally pushed me to post for advice is when it dawned on me tonight that I don't think she said a word to either child all day. She's completely absorbed in her own world. It is so abnormal and unfair to them. I can't deal with having this checked-out blob of a person for a wife anymore. My kids must deserve better.

Where the hell do I go from here? I feel like I finally achieved clarity of how bad the situation is, but now I'm facing this massive mountain and don't know what the first step even looks like.

Also, I admit I posted about these issues last year, and nothing has changed since then. The post didn't get much attention but I feel like I should have done more. Well, better late than never I suppose...

TL;DR: My wife is perfectly content to wallow in a lazy lifestyle that includes not working, not putting any effort into the household, ignoring our children, gorging throughout each day on sugary crap and packing on 200+ pounds, addicted to internet drama, makes messes that she doesn't clean up, makes excuses when confronted, and overall leaves me to do her share of almost all the work that being in a marriage and family requires."
10,"Me [26F] trying to be okay with boyfriend's [32M] relationship with his best friend [26F]


 

We have been dating for nearly 4 months now and it has mostly been great. He is very emotionally available, supportive, sweet and a lot of fun to be around. We have a great time together, and I feel very comfortable around him. His best friend has been the only problem in our relationship so far. He has generally been pretty honest about his relationship with his her, but I'm still feeling very uncomfortable about it.

\- When they met about a year ago, he developed feelings for her which she apparently didn't return. They did end up becoming very close friends.

\- She doesn't really have any other friends apart from my boyfriend. She recently got injured pretty badly and has become very depressed. It feels to me that she is depending on him too much, and he feels responsible for her happiness/wellbeing.

\- They text each other constantly and have cute nicknames for each other... basically very specific pet names they only use with each other. He also refers to her as ""dear"" and ""sweetie"" a lot. I told him this makes me uncomfortable, he said he's sorry but he's not going to stop because it will ""sabotage"" their friendship.

\- They do date-y things together, but it so far he doesn't tell me about it until after they have happened. Examples:

1. In december they went to a theme park together. I knew he was going to the theme park, but when I asked him who he was going with, he made it sound like he was going with one of his male friends that he met up with. He stayed the night at her house and I didn't know about this until 2 weeks later.

2. They are going to a concert together. He told me he got tickets for that concert, but when I asked him who would join him he said it was just going to be some of his concert buddies. Only yesterday I found out that he is actually going with his best friend. (He was upset because she might not be able to make it. He hasn't asked me to join him (He knows I really love the band.))

3. He planned to take her to a musical, just the two of them again, but I only know this because I accidentally saw him text her about it and he didn't actually tell me.

4. The only time he was upfront about seeing her, he told me that he went to her house all day and they hung out, talked, played games and had dinner together.

Am I crazy or do I actually have something to worry about here? I have been the ""paranoid girlfriend"" before and I'm trying really hard to be cool with it but the lying by omission thing is really bothering me and making it difficult to trust him. I plan to talk to him about it tonight, but I don't know what to tell him without sounding crazy jealous. (Which I guess I am, but I want to be rational and mature about it.)  


TL;DR: Boyfriend is close friends with a girl he has had romantic feelings for in the past; has been lying through omission about doing things with her. I'm paranoid. Help?"
11,"[update] Height/Size difference... how to be ok with it?


Just thought I’d share what happened. Me [28F], him [28M]

Link to previous post: https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/ataesr/heightsize_difference_how_to_be_ok_with_it/

After reading some great positive comments- it really helped me block the issue out of my mind, we went out a few times after and it honestly bothered me less every time, and I’d go as far as to say it doesn’t bother me any more. 

Wellllllll, it turns out my size bothered him. I guess I went through some serious inner turmoil for nothing. I thought it was shallow of me to even have those thoughts of feeling like a giant... but I guess that’s what he was thinking too. A sad ending. 

Thanks everyone for sharing your happy stories, and I’m a bit disappointed this couldn’t be one- I still think he’s great just as he is, shame he doesn’t feel the same about me. 


Tl;dr he wasn’t ok with my size either. "
12,"My wife [28F] found out that my mother [59F] and I [28M] have been lying to her about our baby [0M] for months


This all went down about an hour ago and my wife is still crying in our bathroom with the door locked. 

Backstory: We had our son (now 11 months old) while my wife is in residency. She took a few weeks off before giving birth, and then went back to work a few months after, while I transitioned my hours to part-time so that I could stay at home and raise our son. My mom moved in with us shortly after the birth in order to help out, which allows me to get in the few hours of work per day and also not get swamped with taking care of the baby/housework. She's quite old-fashioned and would definitely not prefer this arrangement with me being a stay-at-home dad, but she hasn't said anything to either of us and has been a great help.

For anyone unfamiliar with medical residency, it is *brutal*. My wife has just over a year left. Sometimes she comes and goes for 1-3 days and our son is asleep the whole time she's home, which has been happening more as his sleep schedule shifted to sleeping through the night. My mom and I make sure that when she's home and the baby is awake, my wife gets him 100%. I know it's been hard on her, but unfortunately it's just going to be this way for another year.

The first big milestone she missed was him rolling over. When she got home, my mom pulled her over to the baby all excited. I thought she was going to tell her, but instead she says ""Julie, you came home right on time! He's been moving about as if he's going to roll over!"" They both stood there encouraging him, and right on cue he rolls. My wife was *elated*. She was so worried and guilty about not being there and she took it as proof that she can still be a present mother while working. 

So we continued. I send texts over little things she misses through the day so that it's not completely unbelievable, but my wife has been 'present' for every single BIG milestone. He coincidentally started crawling with her right there, his first words were in front of her, and he began standing, cruising, and walking when she happened to be home. The walking one was difficult- there was a tough 7 day stretch where she just wasn't home during the daytime when he was awake, and his walking went from teetering to walking a couple steps pretty confidently in that time. We put little beanbags in one of his pants pockets so he'd be wobbly and unbalanced and it looked believable since he fell after the first step like he was doing a week ago. Yes, it was mean to our poor son but my wife's face was worth it.

Today it all unravelled. So far he can just say 'mama', 'dada' and 'nana'. Yesterday he started saying 'bye-bye'. My wife has today off and has been home all morning. My mom and I have been trying to get him to say bye all day without giving it away that we already know he can say bye. Successfully got him to say bye to the ducks at the park, and we both gushed over his newest word the whole way home. My wife was using my phone to take pictures of him and began showing my mom at home while telling her about his newest word acquisition. She was swiping through my gallery and saw a video from yesterday and goes ""oh you never sent me this one!"" It was literally like a slow motion film happening in front of my eyes. I had taken the video of him yesterday waving bye-bye.

My wife isn't an idiot. She figured the whole ruse out pretty much instantly. I've never seen her look so upset and heartbroken before. I couldn't say or do anything to comfort her. Now she's locked herself in the bathroom crying and won't come out. I'm on our bed hoping someone can please tell me what to do to make this better.

&amp;#x200B;

**tl,dr:** my mom and I lied to my wife about our son's milestones for months, and she just found out.

13,"Me [22F] with my boyfriend [22M] of ~2 years, his sleep “schedule” is impossible to plan around.


Both he and I are night owls but during the week I go to bed reasonably early to get in my 8 hours. He goes to bed whenever which I don’t mind. However, he doesn’t adjust his sleep schedule on the weekends which means that every weekend day begins at nighttime— too late to do a myriad of things I’ve been asking / planning (with his knowledge) for us to do each weekend.


To be clear, I don’t expect all the effort from him. Every weekend I stay up much later than weekday schedule in order to spend the extra free time with him/ to do weekend activities that go deep into the night. He just doesn’t put the effort in to do similarly so that we can do things during the day.


This week in particular, I asked him a couple days in advance if he could start adjusting his schedule as it’s supposed to be a nice weekend but instead he stayed up later. My only good chunks of free time in the daylight are completely wasted each week and it’s starting to wear on me. I also don’t have many friends to call on and even if I did, I hugely value spending this time with him.
I’ve mentioned this many times, told him what it meant to me, we’ve talked about if he thinks he should start inplementing sleep aid techniques but he doesn’t care when he goes to sleep which is starting to sound like he doesn’t care about spending time with me. He says to just wake him up but obviously 2 hours of sleep doesn’t make him a great companion to the day’s activities.


TL;DR How do I impress on him that I need him to be awake during the day sometimes?"
14,"My (30M) extended Family (Various) forced me to be the sole caretaker of my grandmother (91F) 3 years ago and it's destroying my life.


About 3 years ago, my uncles moved my grandmother out into a retirement community (not a care home, just a seniors only gated community) a few miles from me. I'm the only relative she has in this state and within 700 miles. The gist of it is that they decided that since I am self employed, that meant that I could take care of her until she died. I had no knowledge or consent of this until it was happening, and put into the position of leaving my grandmother, who I do love, alone and unable to do anything for herself (cannot drive, progressing mental degeneration) I started taking care of her.

Her condition has degenerated massively in the last year. She at this point has extreme memory issues. Wild emotional swings. She can barely feed herself and when she does she eats like an animal, no utensils, just hands. She also needs constant medical assistance. Her skin is fragile and tears easily, and she can't stop herself from removing the bandages and making the injuries worse, so she needs to be monitored.

As a result of this, I've become unable to maintain my business properly. I'm nearly broke, and physically I'm constantly exhausted as I'm spending days trying to handle her various issues and then going home to work on my business until 2 or 3 AM so I can get up and working by 9 the next day.

I have no social life anymore. My health is in the toilet.

I approached my family about putting her in a care facility about 9 months ago, and was told that if I did I better pay for it, and that I would be essentially disowned by the family. One person alluded that I'd be reported for elder abuse.

What should I do? I can't afford to keep going and I can't afford to put her in a home by myself, and everyone else is refusing any form of monetary assistance either way.

TL;DR - Family dumped my non-independent Grandma near me in my state and guilted me into taking care of her, and now she's in far worse shape and it's ruining my life, but none of them will assist with her care or in getting her in a nursing home."
15,"35F with fiancee 36M. It doesn't feel worth it anymore.


My partner and I have been together almost 3 years with plans to marry next February. We have a blended family with three kids 12 &amp; under between us.

His kids came to live with me &amp; my daughter a few months in to the relationship. They had previously been removed from their home by child services for truancy &amp; mom's drug use (he wasn't living there at the time) and were temporarily living with his mother. I went through the process of having myself and my home approved to house them, and we eventually graduated out of the regular check in program. He had to complete an anger management program. I began providing for them and taking care of them as if they were my own. We continue to split all living and childcare expenses for all three kids 50/50.

I love them, but my life is complicated and stressful. There is no contact with the birth mother. A few months ago we finally began receiving what little child support the state skims off her server paycheck, but she is behind on payments, and makes no effort to see them or help out. She has another baby (not his) and is on government assistance.

He has worked at the same restaurant for nearly 17 years. At one point I interpreted this as loyalty, but it's beginning to feel like complacency. In the time we've been together I took a better job that gives me more family time with a 9-5, M-F schedule. On Sundays, he works 12 hour shifts and I'm simply worn out at the end of the day.

I told him from day 1 that I was happy to open my home and heart to his children but that I didn't want to commit to childcare every Sunday. His initial answer was along the lines of ""I don't have another choice."" It's my fault for accepting that answer and trying to be the hero. I have continued to express my frustration and a better solution never materializes. His mom will do a half day sometimes, and I appreciate that. My friend had some great suggestions about finding local childcare, but I feel he should be sorting this out and I feel taken advantage of because it's just easier for him to let me handle it.

It's not just watching them - it's emotional support, discipline, getting them to do chores...I feel I have accepted the role of primary provider of these things and I'm not sure he knows how or thinks he can. When I try to talk to him about it, his response is, ""I don't know how to talk to little girls."" That doesn't feel fair to me.

Here's a concrete example. This past Saturday night my close friend turned 30 and had a party. He's also moving soon so it was a way to go out and sing karaoke and just be with him and some girlfriends. I was gone from 7 to 9:30. I had asked to go a week prior. We've had problems in the past if I go out without giving him enough notice.

At 9:30 he picked me up on the way to take the kids to the trampoline park. My kid got hurt there and cried/whined more than seemed necessary, so I suspected she was hungry. Apparently they hadn't eaten dinner yet. We had promised them a jump all day, and he scoffed at my suggestion he take them while I went out. They didn't get to eat until after 11 pm. So while I'm comforting my kid, on an event for her birthday, he's out in the car taking a kid break because they were apparently annoying him in the car.  To me it felt like he was acting out because I was going out and being social.

We did talk things out and he said he'd try harder to do more. I said I wanted time to hang with my friends - no more than a couple days a week, and only on days I don't have my kid (I timeshare 50/50 with her dad). So, I thought we reached an understanding and was feeling kind of hopeful.

Well today my girlfriend texted for happy hour. I texted him to let him know. I could tell he was pissed because he criticized that I hadn't texted him enough during the day and the next message he gets is about meeting a friend. I had a super busy day with multiple projects and I really expected him to be supportive given the conversations we'd had. I told him so. He said I was misreading him and that he was only concerned. That made me angry, I don't know why, maybe I'm just fed up at this point, maybe he was trying to gaslight me, it just felt like bs.

When I got home he was mad. I tried to avoid conflict, and keep my distance. He kept on so I said I was sorry for misinterpreting him (I didn't really mean it, but I was trying to appease him and chill after a long day). I told him I just wanted to rest and browse Reddit. He demanded to talk and I told him I didn't want to. Then he knocked my phone out of my hand. I hate it when he's like this - he just says my name over and over and I feel like I have to help him feel better.

I know we love each other. I thought I finally found a person I could grow old with. In the long view, kids are temporary and they're stressful and they will eventually grow up. But I'm starting to wonder if it's worth it anymore. How do I talk to him and sort out if this is worth fighting for? How do I talk to the kids? How can I ask for what I need?

TL;DR I'm worn out from being stepmom and the way he's treating me makes it not feel worth it."
16,"Update: Found out that before I (19M) met my girlfriend (20F) I hooked up with two of her best friends (21F) and I'm afraid of bringing it up.


First of all thanks to the people who helped me out last time, here's the thread: https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/awk4h3/_/

After some thinking and gathering A LOT of courage I told my girlfriend we needed to talk. She was pretty confused and already knew something was up, because she notices that kind of stuff. I started off with saying that she means a lot to me and that I love her (I don't know if this was too soon or not but it seemed like a good time in the moment). She immediately told me she loved me too and we hugged, felt pretty damn good.

I told her that I had something important to tell her and that it would probably hurt but to please hear me out. She looked pretty concerned at this point but I carried on. I said that prior to meeting her, I had some encounters with her friends A &amp; B but that it's in the past now. She didn't understand and looked even more confused and I got embarrassed as hell, but told her straight up that I had met both of them through Tinder and that we did some stuff. She looked at me in disbelief and stammered a bit and asked me if I was joking.

Unfortunately I wasn't, and I carefully explained her what happened and she went quiet again and just looked at me. I noticed she was on the verge of crying so I hugged her, and she bursted out in tears. She hugged me very tight and it honestly broke my heart, I felt so so terrible. I held her for a long time and eventually she calmed down, and asked for the details. I didn't really want to talk about this but she really wanted to know so I gave in. She probably would have found out from her friends anyways so I told her everything. I doubled down that it meant nothing to me anymore and that I was with her to stay, and that I only want her and nobody else. She told me it was okay but that she needed some time to process it, I told her I would do anything to help her. We ended up cuddling all night and watching some Netflix, later she told how much she appreciated it so there's that.

She got a little bit emotional a few more times the past week but she handled it like a champ. Made sure to show her that I loved her many times and took her out to dinner. The party was yesterday and that went OK too. A had no clue it was me and we were pretty awkward together. B had her suspicions and was really cool about it. Ended up talking with her for a great deal of the night and it was nice to catch up, she handled it way better and we shared some laughs. Afterwards my girlfriend told me she would prefer it if I didn't interact too much with B which is completely understandable, shouldn't have done that in the first place but definitely not doing that again. Overall I think it went pretty well and I'm so glad I told her myself, it could have gone way worse. Thanks y'all, cheers to a happy ending. I feel a stronger bond with her for sure.

TLDR: Ended up telling her about my experiences with her friends, her first reaction was pretty bad but eventually she calmed down. Party went OK, I definitely feel a stronger connection now. Girlfriend is a champ."
17,"Update: My (29M) wife (26F) suddenly decided she wants to adopt a baby


Original post: [https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/aw0vsd/my\_29m\_wife\_26f\_suddenly\_decided\_she\_wants\_to/](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/aw0vsd/my_29m_wife_26f_suddenly_decided_she_wants_to/)

I wasn't thrilling with the idea for obvious reasons and she even introduced the baby to our son as his new little sister. That was all sudden, I wasn't prepared and it felt like she was taking a life-changing decision in our lives without me (and she was), but I spent a lot of time thinking about that and realize that if she asked me for adopting (not like this, bring up the idea and discuss the possibilities), I'd probably agree and I'd probably also agree if she wanted to get pregnant again. So yesterday I asked her to talk and told her that I was positive with the idea, she was really happy, she loves this kid for real and the fact that she was the same when our son was born also made me realize that I didn't have much to say against it.

Today we talk with the parents, the mom just wants to live her life without caring to this baby (I don't think she has any motherly feelings for this baby) and was completely ok with us adopting her, the dad was different, he accepted our offer too, but was reluctant, I can tell he feels sorry for not being able to raise her (I hope he can manage to be a part of her in the future when his life be more stable). Both of them agree, tomorrow we'll look for an adoption agency and try to make things quickly as possible.

Things are going well, I just don't know how long will take to me raise some father feeling for this baby, my wife definitely thinks she's the mom now and sees her as her own child, that's sure. I'll do my best to be a good dad for her, the same way I am for my son. This was all sudden, but I have an amazing family and don't should complain.

 **tl;dr**  We're adopting."
18,"My (22M) friend (24F) is being forced to marry a family friend (35M) that she hates. What advice can you guys give her?


So my friend got a call from her mum today basically telling her that she arranged for her to marry a family friend. The guy is rather successful as his family owns a hotel and a couple restaurants, and has been in love with my friend for years. 

After she rejected him, he pulled some strings and got his mother to arrange a marriage with her mother. As he is very well off, her mother is now forcing her to marry into his family for money. 

She has talked to him about not wanting to marry him, but he does not seem to care about what she wants at all, and said (verbatim) ""I dont care as long as youre mine"".

Her mother also seems unresponsive of what she wants and thinks shes doing her a favour by setting her up for life.

We cant think of what she should do, so im turning to you guys for advice. Any help is appreciated.

tl:dr guy pulled some strings with his mum to make her arrange a marriage with my friends mum. As hes very well off, her mum is now forcing her to marry him for money, even though she hates him."
19,"Partner (34M) doesn't want me (32M) at his work dinner, attended by other couples, because he doesn't want to ""draw attention""


For the record, we've been together for 8 years. Partner has never been super comfortable with being openly gay (one of those ""I don't advertise it"" people)… I don't put pressure on him because I know it's not always easy, and besides we're out to close friends and family, so it's not like we don't have any support in our lives.

However, this recent thing we've fought over seems ridiculous and transcends the whole private/professional divide. In short, partner's boss is organizing a small gathering to celebrate 10 years of her firm. In my partner's own words, it's nothing fancy, just a casual dinner with the employees and their friends/spouses. I've previously met his boss and though partner didn't expressly say who I was, she very obviously knew. Both his boss and co-workers are aware he's in a relationship, though I don't imagine he brings it up that much because of the whole ""I'm a private person"" mantra.

With that said, when I started asking him details about the dinner so I could plan my schedule around it, he suddenly became very vague and avoidant. I finally confronted him yesterday because I could see something was wrong. He apologized and told me it'd probably be a mistake for us to go together because it would just draw the unnecessary attention. I'm putting it concisely, but that's his own wording. We had an ugly argument, and it wasn't entirely about the dinner but that was the catalyst. Bottom line is, he doesn't want to be seen as ""the gay guy"" at his workplace. Despite the fact that a lesbian co-worker will be attending the event with her partner (but according to him, it's easier for women to be accepted as gay). I was angry and called him a paranoid asshole, which I do regret. In any case, we didn't share a room last night and he left earlier than intended today to help with his sister's move. We have yet to talk.

So I've had time to think and realized this goes beyond the whole dinner or work thing. My partner is in his mid-30s now, does he intend to spend his entire life in panic over who might know he's gay? Not to mention that this affects me as well. I'm not sure what to do in practical terms. I'm thinking of suggesting couples' therapy when he comes back home tonight, because as I've said, this is a pattern (although knowing him, he'll probably deny it). Though I'd appreciate any other advice or thoughts? I've never confronted this issue of ours head-on.

**Tl;dr:** Partner and I got into a fight because he doesn't want me at his office event for friends and family of employees. In short, he doesn't want to explicitly let his co-workers know he's gay, although they know it implicitly. This behavior goes beyond the current issue and I'm not sure what the best course of action is."
20,"My husband (28M) lied to me (28F) about the origin of our future daughter's name. His ex came up with it.


My husband and I have been together for several years, and it's been a great relationship. We've had our ups and downs, but we've worked through them. One issue we had was his lying. He would lie to make situations better than they were, to not get in trouble, to not hurt my feelings, etc. We had long talks about it, and it seemed to have stopped. I told him how much the lying hurt me and made our relationship weaker. I also told him that I was done with it because it made me feel crazy when I could swear he was lying, but he would insist that he wasn't, just to find out that he was. 

&amp;#x200B;

He said that he was done lying because he could see how much calmer and more secure I was when he was telling the truth. 

&amp;#x200B;

A little backstory: When we started talking about kids and names about 2 years ago, he said that her had a specific name picked out for a little girl. I'll just say it's ""Addie Mae."" I loved the name and agreed. We both want a family, so ""Addie Mae"" has come up a lot in conversations, as have ideas for boys names, number of kids, etc. We are so excited to be parents, so it's not like we said it once and dropped it and never spoke of it again. We talked about it a lot. 

&amp;#x200B;

Currently: Lately I've been feeling like something is off. I had a feeling that he was lying about his ex contacting him, so I did some snooping. I'm not proud of it, but it was the only way to know for sure. I was hoping that he wasn't starting to lie again,  so I needed to know. I went on his messenger and looked at his conversations with his ex. She hadn't contacted him, so I was happy. I wanted to see if she had contacted him at all in our relationship since he said she hadn't, so I scrolled up. It loaded and when I scrolled up a little more I saw something that caught my eye. It was a message from when they were together which said ""If we end up getting married and having a little girl, can we name her Addie Mae?""

&amp;#x200B;

I am so devastated, and really angry. He NEVER told me that his ex girlfriend came up with the name, and that was what they were planning on naming their child. I want to call him out on it, but then I would obviously have to admit how I found it. I know he won't be mad about me snooping as we have open access to each other's phones. I'm sure he forgot the message was there, but I KNOW he didn't forget who came up with that name. 

&amp;#x200B;

How should I bring this up to him? Should I bring it up? Is this as big of a deal as it feels like it is in my head? I was so instantly in love with the name and I've loved it for the last few years, so to suddenly change my mind would merit some questions from him about why. And frankly, I'm so hurt and mad I don't think I could have him question my motives much before I just let it all out. 

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR - Husband wants to name our child Addie Mae. I agreed, but didn't know that Addie Mae was the name his ex girlfriend had chosen for when they have a child. I am so upset. "
21,"UPDATE: I [24F] have been dating my BF [25M] for nearly five years. He is a Jehovah Witness and his family still does not know about me.


Well, it's been 5 years since I last posted and I have an update! I didn't get many responses, but saw a post on r/relationships today that resonated with me and felt like I should log in to update. 


Here's the link to my old post:
https://old.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/2tsoua/i_24f_have_been_dating_my_bf_25m_for_nearly_five/

I'm 29 now, and up until this past September, I was still with the same boyfriend. No, he still never introduced me to his parents and I never met his sisters, or his closest friends from church either. In fact, I only found out after we decided to break up that his parents knew about me at one point early on because someone caught us together in public, and he lied and said we had broken up.

It was an amiable break up, I had no anger or hostility on my end. Our friends had just gotten married in August and dated for a similar amount of time as us and I asked him if he could see that for us. He said he would like it to, but can't see it happening. A couple weeks went by and I decided I was tired of being a secret, and wanted to find someone who could be with me in public. All I wanted so desperately was to be able to hold someone's hand in public, and I was denied that for so long. He agreed and said he took up too much of my time, and encouraged me to start dating to find someone. We stayed as friends, up until December when I felt ready to try looking for someone again.

I met someone not too long after online, and we really hit it off. I'm still seeing him to this day and things are going really well. Honestly I can't believe my luck in finding him. We've discussed our history, what we want for our future and feel a sense of compatibility. It feels so good to finally not be a secret, I'm overjoyed.

As for my ex, we finally went no contact in January. I could tell it made new guy uncomfortable how frequent we still talked so I made the decision myself to minimize contact. Ex agreed, and wished me the best. A week later, he asked to speak with me and said he has really thought about it, and deeply apologized for keeping me a secret all this time, that he was willing to leave the church to want to be with me. I said no, because I found someone that wants to be with me and that we went on for too long. I still have no anger towards him, just a lot of sadness that we didn't work out and that it went on for as long as it did. I think I will always care for him, but it took me leaving and finding someone else to make him realize what he had all along. 

I posted this today because I saw a post about getting back together with an ex after 10 years together, and all the comments in the post resonated with me. He didn't really show any actions behind his words. I changed and I ended it. There was a reason I wanted to end it in the first place. And previously when I felt the weight of my history with him in comparison to my BF now, I know it's the feeling of going back to safe and comfort. It's not sustainable and it's not something where anything can grow. It took me another 4 years from my last post to learn this lesson. I'm just content it didn't take me another 4 more.

TLDR; we broke up. I never met his parents. I'm dating someone else now and really happy."
22,"My (31F) prank on my husband (33M) went South. How do we get past it?


Recently, I've been occasionally popping out of hiding and and scaring/startling my husband. We both find it hilarious.  Two days ago, I came home and realized he was in his office with the door open. I decided to take the opportunity to sneak in and scare him. I dropped to the ground in the hallway and slowly and silently army crawled into the room towards his chair. It was hard not to giggle. He was completely oblivious to my presence. I was going to grab his ankle with my bony little hand like the Crypt Keeper and scare the shit out of him. I get within distance and slowly reach my hand out to grab his ankle. Then I realize he's masturbating. I just totally froze and felt a mixture of horror and and panic. I decide to slowly back up and reverse crawl out of the room. Before I can move, he looks down. He looks down and sees his wife on the ground at his feet, not moving, with her hand outstretched to grab his ankle. We just fucking stared at each other.  

I'm an open book but my husband is very private about sexual matters and has seemed super embarrassed and uncomfortable since this happened.  He has been quiet and blushing like a maiden when I try to meet his eye.  We haven't talked about it.  Should I broach it and apologize?  If so, how should I go about it without embarrassing him further?  Or should we never speak of it?  

TL;DR   I (31F) failed spectacularly at pranking my husband (33M) and have caused him some embarrassment.  Should I try to talk with him about it (how?) or pretend it never happened?"
23,"My boyfriend made me pay for my birthday breakfast


Yesterday was my 22nd birthday. My boyfriend’s 22, about to be 23 in 7 days. I work at a restaurant full time and moved out when I was 19, and I’ve 100% supported myself for 3 years now. He’s a full time college student and has had jobs/internships on and off but doesn’t have a job at the moment. He did work two jobs for a year or two so he had a lot of money in savings but used all that money to pay for his school. He recently applied to a couple jobs since his savings have dwindled down to zero but because he still lives at home and his dad pays for everything, him getting a job isn’t urgent or necessary.

We’ve been together for a year and 8 months now. I didn’t have a car when we first started dating and still don’t but he did and still does (again, which his dad pays for). I’ve always given him money for gas for picking me up, dropping me off and going wherever we went. It was starting to add up and even in the beginning I told him it wasn’t going to work out because I needed to use that money to save up for getting a car instead of giving him gas money to hang out all the time. He told me not to worry about it, but being who I am I still gave him money for gas, especially knowing he had a limited amount in his savings.

We used to pay separate or for our own meals when going out, but after being together for so long now I don’t give him gas money as often and just pay for both of our food. However because he’s used all his savings on school and doesn’t have a job, he can’t pay for himself, so I have no choice but to pay for him. I didn’t mind it in the beginning, but I feel like he thinks we can just do whatever because I’m paying for it and he even said when he gets a job he’ll “get me back”. 

Well, yesterday was my birthday and I told him I didn’t want to do anything because I didn’t want to spend any money (and because I knew he didn’t have any). Well he gets off from school so texts me if I wanted to go get breakfast, so I asked where at and he asked again “At [this specific breakfast restaurant]?” So I say sure. So we go there, and we’re done eating and as we’re getting up he’s on his phone so I grab the check and we’re making our way towards the front where we pay, and he doesn’t even try to take it from me. So I pay for everything which is a little under $35 ($28 for food + $7 tip). He didn’t mention anything about it until later that night when we were driving in the car and he said that he “felt bad” about letting me pay for it. Which I don’t understand because it was his idea to go get breakfast, at that specific place. And having it be my birthday I thought he’d at least ask to borrow money from his dad instead of making me pay. He did say that, because his birthday’s only 7 days from mine, whatever money he got for his birthday he’d use it to pay me back for what I spent on my birthday.

But I’m still upset about it. I feel like I’m using my own personal money that I worked hard for and he’s just getting money from either his dad or birthday gift money that he didn’t have to put in any sweat for. I don’t know how to bring it up or what to do about it. Please help!!!

TLDR; My boyfriend made me pay for my birthday breakfast. What should I do?"

A few months back my boyfriend and I decided to go to a sex shop together. We both went there there together as a couple. I’m exploring my sexuality right now with my bf. I see no problem with this. My bf and I always always always make sure we use protection when having sex and are very careful when we do the deed. So it’s not like I’m not being safe or anything. I know the possible consequences to getting pregnant and have discussed this with my boyfriend. 

I live with my parents [54/f] [50s/m] right now but I’m saving to move out. My mom in the past has made it clear that she doesn’t want my bf and I “fooling around” in the house. I respect that it’s my parents house and their rules and I don’t do that there but it’s not like she’s completely in the dark to the fact that Im sexually active. We’ve had conversations about it before and she really doesn’t want me having sex until I’m married. My whole family is Christian and I am not. I think that’s important to add because our views on sexuality greatly differ. 

Fast forward to yesterday, my mom was looking through my stuff and discovered my stash of condoms/lube. That night when I got back from work she asked to talk to me. She told me she needed to have an uncomfortable conversation with me. She told me that she found the sex stuff and asked me where I had got it. I told her that I went to a sex shop with my bf and that we got it there. She was furious. 

Now this is where shit hits the fan. She asked me how I could take my boyfriend to such a place. She said I was poisoning his mind with perverse thoughts of other women by taking him there. I told her that we both made the decision to go into the store as a couple but she countered that by accusing me of manipulating him to fulfill my sexual desires. She said that she knows I watch porn, I do once in a while, she told me that I had no idea what I was getting myself into. She told me that I was a pervert and that pedophiles watch porn. She asked if I wanted to be a pedophile. She said a bunch of other fucked up things as she does when she gets angry like this. I don’t look at illegal or crazy shit and I’m not into that stuff. I think most people watch porn from time to time and I don’t see a problem with it. I didn’t argue with her though because how and I supposed to compose a rational argument when she’s basically in hysterics. 

That’s not the end of it though she told my family about my “sins” so now I’ve locked myself in my room out of sheer embarrassment. I know this makes my mom look really bad but she’s not a horrible person she’s done so much for me and I appreciate everything she’s done for me. Anyway I guess what I’m asking is how do I get out of this house asap? Am I overreacting? I just need advice right now. 

TL;DR
My mom freaked out over seeing some sex stuff I bought at a sex shop and said a bunch of fucked up things to me and now I want to leave. 
"
25,"My Mum (50's) has told me I (27F) need professional help and that she doesn't like me as a person after an almost 12 year long argument with my sister (25f) - what do I do next, I don't want to lose my family but feel like NC is my only choice.


 

Apologies for the length but it’s all important and won't make sense without all the info. TLDR at the end.    
   
Background:  

Let me just start my saying I don’t hate my sister - I just cannot have her in my life any longer and I think she is evil to the core. She has spent her life lying and manipulating the people around us (mostly my parents) to make me look like a bad person. 

When I lived at home we didn’t get on and I ended up running away after my step dad was violent to me (due to an argument with my sister where she whispered constantly in my ear how hated I am and how much she wished I’d leave home and how much family would be better off without me, and a threw a forkful of food at her because I didn’t want to hit her like she was provoking me to). I was only 16 at the time and had to leave home with bruises up both my arms and everything I could fit in two suitcases, with me begging my teachers not to call the police or social services because I was still in education, under 18 and covered in bruises.  

I’ve never lived at home since. I moved in with my then boyfriend’s family for a year before moving to a city 4 hours away to study when I was 18 and completely supported myself, I spent my summers travelling in the states and moved to Mexico when I was 21 before moving to Spain at 24.  

The Major Incidents:  

In this time, I’ve been home less than once a year, for less than a week at a time - I spend the majority of my time in London where I went to University, visiting my Godchildren at opposite ends of the country, and spend one night at my Mum’s and one night at my Dad’s. My sister has visited me twice - once in Mexico and once in Spain. Both times were a fucking disaster.    
   
In Mexico, she refused to speak to me or my boyfriend after the second day, turned up with no money at all and one morning I woke up and she was on skype with my parents telling them that we were doing drugs and bullying her (we smoked a bit of weed, I was 22 at the time and my boyfriend was 28 and we still never did it in front of her – she had her 21st birthday two weeks after she went home. My point is she isn’t a child, my parents don’t need to be called over it).    
   
A months later I flew to England to surprise my family, and after I had been there a day I realised they had locked me out of the part of the house where the bedrooms are - I asked why, but my mum refused to get involved but it was because of what “happened in Mexico”. I found out from my brother that I “stole” money from my sister when she came to visit – we had a family meeting, came out that she hadn’t brought any bloody money with her in the first place, and she just “suspected” I took money because her purse that was in the suitcase we were sharing (we took a mini break to the beach but she flew in and out of the city where I live) “had moved” when she was sleeping.    
   
I forgave her because she is my sister and I desperately (at that point) wanted a relationship with her as I am jealous of how close my step-siblings are with each other. When I moved to Spain, she was my first visitor – arriving weeks after I did when I was living in a hotel, hadn’t received my first paycheque and had spent my entire last paycheque on moving continents. She ate me out of house and home, had £25 to get from the airport to my house and had nothing else for the whole holiday when I was already supporting my perpetually jobless ex-boyfriend in a new country. She got paid the last night she was here, took us for dinner and nothing was ever said about her paying me back for a week of food, expensive sun creams, cigarettes and a couple of meals out.    
   
The next time I went to England I was in the kitchen with her but at opposite ends of the room and we were arguing about something trivial, when she started to scream at the top of her lungs “don’t hit me, don’t hit me” - my mum was in the other room. I stepped out into the other room and was like I am right here mum, I am not near her and she was like “she’s probably scared after you bit her in Mexico”. WTF? I didn’t bite her. Mum - “yes you did she told me last month”. I explained to my mum that my sister had visited Mexico around 2 years before and if I bit her, why did she come to Spain to visit me there – my mum had no answers and I walked out the house without resolving anything with either of them.  

I cut all contact with my sister, don’t see her when I am in the UK and we don’t have any contact online – apart from once, over a year ago whilst I was in England for a family funeral she pulled a very similar act to the one that made me leave home, where I was in the front seat with my legally deaf father and she was in the back in his “deaf” spot. She pulled a very similar “why are you here we don’t want you bla bla” and I called her a cunt. She threatened to call our mum (we were 26 and 24 at the time) and I smacked the phone out her hand, told her not to be childish and she started screaming. My dad pulled over the car and I told her if she didn’t shut up I’d hit her with a stiletto (classy and mature I know). And my Dad said he wished we got on and that was the end of the conversation.    
   
I have photos of us together from later on that night, selfies she has taken of us on my phone, posed photos from the wake and videos from the train we took together later that night – to me it was just an argument with a sibling but I came away from the meeting feeling positive about our relationship. I added her on Facebook and she changed her current profile photo to a picture of us together – although she didn’t accept my request. In August I contacted her on her birthday and wrote an emotional message online about how I was proud of her and loved her even if we didn’t have a relationship.    
   
In the end of last year she found out she was pregnant. She called me, told me she wanted me in the baby’s life. I told her I wanted to improve our relationship, she sent me scan pictures and baby bump pictures. She accepted my friend request on Facebook, I messaged her every other day, she called me twice both times for around an hour, I sent her links to baby stuff for sale in her area, got gifts for the baby and when my Dad spent Christmas Eve with her and Christmas Day with my step sister but forgot to even send me a message, I cried to her on the phone and she comforted me about how mean it was and called him a cunt for being so selfish.  

I booked flights back to the UK for January and arranged to meet with her when I got there, asked her to meet me for the day in a local city before going for dinner with one of our two sets of parents. In the end she could only get a Sunday off and I was meant to be in London for a meeting with a potential online employer – I rearranged the meeting and my whole week to be in my hometown for her only day off, to meet the baby daddy who I have never met and to spend the day with family.  

Two weeks later it was my birthday, she didn’t message or call me. I mentioned it to my mum a few days later that I was upset because I thought we were getting somewhere together... My mum blamed it on baby brain (she was 18 weeks pregnant at the time) and my sister sent me a message saying sorry and I responded explaining why I was so upset and she never replied.    
   
The current situation:    
   
A week after my birthday, I turned up at my mums (as arranged to meet my sister and spend time with extended family) walked in the house and said hi and she wouldn’t look at me. I’ve never met the baby daddy and he was there. Also didn’t look or speak to me. Went over to them and was like hi! In their faces. Both ignored me. Ignored me the whole night and just talked about the baby to the family. I’ve not seen them (my extended family) for over a year and I didn’t even get to tell them about my boyfriend who I have been with for a year but haven’t yet told them about because she just went on and on about her troubled pregnancy (she lives 15 miles from my parents and entire extended family and can see them at any time) until everyone left. When I left that night I gave her a hug but she still wouldn’t look or talk to me and I left in a foul mood to fly back to Spain, she made a huge scene of getting up off the sofa with her “baby bump” that just doesn’t exist because she was four months pregnant acting like eight.  

A week later my mum came to Spain and I asked her wtf the whole situation was about because my sister had been fine with me, calling me and we had arranged to meet just a couple of weeks before and my mum said it was my body language – because I am cold, how I hold yourself and that I generally unapproachable. I told her, body language or not, when someone comes into a room and says hello, you say hello back.  

And then she told me that my sister had told her she will never forgive me about the argument we had on the way back from the funeral over a year before and that’s why she doesn’t want me in her or her baby’s life. So, I called my sister who told me she couldn’t have the conversation because she was “heavily pregnant” and could “go into labour” at any time (she was 23/24 weeks pregnant and has preeclampsia) and she put the phone down. Within three minutes I was blocked from her and her partners profiles online (my only way of contact with her). My mum refused to discuss it further, we fell out pretty badly and my mum told me everything was fault, as well as that she would always love me as a person but she didn’t like me, my personality or my lifestyle choices.    
   
Since my mum left in January, every time she has messaged me I have asked her to ask my sister again why she pulled the stunt of arranging to meet me, then ignoring me and then not allowing me to speak to my family who she sees often. My mum has ignored all of these messages.    
   
On Monday I sent her another message saying: 

“1. Why did she tell me things were fine, why did I rearrange my meetings so I could see her on her day off, why was she calling me and sending me scan pictures if she had told you that she didn’t want a relationship with me? 

2. If she hates me so much and doesn’t want me in her life, why why why did she insist on being at your house on the only \*DAY\* I was at going to be there, when she didn’t want to see me and can see family every day since she lives 20 mins away unless it was to cause trouble. - if you hate someone and they are only in the country 7 days out of 365 and 6 of those 7 days they’re not even in the area - you wouldn’t travel to make sure you’re going to be there at the same time as the person you hate so much.”   
   
I received this back:    
   
“My honest opinion is that you need to get some help. Your treatment of me when you came to England was not acceptable. When I came to you it was even worse. I always believed it was (ex-boyfriends name) making you like you’d been but now he’s no longer in your life I realise this is you.   
   
I’m sorry but it needs to be said. Please please get some help. You have some really issues which are justified but you need help to learn how to deal with these and be able to move on. You mentioned untrue events to me when I came out and I realised you believed in your heart those things happened. But they didn’t. This is hard for me to say and maybe I should have been honest with you on my last trip. But I felt uncomfortable to say as I was with you on my own and I didn’t know how to help you or how you would react if I did.”    
   
The two events that I remember “wrongly” happened when I was 7 years old and 12 years old – she wasn’t present at one of them, but doesn’t believe my version of events because she doesn’t believe that it could have happened. The other was a very traumatic event that happened when I was 7 and I remember the duration as a lot longer than it actually was – but the event resulted in 10 years of therapy. I believe she wants me to seek help because she is addicted to multiple pills and when I had a breakdown at the end of my last relationship, I refused to take any prescribed medication and instead put myself in therapy again (not for the first time since ending ten years of weekly sessions).    
 

The “treatment” of her, was me not backing down on what had happened with my sister and not dropping the subject until it was discussed properly, and I walked out the house when she told me I made her want to kill herself because I wouldn’t drop the subject and she didn’t want to be around me – after the argument I offered to book her a flight home later that day and she said no, but the rest of the week was ruined over it.    
   
I suffer with anxiety and depression, but I am ok. I am in a relationship, have a new great job, live at the beach and spend my weekends doing what I love with my friends – and I know my mental health better than anyone and I am the first person to tell my friends/boyfriend and even employers if I don’t feel right because I never, ever want to go through a complete breakdown again and I am so used to therapy, its become second nature to seek it out when I don’t feel right, even if its just for a few weeks.    
   
What do I do now?    
   
I am so fucking broken by her message, I am torn between cutting her off completely and calling her to tell her why I am so angry with her. I was so excited to be an auntie (with step siblings included, there are 6 of us and she is the first to have one so it’s huge for us) but that’s not going to happen now and losing an already broken relationship with my sister was something I was prepared for anyway.... However, until this point my mum has been one of my best friends (even though it seems I haven’t been one of hers). She has not always treated me well, and has done a lot of things throughout my childhood that now I am an adult I understand were not ok and borderline abusive but I love her and my family so much. She is the first person I call when I am in trouble, scared, happy (she rarely calls me, and sometimes doesn’t answer, call me back or respond to my messages for days) – but I don’t know what I will do without her in my life.  

But I feel like she overstepped a mark. My own mum told me she didn’t like me, which is bad enough – and then (in fewer words) told me I was crazy and needed professional help, despite only seeing me a couple of weeks a year. My close friends, boyfriend, ex-roommates and my oldest friend who also knows my mum all agreed the message is completely out of order, completely uncalled for and that there is no way I need any “help” at this point in my life.    
   
I deleted my Facebook and muted her on all platforms, she hasn’t stopped messaging me since telling me not to shut her out and she is only trying to help me and she loves me so much, which is why she is pushing me to get the help I “so desperately need”. It’s hurting me so much, knowing she is hurting about me not responding – but I just cannot even bring myself to open the chats without being filled with rage and, to be honest, sadness.    
   
So where do I go from here? Do I cut her off forever, do I just send birthday and Christmas cards and when I have my own kids just never have them near their grandparents, aunties, uncles and cousins? My mum is one of 9 siblings and cutting her and my sister off means my extended family having to choose between her and me at the annual Christmas get together. Or do I pretend it didn’t happen and go on as normal? Looking for some advice...    
   
TLDR: My sister and I have a terrible relationship, we reconnected after she found out she was pregnant and she tricked me into meeting up with her after weeks of messaging back and forth and a couple of hour long phone calls, only to ignore me to my face when I arrived. I have since found out she ignored me because she doesn’t want a relationship with me and never will due to an incident that happened a year before we reconnected. I asked my mum to find out why and my mum told me she doesn’t like me as a person and told me I need professional help because I am not ok.

26,"My [17F] granny [79F] cries when she thinks there's no one around? Should I ask her why?


My family lives literally next door to our mom's mom. We see her everyday. Sometimes she comes to our home for breakfast. Most nights she doesn't sleep alone, she comes to us or my brother or me go to her home and stay the night. Most days we stay with her in the afternoons when we don't have other things to do from school, going out, etc.

She generally receives visits every week from family members. Shes super active, drives, uses smartphones and computers, and is very healthy. Grandad died about 7 years ago and she's been alone in the house since, but like I said she always has somebody around.

I have heard her cry at least 3 times, though, in the past months. She's partially deaf and uses that ear piece thing, but she often doesn't realize someone is around her, and sometimes even when she knows we are there, we can still talk to her from like, across the kitchen and she'll have a hard time listening to us, so I don't think she ever thought anyone was around her when I listened to her cry.

It's been at pretty random times, in her bedroom, like the middle of the afternoon or on a weekend morning where nothing in particular was happening. Every time I have stepped out and came back a few minutes later, or called from back home to make some small talk so she knows I'm coming.

Should I ask her why? She cries and sobs and kinda mumbles things. Should I ask her? Or would it make her feel bad for me to ask her?

**tl;dr:** Grandma cries seemingly randomly when she thinks there's no one at home. Should I ask her why or would that hurt her more?"
27,"My [30F] partner [30M] thinks I’m not showing enough excitement and I oddly feel like he wishes I was an anime character?


Hi everyone, I’m having some relationship issues so I’ve decided to post on a throwaway because I feel like I have no one to turn to.  Personality wise I’m a fairly low energy mellow person.  It’s hard for me to get overly excited about things because that’s just not me.  I was raised by a father who mostly kept to himself and I think that rubbed off on me because as an adult I’m a pretty quiet to myself kind of person.  My partner has an issue with how I express my gratefulness when he pays for dinner or buys us snacks.  I usually respond with, “thank you, baby for ___”.  He tells me that he wants me to say something along the lines of, “you’re the most amazing boyfriend in the world, what did I do to deserve you, I can’t wait to marry you”.  I wish I was exaggerating this.

I’ve explained several times that it’s really difficult for me to express myself to the standards he sets because it makes me feel like I’m being extremely fake.  Instead, I try to express it the best I can by being genuine and communicating that I appreciate him when he pays for dinner.  However it still stresses me out because it essentially makes me feel like he wants me to be someone I’m not.  He’s openly expressed himself as being a person who loves anime waifus that are over the top in terms of energy and I think it really rubs me the wrong way because in past fights he has reiterated, “why can’t you just do what I tell you do, if you did, I’d be happy” or “I would be so happy if you were like an anime maid”.  It seriously makes me feel like he wishes I was an inanimate object or fictional character.

To make matters worse, I found out recently that he lied about being sick to do drugs with a coworker.  That day he was messaging me about my day acting like he was in bed recovering, but in actuality they were hanging out in his room all night.  I took it as him being exhausted from work so I checked on him throughout the day then I found out he lied.  I confronted him about it asking why he lied and he replied with how I’m disrespectful and don’t appreciate the money he spends on me.  The thing is, I never ask him to buy me things and if anything I always tell him to save his money for a rainy day.

Right now I’m not sure what to do and I feel like I’m almost losing who I am as a core person.  Every time I try to talk things out he just gets angry and defensive.  All I ask from him is to be honest and respectful, but I just feel defeated after all of this.

TLDR:  boyfriend thinks I should act like an anime maid waifu character, got mad I asked why he lied about being sick and told me I’m disrespectful
"
28,"My girlfriend [30F] told me that I [29M] am selfish for not wanting a birthday gift or celebration.


My birthday is in a couple of weeks and I am dreading it. Normally I don't have any feelings towards my birthday, but since my gf and I have been together (4 years) I can't stop thinking about how much I am not looking forward to my birthday.

I don't like to receive gifts, I don't like to be the centre of attention ever. If I want something, I'll get it myself. However, I am polite when people do give me gifts and I'll say how much I love it and all that. Every year my girlfriend will ask me what I want for my birthday and I am truthful. ""Nothing."" Please, just give me nothing. The best birthday anyone could ever give me would be one where nobody acknowledged it at all; that would make me so happy. (I don't mind the text/phone call from family and friends for a quick greeting since we live far away)

Every year with my gf it's a fight. That I'm selfish because I won't tell her what I want for my birthday, because I won't take the day off from work to celebrate my birthday, etc. I've been at my current job for 8 years and still not a single person (other than HR probably) knows when my birthday is. For the last month or so, my girlfriend would ask me ""Are you excited for your birthday plans? Are you excited for your birthday present?"". I don't show any excitement at all, and she gets mad.

A few months ago, I actually found something that I wanted to do and it just so happened to land on my birthday. I told my girlfriend about this cool (for me) event that was happening and we fought about it for 2 days. She didn't tell me outright that I couldn't go, but it was obvious that she didn't want to. Her reasoning was that she wanted to plan something for my birthday. I asked her if she already planned something and the answer was ""No, but I want the option to and it's pretty selfish that you're taking that away from me"". 

So I didn't get tickets to the event. I now know that what my girlfriend has planned for my birthday: Staying home, watching a movie, and eating take out. I should be glad that she didn't plan a party or anything with other people, but watching Netflix and eating take out is something we could do on any day, why was it so special that it HAD to be on my birthday. 

I just don't understand why my girlfriend can't respect my wishes about please not doing anything for my birthday. All it does is stress me out and I feel like it can so easily be avoided. What do I do?

TL;DR: I don't like to celebrate my birthday. My girlfriend forces me to celebrate it every year and gets angry when I don't show enthusiasm."
29,"my[25m] girlfriend[25f] of 1 year got angry at me last night when we were going out to eat because I forgot my wallet at home. Is this normal?


so last night me and my girlfriend were going out to eat. Normally I pay when we go out so when I told her I forgot my wallet she got really pissed and told me I was going to have to pay her back. Not just for my meal, but HER meal also. This isn't the first time this sort of thing has happened. a couple months ago we were going to the movies and I asked if she could pay for her own ticket. She got super angry and said I should have told her she would have to pay for her ticket before we left. Honestly, this is not sitting well with me at all. Is this behavior normal? 

TL;DR my girlfriend got pissed at me because I left my wallet at home "
30,"My [25 F] friend [26 M] of six yrs saved my life a month ago. I feel indebted to him and don't know how to thank him or act, and it's affecting our friendship.


**Tldr: My friend of six years risked his own life to save me in a terrible car crash. I obviously am so appreciative, but I do feel indebted and beholden to him, which is making me withdraw to an extent. What should I say to him to make things normal again?**   


Okay, so this is a bit of a story to say the least...   


I've been friends with 'Liam' for a little over six years- before anyone asks, it's always been purely platonic. Our extended friendship group is equal parts guys and girls, and we all date and form serious relationships outside of the friendship circle.   


Anyway, roughly a month ago (my memory is a bit sketchy here due to panic in the moment, so bare with me) Liam and I were driving to a housewarming on the other side of the city, he was the driver. It was one of those days where it was extremely hot in the late morning/afternoon (like 35 degrees c) and then it just started storming rain. I didn't know this then, but apparently that makes the roads oily and less safe... I certainly know that now!  


We were on the freeway and a car up ahead swerved and sort of turned 180 so I was viewing its side, and then the car in front of us crashed into it, and we crashed into that car- this all happened really suddenly and it was just a scary blur to me. So, there was a pile up and one of the cars had caught fire. It was really, really smoky... like you couldn't see the sky. When I started to actually realise what was up and try to get out of the car, I realised that I could barely move my foot... and then I looked at it and it was like, *bent*. It's weird but, only when I looked at it did it start hurting. So at this point I was pretty much hyperventilating thinking I couldn't escape and I didn't even realise what Liam was doing or check on him, because I am way shittier than he is I suppose :(   


He opened my passenger door and yelled 'are you okay?' and was trying to pull my arm- we couldn't really hear each other because other people were yelling and screaming and a car alarm was going off. I tried to just stand on my one good foot and sorta hop through the wreckage, and so Liam noticed my foot and started carrying me in his arms. I am pretty short and thin, but Liam isn't what one would consider a *strong* guy, maybe medium strength but he doesn't work out or anything so I could feel him struggling and breathing heavy. He had to stop once or twice, just dropped to the floor with me in his arms still while shit's ablaze and only getting worse around us, but he never let me go. Eventually we made it over the freeway and to safety. Police, helicopters, firefighters and ambulances swarmed the scene (as it turns out, Liam's car did end up catching fire...). At the hospital, they found that my foot is broken. Liam was suffering from really bad smoke inhalation and had to stay in hospital for two nights- a doctor said it was probably exasperated because he was physically exerting himself so hard in carrying me/took longer to make it out of the smokey area- I felt and feel really, really guilty about that too.   


To the current issue (wow, sorry for the ramble, I think I did need to write it all out for the first time though to get my head straight). The following days after, when he came out of hospital we hugged and I thanked him over and over and he was all 'don't mention it'. As time's gone on though, I've been feeling really guilty, weird, anxious around him and like our friendship isn't 'even' anymore and I'll never be able to repay him for literally saving my life. I'm on crutches, and when he tries to help me with stuff I'm all 'no, no I can manage' which I know is stupid, but it's like I don't want to add to the debt. Plus, we had a bit of a gathering with our other close friends two nights ago and after Liam briefly explained the serious of events, this friend called 'Fiona' said to me 'oh my god, if I was you I would have told Liam to save himself and leave me behind'. That just crushed me... I probably should have.   


Has anyone been through anything similar? Will things return to normal? How can I repay or properly thank Liam? Am I an evil person for letting him rescue me?"

He is nice, genuine, calm, funny and very introverted. I am more on an emotional side, extroverted, and outgoing. He calms me up and I make him more emotional, so we compliment each other well.

The thing that has been bothering me a lot lately, he **almost** never spends money on me. We work together, I make twice more. So I can understand him spending less in general. **But** not like this.

I cook for **us**\- every day. He eats 70% of that, (I don't eat much in general) and *what he haven't finished- he takes home without asking me ( assuming it's his) and eats it there*.... Never once he suggested to buy groceries for those dinners that I cook (he goes to the grocery store with me, and lets me pay for all the groceries that he knows I am buying for both of us). This has been going on for a long time now. 3 months.

We go out once a week where he pays for us, but it is once in a week. He **once!** bought me chocolate and brought home, and later ate it by himself when I wasn't around. At work-same thing. He buys himself snacks- and eats it alone. He never shares any food with me, when I am the opposite, and always share snacks with him. When I once shared chocolates with my gf at work, he said- you should share it with me, not with her. Like he expects me to do it.

Three weeks ago- Valentines, he didn't buy me anything. Not even a card, nothing. But gladly accepted my gift - a shirt and a card. He was very happy about that gift, but never bought me anything still.( Went to buy headphones for himself on that same day, asked me to come to the store with him). Never suggested to buy me anything, at least because I bought him a nice present. Next day he was online shopping for books, I thought maybe it is for me? Nope. Those were for him. 

**Latest example-**

Last night, he stayed at my place, heated himself my leftover food. I was hungry and ordered myself pizza. He didn't offer to pay for it. When the delivery guy came - he asked me for money. Then gladly ate the pizza with me. That heated food that he hasnt finished last night he took today to work as his lunch, without asking me or offering me my food as lunch. *Like it is his food.*

I woke up very frustrated. Tomorrow's is a women's day and he told me he is going to spend it with his mom, organizing picnic for her, cooking food and stuff. Not a word about doing anything for me.

Now this guy may seem like he is using or is not into me. But he is very sweet, nice and polite. He is in no way ever rude to me or anyone. He is very loving  even though introverted as hell, and I now his feelings are real, he told me he want a serious relationship with me. 

But all of this is **extremely** upsetting.

do I tolerate this severe greediness towards me? It is very difficult to accept. I think about future. How do you start anything serious, when your bf can't or doesn't want to support even a little or buy anything.

I have a nice salary, I am better off than he is, and I assume he maybe thinks I don't need to be spoiled or paid for, but I need to pay for him? He said he wants to go on vacation with me. I don't. We once went on a trip together and I paid for a hotel and other activities, even freaking cinema tickets. It was 80-20 the whole trip.  I want to have a supportive bf, not rich, but the one I can depend on at least once in a while, who I can be a female with. At least 50-50 would be  super nice at this point. But not like what it is now. Its very sad.

I need to hear opinions.

32,"My [17f] dad gives me mixtapes as gifts but I generally don't like them. Should I just play along or tell him?


So my dad makes cassette mixtapes for me. I have a Walkman and get cassettes for the music I listen to, and he has since taken it upon himself to record mixtapes for the music he likes, which I largely don't like.

He's so sweet about it I'll feel like a total asshole if I tell him to stop, but like I said, he has totally different tastes and I don't really enjoy the things he listens to.

Should I just play along with it and just take them, or should I ask him to stop him because, I'll just listen once and put it away forever, which seems pointless? Would it be worst to pretend to like them?

What if he asks me about them and I'll have no opinion because I don't really like them or payed that much attention?

On the other hand, he always eagerly listens to the stuff I give him and likes it :/

Kinda makes me feel bad that I can't do the same.

**tl;dr:** Dad gives me mixtapes I find Boeing and don't enjoy. Should I keep taking them or tell him to stop and probably hurt him?"
33,"My [36 F] husband [38 M] of 14 years keeps changing jobs. For the last five years he has bounced from job to job, uprooting us each year, becoming more and more depressed and desperate with each new role.


when we got together years ago we both had low paying jobs and few prospects but with a lot of hard work he got his dream job, that turned into a nightmare. He has been diagnosed with major depressive disorder but wont seek help past his ineffective medication. I don't know how to help him anymore. We use to have a great relationship, but now our lives revolve around his illness and job hopping. 

He has this notion that he is suppose to provide and be like his overachieving father. I feel so scared and lost. I know that he is about to leave another job and he has only been there for 3 weeks. I need logical reasonable advice. Leaving him is not an option. 

a bit about me, I am career retail but not working at the moment because of the many moves and just not finding anything in our new city yet. Its not really a possibility for me to make much more then 20k a year. He doesn't really want me to work and prefers I stay home and do the housewife thing. I don't mind that at all because working retail was making me... well I worked retail for 20 years, so unhappy is not even the right word. 

I'm scared because of the insecurity, because I don't know if we are going to wind up homeless, because I don't contribute enough, because I think he puts pressure on himself because of me, mostly its because our relationship is terrible right now. There is no intimacy, he doesn't want me, he needs me like a life preserver. I still want him and its killing me. 

tl;dr my husbands depression and job hopping has ruined our relationship but I'm not ready to give up. "
34,"Me [33 F] with my husband [34 M] of 11 years, keeps joking about my mother being a whore and today did it in front of our son...


My husband thinks it's funny to joke that my mother is a whore and has done it for most of our marriage, despite me asking him not to.  He feels I am making too big a deal out of it because he ""jokingly mocks everyone.""  It wouldn't be such a big deal except that he hates my mom and so it seems less like joking when he calls her a whore.  

Today, he made a joke about her sleeping around with humans and dogs while our son [8 m] was in the car.  My husband stopped joking when I asked him to (he seemed offended and stopped talking entirely) but steadfastly refuses to agree to try not make those jokes around our child anymore.

I'm not sure what to do anymore.  I'm sick of these jokes but I don't know if I'm making too big a deal out of the whole thing?  I need unbiased advise, please.

TL;DR My husband calls my mom a whore, jokingly but it doesn't seem like a joke.  I've asked him to stop but he won't."
35,"My [23M] mother is threatening to send the police to my apartment for a wellness check if I don't respond to her texts.


Some backstory: 
Sunday was my birthday, and at the time I was going through a really bad ""breakup"". (I put breakup in quotes because we weren't officially dating because it was a LDR, but we had both confessed our feelings for each other and agreed not to see anyone else. We confessed to each other in early January, but we got into a huge fight that lasted about a week and things didn't work out.) I'm still feeling pretty bad about it and I don't want to talk to any of my family right now.

So, I should mention first that I live in AZ, and my family lives in MI. My mom texted me an obligatory happy birthday and I didn't respond to her text. Since then, my mom has been texting me and trying to call me and I've been ignoring her. Now I know she knows I'm okay because I've been a bit active on social media, and she spends literally all of her freetime there. But she doesn't respect personal boundaries and I know that even if I respond saying I'm okay she'll continue to harass me with texts and phone calls. Now she's telling me she'll call the police for a wellness check if I don't respond by the end of today. This is her way of trying to force me to tall to her. Honestly the police would be easier to deal with than her, but I'd rather not have to go through the trouble of having them show up at my door and have to explain everything to them. What's the best way to deal with all this?

tldr; I don't want to talk to my family, my mom doesn't want me to not talk to her, and now she's threatening to send the cops if I don't respond by the end of the day."
36,"My [27f] bf[29M] is mad at me for getting plastic surgery done before I met him and is asking for ""space""


When I was younger I got some work done to fix some things I didn’t like about myself, I had an overbite so I got jaw surgery to fix it mainly for medical reasons but it also changed my face a lot and made it more symmetrical overall making me more attractive, I also got a nose job, a lip lift and my upper eyelids done. Getting this work done have changed my life significantly and I’m glad I went for it. I started dating my boyfriend 2 years ago and things have gotten pretty serious as in we moved in together and are talking about marriage, last night I casually mentioned something about my nose job and his reaction was uncalled for, he asked me why I didn’t tell him before and I told him I just didn’t think it was a big deal, we argued for a bit and he went to sleep, now he’s acting weird and asked for “space” I think he’s being ridiculous and it’s starting to make me feel like he values my appearance over my personality. Do you think I’m in the wrong here or is he over reacting? And how should I approach this? 

TLDR: bf is acting like I betrayed him by getting plastic surgery way before I met him and I’m not sure how to deal with it"
37,"Me [26F] with my family [57M 56F 29M 23F], they're all on a family vacation without me


Background - I'm a professional student with limited schedule flexibility. My younger sister Anne is in a similar program at a different institution and a couple years behind me. My older brother Andrew works in engineering. We all live out of state from my parents. While my parents have been supportive of me, it's always been clear that I don't fit in quite as neatly as the others. My family is religious (Christian) and socially and fiscally conservative; I am, for lack of a better word - not. Even before I left the church, I have always been more independent and liked to forget my own path. We have had a strained relationship throughout my teen years and young adulthood, complicated by my parents' somewhat avoidant tactics and high-EE responses. In my family, we don't talk about things that might cause conflict - but when they eventually get brought up, it's a huge, blow-out, awful, disastrous fight, which is subsequently never talked about again. Since moving farther away, I've put effort into un-learning those communication styles (including counseling) and putting appropriate distance in my relationship with my family, which I think (thought?) had been overall improving. I talk to my parents on the phone at least weekly, and was home more often in the fall due to the illness and death of an extended family member. I'm not close with my brother, but I do talk with my sister on a somewhat regular basis, including providing daily support over the last week regarding an exam similar to one I had recently taken.

Which brings me to why I'm writing today  - I finished my clinical year a week and a half ago, and had a week off to celebrate before starting up again for the final year of my education. This is a big deal! It's an extremely challenging program and this was the hardest part of it. I worked my butt off, and I did exceedingly well. For a couple weeks before my break, my parents kept floating around the idea of coming to visit me, and told me they'd be down sometime that week. Then Monday came, then Tuesday... I called them and pressed for specific details, and finally on Wednesday they committed to coming down the following day, because my dad wanted to look at a used car someone was selling near my city anyway. They came, and we had a somewhat awkward but overall nice visit. I was a little bummed because they didn't congratulate me or say anything at all about finishing my third year (for reference: for many of my classmates this is a cake/balloons/flowers event), but I'm an adult and I wasn't about to make a fuss about it. During the visit, they vaguely mentioned plans to go away to the beach the following week. For the past several years since we've all been grown, they've taken an early spring trip to the Caribbean together just the two of them, so I figured that was the case and told them to enjoy!

Fast forward to this past weekend when they were leaving - I had sent a message to our family group text and received radio silence. I didn't think much of it. I even called my parents Sunday to make sure they got in safely, and we had a pleasant short chat. Then yesterday, I saw on Andrews's instagram story that he was also at the same resort. Anne's is of them at the beach. The whole happy family, without me. Her spring break is this week, so they planned it around her so they could all go. Instead of talking to me about it or trying to compromise, they lied to my face. 

Reddit, I'm sitting here in the very cold Northeast looking at pictures of my whole family sunbathing in the tropics, and I'm heartbroken. I'm done. I don't even know what to say, or how to act, or if I should just delete them all from my life and move forward with the people whom I've chosen to be my family. The biggest complicating factor (beside my emotions), is while I have federal loans for tuition, I'm covering some of my cost-of-living expenses with a loan from my family's business, at their insistence due to the extremely high interest rates of grad-plus loans. My mom texted me this morning trying to act normal, and I told her I'm extremely hurt and angry, and I'm not going to pretend this isn't happening. She hasn't responded. I don't know what to do or where to go from here. I'm not okay with sweeping this under the rug, but I don't know if financially or emotionally I can afford to cut ties. Should I just wait it out a year, finish school, and drop them? Am I being dramatic for even thinking about this? How do I even talk to them about this? Can someone give me a hug?

38,"(20F) My friends (20F) think I don’t love my boyfriend of two years (21M) because we don’t hang out all the time.


This may seem like a weird issue, but bare with me. Me and my boyfriend are both quite young, but our relationship is great and we have respect for each other. We live together in a house and we’ve been living together for almost a year without troubles. I don’t have a lot of friends, while he has a lot of friends. I’m an introvert, he’s an extrovert. To me it’s not weird that we do things separately. If he wants to hang out with friends and drink sometimes then I’m not going to deny him that, and I’m completely okay with being alone and I actually like being alone. He always asks if I want to come, but I rarely join him. 

This is not a problem for me, but it seems to be a problem for my friends. The friends I have that have partners usually hang out with their partners 24/7, and never go out without them and never meet friends without them. Because of this, they accuse me of not loving my boyfriend enough to want to be with him all the time. But we live together, and we see each other everyday, and sometimes you just need to be alone or away from your partner a while. I think it’s a healthy thing to have in a relationship.
My friends have now taken this to the next level and are even trying to make me think that my boyfriend is cheating on me when I’m not with him, but I trust him completely. I’m just so tired of having friends that have their partners on a leash and then say I don’t love my boyfriend because I don’t have him on a leash, but is this maybe because we’re so young? 

TL;DR: Friends are accusing me of not loving my boyfriend because I let him have free time without me"
39,"We (32M 27F) aready bought engagement ring. He's pulling back. Should I leave?


Hey Reddit,

I hope you can help shed some light as I've been pulling my hair. 

Bf and I been together 3 years. Lived together 2. We always talked about when to get engaged and etc and were on the same page for a while. Then towards the last year, he kept going back and forth (multiple times which was extremely hard on me) so I told him if he's unsure about us we should part ways because getting married and having kids is something I want and if that's not for him or he's not sure about me he should let me go instead of holding me down because of selfish reasons (he doesn't want to break up because hes afraid he will regret it). I tried to end it on multiple occasions but each time he begs not to and says he is ready blah blah blah and this just further confuses me.

In December, he said he's ready to get engaged. We pick out a ring together.

2 days ago. The ring was ready to get picked up. He then brought up how he's unsure about getting married again and etc. So we're back at this again. This time I said I'm just done going back and forth like this. He asked to please give him a few days to think and he'll give me an answer. During this time he asked saying what if I want other girls? 

Last night, around 3am I woke up to him next to me on his phone. It's odd because I thought we'd both fell asleep around midnight. I glanced over and saw a conversation (can't make out what it is but it's WhatsApp) so I asked what are you doing? He immediatelg closes the  convo and said he's thinking about us. I said I saw a WhatsApp conversation and he's like yeah I'm looking at an old conversation with a girl before I met you (3 years ago) to analyze what I want. 

I feel like this is complete BS. How can you compare a 3 year relationship to a conversation with some girl you barely hung out with. I broke up with him on the spot and he kept saying ""why?! I was just thinking and analyzing! Don't leave!""

I ignore him and said I made my decision. This morning before he went to work he went to hug me while I was still sleeping and said ""please don't go today, can you wait until I'm back from work to talk? Promise me you won't leave.""

I said just go to work and he said he'll call in sick if I don't promise and swear I won't leave while he's at work. 

Now I'm home trying to organize my stuff and finalize my thoughts. I guess Im just emotional and upset, all over the place. I need some unbiased level headed advice. Am I making the right decision? I don't even know what he's going to say tonight but I know he'll refuse to let me go and I just need to be strong enough to walk. Some reassurance would be greatly appreciated! 

Td;lr found bf reminiscing over some old conversation while we already picked out a ring. Should I leave 
"
40,"My (24F) boyfriend (36M) choked me last night and I think I’m done this time.


TLDR at bottom

I don’t really have any friends or anyone to talk to about this so I guess that’s why I’m posting it here, just to get it all out and process it.
My boyfriend and I have been in a relationship for a couple years. It’s had its rough patches. However, the last few months have been good with very few blow ups. It is probably because he finally got a job and we do not see each other as much.

Last night he got sent home early from work because took two Klonopin. I knew he sounded fucked up over the phone but I still went over to his place. His place was a wreck. He wouldn’t leave me alone so I told him I was going to bed because I have to get up early. He came in the room and started berating me for leaving him out there and started going on about things that were not even happening. I got up and got my coat and said I am going home because I need to get up early. He wouldn’t let me through the door. I tried to push my way through and that’s when he grabbed me and through me against the couch and his anger became evil. He started swearing at me and calling me names. This is when I got hysterical. I tried again to run away from him and get outside but he grabbed me again and choked me. This went on for about an hour. I went silent and wouldn’t respond to him because any time I said want to go home this would trigger his anger and he would grab my throat and push me against the couch and call me a crybaby. I got angry to at one point and hit him in the face with a book I was trying to take home. He made me sit on the floor while he called the phone company threatening to disconnect my phone line. I didn’t really care about that I stayed silent. Eventually I told him okay I’m not leaving I’m not calling the cops I just want to go bed. He finally let me go to bed and he lied with me and him touching me, being near me made me want to throw up. I have told him I don’t want to see him again or hear his voice. I haven’t picked up any of his calls. But like I said before, I don’t have anyone here so I am not sure if I have enough resolve not to go back to him.

TLDR I was abused my boyfriend last night but I don’t know if I want it to be over."
41,"My (20F) close friend (20M) knows that I'm gay and acts inappropriately towards me whenever we're drunk


I've had a reddit account for some time and never really used it, but this has been bothering me for quite awhile so  I thought I'd bring it here.  

I've been friends with this guy for approximately 3 and a half years at this point, but we only really got close whenever I transferred to the same school as him fall of last year. During the semester we hung out around 3-5 times a week (working out, etc)  and usually played games or got on discord with our other friends when we weren't together. I felt really comfortable around him and we both opened up to each other about problems that we didn't feel like we could share with others, such as depression, anxiety regarding school, and issues that I was having with one of my ex-girlfriends.

Things were great, but towards the middle of the semester he started behaving strangely and getting - for a lack of a better word - clingy. I thought that maybe he had a crush on the girl that I was pursuing at the time so I confided in some of our mutual friends about his behavior just to see what their thoughts were and if I should confront him about it. They explained that it was actually because he had developed feelings for me, which he had told them about a few weeks prior. They also said that he had made some comments about me changing in front of him which made me feel uncomfortable. Once I knew, however, I stopped changing my clothes in front of him and I stopped making any sort of jokingly flirtatious comments towards him - basically anything I could think of that could have been perceived the wrong way I stopped. I didn't want to confront him at this point because he had never done anything to make me worry about physical boundaries, I didn't want to embarrass him, and I didn't want to seem inconsiderate because I know that a lot of times people can't help their feelings, regardless of the other person's sexuality. 

Over winter break he admitted his feelings for me. He said he knew that I was gay and that he didn't really have a chance with me, but that there was also some little part of him that still held out hope. I confirmed that I loved him as a friend, but that it was never going to happen and he said that he was doing his best to get over it and that he felt like it had lifted a weight off of his chest. I took that at face value and offered him space with no repercussions to our friendship, but he didn't want us to stop hanging out so I left it at that. 

I thought that things would get better, but he began to get consistently more broody and now it's reached a point where whenever we hang out in group settings and he's at all intoxicated (I don't get drink when it's only the two of us because it makes me nervous) he behaves inappropriately towards me. He makes comments about my ass in my jeans, he calls me hot, he completely disregards my personal space and lays his hands on me, he goes out of his way to find me and sit as close to me as possible to the point where I have to fully lean over in order to maintain some semblance of separation, and he tries to rub my leg or shoulder. All of my friends have noticed it and they try and run interference whenever they can, which I think is ridiculous and shouldn't have to happen.

At this point I'm not really sure how to handle the situation. Should I confront him about it head on? Should I ask my friends to say something for me so that it isn't as uncomfortable? I'm conflicted because I don't want to completely change our group friendship dynamic and I don't want him to close himself off from everyone, but I also feel like he's disrespecting me as a person and taking advantage of the situation just because he's intoxicated. I would love some advice on what to do and the kinds of things that I could say if I confront him. 

TL;DR My friend developed feelings for me and is now making unwanted advances towards me whenever he thinks he can get away with it even though he knows I'm gay.

42,"My (29F) best friend (29F) of 14 years has feelings for my ""online boyfriend 30M)


Hey everyone, I would really appreciate some advice about a situation I'm in with my best friend. So I met a guy online (on reddit actually) 2 years ago and we have talked non-stop since then. Neither of us have dated anyone else in this time and I realized we were pretty much falling in love. I am aware this sounds totally crazy, I didn't even believe such a thing was possible. We talk like bf/gf and do normal things that people in a LDR would do. He's in Australia and I'm in the US so it wasn't so simple to just go meet each other. Eventually I was able to work it out where my best friend and I were able to travel to Australia and stay with him. She's the adventurous type so she joined this facebook group and found all kinds of things to do as a vacation for her so I could spend time with him.  It was everything I imagined and more, I'm even more crazy about him than I ever was before meeting him in person (again I do know it sounds weird, I would really prefer no comments about it please.) Obviously since she was staying at his home she interacted with him as well, but never without me there.

Shortly after I got home he started the process of obtaining a work visa in the US. Obviously I told my best friend because I'm very excited. She said we need to talk about what might happen once he gets here, I was confused by this. She said that there is a spark between them and she's heartbroken that she didn't meet him first. She stated that he is not my official boyfriend and I don't ""own him"" and things may be different once he arrives, and I need to understand that they have a connection and she doesn't want me to be hurt or disappointed if they end up having romantic feelings for each other. She also said I am seeing him through ""rose colored glasses"" and he wasn't much like I described, he's more her type than mine. She's friends with him on facebook but has never interacted with him beyond that. I was so taken aback. I said I don't think he feels like that about you to which she gave me kind of a pitying face, like she felt sorry for me for not realizing. Keep in mind she said all of this in a matter of fact tone, as if it were completely reasonable.

I do not think this is reasonable at all! I think she's completely out of line. Yes she's right that I don't own him but he is specifically coming halfway across the world to see me in a country he was never interested in visiting in the first place. I spoke with him about it and he said he has no idea what she's talking about and has no feelings for her whatsoever. I'm sorry this is so long. I'm at a loss how to handle this. I'm so upset by what she said and that she thinks she has a right to pursue a relationship with someone I've known for two years and I'm honestly uncomfortable around her now. 

I would like to know, does anyone have suggestions as to what to say to her? How am I supposed to interact with her from here? Am I being unfair? 

**TL;DR** I met a guy online and we've been talking for 2 years. I went to visit him and my friend came too. Now she is telling me she feels like they have a connection and when he comes to the US on a work visa I shouldn't be disappointed if something happens romantically between them. Does anyone have suggestions on how to handle this, should I talk to her? Does she really have a right to feel this way?

Thank you in advance to anyone who read this novel."
43,"Am I (27F) leading on my close friend (30M)?


Pretty basic stuff.

Some history:

I've known this man for nearly a decade maybe even more. When we first met, he was extremely immature. He would pinch me and insult me, and while I initially had a crush on him, his low self esteem and his behavior totally turned me off. I later (way later) learned he did this because he was attracted to me.

We drifted apart for a few years when he got himself another girl and I moved on.

He breaks up with her two years after we met, and things get pretty chill for us. At the time I was struggling mentally and academically and so was he. I decided to work on myself a bit, dropped out of school, and just worked. He slowly became my rock, telling me I should work towards finishing school and how he had my back. We pushed each other through these challenges and helped the other when needed. He's been there when I was at a really low point in my life, took me to therapy. I've been there when his mother died, and so on.

He's come far too: he went from not going to school, no motivation and now he he's a graduate from a top school, working a decent job that pays well.

The problem is that he recently (about a year ago) let me know he harbors deep, romantic feelings for me. 

My problem is that... I don't return these feelings. I don't dislike him, but I personally feel like I've known him too long to really see him romantically. 

It leads to this awkward argument, where he asked me to give him a good reason why I didn't see him this way and to be honest, I didn't have one really. If I think about it, it makes sense to be with him from a pragmatic view: I've been wanting a relationship, he's got a good job, he's been there for me and I enjoy my time with him... It seems like such a logical choice to be with him, really.

But I also believe I don't need to give him a reason. If I'm not feeling it, I'm not feeling it. This causes a bit of an issue between us. Our mutual friends have started seeing me as the bad guy, telling me I'm leading him on. Even though I told him point blank that I'm not interested in a relationship with him, they claim I'm leading him on by still being his friend.

I feel confused. Why can't I be friends with him?

Maybe I should just date him?

It's made me a bit depressed recently. He's also started touching my knee/thigh, and trying to hold my hand, and just generally getting closer physically. I usually end up just tucking my hand away when we hang out, or leaning away when he wants to get cuddly because it makes my stomach churn. I'm not an affectionate woman by default, even in previous relationships. 

Lately, it's become a weird cold war between us. I have asked him to stop trying to treat me like a girlfriend, because we're not a couple, and I'm not comfortable with the touches. He says he acknowledges this, but can't help himself. He also started to say he's my friend, but if I see anyone else, he'll end our friendship. This hurts to hear but adds to this thinking that maybe I SHOULD just date him, just to preserve the friendship, but then I tell myself that I don't want to be with someone who holds our relationship hostage.

He's asked for a date to start off, but lately I'm feeling resentment towards him. I don't think this is exactly a good way to start a relationship. I don't think I should date a man just because it makes sense on paper.

The only reason I've started considering dating him is because of this. I don't want to lose quite possibly the best friend I've ever had. People have started to tell me that I could have avoided this by giving him a chance sooner.

But I wasn't in a good place ""sooner.""

So, I need input on a few things: am I leading him off  by still being his friend when I'm not interested in him romantically? Is it normal to think you *should* just date someone because it's logical? Is there something wrong with me for not wanting to be in a relationship with him and not have a valid reason for rejecting him?

My thoughts right now are just to let this friendship die it's slow painful death. Thinking about how he's holding it hostage if I get with someone else is rubbing me all sorts of wrong.

The fact he doesn't respect my boundaries is another thing that's making me view him negatively.

I could talk to him again, and lay it out once more to try to save it: I don't want to date you, I'm not interested, you're my friend and I would appreciate not being touched like we're something more.

But is it worth it to say this again?

TL;DR: Close friend doesn't want to be friends anymore, keeps making advances towards me. Friends think I'm leading him on despite having told him point blank I'm not interested."
44,"My (26F) boyfriends (34M) mother (65F) won’t let go of this idea that we might be secretly related.


TL;DR - boyfriends mom thinks we’re half siblings. Theory doesn’t add up when I’m a different race and my father was a child when my boyfriend was conceived. 


We’ve been together 1.5 years and everything’s been great except this issue. This came about 3 months ago out of nowhere. 

My boyfriend does not know his father , his mother claims he was conceived during a one night stand back in her party days. My biological father walked out of my life when I was 2. 
She is stuck on this idea that we might be siblings. She has absolutely no reason to believe this. She’s always seemed like a nice normal lady but she will not drop this issue. There is absolutely no way my boyfriend and I have the same father. 

Here’s where her theory doesn’t add up. My boyfriend is white. She admits that she’s only slept with white men. My dad is black! That should be enough for her to let this go but it’s not. My dad was 17 years old when I was born. Meaning the only way that this would be possible Since my boyfriend is 8 years older than me is if she slept with a 9 year old child. That’s how old my father would’ve been the year my boyfriend was conceived. Not to mention our families are from different areas of the country. She is aware of all of this. I should add my boyfriend and I look nothing alike either. 

I have told her to drop this, my boyfriend has told her to drop this. She won’t, she tells everyone that will listen as if she’s just uncovered some great conspiracy theory. There’s so much wrong with this and she doesn’t seem to grasp that. Not only is it embarrassing but it’s also disgusting that the fact that my father would’ve been 9 years old isn’t enough for her to stop this. Honestly at first we thought she was joking but she’s serious. 

I’ve talked with her multiple times to see if maybe this is just a plan to break up our relationship. She says no, that she loves us together but the truth needs be out. I should add this isn’t a wacky idea she brings up now and then. It’s been nonstop for months, she tells everyone and has even posted about it on Facebook. My boyfriend and I are at a loss for how to handle this. Advice is appreciated."
45,"My[16M] mom[48F] passed away, she made everyone in the family promise her something but me.


When the doctor told us she had 2 weeks left at the best we all took turns as a family visiting her and spending time with her. Even though it was tough seeing her like that I knew those final moments ment everything to her and to me. The first time I visited she looked at me and screamed ""this sucks."" Two months later I still hear that ringing in my head; sometime it drives me and other times it holds me back. The day before she died everyone visited her one last time she asked everyone individually to promise her something. So everyone went up one at a time when she called them, telling her what they wanted to be or what they should do better but she never called on me. She even asked my girlfriend to promise her something but not me. The family dog died 2 weeks after she did and it's just been tough. The house feels so big and empty. I'm sorry this turned into kind of a rant thank you for letting me get stuff off my chest. 

TL;DR My mom passed away without making me promise her something I'd do in life like she did with the rest of my family."
46,"My [33/M] gf [41/F] is wealthy, stunning, and everyone says I’m lucky. But I think I’m being used.


  

Hello, loooooooooong time lurker of here and r/deadbedrooms, first time poster. I’ll try to catch you up. 

I don’t know what to do.

I am 33m, she is 41f, started dating 9 years ago. We are an opposites attract relationship and I’ve really enjoyed it. We’ve pushed each other to improve ourselves on a personal and professional level. She’s more extroverted and draws me out to the dance floor, I’m more introverted and got her to start reading books. We have the same dry sense of humor. We can be out at the bars or chilled on the couch together and be content with both. I melt whenever she looks at me. We, when things are right, work extremely well together.

She’s a former college cheerleader, award winning personality. The life of every party. I have told her she should run for office, she’s incredible. She works a six-figure job and her family is worth millions. Her beauty is stunning and people’s heads turn everywhere we go. Semi-regularly when we are out drinking or dancing, other men will come up to her and start sweet talking, trying to pull the robbery. I don’t mind, we get a chuckle out of it. I know she likes it when I hold my ground. Comes with the territory of dating someone with movie-star looks. 

I am 50 lbs overweight with big ears and a weak chin. I don’t make a lot of money and I am by no means a porn star. I however am pretty tall and somewhat charming and use that as much as I can to my benefit. 

I am, to use a football analogy, outkicking my coverage here.

I say that not for a pity party or a bad humblebrag, but rather to demonstrate the weird outside factors I feel like I’m constantly up against. My friends, family, coworkers, \*strangers\* who meet her have all told me repeatedly “Why aren’t you married? Why do you not have kids? What is the holdup? What’s wrong with you? What are you waiting for?” 

Well I bought an engagement ring in 2012. Haven’t proposed. She doesn’t want me to. It’s 2019.

She travels a lot for her career, on the road 10 days every month, and has only ever had long-distance relationships or casual dating with multiple partners. She’s never been married, never cohabitated, no kids (same for me). Her desire to have children is near nil, sidestepped with an “oh I don’t know” whenever it comes up. And that’s ok! I’m on the fence about kids too! I don’t pressure her at all. We both cringe whenever we’re asked at parties. We also don’t tell people how long we’ve been dating for the same reason. She refuses to answer and looks at me and I just sigh and say “years” to comedic effect. It’s just awkward.

But after 9 years of dating, I’ve learned I do want to be married. 

She is very sweet on the phone when she travels. Texts sweet pet names a lot. Checks in every morning and night from the hotel. When she gets home she is desultory, distant, and quick to go to sleep. I don’t think she’s cheating on me. We each have looked through each other’s phones in moments of insecurity, but no discoveries have been made. 

Our families have never met in 9 years. I want them to meet. I’ve spent holidays with hers and we get along great. She has spent time with mine and they adore her. Any suggestions of mine for them to meet and she quickly shuts down the conversation.

I moved in with her 4 years ago, we share in the bill paying, yet what was once sharing the chores has turned into me doing all the chores while she watches TV. Any pushback from me is met with an immediate silent treatment or an exasperated comment about how she’s always exhausted from travelling. When she is not watching TV she is constantly upset about the state of the house, which, my friends, is immaculate. But she always feels like she has to keep cleaning or putting stuff away. She is the neatest hoarder I’ve ever met. Attempts to de-clutter are met with procrastination. I have one-third of a closet space for my belongings. The rest of my wardrobe is in our storage unit.

She will not tell her family we live together, though her friends and my family are aware and don’t care. She says her parents are very conservative and wouldn’t approve but I don’t believe it. Her siblings are phenomenal, really enjoy spending time with them.

Whenever they’re in town to visit I have to shove my things into the closet, cover it up with sheets, and secretly stay in a hotel. 

I told her two years ago that she needed to tell them. Kept telling her because I felt insulted and pushed to the side. She promised last autumn she would by Christmas when she went to visit them (I had to work.) She did not tell them. I’ve now told her to not tell them since it’s clearly uncomfortable for her. She was visibly relieved. 

I’ve been asked three times by her family members where I live, and all three times I had to lie while she stared at me.

My address on my driver’s license is my mother’s an hour away. I pay rent but I do not feel like I belong.

Our sex life has completely collapsed. You’ve heard the story. What was once mind-blowing sex, kinky, open, free, passionate is now gone for her. I am high libido, hers matched mine but has disappeared. I still have the same fire but she finds it to be a chore. Every-other-day intimacy became once a week, once a fortnight, then just standard perfunctory sex once a week, once a fortnight, once a month, etc etc etc. We don’t make eye contact. She won’t kiss me more than a peck. She rides me to orgasm quickly then tries to make me finish. In the last three years, we’ve made intimate love twice; the rest is starfish sex. Foreplay is out of the question now. I do not remember the last time she wanted sex to last more than ten minutes. This used to be someone who would go for hours and did everything under the sun, moon, and stars. I still can. I’m at a loss. I look better than I did nine years ago, so it shouldn’t be me.

And yet, it feels like it.

She thinks it’s hormonal and it might be, says she’s not pining for anyone else, but she’s made no attempt to change behavior or see a specialist or try solo/couples counseling or anything. I am told I have to accept it or leave. “There’s the door” is a common phrase from her whenever I want to talk seriously.

I’ve asked her recently if she’s depressed. I don’t think she’s shown signs of it but maybe she’s battling something larger? We both had individual counseling earlier in our lives to great effect. She denies feeling depressed and was shocked I asked her.

We travel a lot for vacation (no kids!) and the passion has diminished each year. She once heard and hypothesized it’s because we live together, but we don’t even have sex anymore when we’re in the Caribbean. 

Oh, she’s also now a bitter drunk. Didn’t used to be that way, used to let her freak flag fly. She doesn’t show in in public but oh boy, when we get home she gets ugly. She says the cruelest things when she’s drunk, about how she’s not happy, that I’m probably cheating on her, she doesn’t want me physically. She’ll pretend to fall asleep if I try to be intimate. A rare time she wanted it once on a trip and I got whiskey-dick and she questioned my masculinity the rest of the week. She’s super critical of her own body at all times and I guess I accidentally played into her insecurity, that I couldn’t get it up because I didn’t want her. I hope that’s all it was.

I’m losing weight, I’m on a much better career path, my grooming habits years ago flipped from slovenly to neat-freak to match hers. I think I am at my peak self. She could not seem less interested, except when she’s lonely and texting me on the road. She wants to be treated like a princess but in return I feel like I am little more than a servant.

This year we’ve had sex twice, both shortly after NYE, and both times after we got into arguments after a night out on the town. The second time I told her that I was miserable about the distance between us and was going to leave. She dragged me upstairs and fucked me harder than any time in years. The next day she claims she didn’t remember any of it. 

EVERYTHING is telling me something is fatally wrong here. 

There are more red flags waving than at a North Korean parade.

Between the pressures of everyone telling me she’s the greatest thing to happen to me, and me once believing she’s the greatest thing to happen to me, and now the disappointment of the last couple years has left me in self-doubt. This to me isn’t an obvious case of relationship problem X or Y or Z. 

I love her smile, her personality, but she clearly is holding back and any attempts to discuss any of the things above are met with complete distain. So why date me for so long if she's unhappy?

And am I stuck in a sunken-cost fallacy, too afraid to pull out? Or ungrateful I’m getting 80% of what I want day-to-day, can’t I appreciate the good times and the financial security soon to come? 

Tl;dr I think my gf is a commitment-phobe and we’re growing apart and I don’t know if the flaws are worth papering over any longer."
47,"New [30sF] addition to sports team flirts incessantly with my [30sF] partner [30sM]. Partner apparently doesn't see it for what it is and doesn't understand why I don't like her when ""she tries so hard to be nice"" to me. Advice?


Throwaway because at least one of them reddits and because I'm embarrassed AF to be dealing with high school-level drama aged 30.

TL;DR: Recent acquaintance can't keep her eyes or hands off my partner when she sees him, even if I'm right there. Is cloyingly ""nice"" to me all the while, so partner doesn't understand why I dislike this girl. Advice on how best to handle this situation?

\-------------------------------------------------------

A few weeks ago this girl ""Brittany"" started showing up to essentially every iteration of a sport-related meetup my partner of one year \[late30sM\] and I \[early30sF\] participate in. Relevant: I attended two of the same meetups as Brittany while my partner was out of town, so I had the chance to observe the way she acts around people she's not trying to flirt with. Plot spoiler, not the same way she acts around my partner. 

Brittany has since met my partner, and has taken a very obvious (to me, at least) shine to him. A few examples: 

\- Finding reasons to put her hands on him in front of me when nothing about the situation requires or even invites the touching. For example, I was sitting down with him and every other friend we see greeted us verbally but she for some reason came up and grabbed his leg. She didn't do this to anyone else, male or female. She also likes to hug him goodbye and then hit him teasingly in the chest immediately afterwards so he will reach out to block being ""hit."" I haven't seen her do this to anyone else on any occasion. 

\- Crashing a double date my partner and I had after an event with another couple she's friends with, even after she found out it was one. The rest of us were still wearing dirty athletic attire, but Brittany changed into a sleeveless cutout dress with no bra despite the fact it was literally pouring outside. She then proceeded to sit directly across from us, stare at my partner, and play with her hair to the point that I thought it was going to fall off her head. No shit, she put it up (and then took it back down to twirl it) four separate times during the course of one dinner. She also made a point of mentioning that she and the partner my boyfriend might have seen her with at the other couple's wedding were no longer together.

\- A few weeks ago, at an event I couldn't attend, she apparently helped herself to some of my partner's gear. On my end this seems like a pretty obvious excuse to contact him on the pretext of ""giving it back."" They have been in contact about it, but she still has it. Surprise!

\- Last week before an event she needed a favor that I'd actually have been the one doing, but *strangely* she only messaged him about it. We didn't end up doing the favor, but my partner didn't understand why I found the request (and the channel for it) suspect.

\- That same event involved my partner and I, three men in their late 50s/early 60s, another (married) girl our age who was there by herself, and three women in their late 40s/early 50s. Brittany could see via Facebook exactly who was attending, and still turned up in lipstick and no bra. That probably doesn't sound so weird, but it might after I explain that at least half the group (not Brittany though, LOL) opted to wear coveralls because we expected to get that dirty during practice.

\- When we last saw Brittany a few days ago, she made a point to sit as close to us as she could get, even (awkwardly) ditching the people she was with and moving tables to do it. She then proceeded to lean across our table and stare at my partner every time he answered one of her questions. We sat with three other dudes and not a single one of them got the same reaction out of her. My partner had ordered a shareable appetizer and offered food to everyone sitting at the table. Long story short, Brittany is now literally the only person I have seen or heard moaning aloud while eating the food in question. If you only heard the audio, you'd guess either ""porn"" or ""Herbal Essences commercial.""

My partner apparently doesn't read any of Brittany's behavior as flirting and can't understand what I don't like about this girl. She makes a great show of asking me questions about my life (arguably they border on nosy, but taken alone they wouldn't be cause for any real reaction). In combination with the rest, though, her ""interest"" comes across as incredibly insincere.

My partner is smart, hot, nice to literally everyone, and talented at the sport we meet up to play, so I can't blame Brittany for being interested in him, but her clear lack of respect for our relationship puts friendship with her totally off the table for me. I have no interest in cultivating further connection with someone who is fake-nice to my face while hitting on my partner when I'm there (and almost certainly more so when I'm not). I don't even feel like *pretending* I like her, social graces be damned.

My partner and I are going to be seeing this girl indefinitely. He isn't interested in limiting his or our interactions with her because, as I said earlier, he doesn't see her behavior as flirting. If anything, he seems to be judging me for not wanting to be ""friends"" with her. His exact words were ""She tries so hard to be nice to you."" Um, sure she does.

So, I am really not sure how to handle this. Any advice is welcome!"
48,"My [29F] partner [32M] constantly pressures me to go to the gym.


TL;DR: My partner is driving me insane because he is constantly on at me to go to the gym. This has been going on for a couple of years.

He is an avid gym goer and very much into weightlifting. His focus is to build practical strength and generally improve his body so he can be healthier. This the is the same reasoning he gives to me when he is constantly pressuring me to go to the gym. I try to go 3 times a week but sometimes I don't for various reasons or no reason at all. I am not an inactive person and walk everywhere --we do not have car-- and I have no plans to quit going to the gym altogether like he often accuses me of. I am not overweight and he swears up and down this isn't about physical appearance. I do have some mental health problems (depression/anxiety but I either manage this myself or take up CBT when things become unmanageable). We recently moved countries and I frustratingly don't have a job yet but before we moved this was still going on and I had a job and walked there and back and got 15k steps a day. I'm just mentioning this to prove that I do try to keep moving. I walk and aim for 3x at gym but would personally be okay with 1-2 times. It's just not my favourite place but I know some weight work is good for joints and things.

Nearly every day he asks me if I have been to the gym or when I am next going. ""You missed the gym today? You've got to go, it's really important. You won't get stronger if you miss sessions. Have you been today? It's really important for your mental and physical health"". He often becomes angry at me if I did not go to the gym on my planned days. He becomes quiet and I can see in his face he is angry. This all stresses me out so much that sometimes I lie and say I have been but there are only so many times I can turn off my Find Friends so he can't see that I actually stayed home/didn't go. I feel my stomach turning even writing this because yesterday I ended up agreeing to go to the gym today and tomorrow because we are busy for the rest of this week and I haven't been yet. It's like him hounding me makes me NOT want to go to the gym but at the same time I think ""just go or you will have to deal with his disappointment and anger later"".

I've tried asking him to just chill out and stop hounding me so many times but it either ends in him a) getting angry at me and making me feel worthless or b) him apologising but then starting up his antics again a week later.

I can't cope with this. It seems innocuous but it's eating away at me and I honestly feel like I'm going crazy every time he talks to me about the gym. I have a stomach ache just from writing this post out. I feel like going to the gym to make him happy is the only way to get rid of it. How do I deal with this/him? How can I make him understand how crazy this makes my head feel?"
49,"I (28m) cut my friend (28f) out of my life and their husband (27m) started messaging me.


So back story, I have been friends with my friend who we'll refer to as J since high school. We were really close, used to hang all the time and whenever one of us moved the other moved shortly down the street without us telling each other we were moving or where. 

I recently moved back to the small town we live in and we started hanging out a lot. Now I live just down the road from J, who has been flaking out on me whenever we made plans. We make plans to go to an anime convention together and one of their friends decides they are taking a friend with them or pulling out of the room and taking all their money. I mention to J that I'm uncomfortable with this new person being invited 2 weeks before the ordeal. J threatens to pull out too if I don't let their friend come and if J pulls out then so does their husband and they would make one other person pull out. This would leave myself unable to afford going to the con and out of a lot of money. I have to cave in and say yes, the trip turned into me being emotionally held captive and unable to enjoy myself.

Flash forward to thanksgiving, we made plans to be together since neither of us have family we can enjoy the holidays with. We have had this planned for about a year. A week before Thanksgiving, J and their Husband take off because a friend invited them to stay a week at their home across country and said friend has money. J ends up texting me and asks me to watch their pets because they are leaving for a week and a half. Afterwards when they come back, they are unapologetic for blowing me off and then continue to talk about how this friend gave them hundreds of dollars of free stuff and all the fun they had. When I bring up the holiday plans we made, I'm an asshole who is being inconsiderate. 

Shortly after I get ghosted for a couple months and I notice that my life is actually nicer without them. J starts messaging me out of the blue and they start telling me they have gifts for me. I block J figuring it's probably for the best to not get sucked back into the way they have been treating me. J's husband then messages me asking what's my deal. Then starts telling me he can't be my friend because I'm not treating the person they love with respect. I say good bye and I tell him that I can't be friends because the way I'm constantly being treated. And I block him after I get rude confrontational messages telling me that I'm wrong and that his spouse is a great person. 

Hours pass and J starts messaging my roommate, saying that we all need to talk and work things out. My roommate shows me the repeated text that both J and their husband have been sending them all regarding myself and then pulling my roommate into it.

TLDR; I blocked an old friend because they were toxic and then their husband started rudely messaging me. Friend and husband then blow up my roommates phone."
50,"Crappy UPDATE to issues surrounding my boyfriend's deployment.


Previous post:
https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/9qhoa1/issues_surrounding_my_24f_so_24m_deploying_in_the/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share

I wish I could say this is a happy update but it's not. Starters I will say my boyfriend did not die during his deployment because that was my main source of anxiety.

One month into the deployment it turns out I needed surgery. I was able to make some friends within my boyfriend's unit so I had a LITTLE bit of support which meant rides to and from the hospital. I had complications and a 30 minute outpatient surgery ended up becoming 3 hours surgery and 3 days in the hospital. I made through recovery in a deep state of depression, and decided I would go back to my mom's for the last month of his deployment because honestly I was afraid to be alone with myself.

I ended up going back to my mom's two states away for the last 2 months of deployment, because my grandmother who was my 2nd parent growing up ended up in the ICU with encephalitis and a brain infection that she wasn't expected to make it through. 

During this time we talked and texted a little bit but not as much as I would have liked. I thought this was due to crappy internet but we'll get into it later.

Soon enough it's March 1st. I've been in CA for two months, my grandma recovered but then backslid into a coma for 3 weeks, waking up the day before I was scheduled to leave (I needed to get back to greet my boyfriend home but the main reason for the deadline was because I was out of medication that I need). I drove home with a carload of stuff that I left at my moms when moved the first time. It was a 3 day drive. 

I get home, my grandma is talking again and my boyfriend is coming home and I'm over the moon. 4 months of hell is coming to a close. I stock the fridge with all his favorites, unpack all the stuff I brought (this is important later), clean and finish up the laundry I didn't do before I left. I waited 6 hours on base for his plane because of delays. As soon as he stepped off the plane and I saw his face I got a horrible feeling. I chalked it up to anxiety, but when we went to embrace it just didn't feel right. It was a little peck kiss and he didn't even really want to hold my hand. Again, I chalked it up to him being tired. 

We get home and he showers, I make us some food and we basically have sex all day (as much as I can as I'm still really sick from issues that the surgery did not resolve) we pass out and when we wake up the next morning, he tells me that I need to move back to California. I asked him how long he knew. He said 2 months into his deployment. He said it was mainly financial issues, and he told me I'd be welcome back if I could get money into a savings account. I'm blown away. I didn't choose to have all these health problems that have made it impossible to work. He knew this when we got together. I told him I wouldn't be able to work for at least another year and he still told me to move in with him.

Now I have two carloads worth of shit and one car and a cat and a broken heart. He knew two months into the deployment and he admitted not telling me because he ""didn't think I would come back and he wanted to see me"". He barely texted or called me during his deployment on purpose. He used me for sex knowing he would leave me yesterday. I spent all day yesterday and today packing and anything that didn't fit we went to the post office and shipped to my house. The worst part is he let me come back here knowing full well my grandma might be dead by the time I get back, it's so touch and go. I leave tomorrow at 6 am.

I wanted to marry this man. The silver lining to this is I never have to come back to this hellhole of a town again and I can go back and be with my family for good. I know now that I'll never move this far away from them again. Regardless of that I'm absolutely devastated. I constantly feel like I'm going to throw up and I have another 20 hour drive back to CA. I know it's going to hit me harder when I get back home.

If I forgot to address anything from the original I can answer questions in the comments. Thanks for your support.

This sucks.

TL;DR I went through 4 months of absolute hell for him to blindside me with a breakup a day after his return"
51,"My (24F) best friend (21F) wants to end our friendship because I am no longer dating her emotionally abusive cheating brother and have moved on to someone new


I’m really at a loss for what to do here. 

Long story short, I became best friends with this girl, and eventually ended up dating her brother for about 2 years. He cheated several times, and just treated me horrible in general. He would scream at me any time I tried to calmly explain why I was upset about something, repeatedly manipulated/guilt tripped me into staying with him, and was just never a good boyfriend. 

After finding out he was inappropriately texting this girl, I had enough and I finally got the balls to leave him and block him on everything. I haven’t looked back since. I am so much better now emotionally and physically, and met the man of my dreams shortly after. He is truly an angel, and treats me so so well. 

Well, my best friend is not happy that I am no longer with her brother. I understand she wanted us to all be this big happy family, and how cool would that be for your best friend to marry your sibling? However that relationship was so beyond toxic and unhealthy and I needed to get out. I truly thought she would happy that I found someone who treats me like a queen, but she will not stop pestering me about her brother. She keeps telling me how weird it is that I’m with someone else, and she will send me screenshots of things he posts about me on Facebook. 

I made it clear to her that I did not wish to see or hear anything regarding her brother. I moved on from him, and I don’t wish to hear about someone who treated me so poorly for so long. I wanted to remain friends, but that was my one simple request: please don’t talk to me about your brother. She however can’t seem to respect this. Last night, when I reminded her of these boundaries she told me it wouldn’t be a problem anymore because she would no longer be talking to me. 

I feel like I’m crazy here. I set boundaries and she continues to blatantly disrespect them. I think I just lost a best friend. I’m so hurt and I’m not sure where to go from here. 

Tl;dr 

Dated my best friends brother for 2 years. It was a very toxic relationship, he cheated several times and just treated me terrible in general. I finally got fed up and moved on, found someone who treats me like a queen, but my best friend will not get over the fact that I’m not with her brother anymore. She continues to send me screenshots of things he says about me and will not respect the fact that I don’t want to hear about him. She said she essentially no longer wants to be friends because of this. Idk what to do"
52,"My friend [22M] got my [22F] nickname tattooed on him


Been friends for a year and a half. Very cool bloke. He reminds me of myself but slightly more outgoing. I have a nickname that's pretty unique. It's not taken from my real name. It's a name I use online but it caught on in my friend circle. They think it's a cool name and could work as a stage name or a band name. People often ask me what it means or where did it come from. Anyway, about a week or so ago I noticed some fresh ink on my pal. Tattooed on his arms was my nickname. The first half on his right arm and the second half on his left. I thought it was weird but at the time I told him it was cool.

I'm really bothered by it. Every time we hangout I can't help but stare at his arms and wonder ""why?"". It almost offends me, like he's trying to steal my name or something. But I know that's not the case. Should I just come out and ask why he got the tattoo? And how it makes me feel? If it matters, it isn't his first tattoo. He has one on his back that's amazing and original.

TL;DR: My friend has my nickname tattooed on his arms and I find it weird and almost offensive "
53,"my family's given up on the idea of me getting married


I (28F) haven't really been in a romantic relationship. Not because I don't want one, but because it just never happened. My grandmother and mother have made some comments/gestures about this that really hurt me, and I don't know whether I should say anything or just let it go. 

* My grandmother constantly asks me if I'm dating anyone.
* She tells me I should ""hurry up and get married.""
* Once she told me I needed to marry someone soon but that she wouldn't come to the wedding. 

There are extenuating circumstances-- my grandmother means well, but she's an old Jewish Bubie who's been married for over 50 years. My Zadie had two heart attacks and didn't like to travel because he thought that he would have another (even though both occurred at home), so that's why she said she wouldn't come to the wedding. Now he's dead and she still is reluctant to travel, so I doubt her response would be any different if I asked her, but I haven't asked because I'm still hurt about it even though I *know* she didn't mean anything by it. 

It makes me sad that my Zadie's dead and both my paternal grandparents are now dead and probably by the time I get married my Bubie will be dead too. I also know that I should enjoy this time I have with her, but I hate calling her because she always asks me if I'm dating anyone and I *never* am. She also likes to make comments about how she doesn't remember me coming to Zadie's funeral, but she was drugged out of her mind so. 

And now my mom. She understands that my (lack of) romantic life is a sensitive subject. It's tradition in my family that we give and get KitchenAid stand mixers for weddings. My sister and my cousin both got one as wedding gifts, and I've asked for one for my birthday to be told, ""When you get married."" It's a cute tradition, and I don't mind waiting, but my mom asked me if I wanted a stand mixer for my birthday this year. I'm torn, because, yeah, I bake a LOT and I would use it, and it's stupid to be upset about being given an expensive gift but. I feel like now my mom's given up on me getting married too. 

Should I say anything to them? Or just let it be? 

TL;DR: My grandmother makes comments about how I should hurry up and get married but she won't come to the wedding so I dislike calling her; my mom appears to have given up on the idea that I'll get married. Should I say anything to them?"
54,"Update: Me [25M] with her [20sF] deleted her bumble account after I got her number; date is still on


This got basically no traction, but I felt it was my duty to update as y'all helped me out.

[Original](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/axzexz/me_25m_with_her_20sf_deleted_her_bumble_account/)

So the day of the date came, she had asked me to send me my insta/fb handle (I have a common first name and she didn't know my last name) in order to be safe, I gave her my insta name and she never added me (as my account is private). Again this was something ""weird"" as when most people ask for that they just add them, that led me to think ""she doesn't want me to see her insta""

Conversation died off on the day of the date, nothing more than a ""See you at XXX"", I was travelling to an area I hadn't been to for a couple years, things were a little off.

I was on my way there and I had this massive pit in my stomach something felt wrong, I thought about turning around and cancelling but decided what is the worst thing that could happen....

And basically the exact opposite happened, I had built up this entire ""felt off"" thing in my head and everything was completely normal. We talked for 5 hours at the bar (and even switched to water and kept talking) even had inside jokes by the end. It was honestly the best online date I have ever been on (and I'm unfortunately a veteran of it).

For the curious, I felt comfortable asking her enough why she deleted it near the end, she said something along the lines of ""I wasn't talking to any guys on there and the app way being annoying"" basically exactly what a commented said.

I guess the moral of the story is, sometimes your gut is an asshole, is completely wrong and you should just live a little

TL;DR luckily didn't listen to my gut/brain and decided to go on the date, turned out to be amazing"
55,"I (29F) got into another huge fight with my husband (30M) over my spending


Last night I got into a huge fight with my husband after I told him I rented a handbag from a luxury rental store and he told me that what I did was stupid.

&amp;#x200B;

Some background info - I met my husband in grad school, and we have been together for six years, married for less than a year. After graduation, we are currently working in the same field, but the company I work for has much longer, unpredictable hours and a significantly more stressful workload than his company (he works a steady 9-5, while I regularly spend 10-12 hours in the office and often work through holidays and weekends). My annual salary is $200k+ (not intending this to be a flex/humblebrag post, but wanted to give context to our finances), and he makes less than I do, but not by a significant amount. My husband was fortunate to graduate debt free, while I graduated with $250k in student loans. For the past 2.5 years since I graduated, I have been feverishly paying off my student loans on my own, and my loans are currently down to around $100k. I plan to keep paying them down aggressively and hopefully be debt free in less than two years. I have never expected my husband to contribute toward my loans because 1) I had independently made the decision to attend grad school and take out these loans before we ever met and 2) I would rather he save the money he earns and invest it smartly. In other words, I assume full responsibility for my debt. When we married, we opened a joint account for expenses like rent but kept our own separate bank accounts. Aside from rent, we still generally pay for our own stuff (e.g., car insurance, doctor visits, etc.), which I have no issue with.

&amp;#x200B;

While it's definitely rewarding to have made significant progress in paying down my loans, I'm not going to lie - it's also been emotionally taxing. Working a pretty stressful job only to see more than 60% of my paycheck go toward loans each month has not always been ""fun."" While I can always be more frugal in my lifestyle, I believe I have been overall financially responsible. In addition to paying a significant amount per month toward my loans (I have not missed a single month since I started working), I max out my retirement accounts and try to keep my fixed costs low. After we graduated but before we got married and moved in together, I opted to rent a cheap room in a house instead of springing for an apartment. I drive an inexpensive car. I have rarely bought new clothing for the past 2 years.

&amp;#x200B;

Having made progress on my loans and getting a salary increase and bonus this past year, recently I have wanted to treat/reward myself. I made a few purchases recently, such as getting a Dyson hairdryer as a birthday gift to myself and getting some expensive shoes for our recent wedding. I also bought some nice things for our new apartment, like a bluetooth speaker (that I bought with a gift card) and a nice vacuum. I've also recently wanted to save for a nice handbag and decided to ""try"" one out first by renting one for a month from a rental website. All these purchases were made with my own money, including the items for our apartment. I don't intend to buy designer goods all the time, but admittedly it feels good to finally just buy some nice things because I like it and can afford to. It sounds shallow and superficial, but psychologically making these purchases keep me more sane at my stressful job because I can tangibly reward myself for hard work.

&amp;#x200B;

Unfortunately, everytime I have made these purchases, I have gotten into a huge argument with my husband. He thinks that I have become more and more materialistic and is afraid I'm going down a spending spree/financially irresponsible path. Meanwhile, I believe that I am entitled to make these purchases without his judgment because I bought them with my own money and have the means to (I'm still paying my loans aggressively, carry no credit card debt and still save money each month). While I have never thought my husband as cheap (e.g., we eat out, occasionally attend entertainment events, etc.), he is very frugal when it comes to spending on himself, so he just doesn't understand the appeal of something like wanting a nice handbag. When my husband told me that renting that handbag was a stupid decision, I became very, very upset. I felt like he wasn't taking into consideration all the other financial choices I made in my life and also (irrationally?) felt like he doesn't think I deserve to be rewarded for my hard work, as childish as that sounds.

&amp;#x200B;

Am I indeed being too materialistic and frivolous with my spending? Am I a selfish spouse for making these purchases? Going forward, do I have to consult with my husband before each big purchase? Or do I just do my own thing and not talk about it with him anymore (which seems secretive/dishonest)? I'm tired of fighting about this and don't want this to become a major issue for an otherwise wonderful marriage. I realize we are in a fortunate position and this may all be champagne problems, but these fights have been making me so unhappy and stressed.

&amp;#x200B;

**TL;DR** My husband thinks I'm becoming too materialistic and financially irresponsible after I made some purchases that I believe I can afford."
56,"My friends and I (22f) were planning a girl's trip to a beach resort. One girl (24f) wants to bring her boyfriend (24m), and I don't want to go if he's going



My friends from college and I were going to do a girls trip to a tropical beach resort. 5 girls... Me, three of my close friends, and this girl Ellen who I'm not too close with but my friends know. We always talked about it in terms of a ""girls week on the beach"" 

So I was super excited to go on the trip.. but then I heard that Ellen was bringing her new boyfriend. And I was kinda put off by that, we were gonna just have a girls trip and that would change the dynamic. Then I asked if the boy was someone I knew, and it turned out that he's this dude Mick who I knew in college and he was as asshole. Drinking a lot and being an obnoxious ass when drunk. Said some homophobic stuff which was really off putting to me because i am bisexual. I told my other friends that I wasn't a fan of Mick, and they all told me that he's changed since college, he's not been drinking much and he's been a good boyfriend to Ellen.

I've told them I'd think about stuff, and honestly the more I think about it the less interested I am on going on this trip. I don't think I'd have a good time with Mick there. The trip we have planned involves a lot if partying and I know Mick's been a total asshole when he's been drinking in the past.

So I don't know if I wanna tell the group that I'm just gonna bow out of the trip for personal reasons (so I don't stir the pot) or if I should say I'm not interested in going on the trip if Mick is going because how he's acted towards me in college, and it's up to them all if he's going or I am. (Which is how I really feel) We're supposed to be buying flight tickets and booking the resort this weekend so I need to figure this out quick.

tldr; My friends and I were planning a girl's beach trip. One girl I'm not super close with wants to bring her boyfriend who I think is an asshole. I don't wanna go on the trip if he'll be going and I don't know if i should quietly bow out, or tell my friends the truth.

57,"Next week I (49f) am leaving my bf (44m) of five years and I’m terrified


I’m leaving my bf next week while he is away on a trip and he has no idea. 

When we met 5 years ago my daughter had just been in a near fatal car accident. Her and my grandson lived with me at the time of the accident. She wasn’t expected to survive but she did and spent 6 months in the hospital plus another 3 months inpatient physical therapy. Tending to her and working a full time highly demanding job required that my grandson go stay with family out of state while she recovered.  After 3 months of juggling everything I was, for the first time in my life, fired for “taking too many vacation days”.

Meeting my bf during this time seemed great. He was compassionate, empathetic, supportive.....and in hindsight I realize that, after losing everything, I was desperate for normality and stability. I moved in with him 6 months later. He rather quickly became verbally and emotionally abusive. He is a narcissist and not only never admits any wrongdoing, but goes into a rage if even gently asked to address something. The fights will last for days on end with him yelling, throwing things, gaslighting, and saying the most hurtful things he can think of. Yes, I argue too, but then I spend days on end crying, apologizing, begging him to stop. To this day he has apologized to me exactly one time. But I was desperate for the relationship to work.

He travels for work and in our first year living together we both would use his iPad at times. I used it when he was gone to google something and there was an escort site open in the browser. I looked at his browser history and saw that every city he had recently spend the night in he searched for escorts specifically in that city. I confronted him and his reasons to explain it are too many to list here. Basically it boils down to “I don’t actually call them I just enjoy the pictures and bios”.  Yes, in case you’re wondering, I am a certified moron.

Fast forward five years. A lot of this same bs continued and increased.  For many reason I decided to break down and check his phone 6 weeks ago. There were multiple text threads of him buying escorts and having them in his hotel room. The most recent was 3 days before I checked his phone. I couldn’t tell him I knew because the entire thing would have then become about how I betrayed his trust by checking his phone. So I started a conversation about him acting differently the last few days. It was a four day fight. But the breakthrough for me was that since I absolutely knew the truth I could clearly see his gaslighting and manipulative behavior and it woke me tf up. I never told him I had the receipts.

Then last weekend he got mad literally because I asked him a question in the wrong tone of voice. It escalated and led to him (6’4” 300lbs) grabbing me by the shoulders/upper arms and shaking me like a rag doll. He then shoved me into a 5x6 empty room and confined me there by locking the door. He would periodically come back to ask me through the door if I was ready to respect him yet. 

So, I’m leaving and I’m terrified. He’s going on a trip this Sun-Thur and I’m going to leave once he is gone. I don’t know how I’m going to do this. I have a friend 800 miles away that is going to let me sleep on her couch. I have no car and $300 to my name. I think I’m going to try to rent a car, it seems to be cheaper than plane or bus...but I don’t know. 

I’m scared there are obvious things I should be doing that I’m not thinking of. I’ve created a text “safe word” with my friend so I can let her know if I need the police.  I just need to feel safe and I’m scared that since my judgement is so clearly screwed up I’m going to miss something important.  Any advice would by sincerely appreciated. 

tl;dr my bf of 5 years has cheated and become physically abusive. I’m leaving but I have no idea how."
58,"Future roommate [??F] already doesn't like me [18F], how do I live peacefully with her?


Hi! 

Basic context:

* I'm entering second year university next year and won't be living in residence
* My guarantor has already paid the first month's rent for a 2 bedroom apartment
* The people living there right now are sisters; let's call future roommate ""Sarah""

My landlord emailed me and Sarah 3 days ago and basically told us that we're roommates and we should get to know each other. I reached out via email asking Sarah for any contact information, and after a day, she emailed me back asking for my number, which I promptly gave. I received a text two hours later from Sarah saying,

&amp;#x200B;

""Thanks for giving your number. There is a problem. I am currently living in this apartment with my sister. She accidentally didn’t cancel her termination. She has to stay at \[apartment name\] for another year. I was wondering if you don’t mind moving into another type of suite. The suites are very similar and rooms are completely sound proof. Some rooms can have a private bath of their own at a lower price.""

&amp;#x200B;

I was confused, because how does one accidentally... not cancel their termination? I wouldn't mind switching to another 2-bedroom apartment (just not a 4/5 bedroom one because of my anxiety), though, so I called my guarantor about the situation, who called the landlord this morning, and basically what they discussed resulted in:

* the sister didn't ""forget"" or ""accidentally not cancel"", she changed her mind
* since i was already charged and there are no other 2-bedroom apartments available, I can't switch out

I relayed this information to Sarah in a text and wished her luck with sorting out the situation, but she responded with,

&amp;#x200B;

""I usually have friends and family over and they can be loud sometimes. My family sometimes stays over for a few days. If this bothers you, it’ll be difficult to be roommates.""

&amp;#x200B;

I updated my guarantor, who told me to leave it and that the landlord assured them it wouldn't be any of my responsibility to sort out Sarah and her sister's situation, but from these brief interactions alone, it's *quite* clear that Sarah wants nothing to do with me. I also get the sense that she's trying to scare/threaten me away from moving in, though I might be reading too much into things. 

&amp;#x200B;

I didn't reply to the text (as I'm still waiting for a response from my guarantor, who's on the phone with the landlord as I type this), and to be honest, I'm not sure how I can, either. 

&amp;#x200B;

I guess my question is, how can I go about living with Sarah for the foreseeable future if she already doesn't want me around? We haven't met in person yet and already I get the gut-feeling that she's going to make living together an unpleasant experience. I also feel like I'm missing part of the story? Eg, why would this *just now* become an issue when it's been more than a month since I was confirmed the room? Even tips on how to improve the situation would be greatly appreciated.

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR: future roommate's sister didn't cancel her termination on the room I'm moving into, so future roommate is being difficult. How do I live with her for the foreseeable future, or at least improve the situation?

&amp;#x200B;

Thank you so much in advance!!"
59,"My niece [15 F] just moved in with me [36 M]. I'm not good with people, nevermind kids. What should I be doing?


Okay, so I just unloaded on a guy on legaladvice about how unprepared I am for taking in a teenager girl, so I thought I might ask for some help elsewhere.

I am absolutely clueless about what I'm doing. Long story short, my niece ran away, I was able to find her last night. She refused to go home and asked to live with me. I didn't want to say yes, I don't exactly have room for her and I don't like kids, but I could tell she was scared to go back home and she's probably better off without her nutjob mother around, so I gave in. Mother agree with absolutely no fight. Actually thought it was a good idea. The selfish asshole wanted her out so there'd be more room for her and her new boyfriend.

I'm going to stop talking about my sister before I write something that gets me banned.

I live in a tiny studio apartment so I'm looking for a bigger place. I can afford a bigger place so that's no worry, just got to find the place first. My real question is, what do I do with a teenage girl? I'm clueless here.

The only kid I really know is the teenage son of a friend of mine. His father left when he was young too, so somehow over the past couple years I started filling that role in his life. It's easy though because at the end of the day he's his mother's problem, not mine. If he's annoying me I can just tell his mom to take him home. Plus, he usually behaves around me, but him and his mother can really get into it. She tells me all the stories about all the ways he drives her crazy.

With my niece, there will be no one to send her away to when she gets on my nerves (and everyone gets on my nerves). Plus based on some behavior I've seen I suspect past abuse, maybe not from her mother, but my sister is just stupid enough to turn a blind eye to her boyfriend (another reason I'm pissed at my sister and don't want my niece returning home). I'm not a violent person, I don't go around punching things or people, but I'm a yeller. What if she does something wrong and I yell at her and cause a PTSD attack or something?

And then there's the whole aspect of she's a teenage girl? I can't guide a teenage girl into adulthood? What do I do if she gets her, you know, that monthly thing. Or if she needs an undergarment for her chest.

I can't even type these goddamn words, how am I supposed to deal with these issues?

And goddamnit, I don't even want to think about her and boys.

Okay, it actually felt a little good to get all my worries just out there. Now, what the Hell do I do?

TL;DR My possibly abused niece ran away and is now living with me. Her mother okayed it. How am I supposed to raise a teenage girl?"
60,"Fiance(female 29) she wanted me(male 29) to cut her hair


And I fucked it up.

Basically she (29 years old jusg like me) has asked me a few times to do it and all the times I have refused because I was not confident in doing at all.

This time round I finally caved in and agreed, but I told her ""I'm going to do the best I can, I don't know enough about but I'll give it my best shot"", she replies with exactly how much to cut and how to use my fingers and a bit of the previous cut to perform the next cut.

First few cuts go well. Then it goes bad one snip was longer than the rest. Then I started panicking and I need to finish it off. Due to my fear I end up cutting the rest longer than the first few cuts.

She is now pissed but insists she is upset at herself for not realising how difficult it could be.... Because her father used to cut her hair as a child.

Now she's upset ofcourse and I feel that she is ofcourse upset at me... I mean I couldn't follow a simple instruction ffs.

Thing is.... She is pretty sensitive about her hair as she has heredetery famle hair loss and it has thinned alot in the last few years. This makes the whole situation worse and I don't know what I can do to help her at all.

TL;DR Fiance wanted me to cut her hair, I screwed up and I don't know how to fix it."
61,"My boyfriend unfriended me on Facebook and blew up on me when I asked about it.. am I wrong to be concerned?


We have been together two years and live together.  We also have a one year old daughter together. I’m [23F] kind of confused here because I noticed my [33M] unfriended me on Facebook. I confronted him about it in a nonaccusatory tone and he said that maybe “by accident” he unfriended me but it was because we had an argument.  He said he didn’t but then again he’s saying he did... I feel like he’s manipulating me? He started getting loud saying that he’s mad because I ruined his day by asking him this. He then came home and started getting loud again saying he will kill himself to prove that he’s not lying to me. I feel like that’s a pretty weird thing to say or do just because I asked him a question? He then started saying a bunch of other things like he pays the bills why am I always trying to argue etc but he doesn’t see it a problem to constantly accuse me of wanting to cheat on him? I feel a lot of anxiety when I’m with him I don’t know why.. I feel kind of scared with him like my feelings aren’t safe. He blows up when I confront him about anything or tell him what’s on my mind.  During the argument I told him to please leave me alone I feel like I’m having an anxiety attack and he didn’t seem to care.. he just went on about how I’m always looking to argue and that he doesn’t know what’s “wrong” with me. He always makes me feel like there’s something wrong with me.. my feelings don’t seem to matter. He turns everything  around to make me the bad guy. I’m often left feeling confused and crazy..  he doesn’t care about my anxiety and never tries to understand me. I find that I’m often doubting myself. I’m crying as I’m typing this and not once did he try to hold me or show empathy. 

TL;DR My boyfriend got really upset after asking him about Facebook. Was I really wrong to ask? Is he trying to manipulate me?"
62,"My [23f] alcoholic boyfriend has finally agreed to go to rehab and get help [32m] I don’t know if I want him to come home after.


Throwaway for obvious reasons. I have been with a man, “M” for 6 months now. We’ve known each other for right around 2 years as friends. M is everything I have ever wanted in a partner. He adores me. Cares for me when I’m sick. Genuinely loves me, which I’ve never had. I went from a 6 year relationship that was both emotionally and physically abusive, to one where I actually feel loved for the first time in my life. I don’t know if I could ever find anyone that loves me the way he does. 

M is an alcoholic. For the 6 months we’ve been together, he has had trouble holding down a job. I’ve been supporting him financially, and I’m running out of money. I have been begging him to get professional help and he would not agree to it. He got a DWI at the start of the year (2nd offense, first was 10 years ago.)

Yesterday, for the first time in our relationship, he admitted to me he was ready to go to rehab. He has been doing pretty well for 38 days, and says that he will do whatever it takes to keep me and to get better. He will be checking into a rehab facility this week. 

The problem is, I don’t know if he will change. I don’t know if he will go to rehab, and come home, and I will be stuck supporting him again. I don’t know if he will get better, then go to court and lose his license and the ability to even commute to a job. I love him to death, but I don’t know if he is even capable of holding a job at this point. Is it wrong of me to not have much faith?  I’ve never in my life dealt with anyone with alcoholism, and I don’t know how this all works. I don’t feel like I should have to support a 32 year old man at 23 years old. 

But I adore him...  I have a hard time picturing life without him. I could use some help, especially from someone who may have dealt with this before. There seems to be support for alcoholics, but not much for those who have to clean up the mess they’ve made. 

(TLDR: I’ve been supporting my alcoholic boyfriend for 6 months, and he finally agreed to go to rehab. I don’t know if I want to continue the relationship.)"
63,"I [15M] think my aunt [47F] is gay


I've been living with my aunt for a while because my parents moved abroad for my dad's job. I like living with her and she allows me more freedom than my parents. My aunt is close friends with a woman named Dee. To be honest, I thought Dee was a man when I first met her. She has very short hair, almost like a flat top, and wears men's clothes. She is way taller than my aunt too. When she spoke, that's when I realized she was a woman. I asked my aunt if Dee was a lesbian and she said yes. Now I think my aunt is a lesbian too and in a relationship with Dee. There are a couple of signs.

My aunt has a photo album full of pictures of her and Dee. Vacation photos, holiday photos, and just random photos of them.

Dee does stereotypical guy stuff for my aunt like heavy lifting and fixing her car.

They have dinner together almost every night. Either at home (where Dee sometimes cooks) or at a restaurant.

Dee refers to my aunt's cat as ""my/our"" baby. They apparently owned some other cats together.

My aunt being gay does not bother me. I think it would explain a lot, actually. My aunt is sorta the black sheep in the family. They mock her for being a spinster and not having children and her profession (she's a librarian). They think she's weird and boring. Our family basically alienates her in every way which is why I think she hasn't came out yet.

How do I let her know if she is gay, I'm okay with it and support her 100%?

TL;DR: I think my aunt is a lesbian"
64,"My(35M) wife(40F) of thirteen years cannot understand why I need down time


For the last two years, our lives have been extremely busy. My wife is a small business owner and I have a public-facing job that requires lot of our attention. When we go long stretches without personal space or downtime, I start feeling panicky and anxious and she knows this well. I believe it all stems from my two (27 months total) tours in Iraq where I would work 12 hours a day, 6.5 days a week. Even my half day off would often be interrupted by the mission. When I got home, I would get freaked out when personal time was violated. 

So, for weeks we have been planning a Netflix, hot cocoa, and pajamas kind of day, but by early afternoon, my wife has roped me into reorganizing the office, sending out multiple business related emails, and going through our investment portfolio with a fine toothed comb. She was over the moon pumped that her and I were able to complete so much in a day, but I could not hide the fact that I felt like a kid that was promised to go to the waterpark, but instead spent the day cleaning out the garage. I ended up sharing with her how I feel.

She cut me off and said she was disappointed that I feel that way. She claimed that a half day off is enough, because she sees off time as an opportunity to accomplish something. After a long arguement, we went to bed angry at each other, and she concluded that she will just go it alone and never ask me to help again. I feel she missed my point. I feel resentment growing and I find myself fantasizing about planning a vacation without her because I know she cannot stay down. I understand that we are busy, but this was our only day in over a month to ourselves. What can I do to find middle ground? 

TL;DR My wife loves to fill my free time with honey-dos while I am building resentment toward her that she cannot allow for solid time off."
65,"My (ex?)boyfriend [26M] observed my PIN-code, then accessed my phone while I [26F] was sleeping.


For the past half year I have been seeing the most amazing guy. We met under complicated circumstances and things have been complicated for some time, but I thought we were really good, especially for the past 2 months. I love him so much, and I think he knows that. I didn't realise that I have been making him upset and given him reason to be suspicious of me. I have never trusted anyone more than I trusted him, and it took me a lot to trust so automatically after my ex boyfriend pretty much destroyed me. I trusted him with logins, I trusted him if he was on my computer while I was away, and I had no problem with logging into social media on his computer or when around him. 

So it came as a complete shock when he told me that yesterday he decided to access my phone while I was sleeping. I've never given him the PIN, but I have never been scared of entering it in front of him. He told me that he accessed my phone while I was sleeping, in order to read through my conversation with my ex (whom I hate, but who still has some personal belongings of sentimental value that I really want to get back). Part of me can understand that he was suspicious and I know he had every right to be since I did talk a lot to my ex and it wasn't appropriate, but I am so hurt that he would do this, instead of asking me or even asking to see my phone. 

And to make it worse, he took photos of the contents of the chats. I don't know if I'm being hypocritical for being sad and feeling a bit betrayed. I just never would have done that to him, even if I was suspicious or felt that something was off. I think I would have confronted him or broken up, but I wouldn't have violated his privacy like that. Am I being unreasonable and dumb? Has anyone had something else happen, and how did you feel about it? Any advice?  


TLDR; boyfriend had reasons to be suspicious, but didn't ask me or confront me, he took my phone without permission while I was sleeping and went through chats and took photos. I feel betrayed, is it hypocritical of me?"
66,"My fiancée’s (f30) parents hate me (f31) for “turning their daughter gay”?


My fiancée is the apple of her parents’ eyes. She is extremely accomplished and is quite literally, their dream child — she graduated from a top university, she is crushing her career, she makes 200k+ a year which she uses to take her parents on fancy family vacations together, she was always a rule-follower and straight A student  as a kid, etc. She is also their only child. 

So they were obviously not pleased when she came out to them a year after me and her were seriously dating and had moved in together. For the first year I was mentioned occasionally as a “best friend” until she finally told them the truth.

The long story short of it is that her parents are convinced I had somehow taken advantage of their daughter and turned her gay. She had dated men previous to me in serious relationships (which fell apart because she “surprise” didn’t want sex with them), and her ex before me her parents had loved and wanted her to marry and they had fully embraced him as their future son in law.

Her parents right now pretend to tolerate me but I know they talk shit behind my back, there is ALWAYS a strained silence whenever I am around (they are chatting excitedly and then when I walk into a room, they go immediately silent and the conversation is awkward and strained, which of course makes me feel super shitty and unwelcome). 


Not once has her parents even TRIED to make me feel included. Instead they’ve even texted my fiancée about potentially setting her up with one of her dad’s coworker sons who is an Ivy League successful doctor, even when they knew we were in a serious relationship and living together. That incident made me super angry and I almost called them to tell them that is super disrespectful to our relationship and completely not okay, but my fiancée got upset that I was upset and “reacting badly” and we got in a huge fight about it where essentially I ended up backing down and we just pretended her parents never sent those texts. 

There have been some other instances where her parents have done hurtful things that she brushes under the rug. Some examples: trying to convince her to move back to her home state which would geographically separate us, asking “innocently” about prenups and hinting at it, sending us a freaking bible in the mail, insisting that their family vacations is only the three of them and that it would be weird if I joined (I’m not sure if her parents said this but my fiancée said it would be weird if I joined, and that it’s their family tradition for just the three of them).

I’m sick and tired of being treated like shit by her parents. It’s extremely hurtful and degrading and when I try to convey this to my fiancée her response is something along the lines of “well they’re my parents. They’re traditional and just want the best for me. What can you do. It’s just who they are”. 

Am I being unreasonable here? 

TLDR: my future in laws hate me for “turning their daughter gay” and I’m getting sick and tired of being hated by them "
67,"My (29F) boyfriend (30M) landed his dream job - and now he's lowkey pulling away


My boyfriend is smart, kind, thoughtful and giving. We understand each other intrinsically, have surmounted major emotional obstacles together and come out the other side, and love each other for all that we are. He's also very sensitive, anxious, and a nose to the grindstone guy who sometimes ""puts the blinders on"" when he's so wrapped up in work and forgets to eat and sleep and all that. Still, I have never met another soul like him and count myself lucky every day. 

Four years ago, he and I met in grad school in the US (we are UK citizens). We starting dating three years ago and moved in together two years ago, when I graduated from our program and started doing contract work to stay in the US. He graduated a year after me and got the same length of contract. He is now on his last year of the contract and I have already finished mine. So since August, I've been traveling between the US and the UK, staying with him for several weeks at a time, then going back to our home country and spending several weeks there, etc. I have savings and remote work income that has allowed me to do it without putting myself in dire financial straits.

In addition to being academics, we are also artists. Our artistic success affects how desirable we are in the job market. BF and I are in the same ""area"" of art, but have different niches - it's like both being visual artists, but he is an abstract painter who makes critically-lauded ""high-brow"" paintings and I am a sculptor who makes lucrative pop-art figurines. 

It's REALLY hard to get a well-paying secure job in our field, hence the contract work. I decided that, since I've been doing the bulk of the traveling and have done well enough selling my artwork so far, I would try to keep it up and perhaps look into full-time work once I had enough success with my art on my own. But this past year, BF decided he was going to shoot for it - he was gonna go for job security! 

I jumped into efficiency mode at his request and helped gather all the relevant positions we could find (which was ongoing throughout fall and winter), bought a bulletin for our study, made Google docs with all the deadlines and kept track of his call-backs. I took care of all the housework and shopping and lunch-making so he could concentrate on his current job and applications. 

Since he was applying to jobs in the US, Canada and UK we agreed that if he got offered a job somewhere outside our home country we would get married so I could move with him. We looked at rings together and he bought one (even showed me the box) but kept it in hidden and told me he'd reveal it when all the job dust settled. He was happy, I was happy, exciting times!

Right, so. The Present. I had to head back to the UK a few weeks ago. We've been inseparable as usual when together but now that I'm away, the communication has been cut back significantly (during previous stints home we'd call and text every day. This time it's been like...I've called every day, he never picks up; I stopped calling so often, now he calls me every 3-5 days). I'm a little sad about it but I know he's busy with work and stressed about all the interviews and waiting so I let it go. 

Last week he basically goes dark and I get no word from him all week. I spam his phone with calls because I'm GENUINELY WORRIED he's sick or something horrible happened. I'm like, ""I just want to know you're OK! Are you dead?!"" and he finally texts to say he'll call tomorrow. On the call, he tells me he got the call for the job offer of his DREAMS. It's one of those shoot for the moon positions he applied for just in case but believed he had little hope of getting. I'm all, YAY! and whooping and crying, I'm so happy for him. Then I'm like, ""When did you find out?!"" and he goes ""last weekend."" LAST. WEEKEND. He says he didn't want to tell anyone until he ""knew it was for real"". Oh, except for his parents. And his old advisor. And his best friend. 

I'm hurt but I swallow it and wait to bring it up for a few days - his is good news and I didn't want to tarnish it by being all ""What about MY feeeeelingssss."" When I mention it (literally, ""I love you and I am so happy for you and I wish I could be there to celebrate with you, but I do wish you'd told me sooner""), he immediately shuts down: he says he is SO stressed and I have NO IDEA, there is TOO MUCH work to be done between moving arrangements and staying on top of current job and I should keep it to myself. 

OK. Maybe it's true. I feel badly already because I'm just working on my projects, which is work but at a much slower pace, and he's bogged down with deadlines and presentations (plus he takes on a lot at work anyway, it's just the way he is). 

The thing is, I am starting to get a dreadful feeling about all this. Every time I get him on the phone, I can't seem to get any concrete info out of him about OUR situation. Where will we be living? He's talking to the HR person at the company he's going to work for who finds housing for their employees, but I hear no details. I ask, does he need my help and what can I do? He says he's got it handled. He's getting his visa sorted out, but when I ask him if he's talked to the lawyer about spousal visas he says ""I'll ask"" but I don't hear about it if he does. He won't give me a straight answer about when he wants me to come back and help pack our things, saying either that whatever date I give is ""too early"" or that we can discuss it later and he's busy. 

Twice he's even said ""I"" instead of we, but when I say ""we"" he doesn't correct me or even seem particularly awkward or bothered like I'd imagine he would be if he was keeping hesitations about our future from me. NEVERTHELESS. All this really isn't him, and it's making me worried that he legit has second thoughts about his future with me - that maybe he'd rather just start fresh in this new place with this new job? 

Reddit, WTF is going on with the man I love? Has work made him squirrelly, is he mad about me being unable to be in the country while he's swamped with stuff to do OR is a really horrible break-up surprise going to hit me out of nowhere?

**tl;dr I (29F) supported my boyfriend (30M) when he went all-in to try to get the job of his dreams in another country. He got the offer, but didn't tell me he got it for a week. Now he's acting evasive when I try to start planning for our marriage and our move together as previously discussed. What gives: am I overanalyzing or do you think he's mulling making the move solo?**"
68,"Father of Three Feeling Gutter. Spouse sent pics of herself to Childs coach.


TLDR: Wife sending Bra pics to children coach, is this divorce worthy.

&amp;#x200B;

Throwaway account for reasons. I am married with 3 kids and heading for a divorce. I just cannot bring myself to do it.

In the past my wife has had affairs. She cheated on me for several years ending 7 years ago. 3 years ago she came clean about her affairs, went to counseling and things have been pretty good. I was definitely upset as we had two more children together once the affair ended.

Fast forward to 2019, She has gone back to work part time and is also going to school. January was stressful for her and she has been staying up later studying and drinking. I asked her about the wine consumption and she exploded on me. I thought that was out of character but it reminded me of how she acted during her affair.

I have been doing everything I could to support her, changing my work schedule so I can be with the kids earlier in the day when they get out of school. I do the practices, clean the house, playdates, laundry, 1/2 the cooking....and so on. I have really been trying to be Mr. Mom

February was terrible, several explosions at me for things that were not a big deal and lots of drinking. I found out from another parent that my wife sent some pictures of herself to one of our children coaches. I asked her about it and she told the truth eventually, I have asked her that if she is saying the conversations were harmless, she should show them to me, she is refusing to do so.

So basically she is drinking at night and texting this guy, refuses to show me the details claiming I am a controlled freak. She insists she no longer speaks to him and honestly I don't care anymore.

Is it wrong for me to ask to see the conversations?

Considering the past behaviors, is this divorce worthy? My head says yes but my heart is tearing apart thinking of not being with the kids."
69,"My wife no longer does anything that she (or what I think a companion) should do. She spends hours every day talking to kids online (non-sexual), pretending to be my 12-yr old daughter. Is this the end?


I believe in keeping oaths and promises, but I am at the end of my rope. I will try to be succinct. Please advise. I am looking, first, to make this work.  41F, 45M

Please ask me for details or any important details I may have missed. 

&amp;#x200B;

She hasn't been intimate with me in 3 years. Yes, sex, or any other intimacy. 

6 years ago, she told me that my snoring/heavy-breathing kept her awake and I have since slept in the downstairs guest bedroom. She has not once come down to be with me even in a social/companionship way. For the first 4 years I went upstairs to our former shared bedroom and ""hung out"" with her. 

She has been obsessed with my daughter's social life since pre-k / Kinder. I used to get daily updates on my daughter's social life. She is 12 now. My daughter has a very active social life. She also has a very active social media life with 100K+ followers on several places. But this was mostly HER (my daughter). My wife has been pretending to be my daughter for the last 3 1/2 years and chats for up to 5-6 hours per day with all her friends, particularly boys. I monitor all chats (she doesn't know) and there is nothing overtly sexual. I believe my wife does have a big problem. I wish she could be helped but has refused. 

Recently (last 5 months) she has very much ignored me. She is glued to her phone. She will walk out of a room when I enter. She will not answer my questions when I talk to her because she is busy typing away. 

She does not work. I have had maids 3x or 2x week for many years. Recently we stopped and she BARELY (a few dishes) keeps the house. I've tried to encourage her to go to school, work, get a fulfilling hobby. She believes in ""gender roles"" (me not so much), and this is where I struggle. I work a lot and bring home plenty. She does maybe 10% in traditional gender roles. Again, don't agree with those but that is her thing. She used to cook every day. Now 3 times per month. I have started cooking. I clean bathroom, floors, etc. She does this MAYBE once per year. In other words, she is consumed by other things and has let everything else go.

This first years of our marriage she wanted to be with me every day. We shared almost everything. She planned activities as a family. She planned things with me. Now: NOTHING. Ok I am not being honest. She will plan about 1-2 things per month compared to 15-20. 

My dilemma: There is something wrong. She won't see a doc or psych. But what do I do? I am committed and faithful but I also need to consider my own well-being and the rest of my life. My daughter is also seeing a terrible example (there is so much more to this story, of course) and I fear that she is being led in the wrong direction. 

What are my options? I am looking for constructive, applicable advise. Thank you all Reddit. I've seen you come through for so many people!!

70,"I (24f) want my boyfriend(26m) to take care of himself/appearance but I don't want to hurt his feelings...so I say nothing.


So this one makes this makes me feel reallllly shallow. My boyfriend and I have been together for 5+ years and we live together. We are very close etc etc.. Lately, I have been starting to feel resentful... I feel we are unequal in how we take care of ourselves. I exercise regularly, I buy lingerie because I think it's fun and sexy, and I enjoy being something he desires. I make a point to look nice when we go out. I know he likes and appreciates these things because he tells me...

Him : hasn't cut his hair in 3 years, its super long but IDK if its a look that's working for him. He can't grow a full beard it's kind of patchy, but he doesn't shave it. He never ever exercises and eats really poorly. I try and tell myself these things don't matter, and that I love him for who he is ... but I always start to feel annoyed that i keep myself shiny and bright but he doesn't really try. He often looks in the mirror and asks me if he is getting ""squishy"". He even expresses that he is worried I wished I was with someone super ""chiseled"" because of my appearance. I don't know what to do -- so I lie. I know this is bad. He doesn't even need to be super buff or chiseld -- I don't care. It's really more about the effort he puts into himself and his wellness that would be attractive to me.

When we first started dating, he went on runs and regularly groomed himself. This was attractive to me. He didn't really LOOK that much different. I think this is mostly because I just like that he was taking care of himself... and ""trying."" In a non-direct way it made me feel like he wanted to look good for me.

TL;DR How do I tell my boyfriend he needs to take better care of himself without breaking his confidence and heart? I have told him before I would love if he was healthier because I care about him but nothing ever changes.

71,"He [35] and I [34] are having a hard time adjusting to the first year of marriage and it's triggering my fight or flight


My husband and I are having a hard first year of marriage.  The good news is, we're realistic that it's not supposed to be sunshine and roses all the time, but I've been having a hard time keeping everything in perspective lately and could use some advice.  

*For some background:  My husband moved from halfway across the country to be with me where we are for logistical reasons, I own a house, have a thriving career, and a bunch of other stuff that made it much harder to work the other way around, although it was considered.* 

**My point of view:**  I make a significant amount of money, and if he doesn't want to work again, he doesn't have to.  However, if he doesn't work, then the house should be cleaned to my expectations, and chores that I would normally do should come off my plate.  Also, if I ask for something like ""can you take these boxes to good will"" it should be accomplished in a reasonable time frame (within the week).  

He says he wants to work though, so we have been working on setting up his business, and if he's not going to do the above, he should be focusing on the business.  He should be studying for the placement tests he needs to take (there are three) or he should be out trying to find work for that business.  

In short, he should be just as busy as I am during the work week even if he's not ""working"".

**His point of view:**  I'm kind of piecing this together from the various fights we've had, but he seems to think that I am either project managing / micromanging him (which he believes he doesn't need) or he's depressed about the current state of affairs.  (That he's up here without friends or family or a steady job.)  However, even though he's depressed, he's unwilling or unable to do anything about it to get out of that funk because ""wait it out.""  This ultimately leads to many fights because I have expectations that aren't met, and his default response is either, ""If you wanted it done so badly do it yourself"" ""I don't hit or cheat on you, you're being over demanding"" ""You're such a bitch / I don't know why I'm with you."" 

**My Problem:** My biggest problem with this is that before we got married we had plans and goals and things we were working toward together, in fact, his ring has an inscription on the inside that says ""You make my dreams come true.""  Instead, I feel like I ended up with someone who has no ambition, who truly does need someone to micromanage him to get something accomplished, and who has actually set me back from my dreams.  I feel like once we got married he decided he no longer had to put in effort so while I am still working to improve his and our life by helping set up his business, etc - he's perfectly content to sleep until noon, and just sit around the house and watch Twitch. 

I'm fearful that no matter how much fun we have together that this relationship will never survive because I feel like I was told in the beginning he was a hard worker, dedicated to getting ahead, and had goals he wanted to accomplish (like me) and instead, I got someone who has none of the qualities.  

And what's even more frustrating is that I personally can't tell if this is a deal breaker for me or not.  Because aside from this issue (which admittedly is large) we are very happy.  We both are of the same mind with regards to kids, we both have the same interests, we both have a lot of fun and enjoy each others company and have the same sense of humor and have a great sex life, he's supportive of my career and my ambitions... and I know that no relationship is perfect so I personally feel as though maybe I am just asking too much and I am too demanding?  (This would not be the first time I've heard this from people either...) 

So some perspective could be useful, as I said.  

**TL;DR: My husband and I have different ideas of what our relationship should look like at this point in the first year of marriage, how do I adjust my expectations or decide if it is truly a deal breaker?**"
72,"I think my ex (32f) may lose her children's respect in the future


I recently brought up some things to my ex wife about her new husband. My kids have told me some things about him and the way they talk about him that bothered me. He seems very controlling and demands things that he shouldn't be doing regardless of him being with my ex. However, recently my oldest (10m) told me that he wanted him to pick his favorite parent he loved the most and he had to choose one of us. I waited on this. Took some time to talk to my son to see if this was something he may have made up, but he brought it up more and it really bothered him. He even asked me to talk to my ex about it.

&amp;#x200B;

Well, I sent her an email on it. I kept it nice, short and didn't point any blame. I even sent it to a few people who know her well and said that it looked great. However, she still took offense to it and started blaming me for random things that made no sense. She said her new guy is perfect and would never do that.

&amp;#x200B;

Now, here is where I tell you about him. He was cheating on his wife with my ex and knocked her up shortly after that. I've never really liked either of them because she has a history of it and I'm finding out he is kind of a douche. However, I know she loves our boys. I know she wants whats best for them, but I feel that if she doesn't shape up and actually address these things they may lose their respect for her and it is truly the last thing I want. I'm not sure where I can go from here.

tl;dr - my ex is ignoring signs from our oldest about the negative relationship him and his step-father are having"
73,"My (30) husband (6 years together, one year married, 30) 'doesn't know' if this is his baby


Background - 
My mother was an abusive asshole growing up. When I was very young, maybe 7ish, she caught me masturbating. No big deal? I was branded a whore and treated badly from then on. When my brother was born, I wasn't allowed to see his penis. I had boy friends before then, and I suddenly wasn't allowed to be around them. I wasn't allowed to go swimming with boys. A girl friend's mom told her about a conversation she'd overheard while we were having a sleep over. We were talking about sex and what it meant/was and we were about 11. My mother forbid me from having sleep overs with that particular girl ever again, and when I would have sleep overs with other girls, she made it clear to their parents we were not allowed to sleep in the same bed together. 
Basically I grew up with a lot of body shame and confusion about what sex was. I didn't realize the mechanics of it until I was 18 and had sex for the first time. It took me years of therapy to recover from emotional and physical abuse as a kid. My therapist and I agreed that limiting contact with my mother was best for me. I barely talked to her for over a decade. My father recalls many of my stories and has apologized for not protecting me. 

My husband urged me to be more friendly with my mother because she's going to be a grandmother. Over the last 6 months I've tried, and we told her the news in February. 
Thursday he called her to ask some questions for a genetic test because he's been worried about it, and the first thing she said after 'how are you doing' was 'are you sure this is your baby?' The pain of childhood flooded back hearing her say that over speaker, and I immediately shouted that she should go fuck herself, something I have never said to my mother no matter how much I've wanted to. His reaction was just as painful. 'I'm assuming so.' Not an immediate yes of course, wtf is wrong with you witch. I felt like I was being slapped in the face. 

Tonight he tells me he's really bothered by what she said and isn't confident it is his baby. Today was the day we found out we're having a daughter. It was an emotionally high day for me, for us, to end with 'I'm second guessing if your mother is on to something and you really are hopping on whatever dick you can find.' 

Tonight I blew up. Told him I'd pay for the paternity test myself as soon as she was born, before we even took her home, so he could sleep at night. Told him that for the next 7 months I was going to have this hanging over me, knowing that despite how hard I tried to track my ovulation and make sure we had sex on the right days, and no matter how excited we were to find out we are parents, and that our dream came true when we found out we're having a girl because we'd already picked out her name, that he can just trash it all and trash me so easily.
I told him I regret putting in the effort to get pregnant, since this is how it is.

How do you get past something like this? I have been good and honest and loving and it's like all of that has been snatched up, thrown in a dumpster, and the whole thing set on fire. I want my daughter here already so that I can hold her tight and cry. So I can point out that she has his eyes or his curly hair or his nose. I'm so excited to see her and touch her and see him in her. But will he ever feel that way? 

And should I go off on my mother like I want to? I've never actually gone off on her. This morning she texted HIM and asked if everything was okay because she hadn't heard from us 'in a while' (like, over the weekend? After you insulted me and I said the F word to my mother? This is a game she plays where she pretends everything is fine). I want to rant at her and punch her in her mouth. But at the same time I want her to just go away and leave me alone and even acknowledging her gives her power she doesn't deserve to have. And it won't make me feel loved by my husband. It won't make me feel like he's got my back, that he respects me.

74,"Boss (40sM) says he doesn't care about my (27f) work nor give me projects on purpose


I work for a large company in my dream field. I generally really enjoy my work and like my colleagues. I have been here for less than two years and had my current manager for about half a year.  We have been working together since we both started though.


In a meeting recently my manager openly admitted that he does not care about my work and that he has knowingly not given me projects because he does not want someone other than himself get the credit. For me this was totally insane: I am his employee, not competition! I was so baffled I didn't even get angry: I just tried to convince him how he should think of the good of the team too and that my success is also his success, but it didn't really sink in.


I have been quite often in situations in which I don't have enough work. I had previously thought that he, being new to managing, just didn't really know 'how to' give me work - I never thought he was doing it on purpose! After this a lot of other things he has done/said that I previously dismissed as misunderstandings have kinda clicked in place. I have started seeing him in a totally different light and fear for how he talks about me to other people higher up.

I love my job here, but I also recognise this situation is not sustainable. This is pretty much breaking my heart. I already had to leave my previous job two years ago due to toxic management so it sucks to have problems again. How should I move forward?

Tldr: Boss (40sM) says he doesn't care about my (27f) work nor give me projects on purpose, what to do?"

When we first started dating, we were discussing our exes and I alluded that I had broken up with mine 6 months before we met, despite the fact that it had really been only 4 months. I’m not sure why I did it - I was scared of how I’d be perceived to already be dating only 4 months after my breakup instead of 6? But now it’s been over a year since we met, 10 months since I first told the lie and they’ve become an important part of my life. I’m afraid they’ll find out through friends of mine or family. I know that the actual truth is inconsequential - I don’t think it changes anything nor would it have from the start. But I feel so much guilt for it and feel like I should confess. It doesn’t come up often, but when it does I feel overwhelmed by perpetuating this lie. 

What do I do? How do I handle it? 

TLDR: I lied at the beginning of my relationship and now I’m afraid of it coming out, even though the lie isn’t really important. "
76,"I'm dating the ""Well, actually..."" guy


I'm 25F and my SO is 26M. We've been together for 3.5 years.  Tl;dr at the bottom

I don't know if he has always been like this or if it's something I only just noticed recently, but my boyfriend has been driving me insane lately. Every time we have a discussion, he gets so hung up on some negligible detail and he *has* to correct me on it. It isn't annoying that he is correcting me, it's just annoying the way he does it. He casually insults my intelligence and hypes himself up as a superior mind. He's disrespectful sometimes and it grinds my gears.

Often he corrects me when I'm actually trying to articulate the same exact idea, and he just gets hung up on the syntax and won't let it go. He will assume the worst of my intelligence and go on a long-winded explanation of why I'm wrong when I literally just said the same damn thing (or tried to). This has been happening every time we hang out lately and it really sours my mood when he says, ""well, *actually*..."" and then basically repeats what I just said.

Other times we will be discussing topics he knows more about, and I will be 100% incorrect about something. It's great that I have someone to let me know I've got the wrong info, but his approach is insulting. We both work in tech-support jobs, so we are both used to correcting folks and explaining concepts. What I don't like is when he finishes explaining a concept to me and then says something like, ""It's fine, I explain these things to stupid people all day.""

I've begun seeing it with his family too. He is very smart. I get it. We all get it. But what is the point of tearing people down and acting like he is a god because he knows a tidbit they didn't know? It could be about history, music, math, science, doesn't matter. He seeks out opportunities in conversation to correct people and hang his superior knowledge over their heads. 

""Well, *actually*, if you paid even the slightest bit of attention, you'd know xyz. *I* just know these things because *I* like to pay attention to useful information like that... So I don't have to rely on other people to tell me the way y'all rely on me to tell you.""

Ughh. He is my best friend and I cherish him, but I wonder how to tell someone who is ""always right"" that their approach is all wrong. Any advice?

Tl;dr
My boyfriend corrects people in the most obnoxious, big-headed way possible. How can I tell someone like that to change their approach?

(Sorry for the repost, I goofed up the title the first time)"
77,"Am I [25F] walking dead bedroom or does my boyfriend [32M] have old fashioned ideas of women?


We have been together 16 months. Long distance for 10 of those (exciting bedroom antics during our 1 week/2 week visits and lots of sexting/skype). We met travelling and did back and forth dating/relationshipping before I moved from one side of the world to the other to close the distance. 

Long story short he has mentioned we don’t have sex as often as he would like and he says I don’t initiate enough. I understand why he feels that way. 

I have always had this problem, ex boyfriends have said it too. I don’t know if it’s normal, I rarely feel turned on. But if I engage when he initiated then I will soon (5-10 mins) feel turned on and enjoy it. Because of this I never think to initiate but will most of the time respond to his initiations (and enjoy it and participate) so we have sex two to three times a week. 

Last night I thought we hadn’t had sex in a while and whilst I wasn’t really 100% ‘in the mood’ I had a sort of realisation that he might be waiting for me to initiate and that if I didn’t maybe a lot of time would pass before I did. Anyway so I did, I was on top for a little while (this is uncomfortable for me) then we switched, he finished, I didn’t (usually I do but it takes me a long time so if it’s not going to last 20+ mins then sometimes it’s not worth trying - this kind of annoys me a bit in principle because If you’re not finishing then why would you want to have sex but sometimes it Is A LOT of effort for me to orgasm and we both get frustrated).
 
To the point - somehow tonight we ended up arguing because it came up again after six weeksish of it being mentioned that I don’t initiate and we haven’t had enough sex lately and when we do it’s always him doing the work. I was confused since I did last night. He said he thinks I only did that because I was turned on and wanted to orgasm so used him by going on top for a bit before switching to him being behind. 

Can someone please give me some advice here. I’m under the impression that he wants to have sex with me everyday because he is horny and wants to orgasm (obviously it’s more than that as it’s nice to feel close and connected which is another reason why I initiated last night). He also mentioned how I don’t do enough during sex because I’m always wanting to go into ‘angles’ or positions (mostly lying down or in front) cause it’s hard for me to finish and I need to do what I know works. 

And then it escalated hugely because I said he didn’t respect me and he was hurt because he does a lot for me to try help me settle in. I think he is stressed out having me here and feeling the pressure as I am lonely and it’s a big move and potentially I am upset about being lonely a lot (which I’m feeling bad for as he is trying but he can’t solve that I have to!). 

Is he old fashioned and thinks from watching porn I am supposed to be this consistently sexual performer that’s ultra intense and orgasm easy OR am I just a boring non sexual weirdo since this has been brought up before?

Tldr- boyfriend upset I don’t initiate more often. I initiated but didn’t do it how he wants"
78,"UPDATE: My dad (54) comments disgusting things about young women he doesn't even know, and I'm not sure what to do


Original post: https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/ay4ogp/my_dad_54_comments_disgusting_things_about_women/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share


Alright, so I ended up talking to my grandma, saying things like that I was uncomfortable around him because of him doing all of this. I went back and looked at the pictures earlier today and realized now how young these women actually are.

Yes, they are models. But I don't feel comfortable with my dad doing this. I'm about their age.

My grandma told me to tell my mom, so I did. We talked for about 45 minutes, and we both agreed that I no longer have to see him.

She's going to talk with him on the 10th of March (didn't say Sunday cause that might be tomorrow for some of you), and I'm going to go to my grandparents house while this happens.

I have told my mom that I will not immediately forgive him, and if he doesn't change his behaviour around me I will continue to be uncomfortable in his presence, and most likely never see or talk to him again.

Of course, I don't EXPECT him to immediately stop saying these things. He is a human, and he makes mistakes. We all do. I just don't want to see him or talk to him until he's ""better"". 

Oh, did I also mention he wolf whistled (perhaps jokingly) at me when I was 9? Not okay. Everyone agreed he was being a creep.


TL;DR: I talked to my grandma, she told me to talk to my mom, and I'm temporarily going NC (no contact) on my dad."
79,"My [35F] neighbor [70F] is causing me to be a prisoner in my own home. I can't go on like this.


The issues started three years ago, before that she had lived there for many years and caused no issues. The issues began when I began feeding wild birds, she reported me to the authorities. Nothing came of it but since then she has had it out for me.

I used to have four battery hens, she complained about them too. So much so that my remaining two (the others have since passed away) have now practically become house hens and only have a small area out the side of the house to roam (the area is sandwiched between  the side of my house and the side of a nice neighbors house, nasty neighbor cannot see them there as she is behind me and I have put up plasterboard so she cannot see the side area of my house. Nasty neighbor's house is positioned above mine so she can look straight into my back garden. It's pretty much a fishbowl.

My friend came over one day with her dog, the nasty neighbor saw him and called noise control even though he made no noise and was only out there for about ten minutes maximum before we went to the park. Neighbor also reported my cat for apparently digging up her plants so the cat is now a house cat. When I go into the back garden she looks down and stares at me. She has tampered with my back gate to try to get into my property. She called the council to come out and inspect a large tree I have in the back garden to see if it meets the height restrictions (it's the only bit of privacy I have). She does drive bys of my house. She stares at me when I mow the lawn, I was reported for that too. I have caught her trying to look into a room in my house, now I have to have the curtains permanently drawn. I can't hang washing out without her staring at me. 

So for the past year I have practically only been living in a quarter of my property so she can't see me as much. I have to think very carefully about what I do in my own home so I don't get another complaint. I'm scared she'll find out about my hens and cat and complain about their living environment and get them taken away even though she  made them live like that (the council can take hens away if neighbours complain about the noise). I want to rescue more battery hens and use the back coop and my yard for them to roam in again but I can't. I can't risk them being taken from me. I can't feed birds as the council said I'd get a fine next time, feeding them used to give me so much joy. I have to use more power to dry my clothes. I have to pay for a company to look after my back garden. I'm scared I'll get an order to remove my tree soon as I've caught her looking at it. I can't play music. I can't enjoy the sun in the back garden or have dinner outside (something I used to love doing) because she's always watching. Oh and I can't have the bathroom light on at night either as she complained it reflected into her windows. So I even have to go toilet in the dark. 

I complained to her property manager about her two years ago but nothing happened. I'm at a loss. I can't carry on like this. I want her to know what she's done to me. Im permanently scared now, always on edge, always playing scenarios in my head about what might happen next. I can hardly sleep and had to get sleeping pills. I can't afford to move. I'm so afraid. This has taken over my life. 

TL;DR: Neighbor making my life hell."
80,"My[27F] BF [27M] has been meeting his Ex-GF behind my back for the past year. I don't know what to make out of it. Please help me.


 Reposted as it was initially removed.

I will try keep this really short and concise, apologies if I am all over the place, today I found out about this

&amp;#x200B;

I meet my current BF last year (2018) in July , when both of us we were in relationships with other people. About one month after we met, he told me he broke-up with his GF of 5 years.. She was living in his home country, so I have never met her and all I know about her it's based on his account. He told me that they were on and off for 5 years, a time during which both of them slept with a lot of other people. From what I heard from him their relationships has always been on the rocks, she was cold, withholding sex from him, letting him sleep outside on the street. This sounds like a pretty horrible relationship to me, isn’t it? So, back in August 2018 he told me he was single and they cut contact and I was also single at that time so we start dating.

&amp;#x200B;

Since then we had our up and downs, but we have generally an okay relationship (despite him being a bit unstable when it comes to the future of our relationship). **I had no reasons to doubt his faithfulness towards me, until today...when I open a social media website and I see that he has been tagged in a picture by his EX where the caption went like: “ This cake is waiting for you “my bf’s name” so hurry up to my place before I have it all”**. I f\*cking froze. I started scrolling through her profile and saw lots of random pictures in which he was tagged (about books, movie, memes, whatever, you name it). He liked all her pictures.

&amp;#x200B;

As far as I was concerned, he told me he was visiting his family back home last week (the date of the picture is from last week). So today I picked up my phone and very calmly asked him what’s that picture about. His reply : “I was supposed to meet her, but I didn’t have time anymore”. Me: “you told me you are not in close contact. How many times did you meet her since you broke up”? Him: “every time I went back to my home country, but it wasn’t important so I forgot to tell you”. Me: “So that’s twice every month. She lives 3 hours away from your hometown”. Him: “yes, she does”. The conversation ended here because I was at work and my boss wanted to talk to me at that point.

&amp;#x200B;

I am going maaaad here Reddit. I am dying on the inside. Do I have any reason to believe that this man has been cheating on me? Maybe he never broke up with her, maybe he had a double life this whole time? How do I approach this without looking like a psycho crazy and pushing him away (in case he is innocent) ? But things don’t add up, he told me they are done, that she treated him horribly, why would you go out of your way to meet a person like that so often?? he never mentions her and he does he goes out of his way to berate her?

&amp;#x200B;

**TL;DR**

BF said he hasn’t been in touch at all with his ex since last year, but apparently he has been visiting her twice per month without telling me anything about it. Do I have reasons to suspect he has been living a double life? How do I approach this conversation with him without exploding and yelling?"
81,"I (25F) had a weird and disturbing past with High school Physics teacher (60-somethingM) and he has been trying to find me at work 3 times these past 2 weeks. I am scared.


I'm sorry for any format issues, I'm on mobile.

Some background:
When I was in high school (I was 17), I had this physics teacher who tutored me together with this other girl. At one point, he started asking me to stay after class because he had some extra stuff he needed to discuss.. it was always just him rambling about his home situation and how he felt unappreciated by students etc. I felt uncomfortable but I also felt bad for him, so I listened to him rant. He started to do this more and more and I started to feel really uncomfortable. He also started to touch my shoulders or my back and when I flinched he would tell me I could relax. I was struggling with anorexia and bad anxiety at the time and really didn't know how to tackle this situation.

After I graduated, I went to study chemistry at uni. He appeared to teach some classes at that same uni. One time, in my first year of uni, he saw me and was saying how I abandoned him, because I didn't visit him at the old high school. He also said I was a parasite and that I was just using people for my own gain. He said I gave him a really bad summer and that he never met anyone who lacked more character than me. I started shaking and I told him he didn't have the right to talk to me like that. I started crying and he just told me to stop crying. I told him to stop contacting me and I left. 

It's a couple of years later now, and I hadn't heard from him. I only saw him sometimes when he would teach but our uni is pretty big, so I just made sure I'd get the f out of there. 

Now:
Two weeks ago I suddenly saw my teacher in front of the department that I work in (I'm a PhD student) and I just turned the other way and waited until he was gone. 2 days later he was there again. Last week he came again when I was in a meeting and someone told me he told them to tell me he stopped by. My heart sunk. My boyfriend knows about the whole story and he advised me to send my teacher an email and being firm that I don't want to see him. 

I sent him a very short email saying that I heard he was looking for me and that I could reply through email. Today he replied, saying that he is retiring soon and wants to talk about my research. He then also wrote this part about himself how he's been feeling bad in life and how the school is going to regret treating him the way that he did.

I really just want to send him an email saying I don't want to meet. But.. I'm really scared he'd makea scene like he did when he was calling me names and I'm scared he'll keep looking for me at work. I don't know what to do and I am really scared.

I'm sorry for my long post, thank you so much for reading. Could anyone give me some advice please? I'd be forever grateful! 

Tldr; high school teacher has shown disturbing behavior towards me and suddenly wants to know how I'm doing after 6 or so years.

82,"I [18M] deliberately haven’t seen my brother [25M] ever since he moved out because of the way he treated me when we were younger. I’m beginning to feel like I’m being the jerk.


He moved out about a year ago. I feel like he had been unnecessarily cruel to me my whole childhood. He would punch my arm multiple times until I cried, a few of my things had been destroyed by him because I or someone else angered him, and everything I did, he criticized.

I’m gay and completely closeted, but my voice is a little feminine sounding, so I guess some people would already assume. He has mocked my voice, and he has joked about me having a boyfriend. Whenever I did something that even slightly annoyed him, he would yell “faggot” at me.

I remember this one horrible morning. I was feeling extremely depressed (something happened that made me feel like my world had crashed down, but that’s a different story), and I was laying in bed way longer than usual. He came in my room, and demanded that I get out of bed. I told him to leave and he pulled me out of bed. I started bawling face down on the floor. He pressed his foot down on the back of my head and made a point of how much of a “pussy” I was.

He had, and still has, this attitude like he’s better than everyone else. Whenever we would go out in public, he couldn’t be bothered to hold doors open behind him, and it would slam on anyone who was was behind him. When someone is standing in his way, he bumps them out of the way. He doesn’t like the job my mom has, so she’s a “loser” according to him, and he makes sure to tell her that.

My grandmother has noticed that we don’t see each other, and texts me how she wishes we could get along, and how he really loves me, he just has a weird way of showing it. She claims that he actually cares for me because he’s made sure I always get great gifts for birthdays and Christmas (which he has). He himself has said that other families are way worse, and that he didn’t do anything to me. I feel like maybe I should see him and just deal with him.

I’m just really conflicted right now.

TL;DR: I choose not to see my brother, and I’m beginning to feel bad for it."
83,"My [25F] boyfriend [26M] of six months constantly criticizes my food choices


He just has this thing where he's very picky about what he eats but he also criticizes what I eat, and I don't eat badly, it's really mundane stuff so I'll just give some examples so it becomes apparent. 

For instance I'll eat pasta and he'll say that I should eat whole wheat pasta instead as it's better for my glycogen level and keeps my energy level high over the day. When I ate 70% cocoa chocolate he told me it'd be better if I tried to switch to 90%, it would take a little while to get used to the slightly more bitter taste but that the 90 was higher in fat and he had be tracking my macros closely and I should probably up my relative fat intake and scale down on fast carbs to keep my hormonal levels in check. When I ate a banana he claimed I should eat them before my workout rather and that kiwis were the superior fruit in regards to taste and micronutrients.

It's a bit annoying. How do I get him to stop?

**tl;dr**: Boyfriend criticizes a lot of the food choices I make "
84,"My [29m] partners [27f and 25f] came up in a commune. We left together. I'm worried about whether one of them will adjust to a ""normal"" life.


I grew up in a commune in the PNW. I suppose you could call it a cult, but that isn't the word I would use. Believe me, or don't. I get all sorts of reactions on the rare occasion I talk about where I grew up.

Polygamy was allowed and encouraged, as part of the ""free love"" philosophy the founders believed in.
When I was 18 I got sent out into society to learn a skill that was needed for our community. I succeeded, and returned. My reward for that was an arranged ""marriage""(not legally recognized), when I was 20 and she was 19. 

I know that is all sorts of fucked up and I knew it to an extent at the time, but it was normal within our community and myself, my wife, and the others were happy enough to go along with it.

For the record, I have never been and never would be mean or abusive to my partners.

I was married again five years later. Basically there was a girl in the community and her parents felt I was a success and therefore good husband material, so they asked me to take her. She seemed to like me and my first wife, so I agreed.

So I've been with my first wife nine years, the second one for four.

As we grew, we had our doubts about the community we were in. The three of us ultimately decided to leave, so we packed our stuff into a pickup truck and left 18 months ago. Times were hard for a bit, but we found an apartment eventually, and I've been working to support us.

The girls don't have much of an identity as far as the government is concerned, and no real skills useful in regular society, so they are fairly dependent on me as would have been expected in our community.

I have told both of them that I don't expect them to stay if they don't want to. They shrug and ask where they would go without me, and still consider me their husband, at the end of the day. I think we have something resembling ""normal"" love, or maybe just comfort.

My first wife is adjusting alright. She goes out more and more on her own and is now talking of going to college, that I fully support.

But we worry for my second wife. She's afraid of everything outside. She doesn't leave home. She refuses to go the hospital if hurt or sick. She's barely able to leave home unless myself or my first wife go with her.

I have recommended a therapist, one who specializes in reintroducing someone to society after groing up in an ""alternative"" environment, but she flat refuses to go, and I don't feel that forcing her would be productive.

Whatever my own sins were in the past, I'm responsible for her now I feel, and I'll take care of her forever if I need to. But I want her to enjoy her life, and I don't think she is now. How can I convince her to try therapy, or at least try participating in society?

**TL;DR**: Grew up in a ""free community"". Left with my two partners. One is not adjusting and we worry for her."
