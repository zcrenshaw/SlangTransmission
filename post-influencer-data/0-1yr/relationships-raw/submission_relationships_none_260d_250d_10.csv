0,"I've (30F) finally decided that I'm not comfortable with drugs. My SO (39M) does the ocassional recreational drugs. How can we come to a compromise?


TL;DR: As per the title.

I've done enough research and talking to friends over the last 1 year of our relationship to come to this conclusion. I can accept that with enough risk management, my SO can handle his drugs (weed, ecstacy, shrooms, others I might not know of - the ""safe drugs"" generally).

However, I grew up in a very conservative environment in Asia. I used to think only non-productive members of society engaged in drug taking behaviour. Imagine my shock when I was offered weed for the first time when I was 25! I had also studied substance abuse in college and my core group of friends do not touch any sort of drugs at all and some don't even drink. I'm a moderate, infrequent drinker, I've never smoked, don't party. And of course, absolutely no drugs, including weed. I am not religious.

I also have a history of mental health issues and used to abuse alcohol. Knowing I have an addictive personality, I need to stay away as much as possible from any substances.

My SO drinks even less than I do, smokes, vapes, parties, needs a holiday once every 2-3 months, enjoys strip clubs...you get the picture. We are almost like different species! Yes, we could date other people more similar to us, but we like each other enough to want to at least try to work past this.

Having newly made the decision that I myself will never touch drugs, I've also realised that my SO engaging in drug taking makes me uncomfortable. I would like to explore ground rules that will be a fair compromise for both of us.

My must-haves are:

- He gives up his annual rave party in Vietnam where he does E

- He and his friends must never pressure me into doing drugs and I will not forbid him from doing drugs

I would like to hear experiences and get advice on how we can compromise and what would be reasonable for my SO (because obviously I would rather he not do any drugs at all but that would be unfair to him) and even explore my discomfort with my SO doing drugs.

e.g. him doing drugs in front of me or engaging with me while he's under the influence would make me uncomfortable. Is that reasonable?

I do not need to be convinced to partake or be okay with drugs. I don't concern myself with the handful of friends who do drugs but I need to be at least in the same book, if not the same page, as my SO. He's turning 40 soon and wants to settle down (but giving up drugs and raves is not part of his idea of settling down). I want to settle down to a stable lifestyle with a stable partner.

Thank you!"
1,"Yet another question about a guy


So there is this guy [25M] that I [27F] work with. I’ve known him for a few months. We became closer as friends (I think) but lately I can’t be sure because we became closer physically as well (no kissing though). We went out -just the two of us- after the office Christmas party (his idea) and at one point we were sort of cuddling and he was playing with my hair or I was playing with his. People actually said we were a cute couple but I said we were just friends. Then on New Years even though I said I wanted to stay at home he managed to convince me to go out with him and a few other friends. He even told them if I didn’t go out that night he would probably come over to my place to watch a movie or something. Again we only hugged that night. He just confuses me because he does things like pushing my hair out of my face, asking me if he can kiss me before giving me a peck on the cheeks or holding my hands to warm them up or deeper things like telling me intimate secrets,etc. However as I’ve observed he seems to be naturally flirty and flirts with others too. I really don’t want to read a lot into his behaviour and make things awkward. He also got out of a serious relationship 3 months ago and seems to be still hurting. I really don’t want to be his rebound. 


TL;DR When is touching considered flirty and not just friendly?"
2,"Rude GF? not sure what to do.. (F20) (M22)


Alright so where do I begin.. December of 2017 my family decides to go into the city to watch Fireworks for NYE, tickets are $170 each. My family knows I'm trying to save so they didnt allow me to pay for my ticket. My step dad was nice enough to pay it for me. I told my GF that this was the plan for NYE. She already wasnt happy by the fact that she had no other options in order to see me because I was doing this with family as I am very family oriented and have always been with them for NYE. Anyways after a fuss GF agress to come.. a week or two later she starts saying that I am rude for not offering to pay some of her ticket as she is not financially stable herself ""also a side note, we go out to dinner/movies every week and she does not pay for a single thing I always do"" anyways I explained my situation and stuff and she then started saying that If I didnt help she couldn't come.. after my family had already purchased the tickets.. I then got given Christmas money from relatives and was going to use that to help her pay $70 why she paid $100. NYE eventually came and all was fine. I then had to give MY GFs money to my step dad to pay him back but he knew the $70 was mine and did not want to take it from me.. so essentially he payed for her ticket correct? I then told my GF about this today and asked her if she could just send him a text saying thank you but my GF then says this to me.. ""But I didn't ask him to pay for me so you should be saying thank you"" do you guys this this is right or is my GF rude? Also another side note my family had gone out to buy alcohol for themselves as well as my gf.. gf decided she wanted two extra cans so she went out and bought extra. The night before NYE she says to me that I should be paying less money for her ticket because she had to buy more drinks.. like wtf? 
Opinions please! 

TLDR: Girlfriend acts selfish and is inconsiderate. "

6,"My mom is mad at me, I'm mad at her and I'm not sure if I was the asshole of the situation


My mom has lymphoma and had an appointment today from 10am until about 4pm today for starting up chemo infusions today. She needed someone to drive her both ways because she wasn't sure how she'd feel afterwards so I got my shift today covered and planned on taking her.

I was quiet this morning when I got to her house because I was 90% sure my ex bf (who I'd been with for just over a year, he broke up with me the second week of November) had a new gf and I was bummed about it. She asked if I was ok and I just said yeah because I didn't wanna bother her with my stuff on a stressful/all around emotional day for her. All of a sudden she decides she's fine to drive herself to and from. I knew she was upset with me but just kind of let her go.

Not long after she leaves I see an Instagram post from my ex and he definitely has a new gf and she's pretty and perfect looking and they look happy and it just crushes me. I text her explaining why I was quiet and how I was really upset at the moment and she sends back that I should consider her side of things. I tell her again that I'm upset and I would've appreciated just a little sympathy for a moment. She responds that today should've been all about her and to leave her alone.

Hours later she texts me that my brother and I need to drive 40mins to the hospital to get her car, drive it back to her house, and then I need to come get her when her infusion is done. I respond that she told me she'd be fine if I didn't take her and she just says she'll ask someone else. I found out later from my brother that she just waited until she was feeling better and then drove herself home. 

Was I wrong? And if I'm not, how do I make things right without ""backing down"" and just apologizing to shut her up?

TL;DR I took the day off to do my mom a favor, she says she doesn't need it because she gets mad at me over something small, gets more mad at me because I needed my mom to pay attention to me for a little bit over something upsetting, and then changes her mind and reneeds the favor.

7,"My dad (49M) has always been very generous to me and I (21F) feel guilty because of that


**TL;DR**  My dad has always given me money and bought me stuff and now that I'm an adult I feel guilty because of it because I was a spoiled brat when I was a child.

My dad is a very good and generous man. I've known him like this since I was born. We're a middle-class family and in terms of parental love and material things, I've always had it very good. But now whenever he gives me money or buys me something I feel really guilty.

I was kind of bratty when I was a child and acted pretty ungrateful in a sense that I lost things often, didn't know how to spend money wisely etc ... But when I came into my teenage years completely changed and started realising how thankful I should be for everything that he gave me and hell, for having parents who loved me unconditionally and made me feel safe. I think my mental issues also play a significant role in me feeling like a piece of shit every time he gives me rent money. I'm a university student and my scholarship and work money are not enough, because I can only work on weekends since being in school, studying and doing side projects takes up my whole day. I really do try to be as financially independent as I can, though. I never ask him for anything if it's not absolutely necessary. I've always liked to treat my parents too and saved up to buy them nice presents for their birthdays and Christmas, just because with every year passing I'm appreciating them more and more. I want them to know that I'm glad if I can make them smile with little things, too, although they are not very happy if I spend a lot of money on their gifts.

The guilt of how I was as a child is eating me up and although I know my dad is not holding any grudges against me, it's me who is holding them against myself. Today he gave me a bizzare amount of money and told me to buy myself what I needed. I politely rejected it but he insisted. I'm not going to spend it for stupid shit though, I'm putting it on the side.

I talked about this to my boyfriend too. He said that I had to leave how I was as a kid in my past because I was a good person now. And that I couldn't compare my financial status with my dad's and that if he didn't want or didn't have the money he wouldn't have given me it. Also, that he was my dad and he decided to have me so I shouldn't feel like I owe him and that ma dad was very well aware of how much I appreciate him because I show him that a lot, and that he would be hurt if he knew I felt that way. But I feel like I owe him everything because I see how some people can't even afford bread and how many of my friends' WEALHTY parents don't give a shit if they don't have rent money. I just can't take that for granted.

Are my feelings rational or am I exaggerating? Does anyone else feel the same? Please help me out with this, my head is going to explode."
8,"My [28f] ex fiancé [35f] says she still loves me after leaving me for someone else


I met my fiancé back in March 2018. It was a whirlwind romance, love at first sight. We fell hard and fast for each other, I had feelings for her I’ve never felt before and it truly felt like she was my soul mate, that we were meant to spend our lives together. Everything seemed so perfect. 

We got engaged only 3 months after dating. I had never been so sure about anything in my entire life. In September, I started a 6 month program at the university and I worked evenings on top of that so I was gone for long stretches of the day almost everyday. She had an injury and hadn’t been able to work all summer and it was really starting to affect her. I did my best to give her all of my attention when I got home. I would write her sappy love notes while I was at work or school and she was at home. I tried romantic candle lit dinners, concert tickets, date nights etc. I knew she was feeling depressed and I did everything I could to try and make her feel loved. 

One day, without warning, she called me at work and said she needed a break to work on herself. I was devastated but I did my best to understand and support her. A few days later she broke off the engagement. I was baffled and couldn’t help but think there was something else going on. 

A few days later, I finally got it out of her that she had fallen for a friend of hers (someone I had my suspicions about anyway). That destroyed me. She kept saying she was still in love with me but was also in love with this other girl now and she didn’t know what to do. For the past 2 months she’s been seeing both me and this girl and says she can’t make a choice with who she wants to be with. 

I tried to just say “screw it” and let her go but when I do she goes on about how much she loves and cares for me and how I always promised her that I’d be there for her and how she’s hurting too etc. etc. I told her that the choice should be easy, I was her fiancé and she only just met this girl. Am I wrong for thinking that? Sometimes I think this has all gone too far with this other girl and that my ex and I will never get back what we had. It kills me that she still sees her while she is seeing me at this point. I feel like a fool, maybe I’m in too deep and can’t see that I should have let go a long time ago. I need advice. "

Hi all,

My coworker J who is a coordinator is leaving in about 2 weeks. I was offered her position but it would be a demotion and long deadlines and overtime which is the main reason I rejected it. Today coworker S who is an analyst asked me a specialist how long it takes me to do my work. I told her about a week for a report. She goes on to say I'm going to ask boss about the replacement. And if they havent found anyone yet I'm going to ask if you can take over in the meantime. I dont do any of the work J does. S and J work together. I work alone and basically dont relate to their work. So in my mind it doesnt make sense for me to take over the work temporarily. I said doesnt the supervisor usually take over? S replied shes definitely been in situations where she has had to cover. This isnt the first time S has asked me to do some of her work. How do I deal with this situation? I'm pretty pissed off but dont know how to deal. I feel like I'm unfairly being targeted by S because she stays late daily and I do not so in her mind I dont have as much work as her. I do not always finish my work but I choose to leave at 5 anyway. And my workload is not as heavy or deadline oriented.

Help please.

Thanks.

Tldr: coworker is pushing someone else's work onto me so that she wont have to do it. "

12,"Anon feels lonely when a beautiful girl is in sight


If you plan on reading this, thank you so very much. 

As you could have guessed, I'm anon and I'm single. I created a new alias here on reddit because I want to ask anonymously if people know how to patch this following issue in my system. The problem I'm having is the one in the title, and every time I try to find an answer from the internet, all I get is ""work on your self esteem"" or ""meet people,"" yet I don't feel like my self esteem is lower than appropriate and I also go out more than once a week with relatively close friends (I say relatively because I moved to the US a bit more than a year ago) that usually introduce me to more people every now and then. 

Fellow reader, I don't find myself unattractive or lacking in confidence. Every day I feel lonely, as in ""I want a partner"" lonely, but I can't seem to find how to fix this. I'm now going to do my best in listing the things I've done that I thought would make me fix this situation:

- Swipe with a 50/50 ratio on Tinder about 3h a week and have a decent set of pics and bio. Results: about 2 matches per month that I find interesting. Talk to them and they either give me single word sentences, unmatch without answering, or I just find during the chat that their personality is toxic or boring... So no dates from there, just numbers and social media. 

- Basically the same thing but on Bumble which is another dating app.

- Get to know people in the classes I take at university and even keep contact with the most significant ones. Results: Have met awesome friends (mostly females) from doing so, but the few that I found interesting, have either been already in a relationship, just out of one, stopped answering my texts, have declined my lunch invitation, or just show toxic or boring traits (probably the only traits I try to avoid I kinda sorta guess).

- I will occasionally spark a random convo with a stranger that seems open in public. Results: Only once the conversation actually took a turn where she appeared to be very clear in wanting to have lunch with me (we were both alone at a food place). That time, after I had lunch, I went to her table and asked if she wanted to have a desert with me (I had it in my hand). She declined saying that she had to go soon, yet she was still eating, having food on her plate, and when I was walking back to my seat she told me ""that would've been nice."" Disclaimer: I'm not mad nor think she was obligated to have the desert with me in any way, I just find it weird that her first and last signals were so positive, but the actual response of her to my invitation was not.

- Whenever the signs are positive, I will gently flirt with girls. No clear results.

- I keep a (usually) clean look and am a fan of fashion so I (usually) dress quite alright. Results: Outfit compliments, most of 'em sparking a small talk that ends up in nothing. 

I honestly don't currently remember any other thing that I do that I think influences my single status significantly, so now I'm going to point out some things about me without making it obvious who I am:

- 18/ M/ Hispanic - Italian/ short clean hair and beard cut/ 5'9/ about 14% body fat/ one or two pimples lmao/ little latino accent.

- Deeply in love with music. I make it too, and have played at numerous 4k+ people festivals in my home country in the past.

- Outgoing, try to keep a balance between making people around me laugh and giving others a chance to do so too. 

- I eat healthy and drink very little, although I don't find it easy to get me drunk; I think (due to my personal experiences) people born here may have a smaller tolerance to alcohol in some way compared to South Americans.

- I have been involved in three relationships in my life: One ended because of distance and my arrogance, and I ended the other two due to heavy toxicity (one was sexist and unloyal, the other one had psychological problems due to her thyroid and wow, impressively manipulative; Made me lose a couple friends I wish I still had). Last relationship ended a year and a month ago, and lasted ten months. 

- I'm proud of being able to say most people qualify me as ""very smart,"" and have gotten the same amount of comments like ""I honestly don't know why you're single"" and ""at some point you'll find the one.""

- Currently find someone specifically interesting in my circle of friends from my home country that are here in South Florida. I'm not sure how to approach this because she apparently just got out of a relationship, but I will do my best to engage in action in the right way. I just have to do some more research.

- Extremely grateful of the fact that my life pushed me to do all my school years with the same group of people, so I have good friendships that started when I was about 5 and still go on. Also want to add that I curiously have more girl friends than guy friends. Not only more in quantity but in quality.

- I'm not stubborn about my mistakes, although I once was. Some of the bad things about me that I want to fix are: I don't usually read books, just read lots on the internet. I probably am too fast in bed, but I'm not sure lol. I may or may not give a desperate vibe, but I think I don't do so, so this one is ambiguous/ I've never gotten someone to tell me I look desperate tho. My room is a hot mess that I've been trying to fix ever since I moved here. Sometimes I forget I accepted to help someone do something unless they remind me. I also feel like too many people ask me favors. 

Am I being too friendly and not conveying the right message to girls? Am I being too desperate? Do I even speak English? Is 18 just too young to expect having any relationship other than friendship? Is it weird that I want to just wake up and have someone by my side? Do I even exist? Am I expecting too much of others? Is mayonnaise an instrument? Am I not kissing enough ass? How does anything in any way work? These are questions I don't know the answer to. 

Once again, thank you so much if you read all this. I will do my best to answer comments, questions, anything, I want to be helped. 

Tl;dr: Me feels physical pain whenever I remember I'm single, me wants your help in not being single. "

We had been together for 6 months. We had been planning this trip for 2 months. I \[36f\] had flown in to NYC (my first time there) to see him \[38m\]. He was going to drive in from out of state.

I knew that this relationship was nearing an end and expected us to have one last night of fun before it ended amicably. At 6:30 pm, he texted me to tell me to check my email. There were lots of excuses, but essentially, he said he wasn't coming and this was over. This was my first time in NYC. I sat crying at a bar in Times Square, on New Years Eve, on my birthday, after flying across the country to see him.

17,"I (21M) am having trouble getting my girlfriend (19F) to sit down and talk to me, and it's driving me insane.


First post here! Hope I did the proper flair and all that. Also, sorry for the huge text block. I maybe went a bit too into detail.

&amp;#x200B;

A little backstory. Me and this girl, let's call her C, have been dating for about three weeks at this point. Things have been pretty good. Our personalities bounce off each other well, and our humor is very similar. Prior to dating we spent a ton of time together, seeing each other everyday after work, hell I even slept over there most nights. There was even a bit of grab-ass going on, nothing too serious, just like slapping each other on the butt, or because she knows it drives me up the wall, while we were walking around in public, she'd bend over in front of me when I wasn't paying attention. It embarrasses me a bit, but all in good fun.

&amp;#x200B;

One day we started dating. We still sleep together almost every night (I mean actually sleeping), and see each other about everyday. However, the little games of grab-ass have become incredibly infrequent  It doesn't bother me, I just thought it might be worth noting, I dunno.

&amp;#x200B;

My last relationship, well it didn't end well. I was with a girl for about 4 years (basically all throughout high school.), and she skipped school one day (this was two days after prom) and said she was sick. A few days later she tells me that she lied, and that actually went out and slept with another guy. We decided to try and work things out, and were together for about a year after that. She left me when she went off to college, saying she didn't have time for both a relationship and college. I was, well, upset to say the least. 

&amp;#x200B;

It took me a bit to get over, but after about 3 years, I finally put myself back out into the world, and that's when I met C. After hanging out for a few weeks, she basically asked me when I was going to ask her out. A few days later, I took her out on a nice date, dinner, beach, small amusement park, and asked her out. She said yes.

&amp;#x200B;

Anyways, to the main point. A few days ago, I woke up with really bad anxiety. I had work, and I couldn't particularly blow that off because rent money is important, so I reluctantly went. The day went on, but I never really got better. After I got home, I spent some time with C. It was nice, we just kinda hung out. Later on, she went out some friends. I didn't get a chance to introduce myself because well, C didn't want me to at the moment. Fine, whatever, it is what it is. 

&amp;#x200B;

This is where I feel like I personally messed up. C hanging out with all these people I didn't know made my anxiety spike up. I thought after a 3 year break, getting cheated on wouldn't have left such a bad mark, but man it's definitely left something there. Queue me, having awful invasive thoughts. I told C, and she called me. I told her what was up and she seemed to get mad at me, thinking I was suggesting she'd go out and do anything awful. I wasn't trying to imply that, I trust her entirely. But there's always an invasive thought that pops up. I'm not trying to think about this stuff, it just happens, but I think I failed to get that across. 

&amp;#x200B;

Later on in the night, she said she'd stop by to grab some stuff, and I was like oh cool, I'll introduce myself to your friend. C said okay, but she didn't want her friend to know we were dating, said she'd explain later. Alright, fine whatever, I have somethings I want to talk about as well, so we both agreed to talk later. I wanted to actually why I was like I was all day. 

&amp;#x200B;

Alright, fast forward to the next day, she gets over at about 2 in the afternoon. Is absolutely blazed out of her mind. Eats some food and goes to sleep. Fine, I'll just try to talk after she wakes up. Wakes up at about 8, I bring up talking and she's like oh we'll do it later. Okay, fine. We go out dinner, spend sometime cleaning the house and then go to bed. 

&amp;#x200B;

Next day, New Years Eve, I'm excited. I start putting plans together. I go out and buy flowers, I plan for us to go out to the beach and watch the fireworks, and I was gonna try and do the cliche romantic midnight new years kiss. I was content. But then C's job holds her all the way until about 12:30 AM. Upsetting, but fine, nothing to sweat. She comes home at about 1 in the morning with her friend, and her friends dog that we said we'd watch. I am at this point, incredibly drunk. C grabs some stuff for work and leaves. For the whole night. So I have been left in charge of HER friends dog while she goes out to have fun. Not cool. I message her and tell her that I think it's kinda messed up she did that, but I don't get anything back. 

&amp;#x200B;

Next morning (yesterday), she stops by to grab some stuff for work, hugs me, we chat for a bit, and she goes to work. Doesn't bring up the previous nights events. Message her and tell her I'd like to talk tonight once she gets off work. Fast forward to about 10 at night, she's off work, and we're hanging out. I feel like I finally have a chance to tell her how I feel about everything. So I start, and I get some of it off my chest, but eventually all I get back is ""I just want to relax."" At this point I just kinda got up and went for a walk. I was a bit frustrated.

&amp;#x200B;

This morning, I bring it back up, that i'd like to finish our conversation from the last night. ""Oh, I don't really think we need to talk."" And then she goes off to work. How do I get her to sit down and listen to my grievances? Am I in the wrong for wanting to talk? 

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR: Trying to talk to my girlfriend for the past few days, but can't seem to get her to sit down and listen. Don't know what to do, or if I'm in the wrong on this one."
18,"I (23F) am having doubts about my sexuality and don’t know how to deal with it while being engaged to my fiancé (23M)


We have been together for 6 years. I am terrified that I don’t actually like men. I do find him romantically and sexually satisfying, I think, but I have only ever kissed or dated him, so I’m not sure how I’m supposed to know. 

He’s the only person I’ve told about my doubts. I told him what I know: that I like him, and I like women, but I have never found another men sexually or romantically attractive. I know I’ve not dated around so it’s harder to know, but I don’t feel the same things with men as I do with women.

Boundaries have been super unclear about experimenting with my sexuality in the relationship. He told me with some girls that I can experiment, with a specific friend that I should explore a romantic or sexual relationship, but also got angry when I had a brief semi-sexual moment with another female friend. 

I am torn because I love him and want him to be happy, and I want to continue a partnership with him. And I’m happy mostly. There are just times when I feel this weight crushing me, and I don’t know if it’s anxiety over our relationship being doomed because of my sexuality or anxiety about not understanding my sexuality. 

How am I supposed to deal with with this as a partner when I am not sure how to cope as an individual? Should I go to counseling? How do we work on making clearer boundaries? The only way I can see boundaries being solidified is if we made it clear that I should only be sexual with him, but when I think about a life filled with this much personal uncertainty, I’m not sure how we can have a successful relationship.

TLDR: I don’t know if I’m gay or bisexual, yet I’m in a committed relationship with a man. I love him and want to build a life together, but I’m not sure how to move forward with the anxiety surrounding my sexuality."
19,"Can I [20s F] tell him the truth?


I'm in my 20s and I've been through a few relationships in my time. I would say I get easily attached to people who are really nice to me, but relationships can make me anxious in the long term. That's nothing that I've ever been afraid of telling anyone, in fact I make it quite clear when I enter a new relationship, I usually take things slowly. My problem has never been entering relationships, but rather with ending them. 
I've never had a breakup where a man has ever accepted my reason behind it. I try to save his feelings, I'll mention that we're drifting apart, or that I'm too busy, or they deserve better than I can give them, etc. But so many men have told me that those reasons arent good enough, or that they never hurt me or cheated on me and that I should be willing to put up with the other stuff.
Specifically, is it wise when a man wont take ""it's not you, its me"" for an answer to say: ""sorry. But you look at other women too much"" or ""you have bad breath"" or ""you talk too much"" or the like? Is it in my best interest to spare their feelings or to give it to them straight?

Tl;dr: men dont agree with my reasons for breaking up when I'm trying to spare their feelings"
20,"Some guy on my Snapchat and FB blocked me. This is what happens when you don’t focus on your personality and can’t talk to the opposite gender.


I have to get this out there because it’s just crazy how some people feel so bothered when it’s from their own actions and lack of personality. This guy has been on my Snapchat/FB since I think like 2015. We only talked via Facebook/Snapchat before I eventually started dating my current boyfriend in 2016, but I kept him on my social media and never wrote to him nor cared to. I have 1,000 friends on Facebook, just to drive a point.

Randomly like a year ago he started sending me stupid pictures of himself at his job,his drink on a Sunday afternoon. Just dumb random stuff and either I didn’t respond back to him or I’d write casual non flirty responses to him. My boyfriend and I broke up for a bit (he was on tinder and bumble talking to other people, too) and I finally wrote something back to the guy on my Snapchat but more flirty and he wrote something back to me. The conversations never went anywhere because either half the time he never responded, sent dead end responses, or instead he sent me stupid ass pictures of his face or the conversation went dead. He legit couldn’t talk to me for crap. ZERO social skills. I even gave him my number wondering what’d he do and instead of saying “Thanks I’ll text ya”. He’d say something dumb almost like “Oooh yeah?” and then instead of texting me, he’d just send a dumb Snapchat of his face, his dog or write “hey”. So I got bored and stopped responding or just humored him. My boyfriend and I eventually got back together later on, and so obviously I stopped writing to this guy.

I wrote Happy New Years to tons of people, him included and he of course never responded back. And then today I got a “Oh hi” and again another picture of his face. I wrote nothing back and didn’t think about it. I go on Snapchat and he blocked me on that and Facebook. Is that supposed to hurt my feelings? He couldn’t even have a normal conversation with me and didn’t want my number even when I was single. It’s a shame that someone who is pretty good-looking could be so unremarkable and have no personality/social skills. Not saying you should be awesome because you’re cute, but you need more than a nice face to keep someone’s attention. I find it hilarious. Took this guy an entire year (because I didn’t really ever talk to him for a long time) to realize that his attempts of sending me pictures of his face and dumb shit was going nowhere. Don’t be like this guy. I don’t even care, I just needed to giggle and rant about this.

**TL;DR** : Guy I met who I’ve been friends with on social media for the last 3 years finally blocked me when I started ignoring him after trying to make normal conversation with him and eventually gave up. This is what happens when you don’t put work into your personality."
21,"My [22M] girlfriend [21F] lost interest in sex...says it's her mental state.


For the first 4 months of the relationship it was awesome. I'm fresh outta school living in NYC and she's finishing up school in Boston. I’d visit her every other weekend, and she’d do the same, she even came to NYC to spend her birthday with me. Loads of sex (her sex drive is higher than mine) and couplely stuff. My friends and family love her, and her friends and family feel the same about me. My friends even said that this is the first girl i've dated that isn't a dumpster fire.

(Note: We were boning two years ago when she was back in Jersey but we were never dating or anything. Just close friends that got along really well that would bone. We had a falling out the summer of 2017 where I was entering my last year of school and I sorta just let it fade. Basically I ghosted her for a few days and it just built up. She came to a NYE show that my band played last year because she wanted to see me, but we didn't talk much... it was really awkward. We then reconnected last May while I was seeing someone and we became friends again. We didn’t do anything sexual until a few months later after i was single.)

ANYWAY. fast forward to now. I know my girlfriend has clinical depression/anxiety and body dysmorphia. her mother died when she was younger and she's also adopted. She is a sensitive bean but also works her fucking ass off. she's basically self sufficient. I’ve tried to make her feel more loved then ever (sent roses to her work, sent chocolates, surprised her with a custom printed card, took her out to a beautiful dinner for her birthday, we cosplayed together, she sung a song with my band, we recorded a cover together, I paid for a small 2 day vacation). 

she just told me her depression and anxiety has been worse than every before. She said it’s been really bad for the last 3 months. We still embrace and adore each other and it feels really natural, but her crazy sex drive has dropped to almost nothing. I just find it strange considering we’d spend 12+ hours straight boning earlier in the fall. 

I tried to ask about it a few times and she said she’s uncomfortable talking about it and that I need to understand that this is her first relationship and she wants to keep somethings to herself. She hasn't had a good history of partners in the past so i sorta feel where she's coming from.  I’m 99% sure she hasn’t cheated on me, I know she loves me (she said it first after we'd been seeing each other for 7 months) and I know she has mental issues. How can I get her to talk about what’s bothering her without pushing. She's never been in a relationship before so i understand her tendency to bottle things up.  


I really love this woman and I just don't want to see her in pain. I know I can't fix everything but I want to be somewhat in the loop. I've suggested SSRIs and she's been receptive. 

She has assured me she is more than happy in the relationship and I believe her, but if she has problems, I’d like it if she didn’t bottle them up because she’s in a relationship and that’ll inevitably effect our relationship...

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR: girlfriend of 5 months lost her sex drive completely, everything else seems normal (happily spent new years and Christmas together) Says it’s her depression/anxiety/body dysmorphia. How can I get her to open up to me without pushing?"
22,"Not my relationship, but a dear friend's (F50, M50)


My friend (F50) split with her husband 2 years ago. He left her for a woman he'd been having an affair with for 8 yrs. 

She recently met a guy on tinder, maybe 10 weeks ago. Fell head over heels. To cut it short, he's playing her. They go out and she pays. Have a night in? She buys the wine. 

He doesn't answer her messages or calls sometimes. Says he's busy or he's tired. 

After a while I saw he was back on tinder. I told her, she got upset, she confronted him and he made some lame ass excuse and she forgave him. Since then he has failed to get her a birthday card, Christmas present etc, even though she bought him stuff. He freeloaded off her over Christmas, got free food and drinks. 

So, today I've seen he's back on tinder again. After deleting his profile in front of her. 

So, how do I tell her, AGAIN, without her hating me. I swear to god she thinks the sun shines out of his ass. God I want to shake some sense into her... Sorry for the long rant. I'm pissed off.

I should add he texted her this morning saying his bank account was overdrawn. It's only a matter of time before he starts hitting her up for cash.

TL;DR my friend, who I have known for 30 years is being totally naive. How do I tell her?"
23,"Advice for couple (22F, 25M) where one person does all the driving?


I am looking for advice and suggestions for helping out the partner that does all the driving in the relationship. I have been with my partner for 1.5 years and I do not have my license yet but I am aiming to get it before this April. I have major driving anxiety and it's taken me a long time to try to overcome the fear so I can be more independent and help out my boyfriend with driving. He does all the driving and gets frustrated and feels like he's being taken for granted at times and I want to find ways to show my gratitude (besides just saying thank you). I offered to pay for gas and parking in the past and we just decided now that I'd help with paying gas but I wanted to know if anyone else has been in a similar situation and what they did to help the partner out. (He doesn't have his advanced license yet so he can't legally help me practice driving and I can't legally drive in his place). He hasn't been able to come up with other ways to help out since it's something that can't be changed over night (since I have to practice a lot before doing the road test and whatnot). I try to show my gratitude in different ways but haven't been able to think of other ways to show it that would ease the burden of driving directly.

24,"I (31F) got into a fight with my mom (65F) because she thinks I should be more aloof to my boyfriend.


My mother and I got into a fight today because she was asking me about how my new bf is (29M) and I was saying how great he is etc. and she started saying ""don't get too possessive and clingy with him."" and it set me off.  
My mother subscribes to the belief that you have to make men ""work for it"" and you can't give them too much attention and you have to pretend to be mysterious in order to keep them chasing after you.  Actually most of the women in my family do. I think this is complete bullshit. Maybe playing this game will keep a guy who is shallow and only want what he cant have's interest but I don't want to be with a guy who needs this in order to be with me. 

I am very open, loving and affectionate to my boyfriend, we see each other most days/nights. I have had boyfriends in the past who weren't as good to me and made me feel really insecure.  

My mom has always liked to point out all of my flaws (even made-up ones) I try to brush it off because I know that is just how she is but sometimes she gets to me.  I feel guilty about hanging up on her when we were on the phone though.  I told her that she offended me and that my relationship is none of her business and that she should be telling me how lucky he is to be with me.

Now I am second guessing myself because my BF spent the last 2 nights at my house and he was saying that he needed some time to get some work done this week. I kind feel bad sometimes that he is with me at my house all the time and not doing all the things he would normally do. But we just started dating so I feel like that's pretty normal. 

I am actively trying to make plans with my other friends for the next couple of days and get some things done without him too so that we don't get burnt out on each other, but then my mother had to go and say that and now I am feeling super insecure. I don't what to do now to feel better.  I've tried talking to her about how she makes me feel and she just responds by insulting me over and over again.

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR My mother thinks I should play hard to get with my boyfriend, I think it's bullshit but now I am feeling insecure. I am upset at her for saying that to me and I don't know how to get her to stop.  Now I am second guessing myself and thinking that I am too possessive and clingy.

25,"[[UPDATE]] My boyfriend [32M] struggles with rejection and communication, I [30F] am at my wits end.


[Original Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/9zwvaq/my_boyfriend_32m_struggles_with_rejection_and/)

Original Post tl;dr:  My boyfriend only seems to be able to express his feelings when we are fighting, and often the fights come about as a result of him suppressing his feelings out of fear or rejection. I'm worried about the future of our relationship, because while our relationship is otherwise great, communication and honesty are super important to me. 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

My first post didn't get a whole lot of attention, but some really interesting points were brought up that I thought might help others in a similar situation:

&amp;#x200B;

\-My boyfriend being from an Asian culture my have had more impact on our relationship than I previously thought. A user brought up the idea of ""Ask Culture vs. Guess Culture"" which hit the nail on the head in a lot of ways.

&amp;#x200B;

\-Another user brought up the idea of ""showing the answer vs. showing the math."" I feel like a lot of times he just tells me the end result of something or that he was upset after a long time, and I told him it's important for me to understand why things happen or what he was upset by, not just the end result after everything (ie. we had a situation where he was upset about ordering pizza, when it turns out the online ordering system causes him anxiety and I was only seeing the ""end result"" of that anxiety).

&amp;#x200B;

\-We had a long talk about how we view things and how it's really necessary for him to take the time to tell me his thoughts and feelings, and we decided dinner time is the best time for him to sit down and talk to me. Of course, a lot of these things will take much more time as well as trial and error, but we're already having issues crop up again and I'm worried about the future.

&amp;#x200B;

CURRENT SITUATION:

After we had our discussion it seemed like we were on the right track with things. Now I'm staying with  his family for the holidays and we had the same issue crop up, and again I'm feeling frustrated and confused.

&amp;#x200B;

I caught a bit of a cold from a few days ago, and after resting up yesterday I told him that I really want to get out of the house and do something, but as long as it wasn't mostly outside (for fear of my cold getting worse again). I was feeling a lot better than the day before (back to 75% from about 30% energy the day before). While I said that I'd prefer to go out,  I also said I'd be happy to spend the day in if that's what he'd rather do and asked what he'd like to do. He said he'd like to go somewhere, but we looked around and it doesn't seem there are many options indoors that we could do (we tend to do more outdoorsy activities when visiting his hometown). We spent part of the morning searching but after a time it seemed like we'd just stay in for the day.

&amp;#x200B;

Around the early afternoon his sister called him  (from across the house). On the phone I heard him say to her, ""(OP) isn't feeling well and doesn't want to go out, so we're just going to stay in and rest today."" When I asked what the call was about, he said his sister and mom wanted to go to the mall a few towns over and invited us to go. I asked him why he said what he did (about me being too sick to go) and he said that we had already decided to stay in for the day, so he said that.

&amp;#x200B;

I was really upset by this for various reasons 1.) I had already told him multiple times that day I was feeling much better and wanted to get out of the house, pending it was somewhere indoors (you know, like a mall...) 2.) rather than asking me if I wanted to go he assumed I wouldn't 3.) we've had various instances like this where he assumes what is the best/right for me, and in most cases it's the opposite of what I want or would choose to do.

&amp;#x200B;

This turned into an argument between us. Since this situation has happened multiple times (him assuming things and making choices for me without even asking me) I was really upset that it was happening again and nothing seems to have changed between us. I told him that it feels like he doesn't respect or trust me enough to make those decisions for myself, and it hurts even more that the decisions he makes for me are generally wrong. He told me that when he's sick he thinks it's better to stay in, and it was true that I was sick. I told him what he told his sister technically wasn't true and it's my decision in the end if I'm going to do something when  I'm sick or not. I told him if I was too sick to do something I would have said that.

&amp;#x200B;

For some reason during this conversation he brought up that the day before yesterday he felt like I was judging him and rejecting him. When I asked what he meant, he said that when the four of us went a few towns over we were planning to grab lunch and then go strawberry picking. I fell asleep in the car and when I woke up he asked me what I thought about getting Thai for lunch. Considering the fact that we had both had stomach aches the night before, that Thai place has spicy &amp; oily food, and we were going to all-you-can-eat-strawberry picking, I said it probably wasn't a good idea and we should get something light instead. We ended up going to a cafe, having a good time, and enjoying strawberry picking. But he told me the fact that I rejected his idea of Thai made him feel judged and rejected. I felt even more frustrated because he asked me what I thought about Thai, then I told him.

&amp;#x200B;

I don't understand how I can tell him how I feel about things without it possibly bringing up feelings of rejection for him (especially when he asks me my opinion directly, and I answer him honestly). I even asked him, ""How should I have reacted when you asked me that, to not hurt your feelings?"" He thought for a while and said that instead of saying no so harshly, I should have just gently suggested going somewhere else. I don't know how I'm supposed to know that in the moment, though, or know what's going to hurt his feelings until after the fact (also I didn't feel like I said it so harshly, I said something along the lines of ""Thai is spicy and heavy, I think if we're going to go strawberry picking we should eat something small and light, right?). Up until he told me today, I thought we had just had a totally normal conversation and compromised on something everyone was happy with, but apparently not so in his eyes.

&amp;#x200B;

So this is another messy and long post, but I just feel like starting off the first day of the year like this was not how the day should have gone. I feel like things should be more simple than they are, but his way of thinking internally and not sharing complicates things, and I'm very, very tired of it.

&amp;#x200B;

My questions are:

&amp;#x200B;

\-I'm I being an asshole in this situation today? Something about the phone call situation triggered me back into other similar situations we've had and it just seems like he still has no grasp on why it's so upsetting for me to have him making choices for me, especially when I feel like I'm being clear about what I want or would do (ie. I wanted to get out of the house and go somewhere, saying I didn't want to go to the mall, or in a previous case not telling me that his grandma was hospitalized and that he wanted to go visit her even though if he had told me I would have 100% wanted to go with him).

&amp;#x200B;

\-How can I prevent him from feeling rejected or judged? In a case like the other day, I felt like we had communicated well and understood each other, but it turns out he still doesn't really feel that way. I only find this out after the fact, and I'm not sure what else I could possibly do to make things better.

&amp;#x200B;

\-How long does one usually wait to see their partner making changes? I am trying to be patient, but these issues have been going on for a year, almost a year and a half now, and they still happen pretty consistently (every two months or so).  We keep having these ruined days or ruined weekends and I find myself fearing when the next one will be, simply because I haven't actually seen any progress in these situations."

We have been together the past 4 months. I find it so hars to do the things I used to enjoy and it seems the only thing that makes me happy is her. Now I know this is a problem because we both obviously need space, but for some reason I think she doesn't want me when she asks for space and I'm miserable on my own. How can I fox this? How can I get back to enjoying time with myself and friends? I dont know why I am this way, but do any of you have advice? Thanks, I greatly appreciate it.  


Back story: she has left me before and has ensured she's not leaving again(long story, wasn't because of me) and I feel so insecure when she wants space. That she might leave again.

28,"I (16M) might have gotten friend-zoned by the girl I've had feelings for a few months.


This all started in April, we started talking over snapchat, it's important to understand that at the time I was very overweight, weighing at 215 at 6'0. This girl is very, very, very beautiful, model material. We talked and talked and at the time I didn't realize that she was dropping hints, all the sudden in early May, she just ghosted me. I then thought that I couldn't get with her at my weight, so I lost around 50 pounds, I went down to 165 and am now at 175 as a result from going to the gym for a while. 

&amp;#x200B;

On New Years Eve, I had a paragraph typed out ready to send to her, it said, ""I know that we don't talk at all and that you don't really know me. It's been so hard holding this in for a while now, I have feelings for you.. everytime I see you I just, I don't know, you're so unexplainably beautiful. I know we don't know eachother but I would love to get to know you. Even if you don't like me back it's fine. It feels so good to get this off my chest, I'd rather get rejected than not know at all. Also I'd like to say thank you because you motivated me to lose weight and get fit.""

&amp;#x200B;

Now before I sent this, you had nooo idea how nervous I was, I had to have my friend send it, for some reason, it didn't send on New Years Eve, so I sent it the next day at the gym. 

&amp;#x200B;

It took her an hour to respond, and this is what she said: ""Thank you for the compliments. I would like to get to know you as a friend if that's okay. I hope you understand. btw you don't need to lose weight for a girl to appreciate you.""

I replied with, ""No I understand that's fine.""

29,"My [M27] wife [F26] and I didn’t tell anybody about our marriage and my MIL [F50s] is furious.


My wife and I have been together for about five years and married now for less than a month. We’re both fairly reclusive and keep to ourselves, but we’re incredibly happy with each other. 

She was never a fan of grand gestures, lots of anxiety involved, so everything sort of happened under everybodys’ radar. Everybody knew when we got engaged because of social media, despite those updates were weeks late, but we told everybody we didn’t have a date set in stone—and that was the truth.

In November last year, still engaged, we knew we wanted to be married but we never wanted it to be a huge ordeal. We found out some thing that would be really useful for us if we were to marry before the end of the year, so we did early December. Had a lady from the courthouse come to our quiet apartment and marry us in front of our Christmas tree and we had a fancy dinner later that day.

My wife was so happy. 

We wanted to have a celebration of our marriage with our families, so among us since we’re incredibly busy and days off together don’t line up usually and decided to tell our parents the news.

My parents were incredibly supportive and understanding. They want to meet us somewhere for dinner and maybe some bowling after. Her mother, however, is furious that we never told her and that she was told so late. 

So, now my wife is in a spiral of guilt because of it. She tried to get her mother on board over text with the dinner and all but it was becoming overly difficult to get her to come and when my wife told her what is about, she absolutely lost it and has been guilt tripping her ever since.

So, what can we do to make this right? I told my wife to hell her that ‘ we’re sorry, we never wanted this to be a big ordeal but we wanted to spend some time with everybody, what can we do to make it right? ‘ but we’ve been met with silence.

**tl:dr we told nobody about our recent marriage, and while trying to have a family get together weeks after, mother-in-law is furious and guilt tripping over it. What can we do to mend this?**"
30,"My [26m] girlfriend [26f] expects me to ask her parents for permission to propose, and it's causing problems


The title pretty much sums up everything. My girlfriend and I were recently discussing the future and marriage, we're both very on board with the idea of it. However, she made it clear that she'd ""need"" me to ask her parents for permission before proposing. I'm entirely uncomfortable with that, and I told her it wouldn't be happening. This upset her and she started saying if I wouldn't ask them then obviously it doesn't mean much to me and I'm not serious about it.

I countered by essentially saying that I felt the exact opposite, that she's an adult and I don't need anyones permission to ask my partner to marry me, that if she cannot say yes on her own then it's indicative of her not being ready for marriage and that I wouldn't feel comfortable entering into a marriage by giving my in-laws that sort of power over my relationship as it sets a bad precedent.

I get along with her parents well enough, but regardless of how well we got along I think asking them permission to marry their daughter is an outdated concept that implies they have authority over her romantic life. I'm asking her to marry me, not them. I told her I'd be willing to talk to them, let them know our future plans and include them in that way but would stop short of asking for permission, but apparently that isn't good enough.

This whole thing is starting to change the way I looked at marriage with her and quite honestly her maturity level as a partner. We both come from the same culture/background so it isn't even a cultural difference. How do we bridge this gap? I understand parental approval is nice, but am I crazy for thinking at the end of the day you need to be comfortable saying yes on your own and the approval of others is secondary?

TL;DR Girlfriend and I cannot agree on the importance of parental approval regarding marriage proposals."
31,"I don’t have a lot of experience In relationships and I think I missed the window to have some important discussions


I [26F] have been in a relationship with my boyfriend [28M] for about six months. My history with sex and dating is that I never pursued a monogamous relationship in my early 20’s, choosing to rather focus on educational and career goals. I did pursue physical relationships and was very fulfilled by that. As I achieved my personal goals, in the last two years or so I’ve been seeking a serious committed relationship. I couldn’t seem to get out of my rut of a friends with benefits situation, as the sexual aspect dominated over an emotional connection. I decided to consciously prioritize the emotional connection with a guy before getting physical. 

That brings us to my boyfriend, we dated for about a month before having sex. We spent a lot of our time together going on fantastic dates and he never pressured me to get physical. When it finally happened, things were very passionate, but there was definitely room for growth. I figured the sex would get better over time as we learned more about each other. The problem is, it hasn’t. We do the same thing every time, there is no foreplay, and what really bothers me is that I feel like I am the only one initiating it. I don’t know if he is trying to be gentlemanly, but it makes me feel undesirable. 

I wish we had talked about our pasts and our sexual desires earlier in the relationship. I just don’t know how to bring it up now. I’m not afraid of finding out something about his past or my past, I really just wanted to focus on “us” in this relationship so I never brought it up. 

I REALLY like this guy and he checks all the other boxes. I’ve never felt so emotionally supported, so comfortable around someone before. We share a lot of the same interests and we both enjoy learning new things. The only thing missing is the physical intimacy. I am afraid he thinks everything is fine since I’ve not said something before, I want to have the chance to talk about it, I just don’t know how to start. 

What is the best way to bring up spicing things up in the bedroom? How can I communicate that the sex isn’t really doing it for me without offending or embarrassing him? 

TL;DR my boyfriend and I never discussed our sexual desires early on in the relationship and now I don’t know how to tell him I need more. "

For some background, my parents are extremely hardworking. I respect them a TON for it; they’ve done so much and come so far to be who they are. I am in my senior year of high school and also go to college a few days a week. I have a 3.9GPA in high school and 3.5 in college.  I’m going to be a doctor. I have a job. 

I also am slightly mentally ill. I have had problems with depression and continuously struggle with anxiety. I don’t work long shifts or anything but my mental health can deteriorate when I work *a lot* and it starts to make me physically ill. I’ve been working almost every day for two weeks on little sleep while studying for school. This morning, I woke up achy and exhausted and didn’t go into work, which I felt SUPER guilty for. I hate having to call off but in this state I would’ve been more of a burden than a good worker. 

I talked about this at dinner today, how I needed a mental health day and was just exhausted from working so much while studying. Aaaand that’s where shit hit the fan. My parents openly laughed at me saying that I have no idea what hard work is because “your dad works 12 hours, sometimes 18” and “I’ve worked 36 hours in three days before!!” 

I get it. I know they work hard. I always tell them that they do and I’m proud of them. But they never seem to acknowledge the stress of high school, college, work, and mental illness on me. They always laugh at me when I complain and I just don’t know how to ask them to stop when they’re the type that laugh at people on TV for crying. 

It makes me feel so worthless. 

TL;DR my parents are hard workers and laugh at me for complaining that I’m stressed and exhausted even though I’m doing a lot in my life too. Just not as much as them. "
34,"My GF hates that I'm friends with a guy a slept with once when drunk a decade ago and I feel its hypocritical


TL;DR: 9-10 years ago I slept with a guy friend. We're still friends but never again have we done anything. GF of 10 months gets upset. Says she doesn't want me to cutoff friendship but it's basically implied. Yet shes only separated from her husband they arent even divorced yet and she wanted to remain friends with him and wanted me to get to know him which I was awkward about but ok with. But she never made me do it.

Nearly everything else about our relationship is perfect. It's just that...

My gf (34F) and I (28F) have been dating for almost a year now and we're pretty open with each other. I have no issue telling her everything and neither does she. Especially when we first started messing around cuz it was just easy to talk. 

Years ago (around 10 I think) i got trashed at a party and slept with a guy friend (now about 28) from high school. It was a mistake and never happened again. We stayed friends and years later I realised I was gay after a few other fails, he's got 2 babies now it's whatever.

At the time we weren't officially dating I mentioned him once cuz he texted me a joke idr what it was but I remember describing it to her. I never mentioned he and I had slept together because he was back in my home city (Cincinnati) I'm now in Norfolk Va for work, we rarely talked (maybe a hey, here or there or send a meme once a month) it honestly just never occurred to me to bring him up like that. 

Fast fwd 6 months into our relationship I move back to Cincinnati to finish school. He had borrowed a guitar from me the entire 2 years I was gone. He asked to buy it but I know he's short on cash and my mom needs help (she's rehabbing her home and is on dialysis) so I asked for labor and he agreed. 

My gf seemed suspicious of the fact that he was coming over. It's our 1st couple months being LD so bad combo. I assured her nothing is going on it's just paying off the guitar and he genuinely wants to help cuz my mom is ill. I realised we had a history and idr how it was brought up but I told her that he and I had that thing a while back cuz openness n shit and it went downhill from there. 

She's upset that I never told her about him at all up n til I'm back home in the same city as him, which I explained that I did mention him before but it never occurred to me to go that deep. She also doesn't understand how we can remain friends after that. She never stayed friends with ppl she did anything with because she considers it disrespectful to any SO she may have in the future. I honestly never looked that far ahead or cared to, shes my first real relationship so I'm learning as I go here. I felt I was clear and open that there's nothing to worry about on both our ends. 

She says she doesn't want me to end a friendship but she brings up how she has no friends she's slept with (it's not like I have a bunch its 1 dude). She says how everyone she knows would find it disrespectful while I also know people who dont think something that old and dry with barely any contact is that big of a deal. I'm just trying to find unbiased opinions now. 

Once she went to back home to NY and found out an ex was gonna be at a mutual friend's party she told me he was an ex and that she would say hi. I didn't care I'm cool with it. The guy had his gf there and he said nothing to her not even a hi and she's upset by this so this is the perfect time to say she wished someone would put her first like that and not be around past ppl. We weren't even on the topic at the time she just brought it up. And I didn't care for her comparing our relationship to others she doesn't know the exact reasoning behind his reaction so we fought about it. 

Everytime my friend is even hinted at she gets noticeably pissed off and basically gets short with everything. She calls him names, asks if we're talking all the time, and basically sends me thru a police investigation. I once sent her a screen shot of my phone to look at something funny and the FB messenger bubble of him was up. He messaged once about a fight (I'm part of an MMA gym). She saw the screen shot of his FB bubble and asked why I was sending her his bitch face. I've gotten over the name calling cuz i know that's just how she talks, it's how angry she reacts no matter what. 

This was nearly 10 years ago. She's technically still married and wanted to remain friends with her ex husband when we first started dating. I was cool with it. I knew it was complex and I wasnt gonna push. I was wary about meeting him, she never pushed me, but that was in our early dating stages and that just felt weird. She cut it off cuz she thought I was uncomfortable which I respected but told her that was unnecessary. I said I wasnt going to split a friendship, I wouldn't expect that from her. I never met him I've only heard about him

She rarely talks to him unless necessary and when she does she tells me. She jokes and speaks freely about him. I normally wouldn't care

My issue is I feel that's a bit hypocritical. Someone I was with once over a decade ago is completely unacceptable, but a marriage of several years that ended just before we started dating is supposed to be ok? Shit her mom just sent her a letter and used his last name instead of her maiden name, her mom knows we're dating and she never actually took his last name. Again 1st thought none of this bothered me but I think about how she would react if it was reversed and I get irritated.

I feel like I cant talk about my friend at all, she gets extremely mad. If he comments on a FB post of mine (i.e. ""you're gay?"" A common joke she admitted she wouldn't care if anyone else said it) she becomes reclusive for hours.

I made a mistake once and lied sayin the guy who she just noticed commented on my FB post wasn't him (he uses a dif FB name). I didnt plan it I just saw the inevitable fight thats already happened multiple times and wanted to avoid it. It was a mistake, it's not an excuse I know I was dumb for it and I apologized knowing it didnt help. That was a bad fight. Now it's worse lol

I've always hated those ppl who dumped years worth of good, not toxic friendship for a relationship, I refuse to be that person. I'm trying to understand am I being a dick for thinking she's being a bit hypocritical? Am I not being understanding because of what I think its hypocrisy. I feel like I would see her side more if I was upset about her ex husband but I'm not.

I'm so confused. I feel all I can do is reassure her and that's what she even tells me to do but she still gets so damn mad..."
35,"How do i (28F) stop being an inconsiderate bitch to my husband (32M) and help him heal from the pain i caused?


About a month ago I caused a huge rift in my marriage. we've only been married six months (dated for four years prior). In a nutshell, I got drunk at the weekly ""social hour"" (free beer) my company puts on, went to a pub with coworkers after the keg ran out, and basically stopped communicating with my husband after around 7:30 or so (when we left for the pub, which I informed him of). I didn't answer my phone again until 11:30 or so, by which point I was totally drunk and also knew I was in trouble for being so inconsiderate. I rolled home around 12:30-1:00AM. To top it off, this was after an important day at work for him and he was looking forward to talking to me about his day. Poof, no wife, wife is sloshed with coworkers. It is the worst thing I have ever done.

Why did I do it? Even a month later I truly cannot explain, justify, or even really remember why I behaved like that. Even though my drinking lately has tipped into ""problematic"" territory, I have never disappeared on a drunken spree like that before. I attended my first AA meeting last week and have started reading the ""big book"" as well as many other pamphlets and resources. It is something I am taking very seriously. I have not had a single drink all December, not even a drop at Christmas, but I know that is just step one of a long journey toward total sobriety, which I have come to believe may be necessary for me.

He grew up with an alcoholic father that he is no longer in contact with, so I not only hurt his feelings in the moment, but I also picked open the scabs of some very old wounds, which have been causing him pain all this past month. We started seeing a counselor and have seen him twice before holiday stuff interrupted the therapy schedule. The therapy is helping (he suggested it first but I was so relieved he suggested it). But it doesn't feel like enough.

Although alcohol is one part of the picture, it is not the only reason he is so upset. He is mainly upset because of my lack of consideration for his feelings, and in particular for prioritizing myself, and others, before him and his feelings. To be honest this is not the first time I have hurt his feelings by not considering them -- this is just the first time it has happened with alcohol involved.

Even though I have been trying to be more sensitive to him and his feelings, I have still managed to fuck up twice in the past seven days alone by being inconsiderate again. The first was when we were attending a high pressure Christmas party and I came home ""late"" (we had a misunderstanding about the timing/plans, but it's true that I missed his call and was also out Christmas shopping when the safest/best thing to do would have simply been to stay at home and wait out the day). The second was just today, when my MIL and I watched a few episodes of a show (without him) that he really wanted to watch with us. So I'm hurting his feelings all over again, and still I cannot explain why I would do this. Why I am not managing to take care of him when I know he is so vulnerable right now.

I truly don't know what is wrong with me that I keep making the worst possible decision, even when I know he is so sensitive right now. I hope the psychologist we are seeing can shed some light, I feel like perhaps I may be a narcissist since my behavior fits that pattern. I am dealing with the alcohol thing but it's just not enough.

I truly love my husband and I cannot reconcile my behavior with my feelings toward him. In truth he is the most important person in my life, yet in my actions I deprioritise him and make him feel so unimportant. I take full responsibility for my actions. We plan to keep going to therapy and I want to do everything I can to make amends and repair our relationship.

Most importantly, I would like some advice for how to take care of him when A) he is resurfacing a lot of past trauma, B) his trust for me is very low, C) many of his family members have treated him with disrespect and basically emotionally shit on him and made him feel like the least valuable person in the room, and this is yet another case of the same pattern.

Sorry this is so long. I feel like a convict asking for advice on how to make amends for my crimes. I just want to understand how I can best take care of my husband. I know I need to work on my consideration skills, how do I put this into practice every day? I know I need to make him feel important. How do I reach out when he (reasonably) feels so cynical, suspicious, and untrusting of my numerous (and failed) attempts to act differently?

Thanks to anyone who can offer some insight or thoughts.

tl;dr my inconsiderate behavior (drunkenly disappearing until late at night, among smaller things) had caused a lot of distrust and pain for my husband. I want to make amends but don't know how."
36,"BF (27M) of 2 years has perfect family and I (24F) still feel awkward and insecure around them


My boyfriend of two years (27/M) is Indian and his family is very close. I (24/F) am mixed but am often mistaken as Indian. My family is also not normal (bipolar and alcoholic dad, parents divorced, aunts and uncles on dad’s side hate each other, not close with mom’s side of family) He always invites me to his family events with all his aunts, uncles, and cousins, and I truly feel awkward and out of place. Not only am I a cultural outcast, but also I don’t know how to act around a normal family. He assures me that everyone likes me, but I just feel like that’s not true. I feel like they wish I were Indian even though he is fine with me. I can never fully relax or be myself around his family because I constantly feel judged. I try to listen and not talk much and if people ask me questions about myself I try to answer quickly and change the subject. I am always exhausted after these events and being an introvert doesn’t help. 

I can’t imagine feeling like I’d ever belong if we were to get married. I would be embarrassed if his family knew how dysfunctional my family is, and there is no way I’d want a wedding. I also feel like I cannot completely open up to him because he just doesn’t understand the effects a toxic childhood has on a person. He will never completely understand me and that does kind of bother me even though he is always supportive of me getting the help I need.

I know I need to go back to therapy, but if it has already been two years should I give up on trying to feel accepted? Should we break up for his sake so he can find a better girl who is also Indian? I’m not sure how to talk about how I feel. I don’t want him to think I dislike his family. I just don’t know how to be around them. 

tldr: BF (27/M) has perfect Indian family. Mine (24/F) is dysfunctional and mixed. I constantly feel like an outcast around his family and don’t know how to approach the issue or if it’s even fixable after 2 years."
37,"I (18F) am becoming mentally broken from my family's situation


My grandmother (78F) from my dad's (55M) side is an awful person. Both of my parents doesn't have a job and my dad cannot stand up for himself and his family. My grandmother is doing well on the business/work field and all my dad does is stick with her and ask her for money. We just newly moved here in the US, long story short, my dad since me and my sister (20F) were younger he stopped working in his 40's and started depending on his mom since then.

My grandmother is the worst of the worst grandmother's out there. She's prideful, she wants to be superior than everyone, and because she has the money, and supports our family atm, whenever she says bad things, insults to our family, all my parents can do is just stay quiet. And it hurts me that this is just how things are gonna be until our family find jobs.

She one time sat us all down in her kitchen to scold us all saying that we don't care for her. And she started yelling saying very hurtful stuff towards everyone. She even mentioned that maybe I'm stupid because I did not finish highschool and she also said that she dislikes me and ""doesn't know why"" while my parents were there just being silent. I'm currently trying to get my GED done prior to moving just less than 3 months I'm already down to one subject. Anyways, there has been many incidences where she has been like that. She doesn't like any of her grand daughters (including me) that likes makeup, or is anything doing normal grooming beauty things. 
She always stabs people behind their backs saying negative things. 
And a recent one is we had a gathering for new years at her place, and my 15/16F year old cousin had a not so good history with her since she has bad experiences with her before. My cousin was silently sitting with my other cousins and when my cousin's mom left to get something, my grandma told her to ""stop acting so pretty"" and ended up making my cousin cry on the way to their car when we all said goodbyes. And these stuff happens to me too, causing me to distance myself from her. 
When my grandfather passed few years ago, my same 15/16F cousin and her dad visited the funeral and she went to them and yelled that she doesn't wanna see their faces and told them to go home. Even though they didn't do anything. She dislikes 2 of my cousin's because she feels like she wants to control or have power over everyone's lives and because they're not praising her or becoming her small minions always making her feel special.

My parents even argues often because of my grandmother's behavior and my dad doesn't wanna leave his mom because no one else is there to take care of her but him and us having no choice and to deal with her personality. My father sometimes has the same attitude, yelling at my mom (41F) disrespectfully and it makes me mad and I end up defending my mom and everything just becomes a whole mess.

My main problem is that my grandma can be this awful and my parents are just accepting it because they don't have jobs, and me and my sister has to experience these things with them. Even my aunt's asked my dad ""how can you stay with her? How?"" Because all of my dad's siblings knows what type of person their mom is and we have to suffer too.

I feel jealous of other people having sweet grandparents that always smiles whenever their grand children visits. All my other close grandparents passed away already due to old age and sickness. So to some of you who has nice grandparents there's someone like me wishing to have one as well.

I'm not really asking for anything, I'm here just to let my problems out. But any comments or opinions on my situation will be appreciated. Excuse my English since I am not a native English speaker.

TL:dr: I have an awful grandmother that has control of our lives because she's the one supporting our family. I don't know how to keep myself together with these things happening. "

Been with my boyfriend for a few months, everything is great apart from our communications online.

Basically, if I don't text/call him, we just wouldn't talk that day. He very rarely messages me first and I'm finding it a bit frustrating (because we have a great connection irl, it just somehow doesn't translate into texting/calling)

I don't want to seem needy/clingy, so there are times when I don't text him for days on end until I can't stand it anymore.

How do I make him understand that keeping in contact on text/calls is important to me and I want him to do it first more often?

41,"My (24/F) boyfriend (22/M) has emotionally cheated on me more than once.


We've been together for about 9 months. He used to be an addict (Xanax), and is now battling alcohol addiction. He has a history of depression. Anyway, about 2 months in, I saw a message from a female pop up on his phone one morning. I asked who it was and to open to conversation.  The night before, he was at home and got what he calls ""black-out drunk"" and messaged some girl on Facebook asking her to come have sex with him. The day after (while we was in my bed), he had apologized to her and said he was drunk, and also included that if he ""was single, he'd have sex with her every day of the week"". I was disgusted reading this, especially because he had said that while he was in my bed! I broke up with him immediately. He begged and begged for another chance, so I gave it to him.

&amp;#x200B;

Fast forward to 6 months in, he left his laptop open at my house while he was at work. I heard his Facebook messenger going off like CRAZY, so I couldn't help myself but to check it out. He was messaging a girl that he knew from rehab a few years ago. He was saying things like ""I'm thinking about you non-stop"" and ""I know I'm in a committed relationship, but I really want to be with you"" and he even asked if she'd be cool about meeting up one day! They were literally messaging each other lovey-dovey messages his entire shift and I sat there and watched the whole thing. He had the nerve to text me in the middle of it things like ""I miss you babe!"" Ugh. Gross. I broke up with him when he got home. A few days later i stupidly gave him another chance.  His excuse was that he feels so insecure with me and he wanted a ""back up plan"" because he knows I'm ""too good for him"" and that I'm eventually going to realize that and leave him. WTF?

&amp;#x200B;

About a week ago, I found out that he had taken the number of a customer that comes in to his work (he's a cashier). I'm just so fed up. He is SO GOOD to me besides these things that he's done. He cooks for me, he compliments me, he brings me to family events, etc. I'm his first girlfriend. I've become crazy insecure because of how untrustworthy and unloyal he's been in the past. I have asked to go through his phone and social media recently, and noticed that he searches for TONS of local girls that he went to school with on Instagram and Facebook. He yells at me and tells me I'm being crazy, controlling and insecure. But I feel as though he has the mind of a cheater. He truly is my best friend, but I feel like i'm not good enough for him.. like he's constantly looking for another woman. One day, at the supermarket, a woman in yoga pants walked by and he turned his whole body around to stare at her ass, right in front of me! I'm just so tired of this. I really don't know what to do. Any advice is appreciated."

43,"My mom (41f) and abusive ex (30m) want me (22m) to settle down with him because no one will love me otherwise


God I don't know where to start with this, I guess with a backstory, I was homeless for the last 3ish years because my parents kicked me out for dating another guy, I came to San Francisco and just lost contact with my family because why would I want to deal with them? While I was homeless I would often sleep with people to get a meal, a place to sleep, and a shower. It wasn't glamorous and really sucked and a few times I was really tempted to cross my boundaries (drugs, already open drinks, condom usage etc) but I never did, until about 2 years ago I met George. I'm using his real name because I know he's not on Reddit, but George has a nice job in finance, George owns a house in San Francisco (where houses are like crazy expensive), George has a very strong addiction to meth, and George was incredibly abusive to myself and other young guys. When I met him he seemed so nice, we hung out and he just spent time getting to know me, he bought me a Kindle and a ton of ebooks on Amazon for the things I like to read, he always made sure I had food and it was good. Somehow I effectively ended up living there, he gave me a code to get into his front door and I could leave my belongings and go as I pleased. 


We were together for maybe 6-9 months depending on how you look at it and during those months he would wake me up by hitting me because I was snoring or too restless, sometimes during sex he wouldn't be ""clean enough"" (with butt stuff you do occasionally expect to get shit on your dick and it's usually no big deal, you just keep going if it's not a lot or if it is you should just pause and restart) and would beat me for getting shit on the sheets even though it was his and we used his bad sheets, he drugged me at least twice that I know of so I would ""be more calm"" at night, he would take what ever money I had and said it was to pay for the food I ate (probably fair, but I was homeless and really needed cash in hand), he would take vacations for a week or two at a time and not tell me so my things would be locked in his house and I couldn't get them. Twice I tried to leave and he called the police saying I was mentally unfit to be alone and they would just bring me back to him.


Anyways you get the picture, George was a dick. Last night I unfortunately locked myself out of my place, the office of my building is usually open 24 hours but because of the holidays there's no staff between 10pm-4am, I got off work at 10 went home and realized my mistake, I called my friends but they were out of town for the holidays, I called some co-workers but they didn't answer. It was 10 at night and all I had was some gloves a beanie a T shirt and some athletic pants, I was cold and didn't know what to do. At 11:45 I called George, and to my surprise he picked up and said I could come and crash there tonight. I walked the 20 minutes to his place and we talked and laughed for an hour or so, I told him about school and work and how I have my own place and I'm really getting my life together. I actually forgot for a moment how he used to treat me. But after an hour of hanging out he told me to go shower because he wanted to fuck, I told him I'd shower because I'm sweaty and gross after working for 8 hours, but I wasn't going to have sex with him. He started telling me how useless I am and how my life is nothing important and that I was just made to fuck him and it was my only purpose in life. So I showered and we did the nasty and went to sleep. He woke me up twice by slapping me because I was snoring and woke me up at 7 and he was on the phone with my mom.


My mom is something else really, imagine the bitchiest southerner woman who's also extremely well educated (2 Masters in education and early childhood development)- with that background I'm surprised she's such a shitty mom. Anyway, she's on the phone talking to George and he's handing it to me after I've been awake for all of 30 seconds. I forgot what her voice was like, I forgot how she talked so smooth but with so much venom in her words. She told me she's been talking to George for a month now to help me get my life together and her new years resolution was to get her family back together and George had the means to take care of me and blah blah blah, she basically wanted me to be his housewife because we all have to have that heteronormative life where the man takes care of everything. I told her how he treated me and how I can't actually depend on him for things and it's just by happenstance that I was there last night and he he wasn't good. Her response was basically I'm making it all up because I'm crazy and not right in the head. Then when I got off the phone with her George punched me in the eye because it's not true what I said about him and he's a good man and I can't do any better. I tried to leave and he called the police saying I'm suicidal, which sucks because I actually have a history of that  and I'm pretty sure the police are looking for me and I just wanted to sleep in a warm place. Now I just want to cry, and no one believes me about George because he's 5'3"" and I'm 6'5"" and how could I let anyone that small beat someone my size. I'm home now and my phone is blowing up, I called into work to take a sick day and I really just want to curl up in a ball and disappear. My mom has my phone number now and she can contact me whenever and I'm actually terrified that they'll let George into my building and he'll come beat me for leaving him like that. I just want to cry. I even know is building a life I want is worth it when there's people from my last who just want me as some object, whether it be my mother as a member of her family to keep it whole despite the loveless relationship or George who just wants a bug younger guy for his use.

47,"I [f30] was threatened by my boyfriend’s [m33] brother [m34]. He works for my stepdad, how do I avoid him?


My boyfriend [m33] and I [f30] have been on shaky ground ever since he cheated on me in March. We’d been together for a year as of December 1st. We’d been having ups and downs lately because I found out he was Facebook searching his ex, the one he cheated with. He also unblocked her number and didn’t give me a good reason why. However, I did believe that he was just curious and tried letting it go. 

&amp;nbsp;

So later we go to a friend’s house, a friend of my boyfriend (“Richard”) and his brother (let’s call him “John”). John mentioned something about Richards ex, the one he cheated with. I should’ve just let it go but I got angry and said I didn’t want her name spoken because Richard had just been Facebook stalking her earlier that day. I walked away and was getting ready to leave. I didn’t want to ruin everyone’s good time. 

&amp;nbsp;

Suddenly, out of nowhere, as I’m leaving, John gets in my face and screams that I’m a stupid prissy cunt and how I’m entitled and he’s just full on screaming at me. Prior to this we had been drinking and everything was fine. He screamed about how hard his brother was trying with me, how much he “tried” to like me, and then he said “if you get in my way, I’ll fucking plow you over,” and at that point one of his friends had to physically restrain him as he was an inch from my face, screaming. He had screamed some other things as well. I simply told him my situation was none of his business and that he was white trash. During all this, my boyfriend Richard did not stand up for me, he simply walked out the door. 

&amp;npsb;

I go back to Richards house right down the street and I walk in his house and start gathering my things. Richard keeps telling me to get out or he’d call the cops. I told him I wasn’t waiting in my car as I had been drinking and I wasn’t going to get a DUI. It was cold out and I calmly told him I was waiting for my parents to arrive. I had called them and they were coming to pick me up. I told him he was free to call the police and I could describe the situation but that I wasn’t waiting outside in the cold. This might’ve been a mistake on my part, since I suppose he could claim trespassing, but my parents were a half hour away and I didn’t want to freeze on the porch. I also didn’t trust him to gather all my stuff up. During the time I’m waiting for my parents, Richard continues his brother’s tirade, telling me how much I suck and I told him calmly it’s fine, things are over between us and they have been for awhile. 

&amp;nbsp;

My parents arrive and I leave calmly. I told my parents what had happened, and I told my stepdad (who employs John as a mechanic at the flight school my stepdad owns) how terrified I was that this man was in my face screaming at me and that I felt physically threatened. I’m 5’2 and maybe 105 pounds. John is taller and much bigger. I don’t ask my stepdad to fire him but I do want him to talk to him about his actions. My stepdad seems torn. I don’t think he’s going to do anything about the intimidation and I think my parents have been blaming me throughout this whole thing. They blame me for going back to Richard after he cheated and don’t understand that I truly cared about him, despite several red flags. 

&amp;nbsp;

I want to continue going to my stepdads flight school. I also take flight lessons but I’m scared of this man who has gotten up in other peoples faces before. He is well known for his anger, drunk or sober, and for his violence, and I know my stepdad has talked to him about talking to customers that way. It’s predominately male at the flight school and I’m afraid of the repercussions. I know both my now ex boyfriend (who also took lessons there until recently) and his brother John will continue to spread rumors about me and harass me. They have before and I’m afraid it will continue. I’m afraid my stepdad just refuses to see this and doesn’t want to piss off a good mechanic. There is also the fact that I’m afraid this man will “maintenance” one of the airplanes I fly and I might be hurt. I know this sounds crazy but this man is greatly unhinged and I wouldn’t put it past him to mess with one of the airplanes I fly. 

&amp;nbsp; 

TLDR: my now-ex boyfriend’s brother threatened me and got in my face and I felt physically threatened. He works for my stepdad and I’m afraid my stepdad isn’t taking the intimidation seriously enough. Despite this, I’d still like to continue my lessons at the flight school but I’m afraid of this person, both physically, and I’m afraid of the fall out from him spreading rumors and lies about me. I was hoping someday to flight instruct for this flight school and if that brother John is still there, I don’t feel comfortable. How should I proceed from here? Is this nothing to worry about or should I back off and forget about my dream of flying? Is it worth potential harm? "
48,"I (28F) just found out my boyfriend (29M) of 9 years has been secretly taking drugs for over a year.


Tl;dr boyfriend of 9 years has been taking ectasy for over a year and I just found out. 

My bf and I have a very open relationship, no passwords on phones or secrets. I was playing a game on his phone when our mutual friend sent him a message about hanging out for new year's. I was responding to the friend when I noticed the text above that was them taking about buying pills. I'm pretty sure white nikes are ecstasy. I scroll up. There are a lot of those kinds of messages sprinkled through their text. This friend had been getting them and mailing to him. I check his venmo and there are payments to this friend for over a year. 

I'm so confused. I don't know when he takes them but I think it must be sometimes when I work a weekend and he stays home. But this just clicks a lot of things into place for me. About 2 years ago my boyfriend and I have had a really hard time. He was sleeping more, being way more antisocial then usual. He is an introvert but he wouldn't want to see even his best friends. I almost broke it off after almost a full year of this hyper negative mood. I told him I was sure he was depressed and needed to actively try and get better. He seemed like he really started to once he realized he would loose me. 

But now I am wondering if that is when the pills started. Did he take them to improve his mood? We have taken ecstasy together at parties a few times over the years and I have not noticed any of the normal signs of use. I dont know if he is taking it in small amounts to act as an antidepressant possibly? 


What do I do with this? Has anyone else had a similar experience and can give me guidance.

49,"My [20M] girlfriend [20F] goes on Tinder to schedule dates with random guys then never shows up just to waste their time. Not sure what to think of this.


Yesterday I was using my girlfriend's phone to check directions for the new years party we are going to when I saw that she had the Tinder app installed. I asked her why she had it and she said she just uses it when she's bored and isn't actually seeing any guys.

I was skeptical and decided to see what she was doing and it was just guy after guy that she would talk to, tell them a place and time that she wanted to meet them and then she would never respond to them when they asked why she didn't show up.

I don't know what to think of this since she's not really cheating on me or anything but I still think it's immature to waste other guys times and lead them on for what seems like no reason. I asked her why she does this and she just says that she does it when she is ""bored"". Thoughts?

Tl;dr: girlfriend wastes people's time on Tinder by setting up dates and flaking on them.

50,"I (25M) feel stuck in my current relationship with my gf (29F) and want to experience single life but am afraid to leave her


First time poster but here goes nothing. Sorry for making it so long but I appreciate the input.

I've been with my gf for 1.5 years now and I'm starting to think I need some time to myself to be single and focus on me. A little background: I've only had one previous ltr for about 7 months and we did not have sex because of my religious reasons. That, combined with my career progression being pretty intense I don't feel like I've had much time in my life to enjoy being single and explore meeing other girls. Fast forward to later in the year after that relationship ended and I get in a relationship with my current gf. She is spontaneous, quirky, loves to go on adventures and has been loyal. I love what she brings out in me in some ways, she is a social butterfly. I'm much more grounded, procedural, introverted, and scheduled than she is. After a few months of dating she took my virginity and has been my only partner. She has had a few partners in the past only with guys she has been in a relationship with. We both have put A LOT of effort into our relationship and have gone on some fun vacations together and shared many significant moments together in our careers and lives.

But we fight a lot and have had our share of problems. I have a stable career and make a decent income for myself, and she is very supportive of it which I love. She however has been on a roller coaster ride, can't seem to get any traction and is always struggling to make ends meet. When I met her she was not in school, but she has recently gone back to school to get her degree (which I'm proud of her for). She has only had part time jobs since I've known her and got fired from two of them and quit one, which has been frustrating to me because her income keeps fluctuating unpredictably. She has lofty goals for her career, but seems to keep changing her mind on what she wants to do and can't seem to get going in one direction. Alwas seems to be looking out for that big break. She seems to intend to pursue 3 different careers that I don't think can be pursued simultaneously, and has been let down by opportunities in the past. It's frustrating to me to see this but I'm starting to wonder if it's worth it to keep being patient or if I'm being unrealistic. 

Her parents also pay her car payments and health insurance, and at 29 I feel like she should be able to handle that herself. Because of this, I've been (I think) overly generous in helping her with rent when she comes up short (we don't live together), I feel like I always pay for food and drinks when we go out, even buying some menial things like cat food and groceries for her when I know that's not my responsibility. We have talked about this and recently it has gotten better, but I'm unsure how long it will last. In addition, her spending habits sometimes baffle me. Frequently after she gets paid (not a lot) she will splurge on groceries at Whole Foods or buy some expensive (but imo unnecessary) skin care product or something. Then when she runs out of money I'm left to clean up the mess. And she makes me feel bad when I say no because she is just in a ""rough spot"", but she has been that way ever since I met her.

When we travel or go out together we usually have a great time and I do love how we can go explore together and have a good time with friends, but too often the night ends in us getting into a big fight. The last vacation we took together was about a week long and I felt like we fought 50% of the time. When we are home there are periods where it is fine and we get along, but there's also been numerous periods where we fight seemingly every day. It's exhausting and I feel like I'm walking on eggshells in fear of bringing something up to set her off. We have been going to counseling recently and I feel like it has helped marginally in some ways.

When we are around my family it's the weirdest dynamic I can imagine. She is so friendly most of the time but one little thing will make her mad and she won't say anything about it. Then at the end of the night she will blow up. Most recently we were at dinner with my parents and my mom made a joke we didn't realize hurt her feelings, she held on to it until the end of the night and went in the bathroom, got mad at me and stormed off home without even saying goodbye to my parents. I know my family can be quirky but she is consistently telling me everything wrong with them and how I need to change them, which is a silly proposition.

I feel like our sex life is great and healthy, but since she was my first partner I can't help but feel I need to get out and explore more. Meet new people. When I started dating her I felt like I was ready for marriage and to have only one partner, but now I don't think I feel that way anymore. I'm certainly not ready for marriage and I honestly don't see myself marrying her right now. I feel like the longer this goes on, the more things will stay the same. I've tried to break up with her about 4 times now, the last attempt lasting for about one day before we agreed to go to a Christmas party ""one last time"" and had one of our best weekends together. I know I'm not assertive enough when I need to be. Now I'm gone for work for a couple months and have some room to think about things, but the more I think about it the more I want to be single when I go back. Currently she is super happy and things are good, but I feel like it's only a matter of time before things blow up again. I'm also somewhat afraid of being lonely after we break up and not being able to find someone else as special and supportive as she is, but I don't feel like she is ""the one"".

tl/dr: GF is amazing in so many ways, but we fight frequently over finances, family, anything. As my first partner, I'm starting to feel like I want to be single again and explore and be myself for a while, but am afraid to leave.

52,"How best to navigate tense rooming situation between myself [25M], roomie one [29F], and couple roomies two and three [20M &amp; 20F] [queue]


Hey all, so going into this, I'd like to mention that I plan on leading a roommate meeting (I have experience with conflict resolutuon from college). What I'm looking for here is some advice on how to approach setting up the meeting, the meeting itself, etc. in as mature and efficient a way as possible.

&amp;#x200B;

**Context:** In September I moved into a new apartment in the city where I live (big city, you'd probably know it). I got in after a chance meetup with Roomie 1 (let's call her Margaret), who's a friend of my brother's and just moved here herself for school. Right away, I was a little leary about the age disparity between ourselves and the couple (let's call them Tyler and Jane, who are also students, albeit in undergrad), but rent was too good to pass up and the place was nice, so I overlooked that.

Going in, I didn't know any of these people all that well. Margaret I knew from a handful of hangouts in the past, but only enough to get the impression that she was a generally nice and funny person, and prior to signing the lease, I'd talked to her quite a bit about expectations as roommates (namely keeping the house clean, respecting one another re: noise levels, etc.).

&amp;#x200B;

**Situation:** So it quickly became apparent that both Tyler and Jane, both nice enough people are A.) understandably somewhat immature, B.) not used to living with roommates, and C.)  enabling one another's flawed behavior instead of lifting each other up.

Tyler is lazy. He's a typical college guy. Or he would be if he didn't frequently skip classes. He didn't even get out of bed to meet me when I first came by to look at the room. Jane is a ball of anxiety - sometimes she's scrubbing the floors, other times she's out cold in her room for hours at a time. They're messy. They leave food and dirty dishes behind and sometimes don't get to them for hours at a time.  Or the living room gets completely filled up with their stuff for hours at a time (I don't mind clutter, but when clutter isn't addressed for days on end, it gets a tad annoying). And like I said, they enable each other.  It's a toxic relationship, sort of passive aggressive. But that's their problem. I'm not their counselor.

Tyler doesn't have a lot of consideration for others. I don't think it's a malicious thing, just that he doesn't always think ahead. He's broken a number of cups and plates through sheer carelessness, and he's constantly dribbling his basketball in the house.

One major issue is in regards to houseguests. I tell everyone anytime I plan on having someone over, even if only for a little bit, just so they know that there's going to be a stranger in the house. Jane's told me that I don't have to do that, since it's my house too, but I kind of feel obligated. In November Tyler had his little brother stay with us. I thought it would only be a day or two, but it was half a week. More often than not, they were in the living room watching Netflix for hours at a time. Tyler's brother also did something to shatter our oven door, which we only just got replaced a few weeks ago. Not sure on the details of what happened there. Then in early December, Jane told us that she had some friends that would be coming to stay for a few nights because they didn't have anywhere else to go, and that they'd be here before break (as previously mentioned, all my roommates are students, and I'm an educator, so our breaks mostly overlap). And then we found out that Tyler was having people over too, so all in all there were 4 extra people staying at our apartment (2 of which we didn't know about until they were here) in about a 6-7 day period.

I wouldn't mind prolonged guests, but I feel like 4 is too much and it's least a courtesy to ask your roommates *before* you invite them.

I apologize for the lengthiness of this post, but there's one more factor at play here. I've discovered that Margaret is... very emotionally reactive. When she expresses emotion, she *really* expresses emotion. I don't like to use the word dramatic, but honestly, that's the best word for it. She gets *very* fired up about things, including our roommates. Margaret likes things neat, tidy, and clean as a whistle. And while I get that she gets pissed off about our roommates' messiness, and some of their other annoying habits, I hate how she shit-talks them to me behind their back, because it's creating this awful us vs. them mentality. I've addressed individual things to Tyler and Jane once or twice, and I know Margaret has too, I but don't think Margaret is good at keeping her anger out of her tone, so there's this tense dynamic where nobody talks about things like messiness and houseguests until there's a problem, and then when someone *does* attempt to address it, they get super defensive, and it turns into a spat.

&amp;#x200B;

**Onto the Now:** I want to hold a roommate meeting, as surprisingly, we haven't really had one of those. As far as figuring out logistics, that's it's own challenge, as I'm the only one in the house with a full-time job which also forces me to work some from home, so I only have about two or three free hours a night. I'm also naturally a solitary person--I like to be alone more often than most people, and I do have a tendency to hermit up in my room. I'm very patient, but I think sometimes that makes me a pushover, and I don't always know when I should be more fired up myself or when I can feel comfortable taking a more zen ""It doesn't matter"" stance.

How do I approach my roommates about having a meeting? How do I run the meeting without it turning into a back-and-forth argument about who did what and when and why? That's my biggest concern, that it'll just be everybody trying to air all their grievances at once. I also don't want to be patronizing, because right now I *feel* like the most mature person in the room, and I really just want us to be reasonably comfortable for the remaining months we'll be living together (Jane and Tyler will theoretically be moving out if and when their programs at school are finished).

Thanks for any and all advice you can give me, Reddit.

&amp;#x200B;

**tl;dr:** I want to hold a roommate meeting between myself, Roomie One, and the couple living with us regarding cleaning, houseguests, etc., but I'm worried it will devolve into an argument about everything everyone's annoyed about instead of being productive."
53,"Moving in together and marriage?


Hi so I'll be moving in with my partner next winter and by that time we will have been together for over 2.5 years. I consider it a huge step in the relationship and see it as building a life together and possibly moving towards marriage if all things go well. However, I'm anxious about bringing marriage up before moving out because I'm afraid he won't be as on board as I am. He's been bitter because of previous relationships and has mentioned not being fond of marriage very early in our relationship. I don't want to pressure him or anything but would bringing it up be a bad idea? I know on my end it won't be since that's what I hope to go towards but I'm just worried that the worst will happen. I know this is something I should be willing to talk about with him openly and honestly, especially when we're going to be moving in with one another, but I'm just scared of losing him because I love him very much but I also don't want to compromise things I want in the future either. I don't need to get married but it'd be nice to and it's always been one of the few traditional things I've been looking forward to when I'm older.  We've talked about our future together and I know that he really loves me but I want to know that he's as serious about this as I am.   


TLDR: Any advice for bringing up marriage and the future with partner? "

Hi guys,, long time lurker,first time poster. So my boyfriend and I have been living together for just over a year now. We've been dating year and a half. The last few months we have both been very busy with school and work and haven't been able to spend so much time together. It frustrates me but doesnt seem to bother him.

In all other aspects of our relationship, he is absolutely perfect. We are basically best friends.

So a few weeks ago, we had plans to spend the evening together and he texts me that he made plans with a mutual male friend of ours,, if I want to join. This hurt me very much and I told him so. 

We fought a little. We both apologized and moved on. Last night we again made plans to spend the evening together, alone. He texted me this afternoon that he was going out with this same friend, I can go along if I wanted to. This hurts me that he cancels our plans like this. He makes me feel like his friends are more important than me. How can I make him see that i am hurt without it turning into a fight?

57,"Facebook Behavior after getting engaged: Do and dont do


  Hello, I would like to hear your opinions and dos/don'ts on Facebook after getting engaged. Here is my situation: I started a long distance relationship with a lady. We became very close pretty fast. So after months of dating we became engaged. We've been back and forth to see each other but sometimes months go by without seeing each other in person. We do chat daily and do video calls at least 2, 3 times a week. Now, I've always been very private about my personal life, but I decided to publish on Facebook that we got engaged because to be honest I was a little jealous about some of the comments left and made by her on Facebook and I feel that in general people respect woman and men more if they see that they're engaged. Now, I don't want to appear overly jealous but I do love her and I feel jealousy is normal. The question is where to draw the line to no be over jealous. I noticed she has several photos of her and some of her ex-boyfriends hugging, kissing on trips ect. I find myself with trust issues after I see these photos because some of these guys are local to her current city and I am not there. I do trust her, otherwise I would not have proposed, but I also feel those photos are inappropriate and should be takes down. My profile is clean of photos of ex's and I feel hers should be too. I dont want to appear over controlling or over jealous but I thought about suggesting to her that she should make those photos private or delete them. I also thought about talking to her on commenting on other single men posts since some of her comments could be misinterpreted even though she is only being friendly. I saw a study once that says that 80% of men misinterpret friendliness with flirting and I believe it because I see it every day with my friends. I need help guys/ladies! Thanks in advance.

tl;dr - Do people typically fall in love at different speeds? Contrary to what culture would have us believe?

&amp;#x200B;

I'm about 5 months into a relationship with a woman after getting divorced about a year ago. Things are going well overall, albeit slow since my girlfriend is finishing up a Doctorate and it limits how much we can see each other during the week (1-2 twice max).

We enjoy each other's company and the sex is good, but it does appear as if there's a bit of unevenness in the love/affection we feel for each other right now. I'm further along in my feelings for her and she still needs more time to get to know me before she's ""ga-ga"" (we've had honest talks about this).

From the female perspective, Is the idea of people falling in love at the exact same time less common than movies and tv would have us believe? Should I check myself and slow down to my partner's pace to avoid getting hurt? She has rushed into relationships before so part of me hopes that she is purposely going slower, but it's hard not to feel insecure that after 5 months she's still deciding if she and I are a match. Women, have you fallen in love later than people you started with relationships with?"
59,"I May have broken a potential GF trust. Do I tell?


I (21m) have been seeing a (20f) gal for the past few months. We went to high school together years back and never really talked until recently. We live about 700 miles apart and have seen each other frequently during that time. Because of my job it is hard for me to get time off to go see her so we usually alternate paying for her to travel to see me. 

A few weeks ago I asked her to be my girlfriend and she said no. Well, she said “the answer is yes, but not right now.” And I was okay with it, until she told me she was 100% ready for an official relationship. When she told me that I took a step back and asked myself if I really was ready to make things official. And in my own messed up way I went out and had sex with another woman to test if it was something i would enjoy. The woman was super smart and attractive but I felt nothing. She was aware of the growing relationship i have with the other woman. I stopped it half way and decided that I was in fact insane about this other gal. I feel terrible and I can’t think of a thing more i want than her. I could use some advice on how and if I should tell her since we aren’t official. I have learned my lesson and I know that there isn’t a single strand of doubt in my body now that i want her. I know the trust will be broken and I know she’ll probably leave me and that scares me to the point of not knowing if I should say something about it. 

We planned on me visiting her a few weeks after New Years and I don’t know if I should tell her before or when i get there.

60,"Married in secret, need to get out, emotionally incapable and just don’t know what to do


I have a lot on my chest here, and there are a few threads of context that are relevant to conveying the situation - apologies for how long this is, I’ll keep is as succinct as I can. 

I met my current SO on vacation. I was in a very very toxic relationship with someone else at the time: my ex was manipulative and emotionally (occasionally physically) abusive. I was on vacation with a friend (planned before I met my ex). My ex wasn’t happy I’d gone, but my friend and I had paid a lot of money for it so I went. The last thing he’d suggested to me before I went was that he was going to end his life (not for the first time). So, I spent 2 weeks in a foreign country at my wits end and he wouldn’t pick up the phone to tell me he was ok. The ex did it to punish me, I know now he had no intention of harming himself, he knew I would be stressing and that’s what he wanted. We had been together about a year and it was pretty much all terrible and I was a nervous wreck.

So I met my current SO on one of the last days of that vacation, at my absolute lowest point, and did something I’d never ever done before: got blind drunk to stop the anxiety pains in my chest, and slept with a stranger (now SO).

The thing is that this sparked something in me and gave me the strength to finally ditch my ex. He had made my life hell for a year, and finally this stranger in a county far away wanting me gave me enough self-worth to remove myself from the situation. I know how pathetic this sounds, I just totally lost myself with my ex and this jolted me somehow.

Now, a sensible person would’ve taken some time to reflect on things at this point and re-build some self confidence by being alone for a while. I’m an independent woman with my own home and a decent job who has supported herself since graduating - I was never financially reliant on a partner. 

This is where I guess the fact I was still emotionally dependent became apparent. I pursued a long distance relationship with my SO for a couple of years, ultimately marrying him in secret. Initially, we tried to get a visa for him to visit my country (I told myself there was no harm, it’s just a visit), but that took so long, and I kept visiting him in the meantime, then it was denied, and I’d gotten more attached, and it got to the point where marriage was the only way to be together. 

This whole time, my closest friends had effortlessly met the loves of their lives, gotten engaged, married, some had children. I think all of this pushed me forward in a relationship I knew wasn’t right, so I wouldn’t be left behind. 

So here I am, we live together in my county, 5 years after we met. He’s no angel but is generally a really good guy, treats me well, but just isn’t the one. The anxiety pains in my chest are back because I know this isn’t right and being with him is squeezing the life out of me. I started to feel this strongly about it a year ago (NYE 2017) - I wrote for the first time in ages in my journal that night, saying I just needed out. I’ve let a year pass - I tried so many times to get up the courage to end this, but I get paralysed with fear of... something. I guess the fact that I’ve built a mess on top of a mess and it may all collapse, together with the fact my friends and family would be devastated to learn I’d kept the marriage from them. I just know I can’t carry on, I need out. Any advice on how  to just do this without thinking so hard about it all would be appreciated.

TL;DR: Married in secret, big mistake, feel stuck and don’t know how to get out."
61,"I (20F) don't know how to balance my relationships with my bf (20M) and parents


Some background: my parents are suuuuuper religious immigrants. i'm talking orthodox christian, not allowed to date or talk to boys strict. I got into a lot of trouble in high school dating my boyfriend but we've been together for 5 years and my parents have warmed up to the idea of him. 


I am not a religious person, and I want to live a normal life with my bf (travelling, living together, etc) but my parents stop all of this. I've never had a good relationship with my parents until i moved out for university. I want to continue to be on good terms with them but I don't want to compromise my life and stuff because of them.  I'm torn between doing what I want and asking them to accept it (risking that they won't), and just complying with everything they ask. 


Some other relavent details: my parents were emotionally and physically abusive in high school and i have a lot of resentment towards them for it but also I feel guilty because I know they made a lot of sacrifices for me and my siblings and that me not being religious and wanting to live with my boyfriend and stuff is heartbreaking for them. I'm also not financially dependent on them per se but they help me a lot in other ways (making food and shopping and stuff).

I met this girl through a good friend, she is amazing we are very compatible and we had an amazing time talking to each other for about 10 days before we met up in real life
We met up 4 times, she stayed the night on the 3rd meeting and it was amazing. It was not something I have experienced before I had such a deep connection with her and really enjoyed having her around. 

Some background, she is a catholic, and while she has had oral sex with previous guys she has never had sex. when she stayed over I had sex with her for the first time so I felt very privileged and feel a very special connection with her. I expect that she felt that the time is right and that she was very comfortable to do it with me. 

We get along really well however she has a controlling mother that didn't know anything about us till today. She interrogated the daughter and has told her that she is not allowed to see me and that the relationship is terminated. 

I have offered to have a chat to the mum to explain the situation but I was told not to approach her. I have mentioned that I would do anything to keep this going as I see real potential in it that would lead to marriage but didn't get a response.

I am not sure what to do, I don't want to walk away without a fight and really want this girl in my life but not sure what's the best thing to do here. 

TLDR: connected with someone 15 years younger, had an amazing time together, she trusted me with her virginity even though she had much longer relationships in the past and just waited on sex. 
She sent me a text saying that her mother is not allowing her to see me. She liven at home with her parents.

I got dumped. Shocker right? It happened a few days ago, and I’m not sad, more so confused. We’d been having issues. We fought pretty much weekly over texts I would send him. The fight that caused the break up was over how obsessed he was with sex. 

Every time we hanged out he would talk about it, and he always ignored me whenever I said the conversation was making me uncomfortable. We had something similar happen, where I was at a movie theater with him, and he kept sticking his hand down my pants even after I told him no. I told him I didn’t like sex, that I’m asexual, and that sex wasn’t going to happen. I’ve told him that in person multiple times. And he never got it. 

Suddenly, after the 20th time of telling him that in texts he “gets it”. Which honestly he really didn’t. He just did the same shit he always does, blame his past for his own Douchy actions. He had bad relationships in the past, Okay cool I understand they give you a lot of baggage. But every time he did something that hurt me he’d cite his previous relationship as an excuse. That he “doesn’t know better”. 

He gets mad that I don’t acknowledge that he called himself an idiot and apologized. I admit I was bitch back to him and literally asked him if he wanted a cookie for apologizing. That’s what kicked him off. 

He started screaming at me, that he was sick of me and bullshit, that his friends were happy to be rid of me, that nobody liked me, that he shoulda listened to them and left me and that he was done. And that every time he said he was sorry and apologized he was lying. So I listened, got in my car, and left. Didn’t feel shit till he called me later crying that he didn’t mean it that he was frustrated because I wasn’t listening to him, and that he still wants to work things out. 

But... I’m in a difficult place. On one hand, I was raised into believing that if somebody wants out of your life they weren’t meant to be in it. My parents actively taught me to not take back an ex if they break up with you. 

On the other hand I love him. Or loved. I’m not sure anymore. He kept saying he didn’t mean what he said and it’s confusing. I talked with some friends and they told me it wasn’t my fault. But at the same time I can’t help the guilt. 

And now he keeps saying that “even if I leave I’ll still care about you” shit and ugh. It’s messing with me. 

Is it worth accepting him back in my life? Or should I just cut the cord completely? Half of me is wanting him gone and the other half... is confused. And hurt. And probably just desperate for love if I’m honest. 

TLDR: boyfriend dumped me after a fight over him pressuring me into sex, he immediately called after trying to get me back and I’m now confused. "
64,"I feel like our relationship don't matter to my gf


So I've met this amazing girl that I've been seeing for a month (yes I know, just a month). We see each other once a week if not once in two weeks.

This month and the upcoming months she's gonna be really busy at work. I work 6 days a week so my only free full day is on a Sunday. And all I really want to do is spend that full day with her especially during the holidays. 

Whenever I try to make plans with her, she barely have time for me.she says she has a lot of group friends and try to fit everyone into her schedule but I feel like during the beginning of a relationship, we're suppose to be in a honeymoon phase. We did however spend 6hrs together on Christmas day when I was told I asnt gonna see her but it was because her original plan got canceled. So it seems that she only sees me when she have free time and doesn't make time to see me. Also if I don't initiates a conversation via text or just send a simple text it seems like we wouldn't even even talk for the whole week. I just feel like I'm putting all the effort into the relationship and as her bf I wish I could be more prioritized . When I told her I wish she didn't have so much friends (jokingly ofc) so I could spend more time with her, she was like  ""hey I never said dating me was easy "" am I just over thinking things? Am I asking too much? 

Tl:Dr: our relationship is not a priority to my girlfriend."

68,"(M21) Was in abusive relationships 5 years ago and I’m ready to move past them but it’s difficult.


I apologize in advance for the long post.

For context, my first relationship was with my best friend who was the first girl I ever truly loved. We had a lot in common and enjoyed the time we had together. Things started to Change a couple of months in whenever it became more sexual. At first it was minor harmless fun but as it turns out, it started happening back at school. At this point I would really be adamant about saying “no” but she wouldn’t listen and would do it anyways. Almost every single time and eventually I have in because it was either say no and have her be heartbroken because I didn’t “love her” or just let it happen.

Eventually I started to realize this wasn’t what I wanted from a relationship and I tried talking about. At least twice a week I would bring up how I didn’t want this to be what our relationship was based off of. She would say she’s understood but it would continue. I would try to break up with her but then she would figure out a way to guilt me into starting and I would fall for it. Now I just felt trapped in this relationship with someone I loved continually hurting me everyday. At some point I’d though it would be best to try to get her to break up with me. I would just ask for kinda suggest for extra favors and really just try and be almost like a jerk. I’m hind sight I feel bad that I did this but in the moment I didn’t know what to do. It didn’t work.

Towards the end of the school year I had enough and finally broke it off, but then she threatened to take her life. And I didn’t want that, I still loved and cared for her. I was upset, worried, confused and hurt. I ended up getting back with her. This happened a couple more times and at times I was pissed and just said that I don’t care, just leave me alone. I would snap out of it after a minute and apologize and tell her not too but I feel bad to this day for even saying that. Finally, I somehow managed to finally end the relationship without the threat. It was empty and I felt drained and broken. I lost someone I loved and my best friend that day. 

A year later, I somehow reason with myself that it would be a good idea to date someone else. We meet a few months prior at school and she asked me out. So I said yes. Things went smoothly until I started to notice similar patterns, but this time she would get mad that I had a social life and she didn’t. It was something my ex also did, she would slowly commit off everyone because I was all they needed. And I loved to spent time with whoever I’m with but I do have life long friends that I can’t just give up. It may sound shitty but I hate losing friends. She also became more sexual and at this point I hated it from the previous relationship. It just hurt me so much and she knew that. After about 5 months I wanted to break up and she also threaten to take her life. Then she stopped responding. At this point I thought, “this can not be happening again. I can’t let her do this to herself and me.” I’m really worried and I call the cops on her to make sure she didn’t do it. She was okay, she was just ignoring me. Her Dad made her apologize the next day and he thanked me. 

Ever since then, for 4 years I’ve been struggling so much with depression, anxiety, and trust issues. I’ve had to see a therapist for a few months and I came to terms with somethings but I can’t get over how quickly they moved on from it. And I started to worry about why I couldn’t, and if I deserve this and that every little self doubt and insecurities I had were true. 

However, I’ve recently felt happier and more open to things. I even find myself liking someone again and I want to ask her out but I’m really scared. I’m scared the same thing will happen to me even though she is such a nice, kind, and caring person. 

I don’t know how to get over this feeling. I don’t know what to do.
 

TL;DR 

I was in abusive relationships 5 years ago and it’s been a struggle getting over them. I found someone recently and have grown to like them a lot but I’m scared things will turn out the same way.

69,"Is It possible for my ex bf [34/m] to be interested but not contact me?


I was just curious about this concept. My ex bf and I broke up because arguing and tough situations with his family and health situations where we argued and broke up and he was hurt that I left and took me back a couple times and wouldn't later because I hurt him by leaving him during tough times. So but when we see eachother at church he's a deacon there on stage he constantly stares at me, fidgets, leaves through my exit on purpose and says hi. I tried saying let's meet after I hadn't seen him for a while at church he said ""it won't work today and that he had to take his dad to alteration etc"" I didn't ask for another day and he didn't offer, could it be that he wants to as well but didn't say so because he's hurt?

**TL;DR** Is it possble for him to still have feelings since he's acting the way he is but not make a move?"

So my(F24) couple friends have this guy friend(M27) who is single and they want to set me up with him, but spontaneously. They want me to come to their place for NYE party so we can all hang out and so that I can get to know him better. I already met him at their party once, but I was in a relationship at that time so I do not even remember him, we didn't even talk. I am interested, but I feel I would be awkward and ""not myself"" because they probably said the same thing to him,  that they want him to meet me. Do you guys have maybe experiences with setting up? Does that work?  Should I go? I was also invited to NYE party with other group of friends, so now I have to decide if I should go to a chill house party where I can meet this guy and see if I like him or I can go to a club have fun and dance and drink all night.

74,"Is it time to move on?


I'm (20M) currently in a bit of a pickle with my ex (19F) whom I dated for 13 months back in 2016. She has recently been dumped by the boyfriend she dated (for 15 months) several months after me. I reached out in support due to my mother's concern for her and got feeling again after she spent a few nights over the next week at mine. 

After a week or so of this, she hits me with the ""I'm sorry for leading you on"" speech. I am confused as she said during that and even afterwards that she has considered getting back with me, as she has missed me dearly ect, but isn't ready for any relationship any time soon despite there being feelings there. 

Basically my question is, do I stay and wait for her to heal and hope we eventually bond back together, or do I just move on? I truly do love this girl, but feel like ever since that speech she has been very distant. I'm not sure if I give her space and hope my absence is felt, to be there for her more then I am currently or just to go and find someone else. 

**TL;DR;** : After a short fling, my ex who I have recently gotten back into contact with has become distant, apologizing for leading me on ect. She says this despite claiming she has feelings and has considered getting back with me, but isn't ready for a relationship due to a recent break up. Do I stay and pursue? Do I stay distant and give her space? Do I just leave and move on? "
75,"How do I [20M] spend quality time with my girlfriend [18F]?


As an introvert, I'm naturally quiet and not extremely talkative. My girlfriend of 1 year told me today that it seems like I don't like to spend time with her.

This is not true, and I have asserted that. The problem, I think, is that we don't really share much in common and so my options of things to do and meaningful conversational topics are pretty limited. I've exhausted my list of interesting topics a long time ago.

When she talks to me, it is usually about her schoolwork of classmates. She claims to not have hobbies and thus only ever talks about work. I naturally just sit back and let her talk and listen. Sometimes, this makes me feel uncomfortable because she would complain about the same issue every day for a whole week and I literally do not know what else to say to console her or otherwise. This has to lead to arguments in the past when I got frustrated after a few days and essentially told her its not as big of a deal as she makes it out to be in an effort to comfort her (I am pretty bad at comforting people, my bad). As such, these days I just listen and still don't really know how to respond. This obviously makes me seem uninterested and distant when I'm with her.

I have tried to take her out for interesting activities that we can enjoy together and perhaps develop mutual interests to do and talk about, but none of it has stuck. Her life seems to revolve around school work and she has no time for anything else. Her free time is spent doing assignments, and she does none of the stereotypical girl stuff like watching Netflix or go shopping or anything. Its literally just work, and so much work that she does not have time for any form of leisure whatsoever. It's not even that she enjoys doing schoolwork, she only does so out of necessity. She also claims that she doesn't have time to read anymore, and that was like the only one hobby she could identify. I don't mind that she doesn't have hobbies, but how would I have anything interesting to talk to her about?

It doesn't help that she is my junior taking the same cs degree (but at a different school). This makes me feel that most of the time we spend together is doing work, not my idea of quality time. 

I enjoy spending time with her, but just not the activity. At this point, I have no idea what to do anymore. We are slowly growing distant and I am already enjoying the time spent with other friends more because of shared hobbies. What should I do?

Tl;dr: Girlfriend feels that I don't enjoy the time I spend with her. I do enjoy the time spent with \*her\*, but not the (lack of) activities we do together. We don't have much in common outside of work and she has no time to try anything else, and generally lacks interest in anything else. I don't mind the silence, but it makes her feel that I don't enjoy the time with her. What should I do?

76,"My [32M] Marriage Checklist


It amazes me when I ask people about this they can only give very simple basic common sense answers. No wonder divorce is so high. I asked one girl the other day and her response was ""he loves me and is a good man"". Left me shaking my head. Here is a checklist for you use when finding a suitable match to increase long term happiness and success.

**1) Easy going**

This is by far one of if not the most personal characteristic a person who are dating should have. It will make your life and relationship a million times easier and enjoyable. This person is easy to be around, easy to plan things with, easy to deal with problems and issues, looks for solutions and understanding vs arguing / fighting. This is a broad all encompassing trait with sub-traits that can be related. a. **Unselfish** b. **Not overly jealous** c. **Unneedy**

**2) Simple**

Is content with basic things and focuses more on things like family, health, friends vs extrinsic things. **Not materialistic**. Money is one of the biggest causes for marriage issues. Want a partner that isn't gonna leave you if you lose your good paying job and have to downgrade from a nice big house on the golf course to a small basic home.

**3) Good Communicator**

Talking is crucial for a healthy relationship. You and your partner need to be active in **discussing your feelings, desires, aspirations, concerns** etc. Keeping things bottled inside isn't going to do anyone any good. So many unneeded problems and issues arise and develop when it could have been easily ironed out with discussion.

**4) Dependable / Reliable / Stable**

Let someone else deal with the **bipolar** person. Let someone else deal with the **alcoholic**. Let someone else deal wit the person who **can't keep a job**. Let someone else deal with the person who has a **spending/debt problem**.

**5) Similar / Acceptable Life &amp; Parenting Ideas**

Need to be on the same page as far as various **life goals, expectations, religion** and **parenting**. If you want to spank your kid and raise them in the church and your partner doesn't thats gonna create a lot of problems.

**6) Sexual Compatibility**

Partner needs to be able to **satisfy you sexually**. Some things can be learned and changed, some things can't.

TL;DR

You need to have certain things you look for in a partner. The list above should cover most of the crucial stuff. Obviously I left out basic stuff like **love, honesty, faithful**, etc Of course someone should love you and be a good person. This should  honestly be non negotiable. "

78,"Feel as though my girlfriend only has sex with me for my benefit...


Hi guys, this is my first ever internet post of any kind but im not sure where to turn. I've seen others post about similar problems here on reddit and people always seem to have very good advice.
Now abit of background I (22M) have been with my GF (22F) 3 years and the relationship is lovely, always going on dates together, out for food cinema, visiting other cities etc very rarely argue about anything at all and the relationship is really smooth in all areas bar one. I'm really starting to get frustrated at the fact my girlfriend seems to not even be bothered about our sex life in the SLIGHTEST. Everytime I try to start to sexting or dirty talking, even really playfully it will get shut down by something/anything ""oh I saw so and so today"" or ""I had this for my lunch"" whatever it could literally be anything! also in the bedroom I am really adventurous and want to try things all the time and she is just not into anything, I don't think once during the entire relationship I've ever seen her actually initiate sex. 

Since we've been together I feel as though shes made no effort whatsoever to try and improve our sex life whereas I'm always asking questions  trying new things etc but i just get no feedback or anything its just like banging my head against a brick wall.

HOWEVER. The frequency of our sex is fine by my standards we have sex a few times a week and this is enough for me however it's just the feeling That she is just having sex to satisfy me in some way and that she could just ""take it or leave it"" as it were and this thought really really hurts... I have asked her and shes said it's not the case but would anyone actually admit this? She does admit that she doesn't initiate sex etc though but never gave me a reason just sort of ""yeah... I know I don't.""

I'm at a loss. I've tried communicating this problem with her before in the past and she changes for all of about afew days and then reverts back to her previous self. I've taken every measure, I've tried new things to see if I can spark any kind of passion put of her but its just not happening.

Before anyone says I'm not good at fucking or whatever she orgasms basically everytime and shes joked saying I have ""99% success rate"" in that department etc.

It might not seem like a huge deal to other people but 3 years of having a girlfriend who you think isn't bothered about fucking you really starts to take its toll. I feel I haven't done a very good job of getting the exact feeling through on this post but just its probably enough information to get the general picture of what's been going on.

Does anyone have personal experience with this situation?
Am I asking for too much, I really do not want to throw the relationship away over this but i fear it may not get better, as I say she's a lovely girl in every aspect but i feel my sexual needs are neglected. Not out of any malicious way but just by her nature. Shes an absolutely lovely girl and I really do love her but this is a problem to me and I've tried to sort it but it won't go. Any suggestions?

TL:DR girlfriend makes me feel unwanted by never in 3 years showing any desire for sex and shutting down any attempt at flirting or sexting"

81,"Parents (50s M&amp;F) collected our family dog's remains without telling me (19f)


A few weeks ago, my small family had to put down our elderly dog, as he was quite sick. This dog grew up with me, and was my best friend, carrying me through the ups and downs of growing up, as well as providing me a sense of security and companionship when overcoming physical and sexual trauma from a previous partner. To say that I miss him would be an understatement. I looked into his eyes, petting him and telling him how much I loved him when he passed away, surrounded by our family. The people at the vet's office were really nice, and said they would mail us a pawprint, and we could pick up the cremains in an urn I picked out in two week's time. I went home with my folks, and frequently thought about when I could bring my little fur baby home.

The following weeks were difficult to process my grief, as I had to forget about what happened in order to study for multiple exams, work, and prepare for Christmas. I'd cry in the shower, or late at night, when my parents couldn't hear me. My mom was particularly close to the dog, and I would hide being upset as to not upset her. As a result, I feel quite alone in my grief. We spent Christmas away from home, and it was a relatively positive experience, despite me having to sometimes spend some time alone and cry when I missed my dog too much. More than two weeks had passed since putting him down, and I figured that the mailed pawprint and urn were taking a while because of reduced service during the holiday season.

Yesterday, I approached my mother and asked her when the dog's remains would be coming home. She told me that she had taken the urn home a few days before Christmas, and chose not to tell anyone. She said that she was too upset to tell anyone about it, and that it just would have upset me. I told her that I felt hurt by her excluding me from bringing him home, and that I would have to at least been notified that he had come home so I could see the urn. All she would say was that her intentions were good, and that she didn't want to see me upset. My father said something similar, but didn't comment as much. 

My mother asked me today if I felt the same way as I did yesterday, and I said yes. I asked her how she would have felt if she were  the one to be excluded, and not know where her dog's remains were for over a week. I tried to reason with her and try to have her understand my point of view, but she just said it was too hard for her to let either my dad or I know that she had brought him home. I asked her, why didn't you just text us to let us know? We didn't have to talk about it if she was too upset, I just wanted to know where she was. I told her how hurt I felt. She said, 'I'm sorry you feel that way."" I replied that I wanted a real apology, as what she did wasn't the right choice, and it hurt me. This upset her even more, and she just kept repeating that this wasn't all about me, and that ''it's done now!!!"". This ended the conversation, and she stalked off to be in her room alone.

 I feel shattered. She told me when the dog passed away that we would 'come together' and 'heal as a family', but I've never felt more alone. I want to do the right thing by my dog's memory and family, but I don't know how this can be fixed.

&amp;#x200B;

**tl;dr** \- My parents retrieved and have been keeping our family dog's cremains without my knowledge, and are reluctant/refuse to acknowledge that they upset me by excluding me. "
82,"Should I give him a chance, even with a few physical turn offs? (21/f to 21/m)


Hi. I recently met this guy and we get along very well. He's great company and when I'm with him I don't want him to leave. When I think about it I want to be more than friends with him. He's funny, comforting, seems to show concern about me, and he definitely likes me as well. But I have no desire to have sex with him yet. There are a couple of physical turn offs, and that's his skinniness and his breath, which always seems to smell off to me. Sometimes I don't even want to kiss him because of it. We've only seen each other about five times, but it's been on my mind. I do like him a lot as a person and like looking at his face, but it's just those things I noticed that bothers me. I find myself comparing the situation to my only other boyfriend, and whereas I immediately wanted to have sex with him, I don't for this guy. I don't get butterflies for him like I did for my ex. He has a far better personality though, which is why I'm willing to give him a chance. I don't have a lot of experience dating, so I'm unsure if those physical flaws fade over time as you get to know each other or if it's going to become an issue.

83,"My fiancé [24M] and I [24F] could use some advice about our wedding and unplanned pregnancy


 

I don't know if this is the right place to post this, but we could use some advice on this situation both for ourselves and how to address this with our family members.

&amp;#x200B;

Our wedding is planned for July 1, 2019, on a cruise ship. We left the option open for people to just attend the wedding before the ship leaves or to cruise with us if they wanted to come. We didn’t want a large wedding and the cruise leaves from Florida, the majority of the people attending are from Ohio/Kentucky so we didn’t expect a lot of people to attend the wedding or cruise, which honestly is a a big reason we chose this option. Quite a few people have decide to attend, roughly 50-60 people. My fiancé is the youngest of six children and most of his siblings have kids, so while it is mostly close family there are a few friends coming also.

&amp;#x200B;

So I just found out I’m pregnant and I will be too far along in July to be allowed to cruise. We had been planning to start trying for a baby in May next year. And while this isn’t a bad thing, the timing is horrible. My fiancé and I are conflicted about what we should do. We would feel terrible about people spending so much money and then cancelling on them. But with that said, most of the people going cruise regularly and they could choose to go on this cruise or get a voucher to use towards another cruise within the next two years, minus the deposit which was like $50-$100 depending on the booking. Not ideal, but better than losing out on all the money. Also after speaking with the travel agent right before Christmas, nobody had made any additional payments on their bookings other than the original deposit and for some, the first payment. The exception to this is us, my parents, one of my fiancé’s siblings who paid in full, and one other guest who has made sporadic payments. All of the payments that have been made so far would be included in the voucher to use on another cruise.

&amp;#x200B;

If we decided to cancel the cruise wedding, the amount paid to the cruise line for the wedding would not be refunded. We would still have a wedding just close to home. So the wedding would still be a small event. We never wanted anything big, which is why we chose a cruise wedding. I feel that the majority of our guests would understand why we canceled the cruise considering the circumstances.

&amp;#x200B;

The other option is to terminate the pregnancy. This would affect me more than anyone else. I don’t know how this would affect our relationship, but I know it would put stress on it and us for sure. I don’t think we would even tell anyone about the pregnancy if we went with this option just because I know some of our family members would be very vocal in their objections. However this would make the cruise wedding able to continue as planned. But it would definitely push back our plans for starting a family. Part of me feels like it is selfish to abort just to have a wedding. But it is also selfish to not think about everyone else and how much they are spending on attending this wedding.

&amp;#x200B;

My fiancé feels the same as I do about this. Neither of us are really leaning 100% one way right now, but we need to make a decision soon. I was concerned and upset immediately following the pregnancy test. I showed my fiancé the test and his first emotion was excitement and happiness. But after a few hours he started to think things through about the wedding and I think he is having mixed emotions now. He is excited about having a child together but is concerned about our wedding and everyone involved. We could really use some advice on this. How would you feel as one of our guests or if you were in our position? Should we discuss it with close family members?

&amp;#x200B;

 tl;dr: An unplanned pregnancy is throwing a wrench in our wedding plans. Need some advice on what to do and how to address those involved."

After this had happened, I was unsure about the stability of our relationship due to his anger issues. BF has never been aggressive towards me, it has only been towards SD.


About 2 days ago, BF was visiting my flat, he told me wasn't in the mood and wanted to be on his own (His grandma died a few weeks ago and the funeral is only a few days away) BF went home and then a few hours later, I received a text from him saying he smashed his SD's iPad. He didn't tell me the reason why so I assumed he smashed it for no reason. The next day, BF told me why he smashed the iPad, he done it punish his SD for the way he has been acting around me and how he treats me. 


Me and my BF have been together for 18 months, he has been extremely supportive towards me and has always looked out for me, that is the reason why I'm so conflicted at the moment. I appreciate anyone's advice and help.

86,"My(F24) friends want to set me up with this guy (M27) on NYE


tl;dr My(F24) friends want to set me up with this guy (M27) on NYE

So my(F24) couple friends have this guy friend(M27) who is single and they want to set me up with him, but spontaneously. They want me to come to their place for NYE party so we can all hang out and so that I can get to know him better. I already met him at their party once, but I was in a relationship at that time so I do not even remember him, we didn't even talk. I am interested, but I feel I would be awkward and ""not myself"" because they probably said the same thing to him,  that they want him to meet me. Do you guys have maybe experiences with setting up? Does that work?  Should I go? I was also invited to NYE party with other group of friends, so now I have to decide if I should go to a chill house party where I can meet this guy and see if I like him or I can go to a club have fun and dance and drink all night.

87,"My (30F) boyfriend (29M) revealed to me that he used to be a cocaine dealer up until three years ago, and that his family is a 'crime family' as he describes it. I am not sure how to react.


I've been dating this guy for 7 months now, we are boyfriend and girlfriend. I am supposed to go meet his brother for the first time in a few days. My BF (Ivan is his name) told me last night that he has to tell me something about his family which he has mostly held a secret. He told me that his family is very much involved in crime and drug dealing in Philadelphia and new york, and that he was involved too for quite a bit in his 20s, mostly dealing cocaine with his cousin. He said he was never really apart of the real criminal stuff they did, he just really needed money so he would put money down on a 'package' he got from his cousin every month or so, and had 2 guys 'under him' who sold it out for him. He reassured me that it wasn't out of some kind of loyalty to his family, and that he was never truly involved in any of the bigger stuff they did, and that this was purely out of the fact that he needed money at the time. 

&amp;#x200B;

We live in San Jose, his family is all the way out in the east coast. So he is far away from them, and that is 'how he likes it' as he describes it. He says they are cruel, manipulative people, and that he regrets ever working with his cousin. The only good one is his brother, who is a seemingly normal college guy according to his facebook at least. Ivan told me his brother had a falling out with his family after he went to college and doesn't speak to them, so I am not really worried about talking to some sketchy mobster or anything when I meet his brother. 

&amp;#x200B;

But what he told me... it just sounds so serious. I mean he literally dealt cocaine for what I presume is a mafia related family. HIS family, not just any family. What am I supposed to do if I meet his parents? I feel scared even thinking about that. 

&amp;#x200B;

I really, really like him. But now I am just looking at him completely different. He is muscular and sort of masculine looking but I never ever thought of him as the kind of tough guy involved with crime kind of guy. I mean the guy plays pokemon and watches anime television shows still, at 29 years old, the idea of him being a coke dealer for some mafia family is almost laughable, but apparently that is (well, was) the reality of it. And he does seem to regret his decisions, but the fact that he still did that, and was involved with that, and was raised around that kind of stuff... it just makes me see him very differently now. 

&amp;#x200B;

What do you guys think? 

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR - - found out my boyfriend used to be a coke dealer and that his family is some kind of organized crime family. "
88,"Is my (28F) girlfriend materialistic or am I (26F) just resentful?


TL;DR - Money is a huge value for her but not for me. 

We've been together 1.5 years. She makes a ridiculous amount of money (somewhere in the 6 figures) and I'm just a grad student with an okay part time. She is wonderful and we've been crazy in love. However, our values differ, and she places a high importance on money while I don't. 

This is most apparent in her friends. They're all about as successful and in a similar field. They are great and friendly people but very materialistic. Sometimes their entire conversations are exclusively about money. It's clear that they (and she) only chose their field for money, while I chose mine for meaningful work, future salary only marginally important, so I cringe through them. 

When it's just us though I rarely see this side of her. Occasionally though she'll make a comment that'll catch me off guard. The one that still bothers me is, ""I've never been on a date with anyone as successful as me. This city is just full of wannabes who aren't that successful."" She didn't grow up well-off and is mostly down to earth and extremely loving, so these comments feel so out of place, as if ideas have been drilled into her by work or other people. I take huge issue with people who think they're better than others so these comments really bother me. 

I know part of it is that I feel resentful that she's been making 6 figures since she was my age and I'm barely finishing grad school, while I feel like I've worked harder and she was just well connected. I also feel bad about this because she's been nothing but supportive of my goals. I find myself looking for career paths that pay more to close the income discrepancy between us when I'll no longer be able to blame grad school for my low income, and that's something I've never previously cared about. 

A lot of the issue revolves around how I feel, and I'm wondering, can I fix this? How can I stop feeling resentful? Or is this a value difference that's big enough to cause problems in the future? In all other ways we feel perfect together and I want so much for this relationship to work. "
89,"I (M 24) feel sorry for my ex girlfriend (F 24) and don't know what to do...


I broke up with my girlfriend two weeks ago she was be with me for 5 years. Today I saw a picture of her and her sister hanging out in a lake and his face look sad like she cried. And her status in WhatsApp is so depressing. I don't want to go back with her but she is a good girl and I want the best for her and we weren't good together.

So should I talk to her or should I just let the time do its job.

Thank you for your time is my first publication and my English is not really good I hope you understand the situation.

TL;DR I'm sorry but the story is short enough but it's a real dilema..."
90,"Do I (F,30) need to accept that i can't have love whilst I'm a carer for my mum?


4 years ago I became a carer for my mother after she broke her back. Dad left while she was in hospital and I don't have any contact with him. A few months after this I got together with my then best friend (M31). He had just started at grad school 500miles away. Since then we have been in a long distance relationship and I have lived with my mum looking after her. 
He has just finished and has just told me he can't see a future where him and I live together. I am always going to have to live with or very near to my mum. I have always thought we could live in a house with an annexe for mum or live in houses in the same village but apparently  this isn't  an option for him. From previous conversations I thought we were on the same page but apparently not. Am I asking too much?


Tl:Dr: Do I just need to accept that all the time I am looking after my mum I won't be able to have a romantic relationship?"
91,"Unfriending a ghoster


I'm a 39 year old woman  who was in a relationship with a 38 year old man. We started our relationship before actually going on a date. We began talking long distance and really liked each other. The guy was love bombing me which I wasn't aware of at the time. When he returned home we were intimate but he had to leave out of town again for work. We maintained consistent communication.

When he returned home again for the second time he started blowing me off about plans to spend time with each other. He then disappeared for 3days. I called him out on it and he apologized. Then he disappeared for 5days. He reappeared on xmas day via text merry Christmas sweetheart. I ignored his text. Mainly because I was really hurt but I'd seen him posting videos of himself with other women on Instagram and Facebook while disappeared. Do you think my ignoring his last text and unfriending him on Facebook might have hurt his ego? 

TL;DR Unfriending a ghoster"
92,"Does [F15] like me?


For starters about a week after school started, I \[M16\] was sitting in Math class and was working on a problem and looked up at and my crush(lets call her Elise) was looking at me and we made eye contact before we both looked away. The next week she got a schedule change and is no longer in my Math class. Also, while we were still in the same class, every time someone asked a question she turned and looked at the person and as she turned and looked I could tell she was looking in my general area multiple times.

About 4 weeks after she switched out of my Math class, I was standing outside of my Chemistry class in the morning, she was sitting nearby and I was on my phone but I kept seeing her look up at me. Later walked away to class and she stared at me and I kinda smiled at her a little. About a week later in the same place I was walking by and she was going to class and we almost ran into each other and I walked past her and I turned and she stopped and looked back at me.

There is a specific place in the school where like 20-40 people chill in the morning depending on the day. Me and my friends are always there in the morning and so is my crush and her friends and some other kids.

A little later on, I was walking toward the place where I always chill in the morning and she was walking like 150 feet behind me and I kept walking for about 500 feet when I stop for water, she was right behind me and she passes me, turns around and walks back towards me and looks at me. Then, the next week I was walking to the place I chill in the morning, she was ahead of me walking and she turned and looked at me and walked my way. Later she was sitting in “the place” which is in the opposite direction of the way she turned and walked toward me.

Later on during lunch, Elise and her friends sat near where I usually sit. Elise kept looking at me throughout the whole lunch. Also, a few days later, me and my friend were waiting in the front of the school and Elise and her friends were there and Elise’s posture changed pretty quickly and nicely. Also, we made eye contact a lot.

Also later on there was a fire drill and me and her and one of her friends were making eye contact with you. Also, like a day later my crush and that same friend walked past me life 50 ft, turned around and both looked at me. Later on, I was walking out of class to lunch with one of Elise’s friends talking with her when Elise walks by to hang out with her friend at lunch and she looked a little freaked when she saw me with her friend.

For the last 3 weeks of the semester I stopped going to ""the place"" in the morning and she stopped giving me these signals.

I’’m wondering if she likes me.

TLDR: wondering if she likes me,"
