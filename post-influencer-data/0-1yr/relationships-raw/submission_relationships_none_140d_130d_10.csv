0,"My [22m] sister [7f] was adopted a year ago and we still haven't really bonded significantly/she doesn't particularly like me. Is there something I can do to help her feel safer around me?


She was adopted and at first she would barely speak to anyone. She was seen by pediatricians and the regular people from the adoption system and it wasn't a developmental delay, she was just adjusting and was understandably afraid.

I barely interacted with her in the first few months. I would try to talk to in low pressure environments while mom and/or dad were around, and she wouldn't really acknowledge my presence much and I kinda saw that she was a little intimated so I would back off.

Today she's very open with mom and dad and is adjusting well to school. I usually drop by their home once or twice a week plus the times when I drive either of them around and she tags along. I say hi and she says hi back but doesn't interact with me further than that. If I ask stuff like how's school she gets visibly uncomfortable and doesn't say anything. Sometimes mom or dad give me the answer for the question and she stays quiet.

If mom and dad say things like ""hey your brother's here"" she'll wave at me but won't interact further than that and sometimes even sort of hide behind them or cling to them if I approach her.

Last weekend dad and I were repairing a water pipe, mom was doing the laundry and she was at the kitchen table drawing. I asked her if she wanted chocolate milk without really expecting an answer, just sort of letting her know, and she jumped and said ""yes!"". I got her a small ladder so she could reach the counter and she whipped the milk while I prepared the rest. I asked her a few things and she was very receptive and we probably had a more organic interaction than any other in the past year. Mom was really happy to see us get along.

So, that was really fun and I wish we could have more of those. I drove her and mom somewhere yesterday and it was more like all the other non-interactions we've had before.

I like her a lot. I love that she's part of our family and I feel a strong impulse to take care of her and make sure she's OK, and I wish I could be closer to her. I see her having a good time and being perfectly comfortable being around our parents, telling them stuff about her day, cuddling them in the couch, little things that, and I wish we could share them.

I understand that it is all up to her, she's still adjusting, and I won't ever pretend to cross any boundaries into uncomfortable territory for her. As general advice, are there things I can do that would contribute to making her feel safer in general? To adjust? And ways bond like last weekend?

**tl;dr:** Little sister was adopted a year ago, she's still adjusting and she's extremely shy around me and we mostly don't interact. Is there anything I can to help her adjust and ways for us to bond?"
1,"My (37M) wife (38F) kept encouraging our son (14M) to meet new friends since we moved. He's become good friends with the girl next door (14F) and my wife is upset.


I met my wife at college. I've been with for 17 years and married for 13. We have three children together. Wendy (9F), Nick (9M) and Joey (14M). My wife got a great career opportunity to join a big legal firm. The only problem was we'd need to move to Boston. It was a hard conversation to have with Joey because he pissed. You know how teenagers are when you give them life changing news. He didn't take it well at all and he didn't talk to us for a week. Wendy and Nick then started to act like Joey because he's the older brother. It was was a big ordeal we had to deal with. 

When we first got to Boston 2 months ago, Joey wasn't coping well with the change. He kept moaning about everything. He hated everything and everyone. A month ago his attitude completely changed. He started coming home late saying he was at a friend's house. He started going out on Saturday and Sundays to next door. Before I knew there was this girl, Kelsey, was walking into our house with Joey. They're always at either our house or next door. They walk home from school. They do things together. 

Last night my wife had a meltdown before we went to bed. She burst into tears because she thinks the two of them are dating, and she's terrified Joey is going to get this girl pregnant. I don't get the sense that they're dating. They just seem like good friends. She's been doing things before this like going to Joey's room to check up on them. She's just become paranoid. This morning she asked if he and Abby couldn't do homework together. He asked why and she gave him some weird answer looking at me to say something. 

I tried talking to her about this and she's just fixated on the fact that they're teenagers and she knows what they're like. 

**TL;DR: How do I get my wife to stop being so weird about our sons first friend since we moved?**"
2,"I [17m] kicked a friend [17m] out of my car last night for making fun of my girlfriend [16f]. Still mad, but worried I overreacted?


Okay, so my girlfriend has a little bit of a speech impediment. She has a little bit of a lisp and stutters sometimes. It's really not that serious and definitely not as noticeable as she tends to think it is, but I know she gets really embarrassed about it.

Last night we were at a party at one of her friends place. The party was kinda winding down and we were about to leave to go hang out more low-key with some of my friends. 

A guy I know found his way to me and asked if he could ride with us since he was a little drunk. I told him that was cool and we all left.

Dude turned out to be more than a little drunk and was acting pretty obnoxious. My girlfriend said something an stuttered a little bit and the guy started laughing, and then started saying everything with a fake stutter.

I just asked him ""seriously, dude?"" And he acted all offended and then said ""I'm just joking!"" And then turned to my girl and started asking her really aggressively ""You're cool with it, right?""

I told him I didn't really care if she knew he was joking, he was pissing me off and was about to lose his ride. He made one last comment like ""it's not my fault your girl doesn't know how to talk.""

I turned my car towards the neighborhood he lives in and stopped on his street and told him to get out. He argued a bit but when I wouldn't move he gave up and got out of the car. Girlfriend and I drove on and had a good rest of the night.

Dude texted me today that he got in trouble when I dropped him off because he had intended to stay away from home until he sobered up, but when I dropped him off he was still drunk and his parents noticed. He told me I could have at least dropped somewhere else.

I just told him 'and you could have shut up the first time I warned you"" and haven't talked to him since.

I'm still pissed at the guy, but I really didn't mean to get him in trouble. Did I overreacted? I just wanted him stop shut up, and the only reason I took him to his own house was I didn't want to drop someone drunk off some random place.

Did I do wrong?

**TL;DR** Friend made fun of girlfriend and I kicked him out of my car. He got in trouble. Did I overreact?"
3,"My (31m) wife (34f) is ghosting our marriage


My wife left me on April 9. She came home from work early for the first time in months, said we needed to talk then said we love each other, we care for each other and we’ve never had a lack of affection, but that she’s unhappy and she’s leaving me. She packed a bag while I was trying to talk to her and she left. 

We’ve been together for nearly 10 years. Nothing happened. We weren’t fighting, no skeletons in closets, she didn’t meet somebody else. We’ve both been digging in and trying to get through the grind lately but she did this completely out of the blue. She’s barely talked to me since. She never replies to me, only comes with prepared statements, says them (writes them) and ghosts again without actually talking to me. 

All I can think is that last October her dad died and they were extremely close and it has been really hard on her. I’ve been trying to help as much as I can, I encouraged her to go to a therapist and tried to make her feel loved and comforted at home but instead she’s been throwing herself into work nonstop for probably 6 months at this point. I’m talking 6 am until 9 pm every day.   

She’s not only pushing me out but she’s pushed anyone who asks about us away too. From what I’ve been able to gather from mutual friends she’s working even harder now, and destroying her reputation at work while she’s at it because she’s micromanaging everyone. 

Since she left I’ve been asking her to go to couples therapy with me but she won’t. She refuses to even try and save the relationship. She said it’ll just hurt like this again when it happens next time, but I can’t convince her that there doesn’t have to be a next time. That no matter what we aren’t the same people we were before she left me and that if we try and work together we can grow from this and be stronger. She can’t see any of it and I’m afraid she’s completely ignoring what she’s doing by working so much she can’t think about anything else. 

I hoped her mom could talk her down but she threw me under the bus the second she realized if she pushed back my wife would cut her out, despite the fact I took a lot of time off of work last year to help her after the funeral and after she had some surgeries. My wife’s best friend from work and another of her close friends messaged me separately and both said she’s not acting like herself but they can’t say anything to her or she’ll push them out too. It’s like everyone is just giving her room to self destruct.

I keep telling myself it’s going to be ok, she’s going to realize she doesn’t have to do this, but it’s been 20 days and I’m starting to lose hope. I don’t know what to do. I have my finances in order I know what I can and can’t do on my own, but I can’t leave because I’m not giving up on her but every day I wake up surrounded by the cold remains of “us” and it hurts so bad I can hardly breathe. 

Tl;dr my wife is having a depressive episode (I think) and left me."
4,"[UPDATE] Stepmom(45F) acts like I'm(19F) the ""other woman""


Original post: [https://ud.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/6o8r2i/stepmom45f\_acts\_like\_im19f\_the\_other\_woman/](https://ud.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/6o8r2i/stepmom45f_acts_like_im19f_the_other_woman/)

&amp;#x200B;

Two years after posting this, I can safely say that my family is irreparably fractured. My relationship with my Dad is never going to be the same; in fact, there may not even be a relationship. My younger step-brother (7) has been largely poisoned against me by his Mom. My sister (19) mostly stays away from my Dad's home because it is so uncomfortable. My other sister (14) feels the need to create even more drama, just so she can get a scrap of attention. It has gotten so unbearable that I don't even feel sane anymore.

&amp;#x200B;

When I wrote my last post, I really thought there was a solution to my stepmom's behavior. I had many calm discussions with my Dad where we talked about how damaging stepmom's behavior is. Over time those discussions have gotten more heated and mean. We had gone over it over and over and over to the point that I feel like a broken record. Every time we talked about the issue, he would acknowledge that her behavior is terrible (not in those words because he can't say anything bad about her) and tell me that he didn't know why ""she is like this"".

&amp;#x200B;

I'd ask him why she never liked me over and over again. ""Why did she never try to get to know me? Why is she so cold? What the hell did I do to deserve this?"" are the questions I asked him pretty much every time I saw him. He never had an answer. All he could say in her defense was the he could see ""both sides"" (even though the issue started when I was a fucking kid and did absolutely nothing) and that she was so stressed because she had to clean up and sometimes no one would eat her dinner. Which is an absolute joke because when I raised my younger sisters by myself starting at age 13, they did the exact same thing to me. My 13 year old self NEVER treated them anywhere close to the way stepmom treats me.

&amp;#x200B;

I even tried confronting the source of the problem a few times, but it never helped. It probably made things worse. She would just deny any responsibility for her actions and act like I was absolutely insane. It always devolved into shouting because I would get unimaginably frustrated that no one cared or recognized the borderline abuse. And the terrible part is there was nothing that I could really confront her about. There isn't one big thing that she's done; just 7 years of acting like I am not my father's daughter and like she was the victim of a hate crime. It is so hard to put that into words when someone asks you what exactly stepmom has done that is so irredeemable. I would much prefer that she had done something big; knowing someone hates you but will never show it in any other way than coldness is so much worse to me than anger.

&amp;#x200B;

It got much worse when I had to move back home about 6 months ago because of my financial situation. Also note that I am not freeloading. I have a full time job, I pay my own car bill, I rarely eat their food due to stress-induced appetite loss, I buy all my own clothes, pay for everything related to my dog, and until it got bad I paid rent in the form of using my lunch break to drive my sister home from school (10ish miles from home). And I swear, when I moved in I tried so hard to make things better. I tried so fucking hard to be her friend. But she has just hid away in her room for the majority of the past 6 months, avoiding me. There were some times when it was ok, we'd have friendly conversation, but it never lasted more than a few weeks. I'd either do something unknown to upset her, or she would do something that upset me. 7 years of tension would just bubble over any time anything happened.

&amp;#x200B;

3 months ago, I stopped trying with her. I realized no matter what, she will always hate me. There is no relationship to be had with my stepmom. Ever. And it made me so angry that my Dad didn't care how much I was hurting. He didn't care that the situation made me feel like I was back in that house with my abusive Mom, 13 years old and utterly powerless. So not only did I stop trying, I started being kind of mean. Every time she said something passive aggressive, I'd rudely call her out. Not like it mattered anyway since she rarely talked to me, but I stopped talking to her. I made sure to leave as much as my stuff in the way as much as possible. I stopped doing anything to help stepmom and Dad during my work hours (8-5 M-F, I work from home and used to use my lunch break to drive my sister home from school). I rarely ate her dinners. Stuff like that.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm not necessarily proud of my behavior, but I'm not ashamed either. I hate being mean and it actually doesn't make me feel any better, but I also refuse to just keep ignoring how she treats me. I just wanted something to be different, you know? I didn't care if it made things worse because then maybe someone would finally help me. No one did. My Dad and I began to grow apart and now I have a hard time seeing how he can love me and still let this go on for years.

&amp;#x200B;

And last night, he let it slip my stepmom is trying to manipulate him into kicking me out. She evidently told him she would move out--OF HER OWN FUCKING HOUSE--just to get away from me. It's the most manipulative thing she has ever done. And it absolutely broke my fucking heart to hear that 1. someone hates me that much and 2. that my own father didn't think that was unacceptable thing to say. Yes, for the past 3 months I have not been nice, but I have not been evil. I have certainly not done anything she herself hasn't done for years. There is nothing wrong with me and I have to keep reminding myself of that. I have certainly done nothing to deserve her making my Dad choose between his daughter and his wife. The conversation ended with me reminding him that under state law, he can't kick me out unless he wants to go through eviction proceedings. I never want it to come to that, I only mentioned it because I have a dog that I am responsible for and I will not let her live on the streets. And that's where we left it.

&amp;#x200B;

The past few weeks have made me realize that he will never stand up for me. He will never admit that there is nothing that made his wife hate me other than her own crazy. He will never admit that she 100% started this situation out of jealousy or something else when I was a kid. He will never admit it's not my fault (except the escalation that happened when I moved in, something I freely admit I 100% had a big part it). He will never leave her, even though in desperation I have asked him how he could love someone that hated his daughter so much. He won't even admit that my mother abused me for 10+ years, even though the state literally took his children away from her and the investigative report done by CPS was the most scathing, one-sided report that judge had ever seen. He will never love me enough to protect me, and it's devastating.

&amp;#x200B;

Thank you for reading this very long update. I am about 90% sure I have a place lined up to move within the next week. I will be leaving this house and never coming back unless their marriage ends. I still love my Dad but I am so disappointed in him. I'm not cutting contact out of anger, I'm cutting contact because it is too painful to have my Dad prove to me every single day that he doesn't care how bad anyone treats me.

&amp;#x200B;

tl;dr: stepmom has ruined my family and I don't think it is fixable."
5,"Me, pregnant with twins, 30F Husband 38M of 4 years asked me to sleep on the couch.


So my husband Aaron and I have been married for 4 years.

He has 3 kids from his previous marriage. I love those kids like they are my own. I'm currently 7 months pregnant with twins. 

I am on bedrest and primarily take care of his 8M son. Since I am still able to pick him up from school, grocery shop, and generally keep him entertained. 

His son, let's call him Bill, is a really good kid. We dont let him sleep in our bed during school nights. I've generally never really liked him sleeping in our bed, but also understand that he is only 8 and needs it sometimes. 

Tonight I have had an overall rough night physically. Being pregnant with 2 babies is ROUGH. And the 8 yr old had a rough day at school and I spent the afternoon with him playing, getting new toys for him, just being there.

I walk in after a long evening to Bill in our bed. My husband says ""his back hurts"" while nursing him with an ice pack. I asked if something happened, and my husband said no. In my mind I'm like what the hell?? My whole body hurts. And I knew Bill just wanted more time with his dad. 

I got a little emotional, and by that, I meant started to cry. Since I knew this meant a night of being kicked by an 8 yr old, not sleeping well, and feeling like shit while I'm already in pain. My husband asked if I could go sleep out on the couch.  So he could tend to Bill.

So here I am, on the couch, feeling like shit. But feeling like I cant say anything since I can't intrude on that relationship. What the hell do I do. 

Tldr: husband asked pregnant me to sleep on xpuxh."
6,"My mom [38f] stole a makeup set that my boyfriend [17m] gave me [16f]. She is convinced it is hers and I don't know what to do?


I'm sorry for any mistakes, I'm really mad and upset rn and I may not be thinking straight.

I've never really had good makeup. I usually get by okay with the cheap dollar store stuff, but Ive never really had anything ""good"". I mentioned it once to my boyfriend (of 5 months), not because I expected him to do anything about it, I was just talking in general.

My sweetheart of a boyfriend remembered that and a few days ago he randomly handed me a box with an absolutely amazing makeup set in it. it retails for something like $300 and I almost didn't want to take it because it seemed like too much. But my boyfriend just seemed happy I liked it and convinced me to take it.

I got to try it twice. The day I got it I tore into it as soon as I got home and tried some looks. I got to wear it one other time last weekend when I went on a date with the boyfriend and I got all dolled up for it. 

I intended to wear it last night for the same reason, but I went into the bathroom and opened the cabinet and my makeup set was gone! At first I immediately called my sister since we share the bathroom and I asked her where she put my makeup, but she told me she didn't touch it. 

After searching all over I still couldn't find it and asked my mom if she had seen a makeup set. She immediately told me she found one in my bathroom and took it ""back"" to hers. I asked her why she took my makeup set and she looked confused and told me it was hers.

I tried to tell her ""No, it was mine, Brian bought it for me."" But mom shook her head and said something like ""No 17 year old boy is buying something like that, it must be mine.""

I was getting upset and told her it was definitely, 100% mine and my boyfriend gave it to me,  but mom just told me that whether it was or wasn't doesn't matter because I don't need it.

She ignored me the rest of the night until she went to work. I tried going to get it myself but she left her door locked.

Finally today after I woke up I went downstairs and almost lost it because I'm about 99% sure she was wearing some of my makeup, and I told her again I want it back. She told me to drop it and she doesn't want to hear about it again.

I called my boyfriend to see if he had a receipt or something and he was *super* mad when I told him what happened, and he offered to come over and get it back, but I told him it wasn't a good idea to get in an argument now, so he is looking for a receipt to see if it helps.

What do I do? I want my make up back! It's the first decent set I've had, and it was a gift from someone I love! I swear my mom knows I'm telling the truth but just isn't budging for some reason. If she wanted to wear some I would have shared if she just asked, why did she have to take it?!?!

**TL;DR**: My boyfriend bought me a super nice makeup set as a gift. My mom took it and says it is hers, even though I'm pretty sure she knows it isn't. She won't listen to me and I just want my stuff back. Help?"
7,"My dad (55) quit his job thinking that he could find another one quickly, but has been declined every company he's applied for in the last 5 months. He's been sitting at home depressed and I don't know how to talk to him.


Because he had been working there for so long, the company offered him a package since they were downsizing so he took it. The package included a year of his salary, so he that he could find a job to make even more money during this period.

So far everywhere he's applied, he's been declined. Normal people would love to relax for a year and get paid for doing nothing, but he feels that work gives him a sense of purpose.

After being put down mentally by all these rejections, he's resorted to sitting on the couch all day looking at Facebook, playing games on his phone, or watching crappy shoot em up action movies. I can tell he's not enjoying his life. 

I really want to help, but things are weird right now. Him and I have a great relationship, but neither of us really talk about anything personal with eachother.

I am extremely busy with my classes, so I don't have time to hang out with him everyday. How do I let him know that I am there for him without directly saying it? What are some resources I can direct him to? 

Thanks

TLDR: Dad is sitting at home doing nothing all day. how do I let him know that I'm here for him without directly saying it?"
8,"How do I tell my narcissist mother (65F) that I (29F) already bought my wedding dress?


My fiance and I are getting married over the summer (we've been together 4 years). We decided on a very informal courthouse wedding and the two of us decided to elope/honeymoon internationally after. Well, this was heartbreaking to our parents and my mom threw a fit and tried to bargain and bully her way into getting her way. I gathered all of my strength from the spirit of past r/relationships posts and put my foot down. I had a change of heart a few months later though.  I have a good relationship with my MIL and I wanted her to be able to see us get married. Fiance and I decided to invite the parents for the weekend of our courthouse wedding. We planned some photos and simple dinner and THAT'S IT.

My mom of course took this as an invitation to start planning a wedding for us with a fancy cake and extravagant dinner. I just let her make these plans and not acknowledging them, instead reiterating my own. It seems to be working so far, except when it comes to the dress.

Backstory: My mom has always used money as a tool for emotional manipulation. Even when I was a child, she would spend her ""last dollars"" on something and bring it up FOREVER. She would talk about how she was poor and didn't have any clothes without holes in them because of me and my medical bills or things that I ""wanted"".  She would tell people on the street that she couldn't afford a haircut or dental work because of me. I separated myself from my parents financially as soon as I got to college and have a lot of debt as a result. I really couldn't handle the constant guilt trips even if it meant working full-time my freshman year. I stopped asking for anything at a young age and I still have a huge aversion to asking anyone for anything or receiving gifts. A few years ago, my parents took a page from Wesley Snipes' book and are now in a pretty bad financial situation. This makes my mom even more of a martyr when she sends me (unsolicited) gifts.

The first time I told her about the wedding, she said, ""I don't have any money, but the dress is MINE!"" meaning she would buy it for me. She talked up the experience and is clearly looking forward to shopping with me. I don't mind the shopping aspect, but I don't want her to make this all about the sacrifice she made for my ""special day"". I will literally have to hear about this for the rest of her life  -  ""Remember when I spent my last few pennies on your dress. I had to eat rice for a month afterward and I couldn't afford my medication, but you looked so lovely!"" I don't want to think about how much of a fucking narcissist my mom is every time I look at my wedding photos.

I started doing some preliminary online shopping and found sample dress on sale for $100 down from $500! I ordered it and it's arriving today. Assuming it fits and looks okay, this is the one. 

Here's the problem: My mom is coming to visit for the first time in a year and dress shopping is at the top of her list.

I'm so stressed out about what to say. I know I need to tell her that I bought a dress already, but I really just want to lie or avoid this whole situation. Anyone who's dealt with a narcissist knows how she's going to turn this around on me so I'm the asshole, and blow this whole thing out of proportion.  I never really developed a healthy relationship or mechanisms to deal with her and I just avoid situations like these to keep peace. My best idea so far was to tell her I found the dress at Goodwill. What's wrong with me???

I know I need to tell her, but what's the best way to approach this with the least amount of explosion? How do I stand up for myself without being a total dick? I believe in speaking my mind and doing what you want, I just don't want to deal with this fallout.

TL;DR:  I'm still a child at nearly 30 who is scared to tell her mom that she bought a dress."
9,"I [28M] don't want my MIL or my other in-laws to help with our baby anymore unless she changes. How do I convey this to me without causing a rift?


My husband [30M] and I [28M] have a 6 week old baby daughter. I am currently a stay at home dad and taking on most of the childcare. Occasionally my MIL has been helping me out but it has been causing a lot more stress than usual since she has been staying over and sleeping in our guest room.

Those past weeks we have been dealing a lot with baby colic. She has been difficult to comfort unless I hold her and she does get very upset when my MIL holds her. My MIL is a lovely woman but you can't explain that to a baby. I have been trying to explain to MIL that I appreciate her help around the house a lot, feeding times, laundry (baby's clothes). I have been telling her that but when it comes to the baby crying her head off I'd appreciate if she let's me hold her. When I tell her that, especially when the baby is crying and clearly wants me to hold her, my MIL gets visibly upset. Close to crying even because she thinks I'm pushing her granddaughter away from her. 

This mainly comes from her refusing to respect that I don't want her to kiss the baby on her lips, which is a disgusting habit my SIL also participates in. My MIL invites my SIL over as well to coo over the baby despite my daughter crying because of colic and overstimulation. She's not used to any of this. 

My husband is not backing me up on this because of course it's his mother so now I have to talk to her without causing a rift.

Tl;dr MIL and SIL do not respect boundaries regarding my daughter of 6 weeks. If this continues I'd rather exclude them for a while. How can we fix this?"
10,"I’ve (27/F) just learned that my friend (28/F) of nearly fifteen years is dating my ex (28/M) fully knowing that I’m still in love with him.


My ex and I were together for three years and recently broke up, about a month ago, due to reasons that I’m still trying to figure out. To my knowledge, there were no problems in the relationship, we were falling more in love with each other with each day and things were just ... good. But then he randomly sat me down one night after work and told me that he didn’t want to be with me anymore. I had no idea how to react. Part of me thought he was joking.

When I realized that he was serious about it, I asked if there was something that he wasn’t telling me. Before that we had been planning a three week trip to go see his parents on the other side of the country, which we did last year as well. It was his idea both times. When he explained to me that he just wasn’t in love with me anymore, I didn’t quite know how to process it, as the entire conversation had come out of nowhere for me. We hugged it out and he told me that he just needed a bit of time to himself to figure things out and that he didn’t want to drag me down with him whilst he went about it. He said, “I still love you as a person. I want to fall back in love with you romantically, too, but I have to work on myself before I can do that.” 

I had no idea what to say, so I just nodded and packed my things and stayed with a friend as it hurt too much to be in our apartment alone. I told him to stay there. 

Now a month later, he has moved out and into his own apartment, and we haven’t really talked much at all. I ignored one of his calls the other week because I felt I needed some distance in order to process things. He hasn’t called me since. The friend (32/M) that I had stayed with the night of the breakup has been a great help and has really been there for me in the best way. He went through a similar breakup not too long ago, through which I helped him, so now he’s just basically just doing the same for me, which I really appreciate.

Last night this friend and I were grabbing food with a coworker of his and whilst we were out, we saw my ex and my high school friend together. They were across the street, holding hands and laughing as if they had just gone on a date. At first I didn’t think it was them, but my other friend agreed that it definitely was. Then when they approached my ex’s car and kissed, it sunk in.

They were together. On a date. Probably fucking. 

I fell silent and just went home for the night. Initially I tried to go to sleep, but I couldn’t, so I stayed up most of the night looking through their IG posts and piecing together the fact that they’ve been hanging out at all the same places for weeks. That means that this isn’t new and that they’ve likely been seeing each other for longer than I would care to know.

In fact she’s probably the reason he broke up with me out of nowhere. And now they’re together as if it’s not a huge deal to anyone at all. This whole time I’ve been so upset and trying so hard to be supportive of my ex and the decision that he made in order to “figure shit out” when really he was just with her this entire time. 

It’s almost morning now and I’m trying to figure out what to do. They’re together now so obviously I have no intention of waiting for him like before or trying to get him back. But as far as my friend is concerned ... I’m truly in shock. She’s the last person in the world that I would ever have expected this from. Not really because we’ve known each other so long, just ... the fact that we’ve been through so much together and have always been that strong support system for each other. In fact after the breakup she was the first friend that I had called, but since she was away on a work trip (actually away) she couldn’t see me and we made plans to hang out when she was back. Work got in the way for me, so we actually didn’t end up getting together, but now I can see why it’s been so difficult. She’s with him and doesn’t want me to know. 

This is crazy. I really don’t know what I’m supposed to say to him when he picks up the rest of his things in a few days. Do I tell him that I know and ask for answers that I might not want to know? Do I ask someone else to be there to open the door and go away that day so I don’t have to see him? Do I just leave his things with a friend? 

I don’t know. 

Talk some sense into me. 

**tl;dr** The way things are looking, he likely broke up with me so he could be with her. Although they don’t know that I know, they will soon. Probably when he picks up the rest of his things from the apartment in a few days. Not sure what to say to him when that happens. I really don’t know how I’m even supposed to process this."
11,"My partner [28/M] of 7 years, deleted me [26/F] from various Instagram posts in order to continue to receive attention from someone else


Hello my friends near and far, I have never really used this before, so I apologize immensely for being unaware of certain posting criteria! I hope you are all doing well, and I thank you for taking the time to read this post!

I have been with my partner for 7 years, we initially met online, and after meeting in person a few times, and realizing our affection for one another, we found it promising to move in together. I moved from California to Pennsylvania to be with him throughout graduate school. All was seemingly well during this time. I have never really had any reason to not trust him. I encouraged him to very much so, to try his best to make friends, or to explore hobbies on his own outside of the various ones we share, because I have my own passions, and I found we connected most when we met in the middle through conversations about these passions, through the act of explaining or showcasing what we've taken in or learned. 

Throughout these 7 years, he has struggled with very low self esteem, and though I don't necessarily think of myself as the pillar of self love, the depth of mine doesn't reach the low perception of his self value. Because of this, he has seen and stopped seeing, both a counselor, and a therapist, and has been on medication to help for the last 6 months.

Things where seemingly well between us, and continued to be pretty fluid. We continued to share things, and take long walks, and where pretty open ended about where we stood in the relationship, if one was feeling a bit of an ebb, the other would pick up more of a share, and vice versa. 

However, things took a bit of a dip about 2 days ago, when I felt the ebb, and asked him about it. Initially, he said there was really nothing wrong, and perhaps I was just feeling this way because with our schedules we haven't been able to see one another for long periods of time like we are used to, which is true. But the feeling continued to irk me, and when I asked about it a second time, he confessed to me, he had begun talking to another girl from another country, via Instagram direct messages, and though things between she and him never crossed the boundaries of platonic friendship, he really loved the initial rush of someone asking him questions about his favorite movie, his favorite album, his favorite book, all things he and I already know very well about one another. I asked if he'd sent any selfies, or anything, risqué, and he said no, though I can't confirm, because he deleted the messages, a good deal of me believes him, because of how open he was about the initial conversations to begin with. We slept apart, and I just felt really confused the entire night, because I couldn't really resonate with wanting that sort of attention from someone else. If anything, his yearning for that type of attention, sort of hurt. It felt like I wasn't doing enough, or giving enough.

The next morning, though I don't have an Instagram, and am not on the app, I went to check his using the desktop version, and found that posts where he once called me 'the love of his life' or a specific post with a gift I gave him that once said 'greatest gift from the greatest girl' where still on his profile, but the words, 'girlfriend' or 'love of my life' where completed erased. With this realization, my confusion and hurt turned to very real heartache. I called him and asked if he had deleted these words from the specific posts, and with shame, he said yes he did. When I asked why, he said it was because he just didn't want the attention from the girl asking him about himself to be disrupted if she found out he was in a long term relationship. I guess this is where, I asked the obvious and questioned why someone who is just asking about your favorite books, movies, etc, would be driven away by the fact that you have a girlfriend. And he said he didn't know why he did it, and that it was a massive mistake.

At the risk of seeming toxic, and I will take full accountability for seeming so or being so, I asked him to please deactivate his Instagram for the time being while we sort through this, his twitter as well. He did, and though I was feeling a bit of relief about that, I couldn't help but feel a bit saddened that he didn't choose to do that on his own for the benefit of our relationship, he had to wait for me to ask. Which again, just made me feel like such a toxic and controlling partner. Two things I always strive to be so far from.

When he got home from work, we discussed everything at massive length, and he continued to swear up and down, that these conversations pertained strictly to music, movies, and books, and he didn't have interest in her, just interest in the initial rush of the attention he was receiving. We read a few articles, and he broke things down to me as his self esteem has never been lower, despite his career as a doctor being at a high, and his finances in order, he felt things with his music weren't taking off, and with that came a feeling that he wasn't special, and it was nice for someone to make him feel that way. I felt shame and asked him if I wasn't doing enough or giving enough to him to make him feel that way, he said, I defiantly was, but my love, and attention and affection, became a pillar he could rely on, and got used to, so with new attention came a rush, and he liked that. 

I asked him if he wanted to be single, and find that rush in dating new people, and he kept insisting that that's so far from what he wants. He wants to remain a couple, and do all he can to work on these things together. Though I can't help but correlate that feeling he enjoys with the feeling of a first date. Which hurts of course. I told him I didn't really see how we could move past this because there was nothing much for me to make an attempt to work on moving forward. This seems to be a self stemming problem, that I emphasize with, but just don't want to be on the receiving end of the counter effects. 

So though it is incredibly uneasy to begin to think of how difficult it'll be to begin again, it is just as difficult to think about how difficult it would be to stay and try to rebuild back up an issue that I feel like just a bystander when it comes to. 

This has all been very painful and if this comes to an end I just want it to be as civil and as possible. He deserves to love himself, but not at the expense of the love we have between us. I deserve love that is stable and comforting, and not laced with newfound paranoia. 

Despite this all, my heart is still very much in this of course, and he has been very vocal about how it was just one mistake, nothing happened, we can work through this, etc. And I secretly keep hoping he will make a step, any step really, to showcase these words and implement action, seek a new therapist, find the two of us a relationship counselor, buy a book on self help or on how couple conquer affairs, anything, anything at all, without me having to be the one to ask him. I just want him to have that yearning that he continues to say he has, but instead of saying it, I was him to show me. 

Do you think that makes me irrational or just plain dumb? I believe to be in a state where I can handle either answer. Or something completely different just the same!

Do you all think I'm blowing something completely out of proportion? Given how this was an exchange of conversation between him and another girl for just a few days, and his erasure of me on his profile was only for about 2 days? 

Alas, we have come to the very end of this post, if you've made it, I can not thank you enough for giving me your time, if you take the time to post, I can not thank you enough for giving me your efforts. This has been a first in this relationship, this has been a first in my life truthfully, and throughout writing this I just felt completely vulnerable and isolated. So, if you've given me your time, thank you, thank you, thank you! I hope what happened to me, doesn't happen to you, and wish you all things gracious and good and completely fulfilling my friends! Best of luck, and all of my love and gratitude.

TL;DR I've been in a relationship for 7 years, my partner recently and unexpectedly kept posts on Instagram that showcased us as a couple but deleted the words beneath them that included the words 'love of my life' and 'girlfriend' in order to continue to receive attention from another girl who lives in another country, who he says he shared a platonic relationship with via Instagram direct messages, and really only enjoyed the aspects of her asking him questions about his favorite things and giving him validation. He says he only erased those specific words in order to keep the flow of validation coming. He doesn't want to end things or see other people, I am a bit unsure about where to go or what to do."
12,"My [33m] coworker [20s?F] won't stop doing the pouty/babytalk voice and it is driving me insane.


Sorry for the throwaway.

I have a coworker who I'll call Anna. Anna works in a semi-clerical role. She is, from all reports, fine at her job.

Anna comes from a culture in which traditional gender roles are still enforced pretty strongly. She will openly say ""I can just start crying when I walk in and they'll help me, because I'm a girl!"" She complains at work when her first dates don't bring her flowers. Etc etc - you know what I'm getting at.

The problem is: when she runs into an issue, she will start complaining in the ""pitiful"" voice. *What should I doooooo :( :( :(*. And she ONLY does this when she's talking to men - when she speaks to other women, she cleans her speech up.

It drives me fucking bonkers. I know what she's doing. She's trying to ask for help without actually asking for help. She is trying to play on my BIG STRONG PROTECTOR MAN role. 

Any way I've thought to address this with her would make me sound like an asshole. And I recognize that this is cultural, too, this is the way that she was raised.

Is there any way for me to bring this up safely?

tl;dr: coworker does babyvoice when she hits minor roadblocks."
13,"My(27M) wife (25F) is very unhappy and asks me to get rid of or stop doing the things I love to make her happy but it's never enough.


I have no friends or family so I created an account to ask for help. 

My wife and I have been together for 5 years married for 4, she had a bad marriage before me and had a child. I had no problem stepping up to the plate to help her raise her child (the father wants nothing to do with my wife or his kid)

To the point, I had 2 friends that I've had since I was 16, they were both female and I had dated one of them for 4 years but we split up agreeing that we made better friends then an actual couple. Which never happens in real life apparently. Shes always been my go for advice and I made our friendship 100% transparent for my wife when we first met and never hid anything. Out of habit my friend and I still said we loved each other but more if a platonic love. We both loved our current partners and never wanted anything between each other. However after a few years this took a toll on my wife and she asked me to stop telling her that I loved her. So I explained this to my friend and she said she understood and would have no problem doing so. 

Another month or so I still have 100% transparency with my wife as to make her feel comfortable. I got deployed and my friend had just had her baby and asked me if I wanted to facetime to see her. I said yes naturally happy for her and her husband. After a nice chat and meeting her new son. I got a call from my wife a few days later asking if I had talked to her kn facetime. I told her that I had and why, also telling her what we had discussed. My wife then didnt talk to me the rest of my deployment. When I got home I explained that I was sorry it hurt her feelings and wanted to make things better. She told me to never talk to her again. I tried to explain that its was just a friendship and that neither of us wanted a relationship. 

My wife took it upon herself to call her and tell her that if she didnt stop talking to me forever that she would tell my friends husband that we were having an affair.

She did not tell me any of this. I quickly noticed she had blocked me on everything, including my number. I had no idea what happened so I confronted my wife and she told me that she was certain I was cheating on her and that my friend and I were having an affair. She then told me that she had called her and only asked her to not talk to me anymore. I was slightly upset but stood by her decision and held no grudge. 

I feel like this event led to the breakdown of everything. She started to have no trust in anything I did, constantly going through my phone, and she would constantly lock her phone, or lock herself in the bathroom talking to someone on the phone. 

She started blaming her job for her unhappiness, I told her that I could pull extra hours at work if she wanted to quit to find a new one. She quickly quit her job and made no attempt to find work agajn.

I was enlisted at the time. She said she hated that I was gone all the time so I offered to go reserves to be with her more. She said that would fix it. So I got a civilian job that paid decent but we had to move. 

The job is stressful and I'm not very fond of being a civilian. She has now come to the conclusion that I need to get out of the military and quit my civilian job and we to move again and that's the only way she'll be happy. 

I feel like I've given up everything for her to be happy, I'm trying to show her the logic that there is no way for us to survive if neither of us work.

I love my wife and dont want a divorce but I feel like she will never be happy and I'm not sure how to fix it. She blames everything on me and says that I'd be happier with someone else or says shes leaving again.

I'm currently deployed again and the last week I was home she wouldn't talk to me or spend time with me and our daughter. She would lock herself in the bedroom all day. Then at night she would call me names and say I dont care about her and I never spend time with her. 

Im very confused because I'm not the best with emotions, I'm a logical man and I see no logical answer here.

Any thoughts or advice would be great. Thank you!

TL:DR My wife is unhappy and refuses to do anything about it. She blames all of these problems on me, yet refuses to even let me try. She is constantly going through my phone or asking me if I'm cheating. She keeps asking me to give up the things I love in an attempt to make her happy"
14,"Husband (37M) keeps making excuses as to why he can't come or take (3M) to the doctor and just buries his head in the sand and pretends every thing is fine.


**TL;DR: Husband buries his head in the sand and pretends everything is fine.**

Every 2 or 3 weeks I need to take my son to the doctor to do some tests to make sure his heart is doing okay. They do all these tests and give a me prescription for a refill of the medicine I need to make sure he takes. I don't have a problem doing it, obviously. He needs to get older before they can really do anything significant to treat him. 

I'm just mentally exhausted because I feel like I am the only one taking this seriously. My husband. I really think I'm starting to hate him. I'm so over this fucking attitude he has where he wants to bury his head in the sand and pretend everything is fine. My husband wants to live in this reality where there is nothing wrong with our son. It was a fight to get him to come to the doctor to learn what to do incase of emergency. Sometimes our son complains about the medicine. My husband feels bad for him and says one night off won't hurt, but then I'm the idiot who has to fight with a three year old to take the medicine after daddy said no. He's stopped doing because I warned him to stop telling that to our kid. 

Please give me some advice."
15,"My (25F) friend (26F) is mad because I didn't tell her I saw her dad at the hospital


 I volunteer at my local hospital as a therapy dog handler. My dog and I visit patient rooms, waiting rooms, etc., to visit and give people a little distraction/comfort/pick-me-up/whatever they need. Even as a volunteer, I got pretty extensive training on policies/procedures, including HIPAA/privacy-related training. Since this is the local hospital of my hometown where I've lived for 15 years, I sometimes see people I know there. I never go out of my way to avoid people I know, but I never ask why they're there and I certainly never mention it to anyone else that I saw them at the hospital.

The other day, I saw my best friend's dad there as a patient. I was pretty surprised because she didn't mention anything to me about her dad being in the hospital (she and I are extremely close and talk on a daily basis, and she is close with her parents. We all live in the same small town). I treated him as anyone else. He saw me, pet my dog, asked me about work/my parents/etc, and I went on my way. I didn't even think about telling my friend that I saw her dad there, because, well, privacy. He could have been there for a sensitive issue and didn't want his daughter to know. Anyway, point is, it wasn't even a moral dilemma about whether to mention it to her. I knew I wouldn't.

Fast forward a few days and I get a text from her asking ""were you going to tell me you saw my dad in the hospital?"" I said something ""oh did he mention he saw me?"" And, well, she was pissed. She went off on me, calling me a ""stickler"" and saying that if the roles were reversed she wouldn't have hesitated to tell me. I tried to explain to her that it wasn't my place to tell her, and that doing so would be a violation of hospital policy and I believe even federal law. I didn't know why he was in there or whether he wanted his daughter to know, so I wasn't going to say anything.

Anyway, I figured maybe she was in shock/upset about her dad and was displacing her emotions onto me, which was fine. But it's been days and she's still barely talking to me. I don't know what to say to communicate to her that I love and care for her, but I'm not going to violate someone else's privacy to give her information.

TL;DR: I saw my friend's dad in the hospital, I didn't tell her for the sake of his privacy, and now she is irrationally angry at me."
16,"My father[70M] disowned me[41M] last weekend


 

This isn't like a lot of disowning stories. I'm not young, I'm not gay, and my father isn't a bigot.

In summer 2017, my 68 year old father married a new wife (aprox his age).

This Easter weekend was his 70th birthday. I live over 500 miles away, so I booked plane tickets for myself, my girlfriend of 3 years, and her 2 kids (whom I get along with amazingly well and love to death), and we all went over to his place to celebrate his birthday.

Every single time I've had dinner with him and his wife, she has invariably talked about money. I always thought it was creepy and never believed the things she said, but I think now I get it. As we finished dinner and partook in some desert, my dad's new wife announced to me that they'd decided that they were going to skip the kids, and give all of their inheritance to their grandkids. Just like that.

My father has 2 sons, myself and my brother, and his wife has one daughter. My brother has 2 kids, her daughter has one, and I have none.

You might see where this is going. I was being cut out. I was told that I was ""entitled to nothing"" and that ""it is what it is"". The person doing the telling was not my dad though, but rather his wife. My dad just sat in silence. The words ""silence is deafening"" come to mind.

I'm hurt beyond measure that my father would disown me. It feels like my last parent (my mother died in 2017) has broken up with me, and that I am alone. All I've ever wanted was his respect and pride, but none of my accomplishments have ever impressed him (I spearhead multi-million dollar projects that bring entertainment to thousands). I also really don't need the money, but I'm disgusted that everyone gets a piece except me. I'm destroyed that for some reason, I don't measure up. It really isn't the money, it's what the money represents.

I know very well that I am not allowed to dictate what my father should do with his will/money. But I do plan to ask... if **her** daughter had not had kids (by choice or by forces outside of her control) if his wife would disown **her** own daughter? 

I know the answer already, as do you. Which is just another reason why it hurts so much.

I don't know what to think, I don't know what to do, and I'm just looking for feedback. I want to tell them off and cut them out - but I love my father and wouldn't want to end my relationship with him. But at the same time, what he's done (or allowed to be done) just seems so wrong... I would never in a million years do something like this to my son. I really don't know what to think. Help me reddit.

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR: I was disowned by my father last weekend. His wife has managed to cut me out so she can cut herself and her daughter a larger slice of my dad's pie. I'm devastated, heartbroken and angry, but I don't know what to do next."
17,"A friend [29M] has made a serious accusation against my [27M] girlfriend [26F]


I don't know what to think. The situation is that a buddy I've known for a few years who is dating another friend of mine has informed me that my girlfriend that I've known for 8 months is lying about her occupation. He is an EMT and she claims to be a nurse at a certain hospital in our city. EMT buddy swears up and down there is no way she works there. 

This is really shocking to me. She's in scrubs all of the time, I've picked her up from the hospital she claims to work at, she has medical books all over her apartment etcetera. 

EMT buddy and my girlfriend have only met once on a double date with my other friend. They did talk shop a little bit and he's basing this accusation on that one conversation. He told me he would bet money she had never stepped foot on the ward she claims to work in. For reference, she says she's a psych nurse at this prestigious hospital and EMT buddy asked her which unit she worked on. Apparently there are two at this hospital, the ""East"" and ""West"" unit. He tested her by asking ""do you work on ""North"" or ""south"" and she said, ""north"" and that she referred to patients being violent as a ""code grey"" and that is not the terminology used at that hospital. There were more small, technical details he claimed she got wrong like their nurse's stations being open and not enclosed spaces. Things like that.

On one hand, why would she lie about being a nurse? But also what does he gain from lying about her lying about being a nurse? I don't know jack about the medical profession, to be frank. This whole thing makes me feel crazy. 

How do I even bring this up? 

TLDR EMT friend has called out my girlfriend as pretending to be a nurse."
18,"I [27F] feel like I’m sacrificing my financial wellbeing for my boyfriend [28M]; how do I bring this up to him?


I’ve been with my boyfriend for 3 years, and we have lived together for 1.5 years.

&amp;#x200B;

We live in the heart of a very expensive metro area so he can be close to his well-paying job. That’s literally the only reason we are here.

&amp;#x200B;

I freelance from home, and could do it from anywhere (like somewhere where the cost of living isn’t so damn high). I love what I do and do okay for myself, but for this area, my salary allows me to barely scrape by. 

&amp;#x200B;

If I weren’t with him, I’d most definitely move and be much more financially stable. I’m kind of a math nerd, so I’ve got the numbers down.

&amp;#x200B;

Right now, over 50% of my income gets put toward rent. Add on all my other expenses and shit is TIGHT around here. I haven’t bought anything for myself, like books, clothes, make-up, whatever, in a looooong time. I have about $35 in spending money each week, and pretty much all of that goes toward food (more on that later). 

&amp;#x200B;

My boyfriend, on the other hand, makes about double my salary. I’ve watched as he’s paid off his credit card debt and most of his car loan, and has started funding his 401K. I’m proud of him and am glad he’s able to do that.

In comparison to my measly $35 per week in spending money, he has about $300 per week to blow. That money will go toward food, and the rest goes towards video games, entertainment, fantasy sports, beer…in other words, fun stuff.

Again, I’m glad he’s able to do that.

&amp;#x200B;

Sometimes he will complain about how money is going to be tight for him until his next paycheck, because he only has $200 left. I have to laugh because I’m working with about 15% of that amount every week.

&amp;#x200B;

We split everything 50/50: rent, utilities, any vacations we take, food on the rare occasion that we go out, groceries.

&amp;#x200B;

Speaking of groceries and our meals. I do all of the cooking while he relaxes and does something fun. He will offer to help, but he’s not particularly talented in the kitchen, so it’s easier if I just do it all.

&amp;#x200B;

Recently, without knowing, I shorted him on our 50/50 grocery payment by maybe $10. He kind of threw it in my face during an argument.

&amp;#x200B;

Not only did I feel it was super rude of him to do that, but if he wants to be petty, I could be petty too. I could say I shouldn’t have to pay exactly 50/50 since A) I am the one who cooks and B) he eats more than I do, not to mention C) he makes way more money than I do.

&amp;#x200B;

Most of the time if I’m talking about how tight my financial situation is, he’ll be empathetic. But a few times, he’s said how I should “just” raise my freelance rates, like it’s that simple. Sometimes, he tells me how he lives paycheck to paycheck too, but I just don’t feel like he understands how different our situations are.

&amp;#x200B;

I worry that he thinks less of me because my income level isn’t more equal to his, and end up with a lot of insecure feelings. 

&amp;#x200B;

A couple people have mentioned that instead of splitting expenses 50/50, we should split expenses more proportionally to our income. I’ve been hesitant to bring this up to him for a lot of reasons. The first being I almost feel guilty that I’m not making more. I feel like I’m not pulling my weight and don’t want him to resent me for that. I don’t truly believe it’s fair for him to have to pay more just because I didn’t choose a higher-paying career (but at the same time, it’s not fair to me to have to commit to living in an expensive area just so he can be here for work, so maybe it balances out).

&amp;#x200B;

Secondly, I feel like if he’s being petty about less than $10, he isn’t going to agree to paying more than his equal share of expenses.

&amp;#x200B;

Besides this, the relationship is pretty great, overall I am happy and have a good life here but I think the financial burden dulls everything for me. I don’t want to break up with him, but sometimes it’s so tempting knowing that if I walked away from this, I could pay off ALL of my debt within 1.5 years and actually start thriving again. 

&amp;#x200B;

I guess I am just looking for some input here. I’m not sure how to even start this conversation, especially when he has nickel-and-dimed me before. Any advice?

&amp;#x200B;

Tl;dr Boyfriend makes double what I do but we split everything 50/50. How do I have a conversation with him about this when he is petty about money?"
19,"Boyfriend (22m) and I (25f) are arguing about me openly wearing knockoff designer goods in public



I lived for a year in a city where it is very easy to find knockoff designer goods, and nice ones too. Even though the bag or shoes is fake, they're real leather and well constructed. Or even if the coat is a knockoff it's well tailored and a nice durable coat that will last for years. In that city, for every one person wearing real designer stuff, two were wearing knockoffs.

I'm not ashamed of that. Sometimes I like the style of a piece but there's no way I'd spend 1000+ bucks on it. So I have some purses, shoes, coats, and miscellaneous clothes that are knockoffs of designer things. I don't go for stuff with big obvious branding, like bags stamped all over with monograms, I think those are tacky. If the stuff I buy has any faked labels at all, they're small and subtle. I don't buy stuff so I can pretend to afford Gucci, I just buy classic understated styles that I like but I don't want to spend thousands on. I want to look stylish without breaking the bank.

Anyway, now I live in a smaller Midwestern city with my boyfriend Daniel. We're both engineers, working at different companies but in the same general social circle because it's a small town. We often go out after work with our work friends. Sometimes his group, sometimes my group, sometimes both groups end up merging because there's one bar we all like a lot.

And on Thursday, we were out with a group of work friends from both of our offices. One of my boyfriend's coworkers was making jokes about how my boyfriend had probably blown his whole bonus on the handbag I was carrying, and that's why he was still dressed like a slob. (This guy knew what it was because he had apparently bought his girlfriend a real one) 

My boyfriend said that I bought all my stuff on my own, he's no sucker.

And I felt like he was making me out to be some idiot who would spend thousands on a bag, so I said ""No way I'd spent that either, I bought this off a dude in an alley in (old city), what kind of dumbass do you take me for!"" 

The group we were with laughed at that, and one of my friends from my job asked if all the nice stuff I wear is fake, and I said ""fuck yeah it is, I think it's ridiculous to drop thousands on something that's just priced for the name.""

And my friend was surprised, he'd always thought fakes would look more fake and tacky, but I'd always been the best dressed person in the office. I made some joke about that being a low bar because of them all, and the topic was dropped.

I had the impression from that conversation that nobody was put off by what I said. It's a group of engineers tbh, practical types who probably respect NOT blowing your paycheck on designer shit more than they respect status symbols. One of my other coworkers actually told me later that he ought to take his wife to (my old city) to save some money on gifts for her!

But last night after we went home, my boyfriend told me that he was humiliated by how I bragged to everyone about all my bags and stuff were fake. And that he didn't want me wearing that stuff around him again because it'd be embarrassing being out with someone who everyone knows is wearing knockoffs.

I told him he was being silly, a bag's a bag, and if it looked cute back when only he and I knew it wasn't real... It still looks cute. And it still works fine for what it is. And he was obviously the only one who cared about status symbols, nobody else there was judging me.

When I said that, he told me I was being super socially oblivious.

I don't think I was but I guess there's no way to know that impartially...

So, can I have advice? I don't want to replace many of my clothes and accessories, but my boyfriend doesn't want me wearing them out in public now that the ""secret"" that they're fake is out.

tldr; I told a group of work friends that my designer bags and clothes are all fake. My boyfriend is very embarrassed, which I think is an overreaction because I'm not ashamed. How do I handle this in the future?"
20,"I [17M] feel ashamed that I'm submissive in my relationship with my girlfriend [18F]


My girlfriend is definitely the one in charge and the dominant one in our relationship. She usually plans where we go on dates and stuff and what movies we see. When we spend time together, I usually rest my head on her shoulder or on her boobs and she strokes my hair. When we walk around, she always puts her arm around my neck and she's usually the one who initiates kissing. She's pushed me against a wall and started kissing me a few times and sat on my lap, grabbed my face and kissed me to seduce me, too. I really really like that she's dominant and in control, but I feel shame for liking it at the same time. I feel like I'm supposed to do the things she does since I'm the guy. My friends also tease me and stuff when they see me laying on her shoulder and stuff and it makes me feel so embarrassed. What can I do?

&amp;#x200B;

\--

tl;dr: I feel embarrassed for liking that my gf is dominant and in charge"
21,"Bad situation with my Husband (35M) and Cousin (20F)


I am 35F. Yesterday my cousin (20F) texted that she needed to take to me. We met up and she was very teary. She told me that my husband, who is not employed and is home while I was at work, went to her house. One of her brothers apparently didn't lock the door when he left in the morning. My husband went in, then into her bedroom where she was sleeping and sat on her bed. She woke up to him looking at her. He started asking her if she wanted a massage, etc. She was totally freaked out, of course, and told him to leave. He did, she locked all the doors then got dressed and left her house to go somewhere safe. Then she texted me when she knew I would be off work to tell me.

I 100% believe her. I went home and confronted my husband. He said it was true but she ""overdramatized"" it. BS. I am devastated.  We have had our problems and he has down some shitty things to me but this is the worst. It didn't just hurt me, it hurt a family member. We have been together 5 years and thus he has known her since she was 15. She must have been terrified. He said he will apologize but I don't think an apology can fix this. Tell me Reddit, is this divorce time?

**TL;DR:** husband acted inappropriately with adult niece, is it possible to come back from this?"
22,"Boyfriend (24M) booked a week long holiday with a female friend without warning me


Hi all,

me and my bf are in a long distance relationship for nearly 3 years. A little over a month ago we broke up because of some issues we'd been having, but during that time we were speaking nearly every day. At the time of being broken up, he mentioned a female friend he'd known for years (but in the 3 years never mentioned) wanted to go for summer vacation to Italy. He said he might go with her. As he was single at the time, I felt I  couldn't really object so I didn't say anything.

Not long after that we decided to give our relationship another chance. He hasn't mentioned the friend/trip since so I had forgotten about it completely. Yesterday, he told me he saw her at an Easter lunch his friend had hosted. So they had booked the holiday, all inclusive for a week, just the two of them. 

When he told me I felt a mix of shock, anger and sadness.. First of all, I know he doesn't need my permission to spend time and money that he works for, for whatever he wants.. but it feels like a stab in the back to not consult such a thing with me. Second of all, the trip is during my birthday and by going on it we won't see eachother from May until July  because he has to work the rest June. Plus I feel really uncomfrotable about him going to a trip with a woman I'd never heard about alone. What was he thinking?? 

His excuses were that it's a family friend who feels like a sister to him and that it's normal to go on trips with friends. And he said yes, I should have spoken about it with you but now it's all booked so there's nothing I can do... 

I know he can't take his actions back and I' m not even sure for what answer I'm looking on here, just some opinions on what I should do next... I don't want to break up with him or anything like that, but my feelings are hurt.

TL;DR Boyfriend of 3 years booked a holiday with a female friend without speaking to me about it, the result is not seeing me for two months."
23,"My (32F) Husband (33M) Drove Around Drunk and I Think I'm Done (Together Ten Years)


Hey guys I'll try to make this as short as possible. I love my husband, we have so much in common, same sense of humour, we get along so well and have that very special connection that I've always dreamed of. I have never loved anyone as much as I love him. We share a very deep connection and this connection has kept me around when really, I would have left anyone else if they had pulled the shit he's pulled.  


He's bipolar and has been unmedicated most of his life. Finally last year I was done with his untreated mental illness and the hell it put me through and I left to my mothers and started planning my life without him. He promised to get on meds, and he did, and it helped. He is on Seroquil 200mg. He is on a wait list to see a psychiatrist. He has also quit smoking pot, which was making him lazy and stupid. He used to have a bad alcohol problem but he has (MOSTLY) got that under control.  


He's drank and drove randomly throughout our relationship. It is something I find disgusting, just a despicable thing to do, a selfish, idiotic, stupid thing to do. I am completely against drinking and driving.

I had told my husband that after the last time this happened (maybe 2 years ago?) that if this ever happened again, I was leaving. I even repeated this to him in the last few weeks, like, hey dude just reminding you there's no turning back if you do this, kinda thing.

Well... last week he was off work super early so he went into town (we live in the country) to pick up a few things. He called me a couple hours into this trip and was clearly slurring his words. I told him to pull over and stop driving, that I was going to figure out what to do (I was at work and 1.5 hours away). He denied it and said he was fine. He didn't answer me for awhile but when he finally did he was HAMMERED. He forgot that he had went to a store and bought stuff, he was like ""Should I go pick up xx"" and I was like wtf you went to get it already, ITS IN YOUR BACKSEAT!? I was terrified. I told him DO NOT DRIVE. Park the car and walk to the nearest restaurant and sober up while I figure out what to do. He hung up then texted me that he was just confused and he was fine. I again repeated DO NOT DRIVE OR I WILL CALL THE COPS ON YOU. He ignored me. I made an anonymous report of a car matching his description driving erratically in the approx area I knew him to be in, but they didn't find him. When he showed up at home he was clearly intoxicated. I had ran out and bought a BAC tester thing and it said he was at least at 0.08% BAC or higher, as thats as high as the test will go.

&amp;#x200B;

Now I've told him multiple times I was leaving if this happened. He did it. So I am making my plans to leave. He has not mentioned what happened at all... which is typical for him. He is going above and beyond to do things around the house and such, blah blah blah. Nothing makes up for what he did.

  
Him leaving leaves me in a clusterfuck, as we live on a farm and I'm going to have to figure everything out on my own now, probably having to pay for farmhand help as there is a lot I can't do (I have physical limitations). It has been nearly a week and he's said nothing. I'm waiting until I am 10000% sure to tell him its over. I know he will give me trouble and not want to leave. I can't leave the property as there are animals that require care and I would not trust him to care for them all without my guidance.

&amp;#x200B;

Is there anyway to save this marriage? I love him but I don't see how I can ever trust him. Yes, he has come a very long way from the absolute shitbag he used to be, but he is still so stupid and selfish that he will put other peoples lives at risk for what? To get drunk and drive around? What the actual eff.

  
We have done couples counselling but the counsellor was a whackadoodle and we stopped seeing her. I know my husband would go to therapy on his own if I asked him to but I do not believe he would be honest with the therapist.    


TLDR: Husband drove drunk. I can't forgive his actions and can't trust him. I am planning on leaving. Is there any way our relationship could be salvageable? I love him and it'll kill me to leave him, but I can't trust him."
24,"My [23F] bf [26M] of 4 years keeps making jokes using my insecurities, including calling me fat when I've just reached my ideal weight goal


I don't really know where to begin, our entire relationship has been an up and down roller coaster. Its our first relationship and neither of us are perfect but we love each other and have been loyal towards one another through out. I thought this was enough however now I don't know. 

&amp;#x200B;

One of our issues is that Jack loves to make jokes at other peoples expense. He on the other hand would tell you that I'm too sensitive and have no sense of humour. 

&amp;#x200B;

Ive tried telling him in the past not to joke on things he knows Im self conscious over but he does them regardless. He apologizes and promises to not do it again but then will complain that hes feeling like hes walking on eggshells and that I should know by now not to take his words too serious. 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Around 6 months ago we started exercising together and have changed our lifestyles to be more healthy. Its been going pretty great and we've both lost some weight.

  
I weighed myself yesterday and have finally reached my goal. I was so happy that I shared it with Jack and he starts telling me that I need to lose some more weight (I'm 55kg) and that my goal was set at an easy level. Later on he starts calling me fatso and starts making jokes about my weight, once again telling me that my goal and weight loss wasn't good enough and that I need to lose some more. 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Ive had body image issues all my life. I had an eating disorder as well which he knows about but I don't think he understands how bad it was. Either way Ive made it clear in the past that I did not want negative comments about this as Im quite self conscious. He knew this and yet decided to make jokes about it. 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

He claims he wasnt thinking straight and that I should know he doesnt think I'm fat and made comments along the lines of ""youre not fat, you know that, why are you offended at these jokes"" 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

I completely lost it on him and que massive argument. He apologizes but then tells me ""I apologized what else do you want from me"" he makes the some promises that he wont do it again but I don't believe him. And I don't know what he can do to change that. 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

To make things worse, he got sick of talking about this that he decided to hang up and refused to talk further about it (something which he does regularly, we've also had issues about this and hes promised not to do this but did it yet again) 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

I don't know what to make of this. I don't know how to move forwards. 

&amp;#x200B;

I havent been in any other relationships, and I want to know if this is normal in long term relationships. Do you just get use to calling each other names and it becomes normal somehow?. Am I being too sensitive ?  


&amp;#x200B;

tl;dr: I can't take personal jokes that fire my insecurities and bf despite his promises to do better constantly makes them. Including calling me fat after reaching a weight goal and I don't know what is normal"
25,"My (23F) sister (17F) has recently started obsessively following chronically ill YouTubers and I’m worried for her mental health.


Finally made my first Reddit account after years of lurking. I’m kind of the black sheep of my family—I came out as a lesbian at 18 and was promptly given 2 months to move out. I did, then never looked back. It’s only within the last year that my mom has reached out to me to attempt to repair our relationship and I’ve been spending a lot of time with family since. I’ve also been disabled my entire life, probably due to some choices my mother made while pregnant. Basically: there’s some bad blood between us. 

My little sister has always been the golden child. She does well academically, plays sports. She rules at soccer. I’m pretty proud of her drive to do things and in this whole situation, I’ve been most excited to get to know her again. But I do think as college approaches and she has to play witness to our family stuff getting worked out, she’s been getting stressed in ways she isn’t voicing. 

My sister loves YouTubers. She’s pretty big on Internet “celebrities” and she likes Good Mythical Morning a lot. But she’s recently started following A LOT of chronic illness vloggers and recently, started imitating them. When she gets any kind of injury (bruise, scrape!) she will extensively document it on social media. She’s starting tagging her Instagram photos with #EDS (which she does not have, nor has she seen a doctor for complications similar to it) and joined a bunch of EDS support groups on Facebook. I’ve also noticed she follows some eating disorder accounts and, in a public group, made some kind of comment on a post about how she thought a nasal feeding tube would “help” but “[her] mom was against the idea.”

Again: as far as I know, she has not spoken to our mom about any of this. She has not been to a doctor for any issues that could be chronic illness. 

My sister doesn’t have my mom added on Facebook and I doubt she’s monitoring her Instagram. These are all things I’ve just noticed because being disabled, I’m semi-familiar with them. My mom HAS noticed she’s been moodier recently, but that seems to be it. I’m getting worried, especially about the eating disorder accounts she follows. I’m really worried my new relationship with her &amp; my mom has been detrimental in some way, or maybe she’s had some kind of long-standing anxiety/depression issue that she’s tried to hide from everyone. 

I’m also not sure how to mention it to my mom, who likes her a lot more than she likes me. I’m even less sure how taking it to my sister directly would go. Is this something I just need to keep an eye on and leave until it gets worse? Do people grow out of this kind of thing? Is she going to level out once there’s more adult things going on in her life and she has to be independent? I’m at a loss. Please help.

TL;DR: Recently started fixing my bad relationship with my mom only to discover my teenage sister is pretending to have a disability she doesn’t have online. She also might have an eating disorder. I don’t know how concerned I should be, who to tell or how I should be telling them."
26,"My (15M) dad (48M) is in a mental institution and my mom (36F) is in and out of rehab. I don't know what to do anymore.


Two years ago my dad was arrested for crime. I don't really want to say what he did, because everytime I do, it's all people want to talk about. All you need to know is that he was arrested and charged. He was found guilty and mentally unstable. They didn't send him to a traditional jail. They sent him to this mental institution place which is just a fancy word for a jail. I don't know. I've heard other members of my family say my dad is criminally insane. That may be true. It's kinda hard to dispute. I don't know. 

Way before this when I was ten. My school called CPS on my parents. They deemed both my parents unfit and I was put with my cousin (34M), Harry and his wife. That really sent my mom down this drug use again. She's been and out of rehab for years. She goes in. Gets clean and then fucking goes right back to the needle. I don't know. I just heard last night she was picked up by the cops for public intoxication. She now has an drunk problem as if we didn't have enough problems she goes to that now. Well fucking done. 

I've been feeling like hell ever since the weekend. One of Harry's work friends didn't know who I was. He asked me what my parents did when I told him I was Harry's cousin. What do you say? My mom's a drug addict and my dad's locked up in crazy jail? I didn't know what to say and Harry to step in to pull my ass out of the fire. 


**TL;DR: I don't know what to do about my parents anymore. Dad's considered crazy in jail, and mom gets addicted to every substance under the sun. I don't live with them, but it's just fucking depressing.**"
27,"My [27F] boyfriend [27m] won’t stop talking to the woman he cheated on me with.


My boyfriend and I have been together some time over a year. Maybe half way through the relationship he cheated on me with him ex girlfriend. Even before he cheated I saw messages between them that were inappropriate, as in them discussing their relationship and being together. He admitted to me that he was still in love with her and we agreed that he would cut communication. Well he didn’t and some month after that conversation he cheated on me with her. Not only physically but he would send her flowers, gifts and they were discussing actually being together.

I found out about the cheating some months after it happened. And he seemed genuinely sorry about the situation and stated he wanted to be with me. We have been working to make the relationship better and I have been working to forgive him which has been hard but every few months, it’s seems I find out he reaches out to her in some way. I think he’s still in love with her. He says he communicates with her because she has always been an important part of his life and he likes to make sure he was okay. But I feel after he crossed the line with cheating he lost the chance to be just friends with her.

Am I wasting my time being with him? Should I just let it go? Am I wrong for asking him to cut off someone who has been in his life before me?

TDLR: boyfriend cheated on me with ex and he keeps communicating with her after I asked him not to. What should I do?"
28,"I (25F) am happy when I’m away from my husband (40M) and adopted kids (10F, 9M, his bio kids)


We homeschool and work from home, so my life is being at the house 24-7 along with my infant. We work outside and in, and I find any excuse to leave with our baby and go grocery shopping, running errands, etc. Being at the house is a drain. The kids grew up here, my husband is renovating it to sell within the next five years, and everyone is in love with it. Except for me. There’s no welcoming smells (my husband is sensitive to every scent known to man), there’s no decorative decor, no photos, and nothing cushioned or comfortable or even clean (we want to save money and the house is too big to clean all the time. Plus we have a dog who owns the other couch and shoves bones and dirt into it and it’s ripped). It’s just horrible. I mean, not inhumane, it’s just a standard house that has zero meaning to me. In fact, it has a negative meaning. So many arguments and fights and disputes that I resent have happened here. When I grew up, everything was warm, welcoming, always spotless. Yeah, there were fights with my mom, but I never felt the residual resentment every day for being there. 

Whenever we go on vacation, things change. I feel better around my family and feel more love and less pressure. But still feel off. Then, I went off on my own to my grandma’s house for a little birthday party in the middle of nowhere, and I’ve never been happier. It was my baby and I, my mom, grandma, and other close family members. I FaceTimed my husband and adopted kids and was so happy. I was silly and fun and loving. Now that I came back, I feel sick and back into the never ending depressive state. Even in the first moment of seeing them. 

I feel lost.

&amp;#x200B;

For a bit of backstory, “Andrew” and I met in college and instantly hit it off. We dated for a good chunk of years before he popped the question this past Christmas. Obviously, I said yes! During our dating period, I met his father and younger sister. They’re not twins, but “Sara” always said she felt like they were because they grew up really close due to being 2 years apart. They roomed together in college &amp; probably would have stayed that way if not for meeting and soon after moving in with me. Sara wasn’t too fond of me at the start, but we’ve hit a point where we’re more friendly with one another. I wouldn’t consider her a friend, but I didn’t hate her either. So when she called Andrew one night saying how their father was kicking her out, I did admittedly feel bad for her. She’s 27 but has gone without working no more than two weeks at a single job before saying it was too much for her anxiety before quitting. Andrew and his father don’t get along, so I didn’t pry too much about it, family as a whole is a sensitive topic with him. What he did tell me and what I gathered though, is that he (their dad) was sick of babying Sara and was pushing her out of the nest, so to speak. He was firm on his decision, so we extended an invitation for Sara to move in with us while she got off her feet. BAD IDEA.   


Prior to her moving in with us and back when she was still living with their father, things would go missing, sometimes of value, other times not. It was a constant issue and really came to head when my engagement ring vanished one evening. No one really knew who to blame because it happened at a family gathering, friends and family showed up so it honestly could have been anyone. Andrew and I talked to as many people as we could about it, citing that we wouldn't go to the police if it was returned. Low and behold, Sara magically found it “in the washer” and not on the kitchen sink where I had left it when I was doing the dishes. I spoke to Andrew about it and he swore up and down his sister would never do that, I believed him. Prior to that, it was believed one of Sara’s many sketchy friends was stealing from them. After she moved in with us, I started noticing things go missing, be moved or used. I’d ask Sara and Andrew because we’re the only three living in the house, but both denied it. Okay, well, whatever. Maybe I’m just over thinking it, right? Wrong. Shit really hit the fan one morning when my 3 year old son’s piggy bank went MISSING. Andrew would never steal from his son, so it had to be Sara. I texted her telling her I wanted to talk to her while she was out. She didn’t come home that night. The next morning, Andrew comes to wake me up to tell me we need to talk. He leads me to the livingroom where Sara is sitting, looking down and very obviously flushed. Before I could even get a word in, she mutters “I didn’t steal (son’s name)’s fucking piggybank.” Uh..I never said you did? All I said in that text was I wanted to talk to you…. 

Reddit, I’ll be honest. I’m over it. I’m over sharing my house with someone I don’t trust around my stuff, let alone my kid. I regret ever offering her to stay here. It’s been 3 months with no progress. She hasn’t even started looking into jobs, she sits at home all day watching OUR Netflix, on OUR couch, eating OUR food. I’m just so fucking over it. Andrew doesn’t see it this way, he says her anxiety is really bad, that these things take time. Anxiety? You mean the anxiety that only flairs up when work is mentioned, not when she’s going out every other night to party with randoms that were met off Tinder all while acting like you’re 21 and not 30 in less than 3 years? I try telling him that these things aren’t issolated, that his expensive watch his late mother gave him somehow vanished not long after she moved in is suspicious, how my personal makeup is being used isn’t by him unless he needs to tell me something and most importantly the fact that someone actually stole less than $50 in change from a child! I’m at a loss as to what to do anymore. Help me talk some sense into him before I completely go off the rails &amp; boot the woman out the damn door. 

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR My fiance's sister has a questionable history of stealing. She's been babied her whole life with everyone thinking she can do no wrong. I mistakenly let her into our home only for her to steal from me, my soon to be husband and now my 3 year old. Fiance says it couldn't have been her, I call bullshit."
30,"How do I (MtF) tell a guy (30 M) that I've briefly been dating that I'm trans?


Okay, so before everybody thinks I'm some sort of boogeyman that leads some poor bloke on it truly wasn't my intention. To be fair I didn't even know he was interested in me until our last outing.

He's a super sweet guy and I'm definitely smitten, but I'll be honest when I say I thought he was miles out of my league in the sense that he seems relatively normal, has a good job, and is decent looking.

I personally have next to no dating experience. I'm a virgin, which is a whole other topic of conversation. So yeah, I think I just missed all the signals?

We've been hanging out and texting a bunch but it's mostly surrounded a mutual hobby. We've done lunch a few times. Last night we did dinner and a movie, which ya, theoretically would be prime date material. I thought it was just as buds. 

Nevertheless, he got all weird after the movie on the drive back to my place (which I now chalk up to nerves). He walked me to my door which is highly unusual. He kissed me. It was unbelievably and intensely awkward but not altogether unwanted. It was legit my first kiss if you don't count truth or dare ones in elementary school.

Afterwards he hugged me goodbye and he's been texting a lot ever since, more than normal, and asking for another date. I totally want to pursue this! However, I'm not entirely sure if he's aware I'm trans. I'm relatively passing. I don't get called out on it in my day to day life but I feel like if you really looked and got to know me it might be obvious. I've had some friends ask. I don't mind people asking if they're kind about it. I just don't bring it up myself since I don't think it's relative to my current relationships.

Obviously, when it comes to dating I know it's important and must be talked about. I'm just dreading the thought. I've always been rejected (mostly online) because I'm transgender which I hold no grudges over. I'm never going to be every guys cup of tea. I am hoping (perhaps a little naively) that I am this man's particular flavour.

Anyways, I guess my question is how should one break this sort of news? I've never had to do this! I'm nervous, yet strangely hopeful!

I suppose this question is more geared towards cis men. How would you want a trans female to tell you this sort of news? What would make you most comfortable especially if you are not interested in dating a trans person and would be thrown off by a potential girlfriend telling you this? I just want to cover all bases. 

Thank you!

TL;DR: I'm trans and I'm not sure if the guy I'm seeing knows that. How do I tell him in the most comfortable way possible?"
31,"How do I[26F] get over the fear of abandonment and let my wonderful boyfriend[25M] go?


Hello reddit. 

&amp;#x200B;

My boyfriend and I have been together for about an year. We have had a beautiful relationship and have created some of the precious memories. I love him with all my heart and I would do everything I can to make him happy. I always thought he was the one, the moment I met him. He has made me the happiest person in the world and everything about him is great. 

&amp;#x200B;

But. He does not like me the way I like him. He never has. He has even assured that it might never happen. In the whole year, he has only said - ""I like you"" about twice and that is all the words of endearment I have heard. While he says it is because he feels relationships are pointless, he has issues opening himself up to people, especially in relationships. Even in the past, he has had failed relationships because he was scared of feeling close to someone. It might sound rubbish but I have been experiencing it. When we are together, he is very loving and doting but he does not get a feeling of love and longing. Lately we have been having problems while having sex where he loses erection in the middle because suddenly the feeling drops. 

&amp;#x200B;

He mentioned he has not been fair to me and he will be misleading me if we continue to be together. He asked me to give him a week to sort out his feelings and clear his head. He thought that it is possible he could be overthinking. But you always know when it is over, and I, for a fact, know that it is over. It is only a matter of putting it out there and ripping the bandage off. 

&amp;#x200B;

We have been so good together. Never yelled at each other, respected each other, have shared interests, we joke a lot, we fool around so much, we experimented in bedroom. But it is all over. Sometimes you cannot make someone love you back, no matter how hard you try. Sometimes it is not your fault. I was ready to put up with zero-efforts made from his side, I told he need not do anything

&amp;#x200B;

I fear so much loss. I just cannot let go. I am terribly scared of having this conversation but I know I will be putting him through a lifetime of compromise if we stay together any longer. He might never break up, he might even be with me as long as I want, he promised he will always be there for me whenever I need anything. But I want more than that. I want him to be with me because he wants to. 

&amp;#x200B;

I do not know how to pull myself together and do this. He is the best person I know but this is not good for either of us. I fear I will never meet someone like him, and he might be the one that got away.. and I dont know how to deal with that at all. 

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR - My boyfriend is a wonder person, but we might not be the best partners and this could be a relationship based on compromises. I fear letting him go because he is so good. I need some pointers on how to pull myself together and get through it."
32,"I [35 F] have a grudge against my bf [38 M] for Walking out on me during the birth of our daughter


Hey reddit
I need some Input here. Also : no native Speaker, so please be gentle.
TL;DR: MY bf left a few minutes after our Baby was Born, didn't come back for 2 days and does not understand I feel betrayed by this. 


usually we (F35/M38, together for 3 years) get along fine and are a great Team. However every few months we get in a big fight over the birth of our daughter. 


The birth of my first one was a Nightmare, lost a lot of blood, had a lot of pain, needed extra medical procedures afterwards. 
So when I got pregnant a second time, I was first happy but increasingly scared. I made my BF promise me every day during the pregnancy to be there for me and not skip out on us. I told him he Needs to stay with us through the first day or two after birth.  


My daughter however decided she'd rather be born in the middle of june, so her birth actually fell on the very date mutual Friends had planned on visiting us. It was not planned they be there on the date of the birth, it was a coincidence. I also had an emergency C-section and felt like shit. So Baby is Born for abouth 30 minutes and bf asks me: can I go to work and the feed the stock (he is a farmer).
Me - thinking he will hurry and I know the stock has to be fed nomatterwhat - replies : yes.
Him: Can Friends still stay overnight? 
Me : yes 


So he went and fed the stock and made additional cleaning in the house and bought groceries and spent some time with Friends. In the evening they all came and along and looked at the Baby for 10 minutes than left all together. No Chance talking to him in private, also I was still in pain. So my bf told me: I have to go but just say the word and I will come back (we live 5min away from the Hospital). Late at night it got worse , so I wrote a message: ""please come I feel horrible and Need you."" 
He was already asleep and did not hear it. 
I waited an hour or so and then I called. He was asleep. 
A Little later the Hospital called. He was still asleep. The next morning he read my message, saw that I had called, saw the Hospital had called and decided it was not an emergency because than they would have called again - and went to work. He did not call or message me. afterwards he had a nice brunch with Friends. He arrived when all was well again and after the guests had left. 


Every 2 Months this whole Thing comes up. I feel betrayed. He usually brushes it off that he cannot change the past or it is my fault, as i should have called more often and used differend wording in my message. He acknowledged it would have been better, if he had been there when things were critical. 
I told him that I Need him to understand that I feel betrayed and that he is sorry About how it all went down. So he gave me ""BUT"" - excuses. ""I am a man of my word and I would have been there for you BUT you could have called one more time/ wrote yet another message / shouldn't have allowed Friends to stay / etc"". 

So I have a grudge for all of this and I cannot get over it. I explained several times that I Need an honest apology. The ""But""- explanations don't seem / feel right. 


So, how do we get over this? Am i really unfair to him?"
33,"I[24F] blocked my grandma on Twitter because I was tired of censoring myself. She is incredibly upset over it.


&amp;#x200B;

I know, I know, it sounds dumb but my grandma is a huge part of my life. My grandma found out about Twitter about a year ago, she followed me and my sisters and turned on notifications so she sees every time we tweet. Ever since this, I was making sure my tweets were “grandma appropriate”. A few days ago I thought of something funny to say about weed but I know my grandma doesn’t know I smoke, so I ended up blocking her because I was tired of censoring myself. She follows me on both Facebook and instagram, so it’s not like she can’t keep up with me.

This morning, she found out by going to my profile and seeing she was blocked. She was very upset. She sent me a text saying it really hurt her feelings and it was a slap in the face. I love my grandma and we have an awesome relationship, but I just wanted one form of social media where my family can’t judge me. I feel really bad because I hurt her feelings and I don’t know exactly how to respond to the text to convey that I love her and didn’t want it to hurt her feelings but there are things I want to keep private(?) without sounding like I’m hiding things. Any advice here?

&amp;#x200B;

tldr; my grandma is very sad that I blocked her on Twitter"
34,"I (21F) make my partner (21M) of two years cum every other day, if not more, and I haven’t cum in 2 months, and I asked him if he could please try and he screamed at me to use my vibrator instead.


My bf and I used to fuck 2 or 3 times a day for a year and a half straight, and every single time he’d make me cum afterwards since I can’t usually cum from sex. However, he has only tried ONCE this entire semester to make me cum after sex, bc he is just “too exhausted,” and he does “all the work” during sex. I give him blowjobs every other day, and usually suck him off for a while to get him hard before sex, but I guess none of that counts as “helping do the work”. Lately, I’ve just been extremely sexually frustrated, and I’ve been trying to use my vibrator, but it really isn’t the same as having a partner who loves you WANT to make you cum bc they WANT to give you pleasure. I tried expressing this to him, that it’s not even about the orgasm, it’s about feeling connected to him, and him wanting to make me feel sexy and wanting to make me cum. I want to make him feel sexy, and make him cum all the time, but it isn’t reciprocal at all. Lately I’ve been having a lot of self esteem issues bc I put on ten pounds and now this is just making me feel worse. I’ve voiced all of this to him, and today we had sex for the first time all week, and I was so excited thinking that he would help me cum afterwards since I’ve voiced everything. I made sure to do ALL the work during sex so he wouldn’t be “too tired,” but he came and then said he had to go run errands immediately after. I was visibly upset and he yelled at me about being angry all the time, and to just use my vibrator if it’s SO important that I cum. I told him I just needed some sexual attention and he said that he gives me attention all the time. I said yes I appreciate that, but I need you to make me feel sexy and wanted sometimes too. I tried to hug him and tell him I loved him before he left, but he just rejected me and left. 

I guess I just want some advice about what to do. I’m really frustrated, and I love him, but this doesn’t seem fair at all. 

TL;DR! I make my boyfriend cum all the time, and he yelled at me for asking him to help me cum after a 2 MONTH wait."
35,"My boyfriend refuses to help me clean.


I (24) and my boyfriend (24) have been together for two years and have lived together for a year and a half. We both work full time jobs yet I feel like I am the only one who is taking care of our house. He says all the time when we have a day off together “let’s clean the house” and then when I actually start and ask him to help he throws a fit. He says that all he wants to do on his day off is relax. I have no issue with that but when he gets off work at the end of the day all he wants to do is relax. I’ve been waiting on some new furniture to arrive and have been putting off rearranging our current furniture to accommodate for it because I know he would just throw a fit. Today, I get a message that it is ready to be delivered and I get excited as I’ve been looking forward to it and ask him to help me clean a bit and move things around to prepare for the movers to get there. He rolls his eyes at me but hastily breaks away from his video game long enough to clean off the nightstand and then gets upset and says he is going for a drive and to text him when the movers leave. So when he left I had to move our mattress and box spring to accommodate our new bed. Move our storage cabinet into the living room. Move our shelves and record player/records into the bedroom to accommodate our new tv and tv stand. I had to do all of this by myself. I’m just so disheartened by the whole thing. I put it off because I wanted help and low and behold I didn’t get it in the end. We split the bills 50/50. We both work 40 hours a week. However when we get home or have a day off, he thinks that all he should have to do is lay around in bed watching tv or play video games. Yet I’m expected to spend my free time cleaning up after him. Not too long ago, I thought maybe I would test it and see if I just stopped cleaning up after him, if he would. Nope. That wasn’t the case. A week passed and there were dirty dishes stacked up in the sink. Snack wrappers and empty beer bottles scattered around his side of the bed and around his gaming desk. I’m not exactly the cleanest person in the world by any means but I have no idea how someone could be completely content sleeping in a bed that is covered in crumbs and trash. How do I handle this? Outside of this issue we haven’t had any problems in our relationship. It’s just driving me insane. How do I talk to him about it?

TLDR: My boyfriend of 2 years absolutely refuses to help me clean and throws a temper tantrum when I ask him to."
36,"My [22F] sister [14F] is heart broken after our decades-long family turtle was given to a reserve. How can I help her?


It's a big turtle (or tortoise, whatever), over 1.50 meters long and about 70+ cm tall. He has been getting kind of ill and we talked to some people who hooked us up with other people and now they are taking him to a place where he will be taken care of and possibly have the chance to reproduce.

My sister and little cousins loved playing with him and there are countless pictures going back decades to our grandparents. She always protested form the beginning, but we told her it was the best for him, we don't have the knowledge to give him the best life and he would be in a place that is closer to his natural habitat.

So today they took him and she cried when they left, and it is now in her room quite literally crying and eating ice cream. I tried talking to her and it didn't go all that well. She was all ""how do you think I'm feeling?!"" and eye rolls and ""whatever"". I finally told her this was the best for him even if it hurts us and she basically did the ""tHIs Is ThE BEst FoR hiM evEn iF it HUrts Us"" mocking voice, so I was like, this is not gonna work.

What can I do to make her feel better, after she overcomes the initial snarky teenager phase? I mean I don't want to seem inconsiderate. It's easier for me to let go of him because I'm older and realize it's the best for him, and I didn't have *that* strong an attachment for him as my sister did.

Is there anything I can do for her? To make her feel better?

**tl;dr:** Our family's turtle was given to a reserve where he can live better and my sister is devastated. What can I do help her?"
37,"My inlaws are bullying my children


My (38) soon-to-be ex-husband (36) has been living with his (very conservative, religious) parents (60s) since he moved out last year. His younger brother (29) has always lived with them as he has trouble holding down a job. Our children (13M) (12M)(9F)(7M) spend every other weekend and two weeknights a week at their house. 
The last time my kids came home from spending time with them my 12yo was visibly upset, and asked to talk to me privately. He was sobbing and told me he overheard his uncle talking about how fat he is. Things like ""kid dies, they won't find a body bag big enough to fit around him"" and more, as well as stuff about him being slow, and being too sensitive. After talking privately to each of my children about how their weekend was, my 13yo told me the same story - though he confessed he was (uncomfortably) the person the uncle was talking to, and told me the grandmother was also in the room. They all also made other more passive gestures and comments shaming my 12yo's weight, adhd, asthma, and sensitive personality. They all have a history of doing so. 

Additionally, the uncle and grandfather are homophobes. My 13yo is not straight, though none of the adults in that house - including my ex - know that, as he (rightfully) doesn't feel safe coming out to them. They constantly make derogatory comments about ""queers"", ""faggots"" etc. Recently the grandfather commented on some acne near my 13yos mouth. ""what's that thing in your face? You been kissing boys?"" My son, uncomfortable, informed him it was a zit. The grandfather replied ""good"". My son was so uncomfortable he went and put a bandaid on his lip and hid in the bathroom for a while. 

Often the homophobia comes out while they're trying to steer my 7yo to a more traditionally masculine stereotype. He's happier wearing leggings (they're more comfortable), is trying to grow his hair out (he wants a ""man-bun""), and often let's his sister paint his nails. They have coerced him to get his hair cut multiple times, (""long hair is for girls"") even though he always bursts into tears about it when he gets home. They also unpolished his nails (""boys don't paint their nails"") and mysteriously never have the clothes he prefers available to him. 
My 13yo is struggling because they treat him like he's one of them, they think he has similar views, and they try to engage him in joining the bullying. He feels scared to stand up for himself and his brothers, but guilty for not doing so. 

Through all of this my daughter (9) is doted on, and praised for how pretty and how small she is. She's an amazing little girl, and often stands up to her uncle and grandparents (""there's no such thing as girl things and boy things,"" etc) and I've been told by my 13yo that their grandfather refers to her as being ""brainwashed by liberals"". 

My ex is aware that these things happen, though its less intense when he's around. He's unaware that our oldest son is attracted to boys. Since he grew up in that household he struggles to hear the homophobia, is pretty entrenched in gender stereotypes, and doesn't understand the particular weight these issues have on our sons. He also doesn't know how to handle his family in a way that doesn't make the bullying worse. 

What can I do? My ex will be living with his family for the foreseeable future, and I can't (and won't) restrict our children from spending time with their father.  But my sons are struggling, and I'm not there to defend them anymore. 


Tldr: my ex-husband lives with his toxic family, and they bully my children."
38,"My (34) wife (35)'s male ""best friend"" (39) is intruding into my little family


My wife has had a male ""best friend"" for years now - let's call him Carl.

He used to be in a long-term relationship with someone, but after that person left him a few years ago, he kind of clung to my wife - in a platonic way. Both my wife and he don't have many other friends nearby, so they spend a lot of time together.

Our daughter is 1 year old now, and it is very taxing for both me and my wife to look after her. I work all day, so my wife has to manage the brunt of caring for our kid. Naturally, when Carl offers to come over and look after our kid for a couple hours, she always wants to say yes.

Most of the time when I come home, I find Carl playing with my daughter.  
Every Thursday and Saturday night, Carl spends the evening drinking with my wife and watching TV - in addition to his random visits throughout the week.  
Carl's job is less taxing and he has a lot of free days, so he is free to visit often - sometimes he even comes by our house during his lunch break.  
He is good with tools, so when something around the house needs fixing, oftentimes I hear how Carl fixed it while I was at work. Needless to say, I am not happy about this help and prefer to handle things myself. When Carl comes over, he usually enjoys free delivery food, because, according to my wife ""it's in exchange for everything he does for us!"" - like buying toys and clothes for our daughter.  
When he showed up to my wife's family's Easter celebration, I felt like he crossed another line.

Despite my wife saying that she is in no way attracted to Carl, you can probably see why this situation bothers me greatly. She says that she really needs the extra help with the kid - and I can see how much of a relief it is for her. Carl himself has given up on dating, so the chance of him hooking up with someone else and creating a family for himself in the future is 0.   


When I tell my wife that I want Carl to visit us less frequently, she responds with one of these: 

* *""But he loves (daughter's name) so much - He says he misses her terribly!""*
* *""I only need his help now while she is little - let him help us!""* (though she does concede that he probably won't back off on his own anytime in the future either)
* ""It's great for her to have ""uncle"" Carl - He can teach her about technical things and maybe help with her career!""   


I feel like my place within the family is under assault and this tension is complicating the relationship with my wife - which used to be perfect, but is currently already strained by becoming parents recently and having very little sleep and free time.

How do you guys feel about my situation and what would you do if you were in my spot?  


TL;DR : My wife's ""best friend"" is intruding into my little family. What to do?"
39,"My SO (27M) wants to go on a 2 week vacation with his friends, while I (26F) stay at home with our child (2.5F). He doesn't see why I'm upset.


We have been together for 6 and a half years. 

A few nights ago my SO, Paul, was hanging out in the living room with his friend. His friend started talking about the vacation he and a few other friends are taking next month. It obviously wasn't the first time they talked about it. Paul looked at me and said ""oh yeah, i might go away for a couple weeks next month."" I thought he was joking because that doesn't seem like a serious way to phrase telling your girlfriend and mother of your child that you're going to spend 2 weeks away. 

I forgot about it last night until he said some friends were stopping by later and brought it up. He said he wasnt sure if he was going yet but he wanted to. He said he would cost him next to nothing cause its just a road trip to free places and parks to hike at. I said that it would make me upset if he went and he said that we can discuss it when he makes a decision. He said there was no sense in getting emotional over something that might not even happen. I said that I can't stop him, but he should know that if he decides to go it will hurt me and our relationship and tried to explain why.


It wouldnt cost next to nothing. Thats 2 weeks off of work, gas money, food, new hiking clothes, boots and supplies etc. The main stop is a trail that I've always wanted to hike at so it hurts to think of him doing something like that without me, knowing that I'll probably never have the chance, at least not until our child is grown up (assuming that my then my now mild joint issues don't get worse). He has stayed home with our daughter so i could go out once, for two hours. We have never had a big vacation just the two of us. We go 2 hours away from home for 3 days once a year. And with our child being so young, it's not much of a vacation for me anymore. We havent even had a real date in a year. My birthday is in a week and we aren't even doing anything for that. I love hiking and have been trying to get him to go on hikes with me for years and he has never gone with me.

Anyways, Paul just seemed angry and said that if it's apparently something I'd love to do myself(phrased as if I have never mentioned it before), it would be cruel to take it away from him because I'm jealous. He says since he is the one who carries our family by working he deserves this. His friends showed up early so we haven't talked about it since. Its not that i don't want him to have fun and he does deserve this. I'm just hurt that he didnt consider me. They've been talking about this for a month. I feel like an afterthought. 


Should I just get over this? Should I be happy for him?

Tldr; SO wants to go away for two weeks to a place I've dreamed of without me and im really upset"
40,"My (32F) husband (32M) has been texting his friend’s fiancé


So, my husband is in his friend’s wedding party and the friend (we’ll call him Andrew) has been going through a lot of drama with another family member (we’ll call Christina) who was recently kicked out of the wedding party by his fiancé (we’ll call melissa). Melissa was threatening Andrew saying she’d call off the wedding because of the drama, Andrew was beside himself, and apparently my husband decided to intervene as a mediator between the two of them. Now Melissa is constantly texting my husband venting her frustrations, and over the weekend I happened to see over his shoulder a text from her that said something along the lines of “I’m so thankful that Andrew has a friend that I can be a total psycho in front of ♥️ ,” and that stupid little heart kind of pushed me over the edge. I’ve been mad about it, but I also know that I can eat unreasonably jealous and my hormones are crazy right now because I had a miscarriage and a D&amp;C about 3 weeks ago- so I’ve just been kind of distant with him, trying to process things before making a big deal about anything. Yesterday he was texting me while I was at work and he asked me if something was wrong, so I let loose and told him that I was upset he’s getting into what seems like such an intimate emotional relationship with this other girl. He basically acted completely shocked and said that he was only trying to help and never saw it that way. I asked how he’d feel if he and I were fighting and I was crying to his Andrew about it, sending him heart emojis while telling him how grateful I am to have him (Andrew) in my life, and he just reiterated that he never thought of it that way, but didn’t say if he’d be upset about it. So now he’s saying, “alright, I’ll stop talking to her because it makes you mad.” I want him to understand how I feel, though. I feel like I’m being ridiculous and jealous, and I don’t want to be that way. Part of the problem is that Melissa has made it pretty clear to me that she doesn’t like me, she’d prefer to hang out with my husband and her fiancé without me. I feel like in her mind, she thinks that by marrying Andrew she gets this package deal where she can have my husband on the side for all of her emotional needs that Andrew is apparently incapable of fulfilling.

TL;DNR: I’m upset that my husband had been providing round the clock emotional support to his friend’s fiancé and she is sending him messages with heart emojis thanking him for being there for her."
41,"My (21) gf (20) hit me. Am I overreacting.


We didn’t even get in an argument. She just got mad because I touched her with a dirty hand, and I forgot, and she slapped the side of my face, pretty hard. I was angry, because it felt spiteful, and she said she was angry she did it so hard, but not that she hit me. 

We roughhouse all the time. If I hurt her on accident, I apologize profusely. She’s hit me like this multiple times, and every time she doesn’t say sorry, says it was a joke, so I let it go. This time,  it felt purposeful and vengeful and She won’t even say sorry. She refuses to see my side. I just dropped her home after this happened, no words exchanged because I was fucking mad. And we had a great day together too. 

She texted me saying I’m overreacting, and to contact the cops if I felt she was really abusing me. And no, I don’t think she is. I just find that fucking absolutely unacceptable. I’ve never hit her out of spite or anger, I’ve had that done to me by family, and people that I thought cared about me, and I won’t react physically with anger. Or verbally. I’ll just be quiet.  Again, she says she said she’s sorry for how hard it was, but not that she hit me. And again I’m overreacting. And that I’m showing my true colors. And I think this is ridiculous. I said I won’t talk to her until she fully apologizes, and I’ve gone back on my word before but I won’t this time. She says don’t wait for an apology and to just lose her number. 

This just took me back mentally to a place I don’t want to be, now after a lot of mental work I put in, I’m finding myself thinking about things I would rather not. I’m really fucking hurt right now, deeply, and I truly think I’m misguided enough to think I’m overreacting. I know I’m not. But I would like opinion/advice anyway. Thank you. 

TLDR; gf slapped me, won’t say sorry, and that I’m overreacting. I don’t think I am."
42,"My bridesmaid did not show up to my wedding now is angry at me for blocking her


My bridesmaid was expecting a baby when she agreed to be my bridesmaid.  During the time of my wedding the baby would have been 3 months or so. 

Anyway, a week before my wedding after I got her outfits for the ceremony she told me she can't walk down the aisle cause she would have to feed her baby. I asked her if she could leave the baby with her parents who she lives with but she said no.

I said that is fine. She said she would come to the reception without her baby. The wedding day came and she never showed up. She didn't message me for two days and to why. I even saw her liking Instagram pictures and stories which she posted on my wedding day. Yet she somehow couldn't make it.

At this point I was beyond pissed so I blocked her. I spent probably around $240 for her and her husband's plates. Money aside I was hurt by the fact she did not even bother to notify me about the situation as to why she was coming. I understand if someone is sick but she did not let me know at all.

Anyway since she realized I blocked her she sent me an angry message calling me cheap and a bad person for ending our 5 year relationship. She also said my marriage wont last cause I act this way and  that I have no true friends. 

Anyway, I find the whole situation of her not showing up really distasteful. She also lived 10 mins drive from the wedding venue! I haven't even responded to her message. I don't want to mend bridges at all.

TL;DR BM did not show up to the wedding."
43,"My boyfriend failed another class


My boyfriend (21M) of two years and I (22F) are both in college. Well kind of. I graduate next week. Anyway, I’m currently attempting to move on to a masters program so I can eventually have a sick job and make bank. My boyfriend is so far away from graduation it’s scary. 

In the semester we first started dating he failed I believe three classes. I assumed it was because our relationship was new and exciting and we had distracted each other. My grades had slipped too after all. The following semester he failed another class and was put on first level academic probation. His GPA at this point was probably about a 1.5. 

The following semester he didn’t technically fail anything, but the majority of his classes were physical education and anything that wasn’t was a class that he’d already taken and failed, but got a C in this time around. 

His past two semester including this one he has failed at least one class. His major is business, and he has failed intro to business twice now. It’s not as if he has a difficult time learning the subjects either. He’s just simply not doing the assignments. Every time he fails a class he tells me he didn’t do the assignments, tells me an excuse why he didn’t, and blames the professor for his grade. 

I should also mention that this education is 100% free. His parents are paying his tuition, rent, groceries, car, etc. He even gets spending money. He doesn’t have to work at all but he’s still struggling. I know for a fact he has ADHD and depression and for a while he was being treated for both and he seemed like he was doing better. But now he won’t take the medication and refuses to hear anyone out about it. 

I don’t know what to do. I have a full time job and am ready to rent a small house and possibly get engaged. I can easily see myself doing these things with him. He is the love of my life. An absolutely wonderful man. But I can’t trust him with any form of money at all. 

Last week I gave him my card to pick up some tampons before work. He told me he was going to put gas in my car because I’m very low. I told him to wait until the next day when I got paid. He did it anyway. It was only five dollars, but I only had $40 in my account, and I specifically told him not to. We had a fight, he apologized. The next day I got paid and he still had my card as I hadn’t asked for it back yet. He told me he was going to put gas in, I said please only do $20 worth, as I hadn’t transferred my paycheck yet. He put $27 and overdrafted my account. Another apology. Both felt very “I’m only saying sorry to shut her up.”

I literally cannot trust him with my card. I feel like he has no respect for me or my hard earned money. I think he feels like just because I can ask my parents for money and they’ll give it to me, I should be more willing to spend my money. I *hate* asking my parents for money. Absolutely despise it. I would much rather be independent. I spent $200 on him on his birthday with my own money. He has yet to get me a present, though he continues to say he’s going to do it. My birthday was in December. His was the beginning of April. I constantly feel disrespected and as though I am mothering him. 

Obviously I’ve only written about our issues here, but I can assure you his good outweighs the bad. I just don’t know how to deal with waiting for him to grow up. I’m extremely frustrated. I feel like he’s never gonna graduate, never gonna get a job, and just end up living off his inheritance. I’m at a loss for how to deal with this. How can I help him grow and learn? I want him to start getting medication for his depression, he already sees a therapist. How can I support him without condoning his irresponsible behavior?

Tl;dr my boyfriend is irresponsible but I wanna marry him anyway send help"
44,"Is it unreasonable of me (24M) to be upset about boyfriend (29M) keeping his exes' nudes?


tl;dr: My boyfriend keeps private pictures and videos of the guys he used to sleep with, am I overreacting if this behavior bugs me?

I'm in a 5-month relationship with my current boyfriend. This is also my first relationship, so I'm not necessarily sure what's appropriate between couples. However, the thing that bothers me is that my boyfriend keeps a folder of sexual pictures and videos of his exes and former hookups. It's not that I'm realistically scared he'll go back to them, besides some of that material is rather old, but the habit seems kind of distasteful. He doesn't even see an issue with looking at or getting off to that stuff while I'm there. He equates it to porn, but I don't think that's the same thing. My boyfriend actually has history with these guys and he's getting off to the memory of them.

Am I being possessive or insecure if I ask my boyfriend to delete those pictures? Or at least not to look at them while we're spending time together."
45,"I (24F) think my BIL's wife (30F) may be mistreating her baby


TLDR - I think my SIL is mistreating my nephew, but don't know how to communicate with her about it without her becoming defensive and offended. 

&amp;#x200B;

My brother in law and his wife have a two year old son. I am extremely worried about him, and the way she treats him. She has a 12 year old daughter from previous relationship, and seems to think she knows everything about children and will not take any advice. Not that I know everything about children, but some things are giving me red flags. He is 24 months and still has not said a word, he doesn't use any hand expressions, he never initiates play. She does not speak or play with him, preferring to be on her phone instead. The only time she interacts with him is when she feeds him. She still feeds him the food a 6 month old baby would eat - two meals of baby food, and a yoghurt for desert. She never feeds him any fruit, veggies, or any solid or real food. He is very pale and seems underweight. She also seems to think that rather than trying to teach him words, watching Youtube videos will somehow teach him. She still spoon feeds him his food, he doesn't know how to do or say anything. I know he is only 2 but he seems to be behind emotionally and mentally. It makes me very upset, as my BIL works 9/5 and doesn't even see how she treats him. She never takes him to see any other children, they only leave the house to come and see my MIL and FIL once a fortnight. We have tried to talk to them both about this but she gets very defensive and offended, even though we just want the best for our nephew. Please help me with how I can communicate this to her or help my nephew without hurting her feelings."
46,"My husband (32m) keeps pushing me to join ""mommy groups"" and find friends who are into more family oriented activities... but I (26f) don't enjoy them


I have a pretty full social life already. I have a close set of girl friends from college, a couple good friends from the gym, and a couple close friends from work.

I honestly already find it hard to maintain all those friendships that are important to me, while also being a mom to my 3 year old son. But I make an effort, to keep in touch with my college friends even though they're scattered around the country. To keep going to the gym even though it's less often. And to make time to go to happy hour with my work friends occasionally.

All those people are very important to me, I really value the friendships I have right now, and I don't want to lose them or lose my identity now that I'm a parent. I've known some people who just vanished socially once they had kids and I never wanted to be like that. 

My husband has been kind of frustrated with my social circle though, he says that it would be way nicer if I could foster friendships with other parents of kids around our son's age. He'd have more kids to play with, I'd have a lot more knowledge about parenting that really comes with having a support network of other parents. (I admit we are flying blind here, he's our first kid so we're figuring it out as we go)

And also ""friend time"" and ""family time"" wouldn't have to be so separate for me, if I had other friends who had families.

That all made sense, but I really don't in how workable it would be. I've met other parents through the ""new parents"" class we took when I was pregnant, and through arranging playdates. And those kinds of activities aren't really conducive to forming the deep kinds of friendships that I value. You can't talk about anything and everything with the kids around. Unfortunately I've found a lot of new parents can be a little competitive and catty, so if I speak to someone honestly and without pretense, I've felt judged.

I'm sure there are other parents I could become great friends with, but it's hard, and I'm already having trouble balancing all the friendships I value right now.

I also feel like my husband is trying to get me to replace my current social circle to some degree, which is something that I would hate to do. I know it can be frustrating to have social activities that you can't really bring kids to, like happy hour, the gym, skype calls with friends across the country, but I enjoy the time just for myself.

My husband hasn't had as much trouble finding friends who fit a family lifestyle, one of his buddies from college has a 5 year old girl, and some of his work friends have young kids too. 

I just wish he'd understand what works for him doesn't necessarily work for me.

tl;dr My husband wants me to join mommy groups and also seems to dislike my current social circle. I wouldn't be happy like that."
47,"My [34M] spouse [30FtNB] came out as trans a year ago, two years into our marriage. This has been incredibly difficult for both of us. How do we survive it? Can we survive it?


As the title says, I found out a year ago that I'm not married to a woman. This wasn't a secret that was kept from me beforehand, but something that my partner discovered about themselves after many years. My initial reaction was to be as supportive as possible, letting them know that I still love them, I'm staying with them, and I'll help them through whatever they need. They identify as nonbinary now, and feel more comfortable letting their body hair grow out, binding their chest, and generally being pretty androgynous. It helps keep their dysphoria at bay, which can get pretty bad. They're also thinking about going on a small dose of testosterone.

Unfortunately, the things that helps my partner's dysphoria are things that I honestly find physically unattractive. It's starting to feel like I have more of a husband than a wife, and even if my partner doesn't call themselves a man, it's gotten to the point where I sorta feel like they are. At this point I'm expecting them to come out as a trans man any day. I'm not gay, and I've tried very hard to change how I view our marriage so that I still find my partner attractive, but it just doesn't come very naturally anymore.

This has been compounded by some less-than-responsible behavior on my partner's part. We're getting by okay with just my income, but my partner has a very difficult time sticking with any job. Jobs can get very stressful and overwhelming for them, and it takes a serious toll on their mental health. Getting misgendered, for example, triggers dysphoria that is hard to cope with/ They actually quit their last two jobs by ghosting their employers. And even though we're getting by, we could really use the extra money to pay off some debts, even if it's not a ton. But instead, for now, my partner is more content with staying at home all day because at least they aren't spiraling into a horrible depression due to dysphoria.

This is all to say: I still love my partner, but I've been feeling absolutely drained recently. I know marriages aren't supposed to be easy, but I don't think they're supposed to be \*this\* hard. I feel like I'm losing the person I married and they've been replaced with someone that I wouldn't have wanted to date if I were single. Are these difficulties something we can survive? Am I sacrificing too much of my own happiness for my partner's sake? How do I know if this is something that should be ended? I don't know if I'm at that point yet but the thought does occasionally enter my mind, and I feel horribly guilty about it. I just don't know if this is a rough patch or something I'm going to end up resenting my partner for.

TL;DR: wife came out as nonbinary, it's been very hard on us. Is our situation sustainable?"
48,"Ex-husband's (33m) girlfriend (24f) messaged me wanting to share Mother's Day with my (29f) child.


Tl;Dr: My ex-husband's girlfriend of two years messaged me about sharing future Mother's day with my child. Am I unreasonable to firmly say no?

My ex and I were together about 10 years and we have a 6 year old child together. Our custody agreement is 50/50. We broke up in 2017 and I was able to move out nearly a year ago. In our state, divorce cannot finalize until both parties are separated for 12 months. She moved in with him a year ago as I was moving out. 

For the most part, him and I are on the same page for all things relating to our child. We discussed holiday arrangements months prior and agreed at that he gets get for Father's day and I get her for mother's day (seems like a no brainier, right?).

This year mother's day falls on a weekend where he is scheduled to have her. I reached out asking if we can switch weekends. We switch weekends every couple months on both ends, there's never any drama and a lot of flexibility. He asked if it was ok if they can have her Saturday and drop her off Sunday morning, stating that his g/f wanted to spend time with her as well. I thought it was odd but I said that I preferred she be dropped off or I pick her up Saturday night because I wanted to do a mother's day breakfast. He agreed to my request.

Hours later I get a message from his g/f asking how I'd like to conduct future holiday plans. I told her that him and I already arranged holidays, it's documented, and if he wanted to discuss those arrangements he can reach out to me. By this point I was getting ticked off. 

The conversation gets worse. Of course she was really talking about mother's day. She says that she left everything behind to ""help you and him"" raise our daughter and she thinks of herself as a mom to my child. Mind you, neither of them reached out to me to discuss how I'd feel about her being referred to as ""mom"" prior. 

At first she wanted it to be where whomever had my child on the custody schedule would be the one to spend mother's day with them. I told her no.

Then she tried to request a few hours every year. I told her no.

Then she tried to negotiate and ask for a few hours every year. I told her no.

I was firm. I told her how important this holiday is for me. I only have my one child and I don't plan on having any more. I also explained that I would never allow a romantic partner of mine demand time from father's day away from my ex. 

The conversation ended with her dropping the subject and saying ""you can have her this year. But you should think about it"". 

Am I wrong for wanting this holiday for myself? She comes from a blended family so I am sure her perspective is different than mine. Would I be petty to specifically ask my divorce lawyer to make sure that mother's day specifically goes to me? 

I found it very disrespectful that she thinks she is entitled to time with my child on my special day because she decided to become a step parent. I even told her that I am ok with her celebrating their relationship on a different day."
49,"My boyfriend (29m) thinks I'm (21f) covering for his best friend's (30m) cheating girlfriend. (20f) But I wasn't. I just didn't recognize her face when I walked in on her and my roommate.




I am in a relationship with Nick and have been since freshman year of college. Nick's best friend is Alex, and Alex has a girlfriend named Lia. I've met Lia a couple of times, when the boys are hanging out and she and I come along

It's worth mentioning that I have a terrible memory for faces, if I see someone out of the context I usually see them, I don't recognize them. Unless they've got some distinctive mannerisms, or I hear them speak, or they're wearing something distinctive.

I live in student apartments with 15 other people. One of them is Bob. I'm not really close with him, were just in the same building.

One night last month, I walked into the laundry room and saw Bob screwing a girl on the dryer. I was just like ""ewww take that to your bedroom."" The girl was staring wide eyed at me, but I thought that was just her being shocked at getting caught. They both looked shitfaced drunk. Like the girl was really sloppy, hair all over her face, her dress was hitched up super awkward around her neck

A few weeks later, I walked into the house and saw Bob making out with the girl on the sofa of the common room. I snapped at him to take it upstairs, I didn't want to see that.

Just this week, I heard from Nick that Alex dumped Lia because she was cheating. I shrugged that off. Then Nick asked me if I'd actually seen it happen, because apparently when Lia got caught lying she told everyone that I'd known about it for a while and never said a thing. 

I said no. 

Nick said that he'd heard I'd walked in on her and Bob in my house. And then it clicked that Lia was the girl that Bob was screwing in the laundry room and making out with in the living room . I explained that yeah I did see it a few times but I didn't recognize her. And Nick just doesn't believe me, he thinks there's no way I saw a girl I knew in my house a couple times and didn't make the connection. He told me that it changed the way he saw me, that I'd ignore something so shitty instead of speaking up. And lie afterwards.

I honestly don't know how it didn't click for me. But it didn't. And it looks like I'm lying. How can I explain things to my boyfriend?

tldr - I saw the girlfriend of my boyfriend's best friend cheating, but I didn't recognize her. My boyfriend assumes I did recognize her and was covering it up"
50,"My (f35) husband (m39) won't change his last name.


My husband and I had numerous, hours-long discussions about our name situation before we got married. HOURS of conversations about it. Like, civil and intelligent conversation where he and I decided we would both change our last names to a direct translation of his current name that honors my heritage as well. 

We got married in September, and haven't done the name change stuff in the meantime but it was still the plan. I'm taking an international trip soon and need a new passport, so I decided to go to the courthouse and submit my name change before I get a new passport so that I don't have to do it twice. 

I come home and tell him, and ask when he plans to go do it since it was the plan. Now he is saying he won't do it because he's worried about what his parents will think. 

He's nearly 40 years old and his reason for backtracking is his parents. I feel betrayed, lied to, conned. I mean I've already submitted everything to change my name to this new name and now he says he doesn't want to. 
 

I don't know what to do. 

Tldr my husband and I agreed to both change our names and now he won't."
51,"How do I [15M] tell my brother [19M] that his best friend [19M] has been sexually abusing me?


He always comes over to our house for hours on end very often and sleeps over. The abuse been going on for months now and I just want it to stop. I've figured out ways to avoid being alone with him but now he is threatening to out me to my parents (they are violently homophobic) if I don't give into him and perform sexual acts. I know reporting is not a possibility because I have no evidence, I'd be outed to my parents and no one would look at me the same way ever again.. so I'm trying to find other methods to make him go away.


I told my brother that I don't like him and I find it uncomfortable and intrusive that he's always over, but I don't know what to tell him when he asks for me to elaborate and he's very dismissive. They've been friends for over 10 years, my bro might not even believe me. 


I just don't know how to tell him. I'm already out to him (that's how my abuser knew) and a few of my close friends. I don't know how to put it into words, I don't know what kind of reaction I get whether he'd be sad or angry at me, himself or my abuser.. This is the only way I know how to make it stop without my parents finding out. 


What do I say to him? When is a good time to tell him? 


Also, please don't tell me to report it to the police or anything, I am sure that my life would be made so so much worse if my parents found out.


TL;DR: I want to tell my brother that his best friend has been sexually abusing me so he can go away, but I don't know how."
52,"Me [Male, American, 29] visiting fiancée family [Female, Belgian, 28] in Europe. How can I tactfully get out of this awful visit?


My wife is from a small town in Belgium and I grew up in Alabama but we live in Texas. I met my future wife while she was visiting NYC and she later came and studied in the U.S. I work as in-house counsel for an organization and she's a nurse. We do okay for ourselves, nothing tremendous and we're by no means ""rich"" but we're happy. 

We elected to live in the US as it made the most sense for both of us. Her parents reside in England but her sisters, aunts, uncles, grandparents and extended relatives all live in a small town in Belgium. We had never visited there and finally made the trek. I honestly wish we hadn't. It's so far been 4 days of: ""you know why America sucks....?"" and ""it's better in Belgium because..."" and ""you need to speak more French!"" followed by ""you fucked that up, you *should* have said {x}, why are Americans so bad at languages?"" On top of that, I'm expected to pay for everyone's meals - I've paid for groceries (which are incredibly expensive here) for her relatives, paid for countless steaks and fries, rounds of beer and desserts and entrance to every place they want to go. This has been many times more expensive than anticipated and there seems to be no end in sight. 

My fiancée is so happy to see her sisters, brother and other relatives, but I find myself constantly on the verge of losing my temper. I had to shell-out for yet another dinner yesterday which cost me something like €380 for dinner for people who took pains to tell me why life in their little hamlet is far superior (intellectually) to the vacant parking lot that is Dallas, TX. 

If I try and speak French, I get a snicker and a comment. If I speak English, I get roasted. Mostly, I sit silently and they've taken to calling me Marcel Marceau. My fiancée is absolutely oblivious to all of this and thinks I'm embellishing this. I've been here 5 days and absolutely had enough. She's always holding on to her sister laughing about some dumb thing they did 20 years ago. She's so happy to see her family that she's forgotten that I'm even here, I think. 

I want to rebook a ticket and go home. They can talk shit about me without me needing to be here, so why not get a jump on my work? I'm so angry that I'm not thinking straight and really don't know how handle this situation. I need advice on what to say to my fiancée and if leaving really is the best recourse. 

tl;dr visiting my fiancée's ungracious, rude, relatives and I've had enough. I've spend thousands of Euros on them and I'm fed up of them mocking me endlessly for a week. I want to just leave and go home but not sure if it's the right course of action."
53,"My (28 F) husband (29 M) is obsessed with the idea that I am cheating while I’m pregnant with our second kid.


We have been married for almost 7 years and currently have a 3 year old. Recently found out I was pregnant, which was a surprise. Due to me being the only working one, I’ve been picking up extra shifts at work to save up money for the new kid and maternity leave since I still have a ton of student loans.

Recently my husband has been obsessed with accusing me of cheating. When I go to work or work meetings. We both agreed for me to pick up extra shifts!! He thinks that I’m lying about being at meetings despite the fact that I always offer to show him my time card. He says that lack of interest in sex is another sign of cheating. Sure, maybe. But I’m pregnant and have been super sick.

It’s to the point where I want to blow up at him each time he brings it up. I can’t stand it. I get called a lying whore, cheating slut, etc.

I’m fed up. 

TL;DR! Husband keeps accusing me of cheating while I’m pregnant with our second kid. He thinks that me working overtime, which we both agreed on, is a sign."
54,"[UPDATE] Me [24F] with my new fiance [24M] announced engagement after dating 3 years. Not sure how to deal with unexpected family reaction.


Hey everyone. I posted my (original issue)[https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/bgneae/me_24f_with_my_new_fiance_24m_announced/] a little while ago. Long story short, I got engaged and when I announced it to my mom and maternal relatives I got a really cold reception. I posted basically because I didn't really know how to process it. 

I'm still kind of in disbelief, but I actually had a chance to chat with one of my maternal aunts. I thought she called me and called her back; turns out it was a butt dial, but since I had her on the line I decided to ask her what her perspective was. 

I won't really hash out the details of the conversation, but essentially it seems to boil down to a few things.

First, because of the distance and language barrier, none of them really know Frank very well, so mostly they are going off what they're told about him. It seems that my mom has been talking about him in unflattering ways and just overall painting him as ""not good enough"". 

One weird thing that they seem to have fixated on is that he doesn't have a full driver's license. I don't either (I have a new driver license, he has a learner's). Neither of us have a car and public transit is decent enough in our city, so getting a full license hasn't really been a top priority. 

It seems, though, that between that and him not being in the workforce full-time yet (because, you know, still in school -- even though they've been told about his part-time job), my mom doesn't think very highly of his ability to provide and disapproves despite saying to my face that she will just ""love whoever [I] love"". They see only my mom's disapproval and nothing of how hard he works, how sweet he is, how creative, funny ... etc. So if I am to change their minds, I'm already starting on the back foot and running damage control. 

Second, they seem to think I'm still a baby. My aunt was saying how I'm still young and all. I pointed out I was turning 25 this year (on the young end for engagement, sure, but by no means a child) and she actually did a double take when she realised that. She also asked about a lot of things -- what we planned for the future, if we've talked about having kids, what sort of lifestyle we want: basic-ass shit that anyone with half a brain of foresight would talk about before an engagement. I obviously had answers for all the things she asked, and she almost seemed surprised that I never once had to say ""we've never talked about that"" or ""I don't know"".

She ended up saying that I'm a grown person who can make her own decisions, and that she just wishes me well. We also talked about my mum a bit. We kind of ended the conversation there. 

It's been a few days now and at the end of it all, I think ... I'm just angry and sad. I know neither Frank nor I are at our lifegoals yet and we still have plenty of growing to do. 

But I just feel super disrespected and underestimated. I'm pissed that my mom would claim to just want me to be happy and that she'd love whoever I love, and then turn around and talk shit about the man I love and who has been an incredible supportive partner to me. She keeps saying that she wants a better relationship with me, but honestly I'm starting to see that she doesn't. Not really. She wants a better relationship with who she wants me to be, not who I actually am.

And to be fair, I guess I feel the same way. I would love a better relationship with my mum -- if my mum were more genuinely supportive and less judgemental and didn't think her perspective is the objective truth quite so much.

Whatever. I'm still going to get married. And I'm super happy about that. My future husband is a swell guy who makes me really happy. If she or anyone else can't bring themselves to feel the same way, they can feel free to fuck right off.

TL;DR: Turns out, it was a combo of my mom talking shit about my fiancé and people forgetting I was a literal adult. I'm pissed at that but am still super excited to get married, and have resolved that if anyone can't be happy for us, then they are free to not let the door hit their ass on the way out."
55,"My (21F) lab partner (23M) removed me from a group document and completely changed my section.


This is a senior project that we have to do with a team. One of my teammates, K, has been very controlling throughout the entire process. Basically, K will independently make a decision and it's final. For this reason, literally everything in the final project was done by K because they refused to delegate roles. In fact, the work that I did got cut at the 11th hour because K decided they wanted to do it. 

&amp;#x200B;

Fast forward to the presentation: We had a shared Google Slides document. I had one slide in my section that K did not like the design of. As a note, we had clearly defined who was going to cover which topics. Basically, I created X,Y,Z and K wanted A,B,C. These two designs were virtually identical and K mostly wanted to nitpick my section. We reached a compromise of X,Y,C. I adjusted the slide accordingly but then K removed my editing privileges from the document and changed my slide to A,B,C. 

&amp;#x200B;

I honestly do not care that the slide is A,B,C. I am *livid* that I was locked out of my own presentation and had my own slides changed by someone else. I honestly don't know what to do. I'm scared to go to our project adviser because my work isn't in the final project. If I explain why this is the case, I don't have an answer for ""Why didn't you speak up sooner?"" Additionally, K has a job interview with the company that supported our project, and I don't want to make them look bad professionally. 

&amp;#x200B;

So what do I do? We have a mock presentation with our adviser in two days. One of my ideas was to just not present the slide and say ""I didn't make this,"" but I feel like that's counter productive. I absolutely do not want to lie down and take this because I believe K's actions are totally unacceptable. If I go to our adviser, it could hurt me more than K. If I bring the company representatives into this, it hurts K more than me. I'm not really seeing a way to fix the problem without one person suffering in some great way. 

&amp;#x200B;

tl;dr My incredibly controlling lab partner and I disagreed on the design of a slide. After we reached a compromise, my lab partner locked me out of the document and completely changed the slide. If I go to our adviser, it could hurt me more than them because nothing I worked on is in the final project."
56,"My (18m) parents (late50s) want me to sell my PC


Some context:
So, I'm 18 and I live with my parents. I work full time and I'm attending a college that's close to our home. I've sat down and talked to them about getting my own place, but they insist on me staying. They said it would be stupid to pay for a place to stay while they would let me stay for free, and I didn't argue. So I'm still living with them. (Just wanted to clear up that I'm not a 39y/o bum who lives in his parents basement). They're Christian, conservative and fairly strict, but not crazy.


Anyways, I purchased a gaming desktop PC. It was pretty expensive, and I saved up my extra money to buy it. Well, when I brought it home, my parents were ticked that I bought it without taking to them. They think video games are a waste and addictive (reinforced by the recent Fortnite kid's trends). They now want me to sell it. I refused. I had this thing custom built, and I saved for a long time to get it. So they're angry. I have the PC under my bed. I don't want to get rid of it, but I also don't want to make them mad. I love and respect my parents. I am also living in their house. I just don't know what to do. I've wanted this PC for so long, and now I can't even use it.

57,"My [25M] girlfriend [22F] of 4 months got mad at me when I took off her fingerprint from my iPhone. Am I too paranoid?


We’ve been dating for 4 months now and back when we first started dating, I was driving somewhere and she wanted to change the song which was playing of my phone. She asked for my pin since I was driving and changed the song but also went into my settings and added her own finger print to my phone so she could unlock it anytime. 

She never asked me and I didn’t know how to feel about it back then. I have absolutely nothing to hide but the fact that she has access to literally all my banks and work emails and communication made me paranoid. I felt uncomfortable but didn’t know how to bring up the subject without making it look like I was hiding something.

Although I have nothing to hide in terms of talking to other girls and stuff, i have embarrassing photos and group chats where we just joke around and share inside jokes and memes that I’m just not comfortable with her knowing about yet.  

It got to the point where I have to bring my phone literally everywhere with me when we are together. Washroom/shower/kitchen just so I can keep an eye on and make sure she isn’t going through it. 

So last week I decided that I’m not comfortable with that anymore and took her finger print off. I explained to her how I felt and that I have nothing to hide and she can go though my phone anytime she asks as long as I’m there with her. But she got mad and won’t talk to me. She left the house and basically gave me silent treatment. 

I feel like I did something wrong and came off as too paranoid (which I am). Just the thought that she can basically get me fired and take all my money if she wants makes me paranoid. Like what if we have a big fight one day and decide to screw me over?  Not that I don’t trust her, but it just too early to be sharing these things I feel. I also haven’t been in a real relationship for sometime now so maybe I’m not used to sharing that level of information and access to my life with anyone. 

I like her a lot and want this relationship to go somewhere. But I just feel like she should understand and respect my privacy. 

What do you think?

TL;DR - my girlfriend isn’t talking to me because I took off her fingerprint of my iPhone because I’m too paranoid that she has access to banks and work emails."

My fiance and I have been together for three years. we got engaged last october and are very much in love. she is my everything, my best friend, the most loving, kind, brilliant, etc etc person I have ever met. I could go on all day but this is not what this is about.

As we have been beginning planning our wedding over the last few months a major concern has been budget. We are not wealthy, and neither of our families has a lot of money to throw at us (not that we would ask anyhow) and regardless we mutually decided that a budget priority would be saving for a house, rather than an overly extravagant event. About in january we agreed that we would look for and take on some side jobs to get additional cash flow. I started helping out at a local bike garage, and she picked up some WfH jobs in online stuff, fixing up peoples' websites and online stores, which she is very good at.

Then, two days ago, she forgot her cell phone at home while I was on my day off, doing some regular housework. She gchatted me and told me if anyone called to just let it go to voicemail - no problem. But later in the afternoon, I was walking by and her screen lit up from an incoming notification, so I glanced at the phone and saw a couple text notifications from her sister, as well as a venmo of $500 or thereabouts. I presumed it was for one of the clients she had done web work for so I messaged her ""just saw you got paiiiid babe nice job"" with a money face emoji. she sent some hearts back and I went on with my day. However, when she got home, she seemed very quiet and distant, but I assumed she'd had a hard day at her regular job, and tried to take extra care of her, making dinner, a little extra hugs kisses, etc...and then out of the clear blue evening sky she just says ""I have a huge confession to make."" my heart jumped a little bit but I tried to keep calm and not over-think anything.

She was visibly shaking and just started spilling everything before I could really respond.  She apparently met up with an old high school friend a couple of months ago who is a sex worker, and who suggested trying her hand at Findom. If you're unfamiliar, it is basically making men give you money. Anyhow, she told and showed me how she set up a twitter, fetlife, instagram, and other online accounts, and started looking for subs, or ""pigs"" as she referred to them. She apparently is quite good at this and has been making somteimes over $1000 a week doing...very little, aside from posting risque photos on her profiles with captions about wanting boys to prove they were rich by sending her money.

I was floored...but also a little proud? She was sobbing and I tried to comfort her as much as I could, just my mind was spinning with everything she told me. She kept repeating that she never did anything explicitly sexual or met anyone in person and I believe her. We have slept separately since then...fortunately our apartment has a full guest room with a good bed so I'm not just couchin' it lol

The last day and a bit has just been me reeling with this...Like I genuinely believe she did this to make money and help us out, but there's the huge breach of trust. We've both been at our regular jobs today and yesterday so haven't had much time to talk. I just feel so exhausted. I tried to look at the twitter she made out of morbid curiosity but she already deleted it.

We both have Tuesday off and we decided we're going to have a serious day together to talk and work through this. How do I prepare myself for the possibility that there's more secret stuff she hasn't told me? How do we move past this and how do I secure myself that she is being honest?

tl;dr, title"
59,"My husband (21M) gets upset about the smallest inconveniences and it makes my(20F) day harder.


We ordered fried chicken. He forgot to tell them not to put in chicken breast. He got mad, so I tried to lighted the situation by saying ""Hey dont worry, they can change the order at the window"". When the KFC lady came to the window she already had prepared the food and that made him so mad. He told her to take out the chicken breast after and was fuming. 

He gets upset like this a lot. I have to pull him out of if and make the situation lighter. Like if he drops a glass I have to say ""Its okay well clean it together"" to avoid him getting mad and ignoring me for the rest of the day. 

Usually I dont mind doing it but he got so mad yesterday and I sighed and said to myself ""I cant do this anymore"" 
I suffer from mental health issues myself and I cant take on his huffing and puffing when tiny things go wrong. 

What do I do?

TLDR: husband gets mad over tiny things and ruins everyone's day."
60,"BF (M, 32) has become obsessed with Muay Thai recently. Today he said I (F, 33) couldn’t come to his training. I think it might be the end of us.


So my boyfriend of two years recently became majorly obsessed with Muay Thai, like trains twice a day, every day obsessed. It makes him really happy, he looks hot af- super ripped (lol) and it’s obviously very good for his fitness and health. Despite not seeing him as much as I’d like and feeling a bit neglected as a result of that, I do support it.
I read other advice posts on Reddit about girlfriends complaining about their bfs not spending time with them because of training/ being worried about the violence danger/aspect of the sport, which I also am to be honest. All the advice said to ask to go along to training. So I did, a few mins ago and he said and I quote “Oh I’ll just go to your gym instead” like basically saying no you are not invited. And then I was like “Eh what?” (We had talked about me going before) And he said right away  “There’s too many hot girls there”. I was the like WTF

He later claimed it was a joke. Like Ha ha?! Not. Now I’m salty af about all the time he spent away from me there now cos I think it just has to be a weird Freudian slip that he went straight for all the hot girls being there. Does that sound suspicious to you guys? 

Also fucking fuming at the too many hot girls as if I am not a hot girl. I feel like your boyfriend should think you are a hot girl, you know. Is that just madness or do I have a point? 

Most of all I’m hurt he basically doesn’t want to share the most important thing currently in his world with me. I seriously think this could be the end of us. I’ve felt bottom of his priority list for a while now and this just confirms it.

Am I overreacting? Or is this as bad as I feel it is? It feels kind of terminal to me. Any tips or anything would be appreciated.


Thanks

TLDR: If you don’t want to share your passions with someone you probably don’t love them! Legit or ridiculous? You decide"
61,"Boyfriend (28m) isn’t talking to me because I (25f) woke up “late”


To preface, we’ve been together for 4 years now and do not live together 

He recently started a new job where he starts work at 9am, but is usually there early. My job is supposed to be a 9-5 job but it’s very flexible. Sometimes I start late if I had a late night before. 

Today I was going in to work at 11, he texted me around 7:30am to say good morning and I texted when I woke up around 8:45am. He replied saying “ oh you wanna wake up now? It’s too late b*tch go back to sleep.”

I didn’t know what to reply. I said okay and then told him I didn’t like when he called me names. He hasn’t responded and it has been hours now. 

Tl;dr boyfriend isn’t talking to me because i woke up late. What gives?"
62,"Will our [22m] relationship recover after I had my girlfriend [20f] involuntarily detained


My girlfriend was showing signs of a mental illness, a very severe mental illness. 
She was erratic, irrational and I was actually very scared for her well being (and other people’s well-being) She was a complete stranger and it was not the girl I’ve known for 7 years.

I called the police and ambulance (as she was very hurt and in danger) she went absolutely crazy and I don’t think I’ve ever seen such betrayal in her face before.

Now here we are, they have a 72 hour hold on her while they do a psychiatric evaluation. 

I don’t think we are going to recover from this. I feel like she will not forgive me and will think Im out to get her. (She thought everyone is trying to kill her)  I sometimes regret calling them but I know she was in danger and I need to keep myself from over thinking about it too much.

Anyway, what do I do when she gets out? I haven’t actually spoken to her since they took her away. I’m not sure if she will even speak to me when she’s back. 

TLDR ; girlfriend has been involuntarily held against her Will because of signs of her mental illness. I don’t know if our relationship will ever recover from this. what do I say to her when I see her again?"
63,"I desperately need help diffusing a situation between my bride and her father...three days before the wedding. [Me:35/M Her:34/F Him:67/M, we have been dating for 2 years]


So, my fiancee has been dealing with the loss of her mom, sixteen months ago. Wedding planning has been very hard for her because of the loss of her mother, and things seemed relatively normal until about a month ago when her dad announced that he was dating a woman (who has been a family friend of theirs for \~40 years). They have been moving incredibly quickly, and he's acting like an infatuated teenager with this new woman... as in, he's a loose cannon. Seriously, he's already talked about proposing. An aside, her dad is otherwise a great guy.

So, there's been a tension as to whether or not he can bring her to the wedding, but his daughter, uncomfortable with the speed of his relationship, has been edging towards, ""It's a bad idea to have her at the reception."" Mostly because all he's been talking about for the past month is how he wants everybody at the wedding to meet his new girlfriend, and she's afraid he'll do something stupid if she's there.

Apparently he told the GF that she could come despite my fiancee saying no. After a small argument last night, her dad drove to the girlfriend's house to tell her that 'his daughter told her she couldn't come.' Which, led to a fight there, where the girlfriend said she needed time to think about the future, he needs to prioritize her over his kids and fight for her (also, we're talking about a wedding here and they've been dating a freakin' month...that's a huge red flag). 

So, of course, my fiancee, always a reconciler, felt like total shit last night, called me in tears because she may have been responsible for starting the fight that ended her dad's relationship... we talked through it, and things seemed better this morning. 

Until...

Her dad went out to lunch with his GF today, and called my fiancee afterwards. His first words were, ""We worked it out, but FYI, you two will probably always have a strained relationship after this"" and it basically sounds like he's, after one month of dating, already choosing his GF over his own family.  So, of course, my fiancee, three days before the wedding, is now an absolute wreck, and her dad is indifferent about it, he's just happy he worked things out with his GF, consequences be damned. I honestly haven't seen her this stressed / angry / sad since we've known each other. She feels like everything that's happened in this situation has snowballed, to the point that it's something major.

Any advice for what to say to her father / how to make this better for her? Nobody should have to put up with this shit three days before their wedding. I'm so close to calling her father and having a come to Jesus talk.

\-----------------------------------------

TL:DR - Fiancee's dad is dating a woman who wasn't invited to our wedding, things exploded as a result of her not being invited, now my fiancee's relationship with her dad is really strained three days before the wedding, she feels like her dad doesn't give a shit about her."
64,"1 My uncle [48M] wants me to give my [23F] cousin [25F] a place to live, even though I hate her.


WARNING LONG POST

My uncle James wants me to give his daughter, Ruby a place to live and get her a job at the supermarket where I am working. If Ruby were any other relative I would be willing to help, but Ruby herself is someone who I would never let stay under my roof.

I'll give a little bit of background about Ruby. She is ridiculously smart. She was discovered to be a very high IQ child, much smarter than anyone else her age. She completed A Levels at the age of 12 and got exceptional results, and made local headlines because of this. In spite of this she still stayed on at school so she could be with her friends, but the school brought in ''specialist'' university-level material to keep up with her ability. I was a fairly ''average'' student and my parents were always banging on about the fact that Ruby was so smart she needed her own special work whereas I was doing the same as anyone else.

Ruby's parents seemed to let the fact that they had a local celebrity for a daughter go to their heads. They completely spoiled her and gave her whatever she wanted. She used to pick on me at any family gathering and they used to laugh when I was crying, but if I did anything back (even just telling her to leave me alone) she would have a huge crying fit in front of everybody and her parents would demand that my parents ''control'' me.

Since we live nearby I ended up going to the same school as Ruby but was two years younger. Ruby is very pretty, and she had a gang of other pretty girls who used to follow her around. They used to torment other girls and humiliate them until they cried. Ruby would make of girls for their weight, their appearance, their clothes, anything she could use to upset someone. They frequently targeted people in the younger year groups including me and my friends. I had huge insecurity issues most of my teens due to Ruby and her friends.

Ruby ended up going to a top university like she was always going to. However, things ended badly when she was expelled for bullying and threatening a girl on her course who was dating a guy she liked.

Since Ruby has been back home she has been on a complete downward spiral. She started partying, drinking heavily, smoking weed and sniffing cocaine. This was a few years ago, but since then the drinking/drugs have really taken a toll on her mental health. She's still smart AF but she's now impulsive, paranoid and has these weird mood swings. She can literally switch on anyone over nothing. When my parents visited hers and told them that I was now a manager at the supermarket, she ran over from the other room and started screaming in my mums face not to rub her failures in her face, even though my mum didn't say anything about her or even know she was there. She's never had a job and is living off her parents money, using it to go out partying and to buy more drugs and alcohol. She has been in trouble with the police for drunk street fighting and her mum is on the phone to mine about the screaming matches they have.

I recently moved in with my boyfriend after my promotion. I love our place. We got a dog too and everything is great. Last week I got a phone call from Ruby's dad asking me to meet him for lunch. When I went he explained to me that he wanted Ruby to get some ''life experience'' and stop being dependent on them. He said he wanted me to help her get a job at the supermarket and also let her stay at our place. I told him I would consider it, but after all Ruby has done to me in the past, I'm do not want her living under my roof. I don't want her near me or my boyfriend at all, especially considering how unstable she's been in recent years. However, my parents have been urging me to say yes for some reason.

How do I say no in a way that doesn't make me seem like the bad guy?

TL;DR: My uncle wants me to let my cousin who tormented me for years live with me and my boyfriend, even though she is a mentally unstable troublemaker."
65,"I’m [24f] moving 20 minutes away, but my parents [50mf] are guilting me




I hope this is the right place to post for some advice on this issue! 

I’m [24f] moving out with my boyfriend [24m] of 3 years for the first time and my parents are guilt tripping me really hard. My partner and I both have full time careers that pay well and we have been saving significantly, we have no debt, so it’s not a question of if we can. The place is in the nice side of town full of people our age. I can afford the rent alone, and so can he, so it’s not a money question, it’s a personal issue: My parents really don’t want to see me go. The entire time I’ve been apartment hunting, my mom has told me I’m moving too far and told me I was stupid for renting and not buying a house near her, etc, so it has been stressful.

When I was in college, I lived at home during the main semesters and only lived at school for the summer. School was 7 miles away. I visited every weekend and it was no big deal. But my parents are saying I’m moving too far away. For reference, I’m moving to the other side of the city, 16 miles away from them. In high traffic, it’s maybe 50 minutes. In normal conditions, around 20. I explained that I’m still in the same area and will see them on the weekends and whenever! I also feel that they should make an effort to see me. They can drive, it’s not a limitation. It’s not like I’m leaving the state; I’m not even leaving the county! Yet my mom says it’s a bad choice and she says that my dad is not allowed to help me move either. Which is fine, I can handle the move myself. I just want my dad to still like me.

This move will mean my new commute to work is 5 minutes, I’ll be living near my friends, and able to really enjoy my 20s. Having a place to entertain and call my own is something I really desire, but I care about my parents even though I think they are being a little much on this one. I have two older siblings [30m and 26f] who moved out and live less than 4 miles away from my parents, so my parents want me to do the same. The part of town I’m moving to is an area I’m often at already, so I’m comfortable there. My mom is often very hard on me and my father, so I feel bad about leaving him alone to deal with her ways. But I think that I can’t live my life for anyone but me.  So am I being a bad person for wanting to move out? Any suggestions are appreciated! Sorry for the word salad!

Tl;dr: my parents think that me moving 16 miles across town is too far and our relationship is suffering because of it. Are they being irrational? Am I doing something wrong? Any idea how i can salvage the relationship and move out?"
66,"I (34M) still care about my gf (30F), but I think I've lost respect for her over her past affair.


TL;DR: GF had a (quasi?) affair with a married man before we dated, and I can't seem to get over it.

I've been seeing gf for about two years. Going in, I knew we had fairly different personalities; she had something of a wild streak, but I found that charming. Early on, she admitted to me that she had a relationship with a guy with a wife and kids before we met. She said that they dated off an on for more than a year and that there was some drunken kissing, but that things never went further than that. I didn't like it, but I was really into her and I rationalized it as a past mistake.

For the first year, things were going really well. Eventually we met each others' families and started talking about the future. But around that time, I found out that she was still texting with the guy in question. She didn't hide it; I actually found out because she asked if I would mind if she went out with him for drinks. From her perspective, she felt that she was emotionally over him, and had reverted back to the friendship they shared before the quasi-affair, so there was nothing wrong with staying in contact.

I was livid. I didn't want to give her an ultimatum, but I made it clear that the friendship made me uncomfortable. She agreed not to meet up with him, but said that she didn't want to give up a friendship with someone that she had known for years, and had many friends in common with.

Over the next couple of months, we talked it over a few times. I felt that we looked at this, and many things, differently, and I really wanted to understand where she was coming from, even if I couldn't ultimately accept it. She was adamant that she didn't want her partner to choose her friends, though, and refused to give him up completely. Finally, I couldn't take it. I got angry, and told her that I thought she was wrong, selfish, immature. It seemed to get through to her, and she finally cut off all contact with the guy.

For me, though, those months of back and forth really took a toll. I had really wanted that decision to come from her, not from me. I had been jealous of the guy, of course (who wants someone like that hovering around your relationship?), but more than that, it just changed how I saw her. The fact that she thought going out alone with a guy like that was okay, and tried to justify that to me, left me questioning her morals and values. I found myself becoming unfairly critical of her about unrelated things, and still harboring anger about the married guy.

Maybe breaking up would have been the right decision then, but I cared about her. We had just been on the cusp of committing to a future together before all this started, and I didn't want to give that up. I suggested that we try couples therapy. We went for a couple of months and talked through the issue. She was communicative and apologetic. She said that she regretted how she acted, that I had been right. She even went so far as to admit the possibility that she was still harboring some feelings for him at the time. We also talked about the fact that my family was broken up by an affair, leaving me with a pretty harsh reaction to it. It felt like things were getting better.

A few months have passed. We're not unhappy on a daily basis. But often, I still find myself ruminating about whether or not she's a moral person. And I can't seem to get back to the way I felt about her right before I found out that had still been in contact with the guy, that she didn't consider their relationship the moral mistake that I did.

I don't really want to break up, but she's waiting for a proposal. I know that I can't commit to marrying someone when I have this sort of nagging doubt about their morals, when I find myself sort of unconsciously feeling contempt for them sometimes. I think she thinks that we're over the issue, and bringing it up again would probably hurt her. But we're not that young, and I don't want to lead her on.

I don't know what to do. I don't want to punish her for a mistake that she's apologized for, but even though I can rationalize her actions, I can't control my emotional response to them. I've tried to work through it by talking with her, through therapy, and by waiting it out, but after months of this, that doubt is still there.

Am I a moralizing jerk? Should I continue to work on it and give it more time? Or should I accept that my core values aren't going to change, and that this is an unbridgeable gap between us?"
67,"I (19M) just found out that my girlfriend (26F) has been sh*t-talking the ring I made her for her birthday, and is planning on selling it


I don’t want this to drag on too long, but I’ve been dating my girlfriend for about a year now, and her birthday is in a few weeks. I made her a ring out of resin (with little flowers in it) quite a while in advance, and she found it while she was going through our drawers. 

I was hoping she’d be happy with it, but I’ve recently been informed by our mutual friends that she cried for hours because apparently “I don’t think she’s worth diamonds”. She’s also been calling me a “cheap loser” and she plans on selling the ring on eBay (from what our friends have told me). Her best friend told me today that she threw a full-blown tantrum over the ring.

Is what she has done too much to forgive her for? I’m considering just buying her a diamond ring to appease her.

TL;DR: Made a resin flower ring for gf’s birthday, she hates it and is shit-talking, crying, having tantrums, and threatening to sell it. Should I give in and buy her a new ring, or just live with my mistake?"
68,"I ""broke up"" with a friend of over 20 years as he seems to be ""losing it"", and I'm not sure if I did the right thing.


I (40m) ended a 26 year friendship with someone (40m) I've known since high school. I have very mixed feelings about this, and although I don't have a specific question I'm hoping for some feedback. This is going to be a long post. Sorry.

When I started high school I was the new kid in town. We moved to the town where my mom grew up after my parents divorced and my mom decided to go back to college. We moved in with my grandparents, which was a place I had spent quite a bit of time as a child. Having been there every Christmas and nearly every summer vacation I had a couple of friends in the neighborhood, so I wasn't entirely friendless when school started. I also quickly became friends with a guy in my art class who played D&amp;D and invited me to play. That's how I met Gary (not his real name). He was our DM and he was incredibly smart, funny, mean spirited, arrogant, and a bit of a pervert. In other words, the perfect Dungeon Master. I liked him right away. 

Gary was always extremely judgmental of everyone and couldn't seem to maintain relationships for very long as no on could ever meet his expectations. As an example, he developed an absolute hatred of one of our good friends because he didn't like that the girls he dated tended to be on the heavier side. Over the years people began to question me as to why I was still friends with him, but I always defended him and stuck by him. Sure he was mean but that was also part of what made him so funny and he always cracked me up whenever we hung out together. 

When we went off to college I went to a local state school and he went to a fairly prestigious university in another state. We always kept in touch and I considered him to be one of my best friends, even as our paths diverged. He studied law and became an attorney, I studied art and became a tattooist. He loved sports cars, I rode Harleys. Through all the years we maintained a great friendship, but it wasn't always easy. In our 20s and into our 30s I worked as bouncer in various bars in the evenings and worked as a tattoo artist during the day. As such, I was well known and quite liked in the bar scene and could get into any show I wanted, bartenders would buy me drinks, and people in general knew me and treated me well. Gary was a bit amazed by this and really enjoyed coming to visit and getting the VIP treatment, but his judgmental attitude and arrogance caused a lot of people to dislike him and they would ask me why I was friends with him. I would just say that we were old friends and once you get to know him he's a great guy. 

Gary decided that he wanted to buy a tattoo shop with me. I made it clear that I didn't think that I was cut out to be a business man, but if he wanted to do the back office clerical work I would manage the shop and we could split the profits 50/50. This arrangement didn't go as smoothly as planned. Right after we bought the shop he decided that he no longer wanted to practice law and quit the firm where he had only recently become partner to work as a delivery driver. His midlife crisis was exaggerating the worst aspects of his personality. Whenever Gary would come to visit he would say things to our female artists and even female clients that bordered on sexual harassment, to the point where I would have to escort him away from the premises. He also tended to make really nasty remarks about people's tattoos, particularly if they were in places where they were not easily covered like hands or necks. He was just being brutally judgmental and mean to everyone for no good reason. Our artists hated him and no one wanted to come in to work if he was going to be there. 

By this time I had gotten married and my wife and I had bought a little 3 acre farm in the country. I no longer went to bars, I would come home right after work and get up at 6 am to do chores. When you've spent over a decade dealing with drunks and fights every night, there is something particularly delightful about growing a nice perfectly ripe tomato. Unfortunately this meant an end to Gary's VIP treatment downtown. I think that and the growing alienation at the shop as well as the general downward spiral he was in made him want out. He told me that he was done and wanted to sell his ownership in the company. I offered to buy him out over time, but he demanded that he wanted a lump sum. Having recently purchased property, I wasn't in a position to borrow more money so I brought it up to my former apprentice who was able to get the financing. I asked Gary if he would help me with the back office stuff, as none of that was familiar to me and he agreed. Our deal was that I would continue to give him any tattoos he wanted if he would continue to help me learn to do the books and file reports with the state, etc. Needless to say, he never did anything to help me take over his former role in the company, a role I knew from the beginning that I was ill suited for and would be tedious to learn. 

It was a difficult process to disentangle him from the business as he had opened most of our accounts in his name. Many of those accounts were understanding when I explained the situation to them, that Gary is no longer with the company and I need to be made the primary account holder. There were however 2 accounts that I was unable to alter. One was a lease for office equipment, the other was our business line of credit. I asked him repeatedly to remove himself from those 2 accounts. 

That was 8 months ago. About 3 weeks ago Gary texted to say that he was removing himself from our credit account and to watch for a letter that I would need to sign and return in order to finally take ownership of the account. I was quite pleased that this matter would finally be settled and looked forward to signing the letter. Unfortunately the letter never came. Just the other day I was at the bank to do a deposit and asked for my credit statement as I hadn't received it in the mail and wanted to make a payment. I was told that the account had been closed. I was worried because we have a couple of automatic payments that come out of that account and I didn't want to miss a payment. I was also concerned  about closing an account with a standing balance as this is terrible for my credit rating. I was told that in order to maintain the account Gary would have to reopen it, stating  that it had been closed accidentally, then he could remove himself from the account. I emailed him that information and he responded with a message that took me completely by surprise:

 ""I’m not going to reopen the credit card account. With all due respect, you’ve known about this since last August, and thus you’ve had eight and a half months to take care of it. I’ve also asked you to make the account change a number of times. The last time I texted you was almost a month ago. How long did you expect me to wait? How many more times was I going to have to pester you about this?  Also, why should I be the one to fix it?  We're at this point because of you, not me.  As for your automatic payments, that’s not my problem. You put them on the card and then failed to change the account name.  Your responsibility, your problem.  I'm done dealing with this, and I'm done contending with your negligence.""

At first I thought that he was joking, or that he was losing his mind. I'm the one who has been pestering him to make the changes to the account. I've tried to put the account in my name and I couldn't because he was the account holder and it could only be done by him. It could literally ONLY be done by HIM! To be told that it was my negligence infuriated me. I emailed him back that our association had come to an end and that I never wanted to see or speak to him again. 

I have never ended a friendship before. I've drifted apart from friends or just lost interest and stopped talking to them, but I've never ""broken up"" with a friend. It feels strange, he's a toxic asshole and I'm sure not having him in my life will relieve me of some anxiety, but I worry that he is in a downward spiral that is self destructive and I know I'm one of very few people (like, literally his parents, me, one other friend who uses him for money, and his World of Warcraft guild) who care about him. I'm not sure if ending the friendship was the right thing to do.

TL/DR: Lifelong friendship sours amidst one friends midlife crisis downward spiral. Not sure if I did the right thing."
69,"I (21F) get weird vibes from best friends (21F) fiance (30M); should I still participate in their wedding?


Best friend ""Brandy"" and I have been close since elementary school. We have a very close friendship, and shes truly my sister not just my best friend. She met ""Daniel"" (30M) when we were about 11 and he was 20 while he was volunteering at our school at the after school program. She had a crush on him from the start and they flirted a lot which always made me uncomfortable because he was so old. We stopped going to after school in 6th grade and didn't see him until our freshman year of high school, where he worked as a tutor. This time they started legitimately dating despite it being illegal in many ways, and Daniel came close to losing his job at the school because rumors started to spread. I finally confronted Brandy on the situation and told her that it was weird and inappropriate, and we fought so hard that we didn't talk for nearly a year. 


We reconciled after they broke up and he quit his job, and to my knowledge they didn't talk until last year. Sometime last year they started talking again, and now have been dating for 6 months. Brandy told me last week that Daniel proposed and that they'll be getting married in November. So many things about their relationship worries me and sets off red flags, and the fact that Daniel is pushing a wedding and they're trying for a baby is not normal.

I've been on double dates with them a couple times as well as had them over to my apartmemt and the way Daniel acts towards Brandy is creepy to say the least. If me and her are having a private conversation he has to come and butt in and harass her. If we're in the kitchen getting drinks or snacks for longer than a minute hes calling down the hallway ""babe, what're you doing in there?"" He makes fun of her and tries to scare her, but she assures me that that's just how they play around. Hes very condescending and comes off as controlling; a lot of the things Brandy and I used to do like going on late night walks for slurpees or night drives to the beach is now off the table because Daniel doesn't like it. Hes constantly nitpicking stupid things like mismatched socks or lipstick on her teeth and calling her immature. Hes never been explicitly mean, just *weird*, and I worry that him pushing marriage and kids so quickly is because he wants to lock her down before he shows his true colors. 


I don't like Daniel, and I'm concerned. I worry that if I say anything to Brandy or bow out of the wedding we will never talk again, and that worries me because I'm pretty much her only friend and she isn't close with her family so if he becomes abusive she'll have no one to turn to, but i feel like by participating in the wedding I'm endorsing this weird relationship. What do I do? Should I pretend to be okay with things so I can continue being there if she needs me? I've read a lot about abusive relationships and I know that if I'm a threat to Daniel he'll convince her to cut me off, and if things get bad I don't want that to happen. What do I do?


Tl;dr: best friends fiance creeps me out and seems potentially abusive. Should I stay in the wedding party as the maid of honor or bow out because i don't agree with their relationship?"
70,"My [24F] dad is dying. My boss and her wife brought us some food to show sympathy. Uncle told them not to come back because they’re gay.


My dad is in home hospice dying of cancer. It’s extremely difficult for me but I am trying to be strong for him. My uncle is taking it really hard, made worse by him not having a good relationship with my dad. 

I have worked in a store for a few years and my boss is a very kind person. She’s married to a girl. They cooked my family some food and dropped by to show sympathy (my boss also knows my dad). 

Well, my uncle is very religious. He didn’t say anything at first and I didn’t expect him to, but when they were about to leave he basically told them to not come back. He framed it as “this is a Christian household and we don’t believe in that stuff”. I told him to shut the hell up. My boss was really upset, but she just gave me a hug and left. I told her to come back anytime and we would deal with him. I apologized profusely and I think she knows me well enough to know that I don’t subscribe to that stuff and am attracted to other women too. 

I think this is just his way of coping with my dad dying, so I’m trying to have some compassion. But they were just trying to do something nice and he even jeapordized my relationship with my boss. But this is unacceptable and a conflict none of us need right now. 

What should I do from here? 

**tl;dr** my uncle told my boss she’s unwelcome in our home while my dad is dying because she is gay."
71,"My husband (27M) is bored of who I (26F) am now


So I'm pretty new to full time work. Until a year ago I was in grad school and before that college, so I always had a flexible schedule. Now I work a 9-5 job and as a result I've changed. 

I used to have a lot of hobbies , some were dabbled in and others I was really into. Now with a full time job I don't really have any interest in them anymore. I live a simple life now. I go to work, come home, make dinner, watch TV, go to sleep. I know to a lot of people it sounds monotonous but honestly I'm content. I don't have the desire for any more. 

My husband has been getting bored lately and keeps asking about hobbies I used to do. I don't know what to tell him. It's not like they were common hobbies we did, just stuff I did for myself. I'm a good wife to him otherwise. But lately he's been dissatisfied and I'm starting to worry. We've only been married 2 years! 

How can I communicate this with him? I'm not sad, my hobbies have just changed. Still the same old me! 

**Tl;Dr my husband doesn't like the life I lead now that I've transitioned to full time work**"
72,"My (33F) husband (35M) called me pathetic and now I’m questioning if he is right and how to move forward


My husband and I have been together 10 years, married for 6. We have definitely had our ups and downs, and he can be very vindictive and mean when he is angry. I have told him before that it is not ok to me for him to be purposefully mean, no matter how angry he is. Things have been rough recently as we have a two month old baby and we also just moved. He has been very helpful and has picked up a lot of slack over the course of my pregnancy/recovery, for which I have been thankful. However, the reason he called me pathetic is that he says I am “just not good” at being a mom and wife. This was so hurtful to me. We have two kids under two and this has been an adjustment, so things like laundry and unpacking have not been high on my priority list since we moved in. But if there is one thing I know I am good at it is taking care of my kids. 
All this started because he was mad that I woke him up from a nap to ask for help getting dinner together while the baby was screaming and the two year old was running around. Now, he had worked hard the last couple days out of town, but he slept in until 11:30 and then napped from 4-6, and I let him sleep without bothering him, so I didn’t feel like this was asking too much. He says that he “can’t be 24/7 dad” and that basically he should be able to do whatever he wants (nap) without me “bothering” him. This frustrates me because I don’t have a choice but to be 24/7 mom! He seems to think that staying home and taking care of two kids is a walk in the park and that I’m pathetic for not getting more done during the day while he’s gone or for needing his assistance when he is home. He acts like he is doing me a favor by helping with the kids or things around the house since he works and I am at home with the kids right now (maternity leave). I can’t stop thinking about him saying this and wondering if he genuinely feels this way. And either way, if he feels like I’m pathetic or if he just said that to hurt me, I don’t know how to get past the hurt that I’m feeling because of it. He is not one to apologize, usually in the heat of the moment he just doubles down on whatever mean thing he said, and then after a day or two he just acts like nothing happened. I don’t think I will be able to do that this time. I want our relationship to work and don’t want a divorce, so I’m not looking for comments like “you should leave him.” 

How can I move past this and set boundaries about the way he talks to me in the future? Does he have a right to be upset that I spend most of my time/energy taking care of our kids and have slacked on house stuff? 

TL;DR - My husband really hurt my feelings, will probably act like nothing happened, and I don’t know how to move forward productively."
73,"I (18F) feel isolated and alone. My twin (18F) is having the time of her life at my expense.


Hi everyone, I hope you're all having a great weekend! Like the title says, I'm just feeling really isolated and alone. And to make matters worse my identical twin is having the time of her life right now while I'm stuck in my room. 

Some info: my sister depends on me heavily when we socialise with new people. It's always the same formal. I want to meet new people, she shames me saying all I do is embarrass her, finally step up and talk to someone, she starts talking to them, insults and knitpicks everything I say and do and who I am as person, new found acquaintance sees how my own sister treats me and does the same, she becomes preferred, seen as the cool out going one while I'm the terrible lousy sister of her and finally I am just left in the dust. Wondering if it's something I said, is it because I'm the ugly one, why don't they like me?

It's been like this for years and for years to come. We get a guy friend, she rips me apart and then gets with him. Which is fine, but I get pushed to the role of ""oh my girlfriend's sister"" and when they break up I become ""Fuck, my ex's sister"". Not the friend I used to be, even if my sister made it about her. Also I am not allowed to talk to them as my sister says I am betraying her and even compared it to her talking to the nearly grown man sexual harasser stalker I had as a 15 year old. As if that is any way comparable. Going on to say she won't be my sister anymore if I talk to my previous friends. I told her what she does to me is hurtful and restricting me isn't fair, but she just explodes in my face, says hurtful things and just carries on. 

I live in a small town and go to a tiny, tiny school and I don't do group activities as a hobby. I love poetry and art for example. I have no problem speaking to people, I just don't know how to find them. I feel so socially inept and I just wish I could make friends outside of my sister. All my internet friends say I'm cool and at this point it's hard to believe it. How come these amazing ans kind people love spending time with me through a dinky screen but no one in person? It's gotten to the point where I don't want to be around people because I get ripped to shreds with insults and passive aggressive comments. And I am going to be with her in uni for another 4 to 7 years. My heart is literally hurting while typing this. My parents are totally disinterested in my qualms. 

Please help me reddit, I don't know what to do. I know I'm just some sad, desperate kid but I just need some advice. Sorry if this annoying or not in the right sub.

TL;DR: My twin insults me in front of any and all friends/potential friends so they like her more and look better. How do I meet people outside of this? I feel so socially inept."
74,"My GFs (24F) dogs are ruining my (27M) apartment and it's very draining


This is a long one tl;dr is at the bottom.

As the title says my GF brought two Chihuahuas with her when she moved in, this was roughly 7/8 months ago. I knew that this was always going to be the case and made it clear that they had to be house trained. It has since became apparent that they are not.

Since they have moved in we have had to work on the best place for them to stay that's easy to keep clean and warm. There has been a lot of trial and error here. First the bed room which I didn't like (I have sensitive skin and the dog hair in bed was affecting it). Second the kitchen as it was easy to clean - the dogs didn't like this it isn't as warm as the other rooms. Finally the sitting room with a pen and some pads. It's warm and the pads make it easy to clean meaning everyone is happy. 

To get to the crux of the issue all of these ideas where driven by me. It has became apparent that my GF was fine with them freely rooming and frankly making the house stink. I shall put out a disclaimer i never had dogs growing up. Multiple members of my family did which I would visit often. All of their houses smelt fine not like pee. 

Currently i work roughly 50 hours a week where as my GF works 16. I've been off for a week and been in charge of the dogs. As such the house has smelt fine. I will admit it does take a bit of work. 

Multiple times i have came home to a house that stinks on days that my GF has been off. I'm finding it very tiring and feeling like she isn't pulling her weight. I do a lot of the other house hold chores along with pay all the bills. I'm not certain if i am being unfair. I love her and want to spend my life with her...I'm not so sure on the dogs.

I'm looking for advice from anyone that's been in this situation as it is putting a strain on the relationship. 

tl;dr I feel like my GF is allowing her dogs to stink up the apartment and it's straining our relationship."
75,"My (24f) father (62m) just got a kidney transplant and is home too soon and i am absolutely burnt out trying to care for him 24/7 while working. I just scrubbed diarrhea out of the carpets and Im at my wits end.


My mother died when i was a baby and my dad stopped taking care of himself and got sick. He had my sister and i to take care of and worked himself to the edge of death. My sister is two years older and is a nurse who works overnights. I work three minutes away elsewhere. I am NOT a nurse and am squeamish and have a strong dislike for injecting people with needles and seeing poop and other similar things.   


He had the transplant last week after being on a list for 7 years. there were complications and he needs to have a catheter in his penis to let the kidney drain his urine constantly. I have to empty his pee bags multiple times a day.

&amp;#x200B;

Heres a list of the things ive been doing and have been trying to get used:

\- dress his 12 inch long wound

\-saw his newly circumsized penis because he is often unclothed and doesnt realize

\-learned how to inject his insulin because he is unable to and have to do it 4 times a day. 

\-injecting finger to take blood sugar multiple times a day

\-medications multiple times a day

\-running back and forth to the store whenevr he needs more meds, ensure, foods.

\-cook all of his meals 

\-clean and make sure evrything is sterilzed at all times

\-help him get dressed

\-empty his urine bags multiple times a day

\-deal with emotional abuse if i take too long to do anything 

\-rush home from work if he calls me and needs something immediately. ex: if his sugar is super low and needs a snack

\-blood pressure and weight numerous times a day

\-drive him to and from appointments a few times a week early in the morning and am usually out for 4 hours at a time. 

\-and now SCRUB DIARRHEA OUT OF THE CARPET AND KITCHEN FLOOR because he had an accident on the way to the BR

I feel unable to be out of the house or far away because of all of this. I am extremely stressed out and i am the only one who lives with him. My sister lives nearby and is also helping but only when she can. She will stop by for a few hours at a time when available but works and sleeps during the day.

&amp;#x200B;

I AM SO OVERWHELMED AND DONT KNOW WHAT TO DO. I feel terrified to ask him if we can get him an aid or something because he will take it as an attack and tell me how selfish i am. Please help me i am so desperate and have been strugging with panic attacks due to this all.

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR: 62 year old dad is unable to care for himself after kidney transplant and i am extremely burnt out after only 5 days. Worried it will be like this for awhile and am afraid to bring up getting an aid because he will call me selfish."
76,"My [17m] mom [47f] hates my half sister [15f] or something, but she doesn't want to talk about it. What should I do?


We had an event at school and she was in a good mood until she saw dad and my sister, then she changed and gave her a really uninterested ""Hi"".

I didn't know my sister was coming but it wasn't a problem or anything that she did come. During the event (in the theater) my mom was on my side and my sister and dad were on the other. I chatted a lot with my sister but mom barely said anything.

After that she was quiet on the ride back home. I asked her why she was in a bad mood and she said it was nothing. I asked if it was because ""they"" were there and told me to ""stop"", so I did.

I don't know how things happened exactly, but they divorced a little over one year after my sister was born (I randomly found the docs on the internet while goofing around searching for our names, it was really bizarre but I read the whole thing since mom would never talk about it).

So, what's going on? I assume mom got cheated on or something and my sister was born and they divorced, right? I don't expect mom to get along super well with my sister but it felt wrong that she would barely acknowledge her. I mean it's not her fault to have been born.

Should I talk to my mom about it or let it go and kinda not have them together ever again?

**tl;dr:** Mom apparently got moody or angry my half sister appeared during a school event. She doesn't want to talk about it. Should I ask for an explanation?"
77,"My parent’s [35M]/[57F] age gap is really bothering me [17F] and it’s affecting my relationship with my mother, I’m not sure what to do


My relationship with my mother and father are really great, except that I have been a little distant towards my mother lately. I’ve always known my mom was older than my dad by a lot, and it really mostly started bothering me now that I can really comprehend it. My mom is already 57 while my dad is only 35 years old. I’m not going to lie, they have a very good marriage, my they make each other really happy, and they have raised me to be a good person.

They are both reallt succesful and I have noticed how much they have helped each other but something about their age gap hurts my feelings. It makes me feel somewhat ashamed, sad, and very hurt, but I cannot explain why. It’s made me distant with my mother and I wish I could talk with her about it, but she’s a really sensitive person and I don’t want to make her feel shameful of herself and I don’t want to cause any problems with their marriage. Please guys any advice would really help me out.

TL;DR I have been feeling bad about my parents’ age gap relationship and I don’t know how to handle it"
78,"Me (26F) and my boyfriend (32M) of 3 years disagree on ""boy's trips"". I'm starting to think I might be too controlling.


Throwaway account, because my boyfriend knows my main. 

&amp;#x200B;

My boyfriend and I have been dating for 3 years, and are in the process of buying a house together. I love him very much, and while we have our ups and downs, overall, I'm the happiest I've ever been with him. 

&amp;#x200B;

All of his friends have just gotten out of long term relationships, but are generally pretty good guys. They party incredibly hard, and are regularly the last ones in the club. My boyfriend can't drink or do drugs due to a health issue, but will still shut down the clubs with his friends. 

&amp;#x200B;

I, on the other hand, do not enjoy going out to bars and clubs. I don't drink or do drugs and don't love huge crowds of drunk people. I'm all for having a good time, and will make an appearance, but after a few hours, I've had my fill and am ready to head home. 

&amp;#x200B;

Last year, my boyfriend and I got into a major fight because a boy's trip he went on was billed to me as something entirely different than it turned out to be; I was told they were going to the ""chill"" part of Ibiza, and would just be relaxing on the beach and spending time together... totally cool with that. What it turned into was clubbing til 5 am, pool parties and coke (which my boyfriend swears he didn't partake in, and I believe). Most frustratingly to me, is they met up with a group of girls for several days in a row, and his friends all hooked up with the girls, apart from him (which I also believe). He told me the hook ups all happened at clubs, and specifically happened in a club bathroom. I thought it was gross, and I was less than impressed with the trip. To me, it's really immature, and not something that someone in a committed, mature relationship should have any desire to do. It's not that I don't trust him not to cheat, it's just that I don't want my partner engaging in what I consider sleezy/immature behavior. He agreed that at times, he felt like the 7th wheel or babysitter, but that he still enjoyed doing things with his friends and was really hurt that I was labelling the trip as a drug/sex trip and not a time for him to spend with his friends. 

&amp;#x200B;

Recently though, he let slip that the girls they had been hanging out with had actually come back to their apartment, and that the hook ups happened there. I told him immediately that I was upset because being dishonest about what went on doesn't build trust, and I said that behavior like that feels disrespectful to our relationship. He said ""what, am I supposed to not go out to clubs if they want to go? Am I supposed to tell them they can't have girls over to our apartment?"" and I said ""well, by making it a boy's trip, they've essentially said you can't have me over... I don't see how that's any different."" He didn't want to talk about it anymore. 

&amp;#x200B;

Since that trip to Ibiza, he's been on boy's trips skiing, to a stag and away for a guy's only long weekend celebrating a 30th birthday. None of these trips have caused any issues. 

&amp;#x200B;

The major issue is that he has another boy's trip coming up, this time to Vegas with the same guys (all still single, apart from one that regularly cheats on his long term girlfriend). He said to me that he wants to discuss the trip and isn't going to go if it's going to cause fights between us, and I said I want him to do what he wants; I don't ever want to stop him from hanging out with his friends or going somewhere he wants to go, and that it will undoubtedly make me uncomfortable, but that's my own thing to deal with. He asked if I understood why he felt upset that I immediately labeled the trip a drug/sex holiday, and I said that I didn't really; single guys go to Vegas to do drugs, party and meet girls. He brought up the same argument that undoubtedly they would meet girls and some of them would hook up but that's not why he's going and it's hurtful I can't see that. He also said it feels like I don't trust him. I feel badly that I've hurt him and that it feels like I don't trust him. I told him that I do trust him, but it's hurtful to me that he'd rather spend a week abroad partying with his friends and chilling with other girls than with me. 

&amp;#x200B;

Am I being too harsh here? Is it unrealistic to expect a man in a serious relationship to not engage in behavior like that ? I don't want to be controlling, but I'm starting to feel like maybe I'm being too demanding. 

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR: My boyfriend wants to go on a boy's trip to Vegas with his single friends after an unsavory boy's trip to Spain with the same group. I'm not sure if I'm being controlling by getting upset that he still participates in stuff like this, or if it's fair to expect that my boyfriend grows up a bit?"
79,"My (34M) wife (33F) sometimes reacts badly toward me initiating sex. She says it takes up too much of her time and she rather be productive.


Now, this isn't exactly what you think it is. We normally have a very active sex life of sex maybe every other day sometimes more. 

Now my wife is doing her pussy graduate degree and she's got a lot of work these days. As such, we went whole week without sex.

She has a project due tomorrow and was supposed to finish last night as we have (well had) a friend's barbecue to attend today.

Yesterday I casually and jokingly mentioned that I've been horny all week but didn't initiate sex because I knew she was busy.

She then admitted she's been very horny too and it led to us having sex for 2 hours in the afternoon. We had dinner then she went too complete her project while I watched Netflix.

She then tells me an hour later that she's still horny. This led to us having more sex again for almost 2 hours.

Btw 2 hours includes everything from start to finish, I'm not some super stamina man. Also, she loves long sex sessions where it's a lot of for play teasing, eating her out, different positions etc.

So we ended up falling asleep. This morning she wakes up in the worst mood yelling at me for making her so horny yesterday and distracting her.

She had to cancel going to her friends barbecue so she could finish up her project.

Now this isn't the first time, it seems like she never thinks about the consequences of long sex. And she has to have long sex otherwise she bitches she isn't fulfilled (clearly the first 2 hour session didn't fulfill her).

I'm confused as to how to incorporate her regular schedule. I don't like planned sex but if it comes to that then i guess I'll survive.

But my thoughts are, how does she get off blaming me for this? She can't blame her sex drive on me? And I didn't force her to have sex especially the second time, I asked her a few times if she's sure she could spare the time.

How do I fix this? It honestly seems when she's horny she loses all self control. This is far from the first time and what happens is that as soon sex is over she guilts me, saying we shouldn't have and she really couldn't afford the time.

Tldr;
Wife blames me for distracting her with sex."
80,"Husband has been lying &amp; paying for custom porn.


My husband (M,30) and I (F,26) have been together for 6 years, married for 4 of those come June. When we first started getting serious, I discovered one day that he was engaging in live cams - essentially watching women perform sex acts, some that he requested and paid money for. On top of this, he had an EXTENSIVE collection of porn. I was very hurt and brought it up to him. We were considering marriage at this point, and he was partaking in this stuff almost daily. We had a great sex life so I didn't understand. He called it an addiction and I told him that I could not marry a porn addict. He sold his hard drive full of porn, promised me that he wouldn't ever do this again, and we moved on. I think it's important to note that he has a fetish that can only be fulfilled with/by a pregnant woman. I was able to 'induce' this fetish after all this happened, and things were great for a while. While we were engaged, I got pregnant and we were ecstatic! I came to realize how deep his fetish was while I was pregnant - but I was getting basically worshiped and he treated me so well. Throughout the years, we've had a couple conversations about porn, and my attitude towards it has shifted. We've made a ton of videos of our own, and he's helped me restore some self confidence, which has made our sex life great. I also have friends in the sex industry and that helped shape my views a bit. Anytime I asked him how we was doing with his addiction, he said it was fine and he was feeling good.

Fast forward to last night. He went to bed a little earlier than normal, and said he was just really tired. Once I came to bed later, I noticed his phone was on my side of the bed - not plugged in &amp; charging on his nightstand like normal. I picked it up and went to plug it in when I saw a notification from Reddit pop up. The username in this notification was in line with his fetish, so I opened it up. 20 minutes of looking led me to find that he's right back where he was. He's watching porn regularly, and chatting with &amp; paying hundreds of dollars to women for custom made videos. I'm talking paragraphs of detail that he'll send to them with instructions on what to do/say. One woman in particular had much more chat history. I found that while he &amp; I were on a romantic vacation to the islands - he was chatting with her almost the whole week. He sent her a picture with his umbrella drink as a 'toast to her' while I was sitting right beside him on the beach. It makes me feel like anytime he approached me for sex on the trip, he did with her in mind.

I didn't know what to do - I couldn't sleep so I just woke him up and calmly confronted him. We talked for almost 45 minutes. He broke down and said he knows it's wrong and he knows he has a problem. He said this fetish it an 'itch he needs scratched'. He said he's been feeling awful about himself and depressed and that led him to indulge in this stuff again too. He compared it to cheating on me, because we've been through this before. I told him that I'm hurt and I won't do this again. I'm not sure what to do at this point. I just feel numb and hurt and like everything I do isn't enough. The past few months have felt like him &amp; I were on top of the world. Communication is great, sex is great, daily life is great, and now this happens.

I've thought about counseling, taking a break, walking away, etc. I'm not looking for a hard &amp; fast solution, maybe just some input from others. It felt really good to get this off my chest. I'm open to questions - I guess I just really need someone to talk to. Thanks in advance.

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR -My husband's porn addiction has crept up again, but worse this time. I've confronted him about it and I'm not sure how to move forward."
