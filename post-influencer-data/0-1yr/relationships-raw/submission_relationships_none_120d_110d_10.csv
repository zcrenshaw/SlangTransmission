0,"My(24f) dad (56m) committed suicide about 2 weeks ago and Im having a hard time grieving and being in school. I don't want to drop out. (UPDATE)


Hi everyone, my last post wasnt super popular or anything but I just thought I'd update you guys anyways!

About a month ago, I went back to school a week after my dad died, and obviously the last few weeks have been super hard. It took me awhile but I ended up getting back on my feet, ultimately school has become one of my biggest outlets as far as keeping myself busy goes. I ended up passing all my classes with all A's and B's and I'm on track to graduate this fall.

Thank you to everyone who believed in me and encouraged me to keep going. Its people like you that really helped me get through one of the hardest chapters of my life.. and too everyone who didn't I understand you were coming from a good place.

Life can be really fucking hard, so sometimes you just have to take the small victories where you can.

# TL;DR I didnt drop out and I passed all my classes"
1,"My (F22) boyfriend (M31) of three years won’t stop using dating apps. I think it’s time for me to leave.


Since we met my boyfriend has been on and off of tinder, I’ve been very clear that it hurts me but he always defended it as just him ‘wanting an ego boost’. A few months ago we had a major argument about it where I threatened to leave and I honestly thought that was going to be the end of it. Pretty naive, really. Also I should note his ex before me left him for this very reason- I feel like an idiot for thinking he’d ever change. 

Today I woke up and realised he’d been using my phone and his email was logged in. I noticed he’d gotten an email from an app called hinge- just to give you an idea of the kind of app this is, the description read: ‘the app that was designed to be deleted’. Great. My stomach instantly dropped. I logged into it with his phone number and he’s put up profile pictures of him that I’ve taken when we’ve been on days out together?! In his description he’s got things like ‘we’ll get along if you like Chinese and have a dog, if you’re silly and comfortable and over share’. He’s also put in as a strict preference that he wants to be matched with hindus/muslims only. I’m white british. 

I knew something was going on yesterday but wasn’t sure what, he was acting differently and it was making me so anxious. He had the nerve to tell me that I must just be hormonal? I think the worst part about it is his reaction to all of this- he heard me crying, acted concerned and then saw me with his phone, at which point he just took it from me and went back to bed. That was about an hour ago and the only interaction I’ve had with him since was him asking me to open the bathroom door... not to see if I was okay, but because he needed to pee. This post sounds like a joke at this point. 

I’m obviously hurt by the fact that he’s on this thing but I think I’m more shocked by his total lack of guilt or response to me being upset. I’m so angry and there’s nothing I can do with it- I’m so embarrassed about the situation I don’t want to tell my family/friends how he’s treated me, and I can’t even talk to him about it because he’s refusing to address anything’s wrong, he’s still in bed. I don’t know what to do. He’s brought my self esteem down so much that I feel like I can’t be without him, but I know i can’t stay in this situation. Should I even bother trying to talk to him or should I just leave? I’ve taken screenshots of everything and initially I was going to send them to his family but thought against it. The thing is, if I just leave there’s literally zero consequences for him. He gets what he wants, he gets the freedom to go on random dates with no guilt. It just seems so fucking unfair that I’m the one left heartbroken and he gets to party up. 

I know the majority of replies are going to tell me to leave, and I can’t argue with you there. But how do I quell this need for closure/revenge? 

TLDR: caught my boyfriend of three years on another dating app, he’s refusing to even acknowledge the fact that I’m upset. Don’t know what to do."
2,"My [21F] boyfriend's [24M] flatmate [24F] acts like I'm the other woman


I'm going to use a throwaway for all the usual reasons.

&amp;#x200B;

I've been dating my boyfriend, who I'll call Tim, for two years. We're both students at the same university - I'm finishing my degree soon, and he is doing a PhD. He is currently living on campus, and I am living with my friends. Our relationship is happy and healthy, and to get in this before I see it in a comment, there is definitely no chance that Tim is cheating in this situation.

&amp;#x200B;

Tim lives in a accommodation block where four solo flats share one kitchen. All of his other 'flatmates' are PhD students. One of these is 'Lisa'. Everyone in the block moved in at the start of the academic year. My boyfriend did not know Lisa before they were randomly allocated the same corridor, and both intend to live there for the whole three years of their degrees. She was completely fine with both me and our relationship for the first few months. When I first met Lisa she was in a long term relationship (6+ years) with a guy she knew from her home town. Just before Christmas they split up, and following the break there was a sudden change in how she was acting around Tim. She wasn't necessarily flirty, but she started calling him by the same obscure pet name that I use for him - he immediately asked her to stop for obvious reasons, but she still called him generic 'coupley' names, even around me. We assumed that she was just struggling with being single for the first time in her adult life, since she never actually tried to make a move on Tim. After a while she started casually dating, and continues to do this now.

&amp;#x200B;

Despite her moving on romantically, Lisa still aims to treat Tim like a boyfriend in a practical sense. She tries to get Tim to take her out for dinner and go on days out, even though Tim has made it clear that he's not got time to socialise as much as she would like. Whenever I am around, even if it's just for a cup of tea between study times, she will stomp around the kitchen huffing and puffing like I'm interrupting their time together. We were cooking dinner together once (a very rare occurrence given our busy schedules) and she sat in the kitchen the whole time saying nothing and glaring at me. It's often the case now that if we want to see each other we stay at my house, though this isn't beneficial for my equally busy housemates/friends.

&amp;#x200B;

The reason I am writing this post is because it was our anniversary a couple of days ago. We weren't seeing each other formally (we're doing something this weekend) but as a surprise I left a silly little present (based on a private in-joke) on his kitchen table (I asked one of his other flatmates to let me in) while Tim was out studying. A few hours later he sent me a message asking if I'd left him the present. I said I had, and he said that Lisa had just knocked on his door holding it and saying that she'd just picked it up because she thought he'd like it. I said I'd left a note with it (nothing too fancy, just a little comment and my name) and a few minutes later he replied saying it had been torn up and tossed in the kitchen bin. I know it's something little, but it's just building up and up, and Lisa also tarnished what should have been a nice day. Tim brought it up with her but she vehemently denied it, and acted hurt that her 'insert generic relationship pet name term' would think the worst of her when it was obvious that I was lying to get between them.

&amp;#x200B;

We know we need to deal with this. Tim can't move out of his flat - his rent is covered by a scholarship that has strict conditions, including breaking the lease, and he could not afford to move without this financial help. He can't go to any kind of RA either, as Lisa is his accommodation's equivalent of that role. We both think that Lisa would be able to twist the situation if Tim took it to anyone above her, and it would reflect badly on him, with possibly dire consequences for his accommodation. What else can we do to deal with this situation?

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR - Boyfriend's university flatmate treats him like a pseudo boyfriend and gets annoyed when he does things with me, his actual girlfriend. My boyfriend has tried everything himself to stop her, and her position at the university means she can't be stopped bureaucratically, what else can be done to stop her actions?"
3,"My (18f) parents disowned me and kicked me out because I accidentally got pregnant


This entire situation blew up so fast in my face that I'm still reeling.

I should probably preface this by saying that my parents are extremely strict Asian immigrant parents. It's always been education and academics before love and support. I grew up being physically beat for getting a single ""B"" grade on my report card and having to give my mother my passwords to all of my accounts. Nevertheless, I obeyed their every command. I graduated just last week in the top 10% of my class and am going to Brown University on an almost full-ride (more on that later in regards to the current situation) this fall.

Following my college acceptances, I probably breathed the biggest sigh of relief in my entire life. My parents finally had nothing to complain about since I fulfilled their biggest dream for me: ""to get into an Ivy League school."" All was good for about a month. My parents finally stopped reading my text messages, tracking my every move, etc. I was free to go out with friends, spend time with my secret boyfriend, and just enjoy being a high schooler.

My boyfriend and I have been together since last summer, so almost a year now. My parents had their suspicions about us in the beginning but I brushed it off and faked my way into making them believe he was just a friend. But after I committed to Brown and they seemed happy enough, I became more lax about hanging out with him and I think they figured it out.

We started being sexually active in December but have always been incredibly careful about using protection. The only time where I'm not 100% sure we were careful was during spring break when we went to Mexico with a couple of our friends and got drunk and had sex. It would make a lot of sense if that's when it happened. Now, I fully understand that we were both stupid and should have exercised a lot more caution. It's our fault completely and I'm not saying otherwise.

Fast-forward to about a week ago. I'm starting to get weird period-like symptoms, but no period. At that point, I honestly just knew. It was like this weird gut feeling and I freaked the fuck out. My boyfriend was incredibly supportive and drove me over to his house where he'd already gotten tests and had me take two of the pretty expensive ones. All positive. I broke down and cried for hours.

When I got home, I was still visibly upset despite trying my best to hide it. But I wasn't acting carefully or thinking rationally because of everything that happened. I spoke to him explicitly about the situation over a messaging app that my mom has my password to. In retrospect, she definitely suspected that something happened between me and him (probably a break-up) so she logged on to read our messages.

The very next day, I wake up to the sound of my mom lugging all of my stuff out of my room and throwing it onto our lawn. I get up and ask what the fuck she's doing and she's crying and calling me the nastiest stuff in Chinese like, ""You're a whore, just kill yourself,"" or, ""I should have gave you up for adoption you useless piece of shit."" And other completely ridiculous things like, ""Now you're a prostitute and no longer a virgin, no good boy will ever want to marry you now.""

I was begging her to stop but the more I did the angrier she got. She was breaking the majority of my stuff, tearing up my work/papers, smashing my photographs, etc. All I could to was call my boyfriend and have him pick me up.

It's been three days since that happened. I've picked up all of my stuff, at least the stuff that isn't irreparably damaged. My mother or father is not returning any of my calls but continuously sends me brutal text messages about how much of a failure and disappointment I am and how I turned into a prostitute. She also communicated that she will no longer be paying for my education at Brown and that I will never be allowed to call her my mother and have any interaction with her. My yearly tuition not including personal expenses is around $15,000. I have about $10,000 in my own personal checking account from just working a few jobs throughout high school. However, that's not counting the birthday money I've received and the money that my grandfather left me when he passed. Those are in a separate account being controlled by my mother. There's about $75,000 in there and I have no idea how I'm going to get it back.

I'm currently living with my boyfriend. His parents are at a complete loss as to why my parents are behaving this way and I am so ashamed. They've been nothing but supportive of us, even going as far as to offer to pay for whatever choice I end up making about the baby. We've both decided that I'll get an abortion and he's currently working on figuring all of that out while I'm still worrying about my entire fucking future.

I don't know why but I just feel so incredibly alone at this moment despite having my boyfriend and his family. I can't my best friends because I don't want this to spread and I obviously have no familial support. I'm just so lost. What should I even do at this point?

TL;DR: Strict Asian parents disowned me and kicked me out of the house after snooping and finding out I was pregnant. They've cut off all contact and refuses to pay for my college tuition. I fully plan on attending Brown this fall after getting the abortion, but I have no money. I'm at a complete loss as to what to do. Any advice appreciated."
4,"UPDATE ‘My (28f) partner (28m) is convinced I am cheatinh


Original:
https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/bh5tlh/my_28f_partner_28m_is_convinced_i_am_cheating/

So it got a bit of attention so I wanted to do an update. Plus shit hit the fan over the last few days, so buckle yourselves in.

After we spoke about the original issue, things did get better. Then, little fragments of other controlling behaviour started to come out.
I thought we could work through them.

Until when things came to a head. I found out he had, in fact, cheated on me.
When I attempted to leave him over this, he became very, very abusive to the point where he was arrested. Three things, screamed, threatened me, trapped me in the house.

I’m crushed, but relieved I found out now. Staying with friends currently. Trying to process.

So, I guess, if there’s a moral to the story - don’t ignore signs of abuse?
But, I can’t help the sense that the escalation came out of nowhere, and how - before - if you’d tried to tell me this would have happened I would have laughed in your face. I guess I don’t know what I could have done to prevent this. 
The original issue seemed to be able to be worked through, but was masking... this.

Thank you to everyone who offered advice and support in my previous post.
Apart from that one guy who thought I’d had a Freudian slip in one of my comments and became convinced I had, actually, cheated on my partner. Like I was a Scooby Doo villain. In retrospect, you can go fuck yourself.

Tl;dr boyfriend thought I was cheating, he was cheating, became abusive, got arrested, I eacaped"
5,"How do I {15M} get my foster dad {36 M} to adopt me?


I've been with him since I was 12. He was married then. My foster mom was a bit of a wench but whatever. She screamed a lot at me and even him. They fought all the time. She moved out a year or so ago and things have been really great since. No more fights. No more yelling.

They fought a lot about wanting kids. He wanted to adopt a baby (she couldn't have kids or something, maybe didn't want them??? I don't know). I know she always said no to adopting a baby or fostering young kids. I've had a few foster brothers and sisters since being here all around my age. Right now it's just me.

I'm starting to feel panicky since my foster dad sat me down the other day and told me he's starting a surrogacy process. A friend of his sister is going to carry the baby. Apparently their getting the legal stuff sorted then will do IVF.

I just feel really bad since. Like uneasy. I'm worried that if that happens I'll have to go somewhere else. I get really upset just thinking about that. I don't want to leave. This has been the longest placement. Its the closest thing to home I've ever had

My foster dad is nice. I don't really see him as a dad. I see him as like a potential dad maybe. I don't know. It's hard to explain. He's like an uncle I guess? That sort of feeling. He's been good to me and has helped and taught me a lot.  I'm scared of never seeing him again or him forgetting about me or not wanting me anymore.

I want him to adopt me so he can't get rid of me. I want him to adopt me so we can be family. I don't want him to have a baby. I want him to want me instead.

How do I get him to adopt me? How do I convince him I'm better than a baby?


TLDR: I want my foster dad to keep me instead of having a baby. How do I get him to adopt me instead?"
6,"update: I [16M] got into an argument with my older brother [26M] and told him he'll never measure up to our deceased father


i though i would provide an update to my [first post](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/azopg2/i_16m_got_into_an_argument_with_my_older_brother/). 

someone advised me that i write my brother a letter apologizing, which i did. i apologized for being mean and hurtful, and that I was wrong for doing that. i also got him a separate card and wrote a message thanking him for everything he's done for me. I went to his house with my letter and card when I found out he was home to go talk to him, but unfortunately when I got there he was gone already, so I slid them under the door. 

When he got back home he found them and read them, and then he called me to arrange to come see me. He came over here and I apologized in person for what I said. He was very straightforward with me and honest about my actions. He explained that the reason he had been avoiding me lately is because he needed some time apart because he was beginning not to like me. He said loved me, but I he didn't want to be around me sometimes.

That was pretty hard to hear. He said that lately I've just been not very nice, the comment about our Dad was by far the worst, but I make other snappy comments. He had tried to brush it off as me being 'just as teenager', but had now decided it was best to let me know. ""Being a teenager is not an excuse to be a constant asshole to everybody at home"", is how he put it. He gave a few examples and looking back he was absolutely right. 

It was pretty upsetting to hear. I know he wasn't saying it to upset me, and I was thankful that he was telling me (or at least I'm thankful now). I promised that I would check my attitude, he said a little more thoughtfulness was all I needed, and that even though sometimes I act like an asshole he knows I'm not one. After we finished talking we hugged, he told me not to forget that he loves me and that I'm great. 

Since then I've been trying to be more considerate. I really am trying to follow the advice he gave me. It's been a couple months now, and I'm happy to say that it's working. Our mom told me a couple weeks ago that Im a joy to be around. In the car earlier today my brother told me that its been really nice spending time with me lately. so thats good news. 

TL;DR apologized to my brother for the terrible thing I said to him. he warned me that I was turning into someone that he didn't want to be around, even though he loved me. i've worked on fixing my attitude over the past two months, and today my brother told me its nice to hang out with me these days."
7,"I [38F] love my husband [39M, married 14 years] so much, but he is thoughtless and I am exhausted paying for his mistakes


I would have always said that my husband is a great, loving, kind, etc. etc. husband, all of the awesome things people say. But I think I am checking out. Part of me is desperate to save the marriage, part of me is exhausted from suffering the consequences of his thoughtlessness. (no kids, btw).

I think ""Walk Away Wife"" syndrome fits me pretty well.

In the beginning of our marriage, when he didn't lift a finger to do housework, and I tried every way imaginable to talk, nag, cry, encourage, etc., and nothing worked, I just sucked it up and did the chores.  He's better now than he was - but the bulk of housework, emotional labor, running the house, managing our pets' care, etc. still falls to me. 


We don't have much in common to talk about. I ask him about his interests, not because I care about those things, but because I care about HIM. He said ""I'm just not interested in the stuff you are."" He doesn't ask about my day, or what I did, or anything. It's not that he's malicious, it just never occurs to him to step outside of his own head.  


We moved a few years ago to the middle of nowhere and there are NO jobs here. He has a great job making more money than we both made combined, and it was agreed that I'd stay home and do writing work and maintain the house and property, and he would bring home the income. I have holes in my sneakers and my bras are 4 years old and have holes in them. Every time I have a household need or I need clothing, even a $15 bra, we have NO money. But he has a new truck, a new shed, a workshop full of new power tools and accessories, and he's been going out for steak dinners and drinks weekly. When I pointed this out, he was very remorseful and said he was cutting back his spending and was going to make sure I had what I needed. But I feel it may be too little, too late. I have been telling him for YEARS I need new clothes and shoes, and now that I am looking at divorce lawyers, suddenly he's scrambling. Where was this remorse 6 months ago? I could get a job, but I would have to move out in order to avoid a heinous commute (the very reason we moved out of the city!) And if I move out... well, I will do so as a single woman. My husband doesn't want this but I don't know what options I have. 
 

He has criticized and nitpicked things I love. I am at the point where I fear playing music by my favorite band, because every time he hears a single note, he starts in. ""UGH this shit again, when are these guys going to die already?"" This band is a part of who I am and it HURTS. If I eat something he doesn't like - ""Cilantro? Ugh all cilantro needs to be wiped off the face of the planet!"" It wasn't funny the first 10,000 times he said it in our first year of marriage. After 14 years, I am SO fucking OVER it. 

Of course he has said loving things too. He has been my biggest cheerleader and supporter. But mixed with all of the painful barbs and criticism (this is a tiny fraction) it feels like death by 1,000 paper cuts. 

The worst is the lack of trust. He makes poor decisions. Things like loading things in the back of his pickup truck, not securing them, and I say ""You have to tie them down. They'll fly out of the back."" He brushes me off like I'm crazy, so I let it go. Sure enough, shit flies out the back, and he gets fined, and that's money I could have used on shoes or a bra. The kicker - sometimes (very rarely) he does stuff like this AGAIN, and then LIES to me about it. I find out, he comes clean, cries, promises never to do it again - but the trust is still broken.

He made a huge purchase recently, and I asked if we could afford it. He said yes. I asked if he ran the numbers, and he said yes. I asked if he was 100% POSITIVE, and he said ""YES"". Yesterday, we sat down with our budget, and guess what? We cannot afford it. He never ""ran the numbers."" To be fair, he THOUGHT we could afford it. He ASSUMED it was okay. But he lied to me again and again when I asked if it was affordable and if he made sure. 
 

Over the years, I have tried to fix and fix. He refused therapy, so I went alone, to be a better person and a better wife. I took all the responsibility to work on our marriage while he sat back. Now he's suddenly agreed to couples counseling but I'm afraid it may be too late. I don't know if I can trust him anymore. 


I love this man. I love him so much. I am beyond shattered at the thought of leaving. It's unbearable. But if I had left 6 months ago, I would have been better off. And all I can think is ""How will his thoughtlessness hurt me 6 months from now?"" 

Can we save this? 


 TL;DR - I think I am a ""Walk Away Wife"". I love my husband, and I know he loves me, but his thoughtlessness has been hurting me over the years and I don't trust that he can change."
8,"My [27M] friend [27M] just broke up with his longtime gf [27?F] and I've got feelings for him


I'm not using a throwaway, because I fear no man.

Right, so I feel like a complete and utter teenager right now cos this seems like such a high school problem. There's a lot of moving parts in this, so let me explain why this is even a predicament in the first place.

I've been friends with this guy (I'll call him A) for over 10 years. We're really close, and about 5-6 years ago we kind of had a FWB situation, but it never really went anywhere further than that. I honestly don't know his sexuality, but he slept with me, and has been dating a girl (Let's call her B) for the past 5 years (who is also why we broke off our FWB thing), so I ASSUME he's somewhat bisexual. 

I was honestly fine with it through the whole relationship, and have dated other guys since, and I've always seen him as a really good friend. I was honestly shocked at how easy I found it to go from FWB to just friends, but it was pretty seamless, and most of our mutual friends don't even know that we were. A part of me has always thought we'd make a good couple, but it'd just been a passing thought, we're legit just close friends.

Anyway, two weeks ago A broke up with B, and I very suddenly got bombarded by a ton of feelings for him that I guess I've kind of held down for the past few years. I've been trying my best to give him space and JUST be a friend to him, because I don't want to be a rebound, or make him feel (or me) like I'm taking advantage.

Here's where it gets tricky. A friend (27F, I'll call her C) who I've known for YEARS, who I introduced to A, has also expressed romantic interest for him. I don't know if she knows about me and A's history, and PROBABLY not my feelings for him, so there's 0 chance she's being malicious or even knows I like him. 

Recently, A and C skipped out on a meetup with a group of our friends, just to hang out with eachother alone. I'm not sure if it was a date, or what, but knowing C's feelings, it's kind of making me feel pressured to say my piece to A about how I feel before they potentially get together. 

I don't think I'd mind if he picked her over me after he knows all the facts (It's not like I've not been turned down by straight guys before), but if I missed out my chance to tell him how I feel, I'd feel terrible, but his breakup is still fresh and I don't want to add more confusing feelings to it all, or make him feel like he can't come to me for support in case I have ""ulterior motives"". 

Maybe I could talk to C about it, too, but I don't want to turn it into a sort of ""back off I saw him first"" kind of deal. Hell, it's also possible that A has no interest in C and I'm worried about nothing.

TL;DR: Friend broke up with his GF. I want him. Another friend wants him too. The break up is still too fresh for me to feel comfortable telling him how I feel, but I don't want to miss my chance if things between those two moves quicker than I expect. What do?"
9,"My (30F) best friend (28F) is becoming obsessive about her Instagram


  

TLDR: My best friend has an unhealthy obsession with her Instagram profile and it's driving me nuts. 

  

My best friend of 5+ years has recently become OBSESSIVE about her Instagram. Yesterday we hung out for several hours and it seemed to be almost exclusively what she talked about. She said that her ""grid"" is ""so important"" and has to ""have the right aesthetic at all times."" For that reason she is ONLY wearing ""white, blue, or coral"" so that her grid is ""color-coordinated."" I snapped a quick picture of her and she said she had to wait until the next day to post it because, ""My maximum engagement on posts is at 11 am and I already posted one today - I can never double post.""

&amp;#x200B;

It's frustrating to see her so obsessed with social media. She recently went on a trip to the beach and told me she spent ""several hours"" and ""a few hundred pictures"" getting just the perfect shot to post. She was planning a trip overseas and bought a $285 jacket because ""it'll look so good in pictures.""

&amp;#x200B;

Yesterday she harassed me about how I ""never like her pictures anymore"" and she was musing that maybe I don't value her friendship because I haven't consistently been liking her pictures. I expressed concern and she said, ""It's just something fun and creative for me! You get to have something fun and creative right now so you should respect mine!"" (I'm planning my wedding.)

&amp;#x200B;

I love her so much and I want her to be happy. I just worry that this obsession with her social media is not healthy. She is not ""an influencer"" or anything so it's not like this is part of her job. How can I either express my concern OR find ways to shut down the conversation when she is going on and on about it?"
10,"I (23F) feel incapable of loving my grandfather (66M) due to how he treated my father (49M) as a child.


Although he’s a good person now, my grandfather used to be a terror. Specifically, to my father. He stepped in when my father was 5 (he’s actually my step-grandfather) and seemed to make it his life goal to make his life hell. I don’t even want to go into detail about the abuse he gave him for little to no reason. 

He has since deeply apologized to my father and reformed himself (this happened before I was born). My dad forgave him and they have a pretty decent relationship now. He’s always been a good grandfather to me. Still, I don’t believe I can ever see him in a good light. I don’t even want to call him my grandfather (technically, he isn’t anyway). And I can honestly say without a doubt that I won’t shed a single tear when he passes. Hell, I’ve been looking forward to getting to wear this new black dress and if it’s at his funeral, that’ll be just fine. 

Nobody knows how I feel (or don’t feel) about him. When he visits or I see him I try my best to act like a loving granddaughter. It’s just so difficult to love someone who treated who I consider the best human being in the world like garbage. My dad forgave him so I don’t know why I can’t as well. I just genuinely don’t know how. 

**tl;dr** although they have a decent relationship now and he’s a good grandfather to me, I don’t know how to or forgive my grandfather for how he treated my dad growing up."
11,"When my (18F) cousin (9M) lost his leg. My (37F) mom nuked her relationship with my aunt (33F) and I want to reach out to my aunt but I don't know how.


In October of 2018, my cousin his right leg in an accident. There was nothing the doctors could have done to have saved the leg. It was a mess. They had to amputate it and it crushed my little cousin. The word upset doesn't fit him justice with how upset he was. He yelled at my grandfather and threw the juice at him when he made a joke trying to lighten the mood.

My aunt is a child psychologist. My aunt and my cousin had a long conversation about it. He came out a lot less angry than when he went in. He was still angry, but not lashing out at people. She was showing him a lot of love. She always has, but she  bought him an Nintendo Switch. She doesn't normally spoil him, but there was a bit if guilt she couldn't do anything. 

My mom completely nuked her relationship with my aunt. My mom has always had this tendency where she needs to be the centre of attention. She confront my aunt on not caring that my mom got engaged at around the same time. Maybe a day or two prior to my cousin losing his leg. That somehow turned into her saying my aunt has always been the pretty one of the family. My mom has some issues with men finding my aunt more attractive or something. It was a weird argument, but it completely nuked the relationship. 

I want to reach out to my aunt, but I'm not sure how or what to say.

12,"I’m [25/f] a stay-at-home mum of two [1/m + 5/f]. My husband [25/m] works but won’t help at home


Hello everyone, first of all thank you for clicking on my post :) 

Me and my husband have been together for 7 years and married for 4. For most of those years my husband has been the sole provider for our family and I will always be thankful for that. I tell him most days how much I appreciate him working for us. 

The reason I’m posting on here today is because I need advice. My husband thinks that because he goes to work that I am then in charge of the house and the children 24/7. When we first met I was terrible with cooking and cleaning, I was a young student. But over the years his expectations of me got higher and higher to the point where my daily routine is as follows: 

I wake up at 6.30am and get dressed, my husband goes to work. I get the children up, make them breakfast and dress them, I take my eldest to school. Once I get back home my housework is as follows; put on a laundry wash, tidy up every room in the house and remove any rubbish, clean every surface in every room, make all the beds, clean and bleach the bathroom, mop and hoover all floors in the house, do all the washing up and put it away, hang the laundry out to dry, take the bin outside, put all the recycling outside. I then have to pick up my eldest from school and I finish off the house by hoovering the hallway after we’ve come home so it looks fresh and I basically make sure the house is perfect. I then make dinner so when my husband comes home at 5 he can sit down and eat. I have to do all of this whilst juggling and entertaining a 1 year old.

Once my husband has eaten his dinner he’ll get up from the table and either get a shower or go and watch tv. Me and the children will still be eating so we’ll finish up and then once we’re done it’s my job to clean up. I wash up all the pots and pans and plates from dinner and then I clean the kitchen for the second time that day. I will also sweep up any crumbs that have dropped from dinner and mop again. It is then my job once that’s done to then take the children to bed. They will go and say goodnight to their dad and then I’ll brush their teeth, get them dressed for bed. I’ll then read them a bedtime story and I’ll quickly tidy up any toys. Once all that’s done I can finally get my pyjamas on. Sometimes I want to get a bath or knit but my husband will have a go and say he wants to watch tv with me and that I’ve had all day to have a bath or knit (when in reality I rarely have time to even shower)

The truth is, I’m exhausted. The reason I clean the house so thoroughly every single day is because my husband tells me I have to. That it is my job, and as I can’t financially help that I can help that way instead. But it’s gotten so bad to the point where he says ornaments have to be facing a certain way, blinds have to be drawn to a certain height, the bed has to be made a certain way. It’s so hard to keep up with the work with two children. And when I finally do it all I’m nervous that I’ve forgotten something.

I’m sick of working hard all day for him to come home and not help one single bit. Even on weekends when he isn’t at work he expects me to clean the house just as I do during the week and look after the children as well as cook meals and act like his servant. He says “it’s my day off and I work hard to have it” when I ask for help. But I don’t get a day off EVER.

What do I do? I don’t want a life like this

Could someone please advise me on things I could say to him that might open his eyes and make him realise what’s happening? 

TLDR: My husband works during the week and uses that as an excuse not to help with the children or house work. I’m exhausted of doing everything on my own and I don’t know what to do"
13,"Bf (21M) told me (22F) yesterday that I should go out, which was followed by ""so that I can feel like i'm dating someone who actually has a life"".


My boyfriend's favourite phrase when we have an argument is to say ""if you actually had a life this wouldn't bother you"". It's not like i'm socially inept and have no friends, I have friends but recently due to masses of university work I haven't had much time to catch up with them (only in the last few weeks). However, this phrase, even when he knows I've gone out to see friends recently, is not always specifically referring to how I don't go out often; sometimes it's about him seeming unhappy that I'm not cool enough, not inspirational etc. For example, one time I asked him if he knew about the Mardi Gras festival coming up and he tried to tell me I know nothing about it and quoted it to be a ""pride festival""; then I said that I don't know if it is that and so he told me i was uncultured. Another thing he said to me (after him telling me he wants to go travelling, so i said could I come with) was ""you know nothing about travelling, so why would you even want to come with?"" He also tells me often that I don't have good social skills (despite me knowing that I do).   


I cook homemade meals every day, I go to the gym, I do yoga classes, I like good films and not only that but I'm studying to be a biologist and statistician. Despite me being confident that I'm not this loser he makes me out to be, it makes me feel run-down knowing that my partner views me like that. Does anyone know how to stop his words from stinging me so hard? Is he even in the right to be saying such words? I used to be able to ignore his comments, but he says that I have no life so often that it's really starting to get to me now and I can feel myself crumble in absolute self insecurity here; I am getting increasingly anxious at night because that's when we spend time together.  


TL;DR: My boyfriend views me as a bit of a loser, he says rude things to me about who I am as a person and doesn't see me in a positive light. It's really starting to get to me. Is he even in the right to say such things about me?"
14,"My (f 23) dad (m 51) moved his girlfriend (f 25) into the house. I've become good friends with her, and he's pissed off that we hang out



So my dad, my grandma, and me, live together. My mom and dad divorced a couple years ago, and now I'm living with my dad so I can pay off my student loans faster, and also help care for my grandma who's sick.

I don't have a great relationship with my dad for a number of reasons. But we coexist ok living together. He gets help caring for my grandma, and I get to live rent free. But honestly a lot of the time we act like roommates who tolerate each other rather than family

My dad hasn't had the best dating record, he tends to go for people who don't really have theire shit together, who seem fun and exciting on the surface but have issues. So I didn't think too much of it when he said he was dating someone new, 6 months ago. Heard that stuff before. I told him that his dating life was his business and I didn't wanna hear any of it.

Anyway two months ago he told me that his girlfriend was moving in with us. I didn't love the idea but honestly I'm getting to live in his house rent free so I figured i couldn't complain. 

So Penny moved in, and I knew she was younger but I didn't know she was my age!! That was very weird for me at first but whatever. 

I kept to myself for a while, just going to work, and going out with friends or to the gym after work so I wasn't home much. But then one day Penny's car broke down and I offered to take a look at it because I'm pretty good with cars. And she and I chatted through the whole time , and I started to realize she was a pretty amazing person. She's very kind, been through some tough stuff in her life, but she's patient and perseverant, and really strong. We kept talking after that day, talking about anything and everything. Except her relationship with my dad, since I said that it was weird to hear about that stuff since he's my dad. And she respected that totally.

We started hanging out more, I brought her out to concerts and nights out with my friend's, and started going to the gym together too.

I get the impression that my dad is angry about us hanging out. Jealous perhaps of the time spent together? I don't know. But he's making more and more snippy comments about us being "" best gal pals"" and I can hear him and Penny arguing about how I am turning her into a ""party animal"" and that's not who she is??? 

He hasn't said anything direct to me, and I think Penny is avoiding the topic because of the time I told her that I don't wanna know about what she and my dad are up to. But I do wanna clear the air and I wanna know how I should go about it. 

I think my dad is being immature to be seeing someone much younger and not liking it when she does fun stuff with me and my friend's.

TL;DR my dad is seeing Penny. I've become friends with Penny. My dad's not a fan of that which is weird, and I wanna say something to clear the air"
15,"Mom (58F) having surgery wants me to visit her for a month, but spending time with parents makes me (26F) mentally unstable. What do I do?


MOM’S SITUATION: My mother is having a bad time, health-wise. She’s getting laser eye surgery next week for glaucoma and is likely getting a partial mastectomy at the end of the year. 

MOM’S REQUEST: Now that my mother is having a hard time, she is imploring me to visit for a month this summer. She lives in a very far away country (opposite side of the world) and it wouldn’t really be worth just taking two weeks to visit because of the time it takes to travel (would add up to three-four days including rest/jet lag after plane ride). 

BACKGROUND: My parents and I have a so-so relationship. We love each other very much but they were unintentionally very damaging emotionally as I was growing up, and continue to do so today. For example, my mother cannot help but bring up my weight multiple times a day and when I tell her to stop she says she just cares about me and denies that she keeps bringing it up. My father prioritizes her mental health over mine - I think because she screams and cries he thinks she is more fragile than me. He once dismissed me saying that her behavior has made me suicidal. I think he thought I was being dramatic.

On the whole, they have been generous to me and support me through difficult times. For example, financially supporting me through a year and a half of being unemployed.

PROBLEM: I know I should be there for her. I’m an only child and so much of her life is focused on my well being. But her expression of it is so unhealthy - despite me calling it out as factually as I can - that being around her for more than a week completely throws me off.

She visited for two weeks this month, and as soon as she left I experienced the worst anxiety I’ve had for years. Shaking, unable to stand up because of tightening muscles, heart palpitations for days - I went to the hospital for heart attack symptoms and had to ask my psychiatrist for anti-anxiety meds. I used to abuse them (different brand) and was committed to never touching them again, but I was in such physical and mental distress. 

—-

TL;DR What do I do? She is having a physical/mental health crisis this year. I would visit her in a heartbeat if it wasn’t for the fact that extended time with her can bring me to such anxiety I feel pain and suicidal ideation. Would not going make me even more guilty and self-loathing? Is it worth crushing her own hopes and wish for this expression of love?

I work remotely so there is no “can’t travel” excuse. Help."
16,"My (32 F) estranged brother (35 M) responded to a text for the first time in 4 years. It's the only chance I've gotten to reconnect. What do I do??


(Please be gentle, I'm genuinely panicking over what feels like my only chance to have any sort of relationship with my sibling.)

&amp;#x200B;

For background: My brother cut me and our mother out of his life four years ago. He got married and his wife didn't like the two of us very much, and since his relationship with our mother had already been strained, her dislike was something of a last straw for him. He and I were very close growing up, but since his wife wasn't ok with him talking to either of us, and because I was supporting our mother financially, he cut me out alongside her. 

&amp;#x200B;

Before he cut us out entirely, I'd demanded to know why I was being cut out when his issues were with our mother, not me, but he never had a response for me. It always came back to ""Well Mom did \[x\]."" ""But I'm not Mom."" ""Yeah, but Mom did \[x\]."" My association with her was enough for him, but I wasn't going to turn my back on her to keep him, especially after we lost our dad and when his wife already had a huge hate-on for me.

&amp;#x200B;

When I realized I'd lost him (he'd been responding less and less, and finally delivered a long text stating his grievances and that he wanted nothing to do with us anymore), I said some things I regret. I've always been the peacekeeper of the family, but I was extremely hurt, wanted to hurt him back, and felt at the time that I had nothing to lose. He gave me a brief response and has since refused to acknowledge my existence. The first year of our estrangement, I occasionally reached out a few times, small texts about something I was watching or the simple statement ""I miss you"". He never responded, and I didn't want him to block my number, so I stopped reaching out. I never apologized for the things I said in anger.

&amp;#x200B;

Since then, I've been pretending he didn't exist, as much as that's possible when you've lost someone who partially defines who you are as a person. It hurts, but I've been getting by. A few days ago, I was at a party and someone sent me a picture of what I would look like if I were a man, and it was the spitting image of my brother. So, expecting him to ignore me as he's done for the last several years, I sent the image to him with the caption that it made me laugh and that I hoped he was doing well.

&amp;#x200B;

He actually responded, with a short but positive message. And I'm now sinking into a panic spiral. Do I take the opportunity to apologize for the things I said? Do I pretend nothing happened and try to continue a normal conversation? I ask this knowing full well that his response was likely not an invitation to continue talking, and that anything I send to him will probably get no response, but this is the first ray of hope I've had in years with a sibling I was  once very close with. Has anyone else had a surprise, temporary reconnection to an estranged family member whom they actually wanted in their lives? What do I do? How do I not make matters worse? For all my hurt feelings, I know that none of that matters if I want him back--he's perfectly comfortable keeping me out of his life, and I still stand a good chance of never seeing him again.

&amp;#x200B;

tl;dr: My brother stopped speaking to me years ago and I stopped reaching out in turn. He shocked me by actually responding to a text I sent him. What do I do to at least try to make this a genuine chance to reconnect?"
17,"How do I (24M) approach Girlfriend (23F) of 3 years about her needing too much support?


 

Hi all,

I'm in a relationship with a person who needs a lot of support. These are the forms of support I give to her:

* Financial - I run broke every week trying to buy food for her because she has no money after rent
* Travel - She has no license, I take her to and from work, and to and from the several volunteering things that she is a part of. This adds up to a tremendous amount of driving roughly 3/4 days a week that usually messes with my mornings before work and uni. She has been talking about getting her license for years.
* Emotional - She hasn't gone to see a doctor about her mental health after years of talking about it, but she has anxiety to the point where she will ring me at any given time at least once a week having a panic attack. Sometimes she will spend days in bed not eating. Today I was trying to finish an assignment but she rang me panicking and as a result I couldn't focus on my work.

This relationship feels like a daily struggle just to maintain my own life. My grades have dropped severely and I feel constantly miserable and anxious.

I struggle to bring any of this up with her because the minute I mention any problems at all, she will melt down and be depressed for days or she will have a panic attack.

My family also dislikes her because they can see that this is obviously way too much for any person to do for someone else.

Sometimes I think of leaving, but immediately decide not to, because without me she might lose her job and spiral even further down into a greater mess.

What can I do about this? What would your advice be?

Thank you for your time.  


**TL;DR** Girlfriend is not taking responsibility for herself, forcing me to support her in multiple ways, and I don't know how to bring it up with her or whether I should just leave or not"
18,"My [25F] sister [25F] is teaching the kid of a NFL player. My boyfriend [26M] is being creepy and borderline begging her to befriend the father.


My sister is a teacher at a private school. She's teaching the song of an NFL player. I'm not going to say who it is. She's met this guy a parent/teacher nights and spoken to him briefly. I don't want to put too much detail, and I'm being careful of what I say for obvious reasons of anonymity. so this will be short. 

My boyfriend is in love with the team this guy plays for. He's been begging my sister to become friends with the father to get to talk to him. He keeps bringing it up about how we have in to talk to NFL players. How do I get him to stop bringing this up every second day?

TL;DR: Boyfriend thinks that because my sister teaches the son of a NFL player, he has an in to be friends with said NFL player."
19,"I (28f) got some screenshots through text of my husband (27m) talking incredibly bad about me, and lying about me cheating. Just celebrated our 10 years together... He denied everything, but now I've been send a video of him talking.


There are no words to describe this awful feeling. Absolutely horrified and shocked is an understatement.


Me and my husband met in high school, and I ended up pregnant at 19, so we went ahead and got married. I already knew he was who I wanted for the rest of my life, and he said the same. Getting married young was probably a mistake, but it happened and we both felt it was the right decision.


Just last month we celebrated 10 years together. I had no idea it was possible to love someone as much as I love him. Our life has always seemed amazing and exactly how I imagined.


We both work. He gets off at 3, gets our daughter from school. I get home at 7, go home and clean and cook, and just take care of the two most important people in my life. I'd never change a thing about my life.



On may 5th, I got texts from a number I didn't know. She addressed me by my name and said she was about to send some screenshots. She told me it's important, but up to me whether I decided to look or not. I was beyond confused and honestly thought it was a joke at first. I kept asking her who she was and she'd say it doesn't matter and ""I honestly thought you were his horrible cheating ex wife"". 


There were a lot of screenshots, and some were text messages with his phone number before he changed it in January, and others were on Instagram and it was 100% his username.


It was honestly absolutely painful to read these. Some were


""I find her disgusting after whay she did to me. I can't even look at her. I'm not into sloppy seconds, gross""




""She knows I'm only with her because I HAVE to be""


""We are more business partners than anything. All I talk to her about is (daughters name) and money she owes me for bills""


""Yuck I can't even imagine touching her again after she f***ed some old man lmao""


""she knows things will never be the way they were before.""

""no she knows she broke my heart and I'm only with her because we HAVE to be"" e


""she can be a real pain in the *** to deal with. She's lucky I don't hit girls lol""


""you don't ever have to worry about me and her babe like seriously I'm grossed out by her cus of all her hoing around""



As soon as I told him, he denied it all and said why would I believe ""s*** some random person"" would try and tell me... Someone is out to ruin our marriage, etc. And he said the directs messages could easily be faked. 

He said if he didn't wanna be with me, he'd tell me and be honest. 


Honestly, it was hard but I decided to just give him the benefit of the doubt. He's right, things can be easily faked and he even showed me apps that fake messages. And... I was extremely hopeful that the guy I've been with for so long woukdnt hurt me like that.  When you're married I feel like you're less likely to just believe these things, especially when you've known someone so long. 


So I texted her and asked where she got the ss, where did she get my number, he's saying it's fake, etc... Praying to God it wasn't real. There had to be an explanation. My husband wasn't this guy..... She never replied so I trusted him, and let it go. I even apologized to him for even thinking it was a possibility that it was true. 


But then... On Sunday night I got another text and she said ""I'm just going to send a video. I don't want to hurt you, but just so you know, that's how your husband talks about you. Could I fake this video? No."" 

In the video he was in the car, and he said ""yeah I don't know how I worded it exactly, but she basically knew I would be home talking to you and she flipped out on me. But idc, like.. B**** you cheated on me. But whatever, f*** that b****.""


10. Years. Together. And this is what he's doing behind my back? He's trashing me and convincing some side chick that I'm a cheater and he hates me and I gross him out?


While I work my butt off all day long, come home and clean for him, cook for him, take care of him etc...... He's talking about me to someone and lying and playing a victim.


So... Yes I know.... Need to leave. But 10 years with this man, and all the sudden it might be over, just like that? I don't even know what to do right now. Honestly. No idea.


Everyday I saw him before I knew all this, he was the same. So sweet, caring, loving. Treats me like a queen. By his actions I'd never suspect ANYTHING. He's absolutely amazing to me and makes me feel so insanely loved.... And now I'm lost and confused.


I don't even know. 10 years with this guy being so amazing to me.... I can't even see how this is the same man. I don't know if there's any truth to his words to that girl.... I never cheated, but what if I do disgust him somehow but that's an excuse as to why?


I'm so confused and I apologize for anything that doesn't make sense. I'm gonna try and sleep. I just could use advice. Is there any hope for this, or should I let go? :(


Tl;dr; received screenshots of my husband talking to a girl saying I cheated, I'm disgusting, he's only with me because he has to be etc. He convinced me they were fake and someone is out to ruin our marriage... But then I got a video of him talking about me. And now I feel absolutely crushed."
20,"My (23f) boyfriend (26m) is driving across the country for a friend (26f) who he is attracted to


Throwaway account because my bf knows my main one. 


So long story short, my boyfriend of 6 months (we will call him David) has a friend (lets call her Daphne) from university who now lives on a different continent. He has mentioned her before in passing, and told me how much he wants to go visit her (with me as well). Well Daphne is coming back this weekend for her best friends wedding; and David has offered to pick her up at the airport (very very early in the morning), and then drive her to her friends wedding (4 hours drive) attend the wedding as her plus one, and then drive her back to the airport the next morning (4 hours again). When he told me this was his plan, I told him he was a really good friend for doing that, to which he responded 'are you jealous'? I said no, I wasn't, to which he said 'well you should be, she's really hot'. 


He then pulled up her instagram account, and showed me pictures of her. I was visibly unenthused about this, and agreed she was pretty and then rolled my eyes. He then told me 'not to be silly' and started tickling me, and we moved on. 


The next day he tells me how Daphne really wants me to like her, and that she wants me to follow her on instagram (her account is private) so that I can watch her story whilst her and David go on their road trip to the wedding. I really didn't want to do this, because frankly I'm working all weekend and don't want to watch a very pretty girl and my bf on a fun trip together. Like I'd rather just ignore it. But after the second time he asked me to, I said 'oh yeah the girl you are super attracted to?' to which he responded with the ""shrug emoji"". I then told him to fuck off, and he told me 'aww dont be silly, I only have eyes for you'. I then said okay fine, and followed her account as he seemed really keen and I didn't want to show that I was jealous/annoyed any further. Basically I didn't want to have an argument. 


So they've been driving all morning today, he's sent me a few texts when they've taken breaks, and our conversation is normal. He keeps telling me to watch her instagram story, so I have which has been very annoying. Daphne is clearly very appreciative of David for doing this massive favour, and is posting things like 'my knight in shining armour' as well as videos of them singing and laughing and basically having a super fun time. 


I feel super super jealous, and I am in a foul mood (at work as well). I told David that work was busy and that I couldn't text much because basically I didn't want to talk to him anymore and have to pretend that everything is cool and that I'm excited for him. He keeps sending me updates about the drive and how close they are etc. 


Am I overreacting to this situation? I am questioning my feelings because David is such a lovely guy 99% of the time, and makes me feel so happy and appreciated. Should I just grin and bear the rest of the weekend or bring it up again? I want to ask him if he has romantic feelings for her, but I know he will just say no...It really seems like he does. 


Thanks for reading :) any advice is appreciated. 


TLDR; boyfriend (of 6 months) patently told me how attractive he finds his female friend, and is now driving across the country as a favour for her, and expects me to be excited about it. Am I overreacting? Does he have feelings for her?"
21,"I (28/F) love my job. My fiancé (30/M) is ashamed of it. Do I have to choose between them?


Fiancé (30/M) and I (28/F) have been together for 2 years, the wedding is in 5 months. 

My entire life I’ve wanted to be a performer. I worked my ass off and somehow actually managed to make a career out of performing. I feel very proud of myself because I’ve had really incredible life experiences due to my profession (I even lived in another country for over a year working as a singer). I used to think this huge part of who I am was interesting and exciting. It gave me confidence.

My fiancé is a software engineer. I know, complete other end of the spectrum as well as being a much higher-paying job than my current-but-steady gig. Over the span of our relationship I’ve noticed an increasing lack of support for my job. Little comments here and there about the impracticality of remaining a performer in the future, never wanting to see my performances, awkwardly ignoring me if I sing around the house or in the car (like he’s waiting for me to just shut up). My entire life I’ve loved singing and have been praised for my ability but now I’m finding myself embarrassed when I absentmindedly sing along to a favorite song within earshot of my fiancé. I cringe at my own pride or for feeling “cool” for being a performer. 

I’m beginning to realize that my future spouse will never be proud of me the way I used to be proud of myself. My confidence is waning, I feel embarrassed when I tell people what I do (especially his family who also seem to believe it’s not a respectable job). Performing has been such a major part of my life and I have put so much energy into actually making a career out of it that it feels like a piece of me. Him not being supportive of that part of me makes me worry that he doesn’t really love “the whole package” and is hoping for an a la carte version of me where he can pick and choose his favorite parts and cut the other parts out. I feel like I’m losing myself because I love him so much that i want him to be proud of me and I’m tormented by the feeling that I’m letting him down and that I should change professions.

When I talk to him he says he just doesn’t find it interesting and loves me for other reasons and just can’t see himself ever caring about my job or this part of me that is “performer.” Am I going to have to live in a constant state of embarrassment over my chosen profession? He’s turning something I loved more than anything in the world (up until I met him) into something I’m ashamed of. I’m becoming a different person and it’s making me really anxious and depressed.

I’m looking for advice on how to make these two things work in my life. I can’t imagine giving up my fiancé nor my job. How do I talk to him so he understands what I need? How can he give me what I need? If I continue down this path I’m going to lose him, my job, and myself.

TL;DR: I’m a performer, he’s a software engineer who makes more money than me. He’s ashamed of my profession and it’s destroyed my confidence and I’m losing who I am."

When I was 16, I started developing very intense feelings for my youth pastor, who was 24 at the time. 
I had (obviously) never been in a relationship or a serious relationship before, and the connection we had was incredibly passionate and intense. We spent a lot of time together, and a few months before he moved back to CO, I admitted my feelings to him. 

He told me he had tried to resist it, but couldn’t anymore. And so we started a secret, romantic relationship. 
I’ve struggled over the years on whether to tell anyone, but never have (except my boyfriend). 
But, I recently saw a photo of him and a girl in band, that her mom put on Facebook. “What a great teacher we have!”
I’ve been freaked out for a few weeks - what if he is an actual creep, and what if my silence has allowed him to manipulate more girls? 

Further background: 
This relationship was the caliber of an adult relationship, between two people ready to commit to marriage. 
The gravity of conversation was heavy. 
He would say things like, “I’ve never felt this way about any girl I’ve ever been with. You’re my one. We click perfectly.” 
Or he’d tell stories about how when he was a kid and his parents would take him to the symphony, he’d always say how we was going to marry a harpist. 
I was and still am a harpist. 
We connected on ALL the levels, and shared similar interests, ideals, wants, passions, etc. 
We could talk for hours and hours with no interruption in the conversation. 
He told me about where he wanted to marry me - at this chapel in Aspen. He even sent me pictures of it, “I can’t wait to see you in your wedding dress here.” 
We talked about children, etc. 

I trusted him. I trusted him to protect me, guide me and care for me. I believed him so deeply, especially because he was my youth pastor and an adult. 
His youth pastor actually married a girl in his class who was exactly 8 years younger, just like us. These kinds of things gave me hope that we’d be together. 

But, 16 year olds don’t know things 24 year olds do. 
Over time, sex became part of the conversation. A LOT. 
He was smart enough not to allow physical intimacy (anything sexual or sex at all. We were hold hands and hug only. Not even kissing on the lips) between us before he moved, because he knew he could be breaking the law and endangering his career. 
But he would call me to talk about our sexual fantasies. He would ask me what I wanted our first time to be like, and tell me to describe it to him. He’d walk me through step by step, “Okay, what do you want me to do to you next?” 
“Do you want to feel my dick inside you yet.” 
He said he no longer needed porn, because he had me to think about now. 
I was “so hot, incredible ass, gorgeous boobs, stunning face.” He would tell me exactly what he wanted to do to me. 
He would describe it in detail, too. He’d say how he was going to penetrate me for the first time, caress me, kiss my breasts, do oral on me, make me orgasm. 
There were even a few times he’d ask me to be on the phone with him while he masturbated. 
I agreed. 
His previous convictions about waiting until marriage dissolved away when it came to us. He told me it was okay to have sex before marriage - we loved each other. 
So, I planned to take a train to “go on a college visit”, to Colorado. We talked about how we couldn’t wait to kiss each other, and have sex. I was fully and totally committed to him, and would’ve literally done anything he told me - including sex. 
In my 16 year old mind, this was it. This was my person, my future, my world. 
This man was going to be my husband. 
He was attractive, older, smart, a man of faith. 
I honestly felt like a fucking cool ass college girl. 

I was going to move to Colorado after graduation, go to school there and move in with him. 
I had already started withdrawing from my own life. 
I went from a straight A student, varsity lettering softball player - to falling asleep in class and getting benched for the first time in my ENTIRE life. My mind was another place. My friends asked questions and I never told. I cared about him and had to protect him. 
My parents wondered what the hell was going on. I just said I was tired of having the pressure to achieve. 
I ditched jazz choir practice. 
My entire being was obsessed with him, staying up late to talk to him and getting to him as soon as I could. High school juniors usually don’t have a grown adult on the line waiting for them to give up their childhood and start adult life with them. But that was me. And I truly believed he loved me. 

Then one day he didn’t call. I thought he was probably busy and didn’t think much of it. 
Then 2 days passed, I called and no answer. I was freaking out. Did something happen? Is he okay? 
It’s not like I could call his brother or his parents. 
The kind of panic and worry I felt for a week - in isolation/alone with no one to talk to - was awful. 

Finally he calls me a week later. I was so relieved. He said he thought he told me him and his family were going up to the mountains for a fishing trip, and didn’t have reception. He never told me that. 
He said he left a voicemail. He never did. 
I told him how worked up I was, and how concerned I was. I couldn’t wait to see him, and it was hard to keep this all a secret. He said it was all going to be okay, and we’d be together soon. He’d call me the next day, no problem. He loved me. 

Now as an adult, I thank God we never got to be together soon. 
He completely ghosted me after that. No responses on texts or Facebook. Wouldn’t answer or return my calls. I knew he was fine because he’d update his status or check in at his church. 
I was obviously so confused and devastatingly heartbroken. 
He couldn’t even give me an explanation? How could he betray me like this? I gave up so much for him. And I would’ve given up everything, including my whole self to him. 
He literally just stopped communication. One day it was fine, the next it was over. I had no idea what was going on. 
That was the first time I felt heartbreak, and I did it alone. 
I beat myself up. Maybe if I was prettier, smarter, etc etc he’d want me. I could be like older girls, I’m mature for my age. 
Why didn’t he want me? I, to this day have never  felt rejection like that again. I spent so much time trying to find out what I did wrong to fuck it up. 

1.5 months later, he messages me. 
He said he was sorry, but ignoring me was the only way he could let me go. 
He said he could see how the relationship was too much for me, and was negatively affecting my life. He couldn’t let me give up my friends, family and activities to continue to maintain secrecy. He wanted me to experience guys my age, and do age appropriate things. He didn’t want to rob me of my senior year. 
Maybe in two years, he said. He would always care about me deeply, but we needed to stop our relationship. If it was further down the road, he said he’d propose to me immediately. 
He said he knew it would end badly from the beginning, but his feelings were to strong to deny. 
I asked if he would call to talk it over on the phone. He said he would. He never did. 

A month later, he’s dating someone new. They get engaged 5 months later. She calls off the wedding. He’s been single ever since. I often wonder if she called it off because she found the incredibly R rated texts he had once been sending to his 16 year old youth kid. 

For a lot of years I thought this was fine. It was a relationship that developed at the wrong time.
I honestly saw it as a break up/heart break just like my friends had gone through with their high school boyfriends. 
But I found out later, he had tried to make advances at two other girls in my youth group at the time he was there. Apparently, it was “minor” and just flirting level type stuff. They never were sucked into him like I was. 
Now as an adult, I realize how much he took advantage of the power he had over me. He manipulated me to believe everything was fine. Lying was okay, dating someone 8 years older at 16 wasn’t weird, and having sex with him was great, too. 
I’m so glad I never got on that train, because I know if I would’ve I without a doubt would’ve had sex with him. 
It makes me sad because I did think what we had was special. Then I found out it seems he was just looking for the right teenager to lock down. 
I kept my mouth shut about this to everyone, except for my current boyfriend. 
I was ashamed and embarrassed over time, but at first cared so much for him I did it to protect him. 

My youth pastor is a band teacher at a high school, and still works with youth in the church today. 

Should I have told someone? 
We never had sex, but we did have an intense romantic relationship. The only thing keeping us from fucking was a 7 hour car ride. 
I still today, am so blurred on this -  I can’t decide 100% if it was a just a creep saying anything to get into a teenagers pants, or if it was something real that he realized as an adult, could not healthily continue. 

I’ve typed out so many messages to him, telling him how much of a fuck he is for doing that to me. 
I’ve never sent one. 
I just have to hope he hasn’t done this to anyone else. 
I’ve gone back and forth for years whether to tell my church, or someone else who could counsel me on how to address it. I know it’s probably too late. 
I don’t know if it was genuine or wrong, and if it was wrong I don’t want my silence to hurt other vulnerable and trusting young girls. 

TL;DR: I dated my youth pastor when he was 24 and I was 16. We never had sex, but it was sexual and intense. He ghosted me eventually and I never told anyone. I found out later he’d made “flirting” advances at other girls at my church. 
He now is a high school band teacher and still works with youth church kids. 
I recently saw a photo of him and a girl in band, that her mom put on Facebook. “What a great teacher we have!”
My mind can’t stop thinking - what if he is a creep, and that girl is in danger because I kept my mouth shut all these years. 
I’m not sure if there’s anything I could still do."
23,"My [M34] oldest friend [M34] is snappy over my girlfriend [29F] and I want to end our friendship.


I really need help here reddit. A little about my friendship with Dave- he’s been my mate for 15 years, we’ve been through some shit together, and he’s always been my most solid friend. He’s always been prone to get jealous around me with girls and whichever women are in our lives, either separately or together, he will get very weirdly competitive. However, for various reasons both of us have been single pringles for longer than we’ve been in relationships, but he’s honestly like a brother to me. He’s been a shoulder to cry on when my mum passed away, I helped him buy a house, he bought me my first dog, etc. 

My girlfriend Safia- I’ve known her since last November. My gym buddy had been pushing me to meet her and despite me not really wanting a gf, it happened one day and we hit it off big time. I’ve known her 6 months and I can tell you right now she’s the fucking one for me. I can just tell you. 

She is never in a million years the type of girl I’d go for. She is completely out of my league. Lip fillers, makeup obsessed, runs around making friends with cats on the street, loves pink anything, calm as anything, has a degree in biomedical science, works for an organisation that *advises the bloody NHS* and is sharply intelligent. When I introduced Dave and Saf to each other I was sure they’d love each other. But nope. Despite me thinking Safia is the most interesting fucking person to walk this earth, Dave has been nothing but hostile to her and is openly rude. She first took it well and privately I apologised profusely to her. Asked Dave wtf his issue was and he called her a bimbo, vapid, etc. 

Since then it’s progressed into him openly calling her blondie (she has dark hair), him telling me she’s after my money, him telling me that I need to break up with her because she’s only using me and someone like her would never want to be with someone like me. Safia has said literally nothing about him, and I know she has an insecure streak where she feels like people don’t like her as it is, so naturally I’ve stopped seeing Dave as much. 

He’s called me drunk last night and told me how I’ve let a ‘loose pussy get in between him and I’ ... I’m honestly done with his guy. Am I doing the right thing by severing this relationship? In the last 6 months my life has been getting better and better- and coincidentally I’ve been seeing him less and less. Him disrespecting my girlfriend is the nail in the coffin as far as I’m concerned. 

TLDR: my oldest friend is jealous of my new girlfriend. I’m ready to let the former relationship go."
24,"UPDATE: Me [25F] with my fiance [27M] together off and on almost 3 years, engaged almost a year and a half, some woman [30s F?] won't stop messaging him and he refuses to address it?


[Original post here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/bkpr10/me_25f_with_my_fianc%C3%A9_27m_together_off_and_on/)

First of all, I want to thank everyone for their advice on the original post. Here's what happened afterward.

I showed my original post to J the same night I came here, and it originally really set him off to see other people saying that he was probably interested in T. He was in complete denial that her behavior indicated romantic/sexual interest in him, and he was furious that I had sought outside advice. 

But he made the mistake of complaining about the entire situation to his mother, who backed me 100% and informed him in no uncertain terms that for T to be blowing him up the way she was, especially given the fact that he had previously spoken to her regarding her behavior and she responded by no longer reacting to anything and everything he posted but continuing to message him constantly, was extremely disrespectful to me, to our relationship, and to him. She also told him that for him to leave my messages unread while jumping to respond to hers made it 100% understandable that I would question whether he was as interested in her as she appeared to be in him. Basically, she backed me 100%.

Being told off by his mom shook J up enough to start rethinking how he was handling things, but then not too long after that T began dating someone else in their clinic (we will call him R). Once T and R became an item, she stopped giving J the time of day, and J told me he was starting to think I was right about T. However, it soon became apparent that T was (and still is) using R to try to make J jealous; there was an incident where T posted a bunch of kiss face emojis to J's Facebook wall, and when he confronted her about it (after immediately deleting the post, though he now regrets not taking a screenshot first) she told him she did it ""just to piss [me] off."" This is when J realized that whether she has any interest in him or not, T does not have any respect for him or his relationship with me. He also decided that when she was no longer in his group (which is scheduled to happen on June 6), he would take her off his Facebook, but until then he just wouldn't interact with her online since her behavior the last time she was unfriended gave him reason to believe she would cause drama in group if he unfriended her again and he didn't want or need that.

Fast forward to last week. T texted J telling him she had just been kicked out, had nowhere to go, and was going to go buy and shoot up enough heroin to kill herself. I am pleased to report that while he did text back a few times, J only supplied her with two-word-max responses at first and when it became obvious to him that she was simply attempting to get his attention through manipulation (which was about five minutes after he got the first message), he stopped replying altogether. 

We saw R on the street while this was happening, and J debated showing him the texts; however, since he truly does not trust T not to start drama in group or just around the clinic in a way that could damage him and therefore affect his recovery, he elected not to for now. However, J has taken screenshots (he cannot retain texts due to his phone having almost no storage capacity, but all photos and screenshots are automatically sent to his Google Photos so he has an online backup); if something like this happens a second time, he will tell R everything and provide him with proof.

Basically, my posting this started a snowball in all the right ways. Thanks again, everyone!

**TL;DR:** J was originally furious at me for seeking outside perspectives regarding the T situation, but after being told that I was almost definitely right about her by his mother, he started thinking about it. T started dating another guy and originally ignored J completely, but then escalated her advances toward J out of nowhere for no stated reason other than spiting me and even tried threatening suicide to get his attention. J is now planning to cut her off completely as soon as she is no longer someone he sees regularly so as to minimize the risk of her starting issues that could negatively affect his recovery, and he has retained evidence of her behavior to show her boyfriend if anything else happens."
25,"Me [27F] with my husband [28M]. I feel he has inappropriate male friendships. Together 6 years.


Okay so, my husband and I have been together for 6 years and during the course of our relationship there have been a few red flags and I want to know if I’m going crazy.

One day, at one of his friends birthday party, his friend made another statement to the other... something like “oh that’s why I couldn’t suck you off (hahahha). It was completely weird to me and I was taken aback. 

I confronted him about this and he said that his friends go a little far with the homosexual jokes but they’ve always joked like that. Okay.

At a holiday one year, there was a question about my cousins sexuality (he’s 18, never had a girlfriend, my family was discussing this amongst each other). He literally was so defensive and arguing my family down saying “why are y’all questioning him”, “this is crazy”, he kind of embarrassed me. Okay. 

A few years ago I was on his Facebook and a man commented on his wall “_____ has a fat ass.” Now I don’t recognize this guy, he isn’t in his circle of friends or anything like that. In confronted him about that and he said he didn’t remember because it was old. Okay.

Recently, he befriended this new male coworker (I’ve met him). He and this male coworker work in the same area, and they talk a LOT. I mean FaceTime calls (over 35 minutes, which I always thought was weird because we hardly FaceTime). On his call logs he’s on the phone all day with this guy when he isn’t at work, he works with him all day as well. Maybe 8+ calls a day. Yesterday I looked on his phone (I know I know), and he’s deleted their entire text message log. 

When I’ve confronted him about this he gets really upset. I really want to know if I’m going crazy or are these major red flags. 

TL;DR - My husband has inappropriate male friendships and when I’ve asked him about it he gets super pissed. How do I go about this and is this normal?"
26,"(21M) My (20F) girlfriend is routinely hours late for plan we make, should I be mad?


I work over 50 hours a week and live a very schedule based life. Today we had planned that after I got off work from my night shift at 2pm, we would meet around 3ish and have our date night.

My girlfriend is a very loving and caring girl but is not employed and is out of college for the summer. We’ve been dating for about 7 months. She’s said she has nothing to do all week.

At 1:30pm she texted me she’s just now waking up and 3pm should work fine.

At 3pm she said she wanted to call her advisor and plan out her fall classes.

At 6pm she said she could never get ahold of them but she’ll figure something out.

At 6:30pm she said her friend is coming over to smoke for a while but will be there for less then an hour and she’ll be on her way.

The place we planned to go to closes at 9.

It is now after 9pm. I’ve been dressed and waiting for over 6 hours.

She is such a sweet person but this is a regular thing. I have very little free time and am happy to clear my schedule for her, but I feel like for her having a self described “completely open schedule” this kinda hurts and is disrespectful to our plans.

She just texted and said we’ll just do that place another day but she’ll be by “soon”.

Am I justified feeling so annoyed? Should I really make a big deal of it?

TL;DR:
Girlfriend has no obligations and is routinely 2-6 hours late for date nights"
27,"My(21F) friend's(21M) girlfriend(21F) wants me to keep my ""hands off her man""


I graduated today (yay!) from college and honestly would've had a wonderful day had it not been for the string of messages I woke up to this morning. Here's some back story:

Yesterday I was hanging with a bunch of my senior friends from school as a sort of last hurrah before we'd walk the stage the next day. Initially it was me and two of my guy friends until we got a message from another friend. Let's call him Jack. 

Jack's a former international student from central Africa ( I say ""former international"" because he actually recently obtained American citizenship!) and we've taken a class together before. He's also a senior who graduated today.

Anyways - Jack asked what we were up to, and we told him that we were hanging out and invited him to come join us. He said he would, and then asked that if it was ok with us, he'd also like to bring over his girlfriend (let's call her Jenny.)  None of us had any issue with it. Jenny doesn't go to our school but we'd met her before briefly and she seemed really nice, if not a little bit quiet. So we invited both of them to come join us. Once they arrived, we spent a good hour or so chatting and just enjoying some quality time before we decided to get some rest before commencement the next day. So we all hugged, made promises to take photos together after the ceremony, and went to sleep.

The following are the word-for-word messages that I woke up to this morning. (Other than their names, I haven't altered anything).

""Hi, musimin. I am Jenny, Jack's girlfriend; whom you met earlier. I’m using Jack’s phone to message you. I just want to tell you something.  I didn’t like the fact that you you hugged my boyfriend earlier when we’re leaving. African men don’t hug women/females. Especially those who have girlfriends/wives. Probably you already know that // Put yourself in my position when your man hug other girl in front of you! You know girls are jealous when it comes to their MEN! // I know you’re just a school friend/colleague, so please respect your limits......

I have heard many good stuff about you // But I don’t like/want you to hug my boyfriend like that. You would understand the feeling of that if you had a boyfriend. Other than that, it was great meeting you in person...! But please don’t repeat that again - I’m sure you wouldn't want other girls to do that to your boyfriend if you truly loved him""

So basically, on a day when I shouldn't have had to worry about anything, I woke up feeling both angry and confused. I'd never gotten this sort of possessive vibe from Jenny when we'd met her in the past and this seemed to come completely out of left field. Generally speaking - I hug ALL of my friends - I've hugged Jack before and he's never had any issue with it. He's actually the one who typically initiates them so I never thought it would be any sort of issue. I just felt completely blind sighted by the whole thing. 

Here are some things I'm trying to process. 1) I'm not sure if Jack knows that Jenny used his phone to message me, and how that should influence my response.  2) I'm not sure how to respond in a way that will maintain my friendship with Jack while convincing Jenny that I'm not after her man in any sort of way.

3) Her whole ""you would understand the feeling of that if you had a boyfriend"" was extremely condescending and just plain rude - I HAVE had boyfriends in the past and this whole thing was never an issue. I can understand the concept of cultural differences, (I come from a minority background as well) but I'm still confused as to how this is my ""fault"" - if anything I feel like this is a conversation that Jenny should have had with Jack instead of coming after me on social media. 

The whole thing honestly pisses me off. I'm planning on responding soon but would appreciate pointers of how I can respond gracefully. The most important thing is that I'm able to maintain my friendship with Jack but I'm not willing to let Jenny walk all over me the way she did.

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR - Friend's girlfriend didn't like that I hugged her boyfriend. Trying to figure out how to respond."
28,"My [26F] father [55M] contacted me out of the blue yesterday after 13 years. He wants to reconnect. Is it worth even trying?


Hi,

Long story so TL;DR at the bottom.

So my parents got divorced when I was about 11, my sister was 2. I was young, but still old enough to understand what was happening. My sister and I stayed with my mom (dad never tried to get custody) and we did the split weekends and holidays thing.

About 2, maybe 3 months later, my dad announced me that he'd met someone. I was surprised but genuinely happy for him. I didn't want to imagine him alone all the time so I was glad he had someone there for him when I wasn't around.

Shortly after, they moved in together (she also had 2 kids from her previous marriage), and around 6 months after the divorce with my mom got officially pronounced, dad and his new gf announced they were getting married.

To me (and a lot of people) it just seemed like they lied to us, and we're together long before the divorce. Obviously they never said that, always denied it. But getting remarried after 6 months is quite suspicious.

Anyways. So they got married. I got along quite well with the my now step-brother, we were around the same age). Not so well with his sister, who was younger and a real piece of work (her own mom's words). 
And no, I can't say I got along very well with my dad's new wife either. She was always hoovering the house early in the morning when we were still trying to sleep (no, she didn't have work to go to on weekends). Or calling my dad just to tell him I hadn't made my bed that morning. Very silly things like this, which seem like nothing when I think about them now, but can get annoying quite quickly when you're a kid.

So while my relationship with his wife wasn't going great, things weren't great at mom's either. One day we received a letter saying my dad didn't want to pay as much child support anymore, claiming he had too many debts.

Yes, he had of course. He was having a house built for him and his new family, and also had just bought a new BMW. On the other hand, my mom had only been working part time for quite a while due to illness, had to feed us, send us to school, overall raise us, but had no debts. Yet, he managed to win in court.

The whole thing, added to how bad I felt when I was at his place, just got me mad and I decided to see a lawyer to not have to go see him again. Which, was something I decided to do, so he should still have been taking care of my sister on split weekends and holidays. Yeah well, clearly he thought differently, coz she never saw him again either. She was 5 by then, and I was 14.

I tried to reconnect a couple times through the years, each time hitting a wall. The best message I can remember was 'if for you I don't have a wife, then I don't have daughters anymore'. 

The years went by, bringing their load of crap here and there. I honestly can't remember half of it anymore, except the part that completely broke me, years later.

I was then in Uni, in a city close to where my Gran (his mom) lived. I was still in contact with her, and very much loved her, so I would go spend the weekend at her place at least once a month and that made us both very happy. Until a year later, when he tried to stop paying child support altogether (illegal where I lived until the child had a job). This time my mom won in court, and he had to keep paying. He must have lied or manipulated my Gran, coz when I called her up one night to announce I just passed my License Degree, she was mad on the phone and blamed me for ''stealing my dad's money'', and then hung up. So that was it. My relationship with her was then destroyed, he got what he clearly wanted, and I didn't hear from her at all for years. 

Flashforward to 2 years ago, after moving to another country. Out of nowhere, I received a message request on FB from a friend of my gran's, announcing me that my Gran had cancer, and that she didn't have much longer to live. I booked a flight to go se her 2 days later, and went.

It was very difficult obviously. I was seeing my gran for the first time in many years, and she was dying. I tried to keep a smile, for her, and she was  overjoyed to see me. I don't think I'd seen her cry, ever, before this.

While I went to see her, I stayed at her best friend's place who generously offered her spare room for the couple days I would be there. We talked a lot and she told me my dad had called my gran's other friend (the one who found me on Facebook) and got furious at her for letting me know of the situation. Like, apparently, I didn't have the right to know that my gran was sick.

I then went back home, and took too long to call my gran and get some news. I genuinely wanted to keep in touch, but I have always been horrible with this kind of thing. Even my mom, with whom I am very close to and who is healthy, I sometimes take over a month before picking up the phone and catching up.

I tried to call 2 weeks after getting back home, and that was too late. The nurses told me on the phone she'd passed away a week before. I then called her friend, with whom I'd stayed over. She told me my dad had prevented her and everyone from telling me about my gran's passing.

That whole thing completely broke me, and I've been in depression ever since. I have hated my father for what he did, and hated myself for not picking up the phone any earlier, every single day since then. 

And now, fast forward to yesterday. Out of the blue, I got a message request on FB from my dad, saying he wants to reconnect. That he's out all his anger and resentment on the side and hopes my sister and I can do the same.

I don't see how this could even work. And I don't know if I even want this to work, or if I just want to tell him to go .... himself. I am very suspicious right now, and feel like the relationship is too far gone, way too broken by now to even be able to try anything at this point. 
I also really don't want to care, and yet I wouldn't be asking other people's opinions if I didn't care. 

My brain can't process this right now so that's why I'm asking you guys, to have some outside opinions. Should I try? Is it worth it? Or is this some new kind of manipulation and I should avoid him like plague?

TL;DR: 13 years of absence but also prevented anyone from telling me my grandmother had passed away. Should I still give my dad, who is now trying to reconnect, the benefit of the doubt and try to build something, or should I run for the hills?"

Background: In 6th grade I met a girl when I moved to a new school, I’ll call her Jane for the purpose of this post. Jane and I became the best of friends. Our relationship slowly fell apart in college when I discovered that she had sex with two previous boyfriend while I was dating them, and attempted to sleep with a third during high school. At the end of our friendship I started dating my husband, and he was never introduced to Jane. I did however tell my husband about my past friendship with Jane. 


Fast forward to 2017. Jane’s Mom became a professional mentor to me. I reconciled and reconnected with Jane. She apologized for her behavior, and we attempted to be friendly again. She expressed a sincere interest in attending my wedding, and I invited her after she asked multiple times. I was happy to reconnect and hangout with her because she had been such a huge part of my life. It felt good to have a long time friend back, but in the back of my mind I wondered if I could truly trust her. 


While attending my wedding Jane met my husband’s younger brother who was his best man. They had sex after our reception and immediately started dating. They dated off and on from Aug 2017 - Dec 2018 and my brother-in-law proposed to her after Christmas 2018. 


After their engagement Jane invited my husband and brother-in-law to a concert. I was not invited, and I did not find out about the concert until my husband was getting ready to leave. He said that he assumed I was invited and he thought I had turned down the tickets. I told him I felt excluded, however he decided to attend the concert without me. This made me feel horrible, but it was just one night and I decided to let it go. 


On Saint Patrick’s Day the three of them when out again. I wasn’t invited or informed about the plans, so I didn’t take the day off of work. Again, I told my husband that I don’t like being left out and I would like to be invited to future outings. When I returned from work that evening I found my husband passed out drunk in our doorway. I was fuming that they didn’t walk him inside, and I was even more upset that he was lying in his back. I told my husband how dangerous his behavior was. I also warned him about being blacked-out drunk around Jane. 


After St. Patrick’s Day Jane announced her bridesmaids. She selected two of our friends from childhood and a female cousin of mine that she met at my bridal shower. I found the selection of my female cousin to be unusual, because they only hangout when I host an event or hangout. My husband was also selected as the best man. 


I told my husband that I was surprised about the selections. He advised me that he had a three way phone conversation with Jane and his brother. Jane asked my husband if he thought I wanted to be included in the bridal party and he said “no, she is probably too busy with work”. I was crushed that my own husband answered without consulting me first. I felt so left out and excluded, but I didn’t want to impose my own feelings on Jane’s big day.


I later found out that I spouses weren’t invited to the rehearsal dinner, and I would not be seated with my husband during the reception. I was also told by Jane that the bridal party were having separate hotel rooms leading up to the wedding, and I would need to find separate accommodations. This made me super anxious as I don’t like traveling separately, and I didn’t like the thought of being alone during the entire wedding. 


My husband planned a Bachelor party for his brother. He planned to go to the Stagecoach  music festival with all of the groomsmen. He was really excited, and I was really proud of him for organizing the entire weekend (I usually have to plan all trip details). A day before he left I was watching Netflix on our shared iPad when a message popped up. The message was from Jane and it said “I can’t wait for stagecoach”. When he got home I asked him about it. He said that Jane was also going with four friends. I asked him why he hid the true nature of the trip and he said “I thought you knew she was coming”.  I later found out that none of the other groomsmen were going,  and it was just going to be my husband, brother-in-law, Jane, and her friends. 


I then found out that Jane had been DM’ing him of IG and texting my husband frequently. Jane planned the entire trip, and they both excluded me from the plans. My Husband went to the trip. I called him to make sure he arrived safely, and when he answered he was in Jane’s hotel suite with her group of friends. I was pissed and didn’t call him again.  


This entire experience has left me feeling rejected and ostracized. I told my husband that I will no longer be attending the wedding in August. I have also been thinking about a trial separation. My husband is my best friend and I feel heart broken. 


I notice lately that he seems embarrassed by me and doesn’t seem to want me around in social settings. I workout often, but my husband disliked that I often wear athletic clothing. I know I should put more effort into my appearance, but I’m so exhausted from wearing professional clothing, uncomfortable heels, constant makeup, and hair straightening during the work week. I just wish he liked me for me again. 


Am I overreacting? What could I do to resolve this? I love my husband and I hate that our relationship is spiraling. Any advice would be greatly appreciated. Thank you! 


TLDR; My husband and friend are excluding me from activities and planning trips without me."
30,"Boyfriend screams at me when i cry.


( i’m 18F, Boyfriend is 21M)

I’ve been with G for 3 years now. I need someone else’s advice because i’m biased with living with him and being comfortable with someone that i truly personally love, but i don’t know if this is abusive behavior or working on a relationship.. or if i’m just being plain irrational. This is going to be a long one because i’m going to try and give the entire story with good insight so i can get some serious honest answers from you guys. Thanks in advance :)

So this past year, a girl (we’ll call her K) is an old friend of G’s and they’ve been communicating. I know two things about her, that she’s his ex’s best friend, and that they used to have feelings for eachother and kissed once /messaged lovey dovey things to eachother in the past. I told G i didn’t want them talking anymore.

Yes, I know this is super irrational and the issue with G was he was pissed because I “wouldn’t let him have any friends” when in reality it is just this girl K i am uncomfortable with. I took this situation as him being disrespectful to me. They face timed and my mom over heard them talking because he lives with me and my mom over heard them, she told me they were talking about how we’re “all adults here.” like belittling me for feeling a certain way.

Fast forward to friday, G told me out of nowhere again after blocking her on everything that it was making him sick that i wouldn’t let them talk. he also told me that if i didn’t “get my shit together in two months” he was going to leave me amongst this argument that we had among with some other things. I took it upon myself to message her myself and let her know how i felt without being rude or anything like that... along the lines of “hey, i have nothing against you i’m just a little bit upset because you guys had feelings for eachother and that you’re his ex’s best friend.” and she responded by calling me nasty insults and threatening me with violence. i didn’t say anything mean in response, i just let her type paragraphs of insults. 

I told this to G, and he said “wow that’s disgusting i won’t contact her again i’m sorry.” 

this is where it gets kind of weird for me.  I then told him that i want him to talk to her and tell her he doesn’t want to talk to her anymore. He told me he didn’t want to get involved. at that point i’m thinking, “well you ARE involved because this whole thing unloaded on me because of you and K’s relationship.” the hurtful things she said were very very detailed and personal, having to do with what my genetalia looks like and how im a “faggy emo wannabe” and that she hopes we break up. things like that. I thought it was reasonable for him to tell her she was out of line since it deeply hurt my feelings and i spent my morning sobbing and distressed. he refused and proceeded to yell at me that he’s “done with my shit, and you both are immature asshole babies” 

i started to cry, and then he screamed at me at the very top of his lungs to “shut up shut up, shut the fuck up.” 

he screams at me like this when i cry because he can’t stand the sound of me crying, so then i cry more because i’m scared and it escalates from there. this has happened over our entire relationship.

after the mood died down a little bit i asked him if he would treat our children like he had just treated me if we had any, to that which he responded “i would beat the shit out of them if they acted *that* immature. 

when we got home, he apologized for everything and took it back. he would not treat our children like that. he’s sorry for screaming. he should have never said those things.. etc. then was mad at me for not accepting his apology. 

so all in all, i want to know if it’s my overreaction to this situation or if this is abusive behavior or both and what i should do about it.  

that was really long and i hope i can get some viable feedback! thanks for reading.  &lt;3

tl;dr boyfriend yells at me for crying after expressing emotions about a girl he’s talking to"
31,"My (F25) boyfriend (M29) won't save money unless it's for fun stuff. I need financial security


Background: together 6 years.  He has always been terrible with money and worked himself in quite some debt when we met. I got wind of this too late and was in too deep to just up and leave. My mom saved his ass by paying off his debt (to lose the interest rate on it) using her own savings. He is still paying her back to this day. Found out about 7 months ago that while he claimed to not have money (for anything and thus not for paying her back) that the money he did have went to drugs, which he used after his nightshifts - lying to me about where he was or at what time he got off work. Found out after matching his busspass check-in's and check-out's with out chat history. Waited at the buss stop for him, he texted me he had just left work while i saw him exiting the bus. This caused major trust issuess and me taking over his finances and watching his every move. He has since quit the drugs (or so he says; trust issuess) and is working on his finances with less interference from my part. 



Present: He is now working on his money and is, so he says, on track. He wants to get a kitten from a collegue to which i said that with the financial situation im not sure  its the right timing. I asked about how his money is going and that i saw him going to the shops more to buy junkfood and such. This all led to the topic in the title. 



Problem: He said 'I do not want to put away hard earned money now that I will only use to pay bills later, I will only save if it is put towards something fun like a vacation'. I told him that thats an unrealistic point of view, to which he said 'no, its just not your point of view'.  He wants to spend his money the way he wants to.   


I like financial security and i save up money for 'just in case'; unexpected bills, vetenary bills (we have 2 cats), etc. I might use some to treat myself once in a while but i always keep money aside. Right now im the only one saving up and its bothering me to the point where i know i dont want to live with someone so ademant on not saving up for an emergency fund. He said 'Even when I will get my vacation salary (Europe) I'd want to go do something fun with it but I would need to put it towards paying your mom or i would seem like the bad guy' - I told him that thats the repercussions of his own actions and that he is lucky my mom even did so to help him'. At this point he wallowed in self pity saying how everything is because of his own choices [sarcastic] and he walked away.



How do I handle this?

TLDR: boyfriend work work with me towards an emergency fund cause he does not want to put hard earned money aside only to pay bills with it later."
32,"Requiring permission from husband if I want to go out


I am 35 F married to 39M, we have been together for 13 years, married for 5 with 2 kids, 9 &amp; 10.

My husband has a fairly active social life, friends over on a Friday night for drinks, goes out regularly to the pub, plays AFL and has boys weekends / trips away, all which I’m all honesty I don’t mind, so long as for trips away I know in advance for child care planning, and day activities I have no issue, so long as we’ve done the things around the house we need too like grocery shopping (he is the only one who drives)

After work if he knows I am home (I work late evenings, until 8pm) he goes to the pub, normally without telling me. I let it go, I’m working 4 nights a week and understand the need for ‘me’ time.

However, when it comes to me going out after work or an overnight stay with girlfriends, regardless of if I do it spontaneously or plan in advance, I get guilt trips, accused of cheating, and generally made to feel like I’m doing something wrong.

How can I get him to understand how hypocritical this is? That I am an adult and able to make my own choices about socialising?
Is it normal to have to ask permission to be allowed to socialise as an adult?

TL;DR husband makes me ask for permission to socialise and tries to guilt trip me for seeing friends"
33,"My Dad (51M) keeps trying to make his step family ""happen."" Is it selfish for me to just keep my distance and focus on graduating college?


 

While a senior in high school, it became apparent that my Dad was having an affair on my biological Mother which completely destroyed her. After she succumb to addiction and depression, (incarceration) he promptly remarried and made his new family including my now stepmom (46F), her (28M) Son, and (18F) Daughter his own like nothing ever happened.

He keeps trying to invite me to his house even while I have previously voiced my discomfort in the presence of her home. Now, with my stepsister graduating high school, I've been invited to their celebration next week which I believe is going to double as ""guess who's coming to the same school as you next year?""

I genuinely hope this does not sound selfish, but It's almost like I am reading from a script every time I am there as to not disrupt the harmony of their adulterous union and it's so forced that every time I am there I countdown the minutes until I can leave without being ""short.""

Even worse, is the fact that during my senior year when the affair became apparent, I struggled with a lot of the abrupt changes which quite frankly uprooted my life. Most upsetting, is that I was just a few hundred dollars away from attending college that semester (my graduation year) but was unable to due to financial strains (him supporting two households for several years) and had to throw myself into graveyard shifts just to stay afloat which wrecked my psyche.

Now however, I am completely independent, a rising senior and working an internship related to my career/major. I believe my stepsister is planning on attending the same college as me since we are nationally ranked for the program she interested in and have heard whispers of it before.

&amp;#x200B;

I am wondering if it is selfish for me to not want to deal with any them?

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR

Dad keeps insisting I full assimilate to his new family even while **his** affair, financial secrecy, and overall disregard for others completely uprooted our way of life."
34,"I (36 f) decided to leave my separated still legally married boyfriend (39 m) of 18 months due to him having no divorce date set up yet. He blocked me when I told him to come back with me when he has divorce papers.


I (36 f) decided to leave my separated still legally married boyfriend (39 m) of 18 months due to him having no divorce date set up yet. He blocked me when I told him to come back with me when he has divorce papers. I’ve been in a relationship with a separated man for 18 months now with no date set up for a divorce yet. His wife wants the equity out of their home, but he can’t refinance because his credit is not the best. She is giving him time to work on his credit, but I know this can take another year. At this point I feel like he should sell his home , or get something in writing that states he will owe her the equity once he refinances and work on getting a dissolution with her. He won’t sit down and have an adult discussion with her about their options because he says it stresses him out too much. I told him last night without any moves from him and waiting on her to file I’ll always feel like I was second place. I told him to come back to me when he has a divorce date set, in the meantime it is tearing me apart waiting on them to make any moves. He got angry with me and said he will not be contacting me again since I don’t love him enough to wait. To me that just shows he never had any intentions to file or actually cared about losing me. Am I right in thinking this way, did I make the right choice?

TL;DR Am I being selfish for asking my boyfriend of 18 months to give me some kind of date when his divorce will be finalized? He says he can’t because the marital home is keeping him and his wife together until he builds his credit enough to refinance and give her the equity out of it. Once he refinances then he says the divorce can be filed."
35,"I [23M] invited my GF [21F] to a staycation at a nice hotel and now she's in tears (Details inside)


*Necessary background:*

*I am an American living in the Philippines and have been dating my girlfriend, who is Filipina, for a year and a half. If you asked me two years ago to imagine a better mix of intellect, keen wit, endearing goofiness, physical beauty, personal integrity and good manners I could not have described the amazing human being that is C---.* 

I planned an impromptu staycation in Manila this upcoming weekend. We're set to stay at a nice hotel and visit some upscale restaurants in town. When I broached the idea to her, she was neither reluctant nor particularly enthused so I, blockhead that I am, blithely continued planning. 

Cut to an hour ago when she asks if I would mind going alone. She begins crying, saying that she feels ugly, that she isn't pretty enough to visit fancy places. And then there's the factor which I hadn't even considered, which is that the pairing of white Westerner and local Filipina is a common occurrence in Manila, except that couples like this are all too often sex workers and their clients. It's a deplorable practice and unfortunate reality. 

If we go through with the trip as planned, I'm worried that my partner will continue feeling negative about her appearance and that she'll have to deal with the tacit assumption that she's my ""girlfriend"" for the night. 

Should I cancel? I know material gifts are not her love language and am definitely considering doing something else, only that the hotel stay was an exceptional deal and potential opportunity for us to enjoy some comforts this weekend if we can get past the negative perceptions.

**TL;DR GF worries she's ""too ugly"" for nice hotel and will be seen as callgirl re: local stereotype of white guys and their escorts. To cancel trip or no? Possible things I can say to her?**"
36,"My husband [24M] and I [25F] are starting to not feel safe around our neighbor [40ish M].


My husband and I bought our house last year. We live in an older neighborhood; many of the people are retired (save for a few). When we first moved in and getting to know the neighbors, we were told about a guy, let's call him John. Apparently, John had a history of not paying child support. He had spent some time in jail, and his home was in the process of being foreclosed. 

Definitely not what we wanted to hear after having just moved in, but we figured he'd be gone soon and wouldn't be a problem. That wasn't the case.

A few months after moving in, John knocked on our door, asking for favors. Trying to be good neighbors and not cause a riff, we obliged. (Maybe this was our first mistake) They were never big favors. Just borrowing sugar and using our cell phone a couple of times. However, about two months ago, he knocked on our door needing a ride to the local food pantry. Knowing there were kids living with him, my husband agreed to drive him and John's girlfriend. 

Now, this is when we got the full story of John from John's girlfriend. She basically told my husband what I believe to be a sob story. John ended up with his parent's house after they died. He had fallen behind on mortgage payments, had a history of drug abuse, and couldn't find work. She said their water had been shut off months ago and now they were borrowing water from a house down the street. Apparently, John had been caught siphoning water from our next door neighbor's house. No charges were pressed. My husband was also told the house was being auctioned off at the end of April. They planned to move out of state.

April passed. I found the records online where the house was auctioned off. Moving trucks came and we believed John was gone. Unfortunately, not the case. Two weeks ago, I was working from home when I heard the door ring. Being on a conference call, I ignored it believing it to be a delivery driver. The door rang again. Then knocking. Seeing it was John, I ignored him. I didn't feel safe answering since I was home alone. Since then, he has knocked on our door almost every other day. We've been ignoring him. Hoping he'd get the point. We've noticed he's starting to knock on other neighbors' doors as well. He's now borrowing water from our neighbor across the street. 

Last night is what has ultimately made us feel unsafe. I fell asleep on the living room couch and woke up around 1AM. The porch motion light was on. I heard my husband in the back bedroom on the phone. He was talking to the police. We assume John saw the light from the living room tv and rang our doorbell. My husband woke up and looked out the window to see John flipping him off. The police showed up shortly after the call but there really wasn't anything they could do. 

I'm now concerned John will retaliate. I don't know what our next option is. Any advice is appreciated.

TLDR; Neighbor has been foreclosed on and keeps knocking on our door asking for favors. Rang our door at 1AM. Police were called but there wasn't anything they could do. How to handle?"
37,"My [28m] sister [34f] was arrested for domestic violence and is asking me to post her bail


My big sister has always been a bit of a mess. She has gone through several messy relationships and has some serious alcohol issues. The rest of my family is the definition of put together. My parents are wonderful, present, and hard working. My brother is a social worker, and I am currently in medical school. My sister's life, on the other hand, has always been rocky probably as a direct result of her lifelong struggles with depression and anxiety. A few years ago it seemed like things were finally on track for her when she met and married this incredibly patient, kind, hardworking man who helped support her and get her working and thriving again. Despite this, her alcoholism and psychiatric illnesses have continued to be an issue for her and over time she has estranged pretty much everyone except me.

Last night my parents informed me she had been arrested for beating her husband while drunk. For some context, she is drunk almost every day and she frequently gets combative and emotional in this state so I doubt this is the first time something of this sort has happened but based on her husband's truly messed up face it appears this time it was especially bad. She was booked into jail and this morning she called me asking me to post bail. At this point, the only people who remain in her life are me and her husband so she didn't have many options. Of course I want to help and I am in a position to be able to do so, but my issue is that I am furious and frankly think she should spend some real time in jail. I have a lot of empathy for the mental illnesses she suffers from, but I think beating her husband is simply inexcusable and I have zero desire in a) spending my money getting her out or b) allowing her to come live with me (her husband has made it clear he is done and I don't blame him).

I think at this point she is either going to realize she's on a bad path and clean up her act or she is going to spiral out of control. Like homeless injecting drugs on the street kind of spiral. That may sound extreme from this snippet of a story, but based on all the context of her life I think it's a very real potential outcome here. Obviously I want the former of the two, but right now I am not in a place where I want to be her support system in getting things on track. I feel disgustingly selfish saying that, but she has burnt every bridge in her life - estranged our parents and brother and now beaten her husband. I want to be selfless and kind and support her so she can make the changes she needs, but I am in medical school. I work long and hard and my life is an exercise in controlled chaos as I train to become a doctor. I honestly don't have the emotional bandwidth to deal with medical school AND supporting my alcoholic sister in my apartment. But I don't know what the alternative is: let her spend some weeks in jail and then just be out on the street after her court date? Not helping her now doesn't sit right with me either. I do love her and want things to improve in her life.

Where is the line between being a bad brother and putting my life (which I have worked extremely hard on) first?

&amp;#x200B;

Tl;dr sister is an alcoholic with mental health issues. Arrested for beating her husband while drunk and because she has estranged everyone else is asking me to pay bail and help her get things figured out. I am in medical school and while I am technically capable of helping, I think she should spend some time in jail and I am concerned that I don't have the bandwidth to handle being her support system right now."
38,"I (30M) spoke to my wife (33F) last night about Sexual frustration and lack of intimacy issues I have been feeling and now I feel like a jerk.


Hi all, apologies in advance if this is turns into incoherent ramblings. My brain seems to be a bee hive of activity and feelings at the moment. 

So a little back story. My wife and I have been married a little over a year and have been together for over 3 years. We have never had a overly sexualized relationship, at most we would be having sex about 1 or 2 times a week. I am more sexually free and open about discussing sex / being sexual while my wife is more conservative about it. My wife is more set in what she likes while I am the one who tries to introduce new things or try new things. My wife doesn't like giving blow jobs and gets tired giving hand jobs but she does try to mix things up because she knows that I feel sex is more then just penetrative. 

&amp;#x200B;

Well for the past year in a half our sex lives have seemed to dwindle down to almost non-existent. We probably have sex once every 2 months and it has caused me to feel a lack of intimacy between my wife and I. The huge Elephant in the room that I have never brought up with my wife is that all of this seems to have started when her sister unexpectedly passed away about 2 years ago. I have tried to encourage my wife to seek therapy because she has never really addressed the passing outside of with her family when it happened. The problem with that is her family tends to lean on her for support so she took the brunt of their sadness and had to put hers aside to help support her family. I got her close to seeing a therapist but things keep coming up that stop her from being able to make an appointment. (since I believe this is a major contributing factor I wanted to bring it up early to give some context to why I feel like an ass) 

&amp;#x200B;

So back to what took place last night. My wife and I are in the middle of an amazing vacation that we have both been looking forward to for months. I work 70 hours most weeks and my wife works 40 hours a week herself so being able to actually spend a time together not worrying about work has been needed. 

&amp;#x200B;

Well were about 8 days into our 14 day vacation and most of the nights I have tried to get intimate with my wife and she seems to immediately shut me down. We will get into bed and I will start kissing her and she will kiss back and then grab her kindle and start reading romance novels. Then I will start to rub her tummy or rub her back and she will say that it tickles and ask me to stop. Well I have had trouble sleeping (time change) and while I do not mind my wife masturbating at all, I found that she was waiting until she thought I was asleep and then she would masturbate and go to bed herself. This has happened the past three nights and last night I just couldn't take it, I honestly felt abandoned by my wife. 

So last night after she finished herself I asked her if I could speak to her about something and she said sure (my wife and I have always been open to talk about anything/never fear asking each other questions). I then laid out how I have been feeling, how I feel that sex to her has become a chore. I explained that I am not just talking about wanting to have full sex. It seems that as soon as we get ready for bed she immediately starts reading and then shuts me down when I try to start fooling around. I have asked her several times to initiate more so I don't feel like the only horny one and while she says she tries she has only initiated once in the last year. I know my wife has self body image issues and told her that I know she has them but it would be nice sometimes to just lay down next to her when were both naked and talk. We went back and forth, not arguing, we were having a calm discussion about things and she never really was able to word why she doesn't feel like being intimate. I could tell that she felt guilty about not being intimate. She said that the masturbating is just to help her sleep. I know she honestly felt bad. Well after we talked we kind of laid there for a bit and then she rolled over and put her head on my chest and we laid there together and eventually she started giving me a hand job. After finishing up she said that she was sorry if she seemed isolated and assured me that the hand Job wasn't just an apology hand job (I told her during our discussion that I don't want her to have sex because I want to have sex but because she wants to have sex and that I don't just want to have sex with her but I want to do intimate things with her). 

&amp;#x200B;

Well this morning I woke up and I just feel like a jerk. I feel like my wife is going through things( again I honestly think this has something to do with her sister passing because it seems that this is when the dry spells started getting worse) and it is her vacation as well and I shouldn't just expect sex to happen because were on vacation. I feel selfish and feel like I maybe guilting my wife which I don't want to do. 

&amp;#x200B;

I don't know I just felt like posting and getting some opinions on the matter. I love my wife more then anything in the world and aside by the bedroom we have great times together and I honestly could not picture spending my days with anyone else. We communicate and never argue, in the 3 years we have been together we have never gotten into a fight. We have had disagreements but we are both very good about discussion and compromise. I want my wife to want to have sex and I just don't want intimacy to become a chore for her but I don't know what more I can do without feeling like I am guilting her.

&amp;#x200B;

Thank you for making it through my ramblings, I hope I kept pretty on point, if you have any questions please feel free to ask. 

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR! -  My wife and I have been having dry spells of up to two months, I feel abandoned and that intimacy and sex have become a chore to her. I told her last night and now I feel like a jerk because I feel like I am guilting her."
39,"My (27M) mother (58f) built a nursery for my son (0m) in her own home


Hello reddit... So my mother has been wanting grandkids forever, and she was very excited when me and my wife (30f) became pregnant with our first.

My parents are upper middle class and my mom likes to show affection by spending money on people. The closer we got to the due date, the more baby things she started buying. Things like $300 high chairs. My wife and I kept telling her not to do this, but this is kind of just how she is, and there's no stopping her. 

We figured these items were for us... But at the baby shower, she gave us duplicates of everything she had purchased. So those high chairs, strollers, car seats, playpens... That was for her home. ""For when he comes over!"" We don't spend much time with my parents... Honestly we try to spend as little time with them as possible, and it's mostly holidays or family events. We tried to gently tell her that if the baby needed things, we could just bring them from home... 

This is when I found out that she thinks she will be babysitting him everyday. M-F, while me and my wife are at work. 

We told her we had already picked out a daycare center, and explained as politely as possible that this isn't going to be happening. We live 30 minutes away and it's not feasible to drive over every day, and the daycare we picked is close by our home... She seemed to understand all of that, but still insisted ""sometimes"" she would be babysitting him, which we agreed \*might\* happen.

Then she started building the nursery. We told her, repeatedly, every step of the way, to PLEASE not do this because the baby will NOT be spending that much time in her home, but she did it anyway.

My dad used to work from home and had a home office attached to the bedroom. She has renovated the entire thing and turned it into a baby nursery.. One that is MUCH nicer than the one we have prepared (we are not at all as wealthy as my parents). It's stocked with state-of-the-art expensive furniture, all new toys and books, wall decorations with his name, etc. She has enough diapers and wipes stockpiled as if he's going to be moving in. It has security cameras in it so you can watch live feeds of the room from anywhere in the house, as well as baby monitors. The nursery we have for our son is nice, but it's... modest is a nice way of putting it. 

Mom sent the picture to me and my wife with the caption ""All ready for the baby!"" Which stressed my wife out so much. 

After the baby was born, my sister came to visit and jokingly mentioned that we'd be dealing with ""mom's crazy"" everyday since she'll be babysitting him. It turns out she has been telling the entire family (for MONTHS after our conversation) that she's going to be the babysitter 40 hrs a week, and didn't listen to us at all when we told her that wasn't the case. When my parents came to visit us in the hospital, I brought up the daycare multiple times, but I really don't know if I'm getting through to her. 

She ignored my wife's instructions on how to care for the baby in the hospital, pushing us aside and doing whatever she wanted with the baby. It was a brief visit and we were just waiting for it to be over.

It's been a few weeks now... We've avoided seeing my parents. They have tried to see the baby and given us very brief notice (""we're in your neighborhood, can we stop by!"") and we just ignore their messages then claim we were asleep. Aside from avoiding her, I don't really know what to do. 

TL;DR - Mom thinks she's going to be a major caretaker in the baby's life and won't listen when we tell her that isn't the case. She's spent thousands of dollars remodeling a nursery and buying fancy baby equipment. What do we do!?"
40,"I [28/f] want to stop sabotaging my relationship with my partner [29/m] when things are peaceful


To give more context, my household was constant chaos. Bickering and fighting was the norm, especially between my parents. The model for love I unconsciously inherited from my parents was seeing them yell at each other, go back and forth, walk away, and then come back to each other like nothing happened and still do things for one another. 

Translated into the relationships I have, I noticed that when things are calm and there aren't any problems, my mind searches for things to get upset about. I have this tendency to nitpick little things that annoy me or make me feel anxious, and then I explode or make a big deal out of it. When they come back to me or I see that they've forgiven me and want to be with me, my subconscious interprets this as love. 

I try my best to be mindful of when these behavior chains start to take place, but sometimes I feel so correct in my feelings, it feels wrong not to act out or to explode. I used to believe in that ""If you can't handle me at my worst, then you don't deserve me at my best"" but my therapist that that's all bullshit. I've come a long way at managing my emotions and being aware when I'm about to take part in destructive behaviors, but I'm anxious about my subconscious slithering its way in and finding its way to make things bigger than they need to be. It's as if I'm addicted to the drama.

My boyfriend has been dealing with this behavior for almost a year. He's still with me and expresses that he feels confident about me being healthy, but my behavior has impacted his mental health. He can't take me exploding at him anymore and he's terrified of my emotions. He's hanging by a thread and I don't want to lose him. I want to get better and I want to take actions and have a plan so that I can cease this behavior chain and way of thinking. Does anyone know what I can do to stop this pattern and unwire myself for chaos?  


TL;DR: Grew up with a skewed model for love (constant fighting, come back together regardless as if nothing happened), has carried on over to my relationships. How do I stop this pattern and need for chaos?"
41,"I (31f) am seriously considering divorcing my husband (35m) because of a cat


4 years ago, I got a kitten, and my husband agreed on the basis that I be the sole caretaker for her in all areas (feeding, litter, playing, etc). I was happy with this, as cats aren't much work (relatively) to begin with, and I am a stay at home mom anyways, so it wasn't an issue. 

Recently, kitty has been acting up a bit. Running away when I start the bath, hiding when DH comes home, startling at raised voices (which happens oftwn enough with a three year old in the house, hes a loud one). So last night, I think I figured out why. 

I heard kitty starting to scratch at the wall, and I don't think DH realized I was downstairs. I started walking over from the playroom to stop kitty, and then I heard a thud and a I turned the corner to see my husband had thrown the remote at my cat. I was instantly furious. Like, it honestly might have been too much, but everything just clicked and I realized what had been happening. I started screaming at him, I said ""Have you been abusing my f***ing cat?"" and he said ""I didn't even hit it, I just scared it away"". So long story short, we had a very loud argument and it came to light that he has been throwing stuff at my poor kitty and spraying water on her with the sink spray thing (those nozzle kinds that are almost like a hose) to ""keep her away from the kitchen"". 

I am so mad at him. I have no idea how long this has been happening, but kitty has been acting odd for a few weeks at most. I cannot understand how I married a man who would do this. Is divorce too much? I don't know what I would do, probably go back with my parents, since I would have to find a way to support myself. Kitty literally hides from him when he comes home. Who even knows if he does other stuff that he isn't admitting to. I made him leave the house and he is staying with his brother until things calm down, but I am wondering what other people would do? Like.....am I overreacting? I know what he did was terrible, but is it a normal response to divorce him over it? I don't know who to talk to, because I don't actually want him to get into trouble, and I don't want people we know irl to know I married a gut who does shit like this to animals.

TLDR my husband has been terrorizing my cat for who knows how long and I caught him. I am now considering divorce, but am unsure if that is truly the best course."
42,"My boyfriend [31M] asked me [33F] to choose between him and my late husband in the afterlife.


Basically the title. I'm 33F, my boyfriend is 31M, my late husband was 32M.

I was with my late husband for 3 years but we had known each other since we were 15. He was my first true love and we reconnected some time later. I loved him desperately and 2 years ago he passed away very unexpectedly. It's been very hard to move on with my life but I met my boyfriend last summer and things have been going great. (We've been together almost a year.)

My boyfriend knows everything about my late husband and up until recently he's been very understanding and patient. I made it clear when we started dating that it was very difficult to ""move on"" and that I would always love my late husband. When we first started dating I'm sure I talked about him a lot because I was still grieving pretty heavily but as time has passed I learned to curb talking about him too much as sometimes it hurt my boyfriend's feelings.

The other night we were in bed and I could tell something was bothering him. I pressed, and finally he got very emotional and said he wanted to ask me something but he knew it was ""selfish and irrational and stupid"" and that it would make me very upset. But seeing this thing was weighing on him so heavily I told him to go ahead.

He's an emotional guy when he gets upset but he was full-blown crying when he asked me, apropos of nothing -- we hadn't talked about my late husband AT ALL in recent memory, and as far as I know nothing came up that would warrant this -- ""If you had to choose in the afterlife between me and \[husband\], who would you pick?""

I was pretty shocked and took a minute to answer. My first response was ""I think that's a hard question because you know I'm an atheist and I don't believe in an afterlife."" He said ""I know.""

I went on to give as honest of an answer as I could, which was that I love my late husband very much but I love him too and that ultimately he is the one I'm with. It's not like I had an option between my boyfriend and my husband, but I DID have an option of whether to choose anyone ever again, and I chose him (despite not even wanting to date anyone when we met.) I said we should focus on the present and the future and that I was so lucky to have him, which I guess in the end isn't really an answer to his question.

That seemed to satisfy him and he calmed down but now I'm feeling very weird about the whole thing. I think it was a very unfair question to ask, because how am I supposed to pick between the love I lost and the love I found? I don't think I should have to. And the whole idea of ""whose table in Heaven are you going to sit at"" seems incredibly juvenile and stupid.

I love my boyfriend very much and I'm looking forward to our future together but I'm not sure how to proceed. It's hard for him to open up about deeply emotional things so I think it would be counterproductive to be upset with him for this question but I also don't want to be put in that position ever again. I don't want to have to ""choose."" I want to still be able to wear my husband's old t-shirts if I feel like it, enjoy the movies and songs we enjoyed together, have memories of him around that make me smile without worrying it's going to destroy my boyfriend emotionally.

It's obviously a sensitive subject so how do I approach this with him, and how do I deal with my feelings of how unfair it is and how I don't want to choose between the two of them?

&amp;#x200B;

**TL;DR:**

**My boyfriend asked me to choose between him and my dead husband in the afterlife. I don't want to choose but I gave him an answer about how much I loved him but will always love my late husband as well. I feel weird and upset that he asked me this question and put me in this position but I don't know how to talk to him about it without making him shut down emotionally in the future.**"
43,"I believe my (29F) wife is burying my (33M) life in stress. I need help.


Im going to try and make this as brief as possible but I have a lot to get off my chest.  My apologies.  

\*\*TLDR\*\* My wife is involved in animal rescue and I have been unable to curb her involvement.  It has directly, negatively impacted my life and she seems to disregard my wishes.\*\*

&amp;#x200B;

My wife and I have been married for the better part of 6 years.  we have 2 children together.  She has been involved in animal rescue since I knew her.  We both volunteered time to it.  It went from going to rescues to volunteering time to becoming a rescue.  Its all great and good when a new dog comes in, but our life and home have paid dearly for it.  

&amp;#x200B;

The immediate thing on my mind, and key contributor to my stress is our home.  It is absolutely destroyed.  As I type this I hear 2 puppies chewing on a door I just dont give a shit about anymore. Our back and front door, chewed up.  My kitchen cabinets smell like cat piss from a cat that cant control itself.  My son's room is currently tied up by 3 kittens.  This is my life.  I have begged and pleaded for her to stop and it just never stops.   

&amp;#x200B;

The worst part is a family member's home has come up for sale.  It is in a nicer neighborhood, assigned to the school my daughter goes to and my son will go to.  Its our only shot to get in this neighborhood because it needs work but we have access to offer the appraised value (Im fairly certain it would go over appraisal in an open market).

&amp;#x200B;

I have asked my wife to a) stop animals coming in so I can start repairing our home and b) take some ownership of this mess and help clean.  She has done neither.  I am nearly certain the chance to put an offer on the home is going to be taken away from us since our home will seemingly never be ready to sell.  Ive told my wife about this opportunity almost a year ago but communicated to her this summer was going to be make or break.  And yet here we are, the appraisal was done last week, we can afford it, and my home is in utter disrepair.  

&amp;#x200B;

Short of telling her that its our marriage or the animals... Ive tried a lot.  Maybe not the right things. conversations quickly escalate, even when I dont want to get in a fight.  I jsut want to talk. Its frustration from her. Yelling from her.  Im so sick of it. My blood pressure is through the roof, despite significant diet changes and exercise 5x a week, my wife just cant seem to figure out what the fuck it is, but I know its the stress.  Its always in my mind.  

&amp;#x200B;

Im drowning.  I think maybe a therapist would help; we have tried couples counseling but it always turns against me for petty shit, like spending too much time not on the couch to watch shows with her, or wanting to clean every night and thats just unrealistic and not what everyone else does or whatever.  I try to get in to my stuff and its just shot down. I need a therapist to help pull together talking points."
44,"My wife [40F] and I [40M] married for 15y. She had a secret STD test, what is it besides cheating?


Hi relationships, I’m using a throwaway account for obvious reasons.

I was signing our kids up for an activity online. The account is under her name, so i hopped on to my wife’s laptop and asked her for the password. She has like 5 email accounts that she uses. So while I’m looking for the one with the correct login info, I see that one of her accounts has a bunch of unread spam. But there are some read messages, all from some random guy I’ve never heard of. Weird. Basically they’ve messaging sporadically since the fall, and while some of them are of a sexual nature, at worst it’s an emotional affair. There’s no plans to meet up at all. Fine, I can get past that.

Of course at this point I do a little more snooping. Then I see she had an STD test ordered online and the blood sample drawn at a random clinic... paid for with cash... outside our health insurance coverage. Hmm, this is the first I’ve heard of this. I haven’t checked her phone yet for further evidence. And I haven’t spoken with her yet.

I’m little crushed right now. I want to give her the benefit of the doubt. What else could it be besides cheating? I’m not necessarily looking for serious answers either; I could use a laugh right now. Thanks.

TL;DR did some (I think) justified snooping on my wife’s accounts, saw she had an STD test ordered online and the blood sample drawn at a random clinic... paid for with cash... outside our health insurance coverage. What else could it be besides cheating?"
45,"I'm (19/f) not happy at home and its effecting my mental health. What do i do?


Some background about me: I am a 19 year old girl, with muslim parents. I, however do not believe in the religion and my family does not know this. I have a serious boyfriend  (hes white so my family dont know about it) and enjoy going out drinking and spending time with my friends going to festivals or on holidays (which im not allowed to do), normal stuff a girl my age enjoys to do.

&amp;#x200B;

For the last year, ive been finding it depressing and sad whenever i am at home. I am fine when i am with my boyfriend or friends but when I am at home and have to pretend to be some perfect muslim girl who prays and does ramadan i feel lonely, sad and depressed and its really starting to take a toll on my mental health over all. Its making me resent being around my family as i have nothing in common with them and dont agree with anything they do especially my dad. My dad forces me to pray and read the quran and fast (even though i dont when im out the house). I'm allowed out with permission but whenever i am i get asked loads of questions and when i return from having a really nice day i come home to my family making me feel guilty about not being at home and always being out  even though most people my age have moved out and im only doing the stuff any other girl my age would be doing. Its really starting to effect me and makes me cry every night knowing that no matter what i do during the day i have to come home and be someone completely different thats not happy. 

&amp;#x200B;

My parents let me stay over places but in order to go on nights out and i have to stay over at someones after and because of this my parents only let me stay over occasionally (never during the week) and i have missed out on doing so many things with my friends including a holiday they all went on last year because i wasnt allowed to go. Its also effected my university life as all these girls spend 24/7 with each other and i cant because im not allowed out so because of this its been hard to make any new friends. 

&amp;#x200B;

I see my boyfriend every weekend (he has work during the week) and its becoming hard to balance this, friends and my family as the weekend is the only chance i get to see my friends or boyfriend but my family make me feel bad for not wanting to stay at home. 

&amp;#x200B;

I have a well paying part time job and a student loan. I would love the idea of moving into student accommodation next year which i could pay for with my loan (as that is what it is for) however, my family wouldnt allow me too especially my dad. My mum may accept it but my dad would throw a fit about it and kick off saying im not allowed to move out until im 21 and that he wont allow it. If i did go through with it id have to probably accept the idea that my dad wouldnt talk to me again. Which sounds really bad but i dont think i mind as i dont agree with anything he stands for or says. We barley even talk because everything he says to me is either negative or telling me what i can and cant do. 

&amp;#x200B;

My boyfriend is white and understands the situation, even said i could come live with him if i needed too i just dont know how to go about all this i just know i need to do something as i feel trapped and sad at home all the time and i hate being around my family. 

I just feel like my mental health is really struggling and i shouldnt feel like this at home or about my family. It also cant be very healthy to be 2 completely different people everyday. My parents know nothing about me. I feel like moving out may help me not feel as hateful towards my family and maybe  make me want to spend more time with them?

&amp;#x200B;

If i do chose to go with student accommodation how do i deal with my dad and telling my family? hes the most unreasonable person ever and once his mind is set on something theres no changing it. He wont be accepting. Any other ideas of what i could do?

&amp;#x200B;

TL:DR; being at home around my muslim parents when i am not is starting to effect my mental health and make me depressed but my dad wont allow me to move out easily. What do i do?"
46,"My (24F) long-term friend (24F) asked everyone in the friend group to be in her wedding but me.


I want to start this off by saying that absolutely no one is obligated to ask ANYONE to be in their wedding, and I understand that completely, and that's not what this is about. I'm not angry at all and her wedding isn't about me, and I know that. 

Just a quick backstory- I've had a childhood group of friends from around 2nd grade, one of them being my cousin. Her, my friend (we'll call her Mary), and I were kind of the 'three musketeers' if you will, and we tacked on a few more friends to the group through school. We've all been through a lot together, considering we've all been friends for nearly our entire lives. 

Life happens, and we had a brief falling out a few years ago (I was dealing with really bad depression, she was in an emotionally taxing friendship with someone she's since cut out of her life) but never any major conflicts. Just didn't talk as much for a while. She had a child 6 months ago, and our lives are busy in different ways, but I still reach out to her. We've all been spending time together as a group lately again, and things felt like they were back to normal. 

Anyway, she's getting married next year. Scrolling through facebook, I start seeing photos from friends in the group of their cards from her asking if they would be a bridesmaid- including one friend that's only been hanging around us for maybe two years. This really, really broke my heart. I started to really feel like maybe I was a bad friend, or there  was something that I did along the way to make our friendship less valuable to her. I had planned to have her in my wedding in the future. It's going to be really hard seeing my group of friends be a part of her wedding while I sit and watch. 

Has anyone dealt with something similar, and if so, how do I cope? I don't want it to effect my relationship with her, but i'm very hurt about it, and I don't know if I will feel the same about our friendship after this. And not only that, I feel selfish for being hurt in the first place. Part of me was really hoping she would address it, because I don't plan on speaking to her about it. 

Any advice? I'm not sure how to get past this hurdle.

TL;DR- Friend of 15+ years who has a small circle of friends including me asked everyone but myself to be a bridesmaid- not angry, just very sad and unsure how to move forward."
47,"I (22f) am supposed to have dinner with an older man (40s) tonight and am realizing how ridiculous this situation is and I need out


I'm part of a club in my community and it's run by a very attractive 40 something man, the type of person I imagine myself being with 20 years down the road.  Anyhow, we were talking one afternoon (in a club context) and he invited me over to make a meal.  Thought maybe it was an avuncular action, idk... I'm moving states, was telling him that I have very little food in the house.  Thought his offer was out of good will/concern, people in the club tend to take care of each other-- it's very close knit.  I'm also very passive and realize now that I was performing mental gymnastics to make it seem not romantic/sexual and nature (admittedly I was feeling lusty), and so agreed.  I've been mulling over it and have noticed some other things he said/how he looked at me and now am like YOU ARE SO NAIVE, TEAQUIERO.  

&amp;#x200B;

I'm supposed to go over in an hour (so apologies for frantic writing style).  I like him and might move back to the area and would like to be part of the club again still without it being weird. I don't think he's a bad guy at all, and obviously I've given some mixed signals. Although I think he's good looking and interesting, I'm not in a place to sleep with a  man who is almost 50.  

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR: Stupidly accepted dinner date at much older man's house.  I'm supposed to go over in an hour and am having buyers remorse.  How do I politely get out of this"
48,"Me [36/F] with my Mom [66/F], she found my twitter and stopped speaking to me


My Mom and I have a strange relationship, I grew up in abusive household with my father being very emotionally/verbally abusive. And my mother basically enabling him. My parents are still together, and they pretty much refuse to acknowledge the abuse I grew up with, even though I wound up spending my 15th birthday in a mental hospital and was chased out of the house and disowned because my father opened my cell phone bill and thought I was being irresponsible, and ended up temporarily homeless and sleeping in my car.


So we have this strange sort of song and dance where they love me and are so proud of how far I've come in my life! And we never, EVER speak of the fact that I was abused. Let alone apologize. I've had a twitter account for eleven years where I'm careful not to link it to myself via Facebook or Instagram because I have family members there, and I occasionally will vent about my Mom or my Dad there. And for 11 years it's been safe to do so.


Until two months ago when my sister found it, and told my Mom. My Mother got furious over a series of tweets where I wished she would go to therapy and deal with the crap our family had been through.


My Mother is refusing to speak to me, and has the immediate family with her on it. Having gone through being disowned before, I was like whatever. I live in another state than the rest of them, so I'm not missing much. Then I got in a serious car accident and my car was totaled. And my Mom still refused to speak to me. 


I have apologized repeatedly. Sent Mother's day presents. Left voicemails (because she won't take my calls). None of my other family members will speak with me. My extended family has my back, thankfully. And is really upset with her. But I don't know what to do about my Mom and my immediate family. Especially since my Father's birthday is coming up.

TL:DR My Mom found my Twitter and is refusing to speak to me, and so is my immediate family."
49,"My (F27) ex-friend (F26) and ex-boyfriend (M27) are engaged. I'm becoming obsessive over it.


About 2 years ago my then-boyfriend (""A"") of \~3 years broke up with me. We had lived together for 2 years. I moved out, went no contact, and eventually started dating my current partner.

Months after the breakup, my good friend (""B"") started dating A (full disclosure: B and A were/are best friends; B and I were very close, but not \*best\* friends).  I found out that they were dating when B sent me a short text, not sure how long after they got together (what a great friend....).  I basically cut them out of my life, which wasn't too hard because B lives in a different city, but was still cordial whenever I had to see them in person.

A few weeks ago, I found out that B and A got engaged.

It's been over 2 years since A and I broke up, a few months under 2 years since I began dating my current boyfriend, and 1.5 years since A and B got together, but the same knot in the pit of my stomach is back. The same seething resentment and anger that I just can't control.

Why do I feel so betrayed by their engagement? I know I need to get over it, but the bitterness I feel seems to be bottomless.  And the fact that all of our mutual friends are celebrating and congratulating them just exacerbates the feeling.

And my best friend, who lives across the country, is still good friends with B, so I can't really discuss it with her either, and frankly, I still feel a little hurt that she's kept up a friendship with B (even though I know I can't expect her to take a side considering A and B technically didn't do anything ""wrong"").

I get that exes can date whomever they want and that I'm with someone else now...I just have this irrational urge for there to be some type of reckoning where they are shamed for the pain that they caused me.

I'm having trouble suppressing my negativity and anger, and at the same time feel guilty about hurting my current partner when he sees that this is still impacting me. I also just feel humiliated and duped, because to others it must look like I was just a stepping stone for A on the way to B, and that A had feelings for B the whole time and just discarded me when the time was right.

Can anyone relate or suggest coping mechanisms? (I do see a therapist).

TL;DR: My (F27) ex-friend (F26) and ex-boyfriend (M27) are engaged.  I'm jumping for joy (eye-roll)."
50,"BFs (25M) change in work schedule caused me (23F) to lose $500 in concert tickets and hotel reservation. His parents (50s M/F) work in the company which complicates it, I feel like he should pay me back half but he disagrees. Together ~18 months.


My BFs parents work for a shitty company but they're basically lifers. Both started when they were 15 or 16, met at a company function at 19 or so, fell in love, got married. 

Neither have ever worked anywhere else. They're both higher ups now. 

Of course they got my BF a job as soon as be was old enough to work. A typical high school job, a few hours a couple nights a week in a very simple entry level position. He's worked his way up into the IT department. 

This company is fucked from hell to breakfast, as my grandma would put it. A few years ago the CEO resigned. He put his son in charge. 2 years later the son died in an accident and his daughter took over. Daughter is an art major who knows NOTHING about running a business much less a company. Not hating on art majors. She's just way out of her depth. 

She restructured a bunch of shit and put a bunch of idiots in charge. One such idiot runs my BFs dept. 

This guy has flown in the face of every labor metric and statistic and keeps tweaking the operations of the dept. He's just throwing shit at the wall and hoping something sticks. Every other month the schedule changes. Every other month the territory changes. 

3 months ago - *three months ago* - my BF and I planned a vacation. We were going stay in a hotel a few days and see a concert. Welp the schedule changed. 2 weeks before the trip. I tried to StubHub the tickets but they're kind of a local-ish niche band. They didn't sell. I couldn't cancel the hotel without paying half the cost of the room in cancellation fees. 

I had tried to find a friend to go with, or someone who may want to take a friend or partner of theirs, but it was such short notice that nobody could or wanted to. 

So a little over $500 got flushed down the toilet. 

This was a few weeks ago and I thought I was just mad about the situation. I'm not. I'm actually mad at him. Work has eaten his life but yet he refuses to even LOOK for another job. No guarantee he would find one, or find one soon, but he won't even try. He's about to end up a lifer like his parents with his ""I worked my way into this position, I don't have certifications, no other company would hire me."" He's pretty much already salary capped for his position. The only other move to make is department manager. And I don't think he would put in for that if it ever became available. 

He also doesn't want to rock the boat with his parents. He was 16 when he started, I don't think anyone looks at him like ""Bob and Sue Smith's"" son anymore but he thinks they do. He feels like he has to make his own name and he can't do anything which would reflect badly on his parents. 

When he told me he couldn't take the trip, it was basically just like ""Well there's nothing I can do, sorry"". We already can't plan anything. We planned this MONTHS ago and it cost a decent bit of money and he never even tried to say ""Wait. Not cool. I'm out of town that weekend."" 

Just ""Well that's what ""Jim"" wants, I can't do anything about it.""

I paid for 100% of the trip and concert. I asked him to pay me back $250. He got angry and said ""Oh so if I'd been in a car accident and couldn't go, you would think I owe you money for it? Life happens.""

Life does happen. And maybe he wouldn't have been able to take off in the end. But he never TRIED because he's so in mom and dad's pocket, he's never worked anywhere else so he doesn't see how fucked up this all is and other businesses do NOT run so inconsistently and change everything so frequently with no notice. 

This wasn't an act of god like a sudden illness or an accident or a storm. This was an adult man pissing away my money because he can't upset mom and dad. 

We've reached an impasse on it. Am I really being that unreasonable about all this? The fact that he so staunchly defends this fucked up job is making me question our relationship, as is the fact that it's mostly because of mom and dad. They tell him this is The Way It Is and he just swallows it. 

How do we resolve this or should I just call the $500 an asshole tax and move on? 

tl;dr BFs toxic workplace where his parents also work cost me over $500 on a trip we couldn't take and he just shrugged off. I asked him to reimburse me half. He thinks it's just a case of ""life happens"". Should I cut my losses or try to resolve this and if so, how?"
51,"My [30M] ex [27F] told everyone something personal about me.


Hi all. 

&amp;#x200B;

I split from my ex Laura about a month ago. We were together for about two years but it wasn't working so we decided to end it, and I know she believed it was entirely my fault. However, we have a lot of mutual friends, and recently I found out everyone knew something about me that I had been doing my best to keep secret. 

&amp;#x200B;

I have a bit of a foot fetish. Nothing serious but something I prefer to keep to myself. It's quite frowned upon so I ignored  it and at first Laura and I had quite a ''vanilla'' sex life. However, she's smart and perceptive, and it didn't take her long to figure out that I liked her feet. I said she didn't have to do anything she didn't feel comfortable doing but she agreed to give some stuff a try. It was unfamiliar to her at first but after a while she started to enjoy it (or so she claimed anyway) and actually started initiating foot-related stuff. 

&amp;#x200B;

However, since we broke up all my friends have been asking me if I had a foot fetish, and I didn't lie to them, and they said they heard it from people I knew were friends with Laura. I texted her about it to ask if she told anyone, and she responded, ''Yeah I did, so?'' and hasn't responded to anything else I've said. 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm absolutely furious. This was something very personal to me which I made efforts to avoid people finding out, and she thinks its funny to blurt it out for the whole world to hear.

&amp;#x200B;

Should I confront her about it or let it slide?

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR: My girlfriend told everyone about my sexual desires and now all my friends know."
52,"My [19f] sister [15f] is really really disgusting and I feel like I'm the only one that is seeing it!


My sister has a lot of personality issues and we have never gotten on. I can't consider her a part of my family in my mind as I am so revolted by her personality and hygienic habits. For years now she has not been flushing toilets, and washing hands after 1's and 2's. This may seem funny but it is not. She clogs the toilet nearly every time, and it is disgusting. I am the only one that cares, as everyone else in the family is too nice to tell her off as she also has this other terrible habit of just screaming in everyones faces incredibly loudly. My parents are almost scared of her so they go the other way and spoil her with whatever she wants. As well as this, she also does things at the age of 15 remember, as eating with her hands at the dinner table. I can't get across how horrible it is to live with her when you are the only one that seems to care. I have spent so much time trying to get her to simply flush the toilet after using it but with no success. 

I think she might have some sort of autism to still not be able to do it but again I seem to be the only one concerned.

Today I found out she has been sleeping in my room while I was away for a few days and not only does my room straight up smell like pee now, she left her things all over the floor. When I went to clean it up, I found a personal item of mine (if you get my meaning) that was moved from a drawer. This part is really what made me snap and write this as I just cannot figure out why ***anyone*** would touch someone elses personal item (and move it!!!) like that when ***literally*** anyone else would never dream of it in a million years. (Have since thrown it away) I just think that is so disgusting and it makes me sure that a) there is something wrong with her and b) we will never be on the same page and be able to have a relationship.

Does anyone have any advice? I can't live like this.

TL;DR my sister is so gross and seems to have a much younger mental age, my parents try not to see it, but it's driving me crazy - what can I do?"
53,"My (28F) boyfriend (25M) of three years doesn't find me sexy. I've always had issues with my looks and I am having trouble accepting it.


Hi,

I'm not super sure where to begin here...so I'll preface:

From being sexually and emotionally abused as a child to an absurd amount of people, oftentimes adults, commenting on my looks starting when I was about 6, I've reached a point where I completely disassociate when I have to use the mirror and honestly can't even picture or imagine what my face looks like. I feel like I look like the scary monster nun from ""The Nun"", even though deep down I know I don't. People my whole life have felt the need to tell me that I'm ugly, uglier than them, uglier than their daughter, uglier than that girl over there. I have never heard of anyone else having this problem, I don't know what it is about me that makes people want me to know that I don't compare, but it happens all. the. fucking. time. So that's my starting point, I have a completely fucked up and damaged view of myself, I am definitely experiencing some dysmorphia, and I don't believe people when they do compliment me. I feel uncomfortable and embarrassed all the time to show my face.

All that said, I know somewhere deep down that I'm not hideous. I have a great body that I love, a plastic surgeon told me I didn't need a nose job when I went for a consultation, and I do not feel like I can complain about being/feeling ugly because people either don't take it seriously or think I'm seeking attention/validation. So, I have been bottling these feelings and frustrations up for a very long time.

Now, about a year ago, while talking about this with my boyfriend (of three years), he mentioned that he thinks I am pretty but I'm not sexy. 

I feel like all the issues and feelings and frustrations with my looks from my whole life have just bubbled up and burst like that statement was the mento in a coke bottle. I have talked and talked and talked and asked him a million questions and he just point blank thinks I'm not sexy and I can not accept it. He says I could be but he's not sure how. I try to ask him what exactly is sexy to him, who he finds sexy, but at this point we are just both getting frustrated with the conversation because he says I don't need to change and I'm annoyed that I  would need to change everything about myself in order for my boyfriend to think I'm sexy.

I don't want to watch shows with sexy women, I feel resentful of him, resentful of women who are sexy, resentful of my own body for the first time I have a problem with my small boobs because he once told me he prefers big boobs. I don't know what to do. He doesn't understand why it's an issue for me, he says he doesn't want me to change to try to be sexy. It's starting to affect our sex-life and my feelings toward him. I feel like the biggest problem here is my own mental health issues. I was first put in therapy when I was 8 and have tried off and on, but I find the tools they give me to be frustrating and it makes me feel angry. I just feel completely lost and alone and so fucking ugly I can't stand it. I am at a complete loss. 

In every other way, our relationship is fantastic. I love him, he is so kind, supportive, honest, helpful, and overall one of the best men I've ever known. It started out as a purely sexual relationship, and we had never had sex issues before this. So, to him, my lack of sexiness doesn't affect his desire to have sex with me. I don't know. Reading this back to myself, it just sounds like I need therapy.

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR; I have issues with the way I look and my boyfriend tells me I am not sexy. I am having a lot of trouble accepting this and it's starting to negatively affect our relationship and sex life"
54,"I (30f) am about to spend a weekend with a couple who knew my husband (31m) of less than a year cheated long before I knew


I’ve recently found out my husband has been hiding a sex addiction from me for the past 5 years (we’ve been together 7, married less than a year). Lots of new information has come out over these past 5 weeks, including the fact that he was at a house party this couple hosted and had sex with a girl in their living room after everyone had passed out. He woke his friend up to get a condom and met with him the following day to apologize, so I know 100% that they knew. This was approximately 2+ years ago, before we were married. 

This is a very trying time for me as I learn to navigate all of these emotions and come to terms with all of the lies. Husband is in therapy, goes to daily meetings and has made lifestyle changes so I’m waiting to see what happens. I’m not sure if we can recover, but I am willing to see if I think it’s possible. 

In the meantime, I’m looking for advice on how not to hold resentment towards these friends. They knew. They could’ve told me or forced him to tell me and we could’ve caught this ages ago. We could’ve gotten help sooner. And we could’ve held off on the marriage. 

The guy is very close friends with my husband, so I don’t really blame him but can’t understand how his gf would go along with all of this. She’s older then us by quite a bit and knew her own bf’s last relationship ended in cheating. 

A note here, our therapist has instructed us not to talk to them about any of this. She said we need to keep this private if we want a chance to succeed and that this would not be a healthy conversation. I just want to get thru this weekend without anything weird happening and I’m really nervous. Does anyone have advice or an experience they can share? 

TLDR: same as title, couple coming to visit that knew about at least one example of husband cheating and looking for advice"
55,"My (36F) wife and I (37M) of 11 years are sexually opposed, she suggests an open relationship and I'm not sure I can do it but we can't see alternatives.


Throw away account because friends know my main account. Wife is encouraging me to do this, she will be reading it all and if need be please address her with any advice directly in comments or I will ask her if she is comfortable with PMs to her lurker account and PMs to this account won't be read by her, I'll add her lurker account to an edit once I get permission, she will be home in 2 hours. 

We have 3 kids 7/9/10, we've had some serious hard times and been through it together no problem and we have a great relationship all round with 1 exception, sex. 

I've always been an adventurous and curious type and it seems like that ship has sailed for Wife. She makes jokes that she is beige but happy to be. She says she has never been adventurous or curious and that has been reflected throughout our relationship, previous partners for her have been about the same. I, on the other hand had experienced some adventurous times and when I met Wife, love got the best of me and I put all that behind me. Outside of the bedroom we fit nicely. Emphasis on that last sentence.

Years and 3 kids pass and it's time for me to get a vasectomy so we can get busy without any more kids, things were vanilla but regular, that was 5 years ago. At the same time exactly as the vasectomy my libido goes nuts. You see, you have to self love appropriately for at least 60 days or so and so I did, a lot. It would be safe to say my increased libido was double 3 months later. So I wanted sex and lots of it. Wife did what she could, at times, to keep up but for years, could take it or leave it and in the latter, more and more started to leave it. Slowly over the next few years all of the adventurous side of me came back and wanted seeing to. Many conversations were had with a few results at first but it started to become unsynced again and this cycle repeated for years. We made a seemingly suitable schedule that was daunting for her at times and underwhelming for me in others. We both wanted to reach a compromise on things and by-jingo we tried.

On a fed up day after too many drinks I sort of broke down, I had so much resentment built up and let fly with it all and being the understanding woman she is, she listened. I laid out all of the kinks I want to try and all of the sexual frustration I had, a lot of which she has no interest in, some she is almost disgusted by(its still tame stuff really) and the vanilla sex she wants is lacking for me, I want more. Now we are back in this unsynced cycle again. The things she thinks are on the kinkier side of what we do are still vanilla. We both feel guilty for not being each others preferred lover and Wife says she is completely satisfied on her side. The communication lines are way open this time and have been for a while. Wife, in beautiful heart, is suggesting an open relationship so I can get what I need and I'm just not sure I can do it or even get it. I have trust issues from every other partner in my life cheating on me(6 total) and my mum cheating on my dad which lead to very bad times as a teenager. Please help? If it matters to anyone, we are both the same size and weight as when we met, age has treated us reasonably.

 TLDR; Wife is vanilla, I'm adventurous. Wife has lower libido, I have high libido. We both communicate well now and want to be together. She wants to let me see other people and I am the one with the problem with that but I have trouble with the slower vanilla sex life."
56,"[Update] My [27F] girlfriend [25F] lied to me about a specific ex when we first started dating. I asked her not to speak to the ex anymore, and her family and friends think I'm being controlling whereas my family and friends think she's shitty and I should leave. Can't tell who is right or wrong.


Here is the OP (Corrected her age in the title this time): https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/boy987/my_27f_girlfriend_24f_lied_to_me_about_a_specific/

This is probably not going to be the update anyone wants to hear, based on the responses from the OP.

I spent all the last week in a daze and really angry but sad. We got into multiple arguments about it over and over. She feels bad about lying but still think it's controlling for me to ask her to not be friends with someone. I knew it was being emboldened by people in her life who probably don't have the full story.

Kind of in the same way I was being emboldened by the people in my life. My friends and I all have had bad experiences in the past with being cheated on in really horrible ways. The second any of our partners do something fishy we all get up in arms.

I called my oldest sister for some neutral grounding. She's a therapist and knows me/has met girlfriend and I wanted to tell her how bad of a week I'd had.

She kind of gave me a reality check.

She said based on everything she thinks girlfriend is telling the truth, and while she shouldn't have lied it *was* long enough ago that she probably has changed, like girlfriend is claiming. She said that because girlfriend has never had a serious relationship she probably didn't think hiding something that would upset someone as anything out of the ordinary, but now she does.

She said what my girlfriend said (girlfriend said I'm reacting like she's cheated when she hasn't) and that I'm reacting poorly to it because of things that happened in the past. I'm associating her hiding this friendship from me to a relationship I was in before for 5 years and was cheated on, and found out she was sexting and hiding things from me for the whole relationship.

She said we both needed to change some of our behaviors and that she likes girlfriend and thinks our relationship is good and if I keep trying to control situations like this and being unforgiving then I'm going to screw up what has been a good relationship.

So I spoke to girlfriend after some self reflection. At first it didn't go so well, because she assumed I was just about to start another fight like I had been all week. But once we got past that we got into the deeper issues. I said she needed to stop using lying to avoid situations she perceives as uncomfortable. I admitted I was treating her like she cheated, and my reaction was poor. I said I was sorry for up and leaving both times I got upset instead of staying and trying to work things out. She obviously apologized over and over for lying, which she had already done a lot since the fight.

I told her that we both created a divide in self preservation, I got mad and wanted out and demonized her, and she lied to keep me separate from dumb things she did at the start of our relationship.

In the end I didn't want to be controlling. That's not who I am as a person. The compromise we agreed to was, that friendship needs to be put on hold *for now*. Until I can trust her after the lying, I can't make myself vulnerable like that. And I'm only going to trust her if she can prove she isn't going to lie to me in every difficult situation.

And that's where we're at. I feel better now that we've reached a resolution. I know I might be told I'm an idiot, but I said in my last post too I genuinely don't think she's cheated. I'm willing to work on this to save the relationship because she's my best friend and I don't want to lose her right now. Not when I think things can get a lot better. And now that I'm working on not dragging around my paranoia, and she's ideally going to work on not hiding things from me, there won't be things boiling under the surface waiting to spill over.

Maybe it's stupid. Maybe it's not. I guess I won't know until the relationship ends, either from a break up or death ha.

**TL;DR: Am trying to see things from girlfriend's perspective. Have warped view of situations due to the past. Talking to sister advocated both sides but came to conclusion that the relationship was good but we both needed to fix ourselves. Girlfriend agreed to putting friendship with ex on hold to focus on our relationship, and eventually if I can trust her I don't care if they're friends. That's it I guess.**"
57,"I (23F) can't forget what my bf (21) said in his sleep and it is tearing us apart.


My bf and i have been together for a year and a half. About a year ago, I was sleeping next to my boyfriend in his bed when I awoke to him sleep talking. He started by moaning the name of another woman(23). A woman that we both know. Then he did it a second time. I was wide awake listening to him, in complete shock, my stomach turning. Then he grabbed my hips (I was in little spoon position) thrusted his groin into my behind and said a phrase that still haunts me. ""You make me want to cum *her name"". I woke him up and he was in shock, he really freaked out- he got up and left the room, almost cried, buried his head in his hands, got so worked up that I had to calm him down. We eventually fell back asleep - I woke up early because I was leaving for a trip. I woke him up to say goodbye and right before I left (he was still groggy) he said ""I love you *her name"" to my face with his eyes open. My heart was broken but I learned to move past it. I accepted that it was just a silly dream and at the worst it meant he had a crush on his friend. 

Fast forward to now, they work together as musicians (she asked for him to join her band) late nights, sometimes him not coming back until 3 or 4 in the morning drunk or high. They go on trips together with the band, soon they are planning to go on tour in Europe. I have had to grow so much as a person to not let jealousy eat me alive. I have nurtured a respect for the girl and I have never been cold or bitter to her, in fact I actively look up to her and always say hello when I see her. I thought that things were finally fading away but then something happened last night that has put my entire relationship into question. 

My bf and I, the girl, and some mutual friends were at a bar drinking, having a good time, when my boyfriend accidentally calls me the wrong name, her name. It wasn't a big deal, he apologized immediately but it stung. Later that night we ended up at a party and I was listening to some friends play the guitar when my bf walked outside. No biggie, he was probably out for a cig. I go out to look for him and hes gone. Who else is gone with him? Of course it is her. When I realize that they have both left the party together I want to cry. I want to go home that moment. I was in pain but I kept it together throughout my friends asking me where they were. I could have gone walking through the neighborhood to find them but I chose not to. Hopefully you guys will understand why. They end up being gone for something like 30-45 minutes. He comes back, I hug the girl goodbye and we both leave the party. 

I won't go into detail about the argument that ensued but I told him how upset that it made me to realize he was gone with her. How I couldn't forget what he had said about her in his sleep, how I felt like he was hiding something from me that was coming out in his concious and subconscious speech. He told me that his behavior was no different than ways I have acted with his friends. He told me that because I laughed when a male friend of ours tickled me that meant that I was attracted to him (I'm not.) He told me that no one understands him and that he was disappointed that I wasn't the one who left the party to go find him. He told me that yes, he did like her ""i had never met anyone like her, just like I had never met someone like you"" We went to sleep next to each other but we were worlds apart. 

Reddit, I realize that this pain will never go away. As long as they continue to work together I will always wonder, I will always compare myself to her. I feel at this point it is only a matter of time before something happens between them. I would never ask him to quit his band or sever his relationship with her. But I dont know if I can stick by him, it's so painful. He is in full damage-control mode, writing me poems, telling me he wants to fix this so badly. I have told him I want some space.

Am I overreacting? Is there something I can do? Should I cut my losses and move on? I love him so much, my heart is hurting. Thank you for reading.

Tldr: my boyfriend admitted in his sleep that he is attracted to another woman, they continue to grow closer, i feel it is only a matter of time before something happens between them, what do I do?"
58,"How to deal with my (30f) in-laws' (60s) dirty house and infant.


TL;DR My in-law's home is dirty beyond repair and I am concerned about bringing my baby to visit.

My husband and I have been married for 6 years and just had a baby 2 months ago. The homes of his parents and grandparents are dirty to the point where I am uncomfortable to be in them. This is dirty that cleaning cannot fix. Carpets are more than 30 years old and have been through multiple pets, linoleum peeling up and rotting sub-flooring is visible. The air coming out of the heating and air conditioning vents stinks. 

The grandparents home is far worse. Cats run wild and I am unable to enter the home without gagging from the stench. I have found fossilized and fresh cat feces in both houses. 

No one in the family wants to address or do anything about the issue. My husband and I have cleaned when we visit, but as I said, there needs to be interventions beyond cleaning, and significant repair is needed. 

I am asking for advice of how to address my concerns of bringing my infant to visit. I do not want her in these conditions but my husband won't address it with his family and thinks it will be fine because someone will be holding her the entire time and she won't come into contact with the filth. I am concerned about the air quality in the homes, as there is a stench. I am concerned about mold, THICK dust and cobwebs, and the cat feces. 

Meeting in another location is not an option due to mobility issues and living in a very isolated area. Also, husband and I do not live close enough for us to help with projects. We visit on long weekends and major holidays. 

How do I navigate this situation without offending anyone?"
59,"I [16m] jokingly jump scared my sister [16f] like we usually do, and she cried and hit me. I'm confused and she doesn't want to talk.


My sister and I frequently jump scare each other as jokes. Never in dangerous ways and we never do it when we are asleep or anything like that. It's mostly when walking around and when watching movies and such.

For example, some weeks ago I was watching TV and she started changing the channel from the hallway with the older remote, she did it a few times and when I said ""what the…"" she jumped and scared me. We just laughed and that was that.

So about two hours ago she was using her phone on the couch and I sort of dived into the couch from behind and ended up upside down for a few seconds. She screamed and jumped up and said NO. I started laughing and she yelled ASSHOLE and started hitting me in the shoulders.

Then she started crying and hit me a few more times. I said, what is wrong with you, and she said, you are a f' asshole that's what and kept crying.

I tried talking to her again a few minutes ago in her room and she told me to go away.

So… what happened? That's exactly the sort of thing she does all the time and suddenly I'm an asshole and she can hit me and cuss me out just cuz?

Should I try talking to her again?

**tl;dr:** Sister and I often prank scare each other, in a pretty harmless way most of the time. I did it and she cried and insulted and hit me and doesn't want to talk about it. What should I do and why did she react like that?"
60,"My new boyfriend's (35m) family hates me (24f) for reasons that are out of my control, and that honestly came as a shock to me


I've known Jim for years as a friend, we do the same niche hobby. Even though he's a little older than me we became good friends. 

From the beginning of our friendship, he was going through a divorce with his now ex-wife Camille. They separated on good terms, wanting things to be good for their kids, from what I heard. But the whole legal process just took time.

A while after the divorce was final, Jim and I started spending more time together. And i started to get feelings for him. I told him about my feelings about 4 months ago ,and he said he was interested in me too, perhaps romantically, but he wanted to talk things through first 

He and Camille didn't want to jump right into intense dating ,they wanted to give the kids more stability. So they agreed any new relationships would be introduced to the kids as ""dad's girlfriend"" or ""mom's boyfriend"" rather than having dates be taking on a role of ""new mom"" or ""new dad"". After all, the kids already had a mom and dad. 

I was cool with that, i didn't want to be a parent anyway, and I agreed it was healthier to avoid introducing new partners as parent figures anyway.

So from my perspective, the relationship was going great. We'd spend more time together when the kids were with Camille, and rarely hang out when Jim had the kids, or when they were at sports or activity. I let him keep track of the kids schedules, I'd mainly ask him about plans like ""hey I'm going out with my friend's / out camping / off on a weekend trip / out tonight... Wanna join?""

Sometimes he would and sometimes he couldn't because of the kids. But it was never a big deal when he was busy,,I enjoyed having time with just my friends anyway. And i like doing stuff like camping alone sometimes, it's chill.

The first time i realized something was wrong was when i met Jim's parents and sister for the first time and they seemed very cold to me. His sister Elle made some comments about me being selfish and a party girl, and his parents made some comments about how I'm awfully young and kept trying to ask me what kinds of experience with kids I had, whether I realized what dating a father meant, how I couldn't be doing what i please all the time, etc. 

I asked Jim later if they were always like that or if they had a bee in their bonnets for some reason today. And he said it was nothing, they were just overprotective of their grandchildren. 

So I told him that if they kept up that rudeness i wasn't interested in coming around their place anymore. And I thought that was that.

But last weekend, Elle (Jim's sister) asked me out to coffee one on one and I thought I might as well go, maybe she wanted to patch stuff up after that awkward dinner. 

Over coffee, Elle tore into me for taking Jim away from his kids too much, pushing him to push them into more sports and activities then they wanted so that he could go out drinking with me. Getting him to drop the kids off at their grandparents often so he could go on impulse vacation with me. Getting him to basically neglect them and not even spend a lot of time with them when he had custody for the weekend or week. She also accused me of being a home wrecker, who was involved with Jim way before the divorce was finalized. 

I'm the sort of person who doesn't care to get into a shouting match so I thought I'd sit and listen wait till she was done to get my words in. But she didn't give me much time to talk, every time I'd try to say something about how I didn't pay attention to the kids schedules and it was Jim who did all that, she'd get even more snippy with me. I ended up walking out after about half an hour 

I also have the impression that Jim's parents have the same opinion of me as Elle does. 

So I am stressed out. I don't know if Elle and Jim's mom and dad are right about him putting me before the kids, or if they're kinda overprotective. But I know they're wrong about it being my fault, if they've got a bone to pick with anyone it's Jim.

I hate conflict and I don't know how to patch stuff up here. Can I have some advice?

tldr My new boyfriend's family hates me for reasons that are a shock to me"
61,"My [37F] boyfriend [36M] ended relationship due to parental ultimatum.


TL;DR: He ended things because his S. Asian parents found out I had a son, gave him an ultimatum. Do I accept the outcome or is there hope?


My boyfriend and I had a phenomenal, fiercely loving, relationship. We shared passions, had good communication, and shared goals and values. I am educated, financially independent, share my boyfriend’s faith, and try my best to be a good person.  We were planning marriage.


On our first date I was honest and open about having a child. He was the first man I had allowed to meet my child- after a significant waiting period, knowing our plan was marriage, and him even meeting my child’s other parent to make sure everyone was comfortable.


He chose not to disclose this immediately to his parents. They had not had a good experience with an ex and he wanted to paint me in the best light. When he planned to tell them, things kept happening in which he didn’t want to add to their stress.


Fast forward to three weeks ago. His parents arrive in the US from South Asia, planning to establish residency. Things go exceptionally well. They want us to move forward with marriage and encourage it at multiple get to know you dinners.


We then disclose that I have a son and all hell breaks loose. They give him an ultimatum- he chooses me and they leave the country and have nothing to do with us. This means them going back to a politically and safety unstable country.


Two weeks pass and he tries to reason with them to no avail. He ended things with me Sunday night.  We’re both heart broken. 

The reason I’m posting here is to find out if anyone has ever seen parents come around? Should I truly let go, or do I fight? I love this man. I can’t imagine a better person to support and love for the rest of my life."
62,"My husband (27M) says I (25F) am not beautiful. Should I be worried?


First, a little info about me (25F) and my husband (27M). We have dated for 3 years and we have been married for a year and a half now. I consider myself to be pretty good-looking. I couldn’t be a cover girl, but I think I am beautiful. My husband is really handsome. I consider him to be the most handsome and attractive man in the world.

So last night my husband was showing me some photos on his phone, we were talking and laughing. When he was scrolling through his albums, there were few pictures of some really beautiful supermodels. I was a bit surprised (my husband’s interests never included models or fashion, he’s into tech and games), so I said “wow do you like them?” He became tense and said that it’s not a crime to have these images on his phone, he pointed out that I put pretty girls on my lock screen (I sometimes do put stylish photos of actresses and models on my lock screen). I said “sure they are beautiful”. I think he kind of felt that my answer was off, so he said the beauty doesn’t really matter. I asked what he meant by that. He said that beauty is important early in the relationships, but then you get to know person’s character and personality and this is what matters. I said that I agree, but I also think that it’s important to consider your partner attractive and beautiful. He said that even though I am not beautiful he still loves me very much. I was shocked at what just happened. I said “so do you think I am not beautiful”, he said that I know myself that I am not beautiful, but it’s not important to him as he loves me a lot, he loves my smell, my laugh... etc. so he tried to be really romantic about it. I started crying, he tried to comfort me but I was just too upset. He fell asleep holding my hand, and I cried through the night. It really hurt as I had no idea he didn’t find me beautiful or attractive. I cried today as well. We haven’t addressed the issue yet, to be honest I do not know what to say. Should I be worried that my husband does not find me beautiful? Or is it just me being shallow and vain, and I should just be thankful that he loves me? 

TL; DR  My husband of 1.5 years revealed that he doesn’t find me beautiful, and I am not sure if I should be ok with this."
63,"My (24F) boyfriend (27M) makes me feel horrible when I'm on my period.


I've always had really bad periods. Ever since I started them when I was a teen I would get bad moods and heavy periods.

When I met my boyfriend, we experimented with different contraception but it was suggested by multiple doctors and gynos that I go on the IUD.
I was warned the IUD would make my period worse but it was the best solution.

I've had it for a while now. My boyfriend and I have been together for 5 years.
And everytime month when my period comes around, he makes it his mission to be horrible.

About a week before I actually bleed, I get in ""funny"" moods where I feel sluggish and tired. I'm sure that is common for a lot of women.
But my boyfriend will complain at how I am ""always in a bad mood"" and he can't remember when I was in a good mood.

I tell him I'm due on and he rolls his eyes and says I'm ""always due on.""

It's like he doesn't know this happens every three weeks.

We've gotten in arguments because I don't satisfy him sexually enough on the week when I'm bleeding. 

I'm so frustrated and at a loss. Apart from this time he's wonderful and this doesn't happen every time but it happens more than not.

How do I deal with this?

Tldr. Boyfriend makes me me feel bad for my bad moods when I'm on my period."
64,"I [17m] told my sister [17f] she looked good in school and her friends mocked me and she joined. That made me feel bad and she didn't apologize later. What now?


Our parents are separated and we live with mom but we see dad most days and sometimes stay with him. I stayed with him on Sunday and we went to school separately. I didn't see her when I arrived.

During the break I saw her in the park. She was on a bench and in the bench in front of her 3 girls who I suppose are her friends (I had seen I think one of them before, but never with my sister). I approached her, said hello, she said hello, and I thought her hair looked pretty and told her it looked nice and asked her if she had done something in particular. 

Then one of the girls (they had been each on their phones before, I didn't realize they were even talking to my sister before I got there) said that was the gayest thing she had heard today and they all laughed. Then my sister said yeah, he says weird stuff like that from time to time and they laughed again. I felt pretty uncomfortable.

I thought oooohhkay? And decided to leave. They kept laughing.

At home I asked her what was that all about and she said it was just a joke. I told her it felt more like she was mocking me to seem ""cool"" and she said I was being too sensitive. I said, how am I even supposed to know it was joke if I have never spoken to them before, you say that sort of thing to a stranger and they're gonna assume you are making fun of them. Then she got angry and said don't you start with your ""logic-Asperger thing"", it was a joke, just laugh and get over it.

So that didn't work and it made more angry.

That was today in the morning but I still feel bad/angry about it. Should I talk to her again? I haven't talked about it with anyone because I don't know, seems like a dumb fight, but it still makes me feel bad. I actually cried a bit a few minutes ago about it, which doesn't happen often, or ever really, when we fight or, ever really. But I'm not gonna tell her, seems pointless.

Should I expect her to apologize? Am I actually being too sensitive/was I too sensitive back in the moment?

**tl;dr:** I told my sister her hair looked good and her apparent friends mocked me about it, said it was the gayest thing they heard that day. She joined them. I talked to her later and said it was a joke and to get over it. What should I do now? Why does it make me feel so bad and offended?"
65,"My (23F) dad (60M) is in the ICU. I’m flying home today. This might be the last bit of time I have with him. What do I do?


I’m numb right now so this might not come out right. 

My dad is my rock. He’s always got my back. He taught me sailing, and golf, and soccer. He introduced me to the Hobbit and Harry Potter. He’s travelled to awesome places with me. He sacrificed a lot so I could go to university and grad school and is always willing to do more. 

I found out my dad was in the hospital on Friday morning and that he’d been there for a few days. I then found out on Saturday that he was doing better and going home. Sunday morning (today) I woke up to a text from my aunt saying that my dad is in the ICU with a serious infection and the doctor said I need to come home because they’re not sure if he’ll make it. 

I live a 9.5 hour flight away, and the earliest I could fly out is this afternoon, so it’ll be almost a day before I get there. This has all been so sudden and I just feel like I’m going through the motions. I haven’t talked to him directly because he was doing so poorly, but my aunt read him my messages for me. 

I don’t know if my dads awake, or if he’ll be able to talk to me when I get there. I’m trying to stay positive and send good vibes, but also I work in healthcare law and know how things can go (the most recent inquest I had was for a woman who died after having one of the procedures my dad’s just had). How do I make it special when I get there? How do I keep his spirits up if I can and what do I need to do? If anyone has been through anything similar I’d love to hear your experiences. I’m just so lost. 

Tl;dr: my dad is in intensive care and might not make it. I’m flying home to see him. What do I do?"
66,"My [M,36] girlfriend [F,28] is regularly involved in social engagements led by a 'swooper' [M,40s] How do I handle that? Do I just let it be?


I've been dating my girlfriend for about 8 months, and there is a figure in her life who isn't super involved, but rubs me way the wrong way.

He is the leader of this church group her younger friend often invites her to every few weeks and is basically a textbook ""swooper."" You know that kind of ""wild zany, just such a nice guy!"" type who seems peculiarly more interested in the prettier young women of the group than the young men. He can't help it. He isn't like other guys. He just gets along with women better. Such a sweet, fun-loving guy! A great friend (to women). A shoulder to cry on (for much younger women).

I notice in stories from the events and being in social situations with him that he has a way of getting my girlfriend (and other attractive young women) into 1-on-1 settings, ingratiating himself or 'negging' them with all that zany ""charm."" Like: ""Oh, how'd we get so for apart from the group (in this activity that ***I*** planned) let's see how long we can take to catch up to them!"" Just such a zany, sweet, unpredictable guy! Or ""I'm just a wacky guy, vaguely insulting much younger women and pressing into their physical space regardless of appropriateness.""

Which is weird because I get ice daggers from him, he hardly speaks with the other men in the group, he ignores unattractive women, and older women at a social gathering may as well not exist to him. Isn't that so weird?!

I *hate* this type of guy. Rather than look for a partner in the wide world, where he faces rejection, he basically preys on women in his immediate circle (mostly much younger and much more naive), waiting for them to be at their weakest. Like a demi-predator. Not even strong enough to be a ""threat,"" just a weasel.  You know his M.O.: Hover around several women regardless of whether they are in relationships or otherwise unavailable, and the second a weakness or distance pops up — maybe a few too many drinks, maybe a fight, maybe a long day working together on a demanding project, or an overnight trip completely out of normal context — and SWOOOP! There he is! But my girlfriend doesn't seem to have any warning bells going off whatsoever.

Is it my place to point out the ... peculiarities ... in his approach to social engagements? I don't want to suggest insecurities where there aren't any. I mean if she can be swooped by a guy like that, I have it coming. To me his underlying intentions are clear as day. She, however, doesn't seem very wise to it at all. A guy like that is always there — as a shoulder to cry on, a friend to confide in, just, whenever you need a hug. Right? Just a hug? Bring it in. Such hug.

How do I handle this? I feel uncomfortable around him and skeezed out, but don't want to come off insecure or jealous. I'm not really ""worried"" about my relationship, but surprised my girlfriend and her friends all seem so blind to it.

\-------

tl;dr My girlfriend regularly joins social engagements with a group led by a ""swooper"" but doesn't seem wise to his semi-predatory ways. Do I say something? Am I just being insecure?"
67,"My (22F) boyfriend (23M) keeps expecting me to pay for/do things for him and his friends/family. Am I overreacting?


So I just started officially dating this guy for two months now. Very fresh and we’ve been seeing each other multiple times a week. I am an unemployed student and he works full time. So far, I’ve paid for a lot of our dates and while I feel that I am a pretty generous person, it sucks. He has a lot of bills and rent to pay for, which I understand. I have some money saved up from working the previous year and still live at home. Furthermore, he kinda expects me to do/give/pay for things for his friends and family. They’re small acts but it does bother me. Besides me paying for dinners and such, here are some other examples: 


1) I bought a bunch of snacks from the grocery store. We get to his place and I’m only staying for a few hours so I only bring one snack in and say I’m leaving the rest in the car. He asks, “you’re not going to give some to (roommate’s name)?”  who I’ve only spoken to once or twice. 
2) He tells me to buy something for his roommates. I buy it. No big deal, less than $10. But never did he thank me or mention anything about paying me back. 
3) I’m selling extra concert tickets I have and he said his friends might want them. Asks me for how much they were and I tell him the exact amount I got it for, no less and no more. He asks “you’re not going to give them a discount?” 
4) He has expected me to buy his sister things. “(Sisters name) would like this” “you should get this for (sisters name)” 


There are a lot of other small examples of this and it bothers me so much. If he would ask in a polite manner and doesn’t expect me to do these things, I’d be happy to oblige. Am I overreacting? I was planning on talking to him about it soon but am afraid it would come off the wrong way. I’ve mentioned that he never says thank you for things in general and he said he’d work on that. I didn’t mention the friends and family thing yet. 
Thanks! 


(Tl;dr: boyfriend expects me to pay/do things for him and his friends/family without ever showing thanks or paying back)"
68,"My [F28] partner [M30] and I are having issues surrounding the shared use of my car. How much should he be contributing?


Apologies in advance if this is too long, I'm just trying to provide all relevant details, and thank you in advance for any advice or outsider perspectives.

&amp;#x200B;

Boyfriend and I have been together about 3.5 years, living together about 3. I got my car about 2.5 years ago. In the time that I've owned my car, my boyfriend who uses his motorcycle mostly for transportation, will borrow my car occasionally. When the weather is wet he uses it more, and when the weather is nice he uses it less. I am happy to let him do this sometimes, as I don't want him riding his bike in the rain, and I don't want him having to deal with the crappy public transit we have. He will usually add gas when he borrows the car. Other than that, he pays for no expenses related to the car.

&amp;#x200B;

I ride my bicycle to work most days, and take public transit when the weather doesn't allow biking because I have very few car parking options at my work. Sometimes boyfriend will take the car for longer trips on the weekend, more and more these are trips on which I can't go with him because I am working. In the past, however, I would usually go with. This has been a long winter, and he has used my car relatively frequently. I rarely use my car for more than trips to the grocery store these days.

&amp;#x200B;

When I first got the car, he offered to help pay for the car payment and use at his leisure. I didn't want to deal with disentangling this in the case that I sold the car or we broke up, so I said no thank you. I am, however, having regrets now that he has been borrowing my car so frequently lately. In addition to that, an incident occurred last weekend. I had to work, but he had to make a trip (about 30 miles each way), so he borrowed my car.

&amp;#x200B;

Apparently while my car was parked, someone hit the front bumper leaving a large dent, and many scratches. He did not notice as he approached the car from the rear. As he was driving on the highway, he turned on the wipers and saw a piece of paper (which he hadn't seen previously) fly away. When he got to his destination, he looked around the car and saw the damage.

&amp;#x200B;

Though I haven't taken my car in yet for an estimate, I know this will be a costly repair. My insurance has a deductible of $1000, and that is almost an entire paycheck for me. It's probably worth noting at this point that I make significantly less than him, and he's about to make more soon too because of a promotion. And I'm about to make less because I'm going to grad school.

&amp;#x200B;

This all culminated in an incident this morning/last night. He parked my car when he returned on Sunday in a spot, which has street cleaning today (Tuesday) 8-10am. I haven't moved my car since he used it. I work late (got home at 11ish last night), and noticed my car was in this spot. He was in bed and I asked him if he could move the car in the morning since he parked it there, and since I don't get to sleep until 1am. Today is my first day off after 6 consecutive work days, and I wanted to sleep in until about 10. He works at 9 am. He refused. So this morning I had to wake up at 7:30 to move my car from the spot where he parked it. I brought it to his attention today, and he said he didn't want to move it because the way I asked made it sound like I expected it from him. (I did.) He had to go to work so we couldn't have any sort of useful discussion, but he doesn't seem to think he should have been responsible for moving the car, and he didn't indicate that he thinks he should be paying any more than he currently does.

&amp;#x200B;

I got angry that he refused and it got me thinking that he doesn't contribute anything to this car except gas, which is almost negligible since it's a super gas efficient car. In addition, he is at fault for losing the note. If he hadn't taken my car and lost the note, maybe I would have seen it and the person at fault would be paying for this repair instead of me. Maybe not, but I will never know.

&amp;#x200B;

He uses this car, adding miles to the odometer, wear and tear to engine, tires, brakes, etc. while just adding gas. So I'm trying to get some outsider perspective. Should I be asking him to pay for part of the repair? Should I be asking him to pay more towards my car? Pay for parts of maintenance/repair of the car? What is the reasonable thing to ask here, and how can I get him to understand how it hurts me that I even have to ask these things?

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR I'm not feeling like my boyfriend is contributing enough to the use of my car, and I'm trying to understand how to convey this to him and get him to understand my point of view."
69,"I[21M] asked my study partner [19F] out for a meal? Is she letting me down gently?


A little background: Her and I study pretty frequently ( about once a week) and have done so for the past quarter, so we're in the acquaintance/friend stage but more on the acquaintance stage still. 

I'm not really sure if shes into me but I really like her, shes sweet, funny, smart and her smile cheers me up. I'm pretty sure she knows I have some feelings towards her since I've surprised her with starbucks and boba on two different occasions. She seems to think its funny/cute. I've never made more of a move than that though. 

School ends pretty soon (about 3 weeks) and I wont be seeing her for a very long time (maybe ever again?) , and I say that because she's going back home for summer and I dont think we'll ever run into each other again since we wont be in any same classes. I wanted to ask her in person but some stuff came up and I wasnt able to so I decided that I'd ask her to grab a bite to eat in a casual way and see how she would react to that, then next time I saw her I would formally ask her on a date. Well heres what happened:

So heres what went down? I[21M] asked her[19F]

""Hey do you wanna grab some tacos later today? I know a good place"", and a little less than 2 hours later she responds

""ooo for dinner?? i lowk dont like tacos aha ://"".

So I responded to her ""For real? Tacos are bomb af tho, haha that’s ok , maybe next time."". I'm not sure if she was letting me down gently or if she genuinely doesnt like tacos but I didnt wanna be that guy that cant take a hint. 

What should I think? She hasnt replied btw (its been 6 hours), idk if thats because the conversation naturally ended there or ...??

70,"Boyfriend [26M] of almost 1 year questions everything I [24F] say or do. He’s a total pedant and I’m at my wit’s end. How can I make him understand that his judgment is unwelcome?


Hi reddit


Where do I even begin? My BF will find any reason to nitpick or criticise anything that I do or say, even if there is nothing inherently wrong. We’ve had endless arguments almost everyday because he will find something to question, and it makes me feel like total crap, but he doesn’t care because he says “he’s just asking because he wants to know”. He will totally derail whatever conversation we are having to correct or clarify something, even if it’s irrelevant or has very little importance to the big picture, and he will refuse to move on until his questions are answered. He gets extremely angry if I do not answer to his liking. I try to answer his questions, but if it does not fit his logic or it doesn’t make sense to him, he doesn’t count it as an answer and he explodes in anger. 


For example, I mentioned at a group chat we were both in that my internet is down for maintenance, and I briefly mentioned that my internet doesn’t like Discord. He immediately pulls me aside to ask me why I even brought that up, because it’s irrelevant. I was just trying to make conversation, and that I was not trying to blame Discord for it. He was criticising me for even mentioning it because he thinks there is no connection between the two. He’s right, there isn’t, but I wasn’t trying to make a point out of it. I just added an extra excerpt. 


Another example is the time he blew up on me for “disrespecting him by not answering his question”. I was telling him a story about my work placement in high school, where I worked in retail. I was venting about how people throw clothes back onto a pile haphazardly. He disagreed with me, and thinks customers shouldn’t have to fold clothes back as neatly as the staff do. I said well they don’t need to fold it as neatly as we do, just put it back at the right place at the very least, because people just throw it. Now here’s the important part, he asks “so where do people throw it?” and my “mistake” here was replying with “it takes two seconds to fold a shirt and put it back”.  Reddit, he EXPLODES. Because I didn’t give him a location of “where to throw shirts in a store”, instead I said people should just fold it and put it back, he literally got so angry that I “ignored” his question, just stopped our conversation to pick on my answer. I got pretty annoyed too at this point because I think everything is pretty much common sense. Did I really need to tell him where people are throwing clothes around in a store? If you’ve been in a store, you’ve seen how people just leave clothes anywhere right? But he became so livid at me that we ended up arguing for hours and not speaking for a day.  He later tells me “he doesn’t shop at cheap stores where there’s piles of clothes around” okaaay... (which is a lie btw, we have shopped at cheaper clothes stores where everything isn’t so perfectly folded and stacked)


He says he’s like this because if at any point something doesn’t make sense to him, he has this impulse to “correct” it in his head, before moving on. And the worst part is, he’s unable to see any other point of view except for his own. So if you were telling him a story and you did something he would not have personally done himself, he will stop you to basically question your way of thinking. Even if this scenario happened years ago.  It’s so incredibly patronising and rude, but he doesn’t care nor realise it. He always justifies it by saying “I want to know why you did it”. Feels like he thinks he’s some kind of moral bastion sometimes, where he is the golden standard of what is right correct. He claims to do it because he just wants to “know” but he always follows up every question with “why didn’t you do x” or “why didn’t you say y” and I’m just so baffled why he’s doing this. 

I’m so totally worn out by his behaviour. Almost everyday we argue because he will find something to nitpick and I have become incredibly defensive to the point I just immediately get angry when I feel like he’s doing his “thing”. We end up arguing almost everyday. My own anger is becoming destructive but I’ve asked, pleaded, BEGGED him to see that what he does is hurtful. It makes me feel stupid, it makes me feel so little. I end up having to apologise profuse for almost everything I do just to satisfy him. 

TL;DR - boyfriend is incredibly pedantic and prone to nitpicking/criticism/casting judgement. It has lead to me becoming incredibly defensive and angry. I don’t know what else to do anymore."
71,"My mom [50F] can’t seem to accept that I’m an adult [22F] and that she has to loosen control. How do I fix this?


I’m 22 years old and just recently moved back in with my parents for the summer. I finished college and am starting law school in the fall, so when my parents offered to let me move back in rent-free for the summer to save money, I jumped on it. I had no idea it would get to be so frustrating, and I’ve been here a week. Since I got back, my mom has had a hard time giving up the control she used to have over me as a child. Every time I leave the house, she demands to know the address of where I’m going, who I will be with and when I will be home. If I come home later than I said I would, I have to text her or call her to let me know. She refuses to go to bed until I come home. 

My friends who are all my age think this is absolutely bananas. Their parents have long accepted that they have to withdraw a bit, and I thought mine had too, but I also have lived in another state the past four years. The tipping point came last Saturday. I went to a friend’s party, where all our old high school friends had a mini reunion. I was so tired from traveling 10 hours and the new time zone that I fell asleep around 1 am. My mom tried calling and texting me at around 3 am (meanwhile, I never told her if I would be home or when I would) and then somehow got the address and showed up in person to come get me. It was humiliating because she yelled at all of my friends and I felt like such a child. I understand she was worried, but I’ve known all these people for ages and can trust them. 

Since then, she’s been pouty and angry with me that I keep asserting my independence. I got a job this summer and am working late, so I texted my sister (18F) to bring me whatever we were having for dinner. My mom found out I texted my sister this and got upset because she thought I had gone somewhere, was avoiding coming home, and that I had texted my sister instead of her. I don’t know what to do. I feel like giving in to all of her demands for information will not help. I’m 22 and if not now, when will she back off? I tried talking to her, but she won’t listen. My dad has backed off an appropriate amount, so I don’t know what’s up with her. How do I talk to her?

TL;DR
My mom is being controlling even though I am an adult. I don’t know how to fix it because even though I tell her she needs to back off, she excuses her behavior by saying she “worries.” How can I fix this since I have to live here all summer?"
72,"Me [26M], my sister [24F] and our mother [55F] who abused her but treated me well. Need help with family drama


So growing up it was pretty clear that I was always my mother's favorite (she raised us as a single mom). At least I started noticing when I was maybe 6-8 years old, that she was always nice and kind to me - just like a normal good mom - but much more strict and cold towards my sister. To my shame for a long time I didn't really think much about it. Mom always called me the good kid and her the difficult one and I guess I just believed her. Me and my sister never had a chance to be close, also probably because she resented me for being treated so much better, which of course is totally understandable.

Well this continued into our youth and adulthood. I was always kind of a boring and normal kid tbh. Never caused any trouble, got consistently good (but not exceptional) grades, had nice proper friends. Then I continued on to study and got a 'proper' degree and work in a well paid stable job. Mom approved of all that, it was pretty much exactly what she wanted &amp; expected of me, so I got praise, presents and her love. My sister started to get a bit more rebellious in puberty, went through a goth phase, started to bomb in school etc, mostly just normal teenager shenanigans - which to mom meant she 'caused trouble' and all she ever got was punishments. Looking back I'm pretty sure my sis was depressed and struggling a lot. She was actually diagnosed with genius-level IQ as a young kid and so mom always expected exceptional things of her but she wasn't interested in becoming any sort of wonder child, which drove mom crazy. There was a lot of arguing between the two and me being a teenage guy I just stayed out of it and wanted it to end, yknow? But I do remember my sister could never do anything right to her, listened to the wrong music, had the wrong friends etc. To this day, mom thinks that my sister has failed in life although she is actually doing well for herself now, just living a bit of an alternative lifestyle that mom doesn't get and therefore it's wrong and horrible to her.

As adults, me and my sis actually became closer and eventually started speaking about our mom and the way she treated us differently. Sis said that growing up, she always felt like a disappointment and a bad child who just was 'worse' than me, which broke my heart. She actually barely has any contact to our mom nowadays because mom just wouldn't stop trying to change her into someone she isn't. As an adult she took a job that mom doesn't approve of, got a bunch of tattoos and looks kinda goth again, and basically just is everything mom hates.

I.. don't know how to feel about mom. I'm sick of her treating my sister worse. I look back on our childhoods now and just feel so conflicted because while she never treated me badly at all, she kinda abused my sister, and I did nothing, yknow? And it makes me feel like I should stop talking to her too, on principle. I offered to speak to mom about what she did wrong with my sister, but sis doesn't want me to, so I won't. Mom loves me and continues to tell me how great I'm doing and we have a great relationship on the outside but I can't stop feeling guilty and ashamed when I am around her, like the whole thing is a farce. How do I deal with all these adult realisations?

Throughout the 4 months, he became increasingly inappropriate. To give a little context: He constantly flirted with my female coworkers, (all being 18 - 25..) and I tried to brush it off. He'd constantly comment on my appearance, never pass me without grabbing my waste, rubbing my arm while talking, if I sat by him in the office, he rubbed my legs. Everything was ""babe, hun""  ""Why don't you smile more?"" ""You'll make more money if you wear heels."" At one point he said ""How's my favourite girl?"" I responded, ""Everyone is your favourite."" 

Eventually he asked for my number and honestly, I thought nothing of it, as we are supposed to be working in direct communication with each other. I've always had my bosses number.  Obviously - His texts became less about work, ""plans tonight?"" ""What you wearing tomorrow... gotta dress up"" ""you looked great"" etc. I'd continually ignore them. This would be followed with a ""you're really ignoring me huh?"" Or a ""Is your phone broken?"" Text. I should also probably mention: he never asked if I had a boyfriend, he never told me he was married. I only knew he was married by over hearing conversations, but he deliberately never brought her up. 

This continued. Fast forward to last week: me, Brian, the current manager who was training me, and the managers wife, were all meeting at the restaurant. After meeting, Brian offered to drive me home and I live barely 5 mins away. I usually take the subway. 

Upon dropping me off, he asked if he could come in. I kind of laughed, and was thrown off guard.... Obviously was uncomfortable, so I lied and said no, I had people coming over. He then leaned over to grab me for a kiss. I immediately backed up and asked what he was doing. He looked super confused, and I went,  ""Aren't you married!?"" He basically made a face that was like, *'and?'* ... I asked if he was in an open relationship... He said no.  This was too much for me; I basically said something like 'I have no idea what you're doing, or what you expected to happen here' and got out of the car. Honestly it's a blur. 😖😩

This was it. 

Didn't really know how to process this, and had the next day off. I got a text from him in the morning asking how my day was. Didn't respond. He started texting me saying how he  felt sick about it, how nobody could find out. I eventually said I was uncomfortable with the whole thing and no longer felt comfortable working together. To this he became increasingly aggressive saying, ""the only reason I even worked there was because of him, if I wasn't attractive I'd be useless."" 

He then called me some time during his shift - demanding I don't mention anything because ""I'd ruin his life"". To which I responded.... you're responsible for your own actions and needed to leave me alone. I then received a text saying: ""I have plenty of friends and cousins, and friends directly in the police force, and if you ever think of mentioning anything, at all. I will be contacting my friends."" Enough was enough. I sent all screenshots to the restaurant owners and contacted the police. 

Thankfully, throughout this they have been so supportive. They said they want to work with me on this situation, and find a resolution with me. For now Brian has been given a dismissal and mandatory counselling. We discussed different options; I'm not entirely sure what's best here. On one hand - if they fire him, he may do this somewhere else. On the other hand, if he stays, they'll be watching him to make sure he never does this again. The worst is, his wife has no idea everyone else knows. 😔

One but part of me also can't help but feel like there's so many talented people out there who would be much more deserving of his position, and more responsible with it. I think I'm a little overwhelmed and not sure what's best here. Curious what Reddit thinks 

**TLDR; Married boss hired me, wouldn't stop hitting on me, tried to make out with me in his car. Reported it to HR, and they asked what I want to do in this situation.** 😩"
74,"My(26M) GF(26F) of 9 months says she is beginning to see me as a 'younger brother' and I think she may break up with me soon. Is there anything I can do/say to salvage the situation?


  

To clarify re the 'younger brother' comment, my GF is only about 3 months older than me. However, she was born in 1992, and I in 1993, hence technically, she is 1 year older than me. 

&amp;#x200B;

Anyway, we have been together for 9 months so far. This is my first serious relationship, and her second. The first 7 months were absolutely amazing; I think it was the honeymoon period before deeper problems started to arise which resulted in her making that comment which basically crushed me mentally. 

&amp;#x200B;

To give some context, I work as a medical professional. She works in international relations, and both our jobs take up a lot of our time. However, I do have more spare time than her. In a sense, work follows her home, and she can get extremely busy during the periods leading up to the numerous conferences that she has to organize. At first, I didn't mind at all that she couldn't see me as often as I would've liked. However, tensions started to rise when I got irritated that she was not able to reply me as she was so busy prepping for her conference. We usually meet once a week; we didn't meet for 2 weeks because of this and she wasn't able to text back either. The day after the conference, we were supposed to go out, I was already annoyed, and she was late. I let my displeasure show. We had a long talk after that - after which she explained why she was unable to respond to my messages as that period was literally the busiest period of her life and she was late because she had a run-in with an unruly driver. To give everyone an idea of how busy she was, she slept about half an hour every day for 3 days. I apologized and thought that the matter was settled but didn't know the damage to the relationship had already been done. 

&amp;#x200B;

Over the course of the next few weeks, I began feeling extremely insecure that she was not able to meet me and text me as often. I guess I had an irrational fear that she was not putting as much effort into this relationship as she did with her previous one. She told me that she used to go out for daily dates with her ex as she was insecure and he was extremely clingy back then. I basically let that information fester in my head and wondered why she could not do that for me. Once again, I let my displeasure and passive-aggressive attitude show in our texts and our subsequent meetups. I told her how I honestly felt and she had to counsel and reassure me that the circumstances then and now were very different and now she has her priorities in life much more aligned. She used to be consumed by the relationship, but now she isn't prepared to let a relationship dictate her life. It was difficult for me to change my perspective; I think it required about 2-3 'sessions' of reassurance before I was able to overcome my irrational thinking. 

&amp;#x200B;

2 days ago, I got a long text from her saying she does not want to meet me for now and that she needs time to think about our future. On further probing, she admitted that she is beginning to see me more like a younger brother and less like a partner as she felt that all the counselling and guidance was basically a one way street. She then started to describe all the previous times over the course of our relationship where she felt annoyed but I was unaware/unable to address her concerns and she's always had to let the matters rest. In my defence, I was not aware that she was annoyed as she has never raised them as issues before. Examples include not being there for her when she was scared, for being passive aggressive in other instances when she had work commitments and was late to our meetups etc. But now she is using this to make blanket statements that I am unable to hold conversations with her regarding adult-related matters like finance, cars, credit cards etc, saying that she can't turn to me for counsel and guidance and that she is neither a coach nor an older sister. Ultimately, she feels that we are at two very different stages of life. 

&amp;#x200B;

I do think it is unfair for her to do this to me without giving me a chance to change. I think that everything was slowly piling up and my insecurities basically pushed it over the edge. I really do wish to salvage the relationship, but I fear it may be too late. As of now, she is saying that she needs time to think things over. 

&amp;#x200B;

I have tried multiple times to ask her over text to give me a chance to change, but she seems set on the fact that she will have to 'guide' me again and she does not want to keep doing that. Is there anything more I can say/do to improve the situation? 

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR Got really insecure, now gf thinks I'm not a suitable partner and is probably thinking about breaking up with me."
75,"My girlfriend [28F] wants kids; I [28M] want a vasectomy.


My girlfriend and I have been together for about two years. Both in our late twenties. We've been through a lot in that time; I pulled out of a severely depressed state, found a decent job, and she's made progress in her career, learned to drive, and our lives are meshing well. We live together, do pretty much everything together, and are planning to buy a house and get married soon. One issue, though, has become a source of tension between us, and I want to think carefully about it as we plan for the future.

Since the early stages of our romantic relationship, I've expressed a desire to not have children. I'm confident in this sentiment, after having thought about it for a few years. She has been agreeable and understanding when I've mentioned this, and I thought we were on the same page.

To secure a future without children, I had a consultatation with a urologist about having a vasectomy. I'm trying to take control of my life, in a way that I couldn't when I was really depressed. I understand that my perspective on children might change as I age, but have decided that I feel strongly enough about this now to make a permanent decision. Just as there is a risk that I have regrets later, there is also risk that an unintended pregnancy substantially changes the trajectory of my life. This is a decision I want to make now.

To my surprise, this upsets my girlfriend. Additionally, I think her reasons for being upset make this different from a simple case of incompatibility. When I ask \_why\_ she wants to have children, the reasons she gives are:

\-- Having children will bring me closer to my parents by creating common experience, and a need for assistance in raising them.

\-- Having children is expected and desired by my parents, who I want to make happy.

\-- Having children will secure my relationship with my partner.

\-- Having children will create someone to take care of me when I get old.

I think these are all true statements, but I don't think any are good reasons to have children. There are \_many\_ ways to create common experience with one's family, to develop a romantic partnership, and to invest in your quality of life as you age. We are fortunate enough to not live in an agrarian society where children are an economic necessity.

I'm a human being, I promise. If she had expressed a fundamental and intrinsic call to motherhood, or a general excitement about having kids around and being involved in their lives, I think those would be great reasons. Maybe not reasons mirrored by me, but ones that make sense. It is of course not my place to decide what constitutes adequate justification for having children generally, but I'm trying to learn about how my partner is thinking, reasoning, and feeling, and this is a decision that strongly impacts our joint future.

I've suggested that we leave open the possibility of adoption; there are many kids out there in need of a loving home and the resources we enjoy, especially older ones. This doesn't seem to satisfy her desire. We can't really compromise, since we can't have kids to a lesser extent than having them.

Can anyone here provide some insight or advice about how to proceed? She's great, and I would hate for this to drive us apart.

TL;DR: I don't think my girlfriend's reasons for wanting kids are good reasons to have kids. Am I an ass for thinking this? How do we move forward?"
76,"My GF(21F) of four years doesn’t know she crushed me (23M) inside. Telling her the truth might ruin everything.


First about me. When I was 13 I was abused for a year by a older guy (15).  My family is super religious and I was also starting to find my faith around this time so after the abuse had stopped I was really worried about telling my parents and felt guilty and disgusted with myself. I kept it to myself and I started having a lot of mental health issues when I turned 15 and had a few hospital stays because of it. Despite a lot of prying I still wouldn’t come clean to anyone about what happened. So I turn 17 and I’m starting to feel better about speaking up but still really apprehensive due to all the attention and people finding out. I decided to look up my abuser on Facebook only to find out he was never going to answer for anything. The previous year he was in a rollover with several other teens and died the next day. I was so numb after and really didn’t know how to feel anymore. I try my best to just move on. two years go by and at 19 as I’m getting ready to graduate I meet my GF. We’ve been happily together 4yrs now and I want to be with her for the rest of my life. Until the week before last  that is... her best friend is a psychology major and they got to talking about childhood trauma while I took refuge in the kitchen cooking . Her friend despite disagreeing victims become abusers stated she could still “never feel safe leaving a victim alone with a child.” To my horror my GF agreed with her. I had to run to the bathroom to quietly loose it. The woman I want to have a family with may not trust me with our future kids, I now am questioning if I’m wrong for not telling her about my childhood, even worse I’m a active Voluteer with my church’s preschool to 6th grade youth programs so I’m petrified that my secret will get out and people will not want me to volunteer anymore. We don’t live together full time and this is making it hard for me when we are together and when I’m home alone I overthink things and bawl my eyes out. I don’t know what to say but I figured I’d turn to strangers on Reddit to vent my torment.

TLDR: my GF(21F) doesn’t trust a victim of abuse which I am (23M) around children. Which I hoped to have with her one day. She also doesn’t know I’m a victim and for various reasons I’m scared to tell her."
