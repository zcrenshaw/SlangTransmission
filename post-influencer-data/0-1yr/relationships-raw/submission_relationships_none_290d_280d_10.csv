0,"I [19] developed a crush on a guy with special needs


There's a guy in my judo class that has eyesight &amp; hearing deficiency. I usually guide him during practice and he's quite friendly. I can't help falling in love with him because I adore when he asks me for help and how innocent he is. It's actually the first time I don't like someone for their looks (although he looks pretty fine). 

How can I make a move on this guy? He is usually with his mother or aunt, waiting for him to finish the class and drive him home so this stops me somehow from talking to him after class. He's also a few years younger than me but I have always wished for a younger guy

Tl;dr need help with making a move on a guy (special needs)"
1,"My [25f] boyfriend [30-31m] broke up with me and moved to a different country. Can't get over it.


Title says it all. Been dating for a bit over 5 years before we broke up. Our relationship was great, he was a great guy, really loved him - he said he loved me too and I still believe he did. A few months ago he got offered a job in Shanghai, told me he wanted me to come with him, I told him that I couldn't because my family, my career, my friends and my whole life was there and I didn't want to leave everything, just because he was getting a high paying job. 

We argued about it, we talked about it, we moved on, it got brought back up, we talked about it some more, it was a really long process, but in the end, he came to my place, told me that he's really sorry and that he's hurt, but that he felt like he had to do it and didn't want to live the rest of his life thinking about it, or realizing at some point in 20 years that he's bitter at me for not doing it and that he didn't want to hold me back or ruin my life or put me through anything just because he was being selfish.

So we ended it, amicably. Before he left, we kept messaging each other and talking about it and it felt like he was going to change his mind up until the last minute. Even when he messaged me that the plane, I felt like he was going to call me any second and tell me that he's changed his mind, but he obviously didn't.

It's been a few months now and I can't get over it. We spoke a few times, he told me about his job, showed me his new place, we message each other from time to time, but I feel so hurt that I can't even move on. I don't know what to do. Did I make a mistake? How do I get over it? I feel like I love him so much and that I have lost a huge part of my life and it kind of all seems pointless without him. I started feeling a bit better recently, but then it was his birthday and I just messaged him ""Happy birthday, I miss you, hope you have a good one :)"" And all he messaged back to me was ""Thanks :)"" And it just felt so cold and awkward that I started crying. I started to get over it and thinking to myself ""He doesn't care, why should I?"" And then one of my friends (Who speaks to him regularly and has actually been to Shanghai to visit him) said that I came up in conversation (This was on his Birthday) and he just started crying really hard and saying how bad he feels. And after hearing that, I started feeling bad again and missing him and I just don't know what to do. Help.

&amp;#x200B;

**tl;dr** Boyfriend of 5 years broke up with me and moved to Shanghai for an amazing career opportunity. I feel extremely sad and I can't get over him."
2,"I [22F] feel that my boyfriend [27M] doesn’t love me anymore. I think about leaving him often, but am unsure. I still love him, but he is mean to me.


I’m sorry if this is long. 

We have been together for almost three years, but I think I have been in denial about how badly he has been treating me for this past year.

He was very sweet to me when we first got together. He moved in with me last year. We were happy and very much in love. I have had other boyfriends, but he is the first one I was in love with.

I knew he liked to drink. I didn’t realize he was an alcoholic until he moved in with me.  We have talked about it a lot. He knows it’s not normal or okay. He’s promised over and over he is going to change and get it under control, but they are empty promises. Every time I feel like he is finally making progress, he disappoints me. He doesn’t even try anymore. He spends a lot of money on beer and weed and then complains that he doesn’t have any money.

I also didn’t see the side of him that can’t control his temper. Sometimes I’m afraid to even speak to him because I’m always walking on eggshells. I never know what is going to set him off. I grew up with an abusive father who was always angry and mean. More and more he is beginning to behave like my father, who I stopped speaking to for a reason.

We work together and live together, but spend most of our time not speaking to each other. He says he doesn’t have anything to talk about,  but will find anything to talk about with our coworkers. If I try to talk to him he usually just gives me short answers and says he doesn’t want to talk. At home we both are either playing video games or watching TV. If I try to sit by him and spend some time with him he says I’m annoying him.

Last week is really the straw that broke the camel’s back. While I was undressing he said, “God must have been pissed off at someone when he created your body.”

That is the meanest thing anyone has ever said to me in my entire life. I cried all night. Then I forgave him because I thought I was overreacting and being too sensitive. But now I realize I have been in denial and making excuses for him for the last year.

Despite all of this, I love him with all of my heart. But I can’t live like this anymore. I’m not happy. I know I deserve better.

However, I can’t make up my mind. I think about breaking up with him every day. But I end up wondering if I will be happier alone or if I should just stick it out and hope things get better. He used to love me. We used to be happy.

It feels like he doesn’t care about me anymore and that he is only with me because I live close to work and I have nice things he likes to use. Cars I let him drive because he doesn’t want to buy one. A big TV and a PS4. Because he lives with me and doesn’t have a car, he has become dependent on me. This makes me feel guilty when I think about breaking up with him. I don’t want him to lose his job.

TL;DR: I feel that my boyfriend doesn’t love me anymore and is only with me out of convenience. We used to be happy but now he treats me badly. I think about leaving him often, but am unsure. I still love him."
3,"I (17M) have been talking to two best friends (16F) &amp; (16F) and don’t know what to do.


To start off, I never meant for this to happen but I was told by Girl1 that she wanted to stay friends after I explained how I felt about her so I started hanging out with Girl2 and recently Girl1 made a move on me and I slept with her and as far as I know of, neither of them have told each other and I know everything is going to fall apart soon and I don’t want to hurt either of them. What do I do?

TLDR: Liked 1 girl, she didn’t like me back so I talked to her best friend. Girl1 made a move on me and now both like me (I think?) Wanting out of scenario but want to keep one relationship "
4,"I’m [24M] going on a trip with my friend [27F] at New Year‘s and don’t know how to read the situation. Call it off or go through with it?


So we’ve been friends and have had drunken fumbling and flirting, but we‘ve done everything but have sex.  We’ve never traveled more than a couple hours along and now we’d be traveling and staying together for three days.

We both have some feelings for each other and have said to each other that we both care about each other, but she giggles like school child when we talk about sex, and blushes.  I don’t get it because she’s very sexual and likes to catch people off guard with sexual remarks.

But we’re going on a romantic weekend trip having not talked about anything.

I talked to a female friend with more experience and she said I should just go and have fun, and have more fun if anything happens.

I had planned on going or just telling her I made a mistake by agreeing to go, and that this is a trip I’d rather go on with an SO. 

She came out on a limb asking me it whatever capacity she was asking me (friend or lover) but I don’t know what i should do.  I do love her, and see her being in my life for a long time.

TL;DR: Planned a mutual trip with my female friend (we’ve never defined things and have had confusing moments) and am having second thoughts.  Should I just and make it a super memorable trip or call it off? "
5,"Boyfriend (30M) Called Me (29F) Names Over Gingerbread House


I bought our very first gingerbread house kit and since I recently just moved to his country I was extremely excited and when I get excited I tend to take over so I was there icing the walls and stuff and then a few minutes later I handed the icing to him. 

We were happily decorating the house when he started drumming on the table while I was decorating my side of the roof and the house fell apart, he asked if it was his fault and I was “I think so because of the vibration of the table” 

We started to put it back together and I was doing it more so he said “You really like taking over things and you give them to me when you can’t anymore” 

I stayed silent, then he started saying things like “Even poor people won’t buy this shit.” “This is the most stupid thing ever” so I was hurt because I wanted to make it our tradition that we make a gingerbread house but now I hate it.

I ended up keeping it in the fridge and then he got mad and went as far as saying we’re over and that he’s done with my ugly ass.
(he tends to go after my insecurities when he gets mad at me)

TL;DR: boyfriend got mad while we were making a gingerbread house and started calling me names. I dont know what to do because all i wanted was to make a tradition. "
6,"I [20M] found out that my girlfriend [19F] was hit by a car and is now comatose.


We've been in a relationship for a little over 3 months and things were going smoothly until around a month ago. We live around 100 miles apart, so there is some distance between us. At first, I thought she'd ghosted me or something, so I was asking some of her family (who I was friends with) if she was doing ok and that she was getting better after she'd had a run in with some bad people over some drug issues (which I know is a huge red flag) but I assumed she was just a little shaken up so I gave her some space. A month later and I still hadn't heard from her, so I asked her cousin what was going on, which is when I was told that my girlfriend was dying. 

Her cousin was irate when she told me about what had happened, shouting about how I should know about this kind of stuff, how I should have been there and whatnot, and it wasn't until another cousin of hers started trying to comfort me that I found out she was actually in a coma. I want to visit her but I don't know where she is, and her cousin (who is definitely not fond of me to say the least) said she'd tell everyone that I'm not good for her.

I was heavily considering ending things between us before I found out what had happened, with the abuse from her cousin and the lack of communication between us. But now I feel trapped here. I want to leave for my own wellbeing, but I'd feel awful about leaving her now. I don't know if it's better to just move on or put up with the abuse from her cousin and waiting to see how things turn out.

My friends who don't know my girlfriend almost unanimously agree that something is fishy about all of this, but my girlfriend's friends and family think I'm being selfish for wanting to know what's actually happening.

TL;DR: Girlfriend disappeared, her cousin shouts at me and tells me she got hit by a car, now I'm not happy in this relationship but I'd feel awful for leaving."
7,"Should I [21M] ask my female friend [22M] tonight if she has feelings for me tonight?


We met through Facebook 2 months ago: I messaged her asking for tips on how to ask this other girl out, she gave me tips, then one day I was heading out to dinner and asked if she wants to join if she's on campus. We became very good friends since then and we spent time together every week doing fun things. 


Last week, we went to the city with her friends and hit up some pubs, a club amongst other things. In the pub, her friend and her spent a while in the washroom, then the friend came out first asking me if I have feelings for her. I said no and then she came a bit after. 


The next day, she had a date with a dude and she said he is very nice. I said ""Nicer than me? No way!"" as a joke and she said no that's different. Then she proceeded to ask me if I was jealous, then she asked me it again later. 


Tonight, she asked if I want to play a sport and I said yes. We usually go for walks after we grab dinner, and I was wondering if I should ask her if she has feelings for me tonight.


Some advice would be appreciated. Thanks.


TL;DR: 21M wonders if his 22F friend is into him because she did some..... unconventional things lately."
8,"I [21F] don’t know how people keep relationships alive and interesting.


I know it’s probably because I’ve not met the right person yet, but I really find myself getting bored of the other person after a year or so.   I feel like the feeling is mutual, even though in my past relationships we always did fun things, sex life was good, etc.  Just feels like the love and interest goes stagnant.  It just makes me lose complete faith in relationships.  I just dunno if I believe in the whole soulmates and one person for one person thing.  Confused.

**Do those of you who’ve been in long term relationships (5y+) still love your partner as much as you did when you first met and still find the relationship exciting?  Do you think the feeling is mutual?**

I know it’s a weird thing to ask, but I’m curious, and it’s been really bothering me and hindering my personal life a bit. 

**TL;DR** Do those of you in long term relationships still love your partner and find them as exciting as you did when you first met?"
9,"Is there something inherently wrong with my (24F) approach to dating?


So, I have a pretty practical approach when it comes to dating. On paper it makes a lot of sense, but in reality it isn't working very well for me. i get dates, a few here and there, sometimes second or third dates, but never relationships.

I have a career and hobbies that don't allow me to meet men regularly, so I'm on a couple dating sites. My profiles are fairly good, I'd say. People will message me and I'll message people. My suggestion for dates 95% of the time is coffee. I think coffee is one of the best ideas for a first date, especially if you're meeting someone for the first time. Usually happens in the daytime, doesn't take too much time, casual, and inexpensive. Things like dinners and movies really add up in terms of cost, and since dating is a number's game, I can't afford to go on expensive dates.

The men I've met have been nice. I usually end a date on a handshake. I'm not a hugger, especially if I've just met someone. In seems like too much too soon. Most men don't seem have an issue with a handshake and a warm verbal goodbye, but I'm wondering if this could be a problem since I don't often get calls back.

Is my dating strategy a good one, and I just haven't found the right person yet? Or should I be making changes? My friends have just sort of stumbled into relationships or are happily single/not trying to date, so they don't really know.

**tl;dr I prefer coffee dates and handshakes. Is this too 'cold' of a dating strategy?**

10,"Mother and expecting another, but significant other was unfaithful. What do I do?


Quite long, so be prepared for some reading. I really don’t have many friends of my own so I’m asking for advice but also using this post to sort of clear my mind and get it all off my chest. Starting with just a little background information so you can understand our relationship and the situation a little better. 

My boyfriend (27M) and I (25F) have been together almost 7 years now, we have a 3 year old together and I’m currently 8 months pregnant. We have two cars we share legally, he pays one payment / insurance and drives that vehicle and I pay the payment / insurance and drive the other. We rent a house together although no official lease was signed so although technically the house “belongs to us both” he is the breadwinner and has always paid rent and the electric. We both work full time but he brings home almost double what I do, I pay for our groceries and my car but he pays for most everything else which is just what has worked out better for us.

On to the issue, we have had our problems in the past and have broken up before but it never lasted long. In November he went out drinking with a group of our friends and the next day I received a message from a women (who is also a mutual friend although we’re not very close with her, only seeing her a couple of times a year) that they had been intimate while out together. She said she didn’t know that we were expecting or that he and I were still together because we’re usually inseparable but because I can’t drink I decided to stay home with our toddler while he went out. She seemed like she was really hurt after finding out he wasn’t single and that she had interfered with our relationship but I informed her I held no hard feelings against her and didn’t blame her at all for not knowing because he should have made different choices and he knew better. 

Two days after the incident I told him I knew what had happened, he apologized and the conversation was basically done. I told him then again a few days later that I was really hurt and just unsure how to move forward and it again was swept under the rug and we’ve lived as if it hadn’t happened. He had stated it wasn’t that he left the house intending to cheat, but he rarely drinks and barely even remembers what happened.

It’s been a few weeks now and I’ve realized I’m growing to resent him. I don’t want to feel this way towards him and I think it’s partially because we didn’t really discuss the issue and find a solution, there was no real closure. He said he was disgusted by it and just wanted to forget it happened. I do believe that he loves me and we have made a good life for ourselves through the years so I don’t want to throw it all away, but I’m honestly not sure I can trust him. 

The more I sit in my thoughts the more I think about leaving but I have spent all of my adult life dependent on him and have never really been on my own. I have thought about applying for income based apartments but I don’t make very much money and am not sure how well I would do on my own. I am sure I could receive government food assistance and would have some help from my mom who lives nearby but the thought of uprooting everything with a toddler and soon to be newborn is terrifying. 

The bed we sleep in was his when we got together and he purchased the couch we have, plus most of the things we own. I did bring a tv and some smaller items into the relationship that I could take with me but I would basically be starting over all on my own empty handed. 

Although our breakups were ugly in the past I would hope we could separate on “good terms” and both be adults about the situation. I would like to think if I told him I wasn’t happy and didn’t think we could have a future together that he would understand and do what’s best for our children. I wouldn’t want to go to court and get child support in hopes that if I needed diapers or something for the baby and couldn’t afford it that he would be willing to help out, he does have a good heart and has always put our older child first and has been super excited about our baby so I am almost certain he would do what he could to help if I needed it. 

I suppose I’m just not sure what the best choice for myself and kids would be, he provides well for us and we had been happy for the most part but I’m heartbroken. The thought of starting over is terrifying and would be a long, difficult journey but would it be the right thing to do? I feel bad and don’t want to blindside him if I leave.. I’m stuck, half of me wants to stay and half of me wants to go. There would be pros and cons to either decision of course but I can’t figure out which would be better. If you were in my shoes, what would you do? "
11,"I (30F) just married my husband (35M) a few months ago after a very short relationship, and am now wondering if I’ve made a massive mistake.


[removed]"
12,"My roommate[19F] is very dirty and may be hitting on me[19F].


I am a sophomore in college living on campus, with the same roommate I had my freshman year. We were friends but things have gone south recently. Im struggling with bouts of depression and get tired of being around people and I don’t want to hang around her as much because of the following things:

She doesn’t see showering as a priority, maybe showers once every three days. She hasn’t vacuumed once this semester and hasn’t regularly cleaned any part of the room. From an outsider’s perspective and at first glance maybe the room would LOOK okay, but it is grimy on her side. I am a very neat person who values hygiene, and this has been causing me some annoyance this year. I even created a chore chart to encourage her to do more, but she hasn’t written anything in it since last month when I posted it and told her about it. There was one incident where since I had taken the trash out every time for the past three months, I waited to see if she would. A whole month went by before she emptied out this tiny trash can in the bathroom. She was evidently totally okay throwing trash on top of a mountainous pile that spilled out onto the floor. I realize this is very passive aggressive, but I need help on confrontation!

In addition to this, she has a boyfriend who comes over all the time. She cooks for him and they sit in the kitchen or watch something on the couch, like normal people. But he sleeps over maybe 4 out of 7 nights a week. And snores. So. Fucking. Loud. To the point where I don’t want to sleep in in the morning on weekends (and I barely get enough sleep as it is).

And particularly when he sleeps over and sometimes I spend the night somewhere else, I come back to the room and it smells like the worst human funk. I won’t explain it in detail but you get the picture—it smells like two warm bodies laying in their stank after fucking.

And here’s where it’s getting a little weird. My roommate is also bisexual, and beginning of our freshman year, when we both had boyfriends, we all went to a party and made out in exchange for our boyfriends making out. My boyfriend at the time warned me that she seemed a little too thirsty for me. I brushed it off thinking he was being paranoid or trying to mess with me. At another party again, with these boyfriends, she kissed me 3 times, according to my boyfriend of the time (I was drunk so my memory of events the next day was not the best). Since then she has continued to do weird stuff, such as always asking me to shotgun when we smoke, giving me extra long looks when I’m talking to her in the room wearing a shirt without a bra on, and being a little too inclusive of me with her boyfriend. For example, if I’m in the apartment, they tend to follow me to whatever room I’m in or butt into my conversations on the phone. I know my fears aren’t unfounded because my boyfriend is really good friends with her ex and her ex let him know that they were trying to fuck me during their relationship, and it was my roommate pushing for it the most.

I wanted to be her friend up until about a month ago, and maybe I let some of this weird behavior slide even though I shouldn’t have. Recently, I have been decidedly setting more boundaries and not hanging out as much. But is this a healthy living situation? I love my room so much and it was my idea to live in this residence hall, and I just feel like since I’m not the one causing trouble, why should i have to move out? I just need a sounding board for moving out, not moving out, or what other options could be.

TL;DR: My college roommate is relatively grimy in terms of being hygenic in our room and has actively tried to have sex with me in the past and may still be trying. What should I do?"
13,"My [23f] best friend [23f] took fake drugs thinking they were real, and has now changed completely


So my best friend Sarah and I met when we were teenagers in high school and have been best friends ever since. We have a great, healthy friendship with no major problems with each other at all. We still see each other regularly as we live in the same town.

&amp;#x200B;

We have both wanted to try LSD, but I sort of accepted that I never will because I don't have the right mind for it (too anxious, need to be in control of my mind etc.) but I love hearing peoples good trip stories. When Sarah told me that she wanted to do it, I said she should make sure that she's ready and that I wish I could do it with her. She assured me that she was and we joked that she'd change completely after one trip, which isn't so funny anymore.

&amp;#x200B;

So she was to take it with our friend Lou as she trusts him and knew he would make sure she was safe etc, but Lou and I spoke a couple days before this was all supposed to happen and he said that he was a little worried that she would react badly as she's quite an anxious person and has had depression for a long time. I said that she was an adult and if she wants to do it, she should, but then I got a text from her where she said that she just found out that her younger sister had slept with her ex-boyfriend and she was understandably very, very upset. I told her she needs to choose a better time before she takes acid because it's not something to mess around with and can screw you up for a long time if you're not in the right headspace. She maintained that LSD was exactly what she needed to overcome this (she can be very impulsive), and whenever Lou or I tried to suggest otherwise, she wouldn't hear it. 

&amp;#x200B;

She assured Lou that she was fine and ready, but Lou was not happy to take responsibility for her having a potentially nightmarish trip, so he had the idea to give her fake LSD instead. He'd told me that he'd done that before and had ""imagined"" some faint ""trippy"" things because of placebo effect. I didn't really want to involve myself any further at this point, so i just urged Sarah to reconsider but let her be. A couple days later, she went to the woods with Lou and took the fake LSD.

&amp;#x200B;

Ever since (this was 2 weeks ago now), she has changed completely. She now dresses completely differently and has gone from dressing like a Kardashian to Bob Dylan. She has replaced Ariana Grande with NEU!. She calls everyone ""bunny"" for some reason now and speaks very softly. She won't really say what she apparently ""experienced"", but just says that it was ""freakin' incredible."" I don't know if she's gone insane or if she actually took acid. Lou is just as shocked as me, but is 100% sure that he gave her literally a tiny square of water-soluble paper, and didn't even have any LSD with him. 

&amp;#x200B;

Do we tell her that it was fake? Do we let her do her thing? Do I encourage her to see a therapist? Help!

&amp;#x200B;

tl;dr my best friend thinks she took acid but it was just a bit of paper, and now she has changed completely and become ""spiritual"" 

&amp;#x200B;

P.S. if you don't agree with drug use, i'm sorry, but please don't shame her for wanting to do this. i'm aware that given her circumstances it was not bright of her to want to do this, but she did. i just need help on what to do next."
14,"M/21, Advice on Potentially Dating Someone W/ Cerbral Palsy?


Hey all. Throwaway here.

So I've been single for about a year now. My last/first relationship was an utter disaster of emotional chaos. My ex was physically attractive but that was all she had going for. She frankly became only worse of a person as the relationship went on. 

Anyways. I've been talking to a girl online for about two weeks now or so, both privately and in a chat room. We had some good common ground and we seemed to be getting it off well. I started hitting on her Friday evening. It was just teasing at first, but it escalated from there and we agreed to explore the possibility of dating. 

We've video called a bit, so I know she isn't a catfish. Obviously it's only been two days but given the total melodramatic shitfest the start of my relationship with my ex was, it's really refreshing this girl has been so mature about everything. She doesn't do drugs, she has her own goals, she's looking for a job, and she's been quite upfront with me. We've been talking about boundaries and what not. 

Today, though, I found out she has cerebral palsy. I had a hunch she had something of the like from our video call, of course. Still, I have never really considered dating someone physically disabled person before. It's a bit of a surprise in that sense. 

Of course, I'm open-minded about this sort of thing. After things with my ex...well, it doesn't sound half bad. But I also have no idea what to expect. My social/gen/posttrauma anxiety is a bit high about it, but it always is for a period whenever I start getting close to anyone. So it's par for the course in that sense. 

Anyways...tldr, any advice for someone seriously considering a relationship with a girl who has cerebral palsy? "
15,"Am I being unfair?


So I (26F) have been friends with a guy (30M) - let’s call him Jack- for a few years. When we met I was in a relationship - not a particularly good one &amp; Jack quickly became someone I relied on greatly as a friend. I always suspected he ‘liked’ me, but he never said anything or attempted to entice me even at the lowest points of my relationship so the subject didn’t much come up. 
I’ve since broken up with that boyfriend, who is struggling to let go, &amp; Jack has admitted that he’s ‘liked’ me from the start but not pushed for anything more. He’s still the closest friend I have, he’s always there for me &amp; we spend alot of time together. I’m comfortable with him, we will cuddle with a movie or go out to dinner without awkwardness. He’s genuinely lovely and in theory would be a great boyfriend, but the way my last relationship ended has shattered my ability to trust *anybody* for the moment meaning I’d rather be alone for a while. I think if i *did* manage to come around he’s someone I could be with long term, but herein lies my dilemma; 
I might not (come around). Is it unfair of me to keep him so close when I have no way of knowing if I’ll ever want more? Also, (maybe from a guys perspective) is it possible he’s mostly my friend because he’s into me?
So far I’ve never expressed any of this &amp; we’ve both kept it fairly neutral, but I’m starting to sense he might be gearing up to make a move/ say something, &amp; I’m not sure how to handle it. 

TL:DR Guy **likes** me, am worried is main reason he’s my friend, am also worried I’m inadvertently leading him on. "

17,"I [22F] am having a hard time getting over some things my boyfriend [29M] of two years said to me while he was drunk


My boyfriend has struggled with excessive drinking in the past. There was one incident before this in which he was drunk and paranoid about me sleeping with our roommate who is also my best friend [23M], but as soon as I told him that wasn’t the case and I would never cheat on him, he apologized and realized he was being an idiot. He completely quit drinking for a while after that. He didn’t drink at all for three months after that, and then very rarely for another three months. The past couple months, however, we’ve had a lot of events/family in town and he’s been drinking more again. I didn’t think it was reaching a bad point or anything though until this.

Anyway, for Thanksgiving my cousins were in town and we went out with them over the weekend along with my older sister [30F] and her husband [31M]. Everyone was drunk but none of us were shitfaced or anything. We had a really fun night, and my boyfriend and I walked home afterwards. When we got home he started heating up food for himself, and I asked if he would make me some, too, if I did the dishes in our sink in exchange. He got weird and defensive immediately, which I thought was strange, he said no, and when I asked why, he acted like I was trying to force him into something, or something, I don’t know, it was confusing. I was annoyed at his reaction but not like furious or anything. I kept doing the dishes, maybe I was giving off some passive aggressive energy, but I didn’t intend to because I really wasn’t that mad or anything. Then, he started talking to me again. He looked terrified. He said that he saw me change into a completely different person, that he had never seen this side of me before. I asked what he meant, at this point I was freaked out and confused, too, and he kept acting like I was like threatening him or something by asking that. He kept saying something along the lines of, “I’m drunk and you used that against me, you keep using little things against me,” and I have no idea what he was referring to. He kept saying I was scaring him. He said that he needed to talk to me about it in the morning because he couldn’t explain how I changed but that as soon as we came home I wasn’t the same person. I was pretty upset and kept asking him to tell me what happened. He started to, and then said “you’re acting just like your mother.” 

For context, my mother [59F] has been a severe alcoholic for my entire life and needs help. Earlier this day, my mom had called my sister and was completely wasted in the middle of the afternoon when other family was supposed to be going to their house, and my sister and I spent the rest of the day distressed over it, which my boyfriend was aware of. I was incredibly hurt that he would compare me to her. I have never had a drinking problem, but as my boyfriend and I have both experienced alcoholic parents, we have always agreed to communicate with one another if we get concerned. That is not what this was, though. 

I was livid, and this is the one point that I raised my voice during this incident. I basically just told him not to say that about me. Then I realized that me raising my voice wasn’t going to help, so I switched gears and tried to calm him down and get him to keep explaining. Everything was so confusing, I don’t know how these interactions went but I know he screamed at me at one point because it woke our roommate up. I knew that I wasn’t that drunk, but what he said scared me so much that in my head I thought, “Am I really fucked up to the point where I don’t realize anything that I’m doing right now?” so I went outside and called my sister, since she had just seen us like half an hour before this, and I asked if I was really that drunk and explained everything that happened. She told me no, that we were all kind of drunk but that I was behaving completely normally. She offered to call me a Lyft to her house, so I went inside to get some stuff. I was getting clothes and my boyfriend came in and asked what I was doing and I calmly explained to him multiple times, “I’m going to my sister’s house because I’m scared and confused and you said you couldn’t talk to me until tomorrow.” He was still upset, he was upset that I complained to my sister about him, and I tried again to calm him down and see if he wanted to explain how he was feeling, and he screamed “fuck you!” at me twice and told me to “get out of his office” (the office in our home is an area that we share). So I went outside to wait for the Lyft while on the phone with my sister again, he came out twice looking at me, same terrified look on his face, and when I tried to talk to him he ran inside without saying anything. The second time this happened, he locked the door when he went in, so I would have been locked out if I didn’t have my keys. Cool.

I went to my sisters house and slept there. In the morning he texted me, asking if we could talk. I called him to feel out the situation, and he was still insisting that something happened the night before where I changed. He told me I “wasn’t the person he fell in love with.” I asked him if he remembered yelling at me loudly enough to wake our roommate up, or if he remembered yelling “fuck you” at me twice. He said he didn’t, but also kept saying that he wasn’t that drunk. I told him that I was afraid he would lash out physically, because I was. To clarify, my boyfriend has never done or said anything specific to make me think that, it was just the emotional intensity and unpredictability of the situation. Even when you feel like you know your partner won’t, you never REALLY know, and that’s where my mind was. I told him what I thought happened the night before is that I got irritated, maybe was acting somewhat passive aggressive (which I apologized for) and it caused him to have a panic attack, resulting in everything else that happened. This would not be the first time he’s had a panic attack while drunk, but it’s the first time it’s been directed at me like this. I told him about how he got upset with me for talking to my sister, and he said it was because I was telling her lies, which I wasn’t. He said that he loved me and was afraid of losing me, and I told him that he would if he didn’t figure his shit out. During this phone call he did apologize, and he did already recognize that he needed to quit drinking, but it still wasn’t that productive of a conversation. 

I came home later and he asked if I was leaving him. I said no. He went to spend some time with his dad, who is a recovering alcoholic, sober for about 20 years. We eventually talked about it more later that day. He realized he was in the wrong, and apologized for the things he said, and said that he never wants to make me feel like that again. He said that I’m not like my mother and he regretted saying that. He admitted that he was thinking irrationally the night before, he said that he got paranoid and in his head he thought that I was trying to sabotage his whole life. He said that he’s going to start going to meetings and get sober. It was okay by the end of the night, we watched a movie together and were feeling better. 

It’s been a week since then, and things feel back to normal, except I keep randomly thinking about everything and feeling weird. For instance, we play fight a lot in our relationship, it’s always been our dynamic. But now when he says “fuck you” jokingly, I always remember the way he said it when he was serious. He’s always been a pessimist, but I’ve found myself getting increasingly irritated by his negativity, while before it was just something I accepted about him. Also, we’ve had issues with him having a hard time talking about money and budgeting, which is another issue that I won’t get into, but I’ve been feeling a lot less patient with him about it. Like, I ask him a question about planning our budget for the next month and he can never give me a straight answer because even one question stresses him out too much. Talking about money is another thing he’s working on and has improved on, but now I just feel resentful about it. I don’t want to feel like this, I truly think our relationship can continue to be good and healthy if he is sober, but I keep thinking back on everything. Him saying that I’m like my mother keeps echoing in my head, because I’m terrified of becoming her. 

Another thing that worries me is that in the aftermath of everything, he told me that he needs to be able to tell me when he needs to wait and talk about something in the morning and have me listen. He’s right, because in general when we have disagreements I have a hard time giving him space, and I can be really pushy because I just want things to get resolved, so I’m trying to be more conscious of that. However, with that particular incident, I think about what would have happened if I had just dropped it the first time he said we needed to talk about it in the morning. I’m afraid that he would have brought it up in the morning, and convinced me that I was the problem, and that I was too drunk to know what was happening, which wasn’t the case. In my mind, even if there was something he needed to talk to me about the next day, saying something like “you’re a completely different person and you’re scaring me,” and then refusing to explain further is already not the right way to go about it. 

I’m just still scared and confused about everything. Any advice would be welcome. 

TL;DR My boyfriend was drunk and said that I was like my alcoholic mother among other things. We made up and he’s getting sober but I’m having a hard time moving past the resentment and confusion. "
18,"My [23F] fiance [24M] pays for EVERYTHING and I feel like a burden. Together nearly 5 years


My fiance is the most loving and caring person I could ask for. He comes from a very wealthy family but became financially independent from them and now makes a lot of money as a NASA engineer. I don't have a job but I get disability every month because I have schizophrenia. 

I never wanted to combine finances until we are married, but when I got diagnosed with schizophrenia, he wanted to take care of me and it was the best option. i had to get a representative payee to take my disability checks and manage my money, and he was the only person who would/was able to do it as I come from a very toxic family and the only other person I'd ever trust with it is dead. He was happy to do this for me.

Since then, he pays for everything. He bought me a car and pays for my tuition at school. He buys all the groceries, rent, dog costs, I mean everything. 

I had a job for a couple months earlier this year but he refused to let me contribute. He said he wants me to keep my earned money because the disability money he receives for me covers ""my share"" and he uses it on rent and school. 

When I got diagnosed with schizophrenia is when he immediately asked me to move with him. I couldn't afford college, or a car, and was in a toxic environment at home. He said it was the best decision of his life and he doesn't want me to have to worry about it so much. Without him 100% would not be able to go to college at ALL. I'm a year away from finishing my degree in nursing, and have been excelling since going into partial remission with schizophrenia.

Every day I feel like such a burden that he has to do all this for me. He does it happily, but I always worry he might resent me. We aren't even married, it's not his obligation to take care of me, but he does because he wants me to have a good life. 

Once I graduate and become a nurse, I intend to pay off any student loans myself and become more able to financially contribute. 

How do I stop feeling like such a burden?

**tl;dr** fiance literally pays for everything, I feel bad about not contributing as much "

20,"I'm [24F] second-guessing breaking up with my ex [23M] of 6 months


I broke up with my now ex-boyfriend yesterday after we had gone on a road trip together and fought the whole time. The trip revealed things about him that I didn't like -- that he's incredibly immature, not easy-going, and gets mad when he doesn't get his way. By the end, everything he would do or say was on my nerves.

Anyways, I decided I didn't love him anymore (maybe didn't ever love him romantically) and after a series of long talks, I ended the relationship. What's hard is that I do really care about him and for all the things about him that I don't care for, there are really amazing aspects of his personality. I moved to a new city last year and didn't know very many people here, and he was by far my closest friend. I miss him and want to hang out with him now. I still feel like I made the right decision and that both of us deserve to be with people we love and who love us, but still, this is really hard. I've never been on this side of a break up before -- at least not at the end of a somewhat serious relationship -- and I don't know how to handle it.

Any words of reassurance or anecdotes are greatly appreciated! Thanks :)

TL;DR - Broke up with my boyfriend yesterday and feeling sad."
21,"Would I (M18/19) be a dick for flaking on a dinner with a friend (F17), who seems to have a crush on me?


So, like this saturday is my 19th birthday, and a few weeks I kind of promised to go get dinner with this girl, and I even promised to pay. Anyway,  we'll call her Christy and everyone says shehas a crush on me. Thing is, I don't like her. I asked her to get dinner in the heat of the moment, after we were on the phone because I was basically having a mental breakdown. I never wanted to spend my birthday with Christy, I want to go drinking or clubbing with friends. Especially since she has been acting mad jealous and possessive and shit. Thing is, I really don't want to go eat with her, and I'm wondering if it would make me a dick if I maybe kind of no-showed. I don't have the guts to cancel directly, so the only way I can get out now is to kind of slither away, and not show up. How bad is that of me, if I were to do this? I mean, I want to spend my birthday drinking with buddies, not eating with a girl that seems to have a one-sided crush on me.

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR I promised a girl that probably is crushing on me that I would pay for dinner, on my 19th birthday, and now I want to know how bad it would be if I flaked on her to go drinking with my mates instead, since I never really wanted to eat with her anyway"
22,"My[20/F] boyfriend [26/M] is going to another country for 2 months and I don't think our relationship will survive. Any advice?


We have been together for almost year and a half. We really love each other, share lots of interests, we often talk and plan about me moving in with him. Once he told me he is dreaming of having a family with me in the future.
A couple of months ago during the summer our ""honeymoon phase"" has ended. During a holiday he was texting with his ex, that is desperately trying to get him back. When I asked him who is he chatting with, he replied ""Oh, it's just my colleague ""A"""". The next day I confronted him, told him about my concerns, he admitted and apologised. 
Once he told me he was going straight home after work, specifically telling me we won't visit his friends at a bar. The next day I found out from his friend that he went to the bar. The issue here is not that he went to the bar, but that he lied. 

So since then I've lost some trust in my boyfriend. Every time something happens, I make a huge deal out of it, I start a fight. That made my boyfriend share less and less with me. I always expect something bad to happen, I expect him to cheat, to lie, to hide and I feel like if I don't confront him, I won't know the truth. We've both built defense mechanisms, gained some new insecurities.

There's another problem. Since summer, every time one of us is away, we argue and get mad at each other. Most of the cases it's me that starts the fight, sometimes it's him. Usually it's about some underlying issue or insecurities.  it starts with a normal conversation, but at one point we are arguing and asking each other questions like ""are you happy? Do you still want to fight for us?""

So, he's leaving for 2 months in spring for a study course. I can't stop thinking that if we can't make 2 weeks without a fight, how can we survive for 2 months, especially while away from each other? He keeps reassuring me that everything will be okay and we're gonna make it, but I don't think so.

TLDR: my boyfriend is leaving the country for 2 months, I don't think our relationship will survive, cause we constantly fight whenever one of us is away and we end up asking each other questions like ""do you still want to be with me?; are you happy?"""

24,"Introducing my girlfriend to my family


I’m expected to be home with my family to honor the holidays in about 2 weeks. My family is big on holiday celebrations, especially Christmas and they are really excited that I’ll be home, as I’ve been away in grad school pretty far away. I feel conflicted at the moment. I grew up in a big family (6 siblings). My parents are very loving, very kind to strangers and extended family and friends, but very hateful toward people of color, specifically Black people.

My girlfriend is Black...

Over the past 5+ years I’ve been with my partner, I have unlearned some pretty toxic and harmful things that I believed before because of my racist upbringing. My racial “preferences” for White women before my current partner were muddied with racist undertones (that I wouldn’t admit/wasn’t aware of), but meeting her has change my life completely. We went to the same college and I was very attracted to her from the moment I met her, but couldn’t tell her because I wasn’t supposed to be attracted to Black people. I eventually pursued her because I couldn’t deny the feelings I was developing and we’ve been together for nearly 6 years at this point. She’s my chosen family, my best friend and everything I could desire in a partner. I am close to her family and people in her life and I feel guilty because she hasn't engaged with my family at all.

My parents know I have a mystery partner and they really want her to come home with me for the holidays, but doing this would potentially ruin everything. It’s been soooo hard hiding my relationship for this long because I tell my family everything. They’ve asked for photos of us, but I’ve just told them she doesn’t like having her picture taken or being on camera. My girlfriend is just as nervous as I am to meet my family and I don’t want to put her in a situation where she feels disrespected. I would absolutely confront any racist remarks made by my family towards her or any person of color and this would make it seem like I was choosing her over my family. I love my family, my siblings are so great and my parents love us to death, but I don’t feel like I can exist in both worlds together and I don’t want to choose.

TL;DR: How do I balance being in a relationship with my girlfriend who happens to be Black and having a very racist family? Should I cancel Christmas this year?"
25,"My[22F] boyfriend [26M] wants to go to his brother's [33M] wedding, but I think it's financially irresponsible.


I'm gonna try to keep this as simple as possible... but I feel like money fights never are simple. My boyfriend's brother got legally married in early October and had no ceremony. Today, my boyfriend texted me saying that his mom wants to know if we are going to the wedding. I had never heard any mention of a wedding, so I ask for the details - it's in early January on a Wednesday at 1 pm. I say that's fine, I'll take the day off work.

He drops the bomb: the wedding is in Punta Cana. We have about 1 month before it happens. I say we can talk about it when he gets home (he's with his family right now), and he says his mom is willing to pitch in a little money toward our attending the wedding as our Christmas gifts. I say again that we can talk about it when he gets home.

Not that it really *really* matters, but this is his brother's second wedding. He was his brother's best man for his first wedding. Just for context.

We both get paid monthly. We have 2 paychecks coming up between now and the wedding - mine on the 15th and his on the 30th. Between the two of us, we make about $6,000 a month. Our monthly living expenses (not including things like buying new clothes, going out to eat, getting drinks, hair cuts that he gets monthly, money for activities with friends, etc) come out to $4,700, leaving $1,300 left over for those ""fun"" expenses, which we split. We have a joint bank account.

I just looked into things, and the whole trip (flights take about 6-8 hours depending on layovers, so this would be a 3 day trip) would cost us about $3,500. 

Considering his mom is paying for her family of 4 to go, I really doubt they would be able to fork over the additional $2,200 we wouldn't have - but even if she could, that would leave us literally $0 for the rest of January to do anything besides to to work or eat groceries, or even buy clothes for the wedding or a gift for the couple. So even if it's possible, I feel like it's irresponsible.

Things are already a little tense. I *know* he wants to go to his brother's wedding, and when I said we could talk about it when he gets home (rather than instantly saying yes) his response was short. We've been chatting a little bit since and things are tense. I get that it would be a bummer to not be there... but missing out on family being there is always a risk you take with a destination wedding, and I feel like his brother really should have given us more than 1 month's notice.

TL;DR boyfriend's brother is having a destination wedding and gave us one month's notice. While it might be possible for us to go (unlikely, but possible), it would still be a very bad idea because it would only leave us enough money for living expenses - nothing extra, like going out to eat or even buying clothes for the wedding - for the rest of January. I know boyfriend really wants to go, and I'm worried I'm being mean by saying no, but I think it's an awful decision financially. Looking for either tips to help the conversation go more smoothly, or for someone to point out I'm being a jerk about it and we should obviously go to his brother's wedding."
26,"I [22M] haven't been able to gain closure from a mistake I made 2 years ago


Throwaway due to main account being very identifiable.

&amp;#x200B;

I'll try to give a good amount of background detail without writing a novel. Two years ago, I betrayed one of my best friends, Tom, by hooking up with his boyfriend Jay. Tom and Jay had an open relationship, but I was selfish and didn't stop to think about how it was different to hook up with a stranger vs a good friend. I was ashamed and ended up trying to pretend it never happened, but Tom found out and ended our friendship understandably so.

I was able to convince Tom to meet with my about a month after he found out and ended our friendship, in order to at least apologize to him in person. It didn't go over great. I could make up excuses as to why, but really I was neglecting to take responsibility for my part. I didn't acknowledge how much I must've hurt him by betraying his trust. I don't think I was able to express to Tom how deeply I lament what I did and how it ruined our friendship.

Now 2 years have gone by and I still find myself dwelling on this frequently. I've come to accept my fault in what I've done and taken this hard lesson as an opportunity to grow. Still, it bothers me a lot that in the end I never gave Tom the apology he actually deserved.

It's hard to describe the terms on which it ended. Tom and I don't communicate directly anymore. We are still friends on social media and occasionally like each others things, sometimes even respond to one another's stories. I know the advice here would be to block him on all social media, but I'm afraid that would still not allow me to gain closure. I think for a long time, I've felt undeserving of closure because I feel as if I deserve the pain of this open wound for what I did.

I've wanted so many times to reach out and express to Tom how sorry I am. But, I don't want to dredge this up for him after/if he's likely moved on. He doesn't owe me anything and he isn't responsible for my ability to gain closure. But... at this point, if I don't try to tell him how I feel even after all this time, I'm afraid I'll always hold that regret

Would it be weird to send him an apology letter? I don't want to be selfish, but I also need to stop letting this wound fester. If so, how would I even go about it?

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR: I betrayed my ex-best friend 2 years ago and never gave him a proper apology. I'm still dwelling on it and I need to gain closure. I want to write him an apology letter. But, would it be selfish to dredge something up in his life that he has probably tried really hard to forget?

27,"I have no idea if I'm freaking out over nothing. Girl [20sF] blocked me [20sF] from viewing her IG stories.


Hi all, I will give some context.  

So because of a situation in my personal life, I've had to leave uni and all my friends, and move back to my home country this March. Since then, I've just been working a couple jobs, and trying to fix the personal situation so I can get back to school again. In this time though, I've become very lonely. I don't have any friends here, and don't really get any social interaction. Because of this, I decided to get involved with the community around my main hobby, which has been really great, and I've met lots of cool people. One of them is this girl, we'll call her H.  

Now I never *ever* get crushes on people, in fact, the last real one I had was probably in early high school. But when I do, I fall hard. And that's where I'm sort of at with H. We've only met in person a few times, at events in our city related to our hobby, but we talk all the time on instagram, since we both have accounts for the hobby on there. She's amazing, and we get along incredibly well. A few weeks ago, she invited me to go to an event with her, and we had an awesome time! She also then invited me to go to the next event with her. Even though I absolutely have a crush on her, I'd still be incredibly happy just to be her friend and hang out.  

Now I'm kind of paranoid about coming across as needy, or clingy, so I rarely message her first, it's always her messaging me, and it's basically just stuff related to our hobby. We both post pretty often on our IGs, (and she's always commenting on my posts) and our IG stories, but after the event a couple weeks ago, I noticed she wasn't putting up stories anymore, but I just figured she'd been busy, since she wasn't liking anyone's posts either and she does that from time to time when things get intense. We also haven't chatted since then. But she views every single one of my stories, and is one of the top 5 out of usually 100 or so viewers (which is apparently ranked by how much they view your profile and content), and responds to all my story polls and stuff.  
She got tagged in some story game yesterday by a mutual friend, but I noticed that she still wasn't posting anything on her story, until I saw another mutual friend's story pop up, where *they* had gotten tagged by *her* to do the game. Even though she hadn't made a story.  
I got kind of freaked out, because I realised then she may have blocked me from viewing hers. So, I went to my old, personal account, where we don't follow each other, and lo and behold, she had a story up (didn't view it or anything, just saw that she had one). So I guess she's been using it this whole time, I just haven't been able to see it. The thing is, I have no clue on earth why.  

I would obviously assume I've done something wrong, but *she's* the one that invited me to go to the last and next event with her, and always messages me first, and she's in the top viewers for mine, and always responds to polls and the like, so I don't think she's angry with me. She's a private person, and often has things going on in her personal life that she doesn't like to talk about, but why would that result in her blocking just me from just her stories? I also would suspect that maybe I did something wrong at the last event we went to, but again, she's the one who messaged me afterwards saying what a great time she had and if we could do the next one together too. I seriously like her so much (though obviously have given no indication of that irl) and even if nothing comes of that, I really don't want to lose her friendship, since she's the only friend I've made all year that i really feel I connected with.  

I don't know, are there other reasons she might have done this? Or is it not a big deal and I'm just reading into it too much? It's just this, in combination with the fact we haven't chatted since the event is freaking me out, and I'm not sure what I did wrong. I don't have ANY experience with relationships, or social media dynamics like this, so I have no clue what's going on. Any advice at all is appreciated, and thank you for reading this far.  

TL;DR Met this girl earlier this year who I get on exceptionally well with, make my first real friend in a while, and definitely have a huge crush on her. All has been going great, she shows no indication that anything is wrong, and yet apparently I've been blocked from viewing her IG stories for a couple weeks. "

She had a lot of drama in her life from parents divorcing to some pretty messy drama in high school.
-I understand she had a hard time and all. Her dad is a real pos. About 400 pounds and does nothing but trash talk her mom.

In high school, she dated some popular football player and got in a lot of drama with him where they would break up, he would talk trash about her online and she would say stuff online too. This led to the “popular” kids not liking her. 
-From some details I heard, it sounded like she was a bit a part of the drama

When she tried out for the cheerleading team, they didn’t let her in. Her mom got involved and said they were only letting in their friends and people they liked, so she had the school force them to let her in.
-Her mom was heavily involved and definitely played a roll in stirring up the drama, so that struck me a bit weird.

She got bullied by many people saying she was just causing drama.
-Again, it felt like that might have been partly her and her mom.

She told me all about this pretty early on and cried about it.
-I realized she opens up A LOT very fast.

She began talking about her exes A LOT.
I know way too many details about these guys. How many shoes one guys has, his moms history of drug use, girls he has dated, etc.
-I just think this is distasteful. I’m not the jealous type, but this rubbed me the wrong way after a while.

She would bring things up in a way that would nudge me into asking about something where she would bring up details about her exes. She would go on and on and on until I just budded in and changed the subject.
-Again, I really wasn’t a fan of it. I never seemed enthusiastic about it or happy to talk about it, but she was awfully excited to talk about it and didn’t really catch my hints.

She dated some guy that would just use her for sex but would keep hanging around and said “I just don’t know what I saw in him, but I REALLY liked him”.
-Ok, so it seemed like it was a fwb but she didn’t want to say it that way or she didn’t have much integrity at that time.

Before that guy, she dated some guy for 3 years. She said she was over him but apparently didn’t have closure and cried when she found out he had a new gf. I asked her how she could get over it and she said she would need call him or just wait a long time. I said just call. She called while she was at my house (I know, kinda weird) but has been perfectly fine since then.
-Of course this wasn’t cool in my eyes.

She said she hates to be alone and needs the attention.
-Not good in my eyes.

She REALLY digs for details about me and my dating past. She searched my ex up on Facebook as soon as she knew her name. Her. And her mom gossiped about it. Her brothers gf Facebook stalked her as well.
-That struck me as invasive, insecure, and immature.

On that note, her mom is in her 50’s and is a real socialite. Gossips A TON. Loves expensive jewelry. That kind of stuff.
-I think her mom is hard working but is a classic pageant mom.

I eventually found out when my gf got a Pap smear that she has HPV. So I got HPV from her.
(Human Papilloma Virus. Not Herpes)
-I know it doesn’t affect guys as much as girls, but it really bothers me because I don’t want to pass it on to any future partner.

With that 3 year ex, her mom really didn’t like him and “forced” her to go on some date with some pharmacist because he had money. She told her not to tell her bf. She apparently felt terrible after and told him immediately.
-BS. Anyone with integrity wouldn’t do that.

She would continue to talk about her exes, random guys that hit on her, etc.
Example: “Last time I was here, there was this group of guys that were hitting on me and my mom and I thought it was so funny. We were just cracking up.”
I ended up telling her that it was weird she did stuff like this and she stopped.
-I feel like she’s trying to talk herself up and/or make me jealous.

A LOT of humble bragging. From talking about how pretty people say she is to her grades.
-This is just annoying.

When watching tv shows, she will say “He’s HOT” multiple times every episode where there’s some hunky guy.
-I feel it’s fine every once in a while but not 6 times a night.

She needs to see me every single day and is mildly upset if I need to get my own stuff done.
-I just don’t like the pressure. I’m self employed and don’t have structure like her school, so she doesn’t seem to see that I am pretty busy most of the time.

She is really good at at slanting things to make it seem like I am being bad or in the wrong.
-I am pretty good at stepping back and looking at things from the outside, and she I realize she can really manipulate a situation. Even sometimes when we fight, she’ll raise her voice, I’ll raise mine, then she lowers her voice and says I’m being toxic for raising my voice.

Well there’s a list of some of the factors in our relationship and my take on it. If I seem out of line in any of my views, let me know.

Thanks a bunch.

TLDR: looking to evaluate my take on my ending relationship with my gf and my takes on some of the situation?

31,"My [23M] Girlfriend's [22F] Dad Went To Jail, Need Help Supporting Her


A few months ago, my girlfriend's dad suddenly disappeared from her and her family's life entirely more than he already had before. She didn't know what happened at first so she did some research and found out he got arrested. For murder. Now, her dad was very abusive to her in the past and was hellbent on her to be a good person and would literally beat her until she got that lesson, even for the smallest mistakes. He also did this to her mother and she had to witness this first hand until he got kicked out of the house and lived on his own.

&amp;#x200B;

However, even throughout all of this, it's still her dad and she still has some sort of emotional connection to him. She'd never thought of him as a murderer and a person who'd run from the cops and change their name to try and evade them. This is has shattered her image of him even far worse than she ever anticipated before.

&amp;#x200B;

Even now, it is still hard for her to come to terms with the fact that this has happened and it's something that keeps her up at night and she tries to bottle up her feelings for it. She has to go through the struggles of this every day and pretending that everything is alright when she tells me very often that it's not ok and she is still having trouble with it.

&amp;#x200B;

The problem is that I really love her and would like to help her, but nothing even remotely closely bad to this has ever happened to me so I can't relate to her or even begin to imagine how her pain feels. I really need help on how to help her come to terms with the fact that she'll never see her father again. She can visit him in jail but she isn't emotionally ready yet to visit him, nor even talk to him over the phone. What can I do to help her? She's a really smart and amazing person and I don't want this to stop her from achieving far greater things in her life which she still has a lot of time left in.

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR my girlfriend's dad went to jail for murder, she can't come to terms with accepting it and it's damaging her emotionally.

32,"My FWB introduced me to his friend that I REALLY like


I am 24/F and the 2 men are both 25/M. I met FWB in college, and we became secret FWB. Everyone knew we became friends suddenly, no one knew we were sleeping together. 2.5 years later of which we both lived in different cities the whole time (and countries at one point), it got more public (close friends knew) but we were both sleeping with other people in our respective cities and slept together when we were together since he lived in the same city as my family and friends, so I visited occasionally. This past summer, he moved to the same state as me (not same city, but very close). I was visiting him and broached the conversation of possibly getting more serious, and he said he wasn’t ready for that. I understood and continued dating in my city. I decided it was probably best for us to not date if he wasn’t super into me and ready for that step after 2.5 years. 

He came to visit me and see a friend in the area for the sports event. We slept together once during the weekend. The day before he left, he invited another friend to come get drinks with us. I immediately connected with the friend. We had great rapport, he is super cute. After, I told FWB I wanted to hang out with the friend, as we lived in the same city and get along. FWB sent me friends number. 

I texted the friend, we made plans to meet, and I told FWB that we were hanging out (he was fine with it). We got drinks at a bar and spent over 3 hours taking and drinking 2 beers. We hugged at the end. I had an amazing time and knew I wanted to keep hanging out, but didn’t want to be presumptuous. He texted me the next day to tell me he had a great time and would love to hang out again. We made plans to get dinner and drinks, which is tonight. We’ve been texting a bit since then. 

I’m so excited about it and think I really like this guy. I realize it’s too early to tell, but I don’t know how to handle this situation. Am I crossing a line with my FWB if I kiss his friend after the date tonight (if he’s into it)? Do I tell him we’re going on a date, or say we’re hanging out, or not mention it at all? 

The friendship is important to me, but I haven’t been this excited about someone in a long time, and the FWB has been sleeping with other people and explicitly said he wasn’t looking for a relationship. I feel like I’m not doing anything wrong, but my friends have said that he’d probably be very upset if this happened, so decide if this guy is worth possibly losing a long time friend (FWB) over. 

TLDR; my FWB introduced me to his friend, can I date him? How do I tell FWB?"
33,"I [22F] am getting sick and tired of my girlfriend's [20sF] fame


Hello, I've been a long time reader of this sub and I can't believe I'm actually posting a problem and asking for advice. However, to keep myself reputable, this is a throwaway account.

&amp;#x200B;

I've been dating my girlfriend for exactly 1 year and 10 months now. I met her because of a mutual friend and we hit it off pretty quick. I didn't know she was gay, but here we are. To clear things off, she isn't publicly gay and this is the root of every problem that came our way into the relationship.

&amp;#x200B;

As of now, she is probably getting ready to go on a fake date with some boy to stir the media off, while I stayed up all night feeling sad and lonely, playing RDR2 with a bunch of violent Aussies and a fourteen-year-old boy.

&amp;#x200B;

Earlier today, we started arguing because she ditched me to go on a random date during the most random time while we were spending time together. She freaking ditched me so she can fake date a boy she barely knows for PHOTOS. 

&amp;#x200B;

Pardon me if you're a celebrity, but I don't get what's with you people and fake-dating for fame. Are you people never satisfied of all the good praises you get from people you meet every day? 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm sitting on my bed, contemplating whether I should break it off with her or be patient. And I'm crying too.

&amp;#x200B;

Now, I know what you guys are going to say. If I'm not happy, then why am I staying? 

That's because I love her and I want to understand her better. I know you have all heard that come from people a thousand times but can we please broaden our advices? I want to think of better choices other than just breaking things off for a problem that has more than one solution.

&amp;#x200B;

Her and her management are so scared to make her come out because she might get negative publicity but it's almost 2019 and people have stopped caring. The homophobic population is dying out. Nothing's wrong with being gay.

&amp;#x200B;

I completely love her and I feel whole whenever she's around. I've never had the same experience from past relationships. I thought this was going to for a long time and I'd be able to hang out to being kept a secret for awhile but it has literally been almost 2 years and everyone still thinks she's straight. 

&amp;#x200B;

We argued and she didn't even wanna hear it from me because apparently it was the same thing over and over again and she has told me the same thing over and over again too: she can't come out, yet.  I want to be able to walk with her in public like a normal couple. Just being around her in public rather than being locked up in a room together would be better. She won't even introduce me to the public as a friend because apparently everyone will be suspicious.

&amp;#x200B;

I don't understand any of this situation at all. It has come to the point where I'm wishing I wasn't dating a famous person instead. I'm so sorry if this is a mess. I'm a mess too. I'll try to make my situation clearer on my tldr.

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR: my girlfriend's fame is stopping her from coming out, fearing that she might get a lot of hate for it. We argued because she ditched me to go on a ""fake date"" with another famous guy. I feel like this relationship is going nowhere because it has almost been 2 years and I'm still kept a secret. "
34,"[23M] How to deal with my depressed girlfriend [19F] shutting me out



We met a little over two months ago. I had never seen her before but we happened to be sitting alone in the hallway together after class. She randomly approached me and came onto me pretty aggressively. I asked for her number and for the next two weeks she would message me everyday telling me how much she likes me or how handsome I am. In real life we flirt a bit but I dont fully tell her I'm interested in her until around two weeks in (which isnt as bad as it sounds bc I’m only on campus twice a week which is the only time we can see each other irl). 



Then i noticed some changes. She had mentioned how bad she wanted to have pictures of me on her phone so the next weekend I sent her some. I thought she would respond instantly like she had been but it took about 24 hours to hear anything back. The following week she texted me asking if we’d get to see each other, I told her that we could hang out after class and that I’d be on campus soon. Once class was over I let her know I was out and she never responded or came to see me. Two days later I asked what happened to her and she told me she was failing some of her classes and spent the day in tutoring. I have no issues with her focusing on her schoolwork but it did annoy me that she didn’t tell me she was going to do that, ignored my text messages when I asked where she went, left without even saying hi/bye , and didn’t message me at all for two days. 



This sort of thing became somewhat common. Neither one of us have a car but we had made plans to go to the movies that weekend bc we hadn’t been able to spend much time together. She said her sister could take her to the theatre to meet me on Saturday, I said I’d text her Friday so we could get the details figured out. So, Friday I message her and ask if she still wants to hangout, she doesn’t respond at all until Saturday night and says something came up with her family.



For the next few weeks I saw her less and less due to her going to tutoring and we started texting less frequently as well. She very rarely would message me first and if I was the one to initiate the conversation she’d usually either not respond or take 24 hours. 



I think at this point any normal person would assume that she wasn’t into them anymore and would just move on but the days when she didn’t have to study and we could see each other in person it was like nothing had changed. She was super sweet and was all over me. I asked why there were so many mixed signals with her regarding how she acts irl but won’t talk to me otherwise. She tells me she’s been extremely depressed and has had a history of feeling that way. She says she had tried killing herself in the past and was rushed to the hospital. But more recently she tells me about a dream where she was preparing to hang herself and couldn’t bring herself to do it in the dream. When she woke up she felt sad that she wasn’t able to. She shows me messages from her family asking why she won’t respond to their texts and says she’s stopped talking to a lot of her online friends (she typically stays home and plays games on steam). She mentions that she can manage it to some extent when shes out of her house but when she goes home to her physically abusive/super religious family she feels terrible and can’t bring herself to talk to anyone. 



This whole scenario makes me feel pretty insecure because I’m a very anxious person and when she cuts me out I assume the worst (I’m boring, she’s not interested in me anymore, she found someone else). Even though she acts normal when we spend time together irl, I don’t see her often due to tutoring and rarely talk outside of school due to her depression. So 99% of the week it feels like I’m single. 



We’re getting ready to start winter break which is 5-6 weeks off from school. I’m concerned that nothing will change except I’ll see her even less. However, I still like her and am hoping once the responsibility of school leaves we can go back to how things were. 



Does anyone have experience dealing with a SO with depression? What are things I can do to help her/what should I avoid doing? Would depression really be the reasoning for her change in behavior or is it likely something else is going on? If over break she continues to flake on me with our irl plans and still rarely sends texts at what point are we just wasting our time together?



TLDR: Due to my current school schedule and her extremely abusive muslim parents, my gf and I are only able to see each other about two hours a week (in which shes very affectionate towards me). Outside of those two hours we haven’t been talking because shes been depressed/suicidal and won’t respond to anyone’s text messages. I’m wondering if theres anything I should avoid when dealing with someone who has depression and how I should approach the 5 week winter break coming up.

Backstory: My girlfriend and I have been together for several years. A few months ago I decided to end the relationship, because it simply is not working out anymore.

However, shortly after I made up my mind, my girlfriend's sister died in a car crash and she has been struggling ever since. My girlfriend has always been a bit mentally unstable and now things are worse than ever before. I am however very unhappy in this relationship and really want to end it, but I am afraid that my breakup would make things worse to the point where I am afraid she might harm herself or even worse.

She is a great person and I really want to stay friends with her, but I have been unhappy in this relationship for so long but I still care about her and simply don't know what to do.

I would appreciate any advice you guys can give me.

36,"Modern romance or righteous disaster?


My (26M) boyfriend and I (23F) have been together for 5 years. We want to spend our lives together, and have kids but I come from a very religious family. My parents and older siblings would be incensed if I decided to live in sin without getting married, but what they don’t know can’t hurt them.... to a point. 


The thing is, we are happy, we are settled, but marriage feels like it might add pressure and ruin a good thing. We have known each other for much of our lives, so we have a pretty solid background. 


This whole idea of soulmates and all this pressure to find the perfect one to measure up stresses me out to no end and makes me question a good thing. We work together, we are happy, but if we don’t get married and make it honest, my family will be furious. They will be crushed. 


I have always sought out their respect and in my large family, we have a tight bond. I’m just tired of them controlling all of our lives. How do I live with knowing that while I may be happier not getting married, my family will be completely disappointed in me and will not bless my relationship? I’m forever torn between what I feel is best for me, and the love I have for them. 


TL;DR - religious family insists on marriage before sex or children; I’m not sure if I’m willing to follow their path, but don’t want them to be crushed"
37,"My [19M] dad [53M] is very controlling over when and where I can go. He says it’s he “loves” and “cares” for me - surely I’m not the crazy on


Hey guys,

My whole life my dad has been over protective - and influenced my mother to be like this too. I was never allowed to go out after school, was never able to go to my friends house during the night - sleep overs wasn’t a thing. I wasn’t enrolled in any sports due to most training sessions being after 4pm - and this being “too late” - as well as the chance of being injured as a result of the sport. I guess with all that said, you can see the amount sheltering I’ve had as a kid. 

This has caused me anxiety when it comes to seemingly normal activities, such as eating out in public or staying out late, even generally crowded situations. Now, as someone studying psychology, I’m aware that the only effective way to remedy my anxiety is to slowly expose oneself to those situations, and any form of avoidance or lack of exposure will inevitably contribute to perpetuation of the anxiety.  

I’ve tried to sit my dad down and talk to him very maturely about this but he seems very dismissive of the fact I have anxiety - almost doesn’t think it’s legit because “I never told him earlier.”. My mum has come around and, although she knows her words won’t matter to my dad, she’s encouraging me - in a way - to just rebel. 

When my dad and I have spoken about it, he uses the argument of “love” and “care” as a reason as to why he doesn’t want me to go out. He says I’m too young and don’t have enough experience, to which I respond with “well how else am I meant to gain experience?” he then responds with, “when you’re older”. 

I don’t know if I’m just being a troubled child - because that’s what he’s making me feel like - or if I’m completely rational in my thinking. I know he was somewhat over protected or at least didn’t go out as often as a kid. 

A recent example I can provide is, yesterday I went to visit my lovely girlfriend, she lives a fair distance away, about 25km or so. He didn’t like the distance but it was early during the day so he accepted it. Today I come home and tell him I’m going to the cinemas at night with a group of friends from uni. He then gets very mad and says “no”. I kind of just had to convince and stand my ground. 

I don’t know how this will end, he mentioned once during a convo about this that, “if you keep disregarding what I say, I’ll have to take action” and never really specified what was meant by action. For many reason, i can’t really comfortably move out... my back up plan is living in my car for a bit until I sort something out 

Thanks in advance for all the help. 

*tl;dr - My dad is currently angry that I have gone out two days in a row. He does not want me going anywhere that he decides is “too far” and he does not like me out during the night (maybe from about 6pm onwards). He says it’s because of his love and care but surely this is tyranny.*"
38,"Is this stalking? Should partner be blocking stalker?



I (f35) noticed my friend (f35) started increasingly interacting online with my partner (m36) after she broke up with her ex. Over time she got more distant from me but her interactions with my partner increased.

At one point after this had been happening a while my partner spring on me he was heading to meet her to loan her a book on his lunch hour at work. We were meeting up the next day, it triggered a lot of jelousy, fears and insecurity from me. I confronted her and she just claimed scattiness. After a while I even asked her outright if she had a crush on my partner, she denied it. I pointed out I never see much of her online anymore but she always sees partners stuff and she laughed it off.

At some point it came up that she regularly went through partners workplace, always with a reasonable excuse for being there but it never sat right with me nor did her constant interactions with partner.

Things came to a head when I called partner after work as we normally do and he accidentally answered. I heard him with her moaning about me, mostly minor things but it was hurtful. When he got home I asked if he saw her and he outright lied to my face which led to a huge row.

In the fallout from the row it came out that she had been talking privately to eldest daughter and had asked her to keep the news she was pregnant from me or my MIL (both MIL and I had invited her to family things). It was phrased basically ""Hey Big Sis, put news up but his news from (me and MIL names) for obvious reasons lol"" note not his from my partner!

I hit the roof accused both of an affair, which I later apologized for. I was satisfied there was no affair, logistically it's impossible but found it hard to shake there wasn't some sort of deeper friendship or something going on.

Not long after friend calls me a Call word on Facebook then blocks me from everything but not my partner. I literally did nothing to provoke it. Partner makes things worse by insisting I must have done something offensive or said something for her to act that way and hide pregnancy from me.

I have previously had real issues with trust after an awful experience with my ex, which is why partner said he lied about seeing her to avoid an argument like after the book incident.

From my perspective though this women hates me because she clearly has some thing for my partner and eldest daughter and partner griping about me has led to her has not helped.

I don't think it's normal or acceptable to have your Twitter feed literally full an. Compromising 90% of your friends partner whom he has three kids with and has been with close to a decade.

Am I unreasonable to be cross at partner for taking her side, not sticking up for me when she was childish and vile and not blocking her? Everytime she crops up online (she doesn't know my new Twitter and Facebook shows comments and likes but vanishes them) it reopens the wounds of feeling betrayed by them both and sadness of losing a friendship etc.

Partner and I are in waiting list for couples counseling, she was never inappropriate in person. Although looking back with just me no makeup, if she knew partner word be there she would have makeup on and low cut top etc. She would wait until he felt he had to offer her lifts home a few times too.

Partners line is basically I can't dictate who he sees or talks to, my line is her continued presence online with him is upsetting me and will continue to and that It's going to be an ongoing source of arguments especially if he insists on keeping her there.

TL;DR: I find her online stalking unacceptable, weird and I want partner to recognise it and block her but he refuses because he says I am being jealous and she was fine in person. He is definitely not being unfaithful, I have past issues with insecurity and freaking out over innocent things and he's acting like this is the same thing.

39,"My(32M) GF(25F) said that if/when we move in together, she would eventually want seperate bedrooms. Is is strange that I'm upset?


Throwaway because she knows my username. 

Some background: we dated casually for 2 years, seriously for 6 months. She moved far away for school 4 months ago. Long distance is hard but we see each other for about 1 week per month. She will likely move back to my town soon-ish. We would definitely move in together at that time, and are talking about getting married at some point after.

I snore somewhat, and toss and turn at night. It keeps her up a little sometimes, we joke about it rarely, but for now it's nothing major and doesn't seem to be a big problem. 

Yesterday in casual conversation about sleep, houses, etc., she mentioned she would want seperate bedrooms if we lived together and my snoring/tossing got worse. I told her it always gets worse with age, and she said in that case, at that time she would want seperate bedrooms. 

I had never really considered that as an option before, but the more I thought about it the more it upset me. If I end up with this person, there's a good chance I'll have to go to sleep and wake up alone every night/morning, and wouldn't have someone to hold at night, etc. I know this is relatively common (25% in the US in some studies), but I would feel so incredibly lonely. I told her how much it upset me, and she said maybe we could have a ""compromise"" where we would sleep together every other night or something, but I feel even that would be unsustainable for me. 

Is that strange? I never really considered myself particularly needy, but is this an unreasonable need? She got pretty upset and accused me of putting my emotional need above her basic survival need (sleep). I understand that, and I would never want to subject her to my sleep habits if it became that bad. However, the thought of sleeping alone for the rest of my life starting when my snoring gets worse (probably middle age, which for me isn't too far away) is depressing to no end, and I don't know if I could handle it. I know it's a long way off, but is it better to establish this as an irreconcilable difference now, or wait until we are married and living together for multiple years to decide between divorce or a lifetime of lonliness? Making matters worse, this girl is the love of my life, and I want to be with her in every sense of the word more than anyone else I have ever met. So, this situation would hurt even more if I end up with her compared to someone else.

I'm pretty devastated and dont know what to do. Any advice would be greatly appreciated, thank you so much. "

I have questioned her before and she believes the child is not mine.

Looking at the child's pictures, they are very similar to my childhood pictures.

42,"My [26M] friend [25M] has gone through multiple personality changes.


When I first met my friend in 2009, he was a GnR fan with dog tags fingerless gloves. He eventually got a Slash tattoo.
Following that he went through a punk stage, huge mohawk and everything. He covered his Slash tattoo with a Rise Against one.
Next he dressed like a Sons of Anarchy biker with a Confederacy flag (without realising what it meant).
Next, he was a 'NewRetroWave' fan and always dressed like the Terminator.
After this, he became obsessed with Iceland/Bjork, grew a beard and got a bunch of Icelandic tattoos, covering his Rise Against tattoo.
Now he's a genderless Buddhist, went vegan and legally changed his (their) name after ""understanding"" David Lynch. He had his Icelandic tattoos removed and looks dangerously thin.

The first few changes he was still the old him with a few 'layers', but now me and him have literally nothing in common. I feel like he can't settle down and he's just going to change his personality again in a year or so. I've always kept quiet about it until his brother brought up the subject about him looking ill. Is it worth talking with him to find out what's happening or should I just keep quiet and continue to support whatever he chooses?

46,"22M, How To Tell If You Have A Crush On Someone?


I've been having some mixed feelings about this girl I've known for a while. We work in the same lab and for the first year, we didn't interacted much and our relationship was strictly work-based. However, entering this semester we started to become closer but for a while, for some reason her presence made me feel uncomfortable. So I thought I had a crush on her but then it didn't. It was clear then. But we hung out more and shared some of our life stories. From that I was able to relate to her more and got closer to her. After that, I wanted to become closer to her as a friend but I am starting to have a bad feeling that I might actually have a feeling/crush on her. I call this bad feeling because she already has a boyfriend. So the question is how do you know when you actually have a crush or for me, am I just wanting to become a better friend to her? How do you know this?"

48,"I (19M) met someone (17-19F) I'm interested in last week, but don't know how to get in touch with her. How can I get in touch with her again without a creepy vibe?


I'm attending classes in a high school upgrading program offered by my city downtown. There are a couple hundred students who attend, and I really don't know many people from my high school that currently go there. Last week on Friday, however, I bumped into a group working a school raffle table, and found them to be a great group to be around and hang out with.

While I was hanging out with them, ""K"" as I'll call her, stopped by the table to talk and hang out with us.  We shared stories and had a chat about the raffle, and I noticed that I really enjoyed her personality, and that she was quite pretty. We shared about ourselves and joked around, and it was enjoyable being around these new people, K especially.

However, we had to cut things short when classes started, and we all split. I had a test to get to, so I was in a bit of a rush, and unfortunately wasn't able to ask if they had social media to keep in touch. Since Friday I've been hoping to bump into K and the others, but only had luck finding one of them from the group just yesterday.

I know I shouldn't be thinking about her this much when we've only met once, but I just keep thinking of K. I really want to meet up and spend time with her, just as friends of course despite my interest in her. However, I worry that trying to find her in person or on social media may come across as creepy, and I really don't want to put off that vibe since I'm really not trying to be. How would I be able to get back in touch with her without creeping her out?  


TL;DR: I met someone once last week, developed a liking for her, and have no way to get back in touch with her again and am looking for advice to do so without looking like a creep.

50,"I [26m] keep comparing every girl I date to my ex [22f]


Some backstory: My ex and I were together for 4 years. She’s really the only girl I’ve ever deeply loved. We were both students at university, and I was on my way out when she was on her way in. Things changed, goals changed, and we broke it off very amicably. I’ll always love her, and I think she’s great, but we agreed that it was best to go our separate ways. 

I don’t know what to do. It’s been 6 months since our breakup. I felt that I could get out and meet new people. I’ve been going on dates pretty frequently, and I’ve been seeing this new girl for about a month. Not entirely sure if I’m into her but I’m getting to know her slowly and she seems cool enough. I think the only thing holding me back is that I constantly compare her to my ex and I don’t want to do that but I can’t help myself. My ex and I had a very strong connection, likely due to unhealthy codependency, and everything else just feels mediocre compared to the passion we shared. 

It sounds like I’m not over her, and maybe I’m not, but I’ve been at peace with our break up for some time now, and I’d really like to move on. What do you guys think? 

Tl;dr: I can’t stop comparing new girls I dare to my ex, and I want to move on. "
51,"Me [29 M] with my romantic friend [29 F], An opinion of what's going on


So me and this girl have been romantically involved for the past couple of months, the only thing is we live about 1.5 hours away from each other. So we've only really hung out twice, but we talk every day.

Well for the last two weeks we've had a beach trip planned, with me taking off work to do so.

Well yesterday she said to me at about 11PM after not speaking to me all day that she won't be able to make it due to some special circumstances. (Which are completely legitimate reasons)

But she tells me this and has not said a word to me, other than that in 2 days time. I'm just really confused and would like some advice on the situation.

Me and girl have been talking for months pretty much everyday, have a vacation set up. A couples days before the trip she cancels, and hasn't said a word to me since."
52,"I [38M] am struggling with my relationship with girlfriend [45F] after opening up more..


Hey guys, really appreciate honest advice here. I'm struggling deeply emotionally and don't know where to go..

I met my girlfriend about 6 years ago now.. we were both at a dark, difficult time in life.. probably me more than her. She had lost a loved one and was recovering from illness; I was socially isolated and had a struggling work life. We were a huge, honest comfort to each other. I had been burned from my last relationship also, and unable to really emotionally give too much. Still felt connected and loyal to that previous girl..

However, she was there for me so consistently. Our relationship wasn't very sexual at first, although she wanted me that way. I was gunshy to get involved and feel used again by a woman with her own agenda. She was also involved in a longterm companionate relationship with a guy who she had nursed through illness, which wouldn't change in her life.. so I didn't want to care or need too much from her, knowing I might not get enough back.

Fast forward to today.. we have both changed so much. We are stronger, happier, healthier. My work is stronger, although my social life has pretty much stayed empty except for her. Her's is full and flourishing on the other hand.
We never betrayed the other to my knowledge. It has been a sweet and caring relationship. However, I have been frustrated in the last two years sexually.. wanting more. To have better, more intimate sex with her and broaden our horizons.. go out more, fantasize, etc..

This went great initially, she was so excited and connected, as I had been more sexually reserved. However, I mostly did that to protect myself. I stated my need to hear from her and see her more, if we open up more like this. Basically, going from a more friend based relationship to really connected and romantic. She seemed to understand, but one distraction has seemed to come after another and her busy life just kept pulling her back to the old norm.

This hurts me greatly. I feel like she's having her cake and eating it too (I'm always there when she needs me, but seldom in reverse). I told her that if we open to this deeper connection, I need her more than on just the weekends. I told her, I wish she'd stop by randomly, or spontaneously meet. She always nods happily, but later nothing happens.

She loves the sex and new things we are sharing. She repeatedly tells me this. When it comes to giving me more connection though, she just keeps falling to old patterns. Kinda self-absorbed, distant and distracted. There's always some crisis going on with her that prevents me from getting more of what I hope for and need. She's a genuinely sweet person, but this is maddening!

I feel really burned and can't put my finger on exactly why. She's nothing but sweet, just will not change her patterns. She seems to want to, but then I'm there to give her good sex and she seems to lose motivation.

I have tried to grapple with this and not sure if my lack of a life is all this is, or if I have a legitimate reason to be hurt. I just know I am hurt.. like 10 hours a day, my heart hurts. I love her and she's the most important person in my life, so I can't just 'break up and move on'. If I did, it would crush me for years.

I have asked a therapist about my issues and this.. he indicated I have light signs of borderline disorder. Meaning, I have real trouble sustaining trusting connection with people and may be more demanding than the norm. I am struggling with guilt and self-loathing of asking too much.. but god, I just want so much from her. I wish we could have more.

Unfortunately, it doesn't look like this may happen. She is absorbed in her own life and patterns and seems to get hurt when I am hurt. Whenever I express pain about this, she gets cold and acts like I am disappointed in her when she's giving all she can. All I want to do is reach out to her and have this passionate, romantic relationship that keeps moving us deeper.

No way to get someone to want something as much, so it leads me to closing my heart and shutting down. She's confused at this, as she comes to meet me on weekends all happy, from the rest of her busy social life. My question is, am I the asshole here? Please help me get some clarity!

Thank you all so much..

TL;DR: An older, friendship based relationship which evolved beautifully is hurting me now as I try to ask for more and she isn't really giving more, even though she seems to want it and agree. Old patterns.."

58,"I (22f) want to get married. My boyfriend (23m) doesn’t believe in marriage. Is this enough to end an otherwise perfect relationship?


Reposting to add TL;DR at the bottom. Title pretty much says it. We’ve been together for 2 years and we have a great relationship. We rarely fight, we care for each other very much, and we’re truly best friends. There’s just been one issue that keeps coming back up. 

I’ve wanted to get married since I was a little girl. It doesn’t have to be any time soon (I actually would prefer to wait quite a while) but I want to know that we are striving for marriage in our relationship. It’s a milestone and a sign of commitment. I want to be a family with one last name to raise our kids as husband and wife. It’s not even about the wedding. I wouldn’t mind getting married at the court house if it meant we were legally bound. I want the symbolism marriage provides. 

He understands how I feel, but he doesn’t agree. He thinks it’s not necessary and that he can show me commitment in other ways. He says he just wants to be with me forever and doesn’t need a piece of paper to prove it. He also thinks you have a lot to lose in a marriage (if it ends up leading to divorce). He wants to just be in a healthy committed relationship with me forever, without getting married. 

I don’t disagree with his points but no matter how hard I try I can’t get rid of my feelings towards marriage. He has said he will marry me if it means I’ll stay with him, but I don’t know how I can knowing he won’t be happy if we get married. He said he will always have preferred we didn’t. I want someone who wants to marry me, but I don’t want to throw away an otherwise amazing relationship. 

I’m just looking for some outside perspective. Am I being ridiculous? Is marriage really worth ending a great relationship? Is there any way to compromise on this? 

TL;DR - boyfriend of 2 years and I have different views on marriage but have an otherwise great relationship. Is this enough to part ways? "
59,"Is my (31m) girlfriend (29f) of 11 months hiding something with me with her ex or am I misunderstanding everything?


I’d like some perspective on this. It seems silly especially with our ages, and I suppose it’s more about the double standards I perceive in this relationship..

So last night we were at a game and my girlfriend of eleven months spots this ex of hers across the stadium. She says “that’s my asshole ex, ugh he keeps looking at me” and stuff like that. 

After we go to a bar and he comes in. He sits in the table behind us. She complains a bunch about him being there to me. Later the server brings over a couple shots she says were bought anonymously. He’s the only person either of us know in the bar.

She leans forward and asks me “do you think I should go talk to him?” and I reply “what would you say?” and she says “I know you bought the shot.” 

She chose not to talk to him and we left the bar but that struck me as odd because she has told me she hasn’t spoken to him in a year. Even though apparently he comes into the bar she works at on a regular basis and according to her she refuses to even talk to him. It seemed like an odd thing to break her refusal to speak to him over.

And the whole thing about him hanging out in her bar is weird. She claims he tells people she still
loves him, that’s she’s his ex and stuff, and gets drunk and belligerent. She claims that she hates him and refuses to talk to him and won’t even so much as wave at him and he’s a horrible person and an asshole and all sorts of names like that.

But that’s not the weird part. It’s that she omitted all of the times he came in for eight months, until mentioning in passing that this would happen. I’d always ask her after work if anything interesting happened at work and she just ... left that out. 

When she eventually told me it was more of an aside when I asked why she didn’t tell me she said she didn’t want me to think there was anything going on between them. I wouldn’t have,  but the omission -and for so long- made me wonder. Doubly so because I remember one time an ex of mine was in town to play a show and I saw her at a bar but didn’t talk to her and my gf was annoyed I didn’t tell her.

So her ex is from -I think- three years ago. They seemed to have a tumultuous relationship including him cheating on her, leaving for long lengths of time and being abusive (I don’t want to disbelieve her having been abused, but she’s also called me abusive for as little as not replying to texts so I feel like her definition of abuse might be a bit more encompassing than some peoples). I’m not clear on what kind of abuse it entailed, I haven’t asked. They also dated during a time in her life when she had some hardships including her father dying of cancer and her getting booted out of university for not having the money to pay tuition and her having a falling out with her mother that led to them not speaking for years.

Anyway, the entire thing eventually led to a big drunken fight. Not really about the ex, but rather because we agreed to talk about it tomorrow when we were sober and then she kept on insisting on bringing it up over and over again to insist there was nothing that happened between them. We have a “relationship safe word” that we use when a fight is starting that allows either of us to put off a discussion for up to 24 hours. I kept using it to and she wouldn’t respect it, which is what the fight was over.

So I just left her place cause of the fight, which I’m aware is some big deal to her because of issues dating back to that same ex of hers where he’d get mad and leave and not talk to her for weeks. Anyway she was predictably furious about my leaving, which I’m aware would happen and I chose to leave anyway, and indeed I do often leave and go home (I live in a city an hour away) a fair number of times in big fights so that’s on me.

TL/DR: gf and I got into a fight over an ex, about whom she’s been evasive for a long time, and I’m not sure what to read into the bizarre way they interact — is she hiding something or is he harassing her.. or both"
60,"My girlfriend [F18] decided to put our relationship on hold for a week. I don't feel good without her and don't know what to do...


It's my first time posting.... In all reddit I mean, so it's something really new to me (also my English isn't the best so sorry for that too). So my girlfriend and I [18] we're together 1 year and almost two months, during our relationship we did have some problems during June-July but thankfully we solved that. It was all going great in my opinion but that changed on Wednesday when she comes to me and says that she's putting on hold our relationship because she feels that during a week one day she's feeling okay but 3 days after that she feels bad for something that I did to her or she did to me. The problem is that lately neither me or she has done something wrong to each other and I don't know why she wanted to stop talking for a week, so I'm here 2 days after thinking about her and everytime I see her I cannot say anything to hear since she wants to spend some time without me. I want to at least send her a message but I'm afraid that she might get angry or respond me negatively because I didn't respect what she told me to do. I would like to know what could I tell her since it's 2 almost 3 days I don't talk or message her. If someone can give me some advice I would really appreciate it. Again sorry for my English, if you need me to clarify something just reply, pretty sure I will respond. Thank you "

My gf and I have been dating for the last six months (was our 6 months on the 23rd) and she broke up with me last night over the phone. We we're so happy together and I have so many great memories with her. We spent so much time together and loved each other to bits and I still love her so much. I bought her anything she wanted and gave her anything she needed. I was super depressed before I met her and actually thought about suicide many times. She came into my life and instantly changed it and made me so fucking happy. I'm scared I'm gonna go down a dark path like I did before I met her. 

She won't tell me why she broke up with me I just made her promise it was not because of another guy bc I don't think I could deal with that. I really wanna talk to her in person about it but she says we need time to think. What do I have to think about when she won't tell me why this is happening. 

I cant stand it. I love her so much and this sucks because we have the same friends so we'll see each other all the time. Not having somebody I can call whenever and talk about anything with and just lay in bed and watch movies and eat food with fucking sucks. I'm alone again and just knowing she won't be in my life the same way breaks my heart.

I explain myself and she replies with an ""ok"" then calls me names and blocks me on Facebook, Snapchat, Instagram.

66,"My boyfriend [24 M] and I [23 F] have been together for over a year and recently moved cross country. I've been having some worries and wonder, are my relationship concerns valid? If so, how do I address them?


As the title says, we've been together for a little over a year and had already lived together near our respective homes for a few months prior to moving cross-country. Our relationship has definitely had ups and downs, mainly because we've realized we interpret and receive love differently. Like any good relationship, we've had to put in work.



In the past, I've struggled for reasons that I know will sound selfish and shallow. For instance, he never really compliments my appearance or the work I put into things I care about. Previous boyfriends have been much more vocal in expressing their attraction and love but not him.



I've told him before that verbal affirmation is important to me, it's how I recognize that I'm loved. He, on the other hand, prefers to show and receive love through spending quality time together. So I've just tried to focus on spending time with him and recognize that our time together is his way of showing he loves me.



Before the move, we talked about all of the great things we were going to do in our new hometown. And now, we've been here for over a month and the only time we've spent together involves me watching him play video games.



I've also begun to feel like he's no longer attracted to me. For instance, I was away for over a week, and when I came home, he barely hugged me and I had to ask him to kiss me after being home with him for over an hour. We only have sex when I initiate it, and he won't have sex if I'm near my period or on it (my period is wack and I'm usually on it or near it most of the time). We used to have passionate sex at any time of the day, but now it's only right before bed with all of the lights off per his request. I've actually lost a good deal of weight since being with him and feel more attractive than I was in the past, but his actions seem to suggest he doesn't see me that way.



I got home last night, and he told me he's going away tomorrow to go hang out and snowboard with his friend for a couple of days. I was invited to go but don't have the funds for it so I feel sort of left behind.



When we do go out and have dates, sometimes I feel like I'm with my friend and not my boyfriend. He won't kiss me in public or show a lot of PDA, which is normal and understandable. I guess I just feel like any passion between us has totally evaporated since our move.



In the past month, we've probably had sex three to five times, and he only finishes me off if I ask him to. I've told him how I hate asking because asking someone to give you an orgasm feels extremely unsexy and really puts me in my head and makes it hard for me to enjoy sex with him. Whereas, I love making him feel good, and he's never had to ask me to go down on him.



Whenever I ask him to do something around the house or if I'm sick and need something, he indirectly makes me feel bad about it (he doesn't say anything mean just the way he acts), or doesn't do it, or tells me that it's not his turn to do X, Y, or X because he did it last.



Also, the only time he is cuddly with me is if I'm giving him a massage or scratching his back. If I don't do those things, he usually goes back to playing on his phone or doing something else.



When I've tried to communicate stuff to him in the past along these lines, he's taken it as a personal attack and acts like I'm telling him he's a shitty boyfriend. I just have so much love for him and am so attracted to him and could jump his bones all of the time if he'd let me. But lately, his actions have made me feel like I'm pining after a crush rather than in a serious relationship with the man I live with.



After not seeing him for over a week and wanting to spend time with him and be intimate with him, the fact that he's using his only days off to go and hangout with his friend just really hurts my feelings. Last night, my first night home, I felt like I was begging him to kiss me and I wanted to be with him, but he just went to sleep. He's at work until late tonight and leaving first thing tomorrow. I want to make things work so badly, and I want him to love me the way I love him. But obviously I can't make him.



I can't even remember the last time he told me I looked pretty.



Am I being selfish? How do I talk to him without him feeling like I'm attacking him? I want to make this work.



TL;DR I'm worried my relationship concerns are selfish (my bf's apparent lack of attraction towards me and lack of passion in our relationship). How do I appropriately address these issues with him?

67,"Jealousy or...


So I have a question.
My boyfriend (30m) and I (26f) just had a baby 6 weeks ago. We have been together for 15 months.For the first 6 weeks they recommend not having sex. I just went through I big event demanding my body to go through alot. When we first got home he was super helpful and amazing. After the second week things started to change. I wad trying to do my best in cleaning and cooking and watching his 4 year old when we have her. Sometimes I wouldn't wake up at 5 am to help with getting his breakfast/lunch ready and he would throw a fit. Telling me how useless I was, and how I don't appreciate what i do for him ECT
Example-thus morning I didn't wake up to help him get ready for work and he was in the kitchen yelling and throwing things telling me since the baby was asleep I should be helping him. I tried to tell him I was up with the baby every 45 mins because he had a bad night and wouldn't go to sleep. And that didn't seem to make a difference.
In those 5 weeks when we couldn't have sex he would complain how I wouldn't take care of his needs. And try to get me to have sex with him even though I told him I wasn't ready. He would accuse me of cheating on him, and/or playing with myself even though I explained to him that I wad too busy with the baby and I wasn't ready yet. At the end of the 6 weeks he got very verbally abusive and just down right jealous of the baby. I would be trying to feed our son in bed and that is when he thought it was an appropriate time to fondle me. I tried to explain that this was my time to bond with our son and I didn't want/ or felt comfortable with him doing that.
I guess my question is, is this more than jealousy? It gets much worse if I dint have sex with him for a little bit. I tried to tell him even though I am not working taking care of a new born is alot of work.
Tl;dr- what qualifies as a boyfriend being jealous of a new baby or just being abusive "

70,"I (20M) am worried about the amount of time my GF (19F) talks about her ex sexually and non sexually and her often dismissive comments of our future.


I feel like I am overall a pretty decent guy, I never start arguments and am always there for her when she has problems. I often text her good morning and good night and have scattered and given several cute personal gift mementos throughout our relationship. She is pretty needy, but besides that shes great and we get along quite well. The problem I have run into though is how often she talks about her ex boyfriend. She often claims he was a douche and she felt like he was emotionally abusing her, which I understand completely, they broke up (apparently) because of that. However, I do not understand why it has to be brought up as often as it is. For example, we had went to go grab something to eat and from a barely related topic she started talking about him and how funny this one thing was with him. She started laughing harder than I had ever seen her laugh before and it was because of him and not me. Since it is getting closer to the holidays she has said she wants to buy his mother a gift for Christmas because of all that she had done for her which I do not understand. She also has stated that he has called her before to complain about his problems. Out of maybe 5 dates that we go on, 3 of them involve him being somewhat talked about in one way or another. Whenever we get intimate and are having sex afterwards somehow he comes up as well. She talks about how big he was (10 in) and how it just hurt all the time and how I am so much better, which in my opinion is just a cover up. I do not feel like its normal for him to be even brought up at all in that situation even though it is negative. I am not uncomfortable or self-conscious but I just do not wanna hear about another dude every time we are together. In addition, she is more than 90% sure she is moving to another state for college next year and every time I mention a possible chance of us doing long distance she closes up. She says she would try, but at the same time mentions how she (supposedly) gets over guys easily and that long distance does not work in her experience, (she said her ex and her tried and she broke up with him). I just don't know what to do or what to say, I texted her earlier saying I needed to talk to her about some things, but I do not know where to go from here. Help. Me. Reddit.

 TL;DR My girlfriend often talks about her ex when shes with me sexually and non sexually, however she says shes over him. She also is very closed up about us being in a relationship long distance when she moves next year."

72,"Is it worth trying to revitalize my 5 yr marriage? He (33) just seems to do nothing but admits there are problems and I (F35) have tried to make changes/improve but now I’m doubting it’s worth it.


TL:DR  9 years together with intimacy issues and I feel like I’m the only one who has been putting out effort to figure stuff out and am feeling alone. Should I cut my losses?

We’ve been together for about 9 years, married about 5.5. Gone through lots- a parent dying, owning a business together, me going back to school and the usual things that can test a couple.  We seem to handle that stuff well. 

Overall we get along great and love to hang out. BUT our sex life is nothing like it used to be (hasn’t been for a while) and at this point his usual go-to “reason” for not being able to completely make it though a sex session doesn’t apply. He always used to lose his erection before finishing because he was “just anxious about accidentally getting me pregnant”.  But now we are settled and cool with having kids and I think there is more going on there and it is a sign of a bigger problem.  Often times getting/maintaining an erection can be difficult. If there is beverage involved, it’s definitely not gonna happen. 

Possibly it’s a personal emotional issue on his part... I’ve tried to talk with him multiple times and try to help him figure out if that’s the case but nothing comes of it. He won’t make an appointment to see a professional either  (I’ve told him we can go together if he wants, after all, takes two to tango right?) but still maintains he isn’t happy with the physical issues he seems to have. So we just end up having sex once every couple of months at best.  He does not seem open to seeing a medical doctor either to rule out a physical issue. He says he would go, but never makes an appointment. Following through is not something he often does. 

I’ve also been slowly drifting/distancing myself emotionally... not intentionally but I can feel it happening. That started when he lied repeatedly right to my face about doing dip/snuff (those tobacco pouches). I’m HUGE on honesty which I made very clear from day one and this has happened multiple times even after I tell him how much this damages my ability to trust him... I have a hard time giving back trust that somebody has broken. He knows this, but lied about this several times over a few years anyways.  Add in the emotional stress from our sex life, and after a while my way to cope is to just let myself drift. Not good, I know. 

So... I’ve tried many things to improve his confidence in the bedroom with no results hoping that might do some overall good. Meanwhile, I’ve started to think maybe it’s me that is his problem and that I’m not doing something (Is he no longer attracted to me? Just cause it’s me? Cause he’s into guys and can’t admit it to himself?- I feel desperate for SOME kind of answer) Which makes me push away more because who likes feeling and thinking that way? He said he’s noticed I’m more distant but he never takes any action, even so much as to just say something about noticing it.  It only comes out when I start a conversation about it. So I have doubts he is even seeing it. 

I’d be down to talk to a professional but if he can’t put out some effort and I have to make the appointment I know I’ll resent it.  I need to feel like he wants this to work and is as willing as I am to work for it. 

We’ve talked several times about all of this, including how I feel upset that he tells me he sees these things happening but does nothing. Makes me feel like I don’t mean enough to him to take action to save our marriage. Because that’s where I feel like it’s heading... I don’t want to have the kind of marriage and life where you are complacent and just go through the motions.  For me, that would be sentencing myself to a life of depression. I can’t do that. 

I’m open to hearing about similar experiences and ideas and appreciate  any advice you have to offer! I can be stubborn and a bit black and white about things so constructive comments are good and offer a new perspective.

73,"I [29F] am growing increasingly concerned with my ex-husbands [28M] behavior and am wondering if this situation is similar to anyone else's or if you guy have advice?


My ex-husband and I met in high school and he had a crush on me from the start. We were 15 and 16, with me being a year older than him. He asked me to be his girlfriend from the very beginning, but I said no because I was young and there was no physical attraction. Throughout the first couple of years we talked on AIM and he'd tell me stories about how abusive his father is, how he was selling drugs, blowing up meth labs (I'm not joking), getting shot on accident, how one of his relatives was a big time drug Lord and could hook him up with movie props for friend's birthday gifts and stuff (which never came through) and this seemed to be how he thought he could attract a woman. Of course these were all complete lies.

Moving on we just stayed friends and although we weren't as close he was always pretty protective and would get upset seeing me kissing a boyfriend at the time, etc.

Once we graduated from college he started asking me on very planned out, romantic dates and being extremely sweet. No more ""tough guy"" act. He'd send flowers to my work and food and was just the perfect partner. After a couple months of dating I moved to the city he was living in to be with him. I was still in the same state as our parents so it wasn't a very big move. I'm sorry if I'm being vague, but I'm trying to be as polite as I can. I can try to answer any questions you guys have in the comments.

This is when everything started to change.

He became obsessed with music and making it in the music industry. I basically started becoming invisible to him. No matter how many times I cried and tried to tell him I supported his dream, but he needed to meet me in the middle it never worked. He was never home and when he was he was in his studio working on his ""music career"" which consisted of and to this day consists of making music for friends/small time local artists/playing bass for an Austin artist.

Every day was a constant struggle with me trying to make him see how he was hurting me and I knew that he was lying to me about what he was doing, where he was and that it was making me feel like less of a person.

Yes we got engaged (after him putting it off about 5 times and even lying to me about how he was going to propose). He told me that he had hired otters to come up and give my ring. This was a complete lie. This is just the example of the outlandish lies he'd say daily.

Just to give a couple of examples of how he would treat me:

1. I have depression and I was dumb and took a full dosage of anti-depression meds instead of building up my tolerance one day and I was having suicidal thoughts. I knew that it was the medication, but I was still very scared and knew that it would be better to not be alone. I called and he was at band practice at a studio about 30 minutes away. I begged him to come home because I was scared for my life. He never showed up and told me that in his mind if I'd ended up hanging myself that him coming home wouldn't have solved anything since it's a 30 minute drive.
2. I had a miscarriage during our engagement and the day of the miscarriage (after coming home from the hospital) he didn't call off a band practice for a friend at OUR house with my upstairs bleeding and in emotional distress. He never showed any sympathy/empathy towards me and I eventually fainted upstairs from blood loss and he found me once rehearsal was over.

We got married. (Please no comments in this post about me being stupid for marrying him, etc.) It was a big, beautiful wedding and now knowing that he had zero intentions of being a husband to me it really bothers my parents, his parents and our families that he didn't just tell everyone how he really was/is? It's hard to explain.

He sat down with our fathers and promised them to take care of me and that he would put our family first and told my dad he was going to convert to Judaism. His family isn't religious, but it's very important to my dad. This isn't a big deal in itself, but he told my whole family and kept telling my father over and over again and just never even took a step to see how to convert.

I got pregnant and we announced it to our families at a dinner celebrating a raise that he had told me he'd gotten, which turned out to be a lie. This was a 20k raise and was amazing news to me, because it was always my dream to be a stay at home mom at the beginning of my children's lives. I always offered to work while pregnant and told him if he needed help I was always willing, of course. He would assure me over and over again that he was making great money at his job and about 20-30k a year doing music on the side. He told me he was working for Imagine Dragons, Maroon 5, Luke Bryan and so many more. He even told me that Interscope Records flew him out to have a meeting with the co-founder of Shady Records who wasn't even in LA that weekend. (Later when my lawyer had his bank accounts we saw he'd bought three plane tickets that weekend from three different airlines).

Our beautiful daughter was born (emergency c-section) and two days after I was home from the hospital he texted saying he was going to quit his day job. With the hormones, the surgery and just being a new mother I was completely overwhelmed. I'm so lucky my mother and his mother were there every single day for the first 3 months of our daughter's life. They cleaned, helped me, stayed up with our daughter and paid for everything. Our daughter was about 5-6 days old when he started going back on every night (first was to a concert with a buddy) and then ""working on music"". He'd stay up in his studio editing music keeping the mothers awake until the sun would come up and just had absolutely no respect for them and never said thank you.

I eventually asked about finances since he was selling off guitars and would scream at me/throw things when I'd ask to see his work contracts and wanted to get our finances together so that our daughter would be taken care of. Whenever I'd ask him to put us before music he'd scream how he was working day and night to provide for us and how ungrateful I was and would tear me down. He was incredibly emotionally abusive.

Finally I left him after I just couldn't anymore. After having my daughter I knew that she deserved better and so did I. I'd become a shell of the person I was when I had started dating him and I felt that if I stayed I would literally end up dying in that house. I told him that I was leaving and going to stay with my parents the next day.

I did and he actually texted me saying, ""You really left?"" because he didn't think I'd actually get up the strength to leave. I never looked back, I have a great job and my daughter and I are surrounded by family and love. His parents and I have a great relationship. He isn't allowed to take our daughter overnight. His mother has to be with her and I'm so thankful for this and I didn't even ask for it.

We got divorced and even during the mediation he put on a show crying to the mediator telling her he didn't want the divorce when my attorney and I could see he'd been out drinking and partying the night before. I found out so many more financial lies during the mediation and divorce. I learned that he didn't pay a cent for our daughter's birth while he'd go around bragging to his friends about paying 60k for her birth and my hospital stay. He had credit cards with thousands of dollars of debt in his name, because he was so lazy the debt added up over the years. He was paying about $300-500 in just overdraft fees EVERY MONTH because his accounts were always empty.

Our parents paid for EVERYTHING for our daughter so where was his money going? It wasn't going to me. It wasn't going to our daughter. I have no idea. His accounts show partying and a lot of Venmos to himself? His salary ended up being 50k than what he'd been telling me throughout our ENTIRE relationship of 5-6 years. He still insists he's getting a 40k raise, but every month it's ""next month"".

I know that I left so much out, but I'm just worried about his continuous lies about his financial situation, his ""music career"" that he chose over his family, and his complete disregard for anyone's feelings but his own. He wasn't always like this and it's almost like he's a complete stranger. He rarely sees our daughter. He lies to me about when he's coming in to see her on his parent's weekends with her (saying he'll come down Friday night when his mother will say he'll be coming in Sunday night). Everyone is constantly having to baby him and work around his schedule, because of his lack of communication and just the lies about times. He tells people he's high up in the music industry and doesn't have our daughter on his social media much because it's not cool to have a kid.

I'm legitimately concerned about his health and it's exhausting co-parenting with someone who is continuously lying to me about what he's doing/sending me/his job/everything and who doesn't even want to be a dad, but won't admit it because he cares about his self image.

I want my daughter to have her father in her life, but I also don't want him treating her like he's treated his mother, my mother and me. I don't want her to think she's not important just because her dad is living in this weird fantasy world where he's a huge music producer and nobody else understands.

Does this sound like anyone you've ever known? I'm at a complete loss.

Any advice/constructive criticism would help.

I know the story is long so I'll answer any questions in the comments.

TL/DR: I've had a very long and complicated relationship with my now ex-husband and his behavior has been worrying me for years, but now that I have a daughter, who is my life, I'm wondering if anyone knows a person like him and if they have any advice. The last couple of years our relationship became very emotionally abusive (I give 2 examples above and was beginning to get physically abusive). It almost seems like his reality is completely different from ours. He's very important in the music industry and doesn't see the incredibly big debt he's burying himself in and just continues to lie to everyone around him without feeling sorry at all.

This is my first post here, so I'm so sorry if I messed up anything. I'll edit if I need to and add anything you guys want to know. If you've read this far thank you SO SO much."
74,"Ex (30F) is moving back to country after many years, am I (33m) being an idiot?


 We got together very young (16/18) and it was a very intense if awesome relationship that lasted around 3 years (VERY on/off, we were constantly splitting and getting back together towards the end). Some things about it are pretty weird now I think back, like the fact that I pretty much moved in with her and her mum while she was still in school and I was working a 9-5.

&amp;#x200B;

Anyway, fast forward to now. I broke off an engagement about this time last year, she has been living abroad with her bf for around 6 years, we haven't seen each other properly for around 10 years. She posted on a pic on FB asking if the poster of the pic or I were around at xmas (tagged me).

&amp;#x200B;

I DMed her and we have ended up chatting A LOT over the last week. All sorts of stuff; what went wrong with my engagement, what is going wrong with her current relationship, how she is having no sex, how our sex life used to be awesome, things that went wrong with us, how we were too young to deal at the time, what was excellent about us.

&amp;#x200B;

Thing is even though this was absolutely years ago I've never really stopped thinking about her and the situation. Tbh its the relationship I compare other relationships to, both in terms of trying to avoid that kind of intensity (to avoid the pain when it fucks up) but also I don't think I've ever really felt like that about anyone since.

&amp;#x200B;

So we've been talking about meeting up when she is back (some very flirtatious stuff about it too), but here's the rub. Shes still abroad living with her current boyfriend, who she has told that they will have to split up when she comes back, but it doesn't seem like he is really hearing it, keeps talking about the future etc.

&amp;#x200B;

I can feel myself getting pulled into this and I haven't even seen the girl for a decade, am I being a complete fool? She's obviously going to have a load of shit to deal with moving back after 6 years, but also I know how long it takes to get over something you've been in for that long. Seems like she is starved of nookie and will be wanting some of that when she comes back, but she is also talking about how great we were and how she misses things about the way we used to be etc etc. I can tell from the chats that she is still the same person and we will definitely get on and have fun.

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR

My ex from when I was very young is moving back to the country after being abroad for years. We have started talking again and I am getting quite wrapped up in the idea of getting back together in some way. Am I being an idiot?"
75,"Me [16 M] with my Girlfriend [17 F] of A year; I feel like I am starting to not be able to relate to her anymore


TLDR; Over the past 2 months me and my girlfriend have been getting distant and I feel like I’m unable to relate to her sometimes.

So, all of this started a couple months ago, My girlfriend isn‘t a bad person at all, if anything she is the exact opposite. She is nice, caring and loving, Does everything I‘d ever want but I just feel like I might be losing interest in her in some ways.

For example, my girlfriend is applying for colleges and she got into a pretty good college in my area over here in Ohio, She was texting me about how proud she felt and how she was crying because she was so unbelievably happy and what not. But...I just really didn’t feel anything, like I felt proud and happy that a good college accepted her and what not but I just didn’t know what to say or do. On top of all of this i am in a JROTC program (Yes, make fun of me as you will) and i have been kinda stressed out the past couple of weeks with all of the people I gotta train and my job is getting in the way of all that.

I assume it would be pretty important to note that we also have been fighting a little bit recently. It definitely has been getting a lot better but it really hasn’t fully healed if that makes sense. Some of the things we fought about is how im not getting enough time for myself and friends and how I proposed that we just stop spending time at each other‘s houses so often. There are some other things that we fight about too but they are pretty sensitive topics and I‘d rather not give out that information at this time. 

Now I am in no way wanting to break up with her, like I said she is amazing but I just want to know how I can improve myself and not feel this way and if y’all need me to elaborate on things i happily will. Any and all feedback is appreciated

(I‘m Sorry if this might have been all over the place, this is my first post on reddit in general so I apologize if it is pretty bad. Like I said before, if you need more information, just tell me)

76,"My (22F) best friend (23M) is getting married, but will not have me in his wedding because his fiance (20F) hates me.


So some background. My best friend D and I have been best friends since middle school. We dated for a week in middle school, but you know how middle school relationships are, I don't think we ever actually hugged during that week. After that I moved to multiple different schools but always kept in contact with D. My family loves him, he helps my family at their business, text both my mom and dad happy birthday every year. Even when I went to college 1600 miles away we talked at least once a week and he sent be care packages. I have a hard time opening up to people, but because we have been friends  for so long I am comfortable telling him things I wouldn't tell others about my mental health or relationships. He is my best friend and the brother I never had. He has also told me I am his best friend and regularly vents to me about problems at work or his depression.

&amp;#x200B;

Current day. About a year ago D started seeing a girl, M. I was over the moon for him. It had been awhile since he dated someone and he seemed  to really like her. I was dating a guy at the time and wanted to go on a double date with the two of them so I could meet M. Well when I did finally meet her, it was awkward to say the least. She was kind of cold to me and almost acted threatened by me, even though I was dating someone at the time. I tried to be friendly with her and even cut back on my closeness with D to make her feel better. I moved away again for about 8 months, but still always made sure to ask D about how him and M were. Now I am back home again, and dating a new guy. D and I both plan double date type things for us all to do and it is always fun, but even D admits that M is not very comfortable with me and  sees me as a threat. He recently bought her a ring to propose, I was one of two people he told about his plan and I was very excited for him. He proposed, she said yes and now they are planning the wedding. When I asked D about being in his wedding party, he told me honestly I probably wouldn't be in his wedding party because his exact words ""it's her wedding"" and she wouldn't be very happy about it. I am more disappointed that I thought I would be. Growing up we always said we were going to have each other in our wedding party and always joked around about him wearing a dress and me wearing a suit.

So I guess I am asking, am I right in feeling hurt that he isn't even going to fight for me to be in his wedding party when we have been each others best friends for years? Should I just suck it up and be happy for him and M?

TL;DR: Best friend won't let me in is wedding party because his fiance feels threatened by me and in his words ""it's her wedding""."

78,"I [22M] got ghosted by my girlfriend [22F] on thanksgiving


Title about sums it up. I apologize if this is not the right place to post this I just need to get this off my chest. tl/dr at the bottom.

So I got asked out by a girl [22F] that I met at a store and we had coffee the next day. The date went great and she was really sweet and we hit it off and continued to go out for over a month. In this time she asked me to have dinner with her family and I did and everything went great with that too. It was perfect and she seemed to really like me and that she was taking it seriously. 

Then thanksgiving happened. I was at my grandparents and she was with her family. During the dinner my grandma asked if I had a picture of my girlfriend so I pulled up her Facebook to show her and I saw she had unfriended me. I thought this was weird because we had talked on the phone just a few days before and she seemed fine and was laughing and we just had a normal conversation and everything was fine. So I sent her a text asking if she had unfriended me and she left me on read. So I waited a bit and asked if everything was ok and what was going on and she left me on read again. Now it was thanksgiving so I thought maybe she was just busy and she’d get back to me later but she still hadn’t by 9:00 so I tried calling and it just rang until I got her voicemail so I just sent another text asking if we could talk. Again, she left me on read. At this point it was pretty obvious that she wasn’t going to respond so I gave it a few days and tried to text her again asking what was going on and of course, again, I was left on read. I tried calling and it only rang once and then went to voicemail which generally means that your number is blocked. At this point I stopped trying to reach out because I didn’t want to come across as pushy and it was pretty obvious that she had ghosted me. 

Tonight I had to go to the same store she works at to get some stuff for a project. I didn’t go there to talk because that seems like something a stalker would try and I didn’t expect to even see her because lots of people work there but I did see her when I was checking out and she just walked away and went to the back so I bought my stuff and left like I planned too anyway and went home.

Nothing happened that gave me even an inkling that she was unhappy or that anything at all was wrong. It completely took me by surprise. I’m pretty torn up about it.

Why would she want me to have dinner with her family if she was just going to ghost me? Am I being stupid and missing something? I’m so confused. It wasn’t like it was some casual things. I met her parents and she met mine. I met her friends. It just doesn’t make sense.....

tl/dr:

I dated a girl for over a month and we had dinner with each others families and it was a serious thing then she ghosted me with no warning at all and I have no idea what happened.

I never thought she would ghost me even if we did break up. I always thought I’d at least get a phone call."
79,"How do I [32F] nicely back away from this guy [36M] who is getting too attached to me?


Throwaway because I think he knows my main account. I'm somewhat recently single, it's been about 2-3 months and I'm getting back into meeting people slowly. I met a guy at a house party recently and we had a brief conversation, but a friend of mine then told me he had a girlfriend, so I dismissed him as something to explore.

&amp;#x200B;

However, him and his girlfriend then broke up. Apparently it was a long time coming, I don't know much about it. Not long after, he sent me a message on facebook and we started talking, then hanging out. We've kissed a couple of times but we're not exactly dating because it's so incredibly soon. We have a really nice time together and there's a very mutual attraction.

&amp;#x200B;

But! We're completely different people. In lots of big ways, we have different life goals, different life experiences... our values line up but there are lots and lots of things that don't. We don't even like the same music, books or films. When we hang out we mainly talk about politics and our lives, as you do when you're getting to know each other, but I've no idea how we'll spend time together in the future since the activities we enjoy are so misaligned.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm also just sort of finding myself. I spent a lot of my life in relationships and I'm now in counselling to work on why I pick unsuitable men (ironically). As much as being around someone is lovely, I kind of want to just work on myself.

&amp;#x200B;

The problem is, he's getting attached. I can feel it. He insists he's fine but when we're together he's very touchy feely and quite romantic, doing cute stuff like hugging me from behind and rubbing noses together. It's fun, but I feel like he's latching onto me emotionally following his breakup. I tried to have a conversation with him about it and he insisted that wasn't what was happening. But his actions say otherwise.

&amp;#x200B;

I like him a lot and I don't want to hurt him, but I feel like it's just a bad situation waiting to happen. That we'd probably get a good three to six months out of it and then it'll implode. But I don't know how to say that. I tried, and he just went all reassuring and said we'll just see how things go.

&amp;#x200B;

There's an added complication in that we're both part of a local activism group I just joined and I want us to stay at least civil because I would have to see him all the time. I know that's a bit selfish but I really don't want to stomp on his feelings just to get this over with, then have us both feel awkward about being around each other.

&amp;#x200B;

Please reddit, what do I say that'll end things calmly and with minimal fuss? I know some hurt feelings are inevitable but I want to get across that it's more about me and how I feel about my life than him. I don't want him to feel horribly rejected.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

**tl;dr:** Started hanging out with a guy, very attracted to him but we have completely different lives and I don't think he's who I want to be with despite how nice it is to be around him. How do I tell him this without having an argument?

80,"My [19M] girlfriend [18F] photoshops pictures of me before showing them


You read the title. It makes me feel as pathetic as it sounds. 

I found out recently that when my girlfriend’s friends who haven’t met me ask what I look like, she sends them photoshopped pics of me. I saw this on her laptop when she forgot to log out of discord and noticed that my pic looked kind of weird. I compared it to the version on my phone and noticed that she whitened my teeth, evened my skin, changed my face and eye shape slightly and adjusted my hair color... at least, probably more things that I couldn’t pick up on. I looked through her other group chats and found a few more. 

We’ve only been together for a month so I don’t know how many other people who haven’t met me have asked for these pictures. I don’t know if I’m being overdramatic and feel like a loser asking real life friends for advice on this.

82,"F25 dating bf M26 and we seem to be thinking differently about the next step in our relationship. Is it me?


Hi all!

To begin I i have been dating my bf for almost 5 years now.  We had ups and downs but we worked through it.  This past year and a half has been challenging since I decided to go to grad school. We drifted apart a little due to lack of quality time since I was working full time and was a full time student.

We had a huge fight where we almost broke it off because we were unhappy at how distant we had become and such.  We talked it out and decided to communicate better and work through our rough patch.

We love each other so much but here's where I'm at.
He likes to talk about the present and feels the future is too much pressure right now.  He is finishing school in the summer and works part time at the moment.  

I talked to him about where I'm at and how I would like to have a future with him and he looked overwhelmed.  He says he never said he didn't want a future with me but also hasn't said he does. 

He also is feeling pressured at school and work and is feeling like he does not know where he should go career wise.

I told him we can regroup when he is done with school and go from there.  


Tl;dr 5 years in a relationship and he seems not to be thinking into the future. He has pressure from school and work that he wants to figure out first.  Am I being hopeful because of what we've been through? Does he no longer see me in his future?

 I'm just all over the place , I would like to be supportive but also do I let go and move on?

Do you think divorce messes you up, just a tiny bit, even though you don't really notice it and it's all very much in the past?

I feel we're both sensitive and struggling to get past dating, probably a little scarred. My (f) divorce was amicable and is over, his was less so and is still ongoing. We haven't really talked about moving it forward, I don't think either of us knows how to even though we have been perfectly capable in the past with other people. 

For me, I think it's fear of going 'all in' again, I think, or maybe giving up living alone and the ownership of self I have become in my own person. I don't know... I'd love some experiences and stories. We've been together 2 years, we say we want it to work, we don't know how to. Are we too protective of ourselves? I feel I want to feel more together, but that takes the both of us to do, not just him or me.

I'm not scared of being alone, that is one thing I know for sure.

85,"Are my(38F) boundaries regarding estranged sibling (36M) unreasonable?


My brother and I aren't on good terms. We don't keep in touch and I do not want a relationship with him. 

I live with our father in a bit of a caretaker role. It works out very well most of the time. But one point he keeps pushing me about is the relationship with my brother. I think I've got reasonable boundaries about it. I have no problem being polite and civil when brother visits. What I do object to is being asked to chauffer him around town and being pressured to spend time with him. He knows how to drive, he's welcome to use our car or rent his own. I don't feel theres any reason why I should be expected to play driver for him. As for spending time with him... I just have better things to do than listen to him criticize every part of my life.

But our father is upset about it and its causing dissent between us. He thinks I'm trying to antagonize my brother, not understanding its that I'm trying to protect myself. I've been told for years to suck it up and be the bigger person and I'm just done with it. But my fathers insistence on arguing with me about it has me doubting my decisions. 

tl;dr Don't want to spend time with visiting sibling. Have some reasonable(?) boundaries in place about it. But arguments with father have me doubting myself."

87,"She [F 21] lead me on [M 20] for months, how best can i go on?


TL:DR  she lead me to believe that we were going somewhere for months and now i've found out she's been leading me on. How can i move on.

If you look at my account and see my last post on this sub (which was only yesterday), then this is gonna be really cringe. I expect this to be top post on r/sadcringe within the hour.

&amp;#x200B;

If you didnt see the last post, then basically i found someone a couple of months ago who i got along with amazingly well. She said she cared for me and that shed never got on with someone as well as she has with me. I felt the same way. I told her i liked her and she basically said not yet, because she takes time to trust people and wants things to happen naturally. Even when i said to her that i think she doesn't like me in that way and that we arent going to go into a relation ship, she made sure to say that she never said that and we're getting there. she even said once ""we would make a good relationship. were building our way to that"".

&amp;#x200B;

Well today her friend texted me to say that she doesnt want to go anywhere and that she has been leading me on this whole time. She said that she hadnt been doing it on purpose and was confused, and that she feels really bad about it. Her friend told me that she still apparantly really cares about me and really wants to be close friends. Her friend has wanted to say something for a while and has told her that she should stop. 

&amp;#x200B;

I don't know what to do. I still really like her and care for her. I want to be friends with her because when we just friends we did really get along, but i know it will hurt me being with her. I dont want to waste a really good friendship, but i know i probably should just let her go. Moreover, I find it really hard to meet people and I worried I wont ever find anyone else, at least who i like as much as i like my friend now. How can i move on, what should i do to get over it?

89,"Should I [24M] just be frank about how I feel towards my friend [27F], these awkward baby steps towards an actual relationship are getting weird.


So every time I doubt my feelings for my friend, I immediately know that I more than like my friend and I keep digging myself more emotionally deeper.  We’ve known each other for a while but it wasn’t appropriate for use to be involved, so we‘ve been playing footsie for the better part of a year, mostly because I have low self esteem. Now I know she’s poly, this makes things difficult for me as a poly noob. I’ve met them all several times, and I can’t even irrationally hate them because she has the same taste in people.

We get along great, make fun of each other, are completely open and honest.  I’m just a little self conscious because she’s gorgeous and I’m sorta average looking. Every time I see her I learn something else about her that makes me like her even more or notice something that i hadn’t seen. Yesterday i noticed her dimples every time she smiled and I just wanted to bite off her cheeks.

It’s always awkward when we say goodbye.  It’s always an awkward hug, rushed peck in the cheek, if we’re alone.
She almost always asks me 3 or 4 times if I want to come in for coffee or water.

So we planned what i could only describe as a romantic trip together, date to be decided. 

Now she suggested that the trip that was gonna happen next year, happen at Christmas and we should try and go then.  She seemed really excited.

This just feels too weird. 

TL;DR:  I’m confused as to what i should do to tell my friend about how I feel or head off our vacation before anything happens.  Please read the entire message if you want to comment too complicated to sum up in tldr.

92,"Am I [28M] being selfish with her [25F]?


We're engaged to be married in one and a half weeks. She's also 3 months pregnant. In spite of anything I might be feeling now, I love her, very much.

&amp;#x200B;

However, during the last few weeks sex has been very hard to come by. Once a week or something. We use to do it every day, then every other day and now it's down to once a week, if I'm lucky.

I struggle with it a lot since I think she's the hottest thing to have ever existed, so I get turned on every day. And she provokes me at every corner, so it's not like she ain't doing nothing.

&amp;#x200B;

I was getting a lot of ""no"" for a few days before I stopped doing anything at all. Well, yesterday I tried to initiate something and I got another ""no"". I got so frustrated. She has time for massage, gym, she dresses up in skin tight (sometimes inappropriate clothing) for work, wear make up, told me once that every guy in her workplace looks at her butt, and when it comes to me it feels like she just doesn't care. Just provokes me and leaves me hanging. It's beginning to feel like she's more of a room-mate who says ""I love you"" a lot rather than a romantic partner.

&amp;#x200B;

Am I being selfish here? Should I just let her be? I feel selfish by wanting sex..

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR: Sex with my 3 months pregnant fiance went down from every day to maybe once a week. I got a 'no' yesterday that struck me hard. She has time for massage, gym, be friendly and borderline flirty to every guy in her office and when it comes to me she just provokes me and leaves me hanging. I feel selfish for wanting to have sex with her. Should I let her be?"
