0,"Finally stood up to abusive husband


Throwaway account as my sister in law lives on reddit. Me 30F finally got a back bone and stood up to my 32M husband. Long story so bare with me please.

We’ve been together for 6 years, married for 2. Everything was fine for the first 3 years. We met at work where I was an an intern, he was a manager. He was so sweet and really supportive of my ambitions and goals as I was of his and we clicked right away. We began dating and as time went on, I started climbing the ladder at my job and on our third year together, I was offered a managing director position....that’s when everything went south.

When I was offered the position. I was over the moon, having been an intern on close to nothing , climbing my way up to a position where I’d earn more than enough money to look after both him and I and our future meant so much to me. When I told him, I thought he would be ecstatic especially as he has proposed to me a month prior and I had said yes, it was a great way to earn more money for the wedding and a house.

His responses was lacklustre and he said oh okay, I’ll have to think about how I feel about this, turned around and walked out the door and left me for over a week. Wouldn’t respond to my messages or calls. I was beyond sick and worried, I thought something had happened to him. He finally came back, over a week later (hadn’t shown up at work either) strolls in like nothing happened and says, If you take this job, I’m leaving you. I was shocked and tried to talk about it about it but he said his feelings were final.

Like an idiot, I declined the job because I didn’t want to lose him. He once again become sweet again and even though I wasn’t earning as much, we were still together. A few months down the track and he starts being critical of my appearance and mental state. He says I’ve put on weight and should be focused on doing more around the house and working out and he isn’t happy with our “average” sex life. This throws me for a 6 but I oblige and start working 9-5, getting up at 6 to go to the gym to lose the 10 pounds I had put on off , cleaning the house before I went to work, coming home and cooking every night and then trying to get more adventurous and sexy for him to spice things up.

I’m exhausted by this, meanwhile he goes to work 4 days a week, does no cleaning, plays video games and criticises every meal I cook. I really start losing self esteem at this point and start feeling depressed. He takes it upon himself to talk to my boss behind my back and then I end up having a meeting where my boss says, I think you’re putting too much stress on yourself and we’d like you to take some time off. I was stressed and exhausted but work was the only place where I could escape. Even though it felt like shit, I decided to take some time off. While I was having time off my husband manipulated my work and kept telling me that I’m not of Sound mind, that I’m hopeless, that I’m a wreck and should quit my job. I told him no but he barraged me 24/7 and told me that there’d be no wedding.....we had already paid for 75% of it and some of that was a gift from my parents, I was scared of letting them down so in the end I relented.


Well we got married, I thought I could be happy but I was the shell of a woman I once was. Jobless, in a constant state of fear of what else he’d say was wrong with me. He took my phone, limited my internet time, isolated me and made me believe I could only depend on him and that I wasn’t worth anything.

The last year has been hell, all I’ve wanted to do is sleep my life away, although I would t dare in fear of his retaliation, instead I spent my day cleaning and cooking, doing everything he wanted and yet he’d tell me I was ugly and stupid and would just demand sex because the least I could do was get him off.

I felt like a used puppet purely there to satisfy him and not be a full person. Fast forward to a few weeks ago, I found out I was pregnant, what should’ve been the happiest moment of my life, scared me to death. Some of you may judge me for this but it shook me to the core. I thought about this for a few days , didn’t tell him but decided to secretly abort. I was devastated, I want to be a mom but I couldn’t imagine subjecting a child to this life. I was numb for a while, I just continued on with everything until a few days ago. 

It hit me like a train, he was so abusive in such a manipulative way. I had given up so much of me to make him happy, I had aborted a child because deep down inside, I knew he is a piece of shit.

I found my car keys that he had hidden and my phone. I found a divorce lawyer, called up my old boss, I went to work, I marched in and said to my boss that I’d like my job back. He asked how my husband would feel about it and I said, I don’t care, I know I’m good at what I do and I need the money to leave him. My boss clapped his hands and said welcome back and that the whole team would support me coming back into the work force.

My husband obviously had gotten home by this point and noticed my phone and car was missing, started blowing it up, sending me disgusting messages and telling me to get home now. 

I went home. I walked in, he started yelling and telling me that I’ve abused his trust by stealing “my property” without running it by him, that I should be ashamed. I told him that he can get fucked, we’re over, I’m leaving him and he’ll be hearing from my lawyer. He immediately started crying hysterically and begged me to stay, that we should work things out , I told him that all of these years I thought it was me who was lacking, but thanked him because it was because of that lie that he kept telling me that made me realise, I’m not lacking, I’m an educated, smart, intelligent person, I said but you knew that already, instead of celebrating me, you became insecure and tried to diminish who I was to make yourself feel better. I told him he was right to feel that way, I am better than him and that you can’t polish a fucking turd and walked out, blocked him on all social media, notified all of our friends and family and I’ve never felt better.


I’m really looking forward to 2019!

TDLR: me 30F finally got a back bone against 32m Abusive husband had made me feel like nothing for years, I finally stood up to him and realised my worth.
"
1,"My 33F stepdaughter's 17F boyfriend 18M pushed me down the stairs. She continues to want to date him.


So I have been married to husband for 2yrs. My stepdaughter and I get along pretty well. 

She started dating 18M who was a dirt bag, didnt like it or him. Me and husband expressed concerns but ultimately it is her life/choices. He showed up to our house (17F lives with us) really drunk at 1 AM. I asked him nicely to go sleep in the guest room or I call the cops. He pushes me down a flight of stairs. 

Husband calls cops, and stepdaughter runs to defense of boyfriend. A few weeks later she says she still wants to be with him, it's my fault he shoved me down the steps, and that I need to apologize. Me and husband told her if she feels that way then she cant live with us. We told her mom (husbands ex wife) what happened and she promptly turned off her daughters cell phone service. Now my stepdaughter is demanding I pay for her phone (she is off her nut). 

Are we being fair for wanting to kick her out? Unreasonable? 

Tldr: Stepdaughters BF pushed me down a flight of stairs. She is in defense of BF. "
2,"I [22 F] love my boyfriend [24 M] but I'm afraid he will never love me to the same degree.


So this isn't in response to a specific thing, but it's just this looming fear that I have.

We are each other's first serious relationship and we've been together for 6 years.

My relationship started with infatuation from my side. I even told my boyfriend ""I love you"" after a month, and he responded with ""I know."" He says I love you now but I can't even remember the first time he said it.

A year ago I asked him what song he'd want to dance to at our wedding and it made him extremely uncomfortable. He said the idea of getting married to me felt like he was closing off his options, like he'll never be able to back out of the relationship. And all of that stems from him not knowing what 'love' feels like. And what if he's right? He thinks love is that desire to fawn over someone. Well, he's never done that to me. 

He's kind and giving, and he misses me when he's away. But I just get this feeling that he loves me because I'm familiar. And I feel guilty because what if there's someone else in the world that he'd actually be passionate about? 

Is love over hyped and over emphasized? We have similar interests and life goals, and we're attracted to each other. We make each other laugh and we like to be affectionate to each other.

I want my boyfriend to be in my future, and I'd sacrifice almost anything to make him happy. That's the extent of my passion.

Is there something missing? Is there some ultimate passion that only a 'soul mate' can provide?

TL;DR My boyfriend loves me but he's not passionately in love and never has been. Is this a fundamental problem?"
3,"My Brother [21] has changed into an aggressive person you can’t talk to since he wants to get married.


So my brother has a relationship with a girl for 2 years now. They met at college and study psychology together. 
She is his first GF and they have a really intense relationship. They are together at uni everyday and when they’re home they facetime till they go to sleep. If we sit around table for dinner he always is texting, doesn’t join our conversation. If mom or dad makes an comment about that, he gets mad, sometimes he leaves.
He told us that he wants to marry her. In our culture weddings are a very big thing with many people and huge costs also there hast to be a henna night.
2017 my sister got married and my dad paid everything. He still repays the loans. I married last month but our wedding party will be in april. My husband and I work ourselves and will pay everything on our own but still there are some traditions my parents want to be continued and they are about money.  So my dad asked my brother to get a job to make savings. He told us that he can’t work while he studies. Then my dad suggested him to wait one or two years so he can save for his wedding. Brother didn’t agree and said he doesn’t want to wait that long. He was angry and yelled. My dad is worried but he said so let’s meet her and her family for making a start. We did and everything was ok, very kind people.
Before we went, my brother told us how we have to be or what we should talk or not talk. 
He acts like he is ashamed of his family. 
He says that it’s his turn to marry, because their relationship started earlier than my husbands and mine. He thinks it’s unfair. I told him he can marry whenever he want and that I would support him but that the difference is my husband and me working our asses off for our wedding, our home and our future, while he is expecting my parents to pay everything. He said that I’d piss him off and went to his room. He doesn’t talk to me since then. 
It makes me sad, because he wasn’t like that. We had a nice relationship, he was the one I could talk to for hours about everything. We spent nights together talking about the world and stuff. Since he has this marriage idea i rarely see him even if we live in the same house. 
He is so agressive. I don’t know how to handle this situation and how to make things getting better because I’m hurt but worried about him at the same time.

tl;dr Brother acts aggressive to family and doesn’t spend time with us since he wants to get married and wants my parents to pay for it."
4,"How do I (30f) diplomatically ask my husband (33m) to stop smoking while his job is on the line?


My husband and I live in a state where marijuana is only legal for medical purposes, but my husband uses it to treat his anxiety. He has had really awful reactions to every prescribed medication so this helps.

Recently, he's been having trouble at his job. He is truly a hard worker, but he is in a sales position and I honestly think him being nice is hurting his position. For example, if some old lady comes in and says her furnace is broken, he will assess the whole system and say, ""we recommend you also update the filters and schedule a cleaning but this service is the bare minimum to fix your problem.""

So he doesn't upsell unless it's a very willing one, he'll occasionally have people who say sure why not. But management doesn't like that and said his numbers need to be up or he's out.

So his anxiety is through the roof and he's smoking more. But if he gets fired he'll need to start applying right away for jobs, and that will require testing.

I am working full time and am the ""breadwinner"" but he recently bought a new car so I don't have the finances to cover rent and a car payment if he loses his job. I personally think he should be looking up other vocations while this is in question because it doesn't seem like a good fit for him.

How do I say that while I sympathize, I know his anxiety will only be worse if he's fired and can't get a job for over a month because he isn't ""clean""?


**TL;DR: Husband smokes pot and is likely to have to job search soon, how do I ask him to stop now so he is ""clean"" when the time comes?**"
5,"My [27F] friend/roommate [28M] is extremely irritable since taking Vyvanse....can I/ Should I say something??


My best friend and one of my roommates was diagnosed with ADD and prescribed Vyvanse last year. Thanks to the medication he is incredibly focused, driven but he is VERY irritable. He is also seeing a therapist and has mentioned to me that they are working on him ""standing up for himself"" more than he used to. I am very supportive of that and want him to feel better about himself and not feel that he gets pushed around. BUT there's a difference between standing up for yourself and being a complete dick.

For the past 3-4 months I feel like I am walking on eggshells around him, I don't feel like I can bring the tiniest things to his attention about our home's cleanliness (in fear of him snapping at me ). I did not even think about the Vyvanse being the culprit until our other roommate brought it to my attention. Part of me is glad that it might just be the Vyvanse and not that he became a total asshole overnight.

I have experienced my fair shares of him snapping at me over the smallest things and I have become accustomed to it and began to think I probably deserved it....However, the final straw was a few days ago when I overheard a conversation he has having with someone else in which he was being a DICK. This is not like my friend at all, he is caring, kind, loving, funny and one of the best people I have ever met.

We are very close so I know that I can talk to him about it. Maybe he needs to lower his dosage or try another type of med. I am by no means very well educated in this subject so that is why I am looking for help/advice on how to communicate my concerns with him without him feeling attacked.

Ty!

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR: MY BFF/ROOMMATE HAS BECOME A DICK SINCE TAKING VYVANSE, HOW DO I APPROACH THE SITUATION WITHOUT HIM FEELING ATTACKED?"
6,"Can being honest with your feelings, thoughts, and opinions be perceived as clingy?


Tl;dr: I've been dating this girl for 4 months and things have been going really really good. We've both already reached and passed the point where we are able to share our feelings/opinions comfortably without the fear of being judged by the other person. My question is: where do you draw the line? 

I feel there are obviously things that we should just simply keep to ourselves sometimes. My girlfriend has stressed many times in the past that listening to my feelings and concerns makes her happy. I've been trying to open myself up more often, but I'm worried that if I give too much away she'll eventually find me clingy and get bored.

I'd also like to stress that I can't remember a time where she has voluntarily shared her feelings with me FIRST. Our talks generally start with me asking her for one, or more often than not she would confront me when she senses that something isn't right. During these talks we've had however she's shared a lot about her with me as well. I don't mind taking initiative, I just simply wonder whether this is normal, or perhaps she hasn't completely opened up to me after all. She's shy about this kind of stuff so maybe that could be a contributing factor as well?"
7,"My Controlling and Abusive Girlfriend(21F) dumped and cheated on me(24M) I am an emotional wreck and need to move on


I'm  sorry if this is a lengthy long post but I need a third party opinion on this.(NAMES of people ARE CHANGED).

I am 24 and live and work on Long Island my now Ex-GF is 21 year old Senior who goes to school in SUNY ALBANY.

**Back story:** My now EX GF and I have known each other for many years our families are very close with each other. She and I have been hooking up on and Off and having sex for the past few years and have always liked each other. We didn’t date at first because she was still in high school and I was in college plus the age difference. I never loved anyone like this girl and couldn’t believe I couldn't like someone so much. Our official relationship began over the summer near the end of July. We rarely fought and had great sex and our families were very happy we were finally together. We’ve talked for many years about getting married and having kids.

However, there were some red flags that I ignored early on because I was in such love with her.She constantly talked about her ex-boyfriends(Matt and Garrick) she went to school with and it kinda annoyed me. She was very controlling and made me not use social media such as Instagram and delete all girls even friends off my Snapchat. She made me also stop hanging out and talking with one of my best friends who was a girl who was basically my sister. I agreed to all this because I loved her and was under her spell. While I would post her on my social media such as facebook and Instagram. She did not put up a single post of me. I asked her why she's like i'm gonna wait to the school semi-formal to post you and no one has to know my business. She also is going through lots of difficulty with her family. Her father used to be a major lawyer but now is a struggling drug addict in and out of jail. Her mother is struggling to make ends meat to send her and her sister to school and pay her mortgage. I know this a bad situation but she would use it against me to get her way always with things.

When she left for school in late August, I felt everything was fine with our relationship. We shared each other locations so I know where she was. She is president of her sorority and would go to lots of fraternity parties and mixers on weekends. Most nights her location showed she made it back home. Other nights she would sleep downtown were the parties where. I bought up my concern to her once. She said she slept at her roommates cousins Johnnies house. I joked saying did You sleep on the couch and she got mad at me saying she needed space for the rest of the day. I didn’t ask her again when she slept downtown because I didn’t wanna anger her more. Another night she posted a Snapchat story of her kissing a guy on the cheek. This upset me I told her to take it down. She told me she wanted space again and called me controlling. One night I was facetiming her late at night and one of her ex-boyfriends Matt hits her up to have sex and come over. I tell her to tell him she is dating me and to tell him to get lost. She's like I don't wanna be that girl who tells everyone I have a boyfriend and she told me not to worry shes done with him. Later one that night I check her location because I had my suspicions and she was not at her apartment. I checked she was at a upper class-man and grad student housing complex. I then call her and she didn't answer and she freaked out on me. She made up the excuse she was visiting her little sister who was having an anxiety attack and didn't wanna be at school . But I also had her sisters location on snap maps and she was at her freshman dorm .35 miles away when I calculated the distance on google maps. and Told me her ex boyfriend Matt lived at another student housing complex on the other side of campus and I was acting crazy and didn't trust her. She wanted space from me for the next 3 days and didnt start talking to me again until I got her sister from the train on Long Island and took her home.

My girlfriend came home towards the end of September for her sisters boyfriends father party and it was clear going to back to school changed her alot. She felt like she was better and cooler than me in some way and was acting suspicious at the party. she went upstairs at one point and saw her taking selfies in the mirror. I grab her phone and saw that on her snapchat she was frequently sending snaps to this guy George who I knew she had a thing with. She made up the excuse that he was gay and she didn't speak to me for the rest of the party. We had sex later on that night and she assured to me we were exclusive and I had nothing to worry about.

Around mid October I haven’t seen her in over almost month and asked if I could visit her. She said no she didn’t want me invading her life up there. Also she gave some B.S excuse that I probably didn't want her to visit me when I was in undergrad. I should’ve broke up with her then but didn’t because I loved her for so long and was going to see her on thanksgiving. And she said she was going to let me come up to formal at the end of the semester.(UPDATE: ENDS UP GOING TO FORMAL in DEC WITH ANOTHER GUY IN THE DRESS I BOUGHT HER LOL!!!) At the beginning of November her sister who goes to the same school. Spoke to me about not liking school at Albany and she didn’t wanna go to date night later. I asked if her sister was going and she said no my GF(her sister) wasn't gonna be there.

Later on that I got a Snapchat from my GF in a dress and make up. I asked her why she was all dressed up and she said to me don’t worry. I asked her if she was going to date night and she said it was a first date themed party. The next day she says she appreciate everything I do for her but wanted to take things slow with me. Her excuse was she need to focus on school work. I asked if we were still exclusive but she said I shouldn’t worry. She gave some B.S excuse that she wants to get back with me and there is no time frame when we get back together.

I lost my mind because I felt like I did and sacrificed so much for her. The next steps I took were excessive but led me to find she was cheating on me. I DMed her ex boyfriend Garrick from school on instagram on a whim. I did this because I had my suspicions. He told she didn’t say ever she was dating me and they had sex a few times together during the semester. Aslo during the summer she went over his house every Thursday while she was suppose to be at work.( I didn't know because I worked in the city in the summer during the week) While she was at his house he asked her about me and said I was just her family friend that had a crush on her but she had no feeling for me. He said when he dated her she cheated on him a bunch. He was able to prove it with a screenshot recording of her texting him to come over on our anniversary to come over at 3am and have sex. He said he also saw her with other guys walking home some nights. He also said they she has multiple guys in every frat there that she fucks. Aslo that her other ex boyfriend Matt lived at the housing complex I saw her on her location that night not the other one she told me and he saw her car  parked there multiple times. I also can't believe Her little sister was in on the lies too but I found out she was also cheated on her boyfriend from back home too. Aslo when my girlfriend dated Garrick she cheated on him with the guy George she told me was gay. When I finally confronted her about it and showed her the texts she sent Garrick with the dates and times showing her number. She went crazy and denied everything saying now there was 0 chance of us getting  back together in the future  and how dare I reach out to Garrick.

When her mom called me I told her everything about her daughter cheating on me she didn’t believe it. She wanted us to meet over the winter break and talk things out and be friends for now because our families are very close. I’m just very hurt because I never loved anyone like her for so long. I still have some feelings for her because I loved her for many years. Also i'm not gonna lie she is very physically attractive and the sex was amazing(usually it is with the crazy ones lol) I dont think ill ever get and one better than her. But all my friends and close family say she is no good and I must cut her out of my life for good.

**tl;dr: Girlfriend cheated on me while at school and broke up with me I feel so hurt and confused about what happened. I don't know why but I am still obsessed with her and can't move on.**"
8,"I’m (18M) having relationship anxiety with my girlfriend (18F) of four months.


Hi, I’ve never posted here but basically I’ve been in a relationship with my girlfriend for only about 4 months, and everything up to this point has been fantastic. We’re both really into each other, and love spending time together. Over Christmas break I started feeling a creeping sensation of anxiety that I had felt in a previous relationship that I have had. For context, I have only been in one serious relationship prior, which lasted about a year. I ended it due to feeling anxiety about the relationship and not having the same feelings for her as I used to. I still feel like I have the same feelings for this girl, it’s just that the anxiety feels the same. Last week or so, it took a nosedive. 

I started feeling nauseous around her, I broke down in front of her, and then again later in front of my parents. After talking with my parents, I think I might be putting too much pressure on myself, between being in university and in this relationship. I told her on Friday that I needed to take a break, and that I’d talk with her again the next week. She cried, and I felt awful during and the awful feeling has basically lingered until today and onward I assume. I told her I needed time to sort out my thoughts and feelings, and that I felt I was putting too much pressure on myself. I don’t really know what to do this week, I don’t feel like things are becoming any clearer. 

Should I just end the break and reach out to her? I miss her. But at the same time, I’m worried I’m going to continue to feel anxious and nauseous. I’m also worried that by taking this break, I’ve jeopardized the relationship. Sorry if this is a little scattered, you can ask for any more details if you want.

TL;DR: Feeling relationship anxiety with 4 month relationship with GF, not sure if I should continue with the break that I suggested on taking or reach out and try to work it out with her."
9,"Should I (23F) tell my bf (24M) that I want to slow things down a bit?


My bf and I have been together for about a year and we are long distance. We recently were able to spend over a week together (verses the 2-3 days we usually squeeze out) and coming off of that time together he expressed that he felt the time solidified our relationship and that he can’t wait to get married. He’s been bubbling with joy about how all his previous doubts about me are gone and how he is finally truly happy with me and us. This is a bit disheartening to me because I told him about similar doubts previously and he never told me he worries about the same things. He would usually just brush it off as me overreacting or as it being a thing only I was experiencing. Anyhow, as we are now I still have doubts and based off our recent trip I actually feel like we would benefit from time apart or making our relationship more casual. 
Most of this stems from what I think are our communication issues. But there are other things too. For example, If I go against what he feels or what makes him happy it’ll become this big thing where he guilt trips me and makes me feel like a bother. All the while expressing that he’s basically putting up with my resistance because “he loves me” and he wouldn’t want to force me to do what I’m not okay with. But he doesn’t really take the time to see things from my perspective unless things blow up somehow. 

I love him and idk if these are just issues we will grow out off but in my previous relationships our arguments were more constructive than destructive so maybe it’s just that we haven’t gotten to the place where we can do that? Idk. 

I think time apart might be good for both of us but I don’t know if I’m overreacting or maybe there’s something else I should try first. Any input would be helpful. 

tl;dr - my bf wants to discuss the idea of getting married in the near future but I think we have to much to work on to move forward and think maybe we should take a step back from where we are. "
10,"I (22m) will be in her (22f) town soon, should I ask her to hang and most importantly when?


 So, went on a date not too long ago with this girl, really liked her and it went well BUT we mutually(more her than me, let's say 65/35) agreed that it would be a bad idea to try and make something out of it as she is on Erasmus(she was home for xmas) for a few months and we both don't know where will be this summer.

I will be in her town soon enough for job interviews for a few days, should I ask her to hang out and if yes should I ask before I get there (let's say 2 weeks in advance) or when I am already there?

Tl;Dr went out with her, went well but due to distance agreed not to try. Gonna be in her town soon, wanna ask her out, should I?"
11,"Is He Serious ? I'm So Confused &amp; Frustrated .


Hi, this will be messy but I'll try my best to explain..

So there's this guy that I'll say I am interested in. I'm too scared to say I like him because I don't want to get used to that idea since I honestly don't know if he's serious about me or not. So we're both 19 and during the last 3 years of high school we had one class together and he would flirt with me a lot, however I was in my first relationship which I was taking very seriously and he knew that I was not single and even though this relationship wasn't really working I was not going to cheat. Anyway fast forward to, say, around March 2018, I went to my best friend's house. \[P.S. he is my best friend's twin brother\] and we flirted and kinda kissed in his bedroom but nothing further than that. I was single and felt attracted to him, so I wanted to let him know to get to know him better and maybe start something. A few weeks or so later I planned to let him know. This was the first time I was about to tell anyone that I liked them and I was nervous so I discussed it with a friend who did not know him and she encouraged me. Eventually, I got a hold of his number and messaged him to go for coffee. He seemed up to it but after a while he kept saying he was busy. I felt embarrassed about the whole thing and we kept putting it off and eventually nothing happened. On my birthday, I found out that he went to another girl's house. Idk for what but I just knew he went. Obviously, I was hurt, but whatever. I kept visiting my best friend's house and he never brought it up and it never felt awkward that I'd actually asked him out. At this New Year's Eve party, we didn't really talk at the beginning of the night but later on we made out. Like a lot. He was smooth talking as usual and I kept half jokingly, half seriously telling him how much of a liar he was. He was saying things like ""You're really hot"", ""You're the first girl I've ever kissed in my room, ""I've never been chasing a girl for 3 years"", ""I have a lot of respect for you"", things like that. Neither of us were drunk that night. Anyway, I found out that he had a hickey on his neck, which certainly was not from me. His mom drove me home and when I greeted everyone he turned to look at me and smiled very sweetly. I really like kissing him. This sounds very cheesy and stupid, I know, but I've never felt the way I do when I kiss him with anyone else ever. It feels right in a way but it's just that I don't know if he's serious about anything. I wouldn't mind getting to know him better but I don't want to be another piece in his game if this is all this is. I really want to know what's happening but I don't want to ask since I'm still embarrassed by the whole coffee date thing not happening. I also don't want to come across as desperate. And I do all this research to see if he's really interested but it still leaves me confused. He says one thing but he's literally never texted me except that one time to wish me a happy birthday. I mean he doesn't mind kissing me in front of his friends like at the party, he's told his mom he thinks I'm really pretty.. I just, really don't know what to do or what to think. Am I wasting my time? I know I'm young but I always want stability in all my relationships so I'm serious but I don't know if he is. He says these things and acts like this but how do I know he doesn't do this with other girls?

I hate being so confused and I want to get over all this if it's just bs. I just need real advice rn please.

TLDR: Mixed signals?"
12,"I [M24] ended the relationship because I wasn't financially stable?


We dated for a very short time about 3 months and genuinely liked her. Rather than keep things accelerating between us I ended it because I didn't have the money to sustain a healthy relationship.

Going on dates costed me $$$ when I could have been paying off debt. Gifts for her and thinking about traveling plans together was another ""down the road"" idea. 

I really did like her she was a good one. Although I'm glad in some sense from a financial point of view. It does suck and I was and still am embarrassed about my situation. Anyone else had a similar situation?

TL;DR
I ended the relationship rather quickly to not mislead her because I wasn't financially stable. "
13,"I [F 20] am thinking of breaking up with my boyfriend [23 M] because he is still friends with his old crush [F 20]


 

This is my first post on reddit. It's pretty long, but I'm desperate for some advice right now. I am sorry I make any grammar mistakes, but English isn't my native language.

Around a year ago, in September 2017, I met this guy. We became friends and bonded really quickly. From the beginning of our friendship, he used to talk to me about this girl that he had a crush on but things went very wrong. Her personality didn't seem the best from the description- she's the kind of narcissistic person who keeps many people around for attention and validation, without building meaningful relationships. From the way he described it, it seemed like everyone in their friend's group had a crush on her. Despite that, she paid the most attention to him and that probably made him feel special. They had become so close that it was almost like they were together at some point, but they never were since she had a bf. This lasted for some months, but after one point she was treating him horribly and she even blocked him.

Back to me, I disliked this girl from the start because of the things I had heard about her. I had no romantic interest in him at that point, but I really empathized with him. Anyway, one day I found her Instagram account, and oh my, she was gorgeous. She pulled of a look that I was always afraid to try. I got really jealous, but not because of the things that happened between them, I didn't care about that at that point, but because she did things I never had the courage to try. Meanwhile, apart from talking about the things that happened between them, he also he used to talk about her interests and she seemed to be pretty interesting as well, apart from being so pretty. This made me feel even more self conscious.

Anyway, I'll fast forward to April 2018. Here I'd like to mention that for the past two years I've been struggling with clinical depression and anxiety disorders, so I've been having a pretty rough time. I decided to try something different, and try tinder dating. I went a couple of times with a guy, and it went pretty bad. The person I was mostly venting to about this was my current bf. This brought us even closer and it made me realise that we really match and that I'd really love to be in a relationship with him. I broke up with the other guy, told him how I feel and we immediately got together. When this happened, I had no idea that he still talked with his old crush. I thought that he was still blocked by her. If I knew, maybe I'd consider more getting into a relationship, because I knew from the start that I'm bad at coping with this kind of situations, especially when it comes with people I feel inferior to, such as her.

Here I'd like to mention that this is a long distance relationship, but we are able to meet sort of often, so it's not a big problem.

Right after me and him got in a relationship, this girl started getting involved. She added me on snap and started talking to me. I'm not sure if she was just being friendly or if there were other motives, but the whole thing really made me uncomfortable. I tried not to talk about this with him in the start, since I am aware that I have no right to tell him what to do, but I couldn't help but being passive aggressive about it a couple of times. Late July, around two months of being together, I started being really fed up with this. My bf is kind of addicted to video games , and on the one hand I was really anxious regarding being ignored cuz of this because I felt that I was uninteresting to him, on the other hand it seemed like they spent so much more time together when there was situation going on with her. I tried to hold myself but I couldn't control it sometimes and I said some pretty bad things. It also felt and still feels like he spends much more time with her, because they sometimes play together and they are also Best Friends of snapchat. By the way I play games too, but he barely plays with me nowdays.

In August, he stayed in my house for about a week and met my parents. We had a really nice time, apart from the fact that he talked about her a lot, and he even mentioned her after some .. intimate moments :/ Meanwhile, all this time I was very anxious about improving myself for him to like me more than her and kinda get bored of her and let go but it never happened. I couldn't and still can't forget about how he used to speak about her when he was in love with her. I doubt that he ever spoke this way about me.

In November, there was a night when he was playing games with her and he was ignoring my messages. This made me go crazy. Out of the blue, I blocked her on snapchat and everywhere else and made a huge scene to him the next day. I've made scenes other times too, but this was the worst time. I felt crap about it later but I couldn't control it, I was in literal panic.

One week after that, I visited him in his house for a week. He had gotten really sick, so I took him to the hospital, went to buy medicine for him, made him tea and even had a sleepless night on the bathroom floor for him. I can't say that we had a blast, but this whole experience brought us even closer and he saw how much I care about him.

The past month, nothing has changed regarding the situation with the other girl and I honestly don't know if I can cope with it anymore. I don't think it's his fault, and he has every right to speak with her. I've tried, for all the months that we were together, to be neutral about them being close, but I honestly can't. It kills me inside. The past week I've been crying literally every day about it. I just can't stop thinking how better of a much they are. He isn't the kind of person who talks a lot, but with her he seems to change. It's like she brings out his best self. I really wish I could do the same for him. I feel horrible with myself for making scenes all the time. I feel like I'm toxic and abusive to him and I hate it. I've also gotten many literal panic attacks when I saw that they were playing games together. I had difficulty to breathe and I was about to pass out

I think the only solution is for us to break up. He doesn't want this to happen and I don't either, but I hate make him sad and I hate being sad every day because of this situation. We truly love each other, but honestly this whole thing is really toxic in my opinion. I've tried breaking up many times but I always came back crying. By the way, I was the one who tried to break up every single time. I can't imagine my life without him but all I want him is to be happy. I've really failed in making him happy. I think that I should be alone for a little bit, and get into another relationship when I'm more mature about it.

What do you think?

Thanks a lot if you reached this point of the text. I'm sorry it was this long, I just wanted to give you the full image of the situation.

EDIT : I forgot to say that I've been cheated on by another guy in the past but I don't know if this plays any role in this.

 

### tl;dr: I am thinking of breaking up with my boyfriend, because he is still friends with his old crush, with who he was really obsessed with. I know I can't tell him what to do, but this situation kills me inside."
14,"I(16M) need to visit my girlfriend's(16F)Parents


[removed]"
15,"I [33M] am starting to think my wife [27F] might be an emotionally abusive person


My wife and I have been together for almost 10 years, and married for about 2. We have a young son together, and I love them both very much.


I have always had problems with anxiety (mostly social, ""shyness"") whereas she is the exact opposite. Very strong-willed and tough. It's part of why I love her. 


However, she can get extremely short-tempered and emotional very quickly over sometimes seemingly random and small things. When I try to comfort her, it often seems to make things worse. When I let her have her space, that makes it even worse. There have been times when I've told her (sometimes later, sometimes during) that I don't know what to do to make her feel better since everything I try is wrong, but then she gets upset because ""I should know by now"". She's even admitted that even \*she\* doesn't know what she needs.

&amp;#x200B;

Anyway, I came across a post here a few months ago that listed signs of an abusive relationship, and I was shocked that I could relate to some of them. I always thought our personalities might be slightly off, or that she could be a little bi-polar or something, but I'd never considered that some of the things she does might actually be abuse.


After a recent fight, I decided to look into it more, and once again I found a lot of similarities between her behaviors and those of an emotionally abusive person. Here are some of them:


**Walking on eggshells.** This might be the main one. I've even used this exact phrase when we 'fight'. It often seems like there is no right answer, and absolutely nothing I can do will help, but I still get the sense that she blames me for not knowing how to help (even though she doesn't know either). When we have disagreements, I have never felt free to completely speak my mind because I know my true feelings will probably upset her. For a quick example, a few years ago she wanted a golden retriever. I didn't, because we already had a dog and several cats, and we couldn't afford having another one, especially a 'real' breed like that. We also had a baby, and throwing a new dog into the mix would just add too much stress to our lives. I had to be extremely careful in voicing my concerns, because she does *not* like to be told ""no"" when she wants something. Long story short, we now have a golden retriever.


**Jealousy.** One of my favorite albums is Pet Sounds. I once told her that listening to it reminded me of being in college. She immediately interpreted that as 'reminding me of my *girlfriend* in college' and got super upset. I was completely blindsided by it, because I *never* bring up exes. She eventually apologized, but I don't listen to that album much anymore, especially not around her. That is one example of many, where seemingly random things will incite intense jealousy. 


**Won't acknowledge strengths, ignores things I'm passionate about, and criticizes instead.** I used to be a very musical person. I play a lot of instruments and even wrote and recorded songs. The first few years of our relationship she seemed to like that, but now she doesn't acknowledge it at all. It used to be one of my biggest passions, and she could care less. I brought it up once and she started crying and apologizing and saying she loves when I play music and that she would try to notice more, but that was quickly forgotten and things went back to normal. I'm also super into science, but when I try to have conversations about it, she couldn't seem less interested. (Whereas I always go out of my way to ask her about her job and things she cares about. I'm genuinely interested.) I also find myself bringing up things I've done around the house, because I weirdly crave her acknowledgment of things I've done as she never seems to appreciate the things I do otherwise. She can also be extremely critical and will point out everything I'm doing that's wrong or weird, which of course plays right into my social anxieties. I dread driving with her, because I'm not the most confident driver (though I think I'm pretty good and safe), because it is literally impossible for us to go somewhere without her getting annoyed at something I'm doing on the road. It makes me even more self-conscious, which of course just leads to even more 'mistakes'.


**Withholding affection/sex.** I find her extremely attractive, and she knows this, but we go through long periods where she seems to have no interest in sex. If I try to initiate, she brushes me off (sometimes in a way that suggests my advances are annoying her), but then weeks later she will get upset that I'm never initiating sex. It's another situation where it feels like there is no right answer.


There are a lot of other things I could write about, like how she often swears at me and calls me names during fights (which I never do to her), hates all forms of privacy (this also ties into the jealousy thing), has an intense need to get her way in almost every situation and makes me feel guilty for not 'supporting her' when I disagree, thinks my family is out to get her even though they are just like me (quite reserved and quiet), doesn't seem to want to talk things out when we fight (most of them end with her slamming a door and walking away), I sometimes feel the need to apologize or explain away her behavior to people, etc. Also, she had a slightly troubled childhood with her parents divorcing and her dad going to prison for a few years, and we're both almost certain he's a narcissist. (I read that some of that stuff can cause you to become abusive later in life.)


**HOWEVER,** there are some things that make me think she *isn't* actually an emotionally abusive person. For starters, none of the things I've mentioned seem calculating or intentionally manipulative. They're just... how she is. She doesn't really lie or gaslight. (She will sometimes stretch the truth a bit to make her point or get a certain outcome, but she won't outright lie.) She doesn't put me down with 'jokes' at my expense. She doesn't attempt to control me with surprises or changing up plans or anything like that. She doesn't lack empathy as far as I can tell... she cries at movies and I believe has a good heart.


Sorry this is so long. I'm just torn and don't know what to think or how to deal with it.


TL;DR: My wife does a lot of the same things emotionally abusive people apparently do, which makes our relationship difficult at times, but she also doesn't do a lot of them. I need help figuring out what she is and how to deal with it."
16,"I'm finding myself feeling depressed and have a lot of fears that make me think very bad about my SO, even though he hasn't shown any signs. I am having panicky attacks and outbursts on the smallest rejections and I don't know what to do.


Hi reddit, I'm on my phone and not native English so sorry. This is going to be long I'm sorry but to understand where I'm coming from this might be handy.


I'm 22F and my life was good before I met my SO. It was simple, a routine and I had friends and family surrounded. I had a study I loved and my motorbike to ride every day etc. I finally had a grip on my depression that has been there from 11 till 18. 2 great years of little ups and downs and me being finally me again! I can't describe that feeling but it made me so happy.


Jan. 2018

I was getting bored though since I'm an outgoing and adventurous person and I never went to new Zealand. So why not? For my final internship I flew over to new Zealand. It started of quite rocky since I was traveling with family that couldn't stand me breathing. They would scream at me for asking something and that I just need to shut up. So that brought me in a very bad situation for 3 weeks of feeling trapped and was it all a mistake?


When I got to my place to stay they were so friendly and I felt home immediately. The bad family went away after a week and I could start my life in NZ. I met this great guy L and we hit it off like fireworks. I've never felt so in love before. He was just like me! Adventurous, goals and very funny. The thing was that back home I still had an on, off kind of boyfriend. I told him I met L and that I wasn't so sure about our relationship anymore. It wasn't just because of the crush but also that he was 30, bad job, no goals, friend hobbies and all of that, none! So I already knew something was wrong. We did a break but I also hung around with L and even kissed him. Then I was sure that I wanted to be with L, vut also felt horrible because I cheated on my ex and started dating L.
It was a huge thing for me. I am still not proud of it and so ashamed that I thought I could trust myself but clearly not and who am I as a person then? A cheater apparently. It was bad. I started dating L.


June 2018

Best time of my life there. I had an internship that was super amazing, mountains and good weather everywhere and a super handsome fun guy to hang around with after work and go on dates with. It was so exciting! Then the date that I went for a south island trip came around and a good friend of mine (knows for 7 years) wanted to go with me and I thought nice! Half the costs and fun and not doing this alone. Good one!
Bad one. My friend M saw it as an opportunity to drink and party everywhere. And drunk M did stuff like grabbing me in my sleep, sleep naked and go missing for a day. I freaked out and had long talks with him how he crossed my boundaries and how it made me feel (I've been harassed in the past when I was 14. Everyone knows since it was a case of without my consent) that was also my first time. 

I told L this but I was ashamed for apparently not knowing my friend enough and he didn't knew how to be there for me.. big fight and me getting a plane back to wellington was the result. I was broken and lost and luckily L was there for me the whole time. 


I went back to my country for my degree and L came to be there for me. It was great! But also the first time living together in a (for him) foreign country and in my home. We've had our fair share of big fights but also best moments ever while traveling and doing things together. It was ups and downs a bit. New situation with a person to share and yeah it was difficult. After all that happened I am not good with trust since I was 14 and learned the hard way..


3 months of traveling and doing things together was great but also challenging. I shouldn't forget that everything in my life always has a downside of it being challenging in it. Getting my degree? Wow! But my mom can't be there with me and I don't know what to do now.. *insert fear that kind of takes over during the day.


October 2018

He went back to NZ to end his job and I started a new one that wasn't something for me. It made me doubt about myself alot. Can I do this and that and what now? No more routine, a love 18000km away and no study. I had my friends, family and L in this but it didn't stop the thoughts and panicky attacks.


L got a job offer in Melbourne and wanted to move there with me. After working for a bit at home and making alot of pro and con lists and talking to my therapist everyone agreed I should take the chance and so I did. I thought I was strong enough and wanted a challenge and I'll always have my friends and family,  only they are 10 hours away. 


I'm in Melbourne now for a month or 2 and things have been better. Me and L have had a bad fight about me not feeling well and getting overwhelmed in fears and insecurities and projecting it on him , since pushing away is protecting myself? I don't know. He didn't know anymore either. It was scary. We got over it and I've been happy in melbourne for a month while being with his fam and looking for a job, house and car. It's been stressful and I don't like sitting still. Still it felt a bit more like home than all the traveling around. 


Now

Since a few days I've been having panick attacks. Crying alot about little things and being afraid he will leave me and will find someone better than me. I'm not happy with myself right now. I try to get up and do things but the thoughts and fears keep coming back. I've been checking his phone too and ofc couldn't find anything weird on it. But the fact that that shows no trust and I feel bad for doing it. It feels like I just smoke one more cigarette and yes I quit after this one. It's tempting but it doesn't give me anything. He doesn't care that I look but I wish he got mad sometimes.



I don't know what's wrong with me. I have this great boyfriend that tells me every day how much he loves me and makes sure I'm okay but getting drinks and dinner. I have a place to temp stay and we are puppy sitting. Looking for jobs and even had an interview etc. Still I feel worthless and a bad girlfriend for being so. I want to look into therapy again because well I'm getting sick and tired of the bad thoughts that are also so easy to hear and listen to.



TL;DR I'm showing bad behaviour to my so of 10 months that I love very much but my fears and bad thought are taking over since I'm in a new situation with him of emigrating to a new country and I surrender to the bad thoughts and fears because I'm exhausted and stressed and some times have the feeling of ""I just want it to stop"" Me and my bf do talk about it but every time I tell him what I think and feel I'm even more scared to lose him because who wants to be with someone that feels and thinks like this?
It's a cycle."
17,"My [24M] boyfriend [23M] has no social life and it's driving me nuts


My bf and I have been together for about 9 months now. I really care about him and the relationship is to the point where we are discussing moving in together once our leases expire. He is super respectful and kind and I often think to myself how lucky I am to be with someone as caring and genuine as him.

The only problem is that I am someone who values time apart, and he is not. Every time I go out with my friends, he wants to come along. My friends have tried to invite him out without me (because they know about this problem), and he won't go unless I go. I have tried to encourage him to make friends at work, but he says his work has too much of a ""douche culture"" and has no interest. I went away on vacation for 2 weeks and he literally sat at home and did nothing while I was gone. We texted back and forth while I was away but he was messaging me so frequently that I didn't really feel we had time apart at all.

I really don't know what to do. I tell him I like space, and he respects that, but I start to feel an immense amount of guilt because his roommates are the last people on earth who don't know he's gay so while I'm having fun by myself or with my friends, I keep thinking about how he's just alone at home waiting for me to come back and it makes me feel smothered. It also results in him sleeping at my place 5-6 nights a week, which I simultaneously love but get annoyed by because I don't have space to myself.

How can I make more of an effort to get him to make more friends and have a life of his own? Please help!

TL;DR: My boyfriend doesn't have his own social life which causes him to depend on me. I feel smothered and none of my suggestions help the situation. What else can I do?"
18,"My Uncle and Aunt (M/F 50s) are depressed, MAY be suicidal, shown suicidal symptoms in the past. My sister (18F) wants to help but doesn't know how.


I posted the original story on the therapy subreddit then noticed this sub has more traffic. Basically I have an Uncle and Aunt who just lost their son to suicide and they are depressed and possibly suicidal themselves with severe marital issues (barely talk to each other). I don't know them well, and the details are 3rd hand thru my Mom and Sister who are Evangelical Christian wingnuts. My Mom flatout doesn't believe in the mental health industry and thinks it's demonic. My sister is more on the fence, she reached out to me out of desperation and not fully trusting prayer to help them anymore but doesn't know much about psychiatry except it's anti religion. She is close to their daughter and really wants to help. I live thousands of miles from everybody and can't do anything except possibly help find/pay for treatment and forward/filter your advice to my sister.

&amp;#x200B;

Examples of problems: One time Mom visited them and found a hose attached to vehicle, this was several years ago shortly after their son had a suicide attempt and dropped out of college (school success was everything to them) and it couldn't have been the son because he wasn't living there at the time.

&amp;#x200B;

Another example: Uncle and Aunt fight so viciously and often that my cousin confides in my sister regularly over Facebook about how scared she is to live there.  (She's living at a local college now so no longer in physical danger, but from what I gather the parents sound hyper controlling and invest all of their self worth into their kids type)

&amp;#x200B;

They are also obsessed with saving every penny for their children and as a result don't take proper care of themselves or have hobbies or lives or friends of their own. My Sister has some anecdotes about them ignoring (physical) medical advice for themselves. Some issues with pride and distrust of Western medical industry is what it sounded like.

&amp;#x200B;

My main question is this. At what point does it become legally possible to get my Uncle and Aunt involuntarily committed or at least required to get help? As in when does the evidence for 'threat to self or others' threshold get crossed legally speaking? I'm basically looking for a, 'Do say ABC. Don't say DEF. And if they exhibit XYZ then do Q.' type of checklist.

&amp;#x200B;

Also, I know this is a long shot but is there any possible way to slip antidepressants into care package food or is that 100% a bad or illegal idea no matter what? I Can see my sister being up for that if I convince her its a medical life/death necessity. Thanks for all your help and time.

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR: My Uncle and Aunt are depressed and possibly suicidal. How/When do I Get people help who don't understand what it is &amp; why they need it?"
19,"Am I (30sF) wrong to not want to try a LDR with my potential boyfriend (30sM)?


I have no interest in a LDR but the relationship already has all necessary components to succeed. We both love each other and want to be together but I think it will destroy what we have. What we have is amazing and worth hanging on to, hence I don't want to see it burn down.

Should we put it on hold and come back to something great in the future, if things align in both our lives then, or go forward and risk destroying it?

Tl;dr: risk destroying a great relationship through long distance, or leave it alone for now and come back to it?"
20,"How do I (17M), maintain this 3 day relationship with a (16F)


I'd like to thank anyone who takes their time to give me advice on this beforehand. 

I, about a month ago befriended a girl who hung around my social group for a while. I'm a shy person, and she picked up on it as she too is shy. We got talking about how our shyness affects us and found very loads of common interest and traits. 

For the sake of this, we will call her Summer. 

Summer has mental health problems, including depression and anxiety. I've been helping her though many personal problems, as she's moved from an abusive and mentally bad environment.

On a nightly basis I would be up to the early hours comforting her. She said she sometimes comfortable being uncomfortable and sad. 

Anyways, she hates Christmas. So whilst I was with my close family, etc, I was also texting her all day. To keep her happy. 

Around two weeks later, she asked me if I was interested in anyone. And we are such good friends at this time. I asked her and she said she likes someone, but knows he won't back. I was curious as to who and why she hadn't told me. After a deep conversation, I admitted to her I had romantic interest In for a while. And still do. 

She said yes, and I was her crush too. 

My problem is, firstly this is both our first ever relationships. She had a long distance, but called it and now has a problem with the label of boyfriend girlfriend. 

It's been a few days now and for about the past month we have pretty much spoken for hours on a daily basis. The other summer mentioned she wanted to place a date on the date. Like when we are doing it. 

I'm going away to New York for one week this Tuesday, so our date has to wait past then. She mentions how she's really going to miss me etc. Out of conversation I mentioned what we could do on the date. 

She's mentioned she is nervous about the romantic side of this, because we are such good friends. 

But she also keeps asking me questions like 'do you like hugs? Cuddles?'

Now thanks for staying with me, here I get to the point. 

I asked her if this is her first relationship. She replied with 'what? No, I thought we are just friends? At least this moment. Sorry for freaking out, btw'. 

She then said she wants to go to bed and hasn't messaged me since. 

I really like her and I don't want to ruin this. Is it normal for us not to message all the time? Like, we have been before?

I have one more day tomorrow to spend with her at university before I leave for a week. Can anyone suggest anything? Am I overreacting?

I am going to have a private conversation in person tomorrow with her. I want to hug her and talk to her. Is this a good idea?

I extremely appreciate anyone who reads and helps me. This is an absolute mess and I really appreciate any advice. 

I will adjust spelling as I notice it, sorry for problems. 

TL;DR any advice on how to talk to someone after they accept a date, otherwise I can't summarise

Thanks in advance 
"
21,"My best friend [18/M] has turned into a completely different person ever since he started dating his girlfriend. What should I [18/M] do?


Me and my best friend since the 1st grade are currently in our senior year of high school and back in November, he started dating his girlfriend. And guess what? After only a few weeks of dating, they moved into an apartment together. No kidding, right after Thanksgiving, they moved in together and I personally thought they were rushing into things and I told him about this, but he didn't want to hear it.

The worst part is that he's become a completely different person. Me and him use to do everything together, even if we were a bit immature about it. In elementary school, we would ding-dong ditch together and stay up all night playing video games and watching movies. In our past few years of high school, we'd always hang out together and I would do everything in my power to get us to spend as much time together since we didn't have a ton of classes together and I'd constantly worry about us growing apart. But we've still maintained our friendship, that is until his stupid girlfriend got in the mix. She'd constantly criticize us for being ""immature"" and she'd tell us off for our past behaviors like ding-dong ditching and video games and he's actually agreed with her that we need to mature, but the first major incident came just before Christmas.

My friend and his girlfriend were going out to a Christmas tree farm to pick out a tree for their apartment and they invited me along. I went with them and when we got there, they both acted like I wasn't even there. They'd talk about what trees they wanted and didn't even ask for my input. But when they found a tree, he just told me to pick it up and carry it to their car for them. I then knew that that was the only reason they invited me. They both just held hands and talked with each other while I lugged along a giant Christmas tree. I would cuss out loud and ask for help every now and then, but they basically just ignored me. When we got to the car, I just threw the tree down and lost it. I picked up a rock and threw it as hard as I could at my friend's car. It completely smashed in his windshield and we both started yelling each other in front of everyone in the parking lot. I ended up getting an Uber ride home and I tried to apologize later that night, but he ignored my call and a few days later, I woke up on Christmas morning to find a penis spray-painted on my windshield with the words ""Merry Christmas, fucker"" right under it. Again, we didn't talk and the next major incident came yesterday.

I went to their apartment yesterday and I confronted my friend about how he's changed all because of his girlfriend. She was there and she kept saying to him ""You see? He's immature! That's what I've been telling you!"" I called her out for trying to drive a wedge between us, but neither of them wanted to hear what I had to say. My friend even said that I'm not invited to his end of the year graduation party, something that he's been talking about for a while and that set me off. I told him that he was whipped and I called his girlfriend a ""stupid bitch"" to her face. My friend simply said that he's ""growing up"" and moving on from ""immature people"" and that's when I left.

How do I fix this? Like I said, we've been best friends since the first grade and I don't want this to end because of a girl that he has a less than 1% chance of still dating in the near future. I don't want our years of friendship to be thrown away. I admit that I'm at fault in some areas, but his girlfriend hasn't liked me from the moment we met. Her whole goal is to push us away from each other and I don't know how to convince my friend of this. What can I do?

&amp;#x200B;

tldr: Best friend is different after finding a girlfriend, I don't want our friendship to end."
22,"Long time FWB(27F) confessed to me(28M), I said no. Now all my friends are pissed at me.


1st time posting, long time lurker. So I'm Chuck, 28M, DJ/MC from LA. My friends call me Chucky, ChuckDizzle, or just Chuck-EEEEeee... depending on the situation.

This situation is about me and my FWB Kelly. We have been chillin since college. Nothing too serious though. When either one of needs some company, the other one is there. That's pretty much how it's been since the beginning. Kelly is the sister of my friend Hyun. We have pretty much the same circle of friends, and we are all really close. Our ""relationship"" was never really a secret to the group, but we never officially announced what we are.

Our other friend Vi was getting married this weekend, so we all went to vegas to celebrate. Turns out that Kelly pregamed too hard, and by the time we got too the club, she was already sloppy drunk. Somehow just because we sleep together sometimes it became my responsibility to take care of her. That meant I couldn't really party, and I couldn't hook up. Was pretty pissed.

After the club we went to get tacos. Kelly suddenly screams that she had an announcement. In front of everyone Kelly says that she texted her boyfriend and broke up with him. Then she said that her and I had been sleeping together(except more explicitly) since college. She said that she was in love with me. She had been in love with me for years. She tried to fight it, I am a douchbag and an asshole, a mysogonist, broke, lazy, no future, etc, etc. And her parents hate me. But no matter how many times she has tried to find someone better than me, I am the only one in her heart. Then she tried to kiss me.

I stopped her from kissing me. everyone was stunned. They didnt know whether to laugh or not. I could tell. Hyun is just like, WTF bro? I'm just like, 1st of all, she is drunk, And we hook up sometimes, but that's it. So I'm really pissed at this point. I am talking louder than I mean to, and I tell Kelly that she is drunk. She probably doesnt know what she is saying. Even if she did, she knows I dont want that kind of relationship. I am trying to focus on my music. Plus I am not trying to settle down. Even if I were gon a settle down, Kelly wouldn't be the one I chose. She cheated on every single boyfriend she ever had(with me). And if she would cheat on them, she would prolly cheat on me too. Plus why would I wanna be with someone who thinks so lowly of me. I need somebody who supports my dreams. So no, we wont be a couple. And that whole FWB thing is done too.

She started crying. They all took her side. I took an uber back to the room. This morning I got a text talking about I should apologize. 

Should I Apologize? Should I give her a chance? Am I the asshole?

TL;DR Long time FWB confessed to me drunkenly,  I turned her down now everyone's mad at me."
23,"I (F26) finally slept with Mr.Right-But-Wrong-Timing (M29) and discovered this.


 Four years ago, I met this guy when I went to a party. He was the first one to approach me, telling me I was the “cutest girl” there that night. It felt very genuine and in no way creepy. He invited me to watch a boxing match with him and his childhood friend. Unfortunately, I had a boyfriend at the time so I declined. I couldn’t bring myself to tell him, but I gave him my social media to link with him.  


The following year we miraculously bumped into each other at an art event in the city. At the time I had gotten out of the previous relationship. We spoke to each other all night, never leaving each other’s side. We were even photographed together with his friends. After that night, we tried to keep in touch. We hung out together three times after that. The same thing happened where we spent the whole night talking and never leaving each other’s side. Eventually we finally agreed to have lunch together. At this point I wasn’t sure if he was interested in me or he just wanted to be friends. He paid for lunch and afterwards, I went back home. I didn’t hear from him after that and I didn’t bother to text him because I didn’t want to be too clingy or forward.  


Months passed and I’m not the type to wait, so I ended up dating another person and ending up in another relationship. Throughout the course of my new relationship, I never heard from him. However, he was still orbiting my Instagram by liking my photos and watching my stories.  


In 2017, I decided to move to another city to pursue a new career. I hosted a Going-Away party and he came with a group of his friends. He sat down with me and we were catching up. I still felt the chemistry, but tried to push it aside because I was in a relationship. 

So fast forward, I finally move. Within a month of living in a new city, the guy visits and we link up. He picks me up, takes me out for dinner and pays. We go to a bar and catch up. I’m having a lovely time and the connection is still there. However, in my mind I believed he only saw me as a friend... that was until we went to his AirBnB to watch a Netflix show I recommended to him. Next thing I know he asks if he could kiss me and I tell him no because I’m in a long distance relationship. I said I didn’t think he saw me like that and he said he always liked me and that we dated (because we went on that one day). He apologized and said that he liked me more for being honest and loyal to my boyfriend at the time. I leave his apartment still feeling the tension.  


Time jump, I’m no longer in a relationship and it’s December 2018. I’m visiting home to see family. I was also excited because it would be the first time that I would be single and we would be hanging out. So we finally meet up at a bar, and once again, we have an Amazing. We catch up on mostly everything and I feel the chemistry between us. It felt so easy to be with him. He kept saying things like how he was thinking of moving to my city, how he would like to travel with me, how I should roll dumplings with his family and other things. He also told me he went traveling recently, to which I asked if he went with his girlfriend. He clarified that she was his ex and that they were still pals. He then asked me if I was with my partner, to which I replied no. I opened up about how my ex wanted to propose and how I didn’t feel right marrying him. The guy says he was in an on-and-off relationship too where he considered marriage. After a few hours of talking, we ended up at his apartment and one thing led to another and we had sex.  


He kept saying how he couldn’t believe that I was there with him and that I was sleeping next him. He let me wear his clothes and cuddled with me. He said at one point, “You know some guys just sleep with girls, and I know I’ve been guilty of it too, but I wanted to let you know that I really like you as a person.”  


Now we were supposed to hang out the next day, but something came up so we hung out the night before I flew back into my city. He brought a group of friends and we didn’t really get to hang out much. At the end of the night he told me he had to get a good night’s sleep because he had to wake up early the next morning. Before he left, he repeated to me again that he’s really considering moving to my city and that we should go on a trip when he visits next. I nod somehow feeling something was off.  


Fast forward to the present, I haven’t heard from him. He didn’t even bother to wish me a happy new year. So I check his IG story and noticed his went to some place in the mountains. My gut was telling me that he went with his ex-girlfriend. And after looking at her page, she had a video of him and her. Then I did a little digging and realized that they had been dating on and off since 2016, which was the year he disappeared. I also found out her birthday... which was the day after the night we hooked up. My intuition tells me he saw her the day after and that’s why he was distant at my second going-away party.  


I feel devastated. For four years, I had fantasized about him. I honestly believed he was Mr.Right-At-The-Wrong-Time. I want to believe he actually likes me, but when I think about the times we saw each other, it was because it wasn’t working out with his ex. I am absolutely disappointed and jaded at this point. I don't understand. There's a photo of he and I hanging on his fridge!  


TDLR; The guy who I thought was Mr.Right-At-Wrong-Time for 4 years was just stringing me along. "
24,"I(16F) realized or think I am a Lesbian but am in a hetero relationship.


This sucks but I will try to explain why I think so.  
So for the past 5 years I haven't really known any girls and I've spent all my time online. I was really attention seeking and took anyone I could. I never went out or tried to meet any girls so I just ended up with guys. I don't know how in love I was with any. They all seem more of a dependency than love.   


In elementary school I said, ""I don't have anything against gay people but I just don't want to be one."" Which makes me think that I've just been in denial for a really long time and just wanted some kind of human interaction. ( I should mention all relationships I've been in have been ldr ) Later in my life when I did go out in public places all I would ever notice is girls and I would talk to my father about how cute a girl was at a restaurant. Looking back on elementary school I definitely had a crush on my best friend. ( Who is a female ) As well as later in life I had a crush on a girl for over a year around middle school.  I started to think about how I wanted to marry a girl around that age. 

&amp;#x200B;

I don't really think I feel attraction to men. I never really cared? The person I'm currently with I would keep telling myself to just ignore how they looked but it still bothers me.  For girls I have a type and am a little more picky? I find myself fantasizing about having a girlfriend all the time and getting married. 

&amp;#x200B;

I haven't been with this guy for long ( 3 months) and I always hated how he looked but I tried not to care. He was like a best friend because we had something to relate to. He wanted to come in January but I kept passively saying like "" You don't have to "" Because I know I didn't want him to come.  Whenever he sends me a picture I just cringe and try to just ignore it but I feel like a bitch.  I avoid sexual things with him but I end up feeling guilty for it. 

&amp;#x200B;

I started having these feelings after I reconnected with females. I suddenly became more irritated towards him and couldn't figure out why. I didn't know what to do. I never lashed out but I tried spending less time with him. The more time I spend with girls the more I think to myself I might be a lesbian because I find myself swooning over them. 

&amp;#x200B;

In real life I don't think I've ever had a crush on a guy but I can't remember. I think all my crushes have been female irl. There are sexual things too where I like girls as well I just don't want to really talk about that here. 

&amp;#x200B;

Now this is problematic because it might just seem like I'm bi but the more I think about it the more it makes sense where I just think I'm a lesbian. I don't know what to say or what to say to him and I know all the answers here won't be definite. I'm scared of just being alone now. I feel like that's why I haven't said anything to him.  I've been thinking about this for awhile and I reached out to someone who said I think you know your answer, lesbian. 

&amp;#x200B;

I feel scared and terrified of being alone and I feel so guilty I don't really know what to do and the person I reached out to said I need to tell them soon. Maybe not today but just to sleep on it.

&amp;#x200B;

 TL;DR : I'm in a hetero relationship but believe I am a lesbian. "
25,"My Girl (17) had to break up with me (17) because of parental pressure and I need a way to have her back


Me and my girl have been together for 8 months, we both go to the same high school.
She was always under serious pressure by her mother and the school management until she had enough and said that we have to break up about 3 weeks ago.
I've given her sometime to cool off and I want her back as I genuinely cannot live without her.
Any help on how I can make her feel safe and get back to me?
I believe that the breakup wasn't her choice. 
Also I'm close friends with her sister but her two other friends always wanted us to break up as one of them likes me and the other sides with her

TLDR: I want help getting my girl back"
26,"I (M25) have lied repeatedly to my gf (F25) throughout the relationship, are things salvageable?


Long time lurker, first time poster. I began a relationship with my gf just under a year ago. She asked a lot of questions regarding my past relationships which was a new experience for me. I have been in two previous relationships to her, each lasting around 3 years, and never before had I been questioned so much regarding my past relationships. Things she wanted to know: timelines, reasons for breaking up, reasons why I liked them, and so on. When I broke up with my last ex, I, for a short amount of time, dated for a couple months before meeting my current gf. My gf wanted to know the details regarding those people as well. Who I had dated, how long, who ended things and chose not to continue dating, and so on.

Compared to her, my memory is absolutely terrible. I remember back in highschool struggling to memorize things for tests. This has proven to damage my current relationship because I may forget to tell her things or simply forget that I have told other people things and with her perfect memory (it really is), she can remember exactly what I said months ago, verbatim. Recently, things about my exes have been brought up and I’ll provide more information than I originally provided. She considers this outright lying and I agree and have apologized. Other lies (not intentional, just me being forgetful), have included me telling her, “I wouldn’t tell my friend X” (X being something about my gf), then later (sometimes weeks later) mentioning, “Oh, yea, I told my friend X”. In my mind, I’m not intentionally lying, I have honestly forgotten that I mentioned something to a friend and later, sometimes much later (months), if the subject is brought up, she’ll catch me in the “lie”. I normally get myself caught because I never felt like I originally lied, so I am just being honest in that moment and she'll stop me and say, ""you originally said this though, you lied"".

I will admit, I did intentionally lie about my first relationship 7 years ago because it ended for somewhat embarrassing reasons (nothing crazy that would make a current gf view me differently), but embarrassing to me and I intentionally omitted certain facts and was vague. I was honest about how it ended with my previous gf because she never asked about it and I felt comfortable enough to share that with her. Because my current gf asked so many questions, I felt pressured and admittedly was vague/lied. In another case, before any of my relationships, I was crazy about a girl from 4th grade into highschool. I originally told my gf that I lost interest and stopped communicating with this girl right after highschool when in fact I saw her once more (in a 24hr period, nothing more) in between my first and second relationship. My gf had asked me long time ago when I last communicated with this girl and I just quickly mentioned that it was right after highschool when she went away to college. I wasn’t intentionally lying since I simply didn't care to remember the details surrounding this girl because she meant nothing to me after highschool, but I do see from her point of view that clearly I omitted facts and lied to her face about it.

I am now honestly scared to talk about things in my past because I may mention something I did not mention originally and it will be construed as me intentionally lying. We got into a pretty big fight last night about it and I suggested a week long break so I could figure things out because I know lying isn’t in my character, but apparently I always do. I also mentioned she should take the week to determine if she would even want to be with a guy who does this all the time (not the time to say something like this, I know, but I feel awful for constantly lying). She said she didn’t want to a week to think about things so instead we are trying to work things out. She is also unhappy that I suggested she break up with me over this, though I made it clear that I do not want to break up with her.

To make a long fight short, she wants to work things out and talk about this more, even though we have had these conversations before after previous lies. 

Thanks for reading if you did… I suppose I am simply wondering if the relationship is salvageable. When a partner is caught repeatedly lying, how do you recover from that? If this was our only problem in the relationship, I probably wouldn’t be so hard on myself, but we do fight quite a bit about other things, usually things stirred up by my insecurity. Because I was not used to exes asking so many questions about my past, I had a hard time dealing with hearing about my gf’s past. I was doing pretty good in getting over things, but she ended up recently talking to one of her exes on the phone for an hour (something I was ok with initially) and he told her how much he loved her and such. Now my insecurities have sky-rocketed and I feel like my gf would fare well with someone who wasn’t a complete liar and was more confident.

TL;DR: My girlfriend has repeatedly caught me lying throughout the relationship. I do not meant to intentionally lie, I simply do not remember details or care to remember them well. She has a great memory, so if a topic is brought up months later and I offer up more information, it comes out that I originally lied or omitted certain things. One time, something concerning about why I broke up with my first gf about 7 years ago, I was intentionally vague about because I was embarrassed. How do you recover from something like this? How would you view your partner if you felt like they kept lying to you?"
27,"My parents are obsessed with me [24f] being a picky eater


 Tl;dr at the bottom of the text. 

Some background: I have been an extremely picky eater for as long as I remember. I don't eat a lot of things that are considered pretty normal (and loved) food, such as cheese, meat deli products, tomatoes, peppers, cabbage, olives, and God forbid I ever come across anything containing garlic or onions. It's not a matter of alergies or food intolerance, I just really cannot stand food that has a strong smell or has a weird consistency to me. As you can see, my food choice is pretty limited but I try to make the most out of it. My diet mostly consists of cereals, milk/yogurt, potatoes and rice cooked in many different ways, eggs, meat, fish, fresh fruit (veggies not so much but I eat a salad every now and then) and sweets. I am quite healthy and my weight hasn't changed much for the last 10+ years, and so far I haven't had any major health issues due to my limited diet.

My parents, on the other hand, are big foodies and will eat almost anything you serve them. They never seemed to understand why I reject to eat most foods, and keep pestering me whenever I reject a food offering or disagreed with the choice of our daily menu. 

Also, worth noting is that I have been living on my own in another city for the past 7 years. I either cook for myself or eat out, and so far I haven't starved to death or had any health issues. I usually come back to my parent's home one weekend per month, and every damn time I come here we have HUGE fights about choosing the food we will eat as a family while I'm there.

The issue:
Although for the past 20+ years of my life I haven't changed my opinion about any single type of food I dislike, my parents ""welcome"" me with an unsolicited lecture on the topic of food diversity and healthy eating every goddamn time I come back home. My mom is being brutal towards me whenever she brings up the topic of choosing tomorrow's lunch. Basically, she acuses me of being unfair towards them because I force them to come up with an idea that doesn't contain any of the foods I dislike. She then throws a HUGE fit, claims that she and my dad have failed as parents and blames me for ruining the family's peace whenever I come home. My dad is not as militant as her, but it I had a penny for every time he (politely) asked me to try a slice of tomato or a green pepper, I'd be the richest woman in town.

This is heartbreaking and nerve-wracking for me on so many levels. I grew up feeling ""not normal"" because I was the only kid that never ate pizza, hot dogs or sandwiches (yeah, like those are proper kids food), despite my parents' desperate efforts to trick me into eating them, offering to buy me stuff and take me places if I only eat a slice of pizza. They kept telling me that if I don't start eating like the other normal kids, I will never find real friends or someone who will love me and tolerate me. It took me years to realize that my friends are all either super understanding or just don't give a shit about what I order whenever we eat out. Note: I have never ever tried to convince anybody to stop ordering, cooking or eating the things I dislike, I am a 'live and let live' kind of person, as long as you aren't being too pushy making me try from whatever you are eating.

Anyway, I just got back home today, and for the umpteenth time I was welcomed by my mom's speech on Sunday family lunches and how important it is to have the whole family on the table - a tradition I ruin by being too picky, thus limiting my mom's food options to either potatoes or rice and nothing in between. I tried explaining that as long as all of us are sitting on the same table, it really doesn't matter if we all eat the same dish, but it only made matters worse because ""that's not what normal families do, and this is not a restaurant"". She kept on yelling to the point of me being on the verge of tears, and honestly I can't stand it anymore. Those damn fights about food are one of the reasons why I don't visit as often as I used to, and rarely spend more than a weekend at home.

I am not a picky eater because I seek attention or anything. I would have loved to be ""normal"" and able to eat anything my mom puts on my plate for the sake of peace, but it's just so much stronger than me, literally making me want to puke. I have learned to live like this, occasionaly trying new products, but have never been curious about the taste of, let's say, cheese. My diet is plain and simple, but that's how I like it.

I don't even know how to start approaching this problem. It frustrates me that as a grown-ass woman I am apparently not allowed to have my own taste in food and eat whatever I like without my mom throwing a fit. She is normally a very difficult and stubborn person to deal with, but whenever she scolds me on my diet choice I feel insecure and it leaves me upset, it's like being 8 all over again.

TL;DR: parents are constantly upset about my limited food choice and whenever we are supposed to have a meal together both me and my mom are on the verge of tears."
28,"Can I [20 M] be in love to a girl [20 F] that I haven't ever met IRL before?


Basically im 20 year old male and never had a girlfriend. Pretty lonely guy, i have some friends (in another city) that i can go out with sometimes or play games with online. But most of my time i spent alone in my apartment. Currently having probably the hardest time in my life, depressed and lonely, but its getting better as im taking a break from school since this january to focus on myself.

Met this girl in online game in late 2017, we started talking and it didn't take long ( about 2 months ) before we were pretty close. I feel like she is perfect, really beautiful, lovely voice, laugh, has been the only girl to ever show affection towards me, plays games and just really cool person.

Got a crush on her pretty fast after getting to know her, been thinking about her everyday since i got to know her in late 2017. Im the type to get a crush on every girl that i do something with.

Ever since i met her ive been feeling more lonely than ever, being alone and not having a girlfriend didnt ever bother me before but ever since we met ive been thinking about her so much (too much even and doing stupid things like checking 10 times a day if she is online or checking her snap location to see if she is home) and it just hurts to be alone in bed when i think about her. She lives in another country and i havent met her IRL yet, but we have said we would like to meet each other in the future.

When something happens i always send it to her first. And i cuddle with my pillow thinking about her. She used to be really kind and kinda flirty with me (said she would cuddle with me and none has ever said that to me). We have video chatted once and it was fun and not awkward. I instantly feel good when talking to her.

Now couple months ago she told that she has a boyfriend now and the boyfriend is her IRL best friend and she also lives with her now. I thought that this is good now i will stop thinking about her but i feel like lately it has been killing me. For example lately when i see a sex scene or watch porn i just end up thinking about them and then i feel physically bad. Today i was watching netflix and there was a passionate love scene and instantly my mind flashes with the image of him kissing her or touching her and i just feel physically bad, my skin crawls.

I feel good inside when talking to her, love talking to her, shaking and smiling and crying.

Sometimes when i look girls from behind in a bus for example and they look like her from behind i just end up staring them kind of.

Thinking way too much of her, but this is also because im lonely and depressed in my apartment.

Jealous of her boyfriend and would love to know every detail of their relationship just so i could imagine what is it like...

I've been crying for couple hours with some breaks and just thinking about her while listening to melancholic music. Today i made decision i want to stop thinking about her in unhealthy way and just enjoy our friendship, and funnily today i also kinda realized i may be in love to her, i never thought that before today.

**Can i be in love for her when I havent even met her IRL?**




TL;DR : Met a girl online from another country, she is kinda my best friend (im not hers though, altough we are close), have had a crush on her for a year almost and now she has a boyfriend and i want to get her out of my mind and stop thinking about her but its really hard and  today i realized i'm maybe in love with her."
29,"How should I go about with my crush?


So for the past 2 years I (M21) have been getting on really well with a work colleague (F25) from the moment I met her  I knew I liked her, and over this time I have slowly liked her more an more as we have grown from just work colleagues, to work friends, to just friends in general. She is quite possibly my ideal partner, we have loads of similar interests, she is a really good person and when ever we are together we spend hours laughing and just enjoying each others company, even all my friends and coworkers say that we are perfect for each other (many think we are already dating) and i think its safe to say that I am in love with her. 

&amp;#x200B;

Over the past year our friendship has become more serious, we see each other multiple times a week outside of work, we go on trips together and spend loads of time with each other. The problem is I am getting a lot of mixed signals, I really like her and I think its obvious that I like like her (all of my coworkers are aware I really like her) and at times she seems to give vibes that she likes me, she texts me constantly, wants to go on ""dates"" with me when ever she is free, has talked with me deeply about a lot of intimate stuff (everything from personal issues to her sexual preferences) we flirt constantly and she has recently become more ""touchy"" she'll do things like stand really close to me, hit and punch me (in a friendly manor) shuffle her arse up against mine. Now I am highly inexperienced with women, dating, crushes and signals so I don't know if this stuff is just friendly banter but I have never had a lass act like this around me before. 

&amp;#x200B;

But, at the same time she seems to keep reinforcing that we are just ""friends"", like at the end of a great day she will say ""I am so glad that we are friends"" and this is repeatedly which makes me feel like she is trying to say to me that we are just friends and that is all she wants, although I never push the idea that we would be anything else so this seems odd to me. On top of this I am aware that she never dates younger men and she has told me this directly (which again I am assuming is another hint) 

&amp;#x200B;

It is really tearing me up, I am absolutely smitten by her and i think about her all the time but I just don't know what to do, do I ask her out and risk jeopardising our friendship and making work awkward? Do I just keep going as I am enjoying her just as a friend? Do I just move on completely? Or should i do something else? 

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR: I am madly in love with my coworker/ friend but I don't know if she likes me back, what should I do?  "
30,"Advice Wanted: My [30sF] husband's [40sM] gender transformation obsession is ruining our relationship


Hi All.

Throwaway, obviously.

Background: I've \[32F\] been married to my husband \[40M\] for 4 years, together 5. We have two little kids together.

This is a pretty long story, but I will try to sum it up without leaving out too many important details.

When my husband and I first started dating, I was coming out of a divorce. We ended up taking a cross country trip together very early in our relationship. It was fantastic! Except for the part where I discovered he was still talking to other girls. I was heartbroken, but we had a chat about it... and that was the end of it. Except for the part where I'm not a very good partner and I developed trust issues/snooping behaviors because of it. So after a few months, I was using his computer for work when his AIM list popped up. I scrolled through it, because hey it was there, not expecting to find much. It was extensive... but whatever. Then I discovered a SN that I knew. It was one of my friends that I had met on the same website that I met hubby on. It was a guy. Wait... was he checking up on ME?! Soo after panicking a bit, I reached out to my friend and asked him if he knew \*insert SN here\*. And he told me yes, he knew that SN. That SN had messaged him some really weird stuff. Well, now I HAD to know wtf was going on. What is he messaging my friend about? My friend told me everything and then we actually set it up and caught hubby in the act. He had been messaging people under a fake female profile and talking about gender transformation. Like actually sending pictures with a whole complete backstory and everything. WTF???? A big fight/conversation ensues. I'm not okay with this, because he's basically cat fishing people and using other people's information. But eventually... we get past everything. I'm feeling like a good partner, trying to be understanding that everybody has their kinks and I'm promised that it won't happen again. I'm given excuses: it started out as an experiment and he did it while he was lonely/bored. I'm not completely happy with the relationship.

Then I get pregnant.

So I marry him, because that's what was expected and I needed the health insurance. For a long time, everything was really good! Or was it because I was so happy with a distraction and he was getting better at hiding it? I'm honestly not too sure. We ended up having another baby and things were going smoothly, or so I thought.

Guys. I caught him doing it again. He has done this repeatedly throughout the time we've been together, but this most recent discovery is really bothering me. This time I was smart and I didn't tell him HOW I knew. I just told him I knew what he was doing. And we had a HUGE fight about it. He demanded that I tell him how I knew and would not let up. I outright refused. We fought some more. He tried to make ME seem like the bad person. He seemed sad, like a puppy dog. Then for a couple days nothing happened. Christmas came and I suddenly got the new computer that I've wanted for years. And we haven't spoken of it since. I created a fake profile to monitor his activity and guess who was logged on just 3 days ago? Yup.

I'm not really sure what I'm asking of you guys. Support? Advice? Has this happened to any of you? Is this \*just a kink\*? Are straight, married guys really into gender transformation? Like, obsessed with it that they order gender bender eBooks on Amazon and create fake profiles of girls that have ""transformed"" to chat with other people about? It this just a fantasy, curiosity or is he gay? I've asked him this before and he can't explain it. He's curious about it all, but no, he's NOT gay. He doesn't want to be a female but he's curious as to what it's like. Have I mentioned that he lies a lot and is charming? Maybe I could handle the eBooks &amp; blogs about it... but the cat fishing thing is NOT cool. Especially as an adult.

At the beginning of our relationship, we had sex all the time. Our drives matched perfectly and I was so happy (probably part of the reason I stayed, TBH). But we didn't have sex for 9 months while I was pregnant with my daughter. Kind of understandable, I was sorta sick some of the times. But she's 8 months old now and we've only had sex maybe... 5 times??? I'm in my 30s, my libido is through the roof. I know he's older &amp; has health issues (asthma, Crohn's)... but is it me or is it him??? I bounce back from pregnancy like a champ, I'm 5'9"" and 140 lbs, I take very good care of myself. I get compliments all the time. I really don't think it's my physical appearance that's bothering him. It can't be the baby. She sleeps through the night and I do 95% of the work involved with her. I put on things that are sexy and I try so hard.

I just don't know where to go from here and that's why I'm turning to you guys. I'm at the point where I'm considering having affair to get what I'm missing from this relationship. At this point, it's not just the physical part. He's not there emotionally either. He's completely unhelpful and oblivious - just in his own world most of the time. And honestly, it's hard to be with someone who tells you one thing and then completely does another. I've tried to be open with him and communicate what I need... but it'll just always come back to this.

I know, I know... I should go to counseling. But what are they \*really\* going to tell me to do? I don't know that I want to be with him anymore but leaving is too difficult at this time. (I'm a SAHM with no income or family nearby). All I wanted out of life is a family, but this situation is not what I had in mind. :(

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

tl;dr

My husband seems to be obsessed with gender transformation and is talking to people online as a female. This is ruining our relationship and I don't know what to do."
31,"When is a good time to call my (31F) dad (73M) who stresses me out?


I'm an only child of divorced parents, and my father lives alone.  He is a deeply unhappy person and makes people around him unhappy.  His family won't talk to him and have sued him/written him off.  He's older and his health is not the best, so I like to call him daily (he can't text, it's waaaaay beyond his tech level) to make sure he's ok.  But 9 times out of 10, it puts me in a nasty mood because he's needy and very critical about my job, lifestyle, everything.  He's foreign-born, which complicates things because there's a higher level of expectation as the only child/daughter.  Not calling him at least once a day makes me nervous because of his age/health. I love him, but I just want a quick hello, not a long, drawn-out convo about my shortcomings, his stressors.  He's also in the middle of his second divorce, although since I've known him he has always been in the middle of some catastrophe, business or personal.     

&amp;#x200B;

I've tried to call in the mornings, but then he asks me to take the day to be with him (my work is flexible, I work from home).  I'm a bad liar, so it sound like an excuse when I decline because I could, technically, hang out with him.  When I call after the gym, well there go my endorphins.     

&amp;#x200B;

I see him once a week.  I think that is a reasonable amount of time since we live close by, but am curious what other people think.  My partner (M35) calls his parents maybe a 2 or 3 times a month, though they are much younger, American, and out-of-state.  I don't want to be an asshole and feel guilty because so many posts talk about enjoying your parent's older years.  But throughout his life, my dad has been self-serving.  He wants company just for company, doesn't matter who it is.  He just doesn't want to be alone.  He unloads, and criticizes, and doesn't ask about other people unless it benefits him.  He's not all bad, he has good qualities, for example he's very inventive, and has a strong work-ethic.  But he's terrible company, in person and on the phone.  FWIW I'm in therapy.  I need a solution because I used to call in the evening with a drink or cigarette in hand, but I don't want to rely on those crutches anymore.

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR:  When is the best time of day to call a parent that stresses you out?

32,"Bf [27M] and I [24F] have vastly different incomes and views on finances and it's driving a wedge between us. Can this be solved?


Throwaway for obvious reasons. I'm also on mobile so my apologies for any formatting errors. 

So, my bf and I have been together 5 years but we don't live together mainly because of his financial situation. 

He's back in school for a certificate, so he's not currently working. He has lots of credit card debt (I won't get into how much, but it's in the 5 figures), and so he can't get any credit cards right now. He mainly lives off of very little savings or selling things online, occasionally gets money from his parents (or me). He's really trying to get his life in order, working really hard at his new certificate and he's excited and passionate about school. He'd do anything for me, and he's proven this multiple times. Finances are just the one thing he really can't get ahold of. His parents are the same way, particularly his mom. She spends half her paycheque on an upscale apartment, travels frequently (4 trips planned this year), online shops and has zero retirement savings. To put it in perspective, she has cc debt, but instead of using her year-end bonus to pay it, she planned a trip to Europe. He's not as bad as his parents, as he doesn't spend frivolously. He doesn't drink much, doesn't smoke weed, doesn't spend any of his time doing useless things like tv or video games. He only spends when absolutely necessary. 

And then there's me. I make a high income and I have substantial savings (30-40k) outside my emergency fund. I have always been a bit of a finance nut. My parents own and operate a successful business and they taught me everything they could about saving. I enjoy making spreadsheets, tracking my budget and my investments, etc. I do treat myself to many things other people my age probably can't. I bring my bf on multiple vacations a year, I eat out regularlybecause I'm a huge foodie who loves to try new restaurants, and I can't be arsed to make a coffee at home so I generally spend my money on expensive lattes. 

My bf thinks I'm cheap, because I drive a normal 2015 car (nothing wrong with it other than the fact that it's not new). He also thinks I 'worry' too much about money, particularly on vacations, and it ruins the trips for him. I told him it's normal for people to budget even on vacations, which he said was BS. 

Most recently, I was booking a trip for the two of us and I wanted to fly instead of drive (1hour flight versus 9-10hours driving). Driving would mean that I miss an extra 2 days of work, since we'd have to spend 2 days travelling. He loves road trips  though and begged me. He said a car would mean we could get around the city and wouldn't have to get a hotel right in the centre, so I said fine and took the extra days off work. 2 days before the trip, he chose a hotel that was completely central to the city ($1300 for 4 nights), which eliminates the need for a car there anyways. Parking was $50 a day, and we wouldn't even be able to drive it out of the lot for everyday use without paying. At this point I complained because honestly flight tickets were cheap, and I hate road trips anyways. I didn't yell or say anything bitchy, but I did express my concern and pushed the idea of flying again so I wouldn't have to miss more work. I can see how I came off as complaining. 

BF went off at me. Basically he said I needed to chill the fuck out, that I wasn't even spending that much compared to what I have. I said he had no right to use my savings against me on a trip I was paying for. He said it was a turnoff that I complained about something as menial as parking. I had a spreadsheet for the trip budget which had expenses like food etc, because I was paying for 2 people. He said everything was a cost-worth analysis to me and it was annoying and stupid. He cancelled the trip after going off at me for 2 hours. He said he was grateful I was doing all this but complaining about parking was stupid. He didn't seem that grateful, and when I mentioned it, he said ''what do you want me to do? Stroke your ego?'' I cried for a long time after. He apologized the next day for being so harsh but held his ground and said that I had to stop taking finances so seriously. 

Like I said, I do treat myself. I travel, I eat out, I love books and I buy them for myself whenever I want. But, I do track my finances and I don't care about cars or road trips or anything, so I generally don't spend on those things. When we go out, I pay for our dates 100% (movies, snacks, food, any activities). He's very thankful about that stuff. 

So here we are, Reddit. How do I mitigate these kinds of financial habit differences with my SO? Besides finances, we are a perfect match and we are best friends. 

**TLDR; BF and I have waaaay different finance habits and it's driving a wedge between us. What to do?**

33,"My (24m) bf got annoyed with (23f)me asking him to add me to his group chat.


tldr: i asked for him to add me to group chat because they were making plans and instead of talking to them through him I just wanted to read the messages myself instead of waiting for screenshots from him or reading off his phone.  Is this weird?

&amp;#x200B;

First off I don't have any personal close friends because I lost them after college due to a fight which was a year ago.  I've started a full time job and havent found time to make close friends again.  While I have hung out with his friends that he's had since hs/middle school.  I've hung out with them about once a week or so.  

&amp;#x200B;

Recently an old friend of them is coming to visit whom i've also met twice when he visited last time.  I asked my bf to add me to group chat because they were making plans.  I felt left out honestly because I expected him to add me because he wanted me to include me and not because I asked.  I was a bit dissapointed but didn't take it out on him and asked him nicely if I could be invited to chat.

&amp;#x200B;

Instead he just says ""why"".  So i told him I wanted to be included and he said ""it's an old group chat anyways and youre always with me so I just tell them our plans"" I told him it would be nice to be included. and he said ""fine i'll add you, stop whining.""

&amp;#x200B;

I don't know why he made a big deal out of it.  Could it be because he wants space from me and his friend?  I was looking to see other opinions on this.

34,"Girlfriend (F19) broke up with me (M19) because I’m close friends with my ex girlfriend. (F20) Was I in the wrong?


My name is Isaiah, formerly known as Frankie.

So this is going to be split up into 2 parts. A brief detailing of my previous relationship. And how it has affected my current relationship.

I met my ex, Alondra, in 2012 when we were 13. We eventually started dating after being bestfriends for 5 months. We knew eachother’s darkest secrets. We both loved the same music. I went over to her house frequently as she lived close. Both of her parents worked so we had quite a lot of private time. We were more than a couple, we were bestfriends. We were THAT couple in highschool. We were unstoppable. I admit I was more on the clingy side. Writing love letters, never wanting to be apart, etc. To this day, I know secrets that she would never tell anyone. She’s one of (if not, THE) strongest girl I know, after having dealt with depression, anxiety &amp; a failed suicide attempt. She’s very mature for her age. Our relationship eventually ended in June of 2015 after being together for quite some years. There was no cheating or anything of the sort. She said that she just fell out of love. Was I the best boyfriend? No. Was she the best girlfriend? No. But we still appreciated &amp; were thankful of the time we had together. My relationship with Alondra taught me a lot. But the breakup wasn’t the cleanest. A lot of tears on my side. We stopped all communication in August 2015.

I’ve already coped &amp; am over the breakup &amp; relationship as a whole, but I will admit that this was very troubling at the time for me &amp; sent me into a massive depression. It affected my everyday life. I dropped out of school for 5 months. I even changed my first name from Frankie (my father’s name) to Isaiah (my middle name that my mother gave me.) And I changed from my father’s last name to my mother’s maiden name. No ill will towards my father at all, just wanted to change who I was. I also didn’t speak to anyone at this time. Contemplated suicide daily. I was a mess &amp; am quite embarrassed by it to this day. I was eventually diagnosed with Depression &amp; Social Anxiety in 2016 after being screened by a psychologist I had been seeing for quite some time.

Fast forward to early 2017. Even though I was still sheltering myself due to anxiety, I didn’t realize I was over the breakup until I ran into her in May of that year. I ran into her &amp; her then-boyfriend Steven (a guy I hated for a while considering they started dating just a few weeks after we broke up.) I walked into a Carl’s Jr. one day, her boyfriend noticed me &amp; we started having (what I thought was) a real good catching-up conversation. (I later found out he hated me due to the fact that I had dated Alondra for years &amp; was basically her “first” for everything.) I’m pretty sure Alondra was in shock to realize that her boyfriend &amp; ex boyfriend were having a friendly conversation. It wasn’t until that day I realized I was 100% over her. I was so fearful of running into her &amp; yet when the time came, it didn’t even phase me. I felt on top of the world. This did not lead me to talking to Alondra again.

Then in June of 2017 I met Angie. My current (ex) girlfriend. We met at a gaming convention. She noticed me on Twitter &amp; saw we were both there for the same reason (to meet our favorite youtuber.) We eventually met up &amp; spent the day together. She had a boyfriend at the time (he lived in Alaska while we lived in California) &amp; she made me aware of it so I kept my distance like any gentleman would. We spent that weekend hanging out at the convention. We met out favorite YTer &amp;  his GF together. (Who would later befriend us &amp; would invite us to hangout at places such as Disneyland. This would eventually bring me &amp;  Angie closer together.) We then went our seperate ways. She lived less than an hour away from me. We stayed in contact via Twitter &amp; texting. We didn’t talk often until around October 2017 when she would talk to me about troubles with her then-boyfriend. Their relationship eventually fell out. Then we became closer. I was surprised to see how much of a happy girl she was. She made me feel nothing but positivity. Not to mention she’s definitely the most beautiful girl I’ve ever seen, both inside &amp; out.

At the same time, I started talking to Alondra again in December 2017. We’re both the biggest Eminem fans in the world (his music was the reason we met in 2012). So she wanted my opinion on his latest album, Revival, at the time. This was the start of a new friendship between us. We had both grown, didn’t speak for almost 3 years, gotten over the relationship, became entirely new people. We had our time together as highschool kids, but now we’re adults in college &amp; are over the past. It felt good being friends with her again. She even called me Isaiah instead of Frankie. It affirmed me that I had become a new, better person. We didn’t talk everyday but we had meaningful conversations every so often about things such as our anxiety &amp; depression &amp; other things of the sort. She also broke up with her boyfriend because he had anger problems, was verbally abusive, and was controlling. He was the reason she never really spoke to me before because he wouldn’t allow her to.

Now back to Angie. We made plans to see eachother for the first time in a long time in January 2018. We were already falling for eachother &amp; wanted to know how it would feel be in eachother’s presence again. So we hungout, met up at a restaurant, went to the mall, and eventually went back to her place. We made love that same night. After that she agreed to be my girlfriend.

For months, things went smoothly. I was in a (what I thought was a) healthy relationship with Angie. I had become friends with Alondra again. My life was back on track.

Now here’s where the bad comes in. In April 2018, out of guilt Angie admitted to me that she only started dating me for my body. She said she wasn’t sexually fulfilled by her previous relationship since her ex lived in Alaska &amp; we lived in Cali. She said she was only with me for the first couple of months because I was her only source for sex &amp; physical fulfillment. But she said that overtime she had grown emotionally attached to me &amp; begged me to stay. Now as you can imagine I was very emotionally distraught over this. I had never experiened this before. I felt so violated. That was the worst I had ever felt in my life. I needed time to myself. I had nowhere else to turn so I turned to Alondra.

I vented &amp; told everything to Alondra. I told her what Angie did &amp; how it was affecting me. Because it made me want to kill myself. It made me wonder if sex was all I was worth. It made me feel worthless. So I vented to Alondra. After this, she invited me to have lunch with her &amp; another guy friend to help get my mind off things. So I spent the day with her &amp; our friend. It was crazy considering we hadn’t really seen eachother or spent time in literal years. This was the beginning of mine &amp; Alondra’s bestfriendship.

Eventually, I forgave Angie &amp; took her back. (Which was probably an unhealthy decision but that’s not what this was about.) Though this did lead me to having trust issues &amp; a spike in my mental illness. But things started to get better between me &amp; Angie. Except for two things. One, I caught her texting her ex about how she “misses him” &amp;  how she still has gifts from him. And two, she HATED that I was friends with Alondra for the simple fact that she was my ex.

I’ve never been the type to go snooping through phones, but when I was staying over her house one weekend, I noticed she was being very weird with her phone. She usually doesn’t care where her phone is or if it was locked or not. But I noticed she always kept her phone away from me. She even went to take a shower, and STEPPED OUT of the shower to come get her phone because she “forgot” it. Who does that? She NEVER does that. I felt suspicious. I opened her Macbook because all of a person’s iMessages show up on their Mac if they’re logged into the same Apple ID. And sure enough I found the messages between her &amp; her ex talking all mushy to eachother. I was mad &amp; sad. Now I’ve never been the loud &amp; angry kind, so I just gave Angie the “emotionless” treatment for a few minutes until I got her to admit what she did. I can tell it caught her offguard that I found out. She cried &amp; begged me to forgive her. I just told her to delete his number, delete their photos, and throw away any gifts he had given her that were mentioned in the texts. She complied, or atleast I thought she did. Months later she would get angry because “she wasn’t allowed to talk to her ex while I could.” 

This lead to many problems. Angie had the passwords to all my social media &amp; would go through my phone whenever she wanted. And everytime she never found anything. Because there was nothing to find. I tried to tell her that there was nothing between me &amp; Alondra. Alondra &amp; I dated in highschool. Went 3 years without seeing eachother. Alondra even got a new boyfriend during this time. Yet Angie was SURE that I was cheating on her with Alondra. I didn’t hangout with Alondra often, but when I did, there was ALWAYS atleast one other person there. Whether it be another guy friend, or Alondra’s boyfriend, there was always somebody else there. Me &amp; Alondra didn’t even see eachother as exes because we were completely different people. We’re adults now.

Whenever I hungout with Alondra, I always responded when Angie would call or text me. I sent her pics to prove other people were always there. She would read my text messages. She would get angry &amp; say it wasn’t fair that I could talk to my ex but she couldn’t talk to hers. Yet she would still accuse me of sleeping with Alondra. Yes, it is suspicious for a person to spend time with an ex especially if its late like 2a.m. but I was as transparent with Angie as a person could be. I’m also very clingy, so I did everything I could to remind Angie that was my #1. She was still top priority. If I had the choice of spending time with Angie or spending time with Alondra &amp; friends, I ALWAYS chose Angie. I only hungout with Alondra when I wasn’t able to spend time with Angie. Which was only like 2 times a month. I’m also the sober friend of the group. Angie knows this. She knows about my distaste for alcohol yet she still thinks I’m gonna get drunk &amp; have sex with Alondra. Me &amp;  Alondra do NOT see eachother like that. We had our time together during highschool but now we’re over it.

I felt it wasn’t fair to abandon Alondra &amp; my other friends because they didn’t do anything. Angie would constantly throw it in my face that there’s a possibility of me cheating on her. I eventually put my foot down &amp; told her I’m not gonna ditch Alondra because she’s a great friend.

Angie eventually left me because she couldn’t “take it anymore” &amp; now I’m left so confused. Was I really in the wrong? Could I have done something else to assure her that she was my one &amp; only? I can’t help but blame myself for this. I miss her so much.

TL;DR Girlfriend doesn’t like my female bestfriend because we dated in highschool. Did everything to assure my girlfriend that there is nothing between us. She still left me. Am I in the wrong for being close friends with an ex?"
35,"My Best friend (22m) and I (25f) were in love but now I feel like I was just being manipulated


Hey, so I've been best friends with this guy now for about 6 months who I ended up falling in love with. We've known each other for a few years but back in August we started to get really close. We told eachother we loved eachother and that we felt like soulmates. At this point we were talking and seeing eachother almost every day.

When we finally confessed feelings at the end of November he freaked out and told me he couldn't lose me and if we were dating that means I would eventually see the real him and leave him and he couldn't lose me like that.  So I said we could just be friends and he said no he couldn't stand to see me with someone else but I deserved better then him. He then just got up and left and we didnt talk for a week.

Then when we talked he said he loves me too much to date me so we should be friends, but all of our interactions after that end up being more relationship like then before. He ends up spending the weekend and Christmas with me and my family and also comes with me to visit my sister (4 hr drive)on NYE. We stayed for a few days. Things always end up more then friends when we are drunk and he confesses how much he loves me and says no one understands him the same and he cant be without me but then the next morning he will friendzone me until I treat him like a friend then he will be coupley towards me again pulling me back and forth. I didnt mind it because I understood that hes going through alot and not in a good place so I understood why he wouldn't want to date but obviously when you have feelings and attraction it's hard to help it sometimes. 

Fast forward we are on our way back from my sisters and he starts saying how it seems like I still like him but he wants to reminds me we are just friends and he doesnt feel the same and isnt attracted to me. I start crying because all the more then friendly interactions are ones he initiated and not even a week ago he was saying he wants to date me and is in love but I deserve better then who he is right now. He doesnt comfort me while I cry, just turns the music up and ignores me. 

As the ride goes on I start to realize more and more how one sided everything has been, how much I've helped him and how he is the one who said he wanted friendship but kept crossing lines. He starts to notice the change in my energy towards him and gets increasingly mad. We arent speaking at all but when we get to the gas station says I have an attitude. After that he starts driving really fast and i start to get scared.Doesnt say a word until we park and says "" I can feel how much you hate me all the sudden.  If this is how you're going to treat me from now on we cant be friends anymore"". I say calmly that I understand because at this point I started to feel afraid and really was not attracted to him anymore. He slams the door and puts all of his stuff in his car acting as If he is going to leave. Then he runs back and says ""so what do you want to do??"" And I say I thought we are no longer friends. He says ""that's not what I said, dont twist my words I'm doing this for you since you cant stand just being friends with me so what do you want ?"" And I said calmly again I'm fine with being friends and do not feel an attraction at all anymore. He laughs and says I'm lying to myself how could I possibly be attracted to him that morning but not now.  I tell him he can believe what he wants but I'm ok with just a friendship And he says ""well that's not what I want. I dont want to be friends. Did you ever think maybe I still have feelings and need space? Not saying that's what it is. I'm not saying we wont be friends. But I need space"" and slammed my door and left.

I feel so confused and lost. I feel like all of the sudden I can never see him the same.. in the 6 months we were so close we never once even argued and he never got angry with me. This is the first time hes ever yelled at me. Obviously I do not want to ever date him now. But I dont know if I could even still be his friend or not. I dont know how to feel. It's like I saw a completely different person then my best friend. Sorry if this is confusing.  I just feel like I'm probably going to be advised to cut him out and I don't know what I should do to cope with it all. Or how to deal when he does text me eventually.  Is it wrong of me not to want to be friends after this? I really care about him and love him, but I do not want to be used and that's how I feel now.

Tldr: in love with my bestfriend , had a realization that he has been using manipulating me in alot of ways, dont know how to cope"
36,"I [27M] am going away for two nights in April but my gf [26F] says I can't leave her with our baby


My gf and I were blessed with our first child on New Year's Day. We had an extremely difficult time at first after having a nightmare labour and spending a week in hospital, but now we are home I hoped things would be brightening up. The kid is perfect and I am overjoyed with him and so is she, most of the time. She is struggling emotionally after having an emergency c-section and spends most evenings in tears. I understand and try to be some comfort, she tells me I have been amazing.

Until that is today when the hiking boots I had ordered were delivered. This reminds her of the mountain climbing trip I have planned for two nights in April and she basically has an emotional breakdown. Despite us agreeing several months ago (admittedly reluctantly) that it would be fine and it's enough time after the birth for the baby to have a good routine and for her to be OK with it, she is now sobbing uncontrollably, telling me if I go she will leave me and take the kid, calling me a selfish prick. We agreed that because I am doing a law degree that she would do the lions share of looking after the baby, but now she throws that back in my face and tells me I don't care about my son at all. I've gone from ""amazing"" to a horrible arse hole. I counter that people with babies still go places sometimes. If I had a job that required me to take a business trip, would I be able to go despite having a child? I offer to call her mother and ask her if she's free to lend a hand in April. Everything i say is met with further sobs, accusations.

I understand she is struggling with the new born. But I frankly don't believe her rationale for not wanting me to go for the simple reason that any time I have ever wanted to go anywhere without her she throws a fit and thinks of some reason I absolutely cannot go. I couldn't go to my friends stag do because she was pregnant. I couldn't go to my works Christmas party because there are girls and alcohol there and she's not invited. I guarantee if I said I wanted to go climb a mountain next year insteas she would say I can't leave her with a 1 year old. If I said I wanted to go in 2021 she's say I can't leave her with a 2 year old.

But I digress. Am I being blind to her side of the argument here? Maybe I am being selfish. I have the time booked off work as do my friends, I bought the gear, it's all planned. I feel like it's not such a big deal to go for two nights. I feel like if the situation were reversed I would miss her but I would handle it.

Please tell me if I am being an arsehole here. In the heat of argument I have said nasty things to her and I feel awful. I don't want to give in to her on this mountain trip if she is being unreasonable but I can no longer tell if she is, or I am.

Tl;dr - my gf agreed it was OK for me to go on a hiking trip for two days leaving her with the baby, now has changed her mind and is threatening to leave me over it. "
37,"Please please help me (30m) Say Goodbye (6F) During Breakup (29F)


Yesterday, I found out that my GF of the last four years has cheated on me on more than one occasion. Our relationship has been rocky (surprise surprise). I'm leaving a lot of the details of it out because that's not the focus of the post. I know there's only one path (on the very very long road) back to sanity for me.  Plans for the separation of everything is well underway and I am ready to pull the trigger for my disappearing act at a moment's notice.

&amp;#x200B;

She brought a kid into the relationship, who I've helped raised for the last four years, in what has been the absolute highlight of my life. Real dad is a bad, physically abusive dude, which she witnessed at a young age. Since the breakup he has never been around much, sees her every few months for an hour or so. I've been the only father figure she's known. She's told me, when no one else is around that I'm her real dad. That she's scared what will happen if something goes wrong between me and her mom (almost like she had a sixth sense.) I would adopt her without hesitation if the opportunity had been presented. She is an amazing kid, brilliant, beautiful, funny and I can't imagine life without her. To the point where I have completely sacrificed my self-esteem and sanity relationship just to stay in her life.

&amp;#x200B;

I would love to keep seeing her and to stay in her life, but I can't see mom letting that happen.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm in tears writing this, in two hours from now I'm supposed to pick her up from school and I will have a couple of hours alone with her in what very possibly (probably?) could very well be the last time I ever see her. Most important for me is what is best for her, I won't talk bad about mom to her. I have a Nintendo Switch meant for her birthday in a couple months, do I give her that? What do I tell her? What can I say? If you had a stepparent who left, what would you have wanted to hear?

&amp;#x200B;

I'm heartbroken, I have no idea what to do. Any advice at all is welcomed.

&amp;#x200B;

tl;dr GF is a ho. I've spent the last four years raising a daughter that I've come to see as mine. Not a chance mom lets me see her post breakup. How the shit do I say goodbye in the best way for both of us."
38,"My 4 year relationship ended because I was taken advantage of my a colleague. I still love him and want him back but he seems to have reservations...


***TL;DR I was taken advantage of by someone while working abroad, was too afraid to tell my boyfriend, when I got home things got weird. I thought it was because of issues in our relationship so broke up with him, turns out it's because of being taken advantage of. I'm still in love with him and want him back but he says it's too late now. (Apologies this is so long, but please read and give advice, I'm losing my mind and don't know what to do.)***

&amp;#x200B;

My boyfriend (24) and I (F23) had been together for just shy of 4 years, living together for 2 and a half and were very much in love and incredibly happy. I was working abroad last summer while my boyfriend continued living back home. I was working 1-1 with a guy 10 years my senior, we had a great friendship and I trusted him completely until one night when we got drunk he took advantage of me.  
I was horrified at the time that it had happened and absolutely petrified about the whole situation. I told 1 friend but chose not to tell my boyfriend, I was just so shocked and didn't know what to do so thought it would be for the best. Unfortunately at the time I didn't have the strength to tell my employers about it so had to continue working with this person for another 6 weeks or so (they know now and the person has been dealt with).

&amp;#x200B;

During this time, because I felt I had no choice, I just had to carry on and 'deal with it'. I tricked myself into thinking I was ok because I had got through the duration of our time working together. Don't get me wrong it was obviously horrible but I think it almost turned into a Stockholm syndrome sort of situation. My boyfriend came out to visit me about a month after it happened and met the person, it was quite awkward but we didn't have to really see him but the whole time I had this guilt hanging over me that I should tell him but I couldn't bring myself to do it. I was so embarrassed and worried of what he might think, that he might leave me, that I might have to leave my job etc. Also I knew it would break his heart.

&amp;#x200B;

Fast forward to when I returned home at the end of the season, obviously I had been a bit 'off' and 'different' since the incident and hadn't really been myself. Contact between us had thinned out a little for sure but I just put it down to both of our busy working schedules, I was working 7 days a week and he had a full time day job but lots of freelance projects too. I was feeling very anxious about coming home, it was his birthday as soon as I got back and we were solidly busy for the first 2 weeks. I felt like I didn't really have a chance to settle back in before being so busy, that's something I've always struggled with is not having time in-between big events. Also because I thought I had emotionally dealt with the 'incident' from the summer, when I started having these feelings towards my boyfriend including things like not wanting to be touched or being intimate, even just talking was really difficult. I felt like I'd entered into some sort of prison and I couldn't escape, I became quite snappy and rude and unpleasant to be around. And as I say, because I thought I had dealt with everything already, I mistook these feelings to just be about my boyfriend and our relationship. I thought it was signals that we shouldn't be together anymore. Because of this I broke up with him.

&amp;#x200B;

Almost immediately I think I knew it was a mistake but it took me a few weeks to fully understand what was happening and that actually all those feelings and thoughts I was having was because of the incident with my colleague. I hadn't properly dealt with any of it, just pushed it deep down inside in order to carry on working. I've since done some research into this sort of thing and these are actually quite normal/common reactions for people who have been in my situation. Also the fact that I was taking the breakup way harder than I anticipated, I thought surely if I don't love this person anymore then I wouldn't be feeling like this. But obviously as he was still totally unaware of my situation he had to take what I was saying at face value. And I completely broke his heart.

&amp;#x200B;

This was about 6 weeks ago, since then there was a death in the family and then with the flurry of Christmas and New Years it's been non-stop. I desperately wanted to talk to him before Christmas and tell him what happened, how I was feeling and that I'd made a horrible mistake in ending things, that I was still so in love with him but thought I'd already done enough damage and didn't want to ruin his time away with his family over the 2 weeks he was away. So I waited until he was home, went to see him and told him everything (5 days ago). He was of course shocked and upset that it had happened, but understandably he thought when I ended it that it was for real and therefore had spent that time just trying to accept it and deal with it. He said that things just weren't sitting right with him now and that it'd be too much to go back now, that our breakup highlighted some incompatibilities. Which of course I understand, I totally can see it from his perspective and how much I hurt him and how confused he must be feeling.

&amp;#x200B;

I just wish I had had the courage sooner to speak to him and tell him how I felt. He was my future, we had so many dreams and things we wanted to do together. He was the person I saw myself getting married to and having a family with. He is absolutely everything to me and now I've lost it all. Last week would have been our 4 year anniversary. Please any advice on what to do now regarding my relationship with him would be so appreciated. I feel so lost and confused and I just don't know what to do."

Just curious what are people's thoughts on staying together knowing that there's an end date and enjoying each other's company while you can or best to cut ties because you're just going to enter a world of hurt.

Of course there is no right or wrong answer and only an answer that fits well for us but I was just curious on the different sides of the situation if it happened to you.

tl;dr I like this girl but I couldn’t bring myself to tell her the truth about contacting my ex. Somehow she found out I lied and I don’t know how she did but now I feel bad cuz I told her I’d keep it real with her

I (22m) have been exclusive with this girl (25f) (let’s call her A) on and off for a year and she has been asking me about my ex and asking me if I still hit her up. I kept it real and said my ex blocked me but I lied when she asked me if I’ve ever tried reached out to my ex while seeing her. 

Then the next day, A texts me and says “Are you going to email her Happy New Years too?”

How did she find out I emailed my ex Merry Christmas? She called me a fraud and now I feel bad. She blocked me on everything. How do women know shit? I doubt she went through my phone because the last time I saw her the last thing that happened was she gave me a xmas gift before telling me goodbye. She wouldn’t have given me a gift that day if she went through my phone and found everything out about myself and my ex. 

But I felt bad and texted her the next day and said “On some real shit, I’m sorry if I ever put you through anything or hurt you in any way, it wasn’t my intentions” and she replied back saying “you should really throw away the word “real” from your vocabulary, and for the record you never got to me to the point where you can hurt me.”

43,"I [23F] is wondering if I my text sounded I’m admitting that I was in the wrong


Basically has an argument over something something she got offended by. What I said has nothing to do with what she is offended about but she just blocked me and said I didn’t just drop it so I was “disrespectful”. We ended up making up. I then texted a few days later making sure this doesn’t happen again 





Hey I felt we didn’t have a middle ground so that it doesn’t happen again since it has happened a few times. So like I said before, I feel like I am being silenced if I immediately have drop the topic once I been accused of xyz. I think I should have to explain my side too. Just like how you felt I wasn’t respecting your feelings, I feel just “dropping” the topic once you said I’m “wrong for that” isn’t respecting my voice.  

I think giving my side is important, cause like the last mess, I was talking about race percentage based on parents while your issue was skin color and what you identify as. It makes sense for me to give you a clarification and that I was not saying light skin =\= black. 

Once we both briefly give sides we should just respectively end it. So you don’t feel I’m disrespecting your feelings and I don’t feel I’m being silenced. 

Long story short, we both briefly express it with no shade or aggression and agree to disagree lol. I believe this will make our friendship better because we can talk things out without having any hard feelings, which all friendships should be. 

&gt;I feel just “dropping” the topic once you said I’m “wrong for that” isn’t respecting my voice.  

Is where I’m concerned. I made a typo saying “said” instead of “say” so the “said” makes it seem like I’m talking about our past argument which also doesn’t makes sense with the sentence. I don’t want her to think that I was on the wrong “cause I’m not”. Do you think you could have misinterpreted of me saying that I was in the wrong?

I know I could just correct her but it’s awkward because I already brought it up again and I can tell she is done with it. Will be awkward having to text her again about a minor typo when we kinda had many other convos after that.

Do you think she could have misread it as me saying im wrong?

TL;DR: not sure if I’m overthinking

During New Years, I was over at a cousins place where they had a Party. I’ve been very good friends with a family friend of my cousin’s for a while. We’ve known each other for a few years and we get along well. He’s a very affectionate friend to begin with, however, as we were hanging out before I was sleeping over, he was loosely holding my hand or putting his arm around me. He even stayed with me until I fell asleep. It would be an understatement to say I was super confused, as I’ve never been in a situation like that to begin with. So I just sat there blankly and went with it. What does it mean? Is he just being his affectionate self or is he (as a friend calls it) majorly hitting on me?"

48,"boyfriend getting messages from other girls advice


I have been with my boyfriend for about 6 months, he’s my first serious relationship and it’s been pretty good but we have had some bumps. Sometimes these bumps are hard to figure out if they’re “big” or “small” since relationship stuff is still semi new to me. 

The problem is when we fight he likes to call me names, swear, and he has such a bad habit of blame shifting. My main issue from this post is something that happened today.

I was on my way to my boyfriends house (I take a city bus to get around) and he sends me a message, he tells me “just so he can have more people on snap” he added all these girls he saw on someone’s story. He explains he “accidentally messaged all of them” when he meant to send something to his friends on snap and it happened cause they were in his recents and he wasn’t paying attention but that one girl in particular wouldn’t stop messaging him. This was super out of ordinary for him but I was just confused. He told me that he tried to ignore her messages, but she wouldn’t stop so he started replying since he felt bad. I told him if this was an issue to simply remove her, he wouldn’t have to ignore anything and he didn’t even know her. But he went on saying “he feels bad removing someone” but I said he doesn’t even know the girl. I was frustrated in general why he would tell me all this because i’m not sure what response he wanted from me? I asked him this exact question and he said “because you’re coming over and I don’t want you to think i’m cheating.” 

I do believe him and what he said though, I know the snapchat he added all the girls on and I know it was posted that day. But from this I did react, I told him what he told me made me uncomfortable and that I did want her removed. I’m not sure if that’s too far cause I have no proof he was doing anything wrong and he is allowed to talk to other girls, but how he approached me about it did worry me. He got mad and said he was ignoring her messages and that my request was “crazy” and “psychotic” and then compared me to one of his friends ex girlfriends who has a bad reputation for being crazy. Instantly I was hurt, he was blaming me for having a reaction to such a weird thing to tell me, I told him I didn’t want to talk anymore over text and I will talk to him once i’m there. He tried to call me but I declined and said “We can talk in person” but he called me 4 more times afterwards, and texted me after saying “you’re acting childish” and i’m not sure what he meant but also said “and when it comes back to get you don’t come at me.” 

On the bus I tried to hide my tears from everyone else, and when I got to his place I broke down in front of him and he apologized and told me he didn’t like seeing me cry and that she was removed and proved it. I even apologized and said I shouldn’t of gotten mad but he I didn’t like when he called me names, all he said was “I just commonly use words like psychotic and don’t think they’re hurtful when I say it.” 

That same day I notice he got a message from another girl, probably one he also added. He noticed I saw the notification and tried to play it off. She messaged him “hey” and he just said “haha what does this even mean?” I told without looking up at him just to ignore it but I noticed later he did message back. I asked him why he replied and he instantly got defensive saying “I can’t do anything right, and I don’t know what I can or can’t do anymore.” I ignored what he said and a minute later he cuddled into me and said he loved me.

Near the end of this same night, we were discussing how someone wanted to make plans with us and we were waiting for a message back from him, I haven’t gotten a message and I asked my boyfriend if he had. He checked his phone and he did but there was another notification from yet ANOTHER girl, it seemed like he did not want to open it in front of me because he changed the subject and started acting super nice to me, almost like out of character nice until I left that night. 

I’m not quite sure what to do from here. I know these girls are all new and he did add them all that day but I feel so uneasy about it and I know I have no reason to but it’s just so out of character for him. Is it worth mentioning again? and saying what? I just want to make sure i’m not being crazy because he can talk to girls but this just really throws me off.

50,"Me (F20) and my boyfriend (M20) are struggling re. to sex.


TLDR at the bottom and an apology for formatting, I’m on mobile.

Me and my boyfriend have been together for almost 3 years now. They haven’t been an easy 3 years but we’ve survived and now we’re here.


For the first month of our relationship, he almost cheated on me with his ex. She was constantly messaging him trying to meet up with him, and the sweet naive man he was, didn’t realise her intentions were to make him cheat to then she could break us up. It was only when I realised what was going on and said “me or her” did he realise and thankfully chose me.


Ever since then, sex for us has been rocky. The first few months of our relationship was either spent at our respective parents house, or at university halls so we really never had the chance to explore sex properly with each other. As such, to the point where I thought I was asexual and he agreed that he may be as well (this is important later). After almost half of our relationship being spent under parents’ roofs or in close proximity to others, this just cemented that belief, and I had signed off having sex for the rest of my life.



One day, I caught him watching porn, and was shocked. After some further questions he admitted to me he had lied about being asexual because he didn’t want me to feel like I was to be forced into sex, and had been looking at porn at least 2 times a day. This shocked me as I genuinely believed he was asexual. Wanting to see if maybe I was wrong, we started having regular sex and it wasn’t too bad. This was this summer just gone, and it was pretty good!



One time we were having sex though, something happened and one of the veins on his penis broke. Queue blood everywhere and he passed out, it was a really horrible event. All was sorted, abstained for a few months to let it heal fully, but our relationship hasn’t.



We’ve stopped having sex again, and he barely kisses me. I’m the one who has to kiss him first, initiate anything and I feel like I’m doing it for his sake. He doesn’t want to touch me anymore, and I know it’s probably due to the traumatic event but I don’t know what I can do to help. He won’t speak to me about it, he won’t speak to a doctor, or mental health professional. I’m at an end here and I don’t know where to turn.


TLDR; boyfriend broke his penis during sex and fainted. Hasn’t had proper sex with me since the incident (7 months) and won’t talk to anyone at all "
51,"My [19M] boyfriend’s friend is obsessed with me [20f]/our relationship


My boyfriend’s friend, R, who I have never met, is acting really weird in regards to me and I cannot understand why. R is not even very close to my boyfriend and they only know each other from class.

About a month ago, he started asking my boyfriend if we could all go to lunch together. Not super weird—but he kept asking. Probably 5 or 6 times. He’s been insanely insistent about this, creating group chats etc. He’s also said things to my boyfriend like “wow you have a girlfriend” “good job on her” 

Today, he commented on one of my pictures on facebook of my boyfriend and I at the beach saying that my boyfriend looked cute. I replied jokingly “what about me” and he then said “sorry I don’t think I should be calling my friends girlfriend cute but do you want to get dinner?”

52,"I [19M] just broke up with my [18F] girlfriend


So we broke up, no sugar coats no nothing. This is the first relationship that I've ever been in, only lasted two months and I'm very saddened about what happened. She broke up with me 3 days, don't want to go into detail about the breakup.

I introduced her to my best friend, and they became really good friends. Like really close and good friends, and I loved how the person I loved was great friends with my best friend of 6 years. Not too long ago I meet up with him [let's call him person Z]. I had suspiciousness from person Z that he was doing more than he should to my girlfriend, as in flirting, ish. He denied, but because when I hung out with my gf she would constantly bring up person Z. So when we meet up I told him everything, and he was being super honest. She invited him to drive up to see her (keep in mind she lives about 60 miles away), to watch a movie Together. I was thinking so what, theyd go see a movie as friends. What confused me is how neither brought it up. 2 days later I told her about it and how it made me uncomfortable, and she didn't like that, made herself distant and broke up.

She definitely didn't want to save the relationship, not even try. I was devastated because I really liked this person but I'm passed that now thank God. Her and my best friend are still in contact, like when we would hang out he'd check his phone for almost every 10 seconds responding to her snaps and texts. she's definitely not sad, which has made me believe that she chose me over him. So what I'm trying to ask, is that should I forgive my best friend and move on? I asked if he'd have a relationship with her and he didn't deny. I completely cut her out, but I'm thinking about doing that to my best friend too. Should I? he constantly reminds me of her too so that's a no good.

[TL:DR] I had suspicions that my gf and my male best friend were doing things beyond being ""friends"". I don't forgive my GF but I really don't want to end relationships with my best friend of 6 years. Should I? he constantly reminds me of her, and he's not planning on moving away from her anytime soon. Thanks. in advanced "

So I know the stereotype is that guys would be all over this, but as I respect my wife and my marriage, I have some concerns.

First, I know that my wife and her friend have had encounters in the past, so I dont want to open up a can of worms if there are some lasting feelings.

Second, I def dont want this to be a regular thing, which helps that her best friend lives a few states away. Still, I dont want that to he expected when she visits.

Third, her best friend is married but separated. Would we be disrespecting her marriage? I mean, shes an adult and can make her own decisions, but I dont want to do any damage.

Lastly, for anyone who may have done something like this before, how did it have a lasting effect on your relationship? I can understand having a random hookup and not speaking with the person again (which we have done), but that's her best friend since childhood. I'm not so sure it's a great idea.

My brother studies overseas, and he *used to* date this girl who is my girlfriends best friend. I came over to visit and that's how we met. Even though we live miles away, I have been visiting her for months at a time. Our longest time apart has been only 2 months.

I have dated many girls in the past and she is by far the best thing that has happened to me and I am madly in love with her.

My mum's a christian, loves my gf (lets call her A) very much too but will obviously never let me convert.

I do not believe in any god

A is the youngest girl i've ever dated and is by far the most mature in terms of mindset and the one I connect on MUCH deeper levels with. She comes from a very religious Muslim family background and they are SUPER STRICT with her. They even have tracking apps downloaded in her phone to know where she is 24/7 but of course there are ways around that such as a fake location apps that allows her to travel to other places with me. Her parents DO NOT know about me. She tried coming clean about me and asked her parents what if she loves someone who does not share the same belief and they just told her if she does her morals are not there... something like that.

&amp;#x200B;

Anyway she graduates in about June where she would go back to her home country after. Was thinking of proposing to her around then after then so her parents would let me move in with me or travel the world with me as a digital nomad.

I want to stay engaged as I do not want to spend loads of money on a stupid ceremony.

I do not know if I should try to get her parents to like me first? Meet me? I feel that I'm great around other people but based on the stories i've been hearing about how strict/closed minded they are makes me quiver in my damn boots.

At most i get blisters 6 times a year and at best around 4, its not a big deal but at the same time i feel it is. it runs in my family but im the only one it is active on, it has been slowing down allot over the years tho. as a kid i would get them all the time now that ive mostly grown up my immune system counters it for the most part. idk what to do or if we should even be together. i made a reddit account and found this /r to get this off my chest. if you have any insight or you resonate with me feel free to reply. this is really hard to post

 \*\*TL;DR; : What am i supposed to do in a relationship where i cant kiss my partner?\*\*. "
63,"How can I [34m] convince my recently single friend [23f] that there is someone better out there for her.


So I [34m] have been attempting to comfort my friend [23f] who once again broke up with her boyfriend [25m] for like the 100th time. I tell her all the time that it's obviously not meant to be and she should move on and look for someone else. But her reasoning is that she won't find anyone better. I'm sure there are all kinds of things involved with this line of thinking (low self-esteem, chemical attraction, etc.], but I'm personally sick of seeing her hook back up with the same guy over and over just to have them break up again like clockwork. Any tips on convincing her there's someone better out there (maybe better isn't the right word?)? I know it's none of my business, but she's my friend and it pains me to see her routinely hurt.

tl;dr how to convince friend [23f] to stop breaking up and getting back together with the same guy [25m] over and over."
64,"I (16M) am gay, my father (37M) is extremely homophobic while my mother (38F) is subservient to him. I don't know if I'm in a place where I can tell them but I just want to get out.


I've known I'm gay for about 2 years now. It was a very hard process accepting myself after being raised in a very religious and homophobic environment, but I can now say I accept myself completely. The problem I'm currently facing is that my dad is extremely homophobic, more so than anyone I've ever met. I feel very depressed and I hate living with them.

My father is very religious and he has always specifically hated gay people. He has often advocated for them to be put to death and claims it is a choice and anyone who chooses it has some serious mental issues. He continues to shout his beliefs at any chance he gets and I think it has really hurt my mental health.

My mom is accepting but subservient to my dad. She tries to downplay how hateful he is and gets surprised and angry whenever my dad expresses his views. I think she is in denial about how bad he really is. I'm worried if I came out to her she would either believe its a phase and tell my dad or just tell my dad anyway and somehow be shocked at his reaction.

I am in the closet to everyone except a few close friends who are also LGBT and are completely supportive. I have became so depressed living here in very bad living conditions regardless of my sexuality. I am at the point where I just want to tell my parents regardless of the consequences (whether I get beaten or disowned or most likely both by my dad). I have always been depressed but it has gotten worse lately. My grades have been slipping even though I've always gotten straight As and I can't find the motivation to pay attention in class or do any work at all.

Is it worth it to come out and get kicked out? I have a friend who is more than willing to take me in until I'm in a place where I can move out. My main worry is that my parents won't allow it and my dad will keep me home and try to beat the gay out of me. I just hate living here so much and I don't know if I can do it any longer. I've been craving the day I can leave for as long as I remember. I'm sorry if this isn't the place to post this, but I'm not sure what to do. I appreciate any advice you guys can give.

tl;dr: I'm gay and I can't stand living with my parents anymore. I want out but I'm not sure if it's an option. How do I tell my parents/should I at this moment?"
65,"Fiancé got super mad at me for something that wasn’t my fault and yelled at me. Has been happening other times.


My fiancé [M30] and I [F24] live with his mom right now because were saving up to move to our own place. Everything is going well and I couldn’t be more in love with him. 

Sometimes he gets mad at me because I don’t perform as well as he does in stuff and won’t let me help him such as cooking when he is making dinner and I want to help or make it myself.

Last night I didn’t realize the bathroom was clogged and It started leaking everywhere. I called for him and felt so anxious because I didn’t know what to do since this is not my house and I don’t know where everything is. I didn’t expect him to clean after myself at all.

He started cleaning very angrily and I told him I wanted to help him at least (I wanted to clean it all myself) and he just yelled at me and told me to go to sleep. I stayed there to help him clean, it was just a bunch of water, and he told me that I was just staring at him and it would be better to just go to our room. 

He was so mad, I felt so embarrassed that he wouldn’t let me help because he never does. 

After he finished cleaning he went to our room and I couldn’t take it, I started crying.

He hugged me and asked me what was going on and I explained to him how bad I felt that he yelled at me and he never lets me help or do anything on my own and that makes me feel dumb and especially that he gets so mad about things.

He said he was sorry and told me he loved me but I couldn’t stop crying. He also said he didn’t want me to get dirty and he was already dirty + I had had a long day at work... 

I love this man more than anything but that hurts me so bad and I told him a bunch of times. He fell asleep after a while and I simply couldn’t do it, I was on my phone and crying because I feel so hurt by my fiancé.

tl;dr: fiancé never lets me help with anything around the house or fix stuff. Last night there was an accident with the bathroom and he kept yelling at me to go away, he apologized and said he didn’t want me to get dirty because I had a long day but it happens all the time. "
66,"Is he just a cheater or is it something more serious?


I just had the worst breakup ever. I F[27] had been with my boyfriend [M31] for 4 years. He had to go away on business for a few months. From like April- early July. While he was away I pretty much took care of his mother and step father. They’re older and live with him. And his stepfather has a TERRIBLE memory. He may ask you a question he just asked you about 10 minutes later. Anyways I helped them fly home to Costa Rica, Bonded with his son and helped them speak on the phone with him while he was out of town. 
When he came home, everything changed. Everyone started to be cold to me. It was like, I wasn’t really welcome in his home anymore. I’d be there everyday but he like didn’t want his parents to even know I was there. It was so bizarre.
As months passed we argued like a lot about everything. I felt myself being shut out and pushed away. There was nothing I could do. I was kind to everyone. I did everything I could to make him happy but still it was like I wasn’t welcome.
One day I noticed his son unfollowed me on Instagram. I know not a big deal for some but for me it just..... bothered me.  We had a big argument and he told me his life isn’t my business and he broke up with me. After he dumped me, I had a night out with my sister and some friends. He watched us all night on Snapchat so I was thinking “if he cares what I’m doing so much.... what’s his problem?” 
We didn’t speak. I didn’t try and reach out or anything. Around mid December we started back talking, being really friendly and hanging out a lot. He messaged me if I wanted to hang out at his home before he went to  his Dj gig. It was short notice and he lives like 45 minutes away and I wouldn’t have made it in time. So he told me he’d text me after but warned it’d be about 3am when he was done and he may be tired. Around 2:45 am he texted me that I could come by tomorrow because he was tired. (Understandable..... I guess 🙄). So the next day I didn’t hear anything from him. I texted him and asked him did he still want me to come over. He said he had an allergic reaction(down there) supposedly from soap he used. I called him later and he was yelling at me saying how he’s told me over and over he broke out down there from soap. Saying mean things like “you sound like a broken record” I asked him why he even invited me over and he said because he wanted me there but he has “too much sh** goin on. “That same night I saw him on his insta live. I had started to view his lives from my cousins account so he wouldn’t know I even watched. He was just sitting there alone  talking with his viewers but you could hear a family party happening in the background. He stayed on his live for hours. Which was bizarre. Because you’re not doing anything and not hanging out with anyone so....what was the issue? did he really not feel well? A week later I was viewing one of his lives and he answered a FaceTime on live. It was clearly a girl. And it was a brief conversation. He answered a viewers question saying she isn’t his girlfriend and that she’s a girl dating his friend. I didn’t buy it. I called him and he told me he’s not seeing her and that she is seeing his friend. He told me he doesn’t have a reason to lie to me because we aren’t together. Yeah whatever. A few days later. He’s on his live and someone calls and he tells them “oh you can just come in”..... 10 minutes later you hear a door open and a girls voice saying joyfully “hiiii” and then his female viewers started asking him is that his girlfriend..... she wasn’t on the camera she was sitting on the side. So she didn’t see the questions but he answered “no”. In a way where she wouldn’t know he just told everyone she isn’t his girlfriend. And then after being pressed he finally said “guys this could be a family member or anything, you guys are assuming  things”. He ended up saying her name and it was the same girl he just lied to me and told me was dating his friend. I told him that he did lie to me. And he acted macho as if he never lied to me and he made it seem like I was crazy for knowing her name (he told me earlier). I could hear her laughing in the background. And saying he should get a restraining order for me. He said “that’s my next step”. I wanted to save myself the time. Take my pain from betrayal and just stop. I hung up. Blocked him on everything. And he messaged me on WhatsApp (forgot to block him there cause I barely use it). He told me pretty much, I couldn’t ever visit with his parents knowing once he came home because his mother doesn’t like me. I told him she used me because if she didn’t like me, she didn’t have to accept all of my help. Or be nice to me and he only said that they didn’t use me and she was nice because I was nice to her. He said he doesn’t have a girlfriend. But is sleeping with someone else. When I asked who he said “someone”. I said so your mother will allow any girl to walk through her front door but I wasn’t allowed? And he said “yes because it’s you” and harshly told me “my mom doesn’t like you!”.
I went off on him and then he messaged me I Hope now you see why things are the way they are (in regards to me going off on him). I told him I really didn’t care anymore and he told me to grow up. That was the end. 
I was devastated and so confused. I’d never done anything to his family. The only thing I’ve done to him was stand up for myself. His mother treats him like he’s Gods gift and I just value myself just as much. I wouldn’t allow myself to be treated like i was less than or that he was too good for me. And I didn’t let him walk all over me. And didn’t drool over him like other girls. So if that’s so bad then I’m guilty but I think relationships should be equal. 
The first few days I ended up looking at that girl from his lives Facebook. I found out she is only 19!!!!.
I then noticed on his social media that he now treats her like a “fan”. I had even seen her on one of his lives drooling over him and he wasn’t giving her the attention he once was.... typical. he follows random girls everyday all day on social media.  I noticed his step dad still viewed my insta stories so I blocked him from my social media. If they hate me so much,  I need to keep up with what I’m doing.
So After days of No contact..... I find myself wondering.... did he have someone serious, is he just a player, or is it because his mother hates me. Was he ever looking for something serious? What’s that mean when he says he has too much going on? His social media doesn’t even show that he has a significant other.... just that he follows a lot of girls. I was and am still so confused because he’s always on his lives alone saying he’s single, only mentions his one kid and doesn’t appear to even have anyone he’ll admit to talking to. So it’s like what the heck is going on. I feel so hurt and betrayed by his family. I can’t help but wonder if his mother really hates me or if he made that up. I’ve stopped viewing his lives completely. But I still feel so lost. 

TL;DR My boyfriend started treating me bad saying because his family hates me..... is that a cop out ? "
67,"I [20/M] met a girl [20/F] on New Year's Eve and asked her out, pretty clueless on what's next


Morning guys

Basically, I was at a friend's house party during New Year's Eve and met this girl who I talked to a bit and even kissed when the clock hit 12, though it was mostly my drunk ass friend who told us to lol. Anyways, I got her Snap and my friends kept telling me to ask her out and such for like a good hour or so. Now, in my 20 years on this planet I've went on one or two dates, so I am pretty inexperienced when it comes to this.

So the day after, we talked a bit on Snapchat, and eventually I asked her if she was free this week and wanted to go out for a dinner, and to my surprise she said yes. But she's a busy person so she can't go out this week. So I'm like, that's fine, just let me know when you're free.

So my issue is that I wanna keep talking to her, but at the same time I don't wanna look desperate or be that annoying guy who spams her. I haven't snapped her since then, but I did send a sup? to her about an hour ago just to start a conversation. Feeling pretty lost and I trust the advice from strangers on Reddit ;D

TL;DR - Met a girl on NYE, asked her out, she said yes but can't because of busy schedule, wanna stay in touch with her but without looking desperate/annoying"

hey guys just looking for some advice on how to prevent the situation

my wife(26F) and i moved from Georgia to Texas and decided we wanted to get her sister out of a shit town and invited her to move into us into the dallas area with the conditions she go to school and get a job. i agreed no bills were to be paid as long as she was handling her shit.

my wife recently stumbled on her having a conversation on speaker and recorded it. she was offered to move into a house with unknown. all bills will be paid, but sometimes she has to dance and go on dates. in the conversation the female recruiting her said if she ever needed anything she just had to ask and its easy, ""He"" will take of everything. need a confidence boost go talk to your other roomies. yadadada just bullshit fluff words you would expect from any sketchy company/persons.

the problem was she seemed really interested since her desire is to be an IG model and i feel like this is really the lifestyle she wants to live. at the beginning of the conversation the girl recruiting said she was also found on instagram.


there is multiple references to a ""he"" and how he handles all issues and takes care of everything and you never have to worry. he also runs multiple businesses and rents out exotic cars out of ""american"" exotic rentals in miami. the recruiter made many attempts at pointing out he only lives off his many businesses and not only off of the ""girls""


we are looking at the best way to approach her about this. she is young, pretty and throwing logic out out the window to chase her goals.

SIDENOTE: we are waiting for her piece of shit car to sell, in the meantime she is driving my fathers truck(he died in may) and with me being responsible for insurance and anything that vehicle is involved with as long as it being a very important to me. i dont want it to be a situation where anything can even remotely be ruined.


sorry for the grammar im a technician by trade

78,"My husband (M29) and I (F28) can't resolve a fight about his friend drawing a penis on our wall!


I have always had pride in how well my husband and I communicate, but we are fighting about something we can't seem to agree on. His friends have been being increasingly disrespectful to the home he and I share (but I bought myself), with it coming to a peak when someone decided it was okay to spray paint a penis on my wall. Obviously, I'm not okay with that and found it very disrespectful! This group of friends are welcomed into our home twice a week, and it's really the only place they can hangout without having to go out and spend money. So I decided that if that's how they're going to treat the house, they can't come over. 

Now, I do like his friends, and want to build better relationships with them. So I dont want to kick them out forever, just a couple weeks so that the consequences of their actions can sink in. I told my husband that I want him to be clear that they are not welcome BECAUSE of how destructive they're being, not because I don't like them, and that they will be able to come back, as long as they knock it off. 

First of all, am I being fair here? 

Here's where we're getting stuck...

We spoke about this last week on the way to dinner plans, he seemed to agree with me and, though he debated it, in the end he agreed to not let anyone come over for a bit. He drops me off back home after dinner to go see his buddies elsewhere....AND AT THE END OF THE NIGHT BRINGS ONE OF HIS FRIENDS HOME TO HANG OUT SOME MORE!

I. Was. Livid.

He tried to justify it by saying that he already had plans to have this person over, but if that's true, it never came up while we were talking about not having anyone over for a while.

Again, we have great communication normally, and if he had said ""ok fair, but I already have these plans in place"", I would have compromised and let this person come, as long as no one else came over for a bit. 

I'm not his mother, and don't expect him to do something just because ""I said so"", but I do expect there to be conversation and compromises! I explained all this to him, and said that I normally take such pride in our communication, but I felt like this time he disregarded everything I said, and what is the point of communicating if he's not going to listen to what I'm saying.

 He agreed, apologized,....

AND THEN HAD EVERYONE OVER THREE DAYS LATER! Like nothing happened. 

He says his friends got the point and they're apologetic, and honestly I believe that, but he's the one not getting the point. 

I feel like he walked all over me and ignored me and it breaks my heart that someone I love and care about so much sees me as such a weak person and would treat me like that. He insists that he doesn't think of me that way, but actions speak louder than words. 

I feel like I've lost a battle, and that I no longer have any say about who can and cannot come into my home. I keep trying to talk about it more with him, because it doesn't feel resolved at all to me. But I perceive his body language as he thinks I'm being ridiculous and he's done talking about it. His fuse is getting shorter and shorter each time I bring it up, and then I get mad because I feel like he has no place being frustrated, and then we go round and round in circles until one of us gives up on the conversation. And I feel like everyone is probably going to show up at my house again for football this Sunday. 

I genuinely am open to any advice you guys have! If you have a different perspective for me, I'd love to hear that too! I am not open to ""leave him"", because again, I love him and generally we get along great. I was thinking finding someone who could be a mediator while we try to talk it out again, but I'm not sure who to turn to for that kind of help. Advice on that point would be appreciated as well. Sorry for the long post! But I already feel a little better from venting! Thank you! 

TLDR: My husband and I are disagreeing on one topic, and I need help feeling heard."
79,"My [22/F] Friend went on a Trip and now I Feel she has Reevaluated our Friendship [24/M]


I'll do my best to keep everything brief:

I recently moved to a new city around August and hardly know anybody. I quickly made friends with a girl around my age. We've had an odd relationship to put it lightly. She was rather flirtatious to me, but I've come to realize that may be in part of her personality, rather than overt flirting. Once we exchanged numbers in October we talked almost every single day, since, whether by text or by calling. She casually told me that she was married, but separated, early on into our relationship. I fell really hard for her, but understand that with her being married, me and her aren't going to work out, at least not in the short term. Her marriage is up in the air, currently. Feelings aside, I love her very much as a human being and as a friend and want the best for her. Personally, I think the husband is abusive both verbally and (semi)physically. Objectively I don't think she should be in the marriage because of this, but regardless, nothing has ever happened between she and I, other than daily communication, which I've always found flirtatious.

Currently, she is on a trip abroad and has been for several weeks. Despite being away, she still kept up regular communication, albeit brief communication. I'd regularly get updates via pictures or short messages at least several times a week. The last time I heard from her was on Christmas, when we had one of our longer conversations since she left. There was nothing amiss about our talk, and I figured I'd hear from her soon after.

I waited several days and sent a ""Hey, how's the trip"" message which remained unopened until yesterday, but with no response. Suddenly, she's gone from ""I miss you and look forward to getting dinner when I'm back,"" to cold-turkey no communication. The whole affair is out of character for her. She once told me that there was a slight chance her husband may make an appearance on the trip, as he is wealthy and his job would likely pay for an easy overseas weekend. I fear that maybe she has rethought our relationship and friendship; however, since me and her have been out of communication, I don't know if he ever even came.

Regardless of my romantic feelings, I'm not sure what to think of the situation and I hate to lose someone who I think of very dearly. She shares something on FaceBook nearly everyday, so I don't think its an internet issue. I feel that either A) I'm crazy, which is quite possible; or B) what I described above. I'm just looking to hear some other opinions. I'm not too sure what to do, moving forward, whether I should reach out again, or keep waiting on her.

Tl;dr: A friend went on a trip and stopped communicating with me, as I believe she may have decided we should not continue being friends. I tried to initiate a conversation a week ago, but the message went unopened for a long time. I'm not sure how to proceed.

Some background.. I grew up in a home where alcohol, smoking, and e cigs were simply ignored. Me and my brothers were never told they were terrible, we just weren’t interested.

My problem now is I don’t really have friends because being around people who do those things (especially illegally because most my peers are 16-17) makes me uncomfortable. I feel lonely at school, except for my boyfriend keeps me company. But he is graduating this year and I won’t have anyone next year. I want friends, but I’m finding out that girls my age are either extremely annoying and petty, or nice and fun but druggies??

So now I am in a stage of highschool where everyone is experimenting with drugs and e cigs and partying. I honestly just don’t get it? What’s so appealing about it? I have a few people I like to spend time with during a few classes but they all do drugs and use juuls. I feel like I shouldn’t care because it isn’t my body, but I can’t help that I feel uncomfortable, right? Am I being too uptight or goody-goody?

Work is even worse. EVERYONE there parties, does drugs/uses e cigs. I feel so left out. Some people got pissed when I was against them advocating for an ex employee selling drugs to ‘get by’. Now those co workers act awkward around me and won’t talk to me about anything.  Now I feel like I was just asking for it.

tl;dr I want friends, but I am very against drugs, alcohol, and e cigs at my age... which is making that hard. Should I stick to my guns or lower my expectations and deal with it?"

87,"What to do about a crazy ex girlfriend?


  

I don’t know if this is the right sub for my issue, but hoping that someone has any experience in dealing with this. Apologies if this is long.

I’ve recently started seeing a new guy and we both really like each other. We are both 25. His ex is early twenties. 

From what I know he was with this girl for around 6 months. He broke it off with her following months of crazy/ possessive behaviour. 

I have known him for around 8 years at this point, but we haven’t been in contact for a few years. Not too long after they split, he and I met up for a catch-up, which has now progressed into serious feelings for each other and we are also sleeping together. I’ve met his parents, and he has met my siblings, and we are looking at this as a potential long-term thing. 

The only problem is his ex-girlfriend. When we are together, he can receive upward of 200 calls from her and 50+ messages (no exaggeration). This is every single day. They are mostly of her crying/ screaming or questioning his whereabouts or what he is doing. Most of the time he doesn’t answer and has to put his phone on aeroplane mode. She must be constantly trying to call him because as soon as he switches it back on the calls start coming through. I see his replies to her texts and they are all of him telling her to stop, that he wants nothing to do with her etc. Sometimes he is polite about it, other times he is extremely blunt and rude. When I ask why he doesn’t just block her number, he says he has tried in the past and she just manages to contact him from other phones, and she also owes him a few hundred in cash and he is holding out for it. Recently she sent a picture of her attempting to self-harm, but it was obvious there was no actual damage to the skin. As a female I understand that sometimes we do get emotional and might call/text too many times when we’re hurting etc, but this is on another level to the point I think she may have mental health issues.

Their would-have-been 1-year anniversary just passed and that day she told him she was going to kill herself.  I think this was the last straw for him because he messaged a family member of hers about it and asked that they sort her out. Low and behold the calls and texts stopped for the rest of the night. They started up again the next day and he has now filed a police report for harassment. He told her this, but she doesn’t seem to care and has mentioned on multiple occasions she will ruin his life. 

Part of me was cynical and thought that he must love this attention, after all why wouldn’t you just block the numbers calling and why would it take 4 months of harassment to file a report with the police for a restraining order? I wondered why he even bothered to entertain her by answering the calls. His friends have all confirmed that he doesn’t like her anymore and his family hate her, so I know he isn’t looking to reconcile, but I cant help but wonder why you wouldn’t try harder to put a stop to it. Other than this issue we seem to get along great, we always have done. 

I’d like to be in a relationship with this guy, but the thought of this ex is really off-putting. I can only imagine what she will be like if we were to go public. At the moment she knows nothing of me, and I don’t believe he is going to tell her out of fear of her reaction. 

So my question to you lovely people of Reddit is – how do I deal with this? Should I contact her myself or wait for the police/him to sort this mess out? Am I just being incredibly naïve?

TL;DR – Potential relationship with new guy being soured by his crazy ex. What to do about it?"

Why does my boyfriend constantly look at porn on reddit? 

I understand the purpose of porn to masturbate. It’s fun, it helps get you there, and is pretty interesting to look at. But my bf will literally look at it any chance he gets. I also understand that everyone masturbates, and I don’t mind that he does. But what’s the point of looking at/watching porn if you aren’t going to masturbate? 

I’ve asked him multiple times why (he looks at porn if he isn’t/doesn’t want to masturbate) before and he says he “just likes to look at it”. 

Maybe I’m too close-minded to understand his simple explanation, I’m not sure. I’d just like help understanding why one would do this? Is this a some sort red flag or sign of a different issue? 

Also, not sure if relevant, but our sex life is pretty good. I wish it was a bit more frequent, but we average about 3-5 times per week.  

Thanks in advance for any replies, responses, etc. 

TLDR: My boyfriend constantly looks at porn, even without the intention of masturbating. Why?

89,"Deal with missing girlfriend when travelling?


Hi there :) As a brief introduction, I am a college student (age 21) in a 4 month relationship with another student (age 24). In general I don't usually care about texting, but since I left to my dad's home country 20 days ago I have been missing her a lot. Back in school I basically lived in her place these 4 months, so I saw her almost everyday, but this winter break we haven't been able to talk a lot because of the time difference (5 hours more here than there) and because her family was visiting her. Now she is going to her home country were she will mostly be travelling, seeing her friends and spending time with her other side of the family. I don't want to be intrussive or needy, but I don't want her to get bored or that the relationship erodes. I will not see her until January 24. How can I better deal with this?

tl;dr how to avoid being needy when physically separated by 40 days from my gf"
90,"Man [60s m] i met in a dogpark is accusing me [35m] on facebook


Hello Reddit

Last month i was walking my dog, a golden retriever, in a dogpark and we met a man with a smaller dog. My dog is young and playful and went to greet the other dog and wanted to play. The other dog however got aggressive, snarling and barking at my dog. The smaller dog rolled around and under my dog and started to scratch, while my dog stood still. The man started yelling that my dog attacked his. I tought this was crazy and my dog and I quickly left. 

Later, he posted on the dog parks facebook, wanting information, asking about others who had been there. Today he messaged me asking is i was the person who had a dog who ""went crazy"" on his dog. 

What should i reply? This person has a much different view about what happened than i do...

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR: Dog owner is accusing me of having a crazy dog, when in fact it's his that is the crazy one. "
91,"I feel very guilty because my parents are mad/ hurted that I didn’t came home for the holiday


Hello, I am 20 years old. I study far away from my town and my parents (5 hours away). I’m in third year. During my first year of studies I couldn’t come home often (4-5 times in total). During my second I came back home at least once per month, sometimes twice. 

This year I’m studying abroad so I can’t go home oftenly. This holidays I went to Africa to see my family ( cousins, grandparents) for 10 days. My parents decided that me, my mother and my sister were going to Africa 4 days before we went so we were short on time. I told them that I didn’t want to go so I’ll be able to go to my town to rest bc after I was going somewhere else for NYE. They didn’t say anything about it. We went to Africa and we spent great holidays. 

But now my parents are mad, especially my mother. She called me and told me that I’m not the girl she raised and that I’m really an awful person. While I wanted to see with her a flight to go back home two- three days but she didn’t even let me talk and after that I was upset so I didn’t say anything by text or sth. 
Yesterday she texted me that from now she doesn’t count on me anymore. 
After that my sister told me that both of my parents talk about me like “she doesn’t want to come home anymore bla-bla-bla” but my father didn’t tell me anything. 

I’m really really sad that they are that mad at me but I told them before and they didn’t say anything about it I’m a little bit depressed now bc I really love them. But I’m 20 I want to visit some countries, to travel, that’s why I didn’t went. 

Tl;dr : my parents are mad at me bc I didn’t went home during holidays although I told them that if i go in Africa (like they wanted me to ) see our family I couldn’t come home after that. Rn they are super mad and my mother super upsetting with me"
