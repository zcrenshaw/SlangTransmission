0,"[UPDATE] My (28F) colleague (30F) didn't invite me to her wedding, and it's completely unravelled our friendship


[Original post](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/bctq5b/my_28f_colleague_30f_didnt_invite_me_to_her/)  


So it took me a few days to decide the best way to approach this, but yesterday I had lunch with her again and had the conversation. 

I started by saying: ""So you've sent all your invitations out now, haven't you?""

She looked immediately panicked by my question and I knew right away that she didn't want me to go down this road. 

When she said she had sent them all, I asked if that meant she could show me her venue now. 

She showed me the website of it, including the photo gallery, and talked me through all about where everything was going to happen, all the flowers and decorations she was going to add etc. It's a nice enough country hotel with some pretty gardens, but I'm not sure what all the secrecy was for. 

I probed a little more, asking who she's invited from work (the list didn't include me), said I was looking forward to seeing the photos so I could see how everything looked (she didn't correct me that I would see it on the day) and then I was completely sure that my lack of invitation wasn't an accident. She looked so relieved when I switched subject and asked if she's excited about her honeymoon and having a rest from all the wedding stress. 

So I'm definitely not invited. I thought it over carefully and I have decided not to ask why, for three reasons:

1) The reason is already fairly obvious. She clearly doesn't think we're anything more than colleagues and I've misread the situation. (There were some other theories suggested e.g. jealous husband-to-be, associating me with her past grief, but considering everything I know about her and our history I'm sure it's not that.) I'm not sure why she didn't cool it on the wedding talk with someone she had no intention of inviting, or even just bring it up with me and explain why I'm not invited, but never mind.  
2) Having an awkward relationship at work is the last thing I want. I'm worried that if I push this and turn it into an ""issue"" that I'll look pathetic and needy, or it will just be unprofessional. I also run the risk of her badmouthing me to colleagues and mutual friends, and I will find it much easier and less messy to handle my own feelings quietly.   
3) This is a once in a lifetime experience for her, and I don't want to be the source of drama that dampens her spirits at all. I'd rather just let her enjoy her wedding, make good memories and not bring her down. 

And you know, I'm fine with not going. It was never really about getting invited to a wedding, it was more having to face the fact that I'd been naive and taken for granted, and I felt silly that I'd invested way too much in this relationship. That's not all on her, because she was never obligated to be my friend.

Talking it through on my previous post actually really helped me work through my feelings. When I went back to work on Monday I felt much calmer and more detached from it emotionally. 

I have looked back on our whole relationship and honestly she's always been self involved, entitled and narcissistic. Being a bride has just made it more obvious, but it's always been there. She's also never given back to me (besides helping me get my job, which of course I'm grateful for), in that she's never been willing to talk me through any problems I've had, and although I help her happily with her work, she says no if I ask her for help in return.

She has a few office enemies and even though I saw her negative traits that caused her to be disliked by some people, I overlooked them and defended her anyway. Now I have put a little distance there it's quite apparent that she's not a very nice person, and I'm genuinely OK with just moving on.

She hasn't really noticed the distance between us so far (or she has noticed and doesn't care/is relieved that I'm giving her space), so I intend to just continue with doing that. If she eventually asks why, or I get the sense that she's trying to rekindle our friendship, then it will be time to clear the air with how I've been feeling. If she doesn't and we just continue drifting, then that's probably for the best.

It's sad to lose a friend, and it will probably take me some time to get over it and to become comfortable with the change in our relationship, but I have other genuine friendships, and plenty of colleagues who are lovely people who I can get to know better now.

The main thing I really took from my original post, and I'm so glad I did post because I needed some tough love on this, is that my fear of confrontation really needs dealing with. 

If I can learn how to better speak my mind as things are happening, that will stop things from building and building until I have to have a Serious Conversation and it makes what should have been a molehill into a mountain. 

I also need to figure out how to have difficult conversations without having an anxiety attack, which not only weakens my message but is extremely distressing and puts me off dealing with things and being honest with people. 

I had a couple of books on assertiveness recommended to me, so I've bought them to start me off. I'm also looking into going to a coach, or maybe a couple of therapy sessions at least, to try and better myself. I don't want to hurt other people by doing this, so this has become top priority for me. 

Thank you so much everyone who pointed that out to me. I was aware of it but I didn't think it was a problem and figured I'd just be that way all my life. Now I know better. Thank you for being so honest with me.

Also thank you to those who talked me through the one-sided friendship issue. I'm a good listener and have always attracted people who need to vent, but I only ever noticed the one-off conversations, and didn't think I was being taken advantage of as a long term listening ear.

I have been examining my other friendships in the last few days, to see if anyone else is using me in the same way, or if I've even been doing this to others and not had the self awareness to realise. There are a couple of changes I need to make, including a friendship that I need to set some boundaries in, and another one where I've not been giving back to the other person as much I should have. I have learned a really valuable lesson from this about maintaining healthy relationships, and I'm very grateful for that.

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR So I'm definitely not invited, our friendship is likely over (but that's actually OK) and I'm going to work on my assertiveness so I can handle things like this better next time. I'm also going to move forward having learned a good lesson about friendships being two-way."
1,"[Update]I [30f] want to discuss moving in with boyfriend [34m] but we have a significant difference in income.


OP:  [https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/b820za/i\_30f\_want\_to\_discuss\_moving\_in\_with\_boyfriend/](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/b820za/i_30f_want_to_discuss_moving_in_with_boyfriend/) 

Thanks for all the advice, I ended up broaching the topic last week.

As mentioned in the first post both my boyfriend and I have been hinting around the topic but hadn't directly discussed it. I was still on the fence about bringing it up myself when my boyfriend made a comment about how he's excited for us to live together (one day). I just responded with, ""Well did you want to? My lease is up in July."" and he said that he did.

It was before work when it happened so we left it at that for the day and got together that evening to work out details. I expressed to him at that point that while I would love living with him that my concern was that I wouldn't be able to contribute equally and I didn't want him feeling taken advantage of. He in turn expressed that he'd never want to put me in a bad position financially and that we could easily figure out something that would be fair while still putting me in a better financial position. 

We ended up deciding we'd go with a lump sum monthly that I'll pay to him to cover all the costs, rather than splitting bills. The monthly amount he offered at first I actually upped because I didn't think he was being fair to himself, and it was still less than what I pay now. He seemed happy with that and it definitely works for me!

He keeps mentioning how excited he is to move in together, and came to my apartment last week to help me clean for photos to show it! We're deciding together what we'll keep out of my furniture vs. his, what we'll get rid of and what we're going to store. He's also mentioned a couple renovations he wants to get done around the condo so we're going to go together to pick stuff out and make it a summer project. :)

**TL;DR:** Boyfriend gave me an opening to ask about moving in so I seized it. All went well and we'll be moving in together in June!"
2,"My (28F) colleague (30F) didn't invite me to her wedding, and it's completely unravelled our friendship


One of my work colleagues is a lifelong friend of mine. We lived on the same street growing up, went to the same school and when I needed a job after graduating university, she made me aware of an opening at the company she worked at. I applied, got the job, and it's been quite a few years since and we still work together. 

It's a pretty small company, and quite male-dominated, so after we started working together we became really close. We take all our lunches together, we regularly stop by each other's desks for a chat, and we quickly became known round the office as inseparable.

A year ago she got engaged to her long term partner, and I was ecstatic for her. She had a really tough time a couple of years ago (two family deaths close together) and I did everything I could to be a good friend to her while she was in the worst stages of grieving. She cried with me daily for weeks and I made sure she knew I was always available to listen. I also took about a third of her workload off her voluntarily, so she could take days off when she needed to without stressing about her work building up. So now that life has gotten better for her and she's always smiling and excited, it's really nice to see. 

Ever since she got engaged, as expected, she's talked a lot about wedding plans, especially at our lunches. I know basically every detail. When she booked her venue she was really excited, but she refused to tell me where it was going to be, saying that she wanted it to be a surprise when the invitations came out. 

The wedding is two weeks away now, and I've long since stopped waiting for my invitation to show up. I know when they were sent because she told me all about delivering them, and shows me every day the gifts people have started to buy off their registry. 

I feel silly for saying it, but the more I think about it, the more hurt I feel that I haven't been included. It's a big wedding, and she has invited some other people from work that I didn't know she was even close to. She hasn't mentioned the reason why I'm not invited, and at this point I feel too awkward to ask. I guess it's just a slap in the face because I really thought we were close, and now I'm realising that maybe we're not. 

The trouble is, since all this I've started to really examine our friendship, and I'm wondering if she even cares about me at all. I can think of a hundred examples of where I've helped her work through decisions, listen to her vent, stood up for her when she's had issues with colleagues etc. Even tons of little things, like if anyone brings in cake and she's out of the office I always save her a slice so she doesn't miss out. But I can't remember a time that she did anything for me in return.

Now when she talks to me, I've realised she doesn't even listen to me. When I'm finished talking she just carries on with what she was saying before, almost as if I'd never spoken at all. If we're ever talking about me or something I've been doing, she never has anything to say. She just kind of nods and then switches the conversation back to herself.

I'm starting to think she couldn't care less about me, she just likes having someone around who she can talk at, and whoever that person is doesn't really matter to her.

I've invested so many years into this friendship, it's really cut me deep. I feel used. It's also made being at work incredibly lonely, because she was my only friend. 

I've stopped having lunch with her and any time she tries to chat I politely bring the conversation to a quick end and go back to work. She doesn't appear to have even noticed.

I do still wish her well, I'm still glad for her that life has turned around and she's so happy, but I'm a bit lost. I'm not sure if I'm being too harsh because I'm hurt, or if I even have the right to feel hurt in the first place, as I know weddings have a finite number of guests and you have to leave people out that you would invite in an ideal world. 

But I'm not sure there's any way back from this either. Has anyone else had a similar experience? Am I being unreasonable or overdramatic? Should I just let the dust settle and see how I feel then?

TL;DR My best work friend didn't invite me to her wedding, and since then I've started to question our entire friendship. I think it's permanently damaged everything we had, and I'm feeling really hurt, lost, and unsure of how to proceed."
3,"Can I (19 m) tell my dad (60 m) to not attend my show, and perhaps tell security to not let him in?


I  am the product of an affair. My mom was 24 and my dad was 40, they’d met at some convention. My dad, was married with two sons 5&amp;7. I don’t know very many specifics, but my dad lived in another state and stayed with his family.

My mom and I were poor. We lived in a small apartment, and didn’t have a lot of stuff.  She did the best she could and even was able to put me through drum lessons. She had a sad kinda life. She was disabled and walked with crutches, she wanted to be a good guitarist but couldn’t move her hand good enough. She wasn’t in a ton of relationships. My dad would come see us, he’d sleep at our house. Now that I’m older I know what was going on and it infuriates me. She was in a PhD program for philosophy, and was just a good mom.

I was in fourth grade when she killed herself. I remember finding her more vividly than yesterday. When I had to go live with someone else, my dad and his wife came up and made me sell her records, my dad let me keep two. Then, when It was all said and done, they made me go live with my aunt so I “wouldn’t destroy their marriage.” 

I don’t see my dad much and am in his hometown playing with my band. Yesterday we went and recorded some interviews and he and his wife were there. The interviewer asked us what made us want to play music. I had a memory of my mom getting me bongos and us busking so we could go to a concert. After, we played and interviewed my dad comes up and says “ya know I gave her the money for you guys to see that show.” Okay, so? It’s important to who I am today. Can you not just let me have a fun memory?

We’re playing a show here tonight and he’s bringing his whole family. I feel uncomfortable having them there, and after his comment don’t want him near me. Am I okay to tell him I don’t want him there?

Tl;dr 19 year old drummer who doesn’t want his dad at a show because of comments he made about my deceased mom. Can I tell him not to come?"
4,"My (f 24) ex bf (m 27) is getting married to my sister (f 20). Our mum wants us to be civil and pretendi nothing happen in front of families and friends. What should I do?


TLDR at bottom. Throwaway account 

So about 4 years ago I started dating this guy that I met at university. We dated for 2 and a half years. We were getting along good or so I thought. About 2 years into the relationship I introduced him to my mum and my family. Mum liked him and my sister apparently did too (however I didn’t know that at the time). He had met my other family like uncle and aunties except as my friend. 

After that about 2 weeks later my ex bf and I along with my mum and sister tagged along with us to go shopping. My ex bf got along with my sister quite well. They were always talking and messaging each other. I became suspicious because in the middle of the night he would be smiling and laughing while we were cuddled up in bed together watching tv. He then got up to go to the kitchen to grab a cup of water. He was gone for 10mins so I decided to go and see what took him so long. 

Low and behold both my ex and my sister were being touchy feely. I asked what was going on and they both denied anything ever happen. But after a lot of exchang of words and screaming she finally admitted that she was in love with him and he was in love with her. 

They are due to get married in 6 months. I said I wanted nothing to do with the relationship. But my mum insist I go and support my sister and be happy for them in front of our friends and family who don’t know anything about my future brother in law and my relationships. Mum is thinking of disowning me and kicking me out. Now I am just mad and upset with my mum for taking my sisters side instead of mine. 

TLDR: sister is getting married to my ex. Mum wants us to be civil. I don’t want to go their wedding. Am I in the wrong for not wanting to attend their wedding."
5,"I (25F) found out my friend (25F) lied about her wedding being child-free just so I wouldn't attend


Throwaway since mutual friends use reddit. 


I’ve known the bride in this situation for around 7 years. We went to university together and lived together for 3 years, and were pretty good friends. We’ve lived at opposite ends of the country for the past few years, but kept in touch, and seen each other as much as possible. She met her boyfriend at uni, and they got engaged about a year and a half ago. In relation to the title subject, I have a one year old daughter with my husband.


6ish months ago Bride messaged me to say that they’d basically picked a date and location, but they were erring on having a child-free wedding, and wanted to warn me and my husband ahead of time to sort out arrangements, since we were both being invited. Our main issue at this time was that we wouldn't have anyone who could look after our daughter for the night, since the wedding was happening in Bride’s home town (combination of deceased, estranged and living abroad family means we can’t just let Grannie etc. babysit). I told Bride this, but assured her I’d get a firm answer before she sent out save the date cards the next month. 


Over the next couple of weeks my husband and I chatted about it, and ultimately decided that although we were both mutual friends of the bride and groom, I’d go to the wedding, and he and our daughter would stay in a hotel nearby and have their own little holiday. I passed all this information on to Bride, and got the reply ‘Great! Your save the date is in the post!’. I got the notice a few days later, and thought nothing more about it.


The wedding was last weekend. I’d arranged to travel to the venue with a couple of friends, who were at first surprised that I was attending, since Bride had said I might not be. I clarified that it was all sorted, and thought nothing of it. When we got there, the first sight we were greeted with were families of all ages, including children. One family had a pram with a baby who couldn't have been more than 3 months old. At first I thought that another wedding was just finishing or something, but when the stewards started calling for the guests to come forward everyone went in. Neither of the friends I had come with have children so didn't know about Bride’s child-free plan. The theory I settled on was that someone in the families had brow-beaten the couple into letting their children come, and it had spiralled, but Bride was trying to limit numbers so didn't challenge me planning to not bring my daughter.


Nothing else odd happened until the reception, when I was waiting to find my seat and Bride’s sister approached me, asking what I was doing there. I started again about the baby thing being sorted, but she pulled me aside. She said that Bride had literally been talking to her the day before about how I had never returned the RSVP that had been sent months before. I said I did, since Bride messaged to say she’d received it. The sister started to worry since Bride had apparently said loads of stuff about how I never made time for her and I hadn't spoken to her in months. I was shocked, and pulled out my phone showing messages sent the night before between us. Bride’s Sister is a good person, and judge of character, and said she’d sort it out, since she knew that there wasn't a place name for me and didn't want me to feel even more embarrassed - she came back minutes later saying that, in name, I was going to have to be the plus one of one of the groom’s cousins, since that was the only space free. Groom’s main family and I are actually from the same small town, so I didn't have a problem sitting and chatting with them. While we were sitting and waiting for the first course, I saw Bride and her sister talking at the top table, and pointing in my direction. Sister came over about five minutes later and pulled me aside - she said she'd told Bride that I was here but that I had never been told I shouldn't be, and Bride had apparently confessed that she'd told me about the wedding being child-free in the hope I couldn't come, then when I could she started to plant the seed of there apparently being a rift between us, thinking that Sister would tell me to stay away. I decided at that point to leave, since it was clear I wasn't wanted there at all, something that Sister agreed with. By the time I got back to the hotel (only a 20 minute drive) Bride had already blocked my number and our social media contacts.


I know there is probably no going back from this, but I just want to know why she kept up a lie for so long, only targeting me. There’s never been any animosity that I know about, and her husband and I have never had any issues over the years I’ve known him. No one seems to know what her reasoning has been for this (I don’t think anyone is hiding any real truth, many friends looked shocked when they heard Bride tell me she didn’t want me there). I wish I could know in myself what I could have done, but I don’t know how to broach the subject with her in the near future.



TL;DR - Friend warned me (mother of 1 year old) months in advance about her wedding being child-free; was able to attend wedding solo, only to find loads of kids and families were invited, and eventually told that Friend just used my baby an excuse to stop me from going. Hurt and confused, where do I go from here?"
6,"My BF (32 M) refuses to take a vacation with me GF (28 F) because I can invest the money on him.. Hence my questions, what's fair in a relationship? We have been dating for 5 close to 6 years.


Hi! I’ve been in a relationship for five (close to six years.) I am madly in love with the person I am dating. But I am having trouble with what’s fair in a relationship and where I should draw the line..

Backstory: I am 28, female, and currently working and make decent money for my age. I was able to buy my first home at the age of 28, I don’t own a car, no student loans (I was blessed with a full-ride scholarship), and was able to travel in my early 20’s..

My bf, male, 30, is currently unemployed, and has a massive student loan debt.. close to 150k, and going through some personal health scare right now..

I am currently giving him some money so he can keep afloat with bills. I also buy food, and his car insurance.

Recently, I want to take a vacation (and I invited bf) with me.. I said I am willing to pay for the vacation.. however, he says we can use that money for him.

So, what’s fair in this picture? I feel guilty for wanting to take a vacation because someone I care for is struggling and the other hand, I work hard to buy myself things..

I am having trouble finding the line of fairness in a relationship because my parents didn’t set the greatest example for me.. I know there are sacrifices made during a relationship, but what’s the boundaries?

Would it be unreasonable if I go on vacation on my own?

&amp;#x200B;

Thanks in advance and feel free to ask questions..

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

tl;dr: Bf doesn’t want me to go on vacation because money can be used on him. His reason: when someone is struggling financially, people don’t go on vacations."
7,"My (30 M) GF (30 F) is unsure if we should continue our 10 year relationship. How can I be proactive and save it without being pushy?


GF says she isn't happy and feels she needs to take responsibility for her own happiness. 

I want to work with the good things we have and put in the work to erase the bad things, which are mainly boredom perhaps and just the threat of everything becoming too mundane. 10 years is a long time.

Never really fight but things may have gotten a bit stale.

How can I show her how serious I am about working on my issues and our issues and that we have a future? Don't want to force it and for her to feel like I'm pushy.

TLDR: Stale relationship of 10 years - want to be proactive and show how serious I am about it working."
8,"[UPDATE] My [F26] sister [F23] keeps posting personal details of our relationship on her public blog/twitter. She doesn’t seem to understand why I don’t like this, and I am at my wits end.


Figured I'd give an update to this situation as it's almost been 2 years since the original post. Link below:

 [https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/6f7yz5/my\_f26\_sister\_f23\_keeps\_posting\_personal\_details/](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/6f7yz5/my_f26_sister_f23_keeps_posting_personal_details/)  

&amp;#x200B;

After reading through everyone's responses and taking for myself to see how I really felt about the whole situation, I did as I said I was going to do, and blocked my sister on all forms of social. I also cut her out of my life (albeit, temporarily). For about 8 months, I didn't speak to her, nor make any attempts at communicating with her.  That summer (so about 2 months after I had stopped contact with her), my sister moved away for school. My mother eventually got wind of the situation from my brother (who was 24 at the time and has never been particularly close with our younger sister) and asked me why I wasn't talking to my sister. 

Initially she was judgmental, but after explaining to her my sisters repeated behavior of posting personal details about me online (including my phone number and details about my sex life), my mother was furious and agreed that I had every right to cut her out of my life. At one point, my mother, during a phone conversation with my sister, called her out, calling my sister childish, petty, and vindictive and said that if she ever found out that she was posting any intimate details about ANY family members online like that again, she wouldn't hesitate to find a lawyer. She also threatened to kick my sister out of the house if she didn't stop her nonsense (while she was away at school, she did live at my mom's house during summer breaks/holidays).  I'm not sure if there was an actual legal repercussions my mom could have actually made against her, but it was enough to make my sister set her blog/twitter to private after my mom browbeat her into submission for being so shitty.  Due to this, my sister and my mom had a huge falling out as well, with my sister repeating the same old adage of how it was her ""personal"" blog/twitter so she could do whatever she wanted with it/on it.

Christmas rolled around and me and sister still weren't talking, and while my mom had patched things up with her to a degree, it was an awkward holiday. Me and my brother both live independently. When we went over to visit for holiday stuff, were civil and polite towards our sister, but we never failed to notice her on her phone 24/7. We could only speculate what she was doing, but I was less bothered now that she had set her blogs to private. Regardless, during a dinner at one point, she was on her phone and my mom asked her to put her phone down so we could have ""family"" time. She responded along the lines of ""yeah, one minute"", and my brother made a jab about how she was probably too busy posting ""bullshit lies"" about us on the internet. I should mention that while my sister doesn't seem to care what I think/ask of her, she has always seemed to respond and care about what my brother thinks. She tried to fight him on his comment for a minute, but he shut her down, calling her ""a fucking child"" who just wants ""internet points"" and straight up said that if she was "" a decent fucking human being"" she would talk to us about her problems instead of cowering behind a screen.  She shut up after that and retreated to her room after dinner was done. 

After Christmas, I continued to have zero contact with her. I would hear about how she was doing in school via our mom from time to time, but still had her blocked on all social media. She came home for the summer to work, and that summer our Grandma (my deceased father's mother ) died. My sister ended up having a complete breakdown due to the culminating and unworked through grief surrounding our father (who had died 2 years previous) and now our Grandma. She started going to therapy and actually taking her medication. 

Eventually, she reached out and apologized to me about her behavior the past few years. We had a sit down that fall, over some beers and talked about everything that had happened and her behavior. I told her while I accepted her apology, it would take some time for me to work through her how behavior had affected me and our relationship. I unblocked her on FB so we could make a group chat with our brother as a buffer. We now occasionally talk, but we still aren't as close as we used to be when we were younger. I actually went to lunch with her the last time she was in town and it felt...okay. So that's it, here we are. 

&amp;#x200B;

**TL;DR:** 

Blocked my sister on all forms of social media and cut contact, only participating in it during holiday events/funerals. Brother and mother supported my decision and made it clear to her they didn't stand for her behavior. Sister ended up going to therapy and actually taking her medication and later apologized. We occasionally talk now, but we aren't close anymore."
9,"My (m21) parents treat me like a slave and I’m so goddamn sick of it


Its always been like this. My parents are the type that go out and work, and keep that as their only concern. My siblings and I have always maintained the house, cooked for ourselves and done everything on our own, as well as for our parents. And sure, im partly grateful for it. As a result im very self-sufficient, can take care of myself and others very well, and can cook. All things I pride myself in being able to do, because I know a lot of other dudes my age cant. 

But things have gotten completely out of hand as the years have gone by. I’ve been taking a break from my main college for a year and half due to a stint with depression, and have instead been commuting to my community college for the time being. Im the youngest sibling, so at this point its just me and my parents living here.

I have a job, and even though im only part time, i still get about 35 hours a week on average, a few hours shy of full time. I go to school. Some days things line up where I leave home at 7:30am and dont get back until 11:00 at night, because i go to school first and then straight to work.

We have 5 dogs (2 dobermans, a dachsund, a bichon, and a pomeranian) and a cat. Im the sole caretaker of all of them. I buy their food, i train them, and I keep them and their living areas clean. Since im the only one that takes care of the pets, im the only one the pets respect and listen to, so when im not home and my parents are with them, they dont listen and my parents decide to put them in their crates. Then the dogs poop/pee in the crates in protest (or perhaps from lack of adequate walks) and bam, a mess for me to clean up when i get home.

Im the only person that does the dishes in the house and cleans the kitchen as a whole. Im the only one that sweeps the floors, cleans the bathrooms, vacuums carpets, does yardwork, everything.

I cook us all breakfast, lunch, and dinner whenever im actually home and able to cook. Neither parent ever cooks, ever. My mom barely knows whats in the fridge. I buy groceries with my own money. Its literally only me.

I dont care about doing my own laundry, of course I wash my own clothes. But my mom makes me wash hers too. My Dad does his own though, which I appreciate.

What truly irritates me about this all is not the fact that i do all this stuff. Im used to busting my ass day in and day out, its been my life since i was a kid. Its just that my parents just chill on the couch when i do it, they rarely ever say thank you for anything... and sometimes they just yell at me for shit that makes no sense. I literally just got in trouble because i’ve let cobwebs form in our basement. 

Whenever I try to talk to them, respectfully, about how stressed and overworked I am and such, they either tell me “thats life” or they get angry at me for being “ungrateful” and “lazy”. The irony is crippling. 

Im 21, I crave freedom so much right now, and here I am stuck in this house fulfilling the roles of a housewife and a family man while still going to college, finding time to study, and working. I came home to help re-center myself and mentally recuperate and while im definitely happier with myself, im definitely a lot angrier of a person than I was before coming home. Plus my (ex)girlfriend of ~3 years broke up with me a month ago, so i’ve definitely been a lot more emotional than normal lately what with the heartbreak and such.

I go back to my regular university in August, so its almost over. But i feel like im at my limit now with how frustrated i am on a daily basis.

TL:DR My parents literally treat me like a maid and its driving me crazy"
10,"Husband (33M) said he doesn’t consider me (26F) part of his family.


My husband (32M) and I (26F) have been married just under a year, together for 2.5 years. 

We were walking around in a store, casually browsing for items when he mentions something about being excited to be a family one day. I asked him to clarify and he said he’s looking forward to being a family unit once we have kids together. I asked him if he considered me family right now even though we don’t have kids and he said no, I’m his wife but not his family. We will only be considered family once we have kids together. I got offended at that because of course your wife is your family??? I thought that was just a basic thing that was understood. 

He apologized and tried to clarify what he meant, but I’m still not quite sure what he means. He says he love me a lot and I’m his whole life and he didn’t mean to hurt me. Am I out of line for getting upset? Isn’t your spouse considered your family? I guess I find it upsetting because I one hundred percent consider him my immediate family. 

Anyone feel similarly to my husband and can explain their reasoning? We’ve long since made up and everything’s fine, just wondering about the logic behind this. I posed this to r/AITA but the post was removed and it was suggested I post here instead. Thanks! 

TL;DR: Husband implied I’m not his family because we don’t have kids together yet. Am I out of line for being upset?"
11,"My (19 f) boyfriend (26 m) didnt arrive for Easter dinner


tl;dr my boyfriend slept through his alarm to come to Easter dinner and my family is upset

I've (19 f) been with this guy (26 m) for a couple of months now and my mom has invited him over for Easter dinner. She even went all out and made him an full sized Easter basket. She's not a big fan of him but is trying for my sake, which is a big deal because I still live with her.

He and I both work third shift, and about three hours before the dinner he texts me that he is going to take a nap and is setting an alarm. It's now almost two hours after dinnertime and I still haven't heard from him.

My family is upset, and I'm a little bit peeved too, just somewhat more understanding. I'm not sure how to handle him nor my family in this situation."
12,"My boyfriend [23M] says he forgives me [20F] for cheating on him, but I didn’t cheat


Almost a year ago my boyfriend accused me of cheating and it was huge argument that caused us to break up. According to him someone told him that I had cheated on him etc. I have always denied it because I honestly never cheated on him or have thought of doing so. We ended up getting back together and didn’t really speak much about it unless it was brought up in an argument. We were talking on the phone today and it came up and he said something along the lines that he forgives me and still loves me and it made me angry because I DIDNT CHEAT! I kept saying that I didn’t cheat and he ended up hanging up because he had to go into work. I don’t know how to feel or react about it because I didn’t cheat but he still says I did and it just weird? Should I just stop bringing it up or  should I confront him? What should I even say?


TL;DR : My boyfriend thinks I cheated on him because someone told him I did, I’ve denied it multiple times. A year later he says he forgives me for cheating and still loves me. I never cheated but he’s set on saying I did and saying he forgives me. Should I just let it go, what should I do or say?"
13,"[UPDATE] Should I [32/M] report my upstairs neighbours [25ish F+M] to social services for what I hear through the ceiling?


 [https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/ba45pp/should\_i\_32m\_report\_my\_upstairs\_neighbours\_25ish/](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/ba45pp/should_i_32m_report_my_upstairs_neighbours_25ish/) 

**Summary of orginal post**: My upstairs neighbours left their children screaming unattended for hours on end after midnight and when the guy finally responded he would shout at the children that ""THAT'S ENOUGH  GOD DAMN IT"" I asked reddit wether I should rapport this to social services.   
So from being a bit of a google detective it turned out that the guy was 30+ something and the woman was 24. I ended up sending in the rapport based on the advice that I don't have to prove that abuse is going on, I only have to be concerned. From the psychology I know I feel that according to john bowlbys attachment theory, letting children at around the age of 2 scream unattended for so long and then shout at them could be damaging for their upbrining. As someone else that been to therapy for having attachment problems I thought the right thing to do was to make the rapport. 

Well, the story has a happy ending, the shouting has stopped. It happened around 3 times per week before, and now for the first time ever it has been almost two weeks without it, so I think that getting the call from social servicies made them aware how it sounded to the neighbours and hopefully the children will better off for it. 

**TLDR:** Made the rapport, the shouting stopped"
14,"Is it inappropriate to take a friend (22 m) who has a girlfriend (25 f) camping? (I am 22 f)



I have a new friend Alex who is in a long distance relationship with a girl. I've never met her because she's in another country, and also we haven't talked.

Alex and I have talked about relationship stuff before, starting when I've been conflicted about whether to talk about making things more serious with a guy I was seeing casually.

I asked him what it was like, doing something long term and exclusive, because I've never had that. And from everything he's said, he sounds super committed to his girlfriend. Very happy with her, values their relationship over anything casual he could potentially have with someone else. I can tell he cares a lot about her, and I think their relationship sounds super lovely.

I was talking to Alex another time about how I wish I had friends who were into camping, I love camping but more often than not, I go alone because I can't convince my friends to give it a try, or I have taken them camping and they didn't love it. And he said he wanted to go, and would absolutely come camping some weekend in the next couple weeks. 

I felt a little weird about that. Not because I think it wouldn't be fun, and not because I wanted. to make a move on him or worried he would on me. But just because that sounded like something that just... Isn't done. Going camping alone with a guy who was in a relationship.

I don't think I have the most usual view of what is or isn't appropriate in a relationship, I've had very little relationship experience and the one that I did have, my ex and I both agreed it was cool if we had 1 night stands with other people. I'm also bi and have a lot of queer friends so I don't really see male and female friends differently in my own head, but I recognize a lot of people outside my social circle do. And I've got way more friends in non traditional relationships, polyamorous stuff, open relationships, people who have threesomes, people who are single and cool with casual stuff... I don't have much experience having friendships with people in committed monogamous relationships.

So, I asked Alex if it would be weird or inappropriate, since he's in a relationship. And he said that it wouldn't be. I didn't ask him to elaborate though. I should have, I think.

I also asked if it would be better to try and get a group together, and he said that I should totally invite anyone I want, but it doesn't bother him either way if I manage to get a group together or not. And I honestly think it would be hard to get a group going, my other friends just don't care for camping.

I guess I'd like to go camping and just hang out and enjoy nature and have some drinks around a bonfire. But I know I'd feel bad if Alex's girlfriend felt insecure or upset about it. I don't know her personally, and on one hand I think it should be fine because he's obviously very in love and committed so I don't think he'd do something that would hurt her. And he said it wasn't an issue. But on the other hand, I'm worried because it goes against the social norms I hear a lot about. 

I'm just confused because I don't have a lot of experience with this stuff at all and I wanna just have fun without stepping on any toes or making anyone feel hurt. Can I have some input on whether to take my friend camping?

tldr - I am friends with a guy who is in a relationship. I don't know if it's appropriate to go camping with him."
15,"Sister-in-law (32F) tries to banish us (38M and 33F) from our own family


My brother-in-law ""Joe"" (38M, my wife's brother) married his second wife ""Candy"" (the aforementioned sister-in-law 32F) in 2016 after they were together since 2014. We first met her in 2014 as well when he introduced her as his girlfriend. I've known him since I began dating my wife in 2008. Joe and I have always gotten along well, and became good friends during and after his divorce from his first wife in 2012. 

Now that the relationship information is out of the way...

Joe had become depressed following his divorce and never really came out of it during a few romantic relationships that didn't work out for him. So when he finally emerged from his sadness and said it was because he was with Candy, we were delighted and absolutely thrilled to meet her. She was nice to us at first, but the facade quickly faded, and she made it clear she didn't like us. In fact, she's forbidden Joe to spend time with my wife and I by himself and he's so passive he agree, so Joe and I aren't even friends anymore. The only reason Candy has dealt with us at all was to put on a good show for my wife's parents (ages 65 to 70 or so).

Several times each year, the six of us (myself, my wife, Joe, Candy, and my wife's parents) spent time together, sometimes at each other's homes to celebrate some occasion such as someone's birthday or a holiday. We hosted an event at our home once in 2015, but Candy didn't let that go well. When we nicely asked her not to take food into a certain area of our home, she insisted it would be fine and then essentially threw her food around the room. She didn't apologize and walked away without offering to help with the mess, then told my wife's parents she ""accidentally spilled"" it and we were ""just so nice to say it was fine and clean it up for me."" When my wife told her parents what actually happened, they didn't believe my wife. ""She wouldn't do that"". Oh, but she did. 

So after that we said we couldn't host anymore. Most of the time we would go to dinner at a local restaurant.  A pattern soon emerged.

Every single time we went to dinner, Candy selected the restaurant, the table to eat at, where everyone would sit at the table, and often what everyone would be having to eat and drink. Most times we didn't care so we just did whatever she wanted.

Then my wife suggested going to a restaurant she liked for her birthday in 2016, but Candy had already made reservations of her own and my wife's parents insisted we honor that. OK, fine. When we arrive at the restaurant, my wife and I sit across from my wife's parents because my wife wanted to be able to talk with them on her birthday. Candy insisted we move to allow her and Joe to sit across from my wife's parents. We don't really want to do so but we move seats because we know it won't end well if we don't. Candy proceeds to dominate the conversation and my wife doesn't even get to visit with her parents at her own birthday dinner. If either of us tried to talk to my wife's parents, Candy would interrupt and shift the discussion back to whatever she wanted to talk about. It was like the two of us were out to dinner by ourselves and seated nearby the four of them rather than all six of us together.

The same pattern continued for every event we went to as a family.  Candy picks everything, dominates the conversation, and that's just the way it was.

In 2017 my wife's birthday rolls around and she decided she really wanted to go to a particular Italian restaurant. Her parents agreed, and everything was fine...until Candy decided we were all going to eat at a Mexican restaurant instead.  So we meet up at my wife's parents place and my wife tells everyone she'd really like to go to this Italian restaurant on her birthday.

Candy was not OK with this. She insisted my wife could find something on the Mexican restaurant menu to eat. We don't have any problem with Mexican food in particular - we actually enjoy having it sometimes.  When we explained it wasn't about the food but about the fact that we wanted to pick the restaurant, Candy refused to accept this and then insisted we eat at a third entirely different restaurant ""since you don't like Mexican food"". We tried again to say where we wanted to eat, but by this point my wife's parents agreed to Candy's new restaurant and so that's where we went. 

So my wife decides to try something new in 2018. She tells her parents more than six months ahead of time that she wants to eat at the Italian place for her birthday BECAUSE it's her birthday and she'd like to have one birthday dinner at a place she selects. She points out that Candy literally always gets to pick the restaurant and her parents agree with that and so THEY tell Candy this time my wife is picking the Italian place and that's where we are going to eat. 

Since Candy feels to need to impress my wife's parents, a minor miracle happens, and Candy finally agrees to the Italian restaurant! So we all decide to meet at the restaurant at a certain time on a certain day.

Yet as we later learned, Candy decided that she and Joe would arrive a full hour before the scheduled dinner time ""to make sure we can get a table since they don't take reservations"". Keep in mind, no one had asked her to do this, and the restaurant had plenty of empty tables even when we got there. If it hadn't, we'd have been fine to wait. 

Candy also told my wife's parents to arrive a half an hour early ""to make sure they would get there on time"", but no one informed us of these changes. So for almost a full  half an hour before we arrived, Candy had already set everyone else up in the traditional seating arrangement and was buying them drinks and appetizers.

My wife wanted to let it go, but I decided to ask Candy and Joe to move, the same thing Candy had asked of us two years before and we just did it even though we really didn't want to do it. So I make my ask.

The conversation went like this (maybe not word for word but close):

\&gt;Me: Hey guys, we always sit the same way every time we go out to dinner. Since it's (my wife's) birthday, could we switch it up and maybe Joe and Candy could move over here and we could sit across from (wife's parents) so she can talk with them easier?""

\&gt;Candy: We're already sitting here. We'll do that next time, mmmkay?

\&gt;Me: Could we please do it this time? This is her birthday dinner, after all.

\&gt;Candy: Oh my gosh, it doesn't matter!

\&gt;Me: OK, well if it doesn't matter to you, then could you move please? It would mean a lot to us.

\&gt;Candy: (louder) It doesn't matter!

\&gt;Me: Well, if it doesn't matter, then why don't you move?

\&gt;Candy: Because you don't get to come in here and demand where we sit!

I know I could have been nicer, but I was getting frustrated. 

\&gt;Me: But you do, right? You get to demand where we eat and where we sit every single time we go out together. Most of the time we don't care, but the one time we ask, you still have to have your way.

\&gt;My Mother In Law: I'll move. Will that be OK?

\&gt;Me: If you want, you could move  to sit in front of (my wife) and then she can talk to you more easily, but we were really hoping Joe and Candy would move...

\&gt;Joe: I'll move...

At this point Joe starts to get up and Candy literally grabs his leg and forces him to sit back down.

\&gt;Candy: (very loud) We're not moving! This is ridiculous! 

No one except Joe is even paying much attention to her at that point, though. My mother in law moves to sit in front of my wife, and I take my mother in law's former seat next to my father in law. Everyone is relatively calm except for Candy, who I can see is silently seething for a bit before leaving to go to the toilet. 

While Candy is gone my wife explains to everyone else that she didn't want this to be a big deal but she does appreciate that her mother moved. My wife's parents say they just want peace so that's why they like to let Candy decide things. We want peace too, my wife says, but that doesn't mean we should all constantly let Candy have her way and there's no need for her to refuse a simple request and be rude like that. Joe sits silently but everyone else agrees that none of us are sure why Candy couldn't have honored this one request in a peaceful way. 

Candy returns and the dinner goes as usual with the exception of the fact that for once my wife got to talk to her mother during dinner and Candy didn't dominate the entire conversation. It was a nice change - for everyone except Candy, which would soon become clear.

After dinner, my wife and I say we're going to the nearby store to get a few things and my wife's parents decide to go too. While we are in the store, my wife's mobile receives a text message from Candy. Among various insults for both my wife and I, the text says Candy and Joe will no longer be going to dinner with us and that we are forbidden by Candy from visiting with my wife's parents since we were so disrespectful to them.

Keep in mind we were with my wife's parents when the message came to my wife's mobile. My wife's parents were shocked and told us that they hadn't felt we were disrespectful to them at all and if anything Candy was wrong for sending such a text message. We didn't respond to it, and my wife's parents thought that was a good decision.

Candy's banishment didn't work and we have visited with my wife's parents. In fact, my mother in law wants us to work it out so we all ""get along"". 

When my mother in law asked if Candy would apologize so we can move beyond this because she wants it to work out, Candy told my mother in law the only way it can work out is if we apologize instead AND agree not to see my wife's parents anymore so that we can't disrespect them further. My mother in law has told Candy she didn't think we were disrespectful and that's not what she wants but Candy told her it's for the best. 

Candy's already kept Joe from spending time with us without her present, and now she wants us to never see my wife's parents.

So what I want to know is if anyone can help with this:

We don't want to agree to Candy's demand that we not visit my wife's parents, and even they don't want that - but Candy has indicated she won't relent.  My wife has decided she's simply going to ignore Candy and Joe, but my mother in law would like to see us all ""get along"".

Should I have never asked Candy and Joe to move and just let everything stay the way it was in the name of keeping the peace?

Is there anything can we possibly do here to solve this situation? 

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR - Sister in law insists on having her own way about almost everything when we are all together as a family. When she is asked nicely to do something different for my wife's benefit on my wife's birthday, she not only refuses but insists we should apologize  for even asking and also demands we agree not to ever see my wife's parents again."
16,"I (37F) am being aggressively pursued in friendship by someone (42F) I do not wish to be friends with.


Our daughters are friends and in the same elementary school class together. Earlier this year we had her daughter over to watch the Super Bowl with us, she was picked up by her mother and nothing seemed odd.

Last week the girl’s (I’ll call her Mom) texted me to ask if my daughter was available for a play date the following week. We were on vacation so I told her it would probably be fine, but I’d wait and see in case anything changed when we got back. It turned out it was fine and the day we got back I texted her back confirming the play date. She responded, “Great, I’ll make us lunch and the girls can play. You can bring your son, too. My older daughter is his age and I think they’d have fun.” Red flag #1. I don’t know about most of you, but ‘can your kid come over and play’ is different from, ‘let’s socialize as adults over a meal and force our other two kids who don’t know each other well to hang out.’ I decided I was being too socially awkward and what’s the worst that could happen- let’s do lunch. I’d ask my son about coming.


Mom laid it on thick. She said they had X and X toys he could play with, they would be so happy and she just knew they’d hit it off and have a blast. My son decided he’d like to come, after all it was better than staying home and getting bullied by his big brother and being bored. 


So we go. The kids go play outside on a gorgeous day. One of the first things she tells me is that some other mom she’s talking to doesn’t communicate with her as much as she likes and that so many other parents are on a different “speed” than she is. But not me. I am exactly her speed (whatever the fuck that means). Red flag #2. She’s so glad I’m there because adult female friendships are hard and people’s schedules are tough to coordinate, etc. which is true, but... this is 2019, lady. You don’t assume someone’s speed. I happen to be the very lowest speed that exists and you seem to be, I don’t know, higher? 


I notice she has decorated for Easter and that there are a lot of Christian decor items around. Which is okay, I don’t care, but tells me she’s someone I most likely won’t be best friends with. She serves lunch and she and her daughters sing a blessing song before they eat. My kids and I just sit awkwardly. Kids eat and leave to go play. 


Once it’s the two of us again, she starts talking about her mother and mother-in-law and possible mental illness. She starts out sort of cryptically, baiting me to ask questions to further the conversation. Whether or not she realizes it, she’s attempting to manipulate me at this point, but I could see what was happening. She is coming across as a victim of mental and emotional abuse from her family, suffers from depression and anxiety, yadda yadda, and she is fishing for support. I don’t disbelieve her and I don’t have anything else to talk about so I do the worst thing possible: relate. Oh yeah, my mom can be nasty too, I’ve struggled too, I am a woman too. 



She starts saying things like, I’m so glad you’re in my life, this was meant to be, you should join me at this mental health workshop, I’ll pick you up and we’ll go together. She is then going to pick me up and we’ll go walking around the lake together. She’s going to pick me up and take me to this special grocery store. We’re gonna go to the gym together. Final straw red flag.



I could see at this point that she had mistaken my commiserations as a rare bond between us. I began getting super vague and telling her I was busy going back to school, and we would be busy in the summer with swim team and traveling (to which she replied with her plans to meet us at the pool- damnit!). 



There were other things she said and did that were odd. Insisting her daughter wear a jacket outside despite it almost reaching 80. Completely overreacting when her deck umbrella almost tipped over. Saying her best friends were her husband and God (I really don’t mean to offend religious people, but that’s just not someone I can relate to) Telling me nobody else listens to her like I had. Telling me that she makes her family sleep in the basement during thunderstorms. 


When I came home she sent me several texts. About the workshop, some movie star she talked to once, her handyman’s phone number that I actually asked for. They all said things like I really loved having you here, and these are all exact quotes in the 3 different texts- I adore you,  all my love, hugs.  Seemed a little too intimate for someone I’d known less than. 24 hrs.



This morning she texted me at 8:30 to say she hoped my day was filled with joy and her kids already wanted mine to come back over.


 Okay, that’s all of it. I feel a bit lured and trapped. I do not want or need a friendship. But I also don’t want things to be weird between our daughters, ya know? I might be overreacting to the situation, but regardless, I really don’t want this woman in my life and I’m entitled to that, but she is taking advantage and making me an emotional hostage. I don’t know how to proceed. Advice is greatly appreciated. Thank you.


TL;DR:
A woman wants to be my friend and is, in my opinion, pursuing me too hot and heavy, possibly using manipulative techniques. I don’t want to be friends. I want to drop her like a hot potato, but our daughters are friends and I don’t want to jeopardize that."
17,"Work relationship - Me - Manager (50'sF), huge insubordination problem with Receptionist/Admin (60'sF)


 

I have 40 years of legal experience, first as a legal secretary and then a paralegal. Over 20 years with the same firm and as they grew I also morphed into also managing the office. Our last receptionist/admin had a health issue and had to leave immediately, so we hired a woman I will call Bea. I wasn't 100% thrilled with the hire, but went along with it because she could start immediately.

There are a lot of issues with Bea, and at first I thought maybe I could make this work with training but what I just discovered has me wanting to throw her out the door this second.

We have a client who is in prison (white collar crime). We are handling matters for him that he calls every week or so to discuss.

Bea answers the phone on her 3rd day here and the recording announces that we have a PREPAID call from an inmate at big prison, press 1 to accept blah blah. Rather than say ""Cat, it's a call from a prison, what do I do?"" or ""Cat, pick up line 1!"" she just hangs up the phone. The recording announces immediately that it is a PREPAID call so it's not like she had to decide to accept charges. Plus, she interrupts me all day long to see if I want to talk to every salesperson that calls and wants to sell us a new copier, office supplies, redo our website, whatever. There was absolutely no reason for her not to get my attention rather than just hanging up and then telling me that she just hung up on a call from a prison.

Because it was only her 3rd day and she gets overwhelmed so easily, I had not yet covered every possible scenario and did expect her to use some common sense. If you can interrupt me to ask if I want to talk to all kinds of salespeople all day long, surely you can manage to say ""Cat, pick up line 1!"" or ask me what to do. This is a law office. It is not a stretch to think that maybe some of our clients are incarcerated and maybe they will be contacting us and perhaps hanging up on them without asking is not the smartest thing to do. I was ""wtf Bea"" on the inside, but on the outside I said ""Bea, when you run into a situation where you don't know what to do or that hasn't been covered, just ask me or pass it on to me and I'll handle it and go over it with you afterwards. Sometimes we have a client that is incarcerated. Don't ever just hang up on a call like that, especially one that is prepaid, ok?.""

I was polite. She had a meltdown and literally yelled ""*You should have told me! It's your fault*"" I tried to diffuse the situation but she wouldn't let it go, insisting over and over how ""I should have told her"". Well, you supposedly have had decades of experience, launch into ""well at my last job..."" every time I try to show you how we do something, stomp off when I ask you to make corrections and have in general been difficult over the past 3 days every time I try to train you in our procedures and sorry I haven't covered every scenario in 3 days and expect you to exercise some common sense .... but I phrased it better than that, walked away and sent an e-mail to a member of the clients immediate family that I know very well and that he contacts every day that said ""*Can you tell X we have a new receptionist/admin and when he called here this morning she hung up on him before telling me. I just let her know to always take the call from him. Sorry for that! If he needs a check and can't make another call today, please just e-mail me what he needs and I'll have it ready for someone to pick up by 10:00 am tomorrow. Take care. Thanks again, Cat.*""

While looking through some emails a week later (yesterday), I discovered that Bea had seen my e-mail to the client's family member and then proceeded to send them an e-mail of her own minutes later, going on about the reason she hung up on X was because ""I didn't tell her"".

My mouth was hanging open. I made it clear to her the issue was closed and when you don't know something, ask. She does not have free rein to contact clients of the firm and say whatever the hell she wants to them. And to contradict me on her 3rd day, or any other day for that matter, in an unauthorized e-mail??? Who does she think she is to send something like that out? What the hell is wrong with her?

Should I insist she be fired today?

She has a shitty attitude and I don't want her here another minute. My boss agrees about the attitude but feels we need someone at the front and that she is better than no one for now and that we can tough it out until we find out if our last employee will be able to return or not. A temp is out of the question, not my call and decision won't change.

**TLDR: Employee of 3 days sends unauthorized and inappropriate email to client after final discussion with me about incident.  Last straw.  I want her gone now.  Boss doesn't like her either but wants to keep her until we find out if old employee is coming back or not.  Should I go all out on this?**"

My boyfriend was upset at me last night because I didn’t cook dinner. Earlier yesterday we planned to go to the dispensary and grab some dinner. We ended up just grabbing some pot and we both agreed we weren’t hungry so it could wait.

Once we got home we started watching a movie and he said he wanted a snack so I grabbed some pastries from the kitchen. He only ate one I had no idea he meant he wanted me to cook the turkey burgers we mentioned earlier. 

Anyway throughout the night he kept basically throwing a tantrum. Sighing all night saying his stomach hurt. I asked him if it was because he was hungry and he confirmed it wasn’t that. 

Finally, I ask again because he’s clearly upset. All I’m asking here is for clear communication. He gets upset that I continued to ask. He tells me it’s too late to eat and that he doesn’t want to and that I’m an airhead for not knowing he wanted dinner. He also said I kept asking to make him feel bad so that I wouldn’t have to cook.  At this point I’m just confused. I told him I couldn’t read his mind and that he clearly needs to communicate better. 

Come this morning I wake up to him pouring water on my face and laughing about it. I was so angry because he didn’t want to talk last night like adults and was disrespectful to me and now I wake up to him pouring water on my face? That’s not funny to me. I’m not sure why he thought it would be funny? Maybe to try and get back at me for last night? Or maybe he truly thought it was funny but I was already in a bad mood about his tantrum the night before. 

He tried to hug me because I was angry and I kept trying to push him off. He decided to pack the few things he has at my house and said it wasn’t a good idea for him to stay here. His response to my disbelief was “we don’t get along” 

I just feel that anytime we have a disagreement he never  wants to talk like adults. He thinks I’m being dramatic when I’m trying to solve a problem like adults. 

I don’t know if I’m even doing relationships right anymore. Did I over react over this? I feel that anytime we get into a disagreement I start questioning whether I did something wrong and then try to apologize but I’m over apologizing and he never does. I just need some suggestions and advice here so that I don’t repeat this again. 

Thanks


TL;DR: My boyfriend got upset and took his belongings because I was angry about being woken up by having him pour water on my face."
19,"[UPDATE] I [25F] have had a huge fallout with my sister [24F], and my parents are now trying to get involved. Help!


Original post [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/bcca4h/i_25f_have_had_a_huge_fallout_with_my_sister_24f/)

TLDR: sister and I had a big fallout from her being a pain in the ass on holiday, she went straight to my parents, and now my Dad is also being a pain and expecting me to sort it all out, despite doing nothing wrong. Along with expecting family respect to be unconditional and that I should back family up no matter what(!)

\---

My dad eventually messaged asking if I had thought about going to see my sister this week with him, and suggested another weekend in a few weeks too. I said no to anything this week, and that it's my partner's birthday the other weekend.

Dad has now messaged asking if I could message my sister when I'm next in town, and that I should buy her a drink as ""there is a risk of money issues now being a problem between you both"". Also says ""I know you have always been generous in the past"", and ""I know I am asking a lot by suggesting that you get in touch ... but I feel we have made so much progress in the last few days - and this seems like a relatively easy way to break the ice and draw a line under this episode. Will you do that for me?""

After all your replies on my last post, I'm realising how biased and one-sided all of this is. I'm not sure why I'm the one who a) has to get in touch, and b) pay for drinks!! Given it's my sister who caused the issues in the first place. I feel like I'm being guilted into sorting this out and I'm very nearly at a point of falling out with my Dad. This has really pissed me off :("
20,"My (28F) wife’s (25F) family stopped talking to her after she said no to co-signing on a mortgage


Hi reddit! For starters, My (28F) wife (25F) and I are both in the military and we have no children currently—we are thinking of starting a family in the next two years. Being service members usually comes with a lot of benefits, including VA loans.

To backtrack a bit, i don’t have a relationship with my mother whatsoever. She’s a narcissist who only used me for my money and credit growing up and I’ve been no contact with her for about 2 years now. My wife and i are newlyweds, and she’s quite close to her mother and 5 sisters (her father passed several years ago). She is the second to youngest of the 6 sisters.

It’s quite intense a times, having to deal with so much female energy, and it always feels like they’re fighting each other. However, since their father passed, they stick together and try to help each other along as best they can—within reason of course.

A couple of months ago, my mother in law (51F) asked my wife if she would co-sign a mortgage so she wouldn’t lose a house she owns in California. My mother in law lives abroad and she only comes to the states once a year at most. Since my wife and I are married, this would mean we’d use OUR one chance at the VA loan by giving it to my mother in law. I was not comfortable with this from the very beginning. My mother stopped talking to me after I didn’t give her these very same benefits, and I wasn’t about to be a hypocrite and give it to her mother. 

This was my wife’s first time saying no, and her family did not take it lightly. They even blamed me for influencing in her decision. She tried to explain that we are a couple now and we’re trying to start our own family soon. We want children and we’ve worked very hard to secure our benefits, which I 100% believe we should enjoy. However, they believe that since she’s the younger sister, she has no right to deny them, much less provide reasoning for saying no—this is considered talking back and is disrespectful. Her mother basically played the victim and turned 3 of her elder daughters against my wife.

Anyway, the sisters all dog piled on top of her and gave her hell for being a disobedient child. 

A couple of weeks later, one of the other elder sisters reached out to her and basically asked for the same thing—To co-sign a VA loan on a house she wanted for her family. She said it was a different request than their mother because, “mommy is different, she’s unreasonable sometimes.” Again, my wife said no, and was in disbelief that she was going through this again.

At this point, the entire family has ignored her phone calls and attempts at reaching out to put out this fire. At first she felt very guilty for saying no, but after speaking with her therapist, she realized that she has a right to say no and not be attacked for it. I also understand the dynamics in large families. I myself am the eldest of 4 so I can relate to the expectations that we have for our younger siblings. I was able to recognize my mother’s narcissism though so I’m careful not to repeat the same mistakes with them. 

I feel so bad for my wife reddit, and I’m not sure what to do. Part of me feels guilty and thinks she should’ve said yes just to avoid this whole fight. But I also think we’ve worked so hard in the army and eaten a lot of shit, and we should be able to enjoy our lives after all of this is done. Should she reach out again? Should she take a step back and let it die down? She says she doesn’t care and they’re going to lose her, but i know she doesn’t really believe that. It’s killing her to be the scapegoat right now and it’s killing me to watch her suffering. :(

Tl;dr 
My (28F) wife’s (25F) family stopped talking to her after we refused to co-sign on a mortgage."
21,"My [22M] therapist told me yesterday that my girlfriend [22F] emotionally abuses me. I might be in denial.


Hello everyone,

So I'm a 22 year old male in his fourth and final year of university in the United States.  For the last few months I have been seeing a therapist about life anxiety with moving away from university as well as with anxieties pertaining to my relationship.  Yesterday was the first day I really told my therapist the extent of what goes on in my relationship and she warned me that I am in abusive relationship and that I should act accordingly.  This phrase was a complete bombshell to me as while I'm not super happy in my relationship and other people (including my mother) have accused my girlfriend of being over-controlling, I never really thought that I could be the victim of emotional abuse.  I'm a 6 foot male and my girlfriend is 5 foot, so I was somewhat embarrassed at the concept that I could be abused, but here we are.  I just want to list a few of the things that led to this ""abusive"" label to see if others agree that my situation is not healthy.

1.  My girlfriend controls my favorite sports teams.  I grew up a diehard Boston Red Sox fan and New England Patriots fan.  Ever since I've dated her, she will yell at me if I wear t-shirts of either of those teams, instead making me cheer for the LA Rams and the LA Dodgers, her favorite teams.  She will unfollow Boston sports figures on my social medial and force me to say that I hate my teams and the players on them and that I love her teams.  I realized this was ridiculous yesterday and confronted her and she said it was ""75% a joke"" but that she did it so that we'd have ""more in common.""
2. My girlfriend yells at me for talking too much to my family.  I try to talk to my family at least twenty minutes a day, and my girlfriend tries to get this not to happen.  She will mouth at me ""wrap it up"" when I'm on the phone with my family and tell me to have conversations out of earshot of her because she ""doesn't want to hear them,"" because she claims that they have not been welcoming to her.   
3. My girlfriend doesn't like me seeing my family.  I go to school a couple hours away from where I grew up and I'm very close to my family.  However, she will shame me into going home to my family saying that ""I see them I'll the time"" and that ""she can't sleep without me.""  Every time I go home, it's a big fight and she always claims that I'm choosing them over her.
4. My girlfriend verbally harasses my family.  She has referred to my mom as ""Hitler"" in her therapy sessions and has told me that she does so.  When I confronted her about this, saying it made me uncomfortable, she said she thought it would be ok because I joke around a lot.   The way she said it did not make it seem like a joke.  She also refers to my twin brother as ""her enemy.""
5. My girlfriend will not put up with any complaints that I have, legitimate or otherwise.  A few days ago I went to visit her, taking two subway trains and walking about half a mile through the rather dangerous neighborhood that she lives in to see her.  There were a couple times on the walk where cars did not stop for me in the intersection when I had the right of way, including one time where I very nearly was hit by a car.  When I told my girlfriend about this, she said I was ""lucky to have a crosswalk"" and that ""no one complains as much as I do.""
6. My girlfriend has said that if we ever kids they will never be able to see my mom because she wants them to have her own morals rather than my mom's morals.
7. My girlfriend claims that she always chooses me over her friends so I should do the same.  Whenever I have lunch with a friend that lasts a little too long, she will accuse me of doing something inappropriate.
8. My girlfriend will give me ultimatums in terms of having to do something or else she'll leave me.  For example, I'm taking a summer organic chemistry class this summer, and she's said that if I am not willing to take 3 days off in the middle to go to her sister's wedding in Montana, she will break up with me.

There are other behaviors that I'm not including here for the sake of keeping this post readable.  The thing is people always tell me that my girlfriend is controlling but I think I got used to it and never, ever considered the word ""abusive"" in relation to our relationship.  So I'm seeking outside opinions here on what I should do.  I'm graduating in three weeks and then moving on to a new city, while she's staying in the same area.  It seems like leaving her is what everyone is telling me to do, but I wanted to get a few more opinions.  Thanks so much!

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR: People, including my therapist, say my girlfriend is controlling and perhaps abusive.  Want to see what my next steps should be."
22,"I [26F] have always suffered from migraines, my boyfriend [28M] didn't believe me


My boyfriend, I'll call him Greg, and I have been together for about a year. I'll just cut to the case: I've suffered from migraines since I was a teenager. They're bad enough I've seen specialists about them and have prescription pain killers that I'm suppose to take when I feel one coming on. I know a lot of people say they get migraines that are really just bad headaches, but for me it's the real deal, vetted by a doctor and all.

Greg's feelings towards my condition are... Completed. He believes I *used* to suffer migraines, but don't anymore. He believes the ones I had as a teenager were real, otherwise I couldn't have gotten the disagosis or prescription, but that I grew out of it and don't get them anymore. He cites the fact that he's never seen me suffer one as proof of his theory. He's never seen me suffer one because I take my meds when I feel one coming and nip it in the bud. When ever I said I feel a migraine coming and reach for my meds, Greg sometimes asks if I really feel it or if it's in my head. My response has always been the same, he's not my doctor and although I love him and value his opinion on many topics, this is one thing that I feel he is unequipped to make a judgement call on. He's always nodded and (I thought) understood, but I could always tell he wasn't happy with my answer.

A couple weeks ago things kinda, I dunno, escalated? I'm still angry about it so bear that in mind while you read this. 

I'd been at Greg's place a few days, we both had the weekend off and we're spending it together. It started when I felt a migraine coming. Greg and I were cuddling at the time so I got up to take my meds. Greg tried to stop me, saying he didn't want to ruin the moment. I just said I'd be back and left. I went to my night bag where I kept my meds and they weren't there. I rummaged through it trying to find it but it just wasn't there. The pain in my head is getting worse, so I give up on trying to find the bottle and reach for my purse where I keep a smaller bottle for carrying around since I figured they would do for now.

That was gone too. By now I'm pretty distressed and the pain is getting worse so I'm emptying my bags on the floor. Greg comes in after a while and asks what's wrong. I tell him I can't find my meds and the need is getting worse and I know it showed in my face and voice. He sighed and said I look like a drug addict looking for a fix. He tries to take my hand but I don't let him and keep on looking. 

After a while of looking and not finding my meds my head starts really pounding. I give up and resign myself to waiting out the migraine. I turned off the light and went to bed hoping to sleep it off. Greg checked up on me occasionally, asked if I needed anything, I just told him I needed to sleep it off and be left alone. I never did end up sleeping, the pain for worse and I was getting nauseous. It was overwhelming and I dashed into bathroom to dry heave. Greg came in to check on me again and held my hair while I vomited. He asked if there was anything he could do, I said that unless he could pull my meds out of his ass we'd just have to wait it out. After I'm done throwing up he helps me back to bed. 

A little while later Greg comes back with a big glass of water *and my meds* at the time I didn't really think about it much, just assumed he found them somewhere. I was just so glad to see them that I took them and went to sleep. The next morning over breakfast Greg fessed up: he took my meds and hid them to ""prove"" I don't need them. It backfired and he apologized profusely for it. I didn't say anything at all, just I needed time to think. I asked for space and left his apartment.

It's been a few days, I've been mulling over what happened, and I'm conflicted. On one hand I'm furious at him, he's known since day one that I was officially diagnosed with migraines since day one. I've never lied to him, he never had a reason to doubt me. On the other hand, he seems genuinely remorseful. He told me the truth without me having to ask, he was very sorry, and he has this far honored my request for space. He's always been the type to admit when he wrong and never repeat mistakes, so I'm fairly confident that if I do forgive this it'll never happen again. 

I'm second guessing myself though because when I talked about this to a girl friend of mine she said I was crazy for even considering taking Greg back. She says that messing with medication is something that should never be forgiven and I'd be condoning his behaviour by taking him back. I was definitely leaning towards forgive and move on before this conversation but now I'm not so sure. 

TL;dr boyfriend hid my migraine medication from me until I got very ill then gave it back. I'm sure he regrets it and I want to forgive him, but my friend says I shouldn't."
23,"My GF(F27) and I(M35) have a disagreement: she doesn't get anything out of sex, and doesn't want to do it anymore. I do. Can you guys please help us find a compromise?


We've been together for almost 7 years now, have a 5 year old kid together. I'm at a loss. 


She says she doesn't get anything out of the sex. I tried explaining how I feel when we're having sex, the intimacy, the rising of the emotions, the teasing, everything. She doesn't feel any of that. 


Sex is one of the best and greatest things I feel a couple could have together, and now it doesn't look like it's ever going to happen again. 


We tried to reach a compromise yesterday when she told me, but we couldn't find any. What the fuck am I going to do?


TL;DR

GF of seven years want celebacy. I don't. Help!"
24,"I [29f] have recently started getting debilitating migraines and my husband of 5 years [31m] is the worst support system ever. Help me figure out how to talk to him?


We've been together for 7 years, but until now have never had to help each other through health issues. And frankly, my husband is really letting me down.

To make a long story short, I started getting some pretty scary symptoms about a month ago and have since been diagnosed with classic migraine with aura. For those not familiar, a migraine aura can cause things like intense vision changes, vision loss, slurred speech, numbness, and more... and at least in my case it's a precursor to a MAJOR headache. Like, lock myself in a dark, quiet room and try not to move for fear of vomiting or passing out while the room spins around me kind of pain. 8 out of 10 pain at least. It's horrible and lasts for hours. It has happened 4 times in the last month.

The first time it happened, I called my husband in a panic thinking I was having a stroke (no idea why I didn't just call 911, but I was scared and not thinking straight). By the time he got to me, the scary aura symptoms had passed and I felt fine, until about a half hour later when the headache started. 

I should mention that sometimes I have anxiety issues which can be frustrating for my husband because he's very much a ""take things as they come"" kind of person and doesn't understand my tendency to expect the worst or plan for worst-case-scenarios. So when I called him panicking and describing the changes to my vision and tingly feeling I had in my face and arm, I felt like he just brushed it off as anxiety and didn't take me seriously at all.. but he was at least good about the headache afterward. 

Anyway, I have seen multiple doctors now and been diagnosed with migraines and given medication that I'm supposed to take as soon as I feel one coming on. But it's kind of a heavy duty medication, I can only take a max of 2 in a day and shouldn't take more than 9 or 10 pills in an entire month. 

I'm feeling really scared and anxious and depressed about this, and he's been brushing me off and making me feel like it's ""all in my head"" or I'm somehow causing this to happen by worrying about it.   He's also pretty anti-medication in general (won't even take tylenol) which caused a big fight last night in the middle of a migraine because he felt like I shouldn't take anything and he was worried about whatever side effects I might get. He also didn't seem to believe me that it was happening, because earlier in the day I had a sun spot in my vision and mentioned that I felt like an idiot for forgetting the medication at home in case it was the start of a migraine. That turned out to be nothing but weirdly enough I did get a migraine about 6 hours later, at which point I wanted to take the new medication and my husband didn't believe me that it was happening for real.

Basically, I'm not getting the support I need. Instead of being understanding or listening when I talk about how scared I feel, my husband is making me feel like it's all in my head and I'm just letting my imagination get away from me, and doesn't want me taking the medication I was prescribed. I don't feel like he understands how scary this is for me, especially because I don't know what is triggering it yet.   


So, how can I talk to him about this and let him know I need him to be more supportive when he can't possibly understand something he hasn't experienced first-hand?   


**TL;DR - I started getting migraines with crazy vision changes and a bunch of other scary symptoms. Prescribed medication, but the first time I wanted to take it my husband tried to talk me out of it and we had a big fight (which of course made the migraine worse). I don't feel like he believes me that this is happening and I don't feel supported at all. Not sure what to do or how to talk to him?**"
25,"My husband [28M] is working with the girl [28F] who bullied me [28F] for years.


Hey guys

My husband Elliot is a nurse and recently moved to a new hospital to complete further training. At this hospital there is a doctor called Rachel whom both he and me happened to have gone to school with

I hate Rachel with a passion. She is the most disgusting and cruel person I have ever met. She bullied me from the very moment we met. Sorry I don't even think bullying is the right word. She made up a horrible nickname for me which spread around the school, then came the insults about my appearance, my weight, making fun of my voice, etc. My school was near a rough area, and at the time there was a bit of a gang violence problem. Rachel and her friends were all pretty girls with rich parents, but they liked hanging out with the bad boys. At one point they played a prank where the thugs all walked to me, backed me into the wall and said they were going to hurt me, and I was sobbing in fear until Rachel came out and practically everyone was laughing at me. I had nightmares for years. She and her friends also photoshopped my head onto a naked body and spread ''my'' pictures around the school, which completely humiliated and shamed me. She once got her friends to all write statements saying I was picking on her and scaring her, and even got her parents to claim that I was bullying her for being pretty. I looked like the bully and got suspended. Because she never hit me and only picked on me verbally I couldn't get anything to prove how cruel she was. The day I left school and never saw her again was the happiest day in my life. 

Elliot was the one good thing in my life during school days, and we got together, moved in together and got married, and we couldn't be happier. I am working as a primary school teacher.

Elliot came home last week saying he thought he saw Rachel at the hosp. He wasn't sure if it was her so he got on with his work. However, he ran into her again and they had a little chat. She asked if he was still with (*the nickname she used to call me*) and he said yes he was, and not to call me that. She then changed the subject and asked if he'd like to come to a house party she was going to on friday, as all her friends would be there and she thought they'd want to see him. He made clear to her that he was not her friend, or even her colleague since they work in different departments, and that he didn't want anything to do with her. 

After he told me this I got curious. I looked her up on social media. I always assumed that with the amount of drinking, weed and coke she did at school she'd end up ugly and ruined by now. Instead, she's even more beautiful than she was before. Her facebook profile says she went to a great uni. I googled her name and she's made a complete success of her life. She was always effortlessly smart in school days but by now the reputation she has in her field is unbelievable. I know I sound jealous and petty, and I am satisfied with my life. I'm happily married to a man I love and work a job I enjoy, but it feels like Rachel has everything she's ever wanted, and the fact that she still calls me the name I hate means she's just as nasty as before. I had to have therapy for years because of her, and it just seems like nothing bad ever happens to her. I still sometimes the fat girl who nobody feels sorry for because the bully is a pretty girl.

I was happy to hear that Elliot told her where to go, but out of the blue on the weekend Rachel followed him on Instagram and added him on snapchat. He blocked her on both, and says that if she tries to speak to him in person again he will report her. He also said that if I don't feel comfortable with him being near her he will leave the hospital, though that may jeopardise his future training and career ambitions, so I don't want that for him. Is there anything else we can do?

tl;dr: The girl who picked on me back in school works in the same place as my husband and he is thinking of leaving due to this, even though it may damage his career."
26,"Was I (21F) unfair to break up with my boyfriend (21M) of three years over his behavior on a trip to Paris?


Last weekend was my sister's wedding, her husband is French and they had the wedding in Paris. My boyfriend and I flew in Friday night and came home a couple days ago on Tuesday. 

We had decided to make a short trip out of the occasion by spending Monday sightseeing around the city. We were there when the fire broke out in Notre Dame. There were crowds of people all along the river and bridges watching it. It was a really weird and sad experience, even being tourists, just knowing everyone else who lived there was in shock.

So we were among that crowd when my boyfriend started making a couple ""edgy"" comments then telling me to relax when I didn't find it funny. I told him it was not the time or place (he's very outspoken, and likes to inject politics into situations to argue with people, I could see he was headed in that direction). He didn't take the hint and ended up talking loudly about how no one cares about colonization destroying indigenous people's lives but they cry in the streets at a symbol of ""whiteness and western hegemony"" being destroyed. I was really annoyed and embarrassed by this point. Then he said, ""who cares, it's not like anyone's even gonna know what I'm saying"" (because we were speaking in English) But I saw people giving him unpleasant looks so obviously some did.

Basically the entire thing was super embarrassing. This is not the first time he's gone on a random politically-charged rant in a public setting. Also his opinions he just gets from people on twitter. It's not like he spends a lot of time really learning about history or anything. I don't know, I guess it was just the breaking point for me not just the rudeness given what was going on but the way he likes to provoke people. He puts on this performance of outrage sometimes, that is very disproportionate to whatever he's lecturing someone about. It's hard to explain.

When we went back to the hotel he was annoyed at me for being annoyed. He also kept trying to argue his reason why the fire wasn't a big deal. I'm sick of this whole attitude he has. I'm politically progressive too, but I don't act like a jackass about it.

Anyway, we got home tuesday and later that night I tried to talk through it with him. He didn't use to be like this, I thought there was a chance he didn't realize how it comes off and maybe he could become more aware. I tried to make my points calmly. Even doing so, he wasn't receptive. He called me oversensitive, then got angry I'm ""not working to unlearn biases and he is"". Wtf does that even mean. How is a dangerous accident where everyone's in shock an appropriate place to grandstand about totally unrelated things like colonization?? The conversation was extremely frustrating. I told him, if he can't even listen to me then I'm not going to stick around to be talked over like his is the only view allowed. He said ""So you're just breaking up with me? That's it?"" I'd meant I was going to leave his place but in that moment I found myself saying yes. It was like I suddenly realized he exhausts me when he gets like this. If he wouldn't change, could I see myself putting up with it for the rest of my life? No way.

I went home and he's been texting me and getting his friends to text me since then. He probably told them some skewed version of what happened, because now they're defending him and think I'm heartless. He wants to know ""why"" I broke up with him...that's incredible to me. I literally said the problem. He didn't care enough to listen or he'd know the answer to that, right? He's begging me to explain and I just..... don't want to go through it again. 

Was I a total ""B""-word to break it off? What about to ignore his texts? Like I said, he used to be very caring. He respected me a lot and now the past few months he just acts condescending and like I'm less smart and moral than him. I am still in love with who he used to be so it's hard. I just can't stand this ""other"" way he's become.

TL;DR: I broke up with my boyfriend for a woke-Twitter style rant he went on while we were visiting Paris when Notre Dame caught fire. Overall he has become generally disrespectful to me and others. I'm having doubts whether I gave up on him too soon..."
27,"I (27f) hate sleeping with my husband (28m).


And no, I don’t mean having sex, that aspect is great. I mean the actual physical act of sleeping. My husband and I have two very different sleeping styles. He moves around a lot, always ends up in the middle or diagonal across our bed, while snoring no matter what position he is in, and loves to cuddle. I am still, I like my space, and I’m light sleeper. Our whole relationship has basically been me staying awake , while he is fast asleep, trying to get comfortable for 2 hours ion a sliver of the bed, to the point of exhaustion that I nudge him and try to fall asleep in the 2 minutes he won’t be snoring. I’ve brought it up to him, that it’s hard for me, I get up later now that Ive been with him because I’m physically exhausted, I stopped my usual morning workouts because I’m too tired. I thought it’d get use to it - but it’s been 4 years - and I’m at my breaking point. He tells me all couples sleep together and it’s what we are supposed to do. And I feel like I won’t end up being with my dream man because I can’t ever get a good nights sleep. As I am writing this he is blowing the roof off the house with the dead weight of his arm and leg across my body.  I’ve mentioned putting a bed in my home office so I can sleep in their at night and he looks at me like I’m insane. 



Has anyone else experienced this? How do you tell your spouse you would honestly like a separate bed to maintain your sanity? 


TLDR; Mine and my husband’s sleep styles don’t mesh well. I’ve been exhausted for 4 years. How do I tell him I want my own bed?"
28,"The guy (M 22) I’m (F 22) seeing freaked out when I suggested we talk about our relationship, blamed it on me getting into graduate school and developing a superiority complex


I don’t want to got to any of my close friends or family about this, because I really like this guy and we’ve been seeing each other for months— and god forbid this is all a misunderstanding, and I’ve suddenly made my support system hate him.

I’ve been seeing him since November of 2018. There have been a few red flags here and there with his temper, but that was mostly in the beginning and things got better once I told him I’m a survivor of an abusive relationship (aside: i escaped that relationship in 2017. My abuser was extremely intelligent and manipulative, as abusers so often are, so I’m highly sensitive to anything that seems like a red flag. I’m aware, though, that to a hammer everything looks like a nail— that’s why I’m here, to see if I’m overreacting.)

I contacted him yesterday to talk about our relationship. Due to his involvement in a national sports related event, he’s been extremely busy these past few weeks and we haven’t really spoken much at all. I was making sure he was still interested in seeing each other, when he blew up and accused me of coming to the conversation with an agenda. He said that I think I’m better than him and want to kick him while he’s down, because I had just managed to (by the skin of my teeth) land a spot in the graduate program I was anxiously waiting to hear back from.

This led to him accusing me of being a liar, of being manipulative, of thinking I’m better than others, of having a “subconscious superiority complex”. During this argument he used a lot of the same language my abuser would use, but I didn’t want to panic in front of him lest it look like I’m using my tears to get what I want— based on how the conversation was going, I knew he’d see me getting emotional as a tactic rather than a genuine response.

I don’t believe I used my acceptance into the program as a way to make him feel condescended to. We hardly spoke about it at all, and if I did make him feel like I thought of him as lesser than me, it was entirely unintentional because I absolutely do not think he’s any better or worse than I am.

I had a weird panic attack episode on my bathroom floor at 2 am (it was just so incredibly reminiscent of how my abusive relationship from the past began) which led to me wondering if I’m overreacting due to past trauma, or if this is a red flag. In any case, it hurt being shamed for something I found so incredibly exciting— I’m a first generation college student, so managing to get into this program on my own was such an achievement and a relief. Even saying that now, I wonder if I’m being the holier-than-thou person he accused me of being.

TL;DR
The guy I’m seeing went off on me because I wanted to discuss our relationship, his verbiage was very reminiscent of abuse I’ve faced in the past. Is this a red flag or am I being paranoid due to previous trauma?"
29,"My boyfriend (28m) is upset with me (24f) because of how much I cried at my ex's (23m) funeral




I walked in the forest behind the graveyard for a while, and really let go of my emotions once I was somewhere private. I'm sure I looked a mess, snot and tears all over my face, all red and splotchy, etc... I cleaned up as best as I could before I went back to the parking lot, but I'm sure I'd obviously been crying hard.

On the ride back, I was pretty quiet. Kyle mentioned that he had never seen me cry like that before, and I told him that I don't really like crying in front of people. He asked me if I wanted to talk about how I was feeling, and I said that would be nice.

I told him how unfair it all seemed, for him to be killed in a drunk driving accident when the asshole who hit him lived. And how it was obviously before his time, he'd just been accepted to med school and had so much going for him, and so much to look forward to. The more I talked, the more quiet Kyle got. Once I'd let it all out, he didn't have much to say back. I was tearing up during a lot of the car ride, so he just drove while I cried a little.

Yesterday, I was feeling a little better. And I had plans to go out with Kyle for dinner. During that dinner, Kyle told me how it felt weird to him, that I cried my eyes out for my ex, but he's hardly seen me cry at all throughout out own relationship, even tough parts. He's seen my eyes water and me choke back crying, but that's about it. 

He commented on how I didn't cry like that when we almost broke up before going long distance, when we argued in the past about stuff, when we went through stress together like career stress or friend drama. And how it felt ""off"" to him that I'd have such a different level of emotion towards my ex. I got frustrated and snapped at him ""Well you aren't dead, are you? It's different. Any of that stuff can be fixed... This can't, and that's what hurts the most."" 

I didn't know where to go from here. I feel upset that Kyle made this about himself, when it didn't have to be, and when I was already greiving. And I think he still feels betrayed because I care so much about my ex??? 

Help me put myself in his shoes? And help me find a way to explain my emotions to him that won't make him feel bad?

tl;dr , I cried a lot at my ex's funeral. My boyfriend is upset because, to him, it looks like I cared too much for my ex."
30,"Fiance (F 29) has kissed a good friend (M 33) in front of me (M 31) No idea what to do now


Had a great day out with my fiance and a close friend and his wife. Had a fun day of drinking and nice food, ending in going back to my friend's place. I spent some time chatting to friend's wife in an amicable manner. I turn round and see my fiance (7 year relationship) passionately kissing my friend. I immediately call them out and proceed to leave. Friend is apologising to me via text. Am I right to feel aggrieved and feel like both my friendship and engagement is over. Or am I overreacting? Just not sure what to do or feel, so hurt and angry. Not sure how two people I love could do this to me 

TL:DR 2 people who I love have made me question both relationships"
31,"Brother [28m] is a little intense when it come to ""protecting"" my sister [17f] and I [17f] when going out or staying with him. He thinks it's his ""duty"". What to do?


Maybe protecting is not totally accurate but more like, making sure we are comfortable, even when we are not really into his ""help"".

He pulls every chair he can for us, opens/holds doors, holds our hands crossing the street and makes hand gestures like saying ""stop"" and ""go"". If we are going up a automatic stair he'll want to be below us when going up or down, and he'll be on the side closer to the cars walking on the sidewalk. When we stay at his place he's always asking if we are OK, if we want a blanket, are we hungry.

I mean I see how what he's doing is nice and sweet, but it's also a little, exhausting. Like, if i don't ask for anything in particular maybe he shouldn't go out of his way to get what I haven't asked for?

I talked to him about it and he said he did it because it was his duty to make sure we were safe and comfortable when he's around. I asked if he would want to tone it down to the essential stuff and let go of everything else and he said he'd try, but hasn't really changed anything, and that was I think 4 weeks ago.

I don't want to seem ungrateful, just that all of this seems a little bit too much and it gets a little uncomfortable. How would I express all of this maybe without seeming like I don't appreciate it, and so he will go a little easier about it?

**tl;dr:** Brother kinda goes a little too far in trying to make us comfortable when we are with him. How to bring it up without seeming ungrateful?"
32,"[Update] Struggling with staying or leaving my (28F) boyfriend (30M) of 8 years


I wanted to give you guys an update. [Original post here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/9i208c/struggling_with_staying_or_leaving_my_28f/)


TLDR: We broke up, I feel relieved, and life is good


It's now a few months after the fact. I broke up with him. It took two tries. The first time, he kind of talked me out of it, in part because he seemed to be taking my concerns seriously. I wanted to get to the point where I was 100% sure. It took a couple more months.


Sidenote: Someone commented on my original post about a book, Too Good to Leave, Too Bad to Stay. I read the whole thing and during the first attempted breakup conversation, we actually went through the questions together and talked about each one, both of our perspectives. 


In the two months between the initial conversation and the final breakup, nothing changed, on his end. He started paying me back but I had to nag him about it. No changes to his career progression, exercise routine, attentiveness in bed, anything. I even bought him a book about making sex better for women and he acted like he didn't even want to read it, even after I said how helpful I thought it would be towards improving our sex life.


The breakup conversation was the hardest conversation of my life. It was short, since we had already discussed everything the first time. I'm grateful that he took it well, all things considered. He was upset of course but still civil and mature with me. To anyone reading this, I don't recommend you expect this! I was prepared to sleep somewhere else that night (but I ended up sleeping on the couch in the living room).


Just before/after the breakup, a lot of things happened at once, to the point where I have started to question my vaguely spiritual agnosticism as a religious approach. The major events were:


- I went on what was basically a date (I didn't cheat but only barely). This man treated me really well and showed me what I had been missing from a romantic partner. He also, without giving too many details, works in an industry that could have helped with one of my main concerns about the breakup. I didn't ask him for help but it was a nice coincidence.


- Our roommate decided to move out and gave us about two days notice to decide whether to take over the lease. I had wanted to postpone the breakup for a few more days but this was the push I needed to put everything out there.


- A new, perfect, living situation fell into my lap and everything moved really quickly. It only took two days between when I responded to the ad and when I was signing the lease. The new place is in the same town, so the move went smoothly and quickly. Since then, I'm happy to say that it's still really good! I get along great with my new roommates and I love the environment. I also love having my own bedroom for the first time in years!


- A month after the breakup, the man I had a crush on for over a year asked me out! We spent a couple of nights together. It didn't end up working out, but it was a huge ego boost and I'm grateful that we got to try.


In general, I'm really enjoying my freedom, now. Reading back over my old post, it's kind of obvious that this would be the outcome, but it took me a full year from starting to think about breaking up as an option, to the point when I was 100% sure. I'm glad that I let myself go through that process, even though it may look like wasted time. By the time I had the breakup conversation, I was absolutely certain that nothing could change my mind and I'd given it everything I had. I have no regrets."
33,"Bf (28) wants to be single and date other women as he was a virgin when he met me (25).We’ve been together for five years.


TL:DR Bf (28) wants to be single and date other women as he was a virgin when he met me (25F)

He said This looks bad on paper but if he’s being honest and true to himself he wants to explore as this is what people do on their 20s. He didn’t get to explore as he had a low self esteem before he met me and was bullied. I was his first girlfriend. He lost his virginity to me. 

Through your dating life he has slowly gained more confidence as he’s a bodybuilder and is quite fit. Not sure if he’s gotten more attention from the opposite sex but this is how he feels. 

He also said he’s just being honest. When I got upset he said “would u rather me cheat on u??”
He said give me enough time to date around and when I’m ready to come back to u I will. I can date around too if I want. He said If I decide I don’t wanna come back anymore to him it’s a risk he’s willing to take .

So he’s basically asking for a break and if I still love him when he’s done, he’ll come back. If not, he’ll be devastated but he wants to go ahead with it anyway.

Do you guys think He’s being reasonable given I was his first relationship? I should also mention I have numerous sexual partners before him and  he said you would know how I feel. He said he wished he’d met me in the future as he knows I’m the one"
34,"I [24F] was asked out by my boss [40?M]; turned him down and he took it badly. I am stressed over him retaliating and my boyfriend [28M] is choosing to act jealous and angry instead of supporting me


There is a Very Important Guy in my work called Paul. Paul is directly in charge of several of the projects I work on. Paul and I have never interacted outside of work context. 

Last week I went to hand him some documents and he started praising my work on those projects, then my intelligence and attitude and eventually blatantly hit on me and asked me out to drinks. I was shocked and tried to turn him down diplomatically but firmly best as I could in the moment. He insisted at first and then turned pretty angry and told me he thought I was “smarter than that” (wtf) and some other unpleasant things. 

I am now massively stressing out. Paul has a lot of ways to make my life hell if he takes it personally. I know some of you are gonna be like “girl go to HR” but my field is still very sexist and conservative and Paul makes a lot of money for the firm. They are going to pick him over me 100 time out of 100. 

And if the worst comes to pass and I need another job, I am on a visa so that makes things even harder (not that it would be busy anyway, my field isn’t exactly popping with vacancies). 

So I vented about all of this to my boyfriend of a year, of course, pretty much as it happened. Previously we have had an awesome relationship with very strong communication and I honestly felt we were a great match. 

Instead of being supportive he has since been jealous and clingy, constantly asking if Paul’s around (he is in fact on a business trip), if I found Paul attractive, if Paul is coming to a work event, etc. Let me be clear that his tone is not of concern but of jealousy. I called him out on it and he pretty much told me I can’t expect not to make him jealous when I spend so much time at work with this guy (I don’t spend time WITH Paul; sometimes we work similar intense long hours, and sometimes we work them on the same project but Paul is several rungs above me. I report my work to him, maybe a short discussion together and then he gives updated instructions; I have the same relationship with several other superiors).

Boyfriend is also totally twisting my words. For example: “you told me you found \[Paul\] hot for fuck’s sake!”. What he’s referring to is when I first told him of the situation he started asking me about Paul and one of the things he asked was “is he like a creepy ugly old guy” and I answered something to the tune of “he’s maybe 40, you know this wholesome in shape type with good hair and a nice suit and a fake wide smile with super white teeth” which I think is very descriptive of Paul and VERY different from me finding him hot. 

I just really need support right now and I am freaking out and my boyfriend is failing me big time, I really can’t be managing his insecurities while I am falling apart.

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR: a very important seniour at my work who is charge of several of my projects took it very negatively when I turned him down. I am afraid if he chooses to take revenge. My boyfriend is acting super jealous instead of supportive."
35,"Would it be weird if I [20/F] were to message an old teacher [60’s/F]


So, when I was in elementary school (seventh and eighth grade) we had a regular substitute teacher. She was amazing. Your typical hippie woman complete, with crystals and a never ending wealth of wisdom. She found the good in the worst kids and encouraged them to strive to be the best person they could. She could look at someone and immediately have something kind and caring to say. 



I only spoke to her a handful of times but every time I left the conversation I felt amazing. She had such a huge impact on the person I am now, to the point that I consistently look up to her as a role model. 



I hope to be just like her when I reach her age and constantly think of her when I make certain life choices. It sounds weird, but she really was such a pure and genuine human. I’ve never met anyone like her thus far. 



I summed that up the best I could, so now on to the question...Would it be weird if I reached out to her and explained how much of an impact she had on me? I recently came across her Facebook page and wanted to reach out. 



Tl;dr: A substitute teacher I had regularity during middle school left such a lasting impression on me, would it be weird if I reached out to her several years later on Facebook to tell her the impact she had on my life?"
36,"My sister's husband [32M] kissed me [26F]. I don't know if/how to tell my sister [30F]?


I was at a party Saturday night and my sister was also there with her husband. I went outside for a smoke and then he (my sister’s husband) joined me. He asked me if I was okay, and honestly, I wasn’t – my boyfriend broke up with me a couple weeks ago and I had got drunk and emotional. I started unloading all my emotions on him and he was being really nice and comforting and then he kissed me. 

I pulled away and he was like oh shit, that was a mistake, please don’t tell. I said I wouldn’t but I felt so weird about it. I left the party straight away to avoid my sister. I was supposed to meet up with her on Sunday but I told her I was to hungover to go. I know I can’t avoid her forever but I feel really guilty about what happened.

Should I tell her? I know she deserves to know but it’s going to my word against his? I think she will believe him over me. They have been together for like 6 years, she’s never told me of any problems. I feel so guilty though, i'm dreading seeing her but I can't avoid her forever. Should I talk to him first? any advice?

TLDR: my sisters husband kissed me. I don't know if/how to tell her"
37,"I(30F) don't want my boyfriend's(32M) unhygienic friend(30sM) ruining my furniture when we move into together.


My boyfriend and I have been together for two years, and are planning on moving in together to a new apartment in August. There's just one problem - he has an old friend we'll call Frank, who he sees at least once a week, who STINKS. And his stench lingers for DAYS. I can walk into my boyfriend's current apartment, and I can smell if Frank has been there inside of two days. Frank isn't a big guy, in fact he's pretty fit. My boyfriend is aware of the issue and thinks it's Frank's feet, but he lives in basically a hippie commune so his clothes aren't very clean. But for whatever the reason, he's got the Midas touch of stank; anything he comes across stinks for days.  And this may sound incredibly immature and petty but I have really nice furniture, and I don't want this guy to ruin all my stuff. It's to the point where I'm seriously considering just not bringing my things and leaving them in storage because I'm so afraid of them getting ruined.   
My boyfriend is well aware of Frank's problem, but other than a ""yeah, that guy reeks"", I don't get anything else from him. Though really, what else is he going to say about one of his oldest friends. What do I do here Reddit?  


TLDR; My boyfriend's friend stinks. We're moving in together, I have nice stuff, I don't want my stuff to stink. What do I do?"
38,"I [25m] realized I have been a pretty bad brother to my sister [25f], who suffers some sort of dyslexia-like condition. What can I do to be better?


My sister has always suffered some sort dyslexic problem. It wasn't obvious I guess as a child (who lost our mom at 10 and have been living with our aunt ever since) but through high school she had terrible grades and I would mock her handwriting and be extremely frustrated when she wouldn't get the most simple of subjects for class.

Sometimes she would cry and I would get even more frustrated. We didn't get along particularly well. I went to college but she stayed back home and did several sewing courses, then started a sewing business and today she's got a very solvent means for a living.

I went back to our home after college and I work in our home city. We live together. We got an important document that we both needed to sign, about the ownership of the home. We had been speaking to a lawyer so I handed it to her without saying anything, as the header and the text are self explanatory in the context of our legal talks. She only had to skim over it and sign.

I came back about half hour later and she was hardly reading it, barely making out the words. I asked her what was up and she stared blankly at me, it all kinda came together for me and I asked her ""can you even read?"". She got uncomfortable and I asked 3 more times before she said that, no, she didn't know what even the paper reads.

I laughed incredulously and said a few things in a mean tone that she didn't deserve, about her being essentially illiterate after all this time. In the end she said, why do you even care and garbled something where she was supposed to sign. She seemed on the verge of crying.

That happened a few days ago and I've been thinking that I was really out of line, she didn't deserve that interrogation and it made me realize that I haven't really been kind or patient to her, not only in the context of these difficulties she's got, but in general.

She's a kind person and honestly she's almost all I've got in terms of close family. I want to give her a hug and apologize and let her know I love her and she can come to me about anything. Living with her has been very good for me and I want her to know I appreciate her love and support.

How should I apologize to her? What would I do to have a better relationship with her? Is there a way to get her help about her condition? What can I do to be better for her in general?

**tl;dr:** I said cruel things about my sister's apparent reading disability and it made me realize I haven't been treating her kindly lately, or ever. How can I be a better brother for her?"
39,"My sister (22f) got nominated to be on a home and wardrobe makeover reality show but I (26f) don't want to be a part of it. We share an apartment




My younger sister, Jess, got nominated to be on a makeover type reality show. Basically the show hosts come make over her wardrobe and home. She is super excited about it, and there's just one issue. We live together in an apartment and I don't want to be on TV, I don't want my private living space to be on TV, etc. I'd be fine with them filming in the shared areas and her bedroom, but not my bedroom or my bathroom.

But the show would be filmed in our apartment, and they even wanted me to be a part of it, have a little interview about my sister, her fashion sense, what it's like living together

I asked if it would be an option for me to leave for a week and a half, just go spend that time with our parents, and lock my bedroom door when I was out. And they could do a little movie magic to pretend she lives alone (because afaik the show won't openly say 'she lives with her sister who didn't want to be on tv"" )

Jess is afraid they'll take back the offer to have her on the show, she got the impression that they want to show people's lives honestly, and family and friends is a part of it.

I really don't want to be a part of this, but I also know how much my sister wants it, and how amazing it would be to have our apartment made over with no cost to us. 

I want her to at least ask the people from the show if they could just leave me out, pretend the apartment is all hers, and let me head off when filming happens. But she is scared they'll take back the offer if she asks for that. What do we do?

tl;dr my sister and I Live together. She has a chance to be on reality TV, but I don't want to be filmed.. not sure if that's possible."
40,"I [24F] agreed to walk this older woman's [70s] puppy for a discounted rate, but now I'm afraid she thinks she can take advantage of me


I'm in grad school and I walk dogs on the side for some extra cash. I was walking a dog one day about 2-3 months ago, and this older woman named Velvet was outside with her puppy. She called me over, the dogs played well together, and Velvet asked if I would be interested in walking her dog sometimes as well. That's how we met.

I agreed to walk her dog as well, and was happy to do so. Velvet didn't know how to use the app that I'm on, so I said it was fine, she could just pay me in cash. I normally get paid $15 for a half-hour walk, but Velvet said she couldn't afford that. That's fine, I agreed to do it for $10. I'm still making money, and she seemed sweet. Both of our schedules are flexible, so we agreed that we would figure out times for me to come over as we went. I typically do 4 walks a week, sometimes more if I'm available. I will also do small chores for her, yard work, moving heavy things, etc. She says she'll pay me extra for it, but she doesn't. The tasks are quick (typically take less than 5 minutes), but it just adds to my feelings.

Anyways, our dog-walker/owner relationship has been mostly okay, but there have been a few incidents where Velvet's bothered me. For example, she got upset with me for taking on other dog-sitting/walking gigs that conflicted with times she wanted me to come over. This happened last week when I was walking her puppy during lunch, she asked me to come by later that evening for a second walk. I told her that I was already scheduled for another dog. She said something like, ""I give you such regular business you shouldn't be taking on other dogs right now."" I think she thinks she's doing me a favor, but I feel like I'm doing her one. I'm giving her a discount and I come over any times she asks when I'm available. Also her dog is a puppy, so she's not the easiest dog to walk. Velvet also expects me to train the dog when we're out on walks not to pull and such. I don't mind, but it's just to say there is extra work that goes into it.

Another slightly annoying incident just happened this morning. I'm sick with a bad cold (maybe the flu?) and I texted Velvet letting her know. We hadn't scheduled a walk for today, but I figured she would probably text me asking for one. I told her that I would probably be feeling better tomorrow and I could do two walks, one at lunch and one in the evening. She responded saying, ""Just my luck!"" and that she was counting on the walk today after I had been out of town visiting family over the weekend.

Anyways, whenever things like this have happened, I've been clear with her about my schedule and availability. However, I've never run much of a business before and I'm not sure whether my efforts to be nice to an older lady have turned into her feeling like she can take advantage of me.

TL;DR: Agreed to walk Velvet's dog for a reduced rate, but she expects me to be there at her beck and call."
41,"My (23F) best friend (23M) of 5 years gave me an ultimatum. How do I handle this?


He wants to date or not be friends at all. I have a boyfriend of almost a year that I am completely in love with. That said, I feel completely broken up with this decision of my best friends and I don't really know how to move past it. 

I have been getting really depressed about it because I understand that it's hard to be just friends with someone you love, but I don't understand how he can just throw away our friendship when we have been through so much. 

I guess I'm just looking for advice on how to handle this whether that means talking to him and continuing to try to be friends (we haven't seen eachother in about 11 months because of this) or just moving on away from the friendship. Thanks in advance.

42,"Hispanic me [27F] with my white boyfriend of 5 years [27 M] who said wearing a headband and earrings made me look too hispanic or like a cleaning lady


My Bf and I have been together for over 5 years. I'm Hispanic (very tan, Central American parents) and my bf is white. He's made odd comments before and family of his have mistaken me for being a daughter of the family housekeeper before.

My bf and I were getting ready to go to a farmers market in the park, and I was wearing a really thick sports headband, and decided to wear some long earrings. He looked at me and says ""Umm that makes you look REALLY Hispanic"". I was kind of confused about what he meant, since I am Hispanic and don't pass for white at all. Then he says ""well you look kind of like a cleaning lady"". I guess his parents housekeepers, and cleaning women he has encountered must have kept their hair back with headbands. Either way, I told him that saying I look hispanic = I look like a cleaning lady is racist, even if it was a subconscious racist comment. He begins going off about how it isn't racist, its just biased. I'm not really sure he gets it, and I think he just doesn't like the idea of thinking of himself as being able to accidentally make a racist comment. Am I wrong here? 

tldr; my bf said I look really hispanic when he meant I look like a cleaning lady, either way I think its racist"
43,"My girlfriend's (17) Mom is blaming me for her being in the hospital.


So quick little backstory, my gf has type 1 diabetes and has been trying to lose weight. I (19) have been losing weight doing the keto diet and did a little bit of research and saw that most type 1 diabetics have had lots of success with the diet. She saw the success I had with it and I suggested it but I can not stress this part enough. I told her to make SURE she talked to the doctor before trying it. Her mom agreed but eventually told her to do it so she can fit into her prom dress instead of asking the doctor.

This Friday after a week of keto she is throwing up and showing signs of dka (Diabetic ketoacidosis)   . Her mom said it was just a stomach bug and because she diabetic she gets it worse which I know is true but this seemed different to me. So 1pm on that friday I head over and her mom isn't home she is with her boyfriend. So I take care of her for a couple of hours and decide that she should go to the hospital. Her mom disagrees and I go home. 

Then the next morning I get a call from my gf saying how she is going to the hospital and it was in fact dka. Now the doctor tells us its from the keto diet and explains why it caused it. After that her mom kept saying how it was my fault,and I got really upset and argued my case saying that I TOLD HER not to do it without talking to the doctor. I did not curse , I didn't say anything that was disrespectful just simply stated my case. She then says how if her brothers heard me talking to her like that, that they would beat me up even though I wasn't (In my eyes) being disrespectful at all.

Now I love my gf she amazes me everyday and I am so in love with her but being that she is younger I will have to deal with her mother for quite some time. I felt disrespected because I always help them out ether doctors appointments or just going to see their family because I have a car they don't. So at this point I'm very upset and would like some advice.

44,"My [21F] friend/roommate [19F] is convinced her mother is dead when she's still alive


We have been friends for a year and a half. Early on she told me her mother was dead. But then I met her mother. Her actual, factual, biological mother. Not adoptive, step, or other mother substitute. Confirmed by her brother. Yet my friend is still convinced her mother is dead. I've pointed out that her mother was still alive several times but she doesn't care. She goes on and on about how she misses her mother and what a great person she was and hopes to see her in the afterlife.

Hell, we went over to her mom's house today for Easter. They hugged and talked. Outside of this, my friend is completely normal.

Is this a common delusion? What should I do?

TL;DR my friend thinks her mom is dead when she's still alive"
45,"Did I (15M) treat my friend (23M) badly?


I met L. a few months ago on Discord. We mostly talked about the different games we play. We're also both gay and I was happy that I could talk about that openly, since I'm not out to any of my real life friends or family.

Anyway L. and I come from the same city. He lives near a store that sells a gaming mouse I wanted. So he offered to buy it for me, and I could give him money when we met up. Last week we did that. I was pretty nervous about it because I look up to L., and I was afraid he wouldn't like me in person because I'm very socially awkward.

L. was nice, though. We walked around the city a little and visited different stores. We also went to McDonald's together. That was when I started feeling uneasy because he kept asking me if I would come back to his car, and we could drive to someplace better in his neighborhood. He actually didn't ask, just said it in a matter-of-fact way.

I wasn't expecting to drive anywhere with him, and I'd told my parents I would only be hanging out in center city. So that's what I said to L., but he insisted because we could go to that gaming store near his place where he wanted to buy something.

I just had a really freaky feeling in my gut about the whole thing, so I made up a story about history homework I forgot. I think that's when he figured out I was uncomfortable because he laughed and said something like, ""we're friends, I'm not trying to lure you into a back alley"". But he accepted that I had to go home, so we just hugged and said goodbye to each other.

Now I feel really embarrassed because I like L. and he's been a good friend to me. He even drove an hour just to give me that gaming mouse, and I treated him like a creep. Luckily it doesn't seem like he's bothered because we're chatting and playing together like before.

So do you guys think I overreacted? Do I owe L. an apology? What's the right thing to do?

tl;dr: I met up with a friend from Discord and I'm afraid I was shitty him and it wasn't fair."
46,"I [21M] and my girlfriend [19F] of three years mutually ended our relationship yesterday. How do I practice self care and move on when we still love each other?


My (ex) girlfriend was and still is the love of my life. We met in high school and fell in love immediately and easily. Those were some of the happiest memories and I'm so grateful to have been with her as long as I have been. After high school we went away to different colleges and were long distance for over two years. 

Yesterday we realized that the distance was making us grow farther apart than we had realized. Even though we still love each other like cray and every time we see each other is so natural and easy, we realized that we've become so codependent and need time/space to discover ourselves.

This is the first break up I've had of this magnitude. I'm still hurting obviously. I wish that we had fixed things when we could and if kind of sucks that our love wasn't enough to make this work. I also don't know how to close this chapter in my life since there wasn't some big event that ended our relationship. It just kind of died quietly and left us both with a lot of love.

Does anyone have a similar experience? How did you rationalize it? 

But I want to grow out of this. I'm really trying to use this time and space to grow into a person that I am proud of.

What are some little (or big) things that I can do to keep the dial of my life moving forward? I want to come out of this as a person that she would be proud of, but more importantly, that I am proud of.

Much love to everyone who read this and I hope only good things come your way.

TL;DR: Girlfriend and I broke up while still very much in love because of distance and codependency. Looking for ways to start loving myself and grow from this."
47,"My [26F] SO [33M] becomes extremely depressed and insufferable every year around his birthday and I just don't know what to do anymore.


**TLDR; My SO becomes extremely depressed and insufferable every year around his birthday and I just don't know what to do anymore. He makes everyone around him uncomfortable and eventually no one will want to be around him to ""celebrate.""**

Been with my SO for 4 years now, and his birthday has always sucked for him. Starting from childhood his parents ignored him on his birthday wouldn't get him anything except fast food, would just leave him to watch all his younger siblings while they went to the bar or casino; his ex-wife's birthday was 2 days before his and she always made it all about her and ignored his day; then she (because she's honestly a cold hearted person) served the divorce papers on his birthday... and so every year during his birthday week he becomes insufferable. I understand it's a trigger for his depression, but my God... Its days of walking on eggshells and a moody, angry, depressed man lingering like a dark storm cloud.

I try so hard to make his birthday happy, I make plans with him, I try to incorporate his family and friends, give him thoughtful gifts, but his attitude is so exhausting... nothing is ever enough, and when ANYTHING goes wrong (a long wait at a restaurant, bad traffic on the way out, cat throws up on the floor) he goes ""meh, my birthday sucks. Always does. Don't know why I expect anything more.""

On his birthday I made dinner plans at one of our favorite restaurants, invited his parents and siblings, and he was in a foul mood the entire time and made everyone uncomfortable. His brother even said when my SO got up to use the bathroom ""He really makes it fun to be around him."" 🙄 I won't be surprised if no one wants to come when I try to make plans next year...

And I know what you're thinking ""Well just don't make plans to go out with him on his birthday."" Well the one year I didn't plan anything he said I didn't care about him. So damned if I do, damned if I don't. 

His mom has tried to fix their relationship in recent years, but since she didn't call him to wish him a happy birthday this year, she only texted him, he took it as a gigantic slight toward him and was shitty towards her at his birthday dinner.
His one brother didn't even text him at all so he took that extremely personally. 

And last year his grandmother died and she always called him on his birthday to sing ""Happy Birthday"" and I know that's a contributing factor this year and probably will be for years to come. 

His birthday was this past weekend but he took off work today and has been in bed the last 24 hours. He was up until 4:30 this morning watching YouTube. I got home tonight and asked if he was just going to stay in bed all day. He didn't even look at me and just shrugged. So I left him up there. I've tried many things for several years and I'm the kind of person who doesn't give a shit about their birthday so I just am internally screaming because Idk what to do anymore. I don't even get a ""thanks for trying."" If I don't try I'll be yet another person who ""doesn't give a shit"" about him but no matter what I do, I can't make his birthday nice. 

He used to go to therapy, he really needs to go again. He clearly has unresolved issues. I love him very much and eventually, this will end. Like Cinderella at mightnight, it'll be like it never happened and he'll go back to normal. Until next April. I'm seriously considering next year buying him a plane ticket and paying for a hotel room for a week so he can be this way by himself."
48,"My roommate [24F] has her gf [21F] over all the time. Now there’s $5,000 missing from my room.


Ok warning, there is a lot of shit we have to unpack here.

Per my last post, my roommate’s gf (we’ll call her suzy) is constantly over at my apt. Recently suzy got a new job near my apt so she’s constantly there before and after work. She’s even there when me and my roommate aren’t home. Recently, Suzy has had friends over. One time I was there, another time I was not.

Well, yesterday I discovered that there’s $5,000~ missing from my room. 

I looked everywhere, I traced my steps, I went crazy thinking maybe I didn’t even have that much money, but after looking thru the text messages between me and my boyfriend, I was able to determine that the money had to go missing sometime within the last 3 weeks. 

In Jan I had $6,000. feb I had $7,000. And last month when I counted my money I only had $4,000~

I thought it was weird but I also was uncertain how much money I actually had. So I thought I forgot or maybe counted my chickens before they hatched. I also have an electronic savings account so I was like hmm, maybe the rest is in there.

Well yesterday when I counted I had $1,800.

No. This is absolutely wrong. There’s no way.

So I’m pissed. This is my savings that I’ve been stacking up for year saving my tip money from work. I was planning on buying a car soon or paying off my students loans with this money.

I tell my roommate and her gf. Their faces look like whatever, like how? What? Why? They say sorry and that’s really it.

My roommate comes over to my room and talks to me separately. She was actually pretty nice about it and understanding which was a relief from how she first reacted unbothered.

She said she understands if she thinks it was her gf who stole the money but she said she really doesn’t think it was her because her gf’s finances don’t add up. 

And while I think her gf is annoying for being over there all the time, I don’t think she’s a bad person and I don’t think she would steal from me.

My roommate assured me it wasn’t her or her gf and instead blames my boyfriend. 

My roommate has always hated my boyfriend from the beginning but I think she just doesn’t like him because he’s kinda nerdy and he doesn’t smoke weed. Which I know sounds stupid but for some reason it’s like a big deal to my roomie.

Tomorrow is actually my three year anniversary with my boyfriend. I love my boyfriend so much and it breaks my heart to think that it could’ve possibly been him. He literally is such an angel that’s so understanding and supportive. He actually helped me get a lot of this savings money by hooking me up with odd jobs that I could do to get some extra cash. 

— The signs that point to my boyfriend are the fact that I always texted him about how much money I have saved. We would always tell each other our progress on our savings.
— he was the last person in my room (that I know of)
— he’s the only person that’s in my room as much as I am (that I know of)
— and he’s been spending more money recently, including gifts he bought me recently and money he gave me last month and this month because of my low paychecks. 

So at this point it’s either my roommate, her gf Suzy, Suzy’s friends, my boyfriend, or my other close friend Alicia.

I am very suspicious of her gf suzy. There’s no one home more than her. she’s home even when me and my roommate aren’t around. 

I am also suspicious of her friend, Carter because the money did go missing in the last 3 weeks. There was one time I know for sure that Suzy and carter were at the house unattended because me and my roommate were at work.

Unfortunately my boyfriend is a suspect. It is suspicious that he’s been spending more money lately and he is in my room when I’m not there. He stays the night and leaves like an hour or two after I leave for work in the morning.
The only reason I don’t think it’s my bf is because I’ve been with him for three years. I know him the best out of everyone. He’s never lied to me, he’s super loyal to everyone, and he has $12,000 of his own money saved. He works 3 different jobs and owns a lot of stocks and bonds. His parents are also very well off and give him money if he’s ever stuck in a rut. I’ve also carried this stash to three different living environments and nothing has ever gone missing before. My boyfriend has been there thru all of these and I think he would’ve taken the money from me a lot sooner because this isn’t the first time I’ve saved up this much cash. 

My friend Alicia is also a suspect because she’s stayed over in my room a few times when I wasn’t there. I really don’t believe she would do that but who knows. She works two jobs and also has parents who give her money and pay her bills.

My roommate is another suspect but she works as hard as I do and I consider her a best friend. I do think that financially she would be jealous of me at times because I saved so much money and she knew that. She’s really not the best when it comes to finances but I also don’t think she would steal from me.

It was 100% an inside job because
1) my money was slowly diminishing so I wouldn’t notice. 
2) this person had access to come back and forth to slowly take my money
3) none of our other belongings in the apt have gone missing or have been messed with

At this point, I’ve accepted I’m never going to get the money back. Im over that.

What I cannot get over, is that someone I know, someone I trust, stole money from me, and that this someone is an immediate person in my life.

I’ve never had my trust broken like this before and have never felt this type of betrayal. I have so much anxiety thinking about it and I feel sick to my stomach even being around my roommate, her gf, my bf, everyone.

Now I’m just wondering where do I go from here? What should I do? 

I can’t afford to move out right now because my cushion was taken from me so I have no extra money and I don’t feel comfortable in my own apt now.

I feel like I have no where to go or anything to fall back on. I don’t want to move back in with my mom because not only will she be mad at me but she’ll probably kill every potential suspect and it’ll make an even bigger mess. 

I can’t call the police because there’s really no proof I had that much money. Renters insurance only covers $200 missing cash. There’s no cameras in my apt building. There’s nothing! 

I don’t know what to do. Any advice or analysis on the situation would be appreciated. 

*sidenote: pls don’t lecture me about leaving that much cash in my room. I’ve learned a big lesson and will never do it again.

TL;DR : One of my close friends stole $5,000 from me. No one will admit to it and now I don’t know what to do. I don’t trust anyone in my life and don’t feel comfortable in my own apt. They stole my cushion savings and now I don’t have the money to move out. I feel helpless and alone, where do I go from here?"
49,"How do I [27F] tell my parents [early 60s] that I'm not coming to Easter because it's a hostile environment?


Some backstory here: I recently moved in with my brother \[22M\] for about six months because he's in college and struggling to pay rent, and I needed to be closer to work. I've always had a pretty strained relationship with my mother, although it's been ok for a long time right up until I moved out to move back in with my partner \[28M\] as my partner had gotten a new place even closer to work for me. 

Basically, it came to light that my brother had skipped a huge chunk of rent and a magical $480 sum was needed, so that  fell to me after a lot of screaming from my parents. I ended up paying it just to stop the verbal harassment I was getting over the phone, and that paved the way for my brother to try and bleed me out of as much money as possible. Between cleaners that we apparently had to pay twice and missing keys and locks, he tried to get about $1k out of me, some of which I caved and paid to make them just stop. He doesn't have a job and has a bit of a gunpla addiction so I know where that money would have gone. 

The move came at a horrific time (I had to have surgery and neither the moving date nor the surgery could be moved so we had to move my stuff in advance) and it got to the point where my parents revoked a car (that they weren't using at all, we actually ended up buying a new battery for it) they'd let us borrow to get to and from hospital, appointments and move the last of my shit -- because I refused to pay $185 my brother was quoting me for a key that needed to be cut. He'd lived there for two years and had been through two housemates, but somehow that was my responsibility. Anyway. Whatever, the car is theirs, they can take it back as they please. It just kind of plays into the later thing. 

&amp;#x200B;

The relationship I have with my mother and brother has just rotted away into nothing. I have no contact with my brother because I was unable to ask him basic questions about the move or these 'costs' (like asking to see quotes from cleaners in writing) without getting an earful of abuse. My mother is on the lowest contact possible as when I begged her to let us borrow the car again for two days because I'd had some post operative complications and the costs I'd had to pay moving meant we had to dig into our own car savings, she asked me if she had to 'come over and wipe my ass for me,' which was kind of the straw that broke the camels back for me (she also deliberately broke a lot of my shit while we moved.) It's been coming for years, I'm sure she's narcissistic, but we don't have time to unpack all of that. She routinely does things like deliberately tell extended family she'll get my partner's Christmas present for kris-kringle and then 'forget' to do it so he's standing there feeling left out, for example (our family has a Santa who gives the gifts out one by one.) All kinds of that shit.

All of a sudden, because Easter is coming up, she's insisting my partner and I come over. Easter Sunday and Good Friday are public holidays here which means the pay is amazing, and as we've eaten through our savings following my surgery, we need to be financially responsible. They live pretty far away, too, so without a car we can't just go after or before work. It's a full day's travel by public transit and it's pretty expensive, so we'd realistically be missing on two days of work. 

And, honestly, I don't actually want to go if we don't have our own car because I don't like the idea of things going south while I'm there and being unable to get home. It's a hostile environment for me, I'd solely be going to see my dad and the dogs, and I don't want to be stuck there when my mother inevitably blows up or makes my partner upset with her nitpicking on me. My partner is so fed up with how my mother speaks to me that he's been pretty firm in not wanting to go, either (but he says if I decide to, he'll come with me to support me regardless.) We genuinely are working on Easter Sunday but at this stage we're free on Good Friday and that's when they're pushing us to come over now.

How do I tell my dad we aren't coming? Do I lie and say it's because of work and spend weeks dodging alternative dates they want me to come over? Do I be honest with him and say it's a hostile environment for me and I need space? I'm scared that no matter what, they'll either blow up at me and make it WORSE or my Dad will think I'm angry with him or something, but the idea of being in a room with my brother who fucking *hates* me and my mother makes me feel unwell from anxiety.  


Sorry, this has been very long, I'm just totally at a loss here.  


TL;DR: My mother is narcissistic and my brother and I aren't speaking after he tried to fleece me for gunpla money. The family environment is hostile and they're pressuring my partner and I to come over even though it's not really feasible or comfortable for us. How do I tell my dad I'm not planning on coming?"
50,"My bf [25M] masturbates in front of me [24F] to porn after we fight, despite it hurting me


My boyfriend and I have been together for over 3 years, living together for over 2 years. We're each other's first significant others. The relationship has been extremely serious for a long time (discussed marriage, knew we'd stay together), but also very difficult at times. Despite all that we've been through, we've claimed to love each other very deeply and would continue to love each other through thick and thin (e.g., extreme family opposition, lies, lack of career/education on his end for 3 years). 

He battled a porn addiction for 10 years before we got together and was Christian and said that he didn't support the porn industry/didn't want to use it while in this relationship with me. At the time, I was pretty indifferent about porn. But as our relationship got more serious, I realized I was actually hurt and uncomfortable by it, especially while we were living together because I have a high sex drive (we had sex daily for 2 years and then daily or multiple times a week depending on how busy we are; I have also never denied him sex and he CLAIMS that he's very satisfied with our sex life). I also told him that using porn made me feel less adequate (I don't and never have used porn btw). We communicated about this topic a lot and he also agreed that he didn't want to use it (mind you, I NEVER asked him to promise something he didn't want to promise, nor did either of us think it was realistic for him to promise such a thing). We mutually agreed that he would try not to use it (it aligns with his values), but whenever he would relapse, that he should be transparent about it with me. Then, I caught him lying about not using porn/racy pictures when he had, numerous times (he was not discreet at all in trying to hide it) - I was more upset the blatant lies than I was about how much the act itself hurt me. I forgave him time and time again, because he was always at least very sorry for lying. It got to a point, where I decided that rebuilding our trust was more important than my pain on this issue. We revisited our boundaries and agreed that it's okay for him to use porn while I am not home/around him, but only when I am home, he should refrain from doing it (especially because it hurts me so much). And if he MUST use it at home because he's that stressed out, he should talk to me about it. 

All this context brings us to the last few weeks where we've been fighting a lot. I keep trying to work things out and find compromises. Yesterday we had a fight that started from something really stupid (him making a comment about how strapless dresses wouldn't look good on me because I have small boobs/strapless dresses don't look good on all girls with small boobs, while I asked him opinions on dresses). I was offended by it, but I chose not to take it too personally, but I guess HE felt defensive when I said that I disagreed with his generalization about strapless dresses. The conversation escalated into an argument when I told him he was being defensive, in which case he told me I was being defensive. And then I said something along the lines of ""this is such a stupid topic to have an argument over, can we just agree to disagree?"" and then he completely dismissed me and started putting on his earphones to ignore me. This triggered me and we were in a full blown fight. After fighting, I apologized for ""lying about not being offended"" and apologized for raising my voice/acting inappropriately too. He didn't accept my apology but I thought things would be okay...

This morning, I was really trying to make things right and made food for him. As I called out to him about the food (we live in a studio and the kitchen is literally 5 steps away from our bed) and turned around, I saw that he was masturbating to porn on our bed... so blatantly. I was so shocked, basically in utter disbelief. He saw me and continued. I was so hurt by the fact that it violated what we had agreed on and he was continuing masturbating/watching knowing that it was hurting me so badly. And then he basically told me I was creepy and started getting mad at me for ""barging in on his privacy"". He told me (almost word for word) that he's allowed to make himself feel good by doing whatever he wants and he will continue to do whatever he wants, even if it hurts me, because at the end of the day, it's his choice and my choice to accept it or not. I get it on a literal sense, but I was just so shocked how he could be so mean and shameless. Even after he cooled down he told me he wasn't sorry at all for what he did to hurt me because there's nothing wrong with his behavior (not even the way he was yelling rudely at me). He admitted that it didn't feel good that I was hurting/crying, but he said that he shouldn't feel sorry at all.

I decided to bury that and then we had a 2 hour conversation on how we would move forward. He basically told me that we should be less serious, focus on ourselves, and aired out how he thinks I'm so selfish/emotionally dependent/fragile when I explained why his actions hurt me so much. Later on I, again, apologized for being selfish/fragile/etc. Only an hour after that conversation while I was eating dinner at my desk, he started masturbating to porn at his desk (which is directly next to mine). I was in utter disbelief again that he could do that to me AGAIN and not feel any remorse whatsoever. 

I know that a lot of people are really liberal about porn usage in their monogamous relationships, but is this behavior normal? 

I feel so incredibly hurt and disrespected.

TL;DR: Bf and I agreed that porn usage was inappropriate while the other is home (especially since we live in a small studio), but he violated that TWICE without remorse, by masturbating to porn directly in front of me."
51,"My friends and I (23f) will bail on parties if anyone in the group is uncomfortable. No questions asked. My boyfriend (25m) gets irritated every time.


.

Another time, my friends, me, Alex, and Rose's boyfriend went out barhopping and clubbing, and had fun at the first place we were at. But at the second, there was some guy who wouldn't leave Becca alone, so she decided to bail and we all followed her out. My boyfriend was arguing about it, saying ""why are you leaving"" again and again but not really being able to hear our answers over the music, and I finally said to him, ""We talk about that outside. Don't argue that here."" And we went outside to walk to another place. I told him on the walk that someone was bothering Becca so she decided to leave. And he should know that if he parties with us, if someone wants out of somewhere, you don't argue it. 

The last time, Alex invited me and my friends to a party hosted by someone we all know from college. This guy was on a certian sport team that we all heard rumors about in college. Rumors that said you really shouldn't party with that team. And even though we're all out of college, we figured that party might be a similar scene, and decided against going. I told my boyfriend why, and he thought it was ridiculous, that we were skipping out on something because of rumors... That weren't even specifically about the host, but just the organization he was a part of years ago. 

After that, I decided to have a serious talk with Alex. Saying that he might not understand all of our decisions, because he's not had to worry about the same stuff we have. But he should know that the way we handle partying has saved us a lot of trouble over the years. And it's kept stuff fun for us, we don't grin through parties that we're not comfortable at, we get out and go have actual fun. 

He said that on the other hand, it's rude to go out somewhere with your boyfriend then unilaterally decide to bail and go elsewhere. And also in his opinion, some of the people or groups we left because of were good guys. He thought it was bad communication to just have a ""leave with no questions asked"" policy when ever anyone so much as points at the door. And not communicate why until everyone had already left.

I felt like in that conversation, we were both getting defensive. Me of the way my friends and I make decisions about where to party, him about how trustworthy his friends and the crowds they hang with are.

I want some advice on how to keep this from being an issue going forwards. It hasn't been too frequent in the past, we go out every other weekend at least and it's only come up 3 times. But every time it does come up, it stresses me out.

tldr - my friends and I will bail on a party if any of us has a bad feeling about it, or doesn't feel safe. No questions asked. It annoys my boyfriend, which in turn frustrates me."
52,"I (27f) dating guys (20s and 30s) and want to know when should I mention my personal finance hobby or if I shouldn't at all?


Basically, personal finance is a major hobby of mine. Some people play sports or like video games, I nerd out over the stock market, budgeting, coupons, and saving to retire early pretty young (probably 40s or 50s). It is my far my favorite hobby, I read multiple blogs about it weekly and watch youtube videos. The only other major passions of mine that come close in comparison are history or fanfiction of my favorite fandoms. 

&amp;#x200B;

When I'm asked what my hobbies are when I'm talking to someone new, I get a mix of reactions and I've tried mentioning it at different points in a relationship. First off, I'm a woman. As shitty as it is, it's not really socially acceptable for women as it is for men to be into ""money stuff"". Plus I've very open about it when people ask me questions. What's my debt? No problem, how much do I make? No problem. I've worked hard to get my shit together and I'm not ashamed.

&amp;#x200B;

I find I usually need to hid my hobby or downplay it because it seems guys don't want to accept it. I had one relationship where I didn't mention it for two months. The guy made a very good living and came from an upper middle class family (I'm from a working class one) and money wasn't an object for him. I didn't want to seem like a golddigger and he just didn't seem interested in investments or anything. Well when I finally revealed my hobby to him it became a real source of contention because he wanted us to focus on his hobbies like football. I tried to watch it and be interested but I just am not a die hard fan and that's a large part about why our relationship ended. I've also been told my interest are ""cute"". I've only had one guy respond positively to it in a least a dozen first dates over the last two years to my hobby because he shared it too. He had other issues unfortunately so it didn't work out.

&amp;#x200B;

Basically this hobby stems from being so financially illiterate until a few years ago and I've dug myself out of 58k in student loans and a -55k net worth to a 46k net worth in less than four years. So is this something I need to keep quiet? Something it's ok to be vocal about in the beginning of a relationship? Or should I keep down playing it? I've just been saying ""I follow the stock market"" which is a more socially acceptable thing. 

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR - Should I be honest or downplay my biggest hobby, personal finance, when dating guys. I've tried both tactics and it usually doesn't go over well."
53,"I (24F) am dating a complainer (25M). His complaining is beginning to turn me off. How can I turn things around?


I’m dating a complainer. We’ve been together for 4 years.

Don’t get me wrong - he is perfect in every other way and I love him dearly. Whatever he’s struggling with, I am willing to support. However his threshold for stress is really low and it’s beginning to bother me.

I’ve spoken to him about it before, that his complaining was making it hard for me to get in the mood with him. I’m starting to feel like he’s irritating and whiny. He told me that I’m the only person that’s open to listening to him and supporting him. We both don’t have much friends and we only have each other. I don’t doubt for a second that he is my best friend, and I will ride (haha!) or die with this man.
After the talk, he said “I’ll share my feelings with you less often then.” We tried it and it was not a good idea, he was always sulking. When I asked him why he said “what!!! You told me not to tell you!!”

He would go like “argh work argh” “life sucks ugh” “why do I have to do taxes this is annoying” “grrr I missed the bus” “sigh why is life so difficult” “argh I can’t rest” “this is so stressful” “I hate everything”  - There’s something to complain about every day, at every moment when things don’t go his way. 

It would be absolutely fine if it wasn’t affecting my sexual attraction towards him. He’s a physically attractive man and he’s ok in bed. But the moment he starts to complain about how tired and exhausted he is, I absolutely am not in the mood to have sex. I still go through the motions, but I feel really guilty about this. 

I guess I wish he was stronger when it came to his stress threshold. It can be tiring for me too. He says he does not want to go for therapy because he can’t be away from work too much. 

I’m really at a loss and it feels like such a trivial matter to break up over. 

How should I go about resolving this? 

TLDR: Bf is complaining all the time and I want to continue being supportive, but it’s starting to become really annoying to the point where I can’t have sex with him. I don’t know how to move forward from here. I need advice."
54,"I[24M] recently bought the mother of my child[23F] a car with my life savings. She broke up with me unexpectedly today.


We have had a good relationship for over three years. We hit a rough spot half a year ago. I didn't think it would work out, I was willing to get my own apartment. She convinced me to stay and I thought things have been going great since. 

Two weeks ago I decided to buy her a car to help with the kids and errands. She was ecstatic, squeezed me really tight and told me how wonderful I was. Since then we haven't had any arguments or issues(so I thought). I have poured my heart and soul out to this woman, we fell in love and started a family. She is unlike anyone I have ever met, her and our child are my world

This morning she woke me up and promptly broke up with me before I even got out of bed. I had a major breakdown, I asked her why this was happening and where we went wrong. What could we do to fix this. All I got in return was silence, then a request to leave her house by the end of the day with virtually nothing to my name. Now I'm sitting here in tears suddenly having to figure out what to do with my life.

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR: Kicked out of family household, almost nothing to my name. What should I do?"
55,"My flatmate (22/m) is following me (23/f) and I dont know how to tell him to stop without causing drama


TDLR: Moved in a dorm room with very poor sound isolation, my flatmate can hear every move that I make. He exits the room every time I exit, watches me from the window, follows me when I go outside. Jokes about being a creeper, got defensive when I tried to confront him. Help. How do I tell him to stop but in a way that wont make the future months awkward for living?

I moved into my dorm room one month ago and the room next to me is a guy that is a creep. Let me explain.
At first I really liked him, he was a flatmate that I could easily talk to, he was funny, helpful... I was actually relieved that I have a nice flatmate. Until I started noticing that he follows me. 

So our walls in our flat are really thin, you can hear EVERYTHING (I can hear keyboard from other flatmate's room). Also you can always hear when somebody (there is 7 of us in the flat) is leaving their room and entering the kitchen. And I started noticing that everytime I go to the kitchen my flatmate magically comes in and pretends to do something. He comes with water bottle and fills it up even though he can fill it up in his room cause every room has its bathroom. This.happenes.every.time. And if I exit my room and dont go to the kitchen but outside I can hear him exiting his room and going to the kitchen to watch me from there cause the kitchen window is on the side of the building entrance. I can fucking see him there on the window!! He texts me 0-24h, sends memes, gifs, talks how he wants to hug me, how I am such a nice and sweet girl, how one day he wishes that he has a wife and a daughter just like me. I always say thank you to that and one time he asked me ""but would you like to have a son like me"" EXCUSE ME WHAT???? I try not to text him, but he just keeps sending messages, if I dont reply for a long time he knocks on my door and tells me something not important.

Every morning when we are in the kitchen he asks me about my plans for that day, when I tell him briefly like I have to go to University or something he literally waites in his room for me to go and when I exit my room, he exits in the same time and says he is going for a walk, guess where? In the direction of my uni. 

Today he asked me to go for a walk and I said that I cant go because I have to go to the Uni and I didnt tell him when I was going cause I know he would exit the flat in the same time. I guess he waited for me to exit because as soon as I exited my room he exited his fully dressed with keys and wallet. What I did then is I just got back in my room. I listened then what he was doing. So i heard him just standing in the hallway probably confused, then he went to the kitchen but I was still in my room waiting for him to leave because if he is going somewhere he will leave right?? Then he left. Luckily! Or is it? So I waited a little bit more and in the meantime I texted my bf that I have to go to the uni and that I will call him and talk to him if this psycho starts to follow me. I exited the flat and started looking around to see if he is somewhere there and guess who just magically appeared. He was hiding behind the building. I was so angry. I just called my bf and talked to him the whole time until I came to my destination, and he was just awkwardly walking near me.

Yesterday morning he saw me going to the store from the kitchen and can you guess who magically entered the store 5 min after me? My fricking flatmate. I watched him carefully and I saw him just going around the store and looking at me, waiting for me to go to the cashier so he can also go. After I paid for my grocieries I exited the store so fast and started walking towards my room. And I usually walk really fast. Guess who started running to catch up with me. My.fricking.flatmate. Then I went to the gym without telling him, and the way to the gym is 10 minutes walk across green area, its not on the main road, so only pedestrians are there. And this is the way that only leads to the sports centre, nowhere else. And he doesnt go to the gym! Anyway I was walking and I kind of looked behind me, cause I always like to be cautious. Guess who I saw walking in the distance. I wasnt sure it was him so I kept looking. After I was 100% sure it was him I just stopped, stood there and looked at him from the distance with my angriest look. He probably couldnt see my face but it worked cause when he noticed that I can see him, he just turned around, started running and hide in the bushes. And then he sent me a message something like he thinks he saw me, but he isnt sure if he imagined it. And I told him to stop following me, and that I am serious (because before that I jokingly tried to tell him that he is a stalker, but he just owned it and he started joking about going to the kitchen every time he hears me). Anyway he got defensive and mad for me thinking he is following me, he told me some excuse how he was going somewhere and told me that I am full of myself. Like if you werent following me why did you run away and hide from me? 

He also brags to me how he dumped his ex girlfriend and then he fakes conversation with her on the phone. He likes to enter the kitchen when I am there and pretend that he is on his phone and he usually says something like this to his ex: dude stop calling me, I broke up with you, you are too in love with me, you need to move on. But how do I know that he is talking to himself? His native language is not english so it doesnt make sense to speak in english with someone who has the same native language and lives in that country. I can always hear the person on his phone when he is talking for real, but I cant hear anything when he has this convos with his ex. And I saw his screen once and saw there is no call.

Also he is aware that I have a bf. I told him that he is going to visit me soon. And then he asked me does my bf have big muscles because he doesnt want to be beaten up for flirting with me?? Like I will beat you up, it doesnt have to be him.

He calls himself a nice guy but he has zero respect for other people's relationships. I would like to ask him ""hey flatmate, if I was your girl, would you think that is ok that somebody else talks to me and acts with me like you do"" cause clearly the answer is NO. 

Oh yeah. I thought I had like only few months left with him, cause I am going back to my country but guess who searched online for companies in my country and in MY TOWN for internship. My country is not a developed country for his field of studies, you will never hear somebody go there especially if they dont know the language, so that doesnt make sense for him to go. He said he wrote an email to several companies and now he is waiting. Great.

Now it's like I am living in hell. I try to exit my room as quietly as I can but there is no way cause the doors are just too loud. I dont have money to eat in restaurants so I really need to cook in the kitchen but I cant describe how anxious I am when I have to go there cause I know that he will come as soon as he hears me. I cant exit the building without feeling like I am watched or followed. So that means I am constantly under stress, looking around and I cant relax.

Anyone knows how can I approach this topic with him? He got defensive and accused me when I said it seriously but he jokes when I jokingly mention him stakling me. I dont want to cause any drama in the flat. I just want him to act like he acted before having a crush. We talked normally in the kitchen before, no boundaries were crossed. The problem is he gets excited when I say something that matches with his views and then he starts to follow me. I started to talks bullshit cause I was thinking there is no way he could like this, but it didnt work.

Also there is no way I can change flat. I am an exchange student that came one month ago to the Uni. They barely found the room for me cause I came in wierd term time and I already paid everything (I had to).

I was hoping maybe he will leave me alone after he meets my bf when he comes for visit. But he wont be in the flat when my bf comes.

And I am not scared for my security, if you were wondering. I am pretty strong girl (definetly stronger then him, he is really thin), I did boxing for couple of years and I know I could easily beat him up if he ever tries to do something. 

I also want to say that he is really nice to everybody, he is helpful, cares for people etc. To me it seems like he has his dream world and he doesnt know how to not be creepy. I feel like he does all of this because he thinks we will spend more time together and fall in love. It doesnt seem like he has any motive to do anything bad. But I am really done with his behaviour and I am angry because I cant relax.

I just want to know how to nicely tell him to leave me alone. Because if I dont tell him to gtfo I know I will explode and it will just end up like a disaster. Help."
56,"Is it ok that I’m [20f] making my new bf [19m] of 1 month wait before we have sex?


I feel really bad, we planned to do it today but I guess I freaked out on him and said I wanted to wait. We got to the point where we were making out naked and he had a condom on but I wasn’t wet enough because I was too nervous. It’s not like he can’t get me wet, last time we hung out I was the most turned on I’ve ever been (lol weird flex but ok). We did do everything else besides sex and ik this is TMI but he came on my stomach so it’s not like I blue balled him haha. Anyway I kept apologising and he kept telling me to stop saying sorry because it’s not something I should apologise for. We started officially going out around two weeks ago. Is it weird that we haven’t had sex yet? I’m so used to everything moving extremely fast with my previous boyfriends. But all of my first times with them were kinda shit cause I wasn’t wet enough so I’m trying to convince myself that it’s a good thing we didn’t do it today. I’m still kinda paranoid he’s only dating me to get in my pants cause I said I only have sex with people I’m in a relationship with but he keeps reassuring me that he really likes me. Idk I have a lot of self esteem issues like I don’t want him to see me completely naked because I lost a lot of weight recently, which is probably a problem I need to work on myself. Anyway I guess I’m either looking for reassurance or people to tell me if I am being a prude to wait so long. Thanks in advance :)

tl;dr: Me and my boyfriend have been officially dating for 2 weeks and I wanted to know if it’s normal to not have sex yet?"
57,"My dad (51M) is not happy with my decision to get my (18M) own bank account


So the way that it works currently is that my parents pay for my insurance and pay about half of car repairs and whatnot. I have about 4 grand saved up in my bank account that my dad helped me start about a year and a half ago. I’ll be 18 in 2 days and one of the first things I wanted to do is open my own bank account, separate from parental control. Right now, my dad has access to my bank account, and could take out any amount he chooses. I love my dad, and I find it incredibly unlikely that he’d ever drain my account should anything arise, but I still want my own bank account. 


I told him of my plans and he is not happy to say the least, he basically told me he’s hurt that I wouldn’t trust him enough to let him have access to my bank account, and that I’m paranoid if I think he’ll take any money. I love him, and I think I understand how he feels, but I still want my own account. I don’t want this to turn into a trust issue, but the only person I want controlling my finances is me. What should I tell him? 



TLDR: I’ll be 18 in two days, I wanna open my own bank account separate from parental control. My dad thinks this is some sort of breach of trust and is not happy with me"
58,"My wife (30F) gave birth to a baby that is not mine (30M). She refuses to consent to a paternity test and has fled with the baby.


A throwaway.

&amp;#x200B;

My wife gave birth to her first child a few days ago.  Notice how I said ""her"", not ""our"".  To be very blunt: My wife and I are white.  The baby is black.  There is literally no way the child can be mine.  No racism is intended here, it is simply a statement of fact.  I left the hospital without signing the birth certificate and the hospital staff was a real bunch of pricks about me not signing it for the most part, but they eventually let me go when I started showing pictures of the child.

&amp;#x200B;

My wife vehemently denies any adultery and said repeatedly how she has absolutely no idea how this happened.  I think I have a pretty good idea of how it happened, but she says she absolutely can't believe that I would accuse her of such a thing, blah blah blah.  I told her if I have nothing to fear that she would have no problem agreeing to a paternity test, but she absolutely refuses to go along with this.  She said she thinks it's ""an invasion of privacy"" and that she just plain can't believe that I would want to back out of my responsibilities raising ""our"" daughter!  We went back and forth on this for a while and she eventually decided that she is ""concerned that I will hurt the baby"" and that she needs to go to her mother's house for a while.  For the record, I have absolutely no intention of harming anything other than a bottle of Jack Daniels, and the only threat I made was when I threatened to go to the courts and request an order for a paternity test.  But regardless, she ran off yesterday with the baby.  She will not answer her phone.  I have no idea where she is, who she is talking to, what she is saying, or if she's ever coming back.

&amp;#x200B;

There is no way I am staying with my darling wife at this point.  Even if the cheating weren't enough, even somehow if the lies and deceit weren't enough, the doubling down on the lies and deceit plus the humiliation I had when I was delivered a baby that clearly wasn't mine (right in front my parents and her mother!) is way over the line of things I am willing to tolerate.  But as she's made clear multiple times, I was married to her at the time the baby was born so in the eyes of the law, I am legally the baby's father, regardless of whether or not I signed the birth certificate.  While I want the best for the little girl who is an innocent victim in this whole mess and doesn't even know it, I do not want to be on the hook having to make payments to support a child that is absolutely not mine.  But if she and the baby are not around, I have no means of proving that I am not the girl's father.  What the hell am I supposed to do?

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR: My wife gave birth to a child that absolutely isn't mine.  She denies cheating but refuses to have a paternity test, ran off with the child so I cannot have one done behind her back, and seems to want me to be on the hook to support a child that is not mine."
59,"My family is extremely overprotective of me [22 F] and won't let me go anywhere alone - even tagging along business trips.


Background: I was home schooled and extremely shielded during my childhood. My mom is ill and my siblings have an age gap of 10+ years, so they take on the role of ""second parents"". I'm also almost deaf, so they worry about me ""not being able to hear"" if someone ""tries to kidnap me"" (their words) or something happens.

Ever since I graduated highschool I've been trying to reclaim the teenage years I lost due to being homeschooled. I never had friends or left the house. So I'm trying to go out more. Whenever I want to go out, my family flat out refuses or tags along. This is especially awkward during dates and has led to me having to break off relationships.

Recently, I started a new job in marketing, which will require a lot of travel. I'm letting my sister (35 F) and her husband (36 M) tag along my first trip to Vegas. However, they're insistent on making plans to come with me to every trip, even to Chicago. We're in SoCal.

My family is fairly poor and can't afford this. My company pays my tickets of course - but they want to take time off work and pay extra just to come with me. I told them that once they meet my co-workers, I'm sure they'll feel more secure about letting me go on trips - but they aren't listening and are starting to make plans to come.

It's a embarrassing at work. And my family is acting like I'm being the burden for even getting this job because now ""they have to come along"".

I don't know what to do at this point. I understand they're worried due to me being sheltered all my life but this is stressing me out. I finally landed my dream job and they're complaining about it. I pay rent, manage my own bills, and am fairly independent - but they still treat me like a child. It's also frustrating when it impacts relationships.

Any advice?

TLDR Overbearing family won't let me go on business trips alone, or hardly anywhere alone. I'm 22 and it's ruining my relationships and work."
60,"I (30f) am considering breaking up with him (34m) over oral.


I'm just so confused.

&amp;#x200B;

We've been together 3 years. In those years, he's never once given me oral. I've talked about it outside the bedroom before, and he just can't give me a straight answer. I give him oral nearly every time. His strange behavior made me feel uncomfortable asking for it in the middle of sex, so I've just gotten used to not having it. I assumed he was insecure about his abilities or didn't like it.

&amp;#x200B;

Well, now I find out he's done it with all his previous girlfriends. It's a long explanation as to how I know, but basically he was laughing about a video he had made with an exgirlfriend where she filmed him giving her oral. He said they videotaped each other a lot, and we should try it (in our conversation this discussion made sense). I stopped him and asked him ""you went down on her??""  

&amp;#x200B;

He became uncomfortable and after I insisted on knowing more he admitted he went down on her all the time. And everyone else. Apparently I'm the only one he's never gone down on.

&amp;#x200B;

I asked him why. He was extremely uncomfortable and said he doesn't want to have this conversation, that I don't want to know, etc etc.  My stomach dropped because I couldn't imagine what he would say. I know it's not hygiene. I'm a shower and bathe everyday person. In fact, I almost always have just showered/bathed before sex. I don't have any infections (I go for physicals yearly). No unusual discharge. I'm smooth. But most importantly, my previous partners have been happy to do it and never complained, and since he's never even done it he wouldn't know if I were unclean anyway.

&amp;#x200B;

I had been thinking he had a bad experience previously, but obviously not if he did it all the time and I'm the only person he hasn't done it with during our entire relationship.

&amp;#x200B;

It was odd. He was extremely uncomfortable and obviously didn't want to tell me. I tried to guess...hygiene? He shook his head no and said it was nothing like that.

&amp;#x200B;

Now I'm scared I really DON'T want to know. Is my vagina that unusual compared to his other girlfriends?  I feel like an unappealing freak now. I didn't push it, and he didn't bring it up again. But how on earth can I continue a relationship with someone who has a deep dark secret about my vagina?? And maybe I don't want to know. Maybe he will destroy my self esteem. I'm considering breaking up our 3 year relationship over this. Is that stupid??

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR: Boyfriend has never given me oral and I recently found out he has given every other partner oral. Asked him why and he says I don't want to know. I am thinking it's time to break up."
61,"Is it okay for me [19] to be upset with my friend [17] for wearing my clothes and sleeping with her boyfriend at his place?


So sometimes I sleep at my friends dorm so that I don't have to commute to and from my classes everyday (about a 35 minute commute). Because of this, I leave some of my clothes at her dorm. 

Sometimes I'd see her around campus wearing one of my shirts or a jacket and I never really cared that much. 

About two weeks ago, I had left my boyfriend's \[22\] jacket at her dorm and I saw her wearing it out. I had told her that I didn't want her wearing the jacket since it wasn't mine but it was okay to for the rest of the day. She told me she had understood and that she wouldn't wear it anymore after that. 

A few hours ago (around 2:30AM), she had sent me a SnapChat of her sleeping with her shirtless boyfriend wearing my t-shirt and my boyfriend's jacket.

I texted her asking if it was my boyfriend's jacket and her reply was ""lol my bad."" I told her I didn't like how she was with her boyfriend wearing my clothes and sleeping together. She told me I shouldn't be mad because they didn't have sex and only teased each other. I told my boyfriend about it and he said he doesn't really want the jacket anymore because he felt weird about it.

She's now annoyed at me because she said it wasn't a big deal and told me I was being mad for something so small.

How should I go on about this situation?  Should I confront about the situation again? I know it is partly my fault for leaving some of my clothes at her dorm, but I don't understand why she chooses to wear my clothes when she has so much of her own.

She has also stained some of my clothes with ramen broth and has never cleaned it off since. I just don't know how to explain how upset I am to her to get it to her head. Any advice?

TDLR: Friend wears my clothes sometimes and wore my t-shirt and boyfriend's jacket (which i politely asked her not to wear) to sleep with her boyfriend"
62,"I believe that my sister (26F) is about to announce something big to my (30F) family and I want to be happy for her but it will be difficult.


My sister (26F) and her husband (26?M) have been married 4 years at this point. She told me about 6 or so months ago that they were going to start trying to have a baby, which I was excited about as I have also been trying with my husband (34M) for some time. We've been married 6 years and I stopped taking birth control in February of 2014, but we are yet to get pregnant.

Yesterday, my sister texted me (she lives on the other side of the country with her husband who is in the military) and asked when I would be seeing our parents next (I live in the same state as our parents about 2 hours away). I said I would see them on Easter most likely, and she said she wants to have a Skype or Facetime call with all of us. She usually only does this on holidays, so I'm assuming it's because she wants to announce her pregnancy (or possibly other big news, but I know they aren't moving back around this area for some time) to the family. 

I love my sister so much and I am so proud of her and her accomplishments, and I absolutely adore her husband, but I am afraid that I will react the wrong way when/if she tells us. I am heartbroken that my husband and I have been unable to have a baby in these past 5 years, and my parents have even asked when we are going to have children. I'd love to adopt or foster a child, but my husband was adopted as a baby so he's really gung-ho on having a biological child. 

If my sister is indeed pregnant, how can I make it so I react appropriately? I want to be happy for her and I am, but I don't want to ruin anything by being jealous either. I have friends and other distant relatives with children but her child would be the first grandchild for our parents, and I always assumed that I would be providing their first grandchild as I am the oldest and got married first. 

I know life happens and if she is indeed pregnant I want to be and will be happy for her, but I don't want my sadness to show. Any recommendations on what I should do? 

**TL;DR: My sister may be announcing her pregnancy to our family this weekend and I always thought that I would be the first to get pregnant. How can I get over my disappointment in my own situation and be happy for my sister and not ruin her special moment?**"
63,"My [39f] husband [40m] is a grumpy curmudgeon and it’s killing our relationship.


I am so sick of my husband right now. We got married young, mostly because I was trying to find someone who’d be OK with my very strict, immigrant family. I was young and I didn’t realize that I should have made decisions based on my own happiness instead of my family’s.

We’ve had our ups and downs, and I know I haven’t been perfect either. But I’m trying. I’m always trying. At the end of the day, I cannot stand him. He is grumpy and cranky. He gets stressed over the smallest things and isn’t pleasant. He’s just a miserable person. I’ve tried to get to the root of whatever his problem is, and he always says he’s neither grumpy nor miserable. This is with always with me, and occasionally with others. (I feel like a lot of his day is spent holding in his miserable attitude) I have asked him time and time again what I can do to fix his mood, help him out, ask him what I’ve done wrong, etc. there is never a clear answer and he will nearly always say he’s totally fine.   Eventually it causes me to either blow up at him, or blow up internally.  Every few days I am either crying myself to sleep or seeping with anger towards him. 

He is a good father to our two kids (3&amp;6), he plays with them, he’s kind to them and loves them very much.

I’ve tried repeatedly to get him to go to marital counseling but he won’t. I’ve had thoughts of divorce, but to me, I feel like divorce is for things like cheating, abuse, and BIG things. We don’t have big things. No one is cheating. No one is abusive. I just can’t stand him. I can’t stand his surly attitude, I can’t stand that he has a puss on his face all the time, but I also can’t stand the idea of breaking up a home. Most importantly, I can’t stand that I’m constantly trying to be nice and getting nothing in return.

My oldest child is a very fragile, sensitive kid. I know that divorce would be absolutely brutal for him. He loves his father to pieces. Our younger one, even though only 3, is clearly more resilient and would likely be fine even if a tornado hit above his head.

I can’t fathom getting divorced for my own happiness when nothing is tragically wrong. Moving out of our house (Neither one of us would be able to afford it alone), splitting up my family, shuffling kids to different houses, and living single mom life sounds equally miserable.

Has anyone else been in this situation? Been the product of this situation?

TL;DR  I’m starting to despise my husbands nasty attitude, he won’t go for counseling and I’m not sure this is grounds to divorce and break up a family."
64,"Boyfriend (35m) and his daughter (6m) moved into my (26f) apartment. Boyfriend isn't being a nice neighbor



it all, both to me, which is annoying because the building is what it is. And to the landlord, which I figure isn't going to lead to any changes.

The neighbors to one side have their living room adjoining our hallway, and I can hear what they have on TV or what they're talking about if I am in that hallway. It's no big deal to me, it's not like I hang out in the hallway. But Jason actually talked to these neighbors about not putting on R rated shows on their TV because his daughter can hear through the wall. I thought that was kind of an overstep, telling people what to watch in their own home.

The neighbor diagonal to our unit has apparently had sex with some guy loud enough to be audible from our kitchen, and Jason wants to tell her to be quieter because he doesn't want his daughter hearing that. That was crossing a line to me, you don't just go up to the apartment of a girl who lives alone and talk to her about how you hear her sex noises... I told him not to do it but IDK if he will listen.

There are a couple more things but this post is getting long enough already. I don't know how to get my boyfriend to chill out about the neighbors. I'm annoyed he's being such a busybody, in my opinion you just have to deal with ambient noise if you live in a cheap apartment in a big city. I'm also worried that if all our neighbors get annoyed with us, they'll be less forgiving when we are occasionally noisy. Like Emily threw a fit about something a few days ago, and one of our neighbors banged on the wall, and yelled to ""Keep it in check"" which I think is exactly what Jason goes around saying to other people. So it seems like people are getting annoyed enough to throw it back at him, which is stressing me out. 

Any advice?

tldr - My boyfriend is living with me now, along with his daughter. He's becoming the busybody neighbor, too strict about noise. Unreasonably strict, I think. And it's causing tension in our apartment building."
65,"I (28F) found out that my best guy friend (27M) cheated on his longtime girlfriend and now has a baby with his mistress. He doesn't know I know. Should I say something?


I've been friends with Alex for 18 years; our moms are best friends and we grew up together. He was a ""bridesman"" in my wedding, and him, his girlfriend Megan of 5 years, my husband and I have hung out a lot. Recently, my mom called me up to dish some drama with me and hoooooly crap. 

Apparently, his mom and my mom were hanging out and his mom started crying and said she just couldn't hide it anymore. She began showing my mom baby pictures of her GRANDSON. The whole truth came out and apparently he had been cheating on his girlfriend for over a year and got his side chick pregnant. The baby was born 5 months ago, and he revealed that he was going to be a father to his family 2 weeks before the delivery date. His mom was devastated that it happened this way, and the family is keeping the baby a secret from the world to respect his girlfriend Megan and not make her feel bad. She found out about the affair 2 months before the baby was born and decided to stay (for some reason). Now, his mom shares all of the baby pictures with my mom and wants my mom to meet him. 

Well, I know this now and I'm absolutely shocked. Alex and Megan always seemed like they had a happy relationship! We even hung out with them right before the baby was apparently born! I thought he was a good guy. WTF. I just don't know if I should say anything? I have noticed Alex is a lot more quiet now and barely talks to anyone, hell sometimes I have a hard time getting a hold of him. What, if anything, do I do?? 

Tldr: best guy friend cheated on his longtime girlfriend, had a baby with the mistress. His mom told my mom, who told me. I'm wondering if I should say anything or just keep my knowledge to myself."
66,"I [27M] just had an interview, and my girlfriend [29F] sent me a text saying ""I just don't like you"". I think I'm tired of being the more mature one.


So... throwaway because honestly this is embarrassing, and also because I'm still annoyed and angry at this.

&amp;#x200B;

**Backstory**

First, a bit of backstory. My girlfriend (let's call her Alice) and I have been dating just less than a year, and she works in the same office as I currently do.

&amp;#x200B;

Since I've known her, she and her team have complained about their boss. He's an awful human being and treats people like they're disposable. Now, I have a lot of sympathy for that. Alice has a fairly terrible father, and has some health problems, for which she flew out for a month to another country to try to find some homeopathy treatments.

&amp;#x200B;

We've spoken about these issues more times than I can count. With the job situation, we spent a long time trying to study together (since we work in similar fields) and I thought it might be a nice way to bond with each other. Back in December, she was trying to push her way out of her current career into something totally different, and I told her that might not be the most realistic solution, since moving into something entirely new might take more than just a few months of effort. She said I was unsupportive and selfish (since I was also at the time really missing her company and wanted to hang out with her).

&amp;#x200B;

With regards to the home situation, I've told her to move out with a friend or to rent somewhere, but she says that's a waste of money. I told her that the peace of mind she'll get will be worth the money on rent, but she refuses.

&amp;#x200B;

**What happened a day ago**

Now it just so happens that I've been interviewing too, since I've grown disheveled at our company and I can't be here while I'm still young and ambitious. I had an interview on Wednesday that went pretty well. Girlfriend called me in the evening because she'd had a pretty bad day thanks to her boss, and she started off talking about how terrible this was. This is a regular occurrence since her boss is god awful, so I'm there to listen and provide input where necessary.

&amp;#x200B;

She then asked, ""hey, how'd your interview go?"", so I told her that it seemed to go quite well. I then told her I needed to go wash up, and suggested she go to bed early since it's been quite a stressful day.

&amp;#x200B;

She then texted me almost immediately to say, ""I just don't like you"", which left me FUMING. It's such a passive aggressive ploy for attention. I know we've not really hung out recently but that's down to a combination of feeling guilty for taking her time away from work/studying/whatever else, and because of how on and off I feel about her. Recently though, I've just been valuing my own time, so I'm pretty sure this text was just attention seeking.

&amp;#x200B;

But it's just *SO IMMATURE.* How on earth can I be thinking about this girl as long term material when we can't even have a productive conversation about feelings? I've talked to her so often about how we should talk through our emotions and not come back with petty outbursts, but here we are.

&amp;#x200B;

I pressed her for more information and she said she was pissed that *she* had to call *me* to ask how *my interview went.* Sorry, are we really discussing this? So she hasn't bothered to text me back and I haven't bothered to text her either.

&amp;#x200B;

... am I the asshole here, or what? I want to bring this up maturely but honestly I'm starting to think she just can't have that sort of conversation. I feel scared of bringing up anything contentious...

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR: Immature reaction from GF, and now we're not talking and I'm tired of always being the bigger person. Is this normal?"
67,"Coworker (25) adopted me (26) as a friend and I don't really like her


Let me first start off by saying I don't really have any friends. And by that I mean, I have one friend that is moving away soon so that will leave me with my friend from work as my only friend. I lost all my friends after high school. This was due to a combination of different lifestyles (I'm not into drugs or drinking), different politics (they were way too extreme), and religion (I grew up mormon and left at 16, lost all church friends). So I'm essentially friendless now. I am very shy and horrible at making conversation. I never know what to talk about because I guess I don't really have any experiences. I am truly boring. I don't mean to put myself down, but I really don't do much of anything outside of work except watch movies and do schoolwork. Anyways, let's get to the part about my coworker. 
  
We will call her Jane. Jane is a social butterfly. She will talk your ear off. She had no friends when she started at my job. I always ate lunch alone and she asked me to eat lunch with her, so I said yes. Ever since, we always eat lunch together and if I say no, I know it makes her a bit sad. She started calling me her friend and how she was so happy that we're so much alike. At this point I was stuck.
  
Jane is... annoying. She gets in moods where she is very rude and condescending to other people. She is very childish about things (she complains about her mom doing her laundry wrong). And worst of all, she is extremely overdramatic/hypochondriac, complaining about all her ""allergies"" (MSG, sulfates, nitrates, smoke, etc.) when she hasn't even gone to the doctor to actually confirm that she is truly allergic (I think it's a combination of irritants and stuff she knows is bad for you, but she truly thinks she is allergic to them and has an inhaler if she gets a reaction). I don't like this type of person, yet she is all I have. We do have some good conversations,  mostly about common interests and venting about work, but other than that I really can't stand her. 
  
So I guess my question is, am I a horrible person for going along with this ""friendship""? It is the only friendship I have, and obviously I crave that bond and connection with someone, no matter how much I can't stand it.  Also I don't really know how to go about making friends at this age. I don't know how to approach people and get them interested in me when I'm just not interesting. 

Tl;dr I'm probably a shitty person for going along with a fake friendship"
68,"My wife (25F) left me (24M) last night. Is it bad I’m not upset about it?


We were married for three years. She has bipolar disorder but never consistently took her medication or saw a therapist. 

When she put her hands on me, I knew changes needed to be made. She hit me, then tried to cut herself. I called the police and they took her to the hospital. 

She came home the next day and I told her she had to go to her mothers, at least until we could figure everything out. For three years she abused me, mentally and emotionally. When it became physical, I couldn’t handle it anymore. 

I told her that I wanted to make it work but she had to carry her end of the relationship.  Basically just take care of herself. She stopped going to school, and was going to take a job with a $4 an hour pay cut because it “feels more welcoming”. I understand that, but when we already struggle as is, I couldn’t understand it. 

So we tried to make it work. It lasted less than a week. She tried every trick she could to let me let her come back home. But I just couldn’t put up with the abuse anymore. Call me selfish, a jerk or whatever. I finally started standing up for myself, and she couldn’t handle it. 

She told me last night she “couldn’t do it” anymore. I told her when she started taking her medication consistently, saw a therapist consistently, and made some positive changes to how she treated me she could come home. 

I told her all of this. But I also told her it would take time. Apparently she doesn’t have the time. She’s gone for good now. And tbh I’m not even that upset about it. 

Maybe it just hasn’t hit me yet I’m not sure. Is it bad I’m feeling this way? And did I handle this the wrong way?

TL;DR: wife left me after three years of not handling her bipolar. She abused me the whole time and when I told her we couldn’t be together until she got it under control she left. I tried for three years to help her. But she wouldn’t help herself. Is it bad I don’t feel bad it’s over?"
69,"My (23f) sister (30f) and her husband (27m) have decided not to vaccinate their son (1m). I’m at a loss.


Throwaway for my family’s privacy. This will be long and I’m on mobile, sorry in advance. 

My sister and I grew up very close, literally best friends despite our age difference. We used to talk on the phone for hours every day, text constantly, and see each other as much as we could (we live in different states). I was the first person she called when she found out she was pregnant, and I was ecstatic. 

However, when they had their son they decided not to vaccinate him. The only reason I know this is because I was in a doctor’s appointment when they told their son’s doctor. They made a point to keep it a secret from everyone as they knew we would not approve. 

In the year or so since he has been born, I’ve been very conflicted. I love my sister, but honestly I am extremely liberal and I feel extremely strongly about vaccinating children. As my nephew was the only baby in the family I tried to put it out of my mind, at least for the time being. I did inform our parents and some cousins with children that they are not vaccinating my nephew, but no one has said anything to them expect for me. 

Here’s where it gets tricky for me. We now have a new baby in the family, and the new baby will be vaccinated. New baby will be interacting with my nephew, and honestly this makes me so worried. New baby’s parents are informed that my nephew is not vaccinated and they are not worried. 

I know when I have my own children, I will not want my nephew or any of my sister’s kids around my children until they are fully vaccinated, which takes years. Now that there’s a new baby in the picture, their actions are starting to affect others and not just themselves. 

I’m at a loss of what to do. I love my sister, so it’s not feasible for me to just cut her out of my life. Recently she has been posting anti-vax stuff on Facebook (I always thought it was just my brother-in-law). They both know my views on this and I have explicitly told her that her kids will not be around my kids until they are vaccinated. 

What am I supposed to do here? Try to have a discussion with them about it? That’s all I can think to do and I’m not sure if I could change their minds. My sister and I have gone from talking constantly to maybe twice a month. It’s really putting a strain on our relationship. Thanks for any advice. 

TL;DR My sister and I used to be best friends, but she isn’t vaccinating her son. Other babies are starting to be born in the family and I don’t know how to stand firm in my beliefs without cutting her out of my life."
70,"My (24f) boyfriend (29M) essentially called my bluff by ending the relationship when I didn't reply to his messages. When I accepted his decision, he backtracked and blames me for the situation we are in. Unsure how to proceed


Hi reddit, I’ve been dating my boyfriend for over a year now and generally things are very good. 

I still live with my mother, and unfortunately, over the past couple of months we have had two deaths of elderly relatives in our family. Our extended family is slightly dysfunctional, and these relatives were the ones hosting family get togethers and generally keeping everyone in contact. Sadly, rather than coming together there have been huge arguments, physical fights and lots of ugliness surrounding things like the will, the funeral arrangements and inheritance. Neither relative has any substantial kind of money, which almost makes it sadder that people are being greedy and fighting the way they are. On top of all of this, one relative has also made some very serious sexual allegations about another male family member involving younger relatives that have had police involvement. 

My mother and I are each grieving and are stressed and upset about this whole situation. My mother is the mentally strongest person I know, and she has been worn down by this whole event. The family deaths have also had more of an impact of her emotionally than they have on me, so I have been trying to be her support at this time. She has had some time away from work and I’ve been picking up more jobs than normal around the house and spending more quality time together. As a result, the amount I normally see and talk to my boyfriend has subsequently reduced. Not without reasonable explanation however.

My boyfriend and I have a very open, communicative relationship. I have told him everything that is going on – bar the abuse allegations. Not only is this a very unpleasant topic to discuss but my mother has asked me to not discuss this with anyone – boyfriend included. Boyfriend has been complaining about the amount of time I have been spending with my mother and asking when things can ‘go back to normal’ which I find incredibly rude. He doesn’t understand why this has taken as much of a toll as it has on my mother, implying she is overreacting. I personally think her reaction is completely justified even without the added stress of police interviews and drama which he obviously doesn’t know about. 

Something that stuck out to me as a ‘red flag’ was after turning down his offer of a weekend staying at his, he turned up uninvited to my house to ‘make sure I wasn’t doing anything I shouldn’t be’ and to check that I was just at home with my mum like I said. He again expressed confusion why I am being there for her as much as I am - to the point where I even begin to question how much time I am spending with my mum. For the record, I work 12 hr shifts so we really don’t see each other often over a week.

Around a week ago the whole situation blew up when I didn’t charge my phone and consequently didn’t message him until the next day. I had over 20 messages to go through on various apps that ranged from upset to anger to confusion. It was essentially him trying every option he could to get me to respond. The last message was a huge essay, where he stated that he loved me, but was going to have to end this relationship as he wasn’t feeling valued enough and felt dissatisfied with the amount we currently speak and have sex. It made me so mad to read so I simply responded with an ‘Ok, if that’s how you feel. I’ll pick up my stuff during the week.’

After this message, my boyfriend (ex??) span everything around on me saying how I wasn’t bothered we were over, put no effort into fixing things and had truly shown my true colors to him. I’m under a lot of stress at the minute with everything going on, outside of this family situation too, and this really bothered me. He then went on to say that he hadn’t meant it, and that we were still together. I said it doesn’t work like that and his immediate response was that I was therefore ending the relationship and this was now on me. I stopped communicating at that point as it felt like some kind of high school drama.
He’s now asking me if we are together and I have no idea what to say. He insists he never ended things (despite clearly doing so via text message). I would never have thought when these family issues arose that one of the outcomes would be leaving my boyfriend. I’m worried because my head is feeling very cluttered and stressed at the minute that I am not making a suitable decision. He has even gotten me confused about what is an appropriate amount of time to spend with my mother in a situation like this. Is he being a total a-hole and I’m totally missing it? Should I be being more attentive towards our relationship? Any advice would help at this point thank you 

Tl;dr My boyfriend ended things with me due to a recent decline in the amount we talk, because of family problems. When I said ok, he backtracked and said he hadn’t meant it and I am therefore the one ending things. Unsure how to react."
71,"I've (21f) been ""dibs'ed""


tl;dr: I've been dibs'ed by a friend in my friend group that I have no feelings for whatsoever, and it's affecting a potential relationship with a guy in the friend group I do have feelings for. 

(I'm on mobile, I'm sorry for all my errors and formatting)

For a little background: I recently (about a year and a half ago) entered a new friend group, all of whom I adore and have way too much fun with. We’re all pursuing the same degree and often share classes and all of that fun stuff. I thought that’d I’d genuinely entered a group of friends that respected me and who I can grow with on in this journey, and it’s a great feeling. Until I learned that one of the guys, (20m) we’ll call him Carl, in our group expressed “dibs” when we all first began hanging out and working together. Carl has admitted his feelings for me several times, both sober and drunk, privately and publicly. I have politely and sometimes not so politely refused and told him very plainly that he’s not my type, and that while I am flattered, nothing will happen between us.

Carl has projected this idea that I’m his perfect match, and often tells me that he’s “got me figured out.” As if I’m a mysterious puzzle box, and continues to try “win me over.” He constantly oversteps boundaries and consistency tells me what he thinks is best for me. His affections for me are well known by everyone in the group and is often joked about and our friends have often stuck up for me when he's being too overbearing. Which in its self is obnoxious, but I digress.

Anyway, the real problem is that myself and another guy in the group (21m, We’ll call him James) and I have been talking a lot recently and our friendship has blossomed into more of a flirtatious nature. James is very much my type of guy and we’re both very compatible.

A week ago, James asked me if I wanted to get together to work on a project for a class that he and I share. At this point, the flirting has been pretty heavy, there’s an obvious attraction there, so I jumped at the chance for some one on one time with him. It went great, we got a lot of great material for our project and had dinner. Towards the end of the evening says something along the lines of “I want to invite you back to my place but I don’t want Carl to find out about it.” I naturally assumed this was because Carl has very blatantly and obviously made his feelings for me known. We talked it over and I explained how many times I’d turned him down and that I was comfortable keeping a rendezvous secret in an effort to spare Carl’s feelings. So, we go back to his place and have a really great time.

During pillow talk I jokingly mention how persistent Carl is and explain how much it really bothers me sometimes, which leads to the mention of the whole “dibs” thing. Before I could say anything, he explained how bullshit he thought it was and how he’d have never made a move if I hadn’t mentioned previously that I’d turned him down several times.

I’m just so irritated about it and it’s gotten to the point where I didn’t go to our weekly outing as a friend group because I knew that Carl was going to say something to upset me and I was going to blow up on him.

I’m just so frustrated!

Like I have no idea what to do. I enjoy James a lot, and can see this going somewhere if given the chance. But I’m know that Carl would react badly because he feels as though he’s entitled to my affection.

I’m sorry if this is a bit rambley, my thoughts are so scattered about it. I appreciate any and all advice!"
72,"I [18M] finally stood up to my brother [25M] and it went as poorly as I expected. What should I do the next time I see him?


tldr: I finally snapped and stood up for myself to my brother via text. He's angry and I'm super scared. Not sure what to do when I see him tomorrow.

Growing up, it has always been my brother and I sticking together, at least that's the way I see it. Our parents worked all day everyday except Sundays, so it was my brother who took care of me for most of my life. I acknowledge that and I'm really grateful for it. I love him for it and I still do. However, I have always suffered a sort of anxiety around him that has been accentuated as of late. As we grew older, I naturally took on more responsibilities, but I feel like he was beginning to bully me into doing things, like some sort of revenge for having to take care of me over the years. Or like he's entitled to treating me a certain way because he has taken care of me. For years, I would do his laundry, wash the dishes, clean the house, etc. and then have him lash out on me if something wasn't done properly. However, most of the time he would refuse to do these things myself and get angry when I'd suggest that he do it instead. So I end up doing these chores anyway. It's kind of always been this way and I let it slide because we also had plenty of good times and I was sure that it could be my fault. After all, I'm younger and inexperienced.
However, things have been taking a turn for the worse in the past year or so. Ever since his boyfriend moved in (we still live with my parents), I feel like my brother has been a lot meaner to me. He is valuing his boyfriend's opinions much more than mine and I feel like I don't live in my own home anymore. My parents are aware of the boyfriend living in the house, but my brother has still not come out to them. I'm sure my parents know and are just waiting for him to say something, which I doubt will happen.
Anyway, now I'm doing both of their laundry, which of course includes dirty underwear. That feels pretty unfair. I'm still doing the dishes every night and cleaning a house that doesn't feel very much like my own anymore. My one solace in the house is my dog. I love my fucking dog. My brother got her maybe 6 years ago. Now she's getting older and I could tell he doesn't love her at all. He keeps making comments on how she hates her, or that she's an unloving dog, or that he wished she'd die so he can get a Husky. Not only is it horrible to wish that in the first place, but I know he'd fail to take care of the Husky. I'm the one walking her every single day and making sure she's happy. He likes to antagonize her and wonders why she's scared of him. To be fair, he does take her to the vet, but I feel like that's a low bar to meet. I feel like this is coming out more because his boyfriend hates her, too. They find her an inconvenience because she's old and paces at night. Apparently they can't stand it and can't sleep at all. Then they take their frustrations out on me, telling me I have to do something about it. It got to the point where my brother said either he will lock her in a cage, keep her in the basement, make me walk her for longer, or—. He trailed off here and I said ""What, you want to kill her?""
""Your words, not mine.""
I was shocked. He was making it sound like it was my idea. Obviously, I'm taking my dog out for long walks, even though this changes nothing. In one way, this works out for me. I hate being in the house. I am so anxious being around him.
At one point, I broke down while my brother wasn't home, but his boyfriend was. I was venting how I don't feel safe in my own home anymore, to which he replied ""How do you think I feel?"" I can't believe what I heard. He's acting as if this is more his home than mine. I had no words.
When I admitted that I wanted to kill myself, they both just said to me, ""You can't just feel like you want to kill yourself when you have problems. The real world is way tougher than that."" And maybe they're right. But I'm not so young and dumb that I haven't experience any of that ""real world"" and none of it has me on edge all the time like being at home. I can't seem to get an honest apology out of my brother. When he demanded from me what I wanted from him, I just said ""an apology."" He then said ""Look, I'm sorry. But you have to understand, when you're being a little shit to me, I'll be an asshole back."" I just don't understand.
And then there's the constant doubting. He's always doubting me and making me prove myself and whatnot. Just now, he texted me if I used shampoo to wash the dog. I said yes, of course I did. That would be a really strange thing to lie about. And he sends me a picture of the shampoo bottle that is close to empty, saying ""Doesn't look like it moved.""
I finally stood up for myself and said I don't understand why I always have to justify myself. He said it's because I'm a liar. I just said that I'm over it, he's petty, and he could say whatever he wants behind my back. I just don't care anymore. Then he simply texts me ""Get down here."" I'm panicking. By the way, my room is on the upstairs floor of the house while he takes up the entire bottom floor. I text him back no and I hear him scream ""GET DOWN HERE.""
I'm staying in my room. I have no idea what to do and I'm scared because I will see him tomorrow. I get the feeling he's going to make the argument that he's taken care of me for so long or something or that he pays for me, feeds me, buys me games, whatever. I feel like no matter what I say, he'll make me out as the bad guy like he's always done. What should I do?
Additional information if it's important: I'm a college student. I don't want to get my parents involved."
73,"my husband (37M) won't let me (33F) stay overnight with friends


tl;dr: my husband of almost a year doesn't want me to go to a concert in the city with my younger friends where we would have to stay overnight. 

My husband and I have been married almost a year, together almost 3. He moved out west for his job, I met him while I was here working on a temporary contract and decided to stay. Both of us have struggled to meet people or make friends here - this is a very small, conservative town and we are child free east coast liberals. I have had a little success, he seemingly has no interest in trying. 

I ended up making friends with two girls at my work (I work an overnight shift at a small business). They have known each other since middle school, but we've all become pretty close. Both of them are 25, and one is in a LTR of 4 years and the other is single. Neither are rowdy (there isn't much to do here if they wanted to be!). They invited me to come to a concert in the city with them, and since its a two hour drive through the mountains one way we would have to stay overnight in the city. There is no public transit this distance and I am terrified of long drives anyway, so staying overnight is really the only option. 

My husband is livid. He says its inappropriate for me to want to go to concerts anymore at ""our age"". I work lousy hours so I very very rarely have the energy to go out ever, but I really miss live music from when I lived in the city and I LOVE this band. I also haven't had a real girls night since I moved here three years ago! He does not want to go with me and the one time we went to a show together he got anxiety, hated it, drank too much and ruined it for me. He thinks I'm still going to return to my ""old ways"" which was almost five years ago and nothing that extraordinary - I went on dates, hooked up at bars. Pretty normal stuff. 

I'm torn about this. I've never given him a reason not to trust me in our relationship. We have a house and a car and dogs together and I'm totally devoted to our life. I gave up my friends and family and job to be here! But no matter what I tell him he says its inappropriate because we aren't the same age as my friends, that I'm abandoning him on Avengers weekend (he is a huge fan of the movies...I am not), and that he never knew any other wives to behave this way. He will not hear my feelings at all about his behaviour and attitudes and refuses to discuss them with me.  

Im afraid if I dont stand up for myself now it'll be harder next time I want to do something like this. But is going to a concert worth putting him (and me...since he won't speak to me when he gets worked up about it) through this? I feel awful but I don't think I'm being unreasonable."
74,"Boyfriend (25M) had MAJOR freak out after I (21F) came home at 11:30 and not 11:00.


I’m writing this minuets after he had a meltdown screaming and shouting at me like there’s no tomorrow. He locked himself up in his room as I write this. He gave me time to “think my actions through” and ONLY THEN come up to him with a “proper apology”. 

Sorry if this is long I’m trying to include everything. 

So I’m not a social person, I go out with friends once a month on good years. Last time I was out with friends was last year in December. I’m busy with studies and work, I have mental issues that hold me back from socialisation but you can’t tell unless I mention them myself. 

Just to give some background on the relationship, we had issues with him being controlling in the past and me being clingy but we have changed immensely and we’re literally different people than we were a few years ago. I’m truly proud of him for what he became in comparison to what he was and I honestly love him very much. 

With that being said, the actual outing happened yesterday.  This particular group of friends had been asking me to go or for a very long time, I haven’t been friends with them for too long and I was scared I would be anxious about it all. I decided to overcome my fears and challenge myself pretty much, I agreed to the offer. We met up at 6:00, 2 guys 2 girls and me. Had a walk around town, sat around, had fun and all, I truly missed being out and bonding with people. So he starts writing to me passive aggressively about “maybe you shouldn’t stay there till 11? Go to your moms perhaps.” (I hadn’t seen her in a while and I planned on sometime soon), later on he would write “this is why I don’t like when you go out. Why can’t you NOT come home at 12? How hard is it?” And at this point I think he’s being slightly petty and say things like “hey, chill out!” 

So that’s that, I come home at half past 11, and he’s ignoring me while he’s gaming. I sit around for a while waiting for him to acknowledge me he finally turns around, I ask “why are you so pissed off?” He suddenly starts screaming about how I don’t know my limits and going out doesn’t have to be till 12 am, how I don’t care about him and how he’s worrying about me and I’m a selfish person, etc. I don’t say anything for a while and then I ask him to calm down. He says he can not and I go to sleep hoping he’ll come to his senses tomorrow. 

Tomorrow (today) comes and I wake up, make breakfast think of how I should approach this subject. He sits down to eat and asks “don’t you want to say anything to me?” At this point I’m thinking oh no he wants an apology.. but I wanted to discuss why time limits are ridiculous.. this will be a problem. I basically tell him I’m not sure what I should say to him and he once again, FREAKS OUT, saying how he’s letting me out with friends and how he from a few years ago wouldn’t even do that, how selfish I’m being by forgetting that someone who cares for me and will maybe be with me forever is at home worried while some people who I’ve recently met and won’t be around for too long are more important to me in the moment. He says he fully 100% trusts me unlike other men who wouldn’t let their girlfriends out at all and i abuse this freedom. He should just not give a shit about me at all since that’s what I want apparently, and I don’t know my limits (even though my PERSONAL set limit is being home by 12 am) and I dont care about anything else.  Keep in mind I have A DRIVER who leaves me home, he’s been our family driver for more than 9 years. So it’s not like I’m walking home alone either. He then leaves screaming about how I should think this through thoroughly and then and only then come to him. (Hinting at me having to apologise). 

I’ve also been having very bad mood swings for 2 months since I need a change in medication and he’s been honestly helping me out so much it’s insane, he didn’t get mad when I would do dumb things like invade his personal space because of paranoia or starting fights over nothing where he would have to calm me down. He would just hug me and make me understand it’s just an episode I’m having and it’s okay. Point is he mentioned that too during his freak out and said I could’ve at least been him by 11 because of all that he’s done for me recently. 

So I’m lost, he’s waiting for me to show up with a grandiose apology if the century when I think he’s overreacting to fucking 30 minutes even though that is unnecessary already. Nothing changes since I have a private driver and I would be home before 12 because of my personal standards. We haven’t had a screaming session like this for more than 2 years and this brings back bad memories. He has not been controlling whatsoever for such a long time, he would only really worry usually. Please help. 


TL;DR - boyfriend REALLY freaks out over me coming home a little late, says I take him for granted and abuse his trust and my “freedom”, is now waiting for me to apologise but I don’t feel like I should?"
75,"What should I [32F] do about the rift with my MIL [64F] after the birth of my child?


TLDR; my MIL had a falling out with my husband and myself after the birth of our child. Now she and my husband have patched things up but it is still chilly between her and me, how should I approach this?

First, my MIL loves her family, and my husband is the apple of her eye. I do believe that her actions described below came from a place of joy and excitement.

My MIL is a difficult woman. She is a loud Type-A project planner, speak-to-the-manager type who tends to run roughshod over everyone to get her way, and she is both touchy and slow to forgive. Both my husband and her husband will readily admit this, although maybe not in so many words. My FIL is happy to follow her lead pretty much all the time. My husband, as a kid, was also along for the ride. Now as an adult he is starting to see how his mom's behavior can affect others and has always taken my side when needed... although as they say, old habits die hard.

My husband and I are both only children, so both our wedding and the birth of our child have been a *big deal* to our families. I first got a clue that my MIL would be difficult to deal with when it came to the wedding planning. I will spare you the saga but she basically attempted to take over the entire event - she was willing to help pay for it (my mom had already offered a very generous no-strings-attached contribution), but only if she was in control. This was not in keeping with my desires and created conflict between us. We had one particularly difficult phone call where she said a friend of hers was helping with her son's wedding, and was in charge of planning flowers and alcohol or something like that. I said that was a lovely suggestion and which parts would she like, but she became flustered and then made it clear that it was all or nothing. Finally the resolution was that I planned and financed the wedding without her, and she planned and hosted an elaborate ""welcome dinner"" at a different wedding venue, complete with separate fancy invitations, cocktail hour, floral decorations, elaborate catering, and a special welcome video. It was lovely if a bit much. 

Since then our relationship normalized. Generally if and when she says something I disagree with, I tend to bite my tongue rather than push back. We haven't had much cause for conflict, until now.

Before my child was born my husband and I had a conversation with his parents about when they would want to come visit. They live a plane ride away so it was necessary to talk about this in advance. I expressed that I wasn't sure how I would be feeling as it is my first child, but that I felt fairly sure I would be OK with a brief visit shortly after he is born, and a longer visit would be OK at some point thereafter.

Life threw us a curveball and my child was born early, which was unexpected. We had about 2 days warning, and we knew we would be facing a NICU stay. My husband was in charge of keeping both our families in the loop. The day of my induction I asked my husband when he was planning to return to our house to feed and walk our dog. He then confessed that his parents had *already arrived* to our area and would take care of it. I was immensely stressed to hear that they had showed up unannounced but was forced to forget about it and focus on my labor.

Eventually my child was born and taken to the NICU. It was late at night - after my initial recovery I was taken by wheelchair to see him, but I couldn't hold him at that time. I was then taken to a recovery room where I slept for a few hours. Upon waking I went back to the NICU with my husband and was elated to hear that this time I could hold him. I was just getting set up when a nurse approached and asked if I was expecting grandparents.

I was upset. I told my husband they needed to wait and he needed to deal with them. They wouldn't have even both been allowed back because the NICU policy is 3 visitors max at a time. After about 20 minutes my husband went to talk to them - I was expecting him to send them away. Instead he came back and asked if it would be ok if he waited outside so they could see our child.

Now - I would like to preface this by saying that a woman's hormones are WILD after childbirth. I was absolutely flooded with oxytocin because I was holding my child at that moment. Basically, I was blissed out. So I said sure, they can come back. To be honest it is something I regret, because that first hour should have been between me, my husband, and our child... and instead it was between me, my child, and my in-laws! Anyway. To an extent I blame my husband here for not backing my wishes well enough, but perhaps I wasn't as clear as I could have been, and as I said earlier old habits die hard.

I never spoke up to my in-laws about my frustrations with them coming unannounced both to my home and then to the hospital, I figured it would be better to have the conversation when I wasn't extremely hormonal and recovering from childbirth. The rest of their visit passed without incident, until the day they left.

I had asked repeatedly that they refrain from sharing the news on social media. The evening they left, my husband and I began to craft our birth announcement that we were planning to share. I opened my social media page and the very first thing I saw was my MIL's post, announcing the birth of my child. At this point I dissolved into hysterical tears, probably hormone driven, but I was absolutely devastated. I am still upset about it to be honest. My husband sent his mother some angry text messages, and thus began *the rift*.

She doubled down on her actions, said it was her news to share, and she felt she did nothing wrong. She then proceeded to give both of us the silent treatment for over a month, no joke. Over the course of this month I have had many painful conversations with my husband. I have told him that I feel her actions leave no room for my feelings, and that I am terrified that she is going to drive a wedge between us. He has been absolutely wonderful and reassuring to me, and I feel really good about his and my relationship. 

However I could see that the situation with his mother was tearing him up. At the end of the day she is his mom, and he loves her, and wants all to be well. I get that. It also came out that his mom believes I hate her. She said as much to my husband back in November (apparently I was too disengaged at Thanksgiving, when everyone was hanging around drinking which I couldn't do because I was pregnant) and he disclosed the information to me once this rift started, as a way to try to explain his mom's actions.

Now my husband and his mom have mended fences. My husband is pretty much ready to let his mom's silent treatment and behavior be water under the bridge for the sake of restoring normalcy between them. However things between me and my MIL are still not good - we've hardly spoken. I am still harboring resentment for the unannounced arrivals and the social media post, and we haven't even begun to address her belief that I hate her.

For the sake of my husband, I want to resolve things between us before her next (planned) visit, but I am really not sure where to start. I don't want to just blow off my feelings, but I am not sure I will get an apology or even an acknowledgement that she was even slightly out of line. What should I do?"
76,"My [24F] girlfriend [24M] hates the outdoors - camping, exploring national parks, etc. I've never minded but now that the talk of kids is on the table I worry we're incompatible. Am I being stupid?


We've been together for almost 5 years now. We're both introverts who enjoy socializing, which is quite rare, and I think why we get along so well together. We both love going to large events, parties, etc, and then spending the next 48 hours recovering mentally by being hermits inside. The one difference we have is that I love the outdoors and she... doesn't. Her idea of a good time ""outside"" is hitting up a few stores and browsing for new home decor, whereas mine is going on a hike, camping, exploring national parks, etc.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

It was never really a problem before. I'd always take my pup hiking, go camping with my friends &amp; baseball team, etc. She'd sometimes come, but would never really enjoy herself. No biggie - I was always fine enjoying those things with my friends. We have a \*\*beautiful\*\* national park (famous enough that it attracts literal busloads of tourists) from Toronto literally 45 minutes away - a gorgeous 45 minute hike, followed by cliffs and a walking path down to crystal blue water with underwater caves to explore, secret swimming holes, etc. and she refuses to go with me. Again, fine, no biggie. It kind of sucks since we live in a smaller town and nature is the only benefit to living here, but again I've always just went with friends.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

We've been talking about marriage for some time now and have been in the process of looking at engagement rings, talking about kids, etc. Then it hit me like a brick wall - after we have kids.. who will I do all of the things I love with? I always pictured raising my kids and involving them with the beauty of nature - tons of hiking, camping trips, etc. I've talked to my girlfriend and she has \*\*no\*\* interest in any of that. Which I knew, but never really thought this far ahead about. Now I'm stuck with the dilemma - if we have kids will I be stuck taking him on camping trips without mom? No weekends spent kayaking on the local rivers? 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

\*\*TL;DR:\*\* Girlfriend hates outdoors, I love it. Has never been an issue, always just went with friends. Talking about kids and it hit me like a wall - will this be a problem down the road?"
77,"My (26F) co-worker (36F) is an emotional mess. There's bad news for her coming down the pipe but she doesn't know. How do I handle her?


I'm having a hard time with figuring out the best way to handle my teammate while still maintaining my own sanity. I deal with social anxiety that can be pretty bad at times so I'm not always the best at handling these situations on my own and could use some advice.

My (26F) co-worker (36F) and I have been working together for over 3 years (she's been there for 7 now). This co-worker in particular was basically my mentor when I started, she pretty much taught me everything I know. We're at a point where we are both considered experts at our stuff and are both recognized as such. She's extremely talented and smart, she's great at what she does in her job. To give some general background, our office has multiple small teams of less than 10 people each. Co-worker and I have been on the same team for about a year now. Our little team has been chronically understaffed for a while so when one person is overworked, stressed, out of the office, or just not pulling their weight, the rest of us feel it too. This is pretty important as it factors into the general mood of our team right now.

The problem I've been facing with my co-worker is that she gets very emotional about things and takes a LOT of stuff personally. Some of it is justifiable but a lot of it just seems so petty. If something doesn't go her way at work, she feels disrespected because she is a senior member amongst all the teams and will outright pout about it. We're also intended to be a very flexible team but if there's something she doesn't want to do, she just won't and it's up to someone else (usually me) to take on that task. She's also extremely resistant to any form of change and will straight up argue with our manager about it, even though most of the time it's a decision passed down from the higher ups. 

The biggest way this has manifested has been that she's been interviewing for a slew of internal positions and none of them have gone her way. She's been turned down for 2 positions in the last year in favor of ""less senior"" team members. I thought she was a great fit for both of these positions but so were the other folks. Each time she was turned down, it was weeks of moping, occasional hostility, and crying about how she wasn't good enough for anything. Her drinking also seems to have picked up a lot since the second time she was turned down and she's already got a sizable drinking habit. She was mad at the people who got the positions over her and told me she felt like she deserved the jobs more because she's got seniority. And since she's been drinking more, she seems to get even more emotional about stuff all the time. The Facebook and IG posts are so melodramatic. She dumps a lot of her anxiety on me and I don't know how to deal with it sometimes as a person wrangling my own anxiety. The hardest part about all of this is that all of us on the team feel like we have to tiptoe around her when she's like this in order to keep the rest of us from having to pull all her slack. Like I know she has stuff going on, but so do the rest of us and we still do our jobs! 

But what's got me worried and what really brought me here: She recently interviewed for another internal position that she's been trying to get at for years. She's already been a mess waiting to hear back because of her previous let downs and they've already taken longer than expected to give any of the interviewees feedback. I'm not privy to the hiring process and wasn't supposed to know this, but I was recently told that the person they're going with is not her. In fact, it's going to be someone completely out of left field for everyone, but a good choice. If the people that got chosen over her for the other positions were a big deal, this one might be THE big deal. I can't tell anyone about this since I'm not supposed to know in the first place. I know this is going to be a huge deal when it comes down the pipe, maybe even this week. I'm just not sure how to deal with the aftermath without making it worse.

Sidenote: What she also doesn't know is that another internal position is coming open soon, one that I know both of us are going to go for as it directly relates to our expertise. I plan on being very low-key on applying but I know there's going to be tension. But I can't help but feel so anxious about it because we'll be directly competing against each other and I almost feel guilty at the thought of potentially getting the position over her (but dammit, I want it and I'm going for it!).

So I could use some tips on preparing myself for the impending meltdown. My manager knows about the tension and issues we've had with her in the past, but there's only so much he can do (it's complicated but he's tired of it too). I know she's going through a rough patch but we've all got work to do and this is starting to take a toll on everyone.

TL;DR: My coworker gets emotional and mopey about everything that doesn't go her way. She's already been turned down for 2 internal positions and (unbeknownst to her) is about to get turned down for a 3rd. I know there's going to be a meltdown and a lot dumped on me and our team, how do I prepare myself?"
78,"My [20M] girlfriend's [19F] relationship with her best friend [25F] makes me uncomfortable


Long story, apologies in advance.

tl;dr - Girlfriend's best friend and her have a very intimate relationship. Only difference between their relationship and ours is the physical intimacy. Am I overreacting for feeling very uncomfortable or do I need to change my viewpoint?

Me and my now girlfriend, let's call her Emily, have known each other for 9 years, been together for close to 5 months in a long-distance relationship (it's only about 50 miles but we still feel the distance). We'd been in love all of high school and beyond, but only recently felt it a good time to give our relationship a serious try. It's been mostly amazing so far, we're very much in love with each other and want to spend the rest of our lives together. 

However, in that 9 years prior to us becoming a serious couple, we tried our relationship out before in the summer of 2017, and it didn't work out. We didn't talk for 6 months after that stint as it was simply too painful for both of us. Emily has a lot of mental health issues, which doesn't affect my perception of her at all, I still love her regardless, but this means she needs a lot of support. Now at the school we both went to Emily met a trainee counsellor in early 2017 there who she struck up a friendship with, and after the counsellor left our school, they became best friends. Let's call this friend of Emily's, Ruby.

I can't knock Emily and Ruby's friendship, from what I've been told they connected over similar opinions, similar attitudes and a shared painful past experiences. Ruby was there for Emily when I was unable to be, she helped her through a lot and if I'm being honest I doubt Emily would still be alive if it wasn't for Ruby's intervention when she was very mentally ill. 

When Emily and me started talking again in the Spring of 2018, I knew of Ruby's existence. It was no business of mine, I just knew of her existence. Fast-forward to November of 2018, me and Emily finally get together, it'd been a long time coming. 

In the next few weeks I noticed the way Emily and Ruby texted each other, it was very strange. For quick clarification she looks over when I'm using my phone and I used to shoot glances at their conversations. Emily and Ruby talked like they were in a relationship of their own, saying things like: ""I love you so much baby"" and ""I can't wait to see for cuddles!"" things like that. Things I thought that Emily used to say to me. Emily has also nicknamed Ruby on Facebook as ""Mummy"". The two are very close and despite Ruby having a long-term, serious boyfriend she always goes to Emily for comfort and always asks for cuddles and for Emily to come back to our home town from where she's going to university. 

Emily had also told me that the two were very comfortable around each other, going as far as holding hands in public, hugging and sleeping in the same bed (all of which are fine by me and don't make me uncomfortable), but Emily told me that they occasionally kissed on the lips. This immediately made me uncomfortable to the point where I had to say something and asked her to not to do that with Ruby anymore, to which she, at the time reluctantly agreed. There's certain intimacy's I ask that be kept in our relationship.

As time goes on whenever me and Emily are together I start to notice that if Emily doesn't text Ruby back immediately a lot of the time she starts texting ""Baby I need you"" or ""I love you so much please reply"" and it's just one of many things that makes me uncomfortable about their relationship.  Whenever me and Emily FaceTime she constantly goes off and replies to texts which I know are from Ruby yet when she's with Ruby when she visits her at university she takes a long time to reply to my texts. 

Around Christmas time I finally met Ruby, and we didn't get along very well. It was me, Emily, Ruby and Ruby's boyfriend as well as a fair amount of alcohol. Throughout that night Ruby and Emily cuddled on a sofa while I kind of sat by myself awkwardly while they were very (jokingly) flirty. Emily did come over and sit with me as well, but at one point she sort of straddled Ruby and the two were very comfortable and giggling about it. At this point I had to walk out of the room for a cigarette because the situation made me very uncomfortable. Additionally, Ruby made some comments about our relationship, referring to an argument me and Emily had had a few weeks before. This annoyed me beyond words. She was arrogant about it, it wasn't her place to comment in front of me, as I barely knew her. Now don't get me wrong, Emily and Ruby can talk about our relationship all they want when I'm not there, I just think it's incredibly rude 

The past few months me and Emily have talked her and Ruby's friendship and how it makes me uncomfortable a few times, especially in regards to how intimate they are. Emily always brushes this off by saying that their friendship is a ""normal girl one"" and that it's okay. I have a lot of close female friends, I'd go as far to say the majority of my friends are women and I've never seen a relationship between two women that Emily and Ruby have, at least not as close. 

Whenever Emily comes back to our home town she always spends some very separate time with Ruby in which she, again, barely replies to my texts, yet when we're together and sees me she's constantly replying to Ruby. She's a 20 minute walk away at Ruby's place yet I can't feel like I can see her, despite not being able to do so for 

At this point I'm getting sick and tired of feeling like I'm in a polygamous relationship. The only difference I see in the relationship that me and Emily have and the one she has with Ruby is the physical side. 

I'm not at all for asking Emily to choose between me and Ruby. We both mean a lot to her, and I don't want to force her to make such an awful decision. I want to be okay with the intimacy they have but I'm just sick and tired of feeling left by the wayside for their friendship.

They are both moving in together next year and I want to be sure on my feelings on Ruby and feel okay about her and Emily's friendship.

Reddit, am I being too sensitive? Am I in the right? Any suggestions and advice are welcome, be as straightforward and blunt as you need to be, I'm willing to change my viewpoint if need be."
