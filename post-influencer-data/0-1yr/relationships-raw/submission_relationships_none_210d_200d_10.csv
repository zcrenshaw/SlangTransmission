0,"UPDATE : my [24f] partner [24m] doesn’t do things unless I specifically ask him to. It’s driving me insane


[original post](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/a2c42f/my_24f_partner_24m_doesnt_do_things_unless_i/?st=JS8PE29K&amp;sh=f62389f8)


Hey everyone, I wrote this post just over a month ago, and i got a lot of advice and help and thought I should do an update.

I took a lot of your advice. I spoke to him about it again, and said we need to come up for a solution because I couldn’t go on with such little help anymore. 

We wrote a list as someone had suggested . (Sorry I don’t know how to link usernames) and I wrote what I do and he wrote what he did. My list was much bigger than his and he said he didn’t realise How ‘unequal’ the lists were and he thought we were doing pretty much the same. He thanked me for everything I did, and said he’d change.

We take it in turns with the nappy changes and the story times etc and it’s working very well.

Now we have certain things we both need to get done. He will bath the kids on the nights he’s home so he gets to spend more one on one time. He’ll read stories and is being much more involved.

I still do a lot which I’m fine with, (the things SAHP do) but I want to stay home with the kids and do the majority as I feel that’s what I’m happiest with doing. I’m just appreciative of the help he’s now giving me. I don’t feel alone anymore. 

I think with a new baby and a toddler and working full time, it was getting a bit on top of him but we communicate better and when he’s feeling overwhelmed, I’ll do more and vice versa.

I do think I have to ask him some things still, but I feel like that only happens when we have had a bit of a busy/hard day. but we have more of an understanding of one another now. 

We also read the articles commenters recommended and that is definitely in the back of our mind. 

I do feel I got into the habit of doing things myself and would bathe and read, etc without really giving him that time and now I’m encouraging him even more to do things one on one with the kids. As I was always there when he was spending time with them, I’m trying to make it where he actually gets alone time with them as well. As I think that was making him feel like a “secondary “ parent if that makes sense. He has a much better bond with the kids now, and we are all so much happier. As a family and us as a couple. 

I might have missed things so if you wanna know anything else ill answer.
I know this isn’t the most amazing update and it’s just a case of communicating better but you’ve all helped so much and I’m very appreciative. I love reddit!

Thanks for all your comments/advice. 


TLDR : a case of communicating better and following your advice has helped us thanks so much

1,"UPDATE: Me [21F] with my ex-bf[20M] of 4 months, dumped me for having borderline... but I don't have it


**Original thread:**

https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/aowfy4/me_21f_with_my_exbf20m_of_4_months_dumped_me_for/

**TL;DR of that thread:**

Ex-bf overheard me talking about bpd in an academic context, assumed I have it, and then dumped and blocked me before I can explain. Now he's telling people I have bpd. What should I do?

**This post:** 

Well, here's my cliched intro: I read every single comment in response to my last thread. Yeah, all of them. Including the ones recommending I post on FB about it. (I am sure there is some social Einstein out there who could do that while coming off well, but I am not that social Einstein, so I didn't try it.) I stopped replying somewhat early because I was... tired.

Before I explain what happened next, I need to be clear: I didn't want to be with him anymore. For more than one reason. I could never trust him again. Maybe that sounds too sensitive, but when he walked out on me like that, it showed me a future I didn't want. One with a man whose pains are so great and so deep that he won't hesitate to harm me in his attempt to save himself. 

I also couldn't be okay with how he was talking about some imaginary person (who happened to have my name) with BPD. I don't have it, but what if I did? What then? Then it would be okay to try and make everyone hate me even though I never did anything to him? I don't think so. 

I want to treat people with BPD. Not to hate them. I can't be with anyone who hates them all because he automatically sees his mother's face in the diagnosis. 

**What happened next:**

I decided to take the advice of:

* Having my friends explain the truth whenever it was brought up, including them referring anyone to my advisor

* Me actually talking to my advisor about it 

I thought really carefully about contacting him directly to set him straight. But I couldn't get over feeling hesitant to do it after he asked me not to. So I just figured, you know, he'd hear the truth from my friends, and if he wanted to seek me out he would.

That's what happened. 

He showed up banging at my door. This was kind of shocking because he's seemed so calm throughout our relationship, but he was knocking on my door like some police officer or something. It was late and I was in my pajamas and totally disoriented. (Thank God my roommate wears earplugs...) I let him in and he was just so horrified by what he'd done.

I don't think he actually *understood* the extent of the wrongness of how he'd behaved, but he did understand one thing: he realized he'd guessed wrong about why I was discussing BPD on the phone, and he was so sick over it he said he'd been throwing up. He said he was so sorry and so worthless and he'd never do it again. He said he despised himself for destroying something wonderful. He told me the things his mother had actually done. The actual specifics. It was horrific. 

The best I could do was hold him and stroke his hair until he was even breathing at a normal rate and not crying.

I didn't want to take him back as a partner but I wanted to help but, really, I can't. I can't do that. 

I just told him he's so lovable, and he deserves better than what happened, and he won't be able to have better until he gets help. I said he needs help from a therapist. I said he's a big asshole if he rejects psychology while he needs help from psychologists so badly. (This might sound harsh, but it fit the sense of humor we shared when we were together.) I also said it's not fair that his mother gave him the needs he has, but that they now belong to him.

Eventually I managed to get him out of the apartment. I drove him home in his car and then called an Uber to get me back to mine. I have not heard or sought out any information about him since then, but I guess that means he's not talking about me. I hope he's getting help. "
2,"My (33F) husband (32M) of 3 years is fapping his life away and I don't know what to do anymore.


He has no job, nothing else he wants to do with me or even by himself, no social life anymore, and from where I'm standing he basically has become a husk of the person he used to be.

Some days I feel like all he does anymore is stay in his office with eyeballs glued to internet porn. He will watch porn all night but never wants to have actual sex. What gives? Sometimes when I wake up at 6am he's still in his office, never came to bed.

To say it's porn 24/7 is only a slight exaggeration. 

His friends no longer try to contact him. They gave up ages ago after he kept bailing on plans to sit online jerking to porn.

I'm not too worried about money, as I have a high earning job. It's the principle of the thing and the personality change. He used to have ambition, he was successful.

He's become sexually creepy. That's when he displays any interest in me whatsoever, that is. Which is maybe a few days a month.

I think he has also developed fetishes from the amount of porn he's watching. The constant exposure makes him think it's normal and it takes root in his brain.

He password protected his computer so I have no idea what he could be doing. He won't talk to me about it. He spends most of his time locked in his office except for getting food and using the bathroom. I can hear the porn playing and him fapping. This is his life every damn day. He even brings his food up there to eat while watching porn.

I'm so sick of this. Who even is he, I feel like I don't know him.

The worst part to me isn't my marriage though, it's our daughter's relationship to him. It's like he does not care to spend any time with her. She's old enough to realize when she's being brushed off or snapped at because he's so impatient to get back to squirrelling himself away in a porn-induced masturbatory haze.

I'm utterly miserable. There are days I don't even see him. We live in the same house and I don't see my own husband because he just yells through the door that he's ""busy."" I'm lucky he still goes out to do some errands sometimes. Anything else I have to nag him, like I'm battling with a child.

We are too goddamn young for this. There are so many things I want to do with my family, and he cannot peel himself away from the pornographic abyss of his computer. What kind of life is that. I want my partner back, not this zombie.

What is there to do about a situation like this?

Tl;dr: Husband has gotten hooked on porn. I don't know why, and I can't know because he refuses to talk when I try. I feel like he's just fapping his life away when there's so much we could be doing together.  "
3,"My[M24] family has relied on me to be the family IT guy for years. Now that I work in IT I don't want to spend my free time doing additional IT work and some of them are upset. What can I do?


I'll try and keep it short.

My family is full of tech illiterate people.  Since I was in high school I've been the go to for fixing tech problems.  If there is an issue they will usually text or call me and they can drop it off for me to look at if its something I can't fix over the phone.  However now I work in IT so I am spending 8-10 hours a day fixing other people's tech issues and now I don't want to spend more time outside of working doing the same thing. 

I explain that if it is something super quick I can help with over text then I'll try, but that anything more than that and I need them to look it up themselves or go to a shop to get it fixed. Most of them were very understanding.  Some were not.  My aunt actually pretended to not see my message explaining my situation to her and she showed up at my doorstep with a box full of things she wanted fixed.  I refused to take them and explained that I don't have time to do these things for them anymore.  She called me selfish and said I don't care about family anymore before she threw the box in her car and drove off.  

The next day I started getting texts from a few other family members that wanted things fixed telling me I was selfish and that ever since I got that new job I've been acting like I'm too good for family.  This really hurt.  I've even been uninvited to a family party I was looking forward to because it is at Aunt's house and she doesn't want me there.

Is there anything I can do here?  Or do I just have to accept that some of my family sucks and move on?

TL;DR: Am the family IT guy.  Got a job in IT now don't have time or energy to help family with complicated technical issues.  Aunt and some other family members mad.  What do?"
4,"(UPDATE) My [23F] boyfriend [29M] keeps making my depression about him and it only makes me feel more hopeless.


Original Post: https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/9q3b3p/my_23f_boyfriend_29m_keeps_making_my_depression/

Not sure anyone would care for an update, but I figured I'd make one anyways.

After my post, things kept going as they were. He kept making my depression about him, not really listening to me or empathizing with my feelings. I just got a little too overwhelmed by him. He started to blame me for my feelings ""affecting"" him so negatively. He was upset that my depression was making *him* bummed out. I started going in to a downward spiral of depression. 

The long story short is that we broke up about a month ago. It started off as a ""break"" so I could just deal with it on my own without ""affecting"" him, but now it is permanent. 

Anyways... About two days after the break started, I immediately started noticing I wasn't feeling as depressed anymore. I know the depression will always come back in swings, but at least I don't have to deal with him digging in the way he was. He's upset that we won't be getting back together but I feel infinitely less stressed.

TL;DR: Boyfriend was digging in and making my depression about him. We split up and now I am no longer in a downward spiral. "
5,"UPDATE: My(F15) mom (F42) made me cry in public and was confused and angry that I embarrassed her and my family


Those of you that read my post on my mom, welcome back, those of you who haven't I suggest you read it so this makes sense.

https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/amnfse/my_mom_42f_keeps_pushing_me_15f_to_exercise_even/?st=JSEANENZ&amp;sh=ff98c147


So, we (as in my dad, mom, grandma and grandpa) were at a well known burger restaurant that doubled as a bar for dinner, my grandma got us all potato skins because they were *really* good. I love potato skins, especially this restaurants potato skins, my family knows this. I reach for one of the halves and immediately got my hand grabbed by my mom.

Mom: don't you think you should wait until we order our actual dinner?

Feeling a bit upset at this, but too tired to do anything (I'm always tired honestly), I just pulled my hand back and started playing on my phone, wrong choice. My mom grabbed my phone and placed it on my thigh, screen down.

Mom: don't do that right now it's rude, just talk with us!

The conversation was about something I dreaded being a part of, politics. I said nothing because I didn't want to get stupid slapped by my dad (if you don't know what that is it's just a light slap on the back of the head) THAT was the wrong choice too.

Mom: you're being rude! Why don't you talk with us?

Me: I uh don't know much about politics...

Mom: well say what you know!

Me *being someone who's a regular watcher of people like NateTalksToYou*: I think that some parents are teaching their kids wron-

Mom: where'd you learn that? Oh let me guess, YouTube? Honestly you need to spend less time on the internet and more time with us!

(Note; whenever I do try to spend time with them, they get super mad and say I'm annoying them)

I wait until we order, and I had been practicing what I was gonna say in my head over and over again, double steak burger with fries. I look up at the waitress and get halfway through my order when my mom butts in with,

Mom: Oh, excuse my little piggy, she's biting off more than she can chew (I didn't eat anything that day and was starving) She'll just have a salad, she needs to get ready for her trip to {my home state}

That was it, that was the trigger, I would've been upset but fine with her just changing my order, as she always does, but calling me ""piggy"" was a trigger for bad memories, I stood up said a quick ""Excuse me"" to my family and speed walked outside where I started crying. My mom followed me out, pissed.

Mom: WHAT THE HELL WAS THAT?! WHY DID YOU JUST LEAVE?!

Me *sobbing*: I d-didn't want anyone to s-see me c-cry...

Mom *confused*: WHY ARE YOU CRYING?! YOU JUST EMBARRASSED YOUR ENTIRE FAMILY!

Me *sobbing harder and starting to get angry*: y-you changed my order and c-called me piggy

Mom: So what?! You're upset because I'm trying to help you lose some pounds?! It's not my fault you sit around all day eating chips and cookies! (I don't, I clean and do laundry)

Me *getting angrier*: But you k-know I have bad memories with name calling!

Mom: Oh get over it {my name}! It happened 2 years ago! 

Me *getting louder and letting out all my anger*: AND?!  YOU HAVENT LET GO OF ANYTHING PEOPLE SAID TO YOU 30 YEARS AGO MOM! AND YEA I DO EAT COOKIES AND CHIPS BECAUSE I EAT ALMOST NOTHING EVERY DAY! DO YOU EVEN REMEMBER WHEN I WAS STARVING MYSELF?!

Mom *confused and angry*: IT WAS DIFFERENT FOR ME AND DONT YOU DARE SPEAK TO ME LIKE THAT YOUNG LADY!

By now, my dad, grandma and grandpa have all come out to see what the yelling was.

Me: YEA IT WAS DIFFERENT FOR YOU BECAUSE  YOU DIDNT HAVE YOUR OWN MOTHER TELLING YOU TO LOSE SOME WEIGHT!!!

That kinda clicked something in her head, but she chose to ignore it.

Mom: THATS IT, YOU ARE STAYING AT YOUR GRANDPARENTS UNTIL YOU LEARN SOME RESPECT!

While this was happening my family was just watching this all unfold, horrified because I had never been so angry. My mom got in her car, with my dad getting in the passenger seat trying to get her to calm down, I've been with my grandparents for a little over a week. My grandma has done nothing but give me food saying ""It's ok, I won't take it away"" and my grandpa making daily calls with my mom about ""She's your daughter!"" and ""I get that but it's different nowadays"" I don't know if I should apologize or wait this out until my mom realizes what she's been doing to me, I'm still working out but I'm eating 3 meals a day with more food.

Should I apologize and go back or wait until she sees what she's doing to me? 

TL;DR: Mom and I have screaming match after she called me a name that brings bad memories and changes my food order and tells me I'm staying with my grandparents until I learn respect.

P.S. My grandparents and mom and dad don't live that far apart so it's not like I'm 4 cities away, we're still in the same town"
6,"I [25F] asked my date [26M] to text me when he gets home so I know he’s safe, and he responded rudely.


Curious. After a late night date I told the man I was seeing to text me when he gets home safely. He was driving home, and I was just worried because it was snowing pretty heavily. I didn’t mean to insult him or his driving skills, he’s an excellent driver. I just thought I would feel more comfortable at night knowing he made it home okay. When I told him if he could send me a text, he pretty rudely said “What are you, my mother? I know how to drive just fine.” I was just expressing concern, I really didn’t mean it that way. This was our third date, and I haven’t asked him to text me in the past. I only asked him this time because of the weather. I didn’t expect him to react so rudely, and he didn’t text me, either. 

When he responded that way, I explained that I would ask the same of anyone I just spent that night with, no matter who they were. I said that I didn’t mean to say that he was a poor driver (I’m not even sure how he came to that conclusion in the first place), but that the roads were terrible and I would sleep better at night knowing that he made it home without any issues. He said, “I’m a man. I can handle myself. It’s not your place to tell me to text you.”

I was shocked that he was arguing with me over something so simple, so I left it alone. He texted me saying that he had a great time and would like to see me again soon, but I’m not really feeling it, but I’m also not sure if I’m overreacting. 

TL;DR: Asked date to text me when he made it home safely because he would be driving late at night during a blizzard, he sarcastically said “What are you, my mother?” I don’t know if what I thought was a simple request was really naggy.

7,"My (F22) mom (F63) hid letters from my dad's family for years


My parents got divorced when I was 2 years old. I was allowed some visitation with my dad's side of the family, then supervised visitation until I was 4 or 5. My entire childhood was shaped by the narrative my mom told me: that my dad was bipolar, physically and emotionally abusive, and that his whole family was crazy and supported him. She would always say ""that family ruined our lives"" as she fought my dad's efforts to gain custody for years. She also wouldn't let me go to a lot of social events or sleepovers because she was paranoid someone might know someone in my family and take me away from her.

Fast forward to age 18. I have a terrible relationship with my mom and stepdad, who I never bonded with. I have spent years being abused emotionally and sometimes physically. I don't want to get into all the details, but my stepdad was a recovering alcoholic and my mom, I believe, is undiagnosed bipolar or borderline. She refuses to get tested or get help. 

I had decided I wanted visitation with my dad again when I turned 18 and the restraining order fell. I knew he made some horrible decisions but I still wanted to at least get to know him. He also was on the waiting list for a kidney transplant. 

I didn't have a car so my mom kept pushing out a time for me to go meet him under supervision.

I was in the gym when I suddenly got a Facebook message from my dad's sister saying he had just passed away and sharing where the funeral would be held.

My mom didn't even let me go to the funeral...

Months later, my aunt invited me to Thanksgiving at their house where everyone (like a LOT, I have a huge family on my dad's side) got together, and I went. I was nervous so I brought my roomie with me. I had no idea what they thought of me or my mom but I wanted a chance to know them.

I have never had a holiday filled with so much love and laughter and fun. Every holiday it was just me, my mom and my stepdad. They usually ended up having a screaming match at some point so I would hide in my room. We never had people over because my parents didn't have that many friends and NO family they were in touch with, except my grandma who had passed away when I was 12.

My dad's brother literally had tears when he told me how amazing it was to see me after all these years and that he was just thrilled to see how smart and driven and beautiful I'd grown up to be. 

I also got to see my nana, who is like the great matriarch of the family. She's 96, I believe. For some reason, she just was enthralled with me. (I'm kind of obsessed with nana now, she is just the cutest, most loving woman). Everyone was just asking me all these questions about school and what I like to do and apparently a lot more people than usual came, just to see me.

It's been like this for the last few Thanksgivings and Christmases. Sometimes they'll come into the city where I go to school to have dinner. I don't tell my mom I see them. I tried to talk to her about it and every time she just starts screaming about how they ruined her life by backing up my dad in court...

In January this year, my aunt gave me a box and told me not to open it until I got home, but that my nana used to write me letters back when they lose visitation rights with me. Even though nana is old now and doesn't even remember writing them, when she found them my aunt wanted me to have them.

It's literally like The Notebook. I took out these huge spiral bound notebooks filled with words from the top to bottom of every page. 

Every. Single. Day. For years, since my fifth birthday.

The first letter is the most heartbreaking because she says, ""I'm including the letter from your mother's attorney requesting that we stop sending packages and letters. You will probably be an adult well before you read this, and I may no longer be alive. But I just wanted you to know how many people love and care about you here and we are always praying and thinking of you.""

So for years, they were sending me packages and birthday and holiday cards and I never saw any of it.

Anyone have advice with what to say to my mom? I haven't told her that I know yet, and we fought about something else so haven't been speaking for a while anyways.

TLDR; For years, I could have had a family, had cousins to play with, got to see my nieces and nephews grow up. Instead I was miserable, forced to be homeschooled, hardly ever saw any friends, and developed a plethora of anxiety and trust issues from living with my mom. But I am just so thankful that curiosity stayed with me and that I did reach out to them, because now I have a whole group of people who kinda look like me (so weird!) and love me to pieces.

8,"Had a massive falling out with my [21M] mom [52F] because of her parasite husband [50sM]. A lot of feelings were hurt and don't know how to move forward or if I was right or not.


My mom has been married for 7 years to a man who leeches off her. He's had multiple different dead end jobs over the years and has spent large amount of times unemployed in between. He contributes nearly nothing and my sister and I both find him deeply unbearable.

A few months back my sister (21) told him he wasn't contributing at all and he got angry and said he had always contributed with credit cards (which mom pays off anyway later) and refills water bottles (that was his big winning argument, I guess). Mom doesn't put him in his place, ever.

He also pawned our late sister's golden earrings for bet money and my sister and I found out months later. Mom also didn't do anything about that and I don't even want to think about it ever again.

He's done many innapropriate things over the years, spoken to us as if he owns the place (it's mom's home) and many other things. It's too long a story to tell. 

Yesterday he and I started an argument over something honestly petty I don't even want to talk about, but that was like the last drop for me and I got in his face and told him everything I hated about him leeching off mom and he got intimidated and left the house. He came back with mom last night and I told mom to choose between him and me. She started crying and I told her she had no dignity left and I was disgusted she would go low enough to marry a man like him. I asked her again and she just cried so I decided to leave. Started packing my things and left others to come back later.

My sister cried and begged me to not go but I left anyway and said many things to her too that she didn't deserve. I went to dad's home. In the past months I've gotten more and more frustrated with mom's husband and had been staying with dad and he told whenver I wanted to leave he would take me in indefinitely. So I went there and he welcomed me.

It's been nearly 24 hours since I left and I still feel enraged and frustrated, but it's been wearing off slowly and I realized that I really pushed mom too far and said terible things to her and my sister. I apologized to my sister and she accepted it and we talked for a while. I'm not ready to apologize to mom yet, though, as she has enabled his BS all these years.

I talked to dad and he gave me some tough love about the way I behaved and I think that's fair, but he also said he would be extremely frustrated, too. So now I just... don't know. I don't know how to move forward from this, I don't know what the future holds for my relationship with mom. She has despite everything been a caring mom, but I can't reconcile with the fact that she has let this man leech off her for so long and hasn't done anything about it.

I kinda feel like I lost respect for her and will never see her the same way again.

Am I justified in what I feel? Did I act the wrong way? Is this the best for me? How should I handle all this from now on? I am scared and feel like my family is crumbling even more because of what I did. I'm confused and don't know what to do.

**tl;dr:** Finally snapped at my parasite step father for leeching off us for seven years. Asked mom to pick between him and me and when she cried I left on my own and am staying with dad, who had told me I could stay with him whenever I wanted to. I am now confused and feel a lot different things. How the F am I supposed to move forward from this? Is what I did justified? I just need advice right now."
9,"UPDATE: How do I (21m) tell my older brother (27m) that I’m addicted to drugs


[Original Post] (https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/a1n4rf/how_do_i_21m_tell_my_older_brother_27m_that_im/?st=JSDCPU1X&amp;sh=6f94cd15)

My original post didn’t get a huge amount of attention but some people were asking for an update when I had one so here goes. 

Long story short, I guess I wasn’t hiding my addiction very well (shocker I know) and my brother straight up just asked me what I was on. We had an hour long frank conversation where he told me he thought I was an idiot for thinking I could keep this from him (and he agreed not to tell our parents) and I agreed to go to detox at the hospital (we live in Canada so, free). 

I don’t want to talk about what the detox was like as I’m sure people can imagine and others who have gone through it can explain it better than me, but yeah, it wasn’t fun. 

Anyways, this was two months ago. I have been clean since then and I am on a waiting list to see a therapist. 

I didn’t tell him about the money for sex, and he didn’t ask me how I was getting all the money. I have been having problems with the more sketchy people I had coming around bothering me after I cut contact with them, but honestly there isn’t really much I can do about it. 

People will probably call me an idiot for this and I know I am being an idiot, but I still haven’t gotten tested for anything yet, not HIV or anything. It’s not that I can’t, it’s that I’m scared to death. The men who I slept with for money, some of them were super sketchy and were sick with who knows what. But I didn’t care back then. 

Either way, I haven’t gone to get tested, even though I know I’m being stupid. 

Just thought I’d throw this update out there. 

Tl;dr: Talked to my brother, did detox, still haven’t gotten STI checked.

10,"My [27M] GF [23F] states she wants a partner who pays for everything


So my girlfriend and I have been dating for 7 months and been hanging for a total of 10 months. We get along well, have great sex and have similar interests.

From the beginning of the relationship we have split things 50/50 when we go out and stuff. I make it a point to cover the entire bill  every 1/3 times as well as buying her drinks when we are out and always getting her flowers among other things. This morning she sent me a series of texts expressing an issue with a recent purchase I made. I recently bought some new clothes for work and she said she doesn’t see why I ask her to split things 50/50 yet I spend money on myself. After letting her know that no matter how much money I make it’s important for me to have a balanced 50/50 relationship. Her text is as follows:

“Damn maybe we’re just looking for different things then. I think things can be split sometimes but you’re still the role of the man and bf and I always viewed myself as having a man who wouldn’t want me to pay for everything we do together. Even 50/50 splits are literally what friends do. “

It feels unappreciative and a spoiled response to everything but I’m not sure if I’m overreacting. I just bought us a week long trip with airfare for Christmas! We communicate decently well but am not sure how to address this. I don’t know why she is just now bringing this up this deep into the relationship or if this is a dealbreaker. Any advice on how to address this without coming at her in some attacking way?


TLDR: GF expressed she wants me to pay for more/all things, not sure if this is grounds for ending the relationship?"
11,"I(37F) finished a battle with breast cancer and only have one breast. Friend (38M) was mad and claimed I didn’t disclose soon enough.


Tl;dr: breast cancer left me with one breast temporarily. Should I disclose that to new friends and dates? 

I lost a breast to cancer and can’t have reconstruction right now. I am planning on it within the year though. They will make the remaining one smaller to match since my remaining one is very large. 

It is been a tough past 5 years but I am officially cancer free and have been for just under 6 months now. 

My therapist suggested dating and getting out and making new friends since I was feeling a little isolated. I was nervous. 

A friend of a friend of a friend actually mentioned me to a friend of theirs and he found my Instagram which is filled with pictures of me during cancer treatment and after. I do not hide at all that I am a survivor. 

He asked me a couple of days ago for my phone number. I gave it and as we were texting he never brought up the survivor thing so I didn’t mention it. He was being pretty persistent about a date while I wanted to take my time and get to know him. I made it clear I wasn’t looking for a hookup or anything. I just wanted friends. 

He asked to meet up the next day for lunch  and I thought that it sounded fun so I said yes. I have not been out with a new friend who wasn’t also a cancer survivor since the cancer started so I am deeply out of practice. That night after talking to my support group, I decided to make sure he was okay with the cancer thing as it is a big deal. He said “yeah sure why wouldn’t I be? I am a nice guy.” 

I shrugged and assumed decided I would tell him in person about the temporary one breast thing. 

We met up and I decided not to wear my prosthetic and it was noticeable. I started our conversation by mentioning it. He seemed okay with it and mentioned how his sister had breast cancer and it was a nice lunch. We split the bill as we had originally planned and I rushed back to work thinking I had a new friend. 

He sent a text almost immediately when I walked back into my office (about 10 minutes after leaving the lunch place. ) “I thought about it a lot and the one breast thing bothers me. I really wish you had disclosed it upfront so I wasn’t surprised with it. It is just not something I am okay with.” I texted back reiterating that I was just looking for friends and he had told me he was too so I am not sure why a friend having one breast would matter. After that he asked me not to contact him again and to be careful about not telling men about it going forward. I get now he probably said friend but meant “friend” but it still hurts. 

I am flabbergasted but also hurt. I wouldn’t tell a new female friend about it right at the start why would I tell him. It just seems like a private thing you would tell someone you are planning to intimate with after you get to know them. 

I am planning on starting to date soon but now I am wondering if I should hold off until I get two boobs again. 

I will admit that rejection based on making a decision that saved my life hurts way more than I am probably allowing myself to admit. He seems nice. I don’t understand why my worth as a friend and person is tied to my breast? I want to avoid that ever happening again but I don’t think I should have to tell everyone single person who talks to me that I have one breast and had cancer just to avoid them being freaked out. Is there a middle? Maybe don’t put it right out there but maybe text them privately that I have one boob? 

Is that a normal reaction or did I just get a weirdo? Should I put that on a dating profile? Or tell people right from the start? Even women? 

Tl;dr: breast cancer left me with one breast temporarily. Should I disclose that to new friends and dates before I even meet them or talk to them for an extended period? "
12,"My mother (60f) refuses to come to my(25f) wedding if I don’t allow absent father to walk w/ me down the aisle.


I’m getting married soon, my family has been supportive of this for quite some time. I was raised solely by my mom as my dad lived in a different state my entire life. Although we have a wonderful relation He has never been around physically emotionally or financially. I feel my mothers ex husband or even our priest deserve this honor as these are the men that actually raised me, helped with homework, illnesses and growing pains. My mother says if I walk the aisle alone or with anyone other than my father she will not be in attendance. Am I wrong?


I was born at an interesting time in my parents life, they were both divorced and having fun. Then whoops here I come - obviously not my fault or problem. About 8 mos after I was born my father just up and left town. My mother tried to call and reach him to no avail. My fathers first cousin was the one who informed my mother of the 2k mile move from our city. My father had not even told his own mother about me.

Over the years, my mother never bad mouthed my dad for his absence and I thank her for doing so as I grew up and developed my own opinions. Out of all my fathers children I am the only one he did not pay child support on, didn’t send anything and often times dodged phone calls from me.

I thought, my father was taking me to his family reunions as a child. Come to find out my mom was paying for his flight and ours plus paying the registration fees for HIS reunions so that I can know my family. I feel that this was my fathers responsibility to introduce his child to their family, he did not even introduce all of chia children I found them via social media after we were all already adults. I feel he should’ve taken initiative. But her strong arming the situations was a free vacation for him with benefits, do you blame him for letting her control him with her wallet? Her excuse for always footing the bills on my fathers responsibilities is her claims of my father being a broke alcoholic -there’s definitely truth to that. However, I am beginning to resent her for enabling him to be absent from my life, justify his failure to contribute emotionally physically and financially and not allowing him the choice to be involved by basically toting her purse around and being in control.

The one time I was in college and ever in my life asked my father for assistance financially; he told me he would get back with me. That was 5 years ago. But as I said previously he and I have a great relationship arguably the best out of all his children. But now I’m starting to really believe my mother is holding on to my father by me. He can never do any wrong in her eyes and she always seems to make an excuse for his short comings. What I mean is this, I still live with my mother, and if I decide hey I’m going to visit my dad for the weekend all of a sudden she’s going too - ruining my trip with my dad. She sets the tone for a fake “family trip” and basically takes my dad out on the town to casinos and bars and he and I end up spending little time together or if we do it’s with her around. To this day, I feel she is overly involved in my father and I life and relationship. For instance he has an upcoming family reunion and when in my car on Bluetooth speaking with him, she rudely interjected and  told my dad “we going, so send me the info for registration”. 

My father had no intentions upon going and hadn’t mentioned it to me. But now he’s going to go because his child’s mother is going to pay for it for him.... give me a break.

Needless to say I look at my father as cowardly considering he will not tell my mother he’s either not interested or treating her better like w real man that cares. And I resent my mother for accepting his half assed effort at treating her right, she wouldn’t be okay with a man treating me the way she’s treated by him. I feel they both are setting horrible examples for what’s acceptable behavior in a real relationship.  Needless to say I feel other men in my life have earned the right and honor to walk me down the aisle, but my mom claims she won’t allow me to “disrespect” my father like that - so she won’t be in attendance. Her absence would hurt me for years, but idk why she’s even making this HER problem to have. Their relationship doesn’t define mine... at least I thought not.

She wants to err on the side of well it’s tradition... I see giving a daughter away as a man passing his responsibilities of his daughter to another man... my father passed that responsibility off back in the 90s. Not to mention “traditionally” father of the bride paid for weddings. He has yet to offer to contribute- tho I prefer it that way just speaking on the side of “tradition” as I feel tradition is ignored accept this one aspect. I’m at a loss here .

Any thoughts? 

tl;dr my mother refuses to come to my wedding as she feels it is disrespectful of me not to allow my absent father to walk me down the aisle. Her absence would hurt me but do I give in? I thought it was my day."
13,"My [30F] girlfriend's friends make fun of her for being too stingy. Laughed at first, now it's getting a bit annoying.


My girlfriend and I have been financially independent since we finished college, we work a lot and at first, we struggled financially. Right now, we're doing better, but we're not rich or anything like that, just enough to have a more relaxed life. We both are careful with money, for example, we buy low to medium priced food, but in other areas (clothing, computers) we do spend from time to time, mostly on high-quality items. We also have money funds for emergencies, for summer holidays etc.


When her friends saw some ""stingy"" behavior ( for example buying stuff from cheaper stores a long way from home) they made jokes about it and at first, it wasn't a big deal, but it is getting annoying, also because we have helped them with small money loans in the past.

I must say, it's not a big issue or anything, but how can we put an end to this behavior in a light-hearted way?

TLDR: Me and my GF are a bit stingy with money, but never towards our families or friends. Some of them are making fun at our expense, how can we diffuse the situation?"
14,"I'm [F28] a lawyer and my new boyfriend [M30] is a carpenter. Getting sneaky comments from friends and family that I can do much better, insinuating that my boyfriend isn't educated or good enough for me.


Me and my boyfriend John have been together for 8 months now. We met at work which is a bit ironic - he was hired to help with the renovation of the building where my law firm is located and so it happened that we were around each other a lot and it just clicked, he took me out on dinner and it's been us since then.

I'll have to admit that I don't run in the same circles as someone who works as a carpenter. Most of my friends are lawyers themselves, we went to the same college, or other people I met at college. I have some childhood friends who didn't go to college and we're still in touch, but most people I encounter or hang out with are college grads. It's a really insular group, and I do wish sometimes I met people with varying backgrounds just to get another perspective on things.

Both my parents and my siblings are college grads and it's been instilled into me that I should only partner with men who have been to college or have a good career ahead of them. My sister is an engineer and she's married to a doctor, my brother is doing his phd in biology and his wife is also a phd grad. My family is extremely traditional and borgeouise and it gets on my nerves sometimes.

So, a couple of months ago I introduced John to my family. They were really awful about it, asked him a lot of mean questions and some of them were degrading and outright stupid. I could tell that he was a bit offended/taken back by my lousy parents. My mom insisted that I can do ""so much better"" and my father isn't being supportive of my relationship at all. They don't even act like John is my boyfriend. They ignore him at family events and don't go out of their way to make him feel welcomed.

My girlfriends weren't impressed when I introduced him but thankfully they've scaled down on the mean comments. 

John is a great hot guy, makes me happy, the sex is actually amazing and the best I've had so far (what to expect from a handy man), he's intelligent and we can talk about anything, makes me laugh, has surprisingly progressive views and attitudes, doesn't give a fuck that I earn more than him etc. I also like the fact that I can go home and just let go of work and not be reminded of anything having to do with my profession. I dated a lawyer right after college and it was miserable, I felt trapped. It also felt like I was dating someone just because of their job.

I just don't understand why John is being treated like this by my parents or why his job title matters so much. I couldn't give a shit about that, but I feel like most people I know are actively judging me for being together with someone that isn't at par with me career wise, and so much of these traditional gender roles are still being taken seriously. 

What should do I about this? 

Tldr: Getting sneaky comments from friends and family because I'm dating a carpenter.

15,"My [41M] sister [50F] has been in dire need of financial help for a few years. I want to provide a large amount of money to her so she can rest easier. How to bring it up to her?


My sister has always been extremely kind to me and I would like to help her financially. She took me in with her husband when I got out of college for 3 years and it helped immensely.

Her husband sadly died 6 years ago and things haven't been going all that well for her. She can assure a good level of quality of life to her daughter (the other two kids moved out), but she has debts, and without her husband's income it's been really hard for her. Her daughter is also frail health wise and that has also hit her wallet.

About a month ago we talked and she gave me a summary of her expenses and how deep in debt she is. Back then I didn't propose anything to her, but I've been thinking about it a lot, and I don't want her to live with that weight over her shoulders. If she has major emergency, she might as well be broke.

I lived with debt for years and I gotta say I don't want someone so kind and close to me to suffer through that while also caring for her child.

I am willing to give her what she needs to be debt-free, which is a few 10Ks. I talked to my wife a few times and we agreed that I would do it with my own savings.

So now the deal is to tell my sister about it. She *never* allows me to pay for her. She's a dentist and she covers my family's needs for absolutely free. The first time she did it to my daughter I was about to pay her and she laughed and said ""Oh, shut up"". Also, I don't want to come off as ""saving"" her or anything similar. I don't want to be condescending, I just ideally would like her to accept it and breathe a little easier from now on.

I don't know if I am out of place in what I am doing? I think I am not, but still. How should I approach it? How can I frame it in a way that is appropriate?

**tl;dr:** Sister is in need of financial help. I want to provide what she needs to be debt-free but don't know if shew will accept or how to ask her. I just want her to be more financially stable for her and her child. How can I handle this in a way that is appropriate and doesn't come off as condescending or anything else?"
16,"My boyfriend [25m] always talked badly about his ex [24f], who had his child [8f]. I [22f] met her by coincidence and she seems lovely.


My boyfriend Marc used to  date a girl, Jen, in high school. He got her pregnant and she kept the kid, with custody over her. She and her parents took care of the baby girl. He paid child support and still is.

He always talked badly about her, saying she was a liar, immature, manipulative, she really messed up his life in high school and through college when he was trying to make things work between them. I never really had a reason to doubt him. Until he and I moved to the town he grew up in. 

I went to the climbing gym there, and met a girl who works there named Jennifer, she was a single mom and she was just starting college a little late in life because she'd been raising a kid through the second half of high school. She seemed really lovely, and I didn't make the connection between her and Marc's ex. They looked totally different, I'd seen pictures of Marc's ex and she had waist length black hair and was a little chubby. And the girl from the climbing gym was lean and strong with very short red hair.

After a couple of times hanging out with at the climbing gym with a bunch of people, I told Marc about all my new acquaintances from there, and how I'd like to be better friends with them. Because I was new in town and wanted to make new friends. I mentioned that there was a girl Jennifer who is really talented climber, and she's also going to college and raising a little girl, and I was impressed by how hardworking she was!

He asked ""are you fucking kidding me"" and I was so confused. He said that I was talking about his asshole ex, and he didn't believe me that I didn't make the connection. He thought I was trying to pick a fight or make drama or something. I said I absolutely wasn't trying to start an argument, and from what I'd seen she seemed lovely so I seriously hadn't made the connection between her and the ""awful"" ex.

He got really annoyed that I said she seemed lovely, and started reminding me of the stuff she'd done in high school. And I was just like ""Don't you think people can change between 16 and 24?"" 

He also asked if I was going to keep hanging out with Jennifer, and I said I was going to keep going to the gym, and definitely not avoid my hobby because of her. And I should probably mention to her that I was dating the father of her kid, to avoid that being a shock sometime later. 

He was really bothered by that, by how I wanted to talk to her and get everything out in the open. Like I cared more about her comfort than his. I really just wanna be able to go to the gym and not make it awkward though.

I've also been feeling a little shook up by seeing that Jennifer acts nothing like I expected from what Marc said about her. I'm wondering if there's a lot of unfounded resentment on his side, for her having kept the baby?

I don't know what to think about all this. Am I right to be this shaken up?

tldr; my boyfriend always talked about his ex, who had his child, really badly. I met her by coincidence and she seems lovely. I'm feeling shaken up."
17,"My fiancée (24M) cannot get an interview or a call back from a job...... and I’m (25F) about to land the job of his dreams.


There’s a lot of backstory here. 

Fiancée moved across the country to live with me and has been doing temp jobs for over a year. Absolutely cannot get a call back from a “real” job, partially because he only ever worked in retail before graduating. He absolutely despises his current job. 

I’ve been employed since it was legal, and have had incredibly good luck landing positions that gave me great experience or made it seem like I had it. Recently I was laid off at work and while I’m having trouble dealing with it, fiancée has been more than supportive. 

But now we’re both looking for jobs. And we have many of the same interests, and thus are applying to the same jobs (I asked him if this would hurt his feelings and he said “I mean, you’re actually unemployed right now so I would hope you’d get it instead of me, but I’d be bummed”).

We both applied to different but similar jobs at a small company that just oozes our values. He was just telling me he hasn’t gotten word back after a week and I let him know it’s still possible! 

I got an email to set up an appointment after two days. 

I don’t want him to resent me, and I don’t want to give up this really awesome opportunity. It just sucks. He’s been searching for jobs on and off for A YEAR and I got a legitimate interview in less than a week. What can I do to soothe his ego or at least be less irritating about it?

TLDR my fiancée has been searching for jobs forever and I got a great interview in less than a week. I’m worried he’s going to resent me "
18,"I [30M] may have ruined Valentines Day and my relationship [30F] by arguing with a waitress [F]


Jesus this is a long story, sorry.  I didn't want to leave anything out.  Theres a lot of moving pieces.

&amp;#x200B;

I live in an upscale suburb of a major city.  We live just far enough from the city to have a nice, small, tight-knit community.  But not far enough that we don't still get plenty of day tourists (which is good for the economy).  

&amp;#x200B;

I've built a nice life here.  I've been here since college (7 years) because I got a job about 1/2 way to the city and I enjoyed the area.  I'm Black, and the city has very few Black people, but I've always felt welcomed and that has never bothered me.  I only point that out because I stick out.  The other characteristics of my look is distinct regardless of race, so that coupled with being one of the few Black people here means people remember my interactions moreso than they would with anyone else.  I'm also active in the community so I meet lots of people.  

I've been dating Janet for a couple of months.  She's lived here for about a decade; a little longer than me.  We've only been seeing each other for 4 months so for Valentines Day we decided we wanted to do something low-key, just a nice dinner and movie at home.  Nothing too extravagant.  

&amp;#x200B;

We went to a nice restaurant downtown.  Packed, obviously, but I made a res.  I ran into multiple people I knew just from the community stuff I participate in.  Plus, this restaurant is my go-to for dates anyway so a lot of the people that work here know me.  We ate, and had a few glasses of wine.  A nice meal.  I got the bill, I did not pay attention to the details.  I saw about $50 for food, and $30 for drinks.  Makes sense.  Its a little lower than I expected but its not like I tabulated the bill in my head as we were ordering stuff.  I dropped a $100 bill in the sleeve and we headed out.  

&amp;#x200B;

As we were walking out, I did hear a bit of commotion in the back (someone yelling something).  The restaurant is packed, its pretty loud regardless, and there is a massive line, so I paid it no mind.  I DID hear something about ""dine and ditch"" as I opened the front door.  

&amp;#x200B;

Now I'm standing in the front smoking a cigarette before we get in the car, and doing cute stuff with Janet.  All of a sudden the Manager and a bus boy (not sure if thats the right term anymore, but he cleans up tables after people eat) come outside and ask me if I'm leaving.  I'm like, yeah, we're about to go, thanks for everything.  I've seen both of them before.  The bus boy a lot because he works there and I've been there plenty of times.  He's a big kid.  Played HS football as a linemen locally.  I played in college.  I know his older brother.  I been to their moms house.  I know the Manager through his SO who I see often through community events.  The Manager tells me that our waitress claimed I didn't pay our bill.  I tell him thats bullshit.  My first thought is that the waitress stole my $100 dollar bill and is trying to get me fucked.  I just ask if they have cameras, and he says yes.  So I say lets just go in the back and check the camera so we can see me pay my bill.  On the way back inside I look at the bus boy and ask wtf is goin on?  He shrugs his shoulders.  I respond, ""Me and you have a real fuckin issue if you think that I would steal from you guys.""  I admit that was aggressive.  But I know this kid and I know his family, our relationship is close.  I can talk to him like that with no long term issues.  I'm hurt about the situation, and the fact that he's on the other side.  Its not his fault, though.  

&amp;#x200B;

To be clear, I hate thieves.  If you call me a thief we are going to have a problem, because I hate thieves.  We walk back to the table, and the waitress is waiting there with the bill folder in her hand.  As we walk back the entire restaurant is looking at us.  I see more than 1 person holding up a phone, which makes me obviously think we're being recorded as some ""dine and ditchers"" that got caught.  She immediately starts saying I owe her money.  I'm like wtf?  I gave you $100 dollar bill.  She says thats not enough.  Right then, the table sitting right next to us says, ""hold on...this is not our bill.""  What happened was our table and the table right next to us both got their bills at the same time, and the waitress accidentally switched them up.  They sat around after their meal to finish their drinks so they didn't look at it.  Thankfully they actually looked at the details because their bill came out to be more than they expected.  That is an honest mistake.  Our waitress mistakenly gave the wrong table their bills.  I also made a mistake by not checking my bill before I paid.  Turns out my bill should have been $102 instead of $82.  

&amp;#x200B;

I was still heated.  I spoke loudly as I explained that its not my fault I received the wrong bill.  I am from a culture which tends to speak louder in these types of situations.  I paid the bill I was given, and gave a fair tip.  Both bills had 2 meals.  Both bills had pasta and steak for the meals.  Both bills had wine.  I simply didn't study the details and didn't realize the difference.  I didn't appreciate what I considered an over-reaction.  Our waitress literally screamed out that we were trying to steal.  She got the Manager and the biggest bus boy there to find us in the parking lot.  We had to walk back to our table with everyone thinking we tried to dine and ditch.  I had met like 10% of the people in there, and another 40% probably knew of me through friends/family.  Plus, I'm the only Black dude that looks like me in the town.  It is highly embarrassing for her to make everyone think I ran out on my bill, and considering people also got me on film it would be hard to re-build my image.  

&amp;#x200B;

I threw another $10 on the bill to cover the difference.  This means the tip was much lower.  The waitress looked at me and said, ""are you serious?  thats it?""  I lost it.  I saw Janet pull out her purse to give her more money but I shot her the dirtiest look of all time.  It was my ""don't you dare give her more money"" look.  The money is not the issue.  I had a stack on me as fun money because of other reasons.   I replied, ""yes, i'm serious.  what the fuck are you talking about?  you embarrass me and think i'm going to reward you?  you literally told the entire restaurant i tried to steal our meal.  the only reason i have any tip at all is for the bus boys and the chef.""  The audacity of someone questioning the amount of my tip after that.  I made sure to get a receipt, then we left.  

&amp;#x200B;

We left.  Janet was really quiet in the car.  I assumed it was because she has never seen me stand up like that.  I was standing up for us.  When we got to her place she said she wasn't feeling it anymore and just wanted to go to sleep.  She thought that I was too mean to the waitress because I cursed at her while I was talking to her and I gave her a bad tip.  We are both minorities, but she is definitely from a culture that is more quiet and reserved while I'm from a culture that is more loud and aggressive.  For me, altercations aren't a big deal.  You have them, you get over them.  No one holds a grudge.  She is from a more quiet culture in which they don't do things like that.  She also, as far as I have seen, tends to...bow down to people that have done her dirty.  In this specific situation she would have just liked to come inside, said nothing, pay the difference, and leave.

&amp;#x200B;

I have to start skipping details because this is too long.  

&amp;#x200B;

We still havent really spoken to each other since.  I have called down to the restaurant and talked to the Manager.  He 100% backs me up.  He told me if he had known that I was only $2 short on my ""bill"" then he wouldn't have even said anything, he would have just talked to me the next time I came in.  He also said he also talked to the waitress about her reaction to me ""skipping out on the bill"" when that wasn't the case at all.  He said next time I came in, whatever bottle I want is on the house.  

&amp;#x200B;

I told this to Janet, but her response was, ""did you apologize to the waitress?""  I'm like no, because I'm not sure what I should apologize for.  She said getting angry and poorly tipping.  I just said I didn't feel the same way and we haven't spoken since although I have texted her twice about some memes since with no response.  

&amp;#x200B;

I'm not sure how to save this relationship at this point.  I could apologize to the waitress, but as of right now I feel like ""fuck that.""   Maybe I'm just too ""hood"" to be dating Janet?  Thats really sad to me because I don't think I am.  I'm allowed to get upset when I'm HIGHLY offended, right?  I'm extremely confused.

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR : Should I apologize to a waitress who embarrassed me in front of my community just to appease my girlfriend?  Or should I hold strong?  I want to be with her.

19,"Me [25F] with my sister [29F]. Sister told everyone I was on hard drugs when I was actually really sick


I don't even know where to start.

For years, I was having these weird health problems; I couldn't sleep, was anemic, had horrible pains in my lower abdomen, and could barely eat because of the pain. I saw many doctors, and none knew what was going on with me. I was told it might all be due to a gluten-intolerance or lactose-intolerance, and to change my diet (which I then did but it still didn't fix my issues). 

Due to my health going to shit, I started spending more time at home, and was forced to miss many family events. When my family did see me, I looked like ass; super skinny, big black circles under my eyes, and just generally looked like shit. I also changed my diet around. They thought how could I be gluten-intolerant when I ate gluten my whole life with no problems. My family thought I was just being difficult. 

At one point a few years ago, I was with my sister heading to my mom's birthday in her car. She asked me what was going on with me, and I said I wasn't feeling well and was having some health problems. She said straight up she didn't believe me, and implied it was because I was on hard drugs. I do smoke weed, but do no other drugs. My sister is religious, so I just assumed she was paranoid. We were about to go to my mom's birthday, so I just let it go.

A little while after the birthday party (months), I had to call my sister about something. I can't remember the context, but I think it had something to do with me bailing on another family event. I over heard her husband say in the background in front of their kids "" she'd come over if we had drugs"". I was like "" what did he say?"", and she was like, "" Oh he was just joking..."" Even if he was joking, this type of joke pissed me right off, because it was in front of their kids. 

My sister eventually stopped letting me see her kids. Anytime I asked if I could babysit them, she'd make up an excuse to not have them over. One time we had arranged for me and my boyfriend to take her 8 year old daughter and 5 year old son for a day of painting canvases, and she called me up the night before saying her husband had to do an oil change the next day and had no time (really? of all excuses she uses something that takes under 15 mins). I was pissed because I just went out the day before to buy a bunch of painting supplies for the kids. This incident became one of many.

Fast forward to 2019; I recently found out that these health problems were due to a benign tumour the size of a grapefruit that was lodge in uterus, but was pushing on my intestines, bladder and other organs. I am due for surgery in a few months. Once I found this out, I told my mom, who then told my sister. My sister texts me, interrogating me like she can't believe I actually have real health problems, and if it was really that big why is my surgery months away and not weeks or days? I had enough of her shit and called her out on it. I said "" I'm getting the vibe you don't believe me"" then I sent her a pic of the paper work showing the mass inside me was 11x10 cms. Then she goes "" Oh, so you really are sick"". Then I said "" are you sure you believe me, and you don't think I'm on hard drugs?"" Then I reminded her of our conversation in the car before my mom's birthday. She completely denies that conversation ever took place. She said she couldn't remember saying that, and if she did she was just joking. I was like, how is saying I'm on hard drugs a joke (btw, nothing about her tone in the car implied it was a joke. She was dead serious). 

The damage didn't just stop at her family, she convinced my parents I was even on hard drugs. And they still don't believe me! They're literally waiting for me to have the surgery in order to be convinced I'm actually sick. 

I do have mild aspergers, but I feel as though she's taking advantage of this and is gaslighting me. My boyfriend even agrees she's gaslighting (he's my voice of reason in times when I really don't know). 

I'm sick and tired of my family's bullshit. I was at my worst, and all she did was kick me while I was down. The fact she can't even own what she did makes me want to cut her off (how can we fix our relationship when she can't own her actions?). She manipulated my parents, who then told my aunts and uncles even. The whole damn family thinks I'm on hard drugs. I have no relationship with her kids, because she keeps them away from me. The only time I'm allowed to see her kids, is at family events with the entire family, which happens on a yearly basis. 

Is this a valid reason to cut her off? I feel like cutting my parents off too because they still don't believe me. What's the point of having a family if they don't support you, and just accuse you of things you aren't even doing? I'm the only one in my family that isn't religious, and because of it they are teaming up against me. 

tldr: Family thinks I'm on hard drugs because my sister told them I was when I was sick. My relationship with my family is so damaged now, I'm tempted to cut them all off.

20,"Is there a tactful way for me (56f) to talk to my son (30m) about keeping the volume down during sex?


Due to circumstances I (56f) ended up moving in with my son (30m), his wife (29f) and my granddaughter (2f). They are helping me out, and I try to pitch in anyway I can, I try to give them their space, buy groceries, babysit, etc. They are doing me a favour and I recognize this.

They live in a smallish house, a 2 bedroom bungalow with a basement, I’m in the basement, it’s comfortable and I’m so thankful for the accommodations.

The point of this post is that almost every night they put my granddaughter to bed, then they go to bed shortly after and almost every night I hear them having sex. I get it, they’re married, it’s their home. It’s a good thing and I know this. The only problem is that they are so loud. I’ve started taking their dog out for a walk every night so I can avoid having to hear it. I’m sure they probably think since I’m in the basement I can’t hear them. If I hear them, then I’m sure my granddaughter does too.

Is there a tactful way to address this? Or do I just keep walking the dog every night?

TL:DR- is there a tactful way for me (56f) to talk to son (30m) about keeping the volume down when he has sex with his wife (29f) or just suck it up?"
21,"I [25F) can't get over the fact that my boyfriend [26M] of 2 years told me that my now-colleague is the only ""10"" he knows of


Short backround: Me and John met at uni during our bachelor's degree. He was in a relationship with someone else until the last year and we started dating abount 6 months after that. I have never been this happy in a relationship before and we're on the same page about everything regarding future plans. I honestly feel like I'm behaving super silly, but given how long it's been I think I need some outside perspective. 


This conversation happened almost 2 years ago. At the time, we weren't official yet, but had been dating for a while and were on our first vacation together. We were talking about looks in general and as a game, he asked me to rate myself on a scale from 1-10 and I in turn, asked him back. Then he asked who I thought was a 10. I've always thought that the only people who are tens are celebrities (because they get paid to look good plus photoshopped and what not), I just mentioned one or two. I of course asked him back and he said ""Well, I think Julie is a definite 10"". So my heart sinks, because Julie was also in our class. I never knew her that well, a couple of conversations over the years, but she was never that involved in after-class activities or anything. And, as it happens, I had previously picked up on the fact that he seemed annoyed about the fact that she never joined the social stuff. As I aspire to approach situations as drama-less and logical as possible, I just say that I agreed that she is good looking. The thought nagged at me for a long while, but I decided to try and ignore it as best as possible while knowing that there we just had a few months left until summer and everyone had their degree. 

In the fall I started my awesome job. There were two positions available when I applied, and guess who got the other one? YES you are correct, it was Julie. So now, we are colleagues and I see her every-damn-day. She's nice and we get along well. But the fact that I have to see here everyday ends up in me comparing us, and I am so annoyed with myself for it. And like 2-4 times a month, I'm in bed, and the comment pops into my head and my heart sinks. 

So a few months ago, after a couple (a lot) of drinks and our first real discussion about something unrelated, but sort of tangent, so I brought it up. Keep in mind, things were a bit heated due to the other discussion. I said something along the lines of ""I know this might be stupid to bring up, as there isn't really anything you can do about it, but it's been bothering me."" And after I explained he looked me in the eye said ""Well, I can't do anything about that, I think Julie is the perfect ten"". Sooo, let's just say that didn't help. 


So, I've obiviously though about this a lot and I think one of the main reasons this is nagging at me in the degree it is, is that I've never been one to focus too much on looks. I do my make-up in like 5 minutes and just put clothes on without much thought. Its honestly something I've always prided myself on, considering the people I hung around with while growing up, who did care a lot. John however, cares about looks. And this is also the first relationship I'm in where I'm honestly afraid that I'm the party with more feelings than the other. Which was exacerbated by the fact that I had to push for us to become official due to him saying it wasn't really that important being official and because he felt it was a very short time after his relationship with his ex ended. 


So kind people of reddit, please give me some advice on how to forget this or handle it in a better way than I'm doing now. 


tldr: my boyfriend told me another girl, who was a classmate of us at the time and is now my colleague, was the only perfect ten he knew of. "
22,"My (M41) sister in law (F45) went full crazy on me because I allowed my children to have cake at a family gathering while her daughter has celiac and couldn't eat it -but had brought her own not so nice cake- and I wouldn't budge.


Imo the whole thing's stupid but I'm not budging since is a matter of principle for me. We had a family gathering today to celebrate my daughter getting over her fear of water and having had her first swimming lesson this past weekend. We invited our direct family and as usual we consulted with my sister in law because her daughter has celiac, so like we do everytime we call her mom and tell notify her what food we're gonna cook to make sure everything's ok for my niece to eat.

We told her we had were gonna order a cake and asked if she knew of any shops where they sell gluten free cakes that her daughter maybe has tried in the past and likes. She said her daughter is on a diet and can't really eat cake, but just so she doesn't feel left out she'll bring a homemade cupcake herself so she can eat it when everybody else eats cake. So she gives us a thumbs up to order the cake we want.


For the record, my niece is 13 and her mom is a bit obsessed (IMO) with projecting her issues on her, pushing her to be thin and other shit that I don't think is normal to push onto a kid.

So anyway, all's good, we go to our local bakery and let my kid pick up the cake she wants, with gluten since my niece is not gonna have any.

Today we all meet up for lunch, we're having a great time and when we finish eating and bring out the cake my sister's in law jaw dropped and said she didn't know we were gonna buy such a nice looking cake and though we'd get something more basic. 

So now she asks my wife and I for a quick word in the kitchen, she proceeds to tell us that it's not fair that we're rubbing that cake on her daughter's face when all she brought was a cupcake which isn't in the same league as the cake, and if she'd known she'd have told us to buy an equally cool looking gluten free cake.

So in her mind we have to take the cake back to the kitchen so my niece doesn't feel left out and nobody can have cake. 

My wife told asked to please not make a scene and reminded her we asked her and even insisted in us buying a gluten free cake but she was the one being very strict about her daughter's diet and bringing a cupcake just so she wouldn't feel left out.

She then had a go at my wife saying she's always one upping her which isn't true, it's a fucking cake ffs. I told her I didn't appreciate her giving my wife shit in our own home and that my kids and the rest of the family were gonna eat that cake because there was no chance I was gonna deprive my kids of the cake I promised them just because she thought we'd buy a  crappy cake and we bought a pretty nice one. 

Why should my kids pay just because of the weird concept she had in her head? After going with them to the shop and letting my kid pick the one she liked amd I supposed to tell her she can't have her cake because her aunt thinks it's too pretty and my niece can't have a piece? 

Even her own daughter heard us arguing in the kitchen and came over to say she couldn't care less about the cake and just wanted to finish eating and go upstairs with my kids to play with the play station.

So out of principle I got the cake out, then my SIL got pissed, grabbed her daughter and left. My wife ran after her begging her to not make a scene because we were having such a good time all together but she got in her car and left. 

About an hour ago she sent my wife a text saying the only way we can work through this is if I apologize to her. I do not want to apologize because I'm not in the wrong and my wife's got my back. But at the same time my kids love playing with my niece and I don't want them to lose the relationship they have just because I'm stubborn.

**TL;DR** Sister in law got mad over a cake I bought because her daughter has celiac and couldn't eat it, even though we agreed she'd bring her own cake.

23,"Height/Size difference... how to be ok with it?


I [28F] am dating a lovely guy [28M]. We met online and I didn’t ask him his height though he did bring it up to tell me he was “short” and he asked my height I responded and he said he was roughly the same height ... I said that I would still like to meet.

When we met I was surprised that he was shorter, I imagined we’d be a little closer in height given the earlier messages. I understand that it’s probably an insecurity of his, and maybe past experiences have made him weary of revealing his exact height. We haven’t discussed it more than that one text exchange and I don’t feel there’s a need to talk about it. 

He’s great, I find him really attractive, funny, interesting etc... all good things! The problem is with me- I’m bigger/curvier/fat (however you want to call it). He is of average build. Often I have been the wider partner but I have never been the taller AND wider partner. This is making me feel really uncomfortable in my own skin, I feel that the size difference makes me look even bigger and I feel terrible. I can’t say this to him, and there’s no reason- there’s nothing he can do, though I suppose I could lose weight but it will take time. 

If people are looking at us, I assume it’s because they’re thinking I’m some sort of obese giant person. I’m 5’6 so not super tall but a few inches taller than my ‘love interest’. I was wondering if anyone has been in a similar situation and has overcome this feeling? I would really like this to work. Any advice would be much appreciated!

tl;dr for the first time taller and wider than my partner how to become comfortable being the bigger partner"
24,"Co-worker's (44M) son (18M) is behaving strangely around me (38M). I don't know what to make of it?


Some background info: I work for a small marketing and PR agency. It's a ""chill"" environment and I'm quite friendly with my colleagues. It's also not unusual for family members or friends to come visit during lunch hours or near the end of workday.

One of my co-workers has a son whom I had a chance to meet last month. He came to the office after school to drop off something for his dad and stuck around for a bit. Co-worker introduced us and showed the kid around the office. Then he mentioned how the son was interested in studying economics and finance this year, which was incidentally my major. We had a brief discussion about it, and talked about my old college where he was applying.

At some point, the kid noticed the photo of me and my husband (42M) I keep on my desk and kept staring at it. I just smiled and explained who that was, cracked a joke about the vacation where that was taken. He laughed awkwardly and seemed kind of distracted or confused. I told the kid and his dad that if they had any more questions about the college, they knew where to find me.

To be frank, I was being polite and didn't expect the kid to actually contact me, especially since so much has changed since my graduation. However, a few days later, I received a message request on Facebook. It was from my colleague's son and I thought it was a little strange of him to reach out to me there. However, his question concerned the college application, so I accepted the request and gave him an honest ""No clue"" answer, but shared with him a contact obtained through a friend of mine who works for the college administration.

I figured kids just preferred communicating through social media in general and pushed the whole thing to the back of my mind for awhile.

Then the messages started... He would send me random articles, memes or funny videos every other day. It was a little bizarre and I don't understand if he was trying to get my attention? I asked him if he had any more questions, but he responded ""no"" and asked me what I thought of some video he'd sent me. I started feeling somewhat queasy and left most of this stuff unread, hoping he would give up. However, when he saw I was ignoring him, he started purposefully messaging me more often.

I told my husband about it, and he said the kid was probably bored and pulling pranks, advised me to just delete the conversation. So I did, and I figured if he ever needed any more information about his studies, he could ask me through his father. I didn't accept any further message requests.

Just this week, the kid came to our office again. He was friendly towards me and actually apologized for the messages. I told him it was no big deal, but that it'd be better to reach me at work or through his dad (frank talk: I just didn't want to engage in any more private messaging with my co-worker's 18yo). He agreed and sat by a computer next to me while waiting for his dad. He told me about a response he got about the application question, then suddenly shifted the topic to my home life. He asked me where and how I met my husband, if we had any kids and what my family thought of him. Then he talked about someone he was texting, but complained how they were ""flaky""... I had to Google this one. It was only after he and his dad had left that I realized he might have been using gender-neutral pronouns on purpose.

Later that day, I had a conversation with my husband and he suggested the kid might be gay or bisexual and trying to connect with me. Or in the worst-case scenario, he might be having an inappropriate crush... The latter was a friend's conclusion, but I don't think so? Perhaps he's just someone who's curious about his dad's colleagues, but that sounds weird even as I type it. I noticed he sent me another message request, along with a friend request this time. I don't really want to accept it, as I'm not comfortable communicating with my co-worker's kid in this manner. However, I'm not sure what the best move is, and what this whole situation even means?

Tl;dr: Co-worker's 18-year-old son is trying to send me private messages on Facebook and is curious about my home life. Husband suggests the kid might be trying to connect with me because I'm gay. I'm not sure if that's the case and how to appropriately deal with this?"
25,"I [32F] am starting to consider breaking off my engagement with my [35M] significant other of 4.5 years because I feel like a fraud.


Hello Reddit, My S/O and I have been together about 4.5 years, living together 2.5 years. We recently got engaged about 6 months ago, and I don’t know if I’m just getting cold feet or if my feelings are valid.

My significant other hardly helps around the house. I have discussed this issue with him nearly every week since moving in together. We have tried chore charts, setting reminders, me nagging him constantly (his request), and we started couples counseling about a month ago and this issue has been a fairly hot topic at therapy. His only chores are washing and drying laundry (I fold and put away) and vacuuming our bedroom twice a week. I don’t feel this is asking a lot as I do literally everything else. He often leaves his dirty dishes on his nightstand so there is hardened food that makes doing dishes suck even more. He also leaves dirty socks and shirts on the floor and when he’s hungry he assumes I’m going to make him something. It’s not uncommon for him to leave candy wrappers and energy drink cans everywhere. He will put trash on the counter next to the trash can so he doesn’t have to change it. And when he does he just puts the bag next to the back door instead of opening the door and putting it in the dumpster one foot outside the door. This is a guy that claims to be a huge feminist and gets upset about any inequality but for some reason refuses to actually be about that life. I feel like a total fraud and hypocrite because how can I call myself a feminist when I put up with this shit? I’ve cooked every meal, do 95% of the chores, and take care of his cat (he will let the litter box go for weeks at a time).

I hate coming home now. I work in a math lab at a college and I’m also a student myself and have days that start at 6am and end at 10pm. I am beyond exhausted. Lately when I come home after a long day and see the house in disarray I just start crying. I spend most of my time in our bedroom as it’s the only room I have time to keep organized and clean. I used to love my job and going to college but lately I just feel like it’s another burden. It’s amazing how fast the house falls apart too. I’ll spend a few hours cleaning on the weekend and in a couple days you couldn’t even tell I did anything at all.

I can’t do this forever and I have no idea how to get through to him. We have therapy tonight and I think I’m going to ask to see her alone instead and pick her brain for the kindest way to break off the engagement without hurting him significantly. I still love this man very much, but I cannot marry him feeling this way and I don’t want to string anyone along.

He gets upset when I do his chores for him yet when he doesn’t do his chores and I wait I’m left with no clean clothes. I’ve recently lost 50 pounds so I have a very limited wardrobe and need laundry done every few days or so. I’ve actually had to wear dirty clothes to class and work because he got pissed when I tried to do laundry but then he didn’t do it either. I feel like I’m taking crazy pills.

He does work full time and he pays half of the bills. He’s very sweet and we used to have a lot of fun together. When I spend time with him now I just feel resentful. All I see is a man-baby. I don’t want a baby, I want a partner. I no longer really want to have sex with him and most nights I tell him to play video games so I can just be alone and not have to pour any more energy into anything.

I thought about going to my moms to stay for a couple of days to be in an environment that makes me more comfortable and to try to decompress and get my head right. Therapy hasn’t really changed anything and after six sessions I feel like I’m just wasting even more of my time.

Am I overreacting or making a mistake for even considering breaking things off? Is there any way to get through to him?

Thank you for reading, any advice is welcome.

TL;DR - My fiancé doesn’t help around the house and I’m considering breaking off our engagement. "
26,"My bf [27M] prioritises everything over me [25F], he thinks I’m just selfish


we’ve been together for 4 years and we’ve had a lot of ups and downs through the years. One of the common issues we have is that John often doesn’t seem to value my feelings or presence or time. It seems I’m just something that can work around him and what he wants. 

I will talk about his dog but I want to point out that I don’t have an issue with his dog, I love the dog myself however John seems to prioritise him a lot over us. In the last 4 years we have not been able to take any trips together because John would rather spend his time off with his dog. 

I love hiking, I look for dog friendly hikes but his dog is scared of every little odd crack and step meaning when we attempt he gets scared and refuses to move. Despite this, John insists either his dog comes or he won’t go. Then we’ll drive all the way there and right at the start his dog will refuse to continue, we’ll sit around an hour or two waiting for his dog to change its mind, then return back home. 


John has no issues doing things on his own without his dog, he regularly goes out to play Pokémon several hours at a time without the dog and yet when it comes to us doing things he restricts everything. 



Now on to our current problem. We’ve been long distance for a few months now, a decision John made on his own (long story but we broke up due to this as I felt I meant nothing to him, he tried convincing me otherwise and got us back together ) 


John recently asked if I would go on a small mountain holiday with him. He wants it to be dog friendly and involve the snow. I’m happy with both. We make rough plans. He wants me to look into hotels and activities. 


I tell him I can only do 5 days with work being hectic, he says

 “ fine, you can leave after 5, me and Clara will stay for 7 days “

Me: “ how will I get back on my own, wouldn’t we be going together” 

Him “ F # off I’m not driving you, you can drive yourself there and leave when you want. 


I get upset at this point, and I try telling him my feelings - that saying this makes me feel like I’m just a third wheel and doesn’t feel like we are taking this trip together. He starts Yelling, says I have no right to be upset as all he did was agree with what I wanted which was that I wanted to stay for 5 days. The more I try explaining how given our past - this- although petty and small thing has made me feel worthless yet again. But he just got mad and hung up on me instead. 


I feel like if my presence doesn’t mean anything why am i even going. If he wants to take this trip on his own, he can. I told him this too. Why not take the trip with your own dog and leave me out of it. He’s not happy with that response either and is calling me crazy, immature child. He’s basically done nothing but insult me since. 


I don’t know anymore. The more I try explaining myself the worse it becomes. I feel so pathetic. Is it really that awful to want to matter to someone who supposedly loves me. I’m not even asking him to prioritise me over his dog or other things that he clearly values more, I just want the same thoughtfulness he has towards them. 


How unreasonable am I being and am I really that selfish ? 


Tldr; bf seems to value pretty much everything above me, he won’t let us break up as he claims he loves me too much however when it comes to showing some care he fails every time and leads to calling me crazy, selfish among other insults. I’m so tired of feeling so pathetic

27,"Husband 50 M and myself 40 F , 5 years in relationship, married for 3. He had secret vasectomy, should I leave him for this betrayal?


My husband 50M had a secret vasectomy 10 years ago while he was married to his first wife. When we met 5 years ago he never disclosed this information and we got married 3 years ago. We have been trying to have a baby, obviously without any luck until we opted to do IVF in Dec 2018 which was unsuccessful. Last month I looked at all our tests results and it hit me that his zero sperm count several times on sperm analysis can’t be normal and suspected vasectomy. I confronted him about it and he admitted he had vasectomy and was hoping it will reverse itself naturally hence he never said anything.

I feel very angry, betrayed and hurt that he allowed me to go through the emotional roller coaster of thinking I’m infertile and to even suggest IVF while he knew what the problem for us not falling pregnant was his vasectomy. It is difficult to trust him now. Should I stay or is should I divorce him and get someone who will be honest with me and who I know I’ll still have children with. I feel cheated and time is against me. I’m very conflicted on what to do, please advice.

TLDR husband 50 M had secret vasectomy. Should I leave him?"
28,"My (27f) boyfriend (38m) has been seeing his estranged wife (~36f) behind my back.


Dan and I have been together for nearly a year and a half. We have lived together since August, I met his parents at Thanksgiving, and he met my children during Christmas. We are very happy and talking about a wedding and children of our own. Now I don't know.

On our very first date, I asked him if he was married because I had no interest in being the other woman. He said he was married but had been separated for several months with a divorce coming up shortly. I trusted him.

We were long distance for almost a year before he asked me to move in with him. I travel a lot for work still, but we both want to settle down. Long distance is hard, we saw each other once or twice a month, and I decided to give him all of my trust and love.

A last October we went on a trip to Washington state together. We have a high-maintenance dog we usually leave with friends. They were all busy so he informed me that he was going to leave our dog with his (still not ex) wife, Tammy. I wasn't even aware they were still speaking.

I told him I was uncomfortable with him going to her apartment alone and asked him to meet her at a park nearby. He hesitated and then said he would meet her in public to make me more comfortable.

I don't think this is an unreasonable request, especially considering that I go to great lengths to make sure I'm never alone with my ex, the father of my children. I will tuck the kiddos in bed and then drive 30+ minutes to my mom's house, then wake up at 5:30 and make the trip back so I can be there when they wake up for school. Dan has asked me not to text my ex directly, but to only communicate with him through our group chat. I've complied to make him comfortable.

He promised me he would meet her in public and contact me when he arrived and when he left. I trusted him.

Fast forward to yesterday. I got a friend request from one of Dan's friends and accepted it. Apparently he knows Tammy too. I popped up in her ""Suggested Friends,"" me and my profile picture of me kissing Dan.

She messaged me. The message's tone was that of an elder sister giving a warning. She said she didn't know Dan was seeing someone, that they weren't separated till November 2018, which as you know, was a few months after we moved in together. She told me they were going on trips together and spending time together. She informed me they spent Super Bowl Sunday at her apartment, by themselves. This was while I was on a business trip. She sent photos of them to back up these claims.

Tammy texted Dan to let him know she was contacting me, so he approached me about it. I couldn't breathe. I just sat there shaking. She swears they were sleeping together on a lot of these trips. He swears that they he hasn't slept with her since before we met. At this point I don't know if I care if they were sleeping together. He was basically with her every time I was out of town earning money for us to buy our first house. And he never said a word. He always said he was doing something else.

I went all in on this guy. He is begging for me to give him another chance. Sobbing, on his knees, the whole 9 yards. But I don't know. I still have to travel. He has offered to let me see his phone. He has offered to give me the passwords to the cameras on his business and our apartment so I can see when he comes and goes. I have no interest in being a nanny girlfriend.

I am heartbroken. I feel shattered. I don't know if I can rebuild the trust he broke.

Someone please help me play devil's advocate here. Am I being unreasonable? Am I being blind? I'm so confused.

tl:dr My boyfriend has been sneaking visits to his ""ex"" wife while I'm on business trips and lying about it. She got in touch with me to make sure I was fully informed. I don't know what to do."
29,"I (30f) didn’t show up to my mother’s (52f) funeral and now everyone is upset with me.


Let me start out by saying I haven’t spoken to my mother in 12 years since I turned 18 and here’s a list of reasons why: 

- physical and verbal abuse (slapping me, abusing me when I cried since I wasn’t allowed to cry, choking me, beating me with a belt everywhere on my body, sitting me down and listing out all my flaws for hours, calling me names, telling me dead family members would be disgusted with me, no one would ever want me, etc) 

- scolded me after I tried to commit suicide at 13 (right there in the hospital bed) and blackmailed me for years to tell my “secret” to my biological father or people at my school as I didn’t want them to find out about my attempt

- didn’t allow me to leave the house unless it was for school

- purposely kept my biological father &amp; I apart. she would tell him I wanted nothing to do with him and tell me he wanted nothing to do with me even though he tried to contact me a lot but she wouldn’t tell me. found this one out just a couple years ago actually

- threw all my bipolar meds out the window as “punishment” causing me to have nasty withdrawals for weeks

- held a knife to my throat when I was around the age of 12

- kicked me out at 17 for getting a bad grade in math and then threatening to report me as a runaway unless I do everything she says

- made the entire family turn against me any time she &amp; I had issues (she had them all manipulated and they always took her side)

- threatened to call immigration on my best friend &amp; her family (who were all legal except one family member) because she was jealous of my best friend

- wouldn’t take me to the doctor once I hit high school age because I was being “overdramatic” &amp; also would not take care of me when I was sick

- forced me to thank her on multiple occasions for not aborting me while she had the chance

- would destroy my personal belongings when she was upset to get back at me (also took my Christmas presents all back one year because I’m an “ungrateful child” and made me watch my sister open her gifts)

- forced me to hit my cat with force to “discipline” it for stupid things like throwing up on the carpet and getting up on the kitchen counter

- made me clean the entire house every day even if it got in the way of homework and had me waiting on her hand &amp; foot (she would even make me come all the way downstairs to hand her a remote on the table next to her)

- became stalkeresque through the years of no contact. would show up to my place unannounced, would somehow find out my number after I changed it many times or would text me from another number if I blocked her, as well as harassed my friends on social media trying to get my new info. then when I moved 12 hours away to a new state she drove all the way there and showed up at my doorstep again &amp; that’s when I could no longer give out my address or number to any family members or people I suspected were a “spy” as she had many people that would dig info out of me 

She never apologized or owned up to any of this. I didn’t receive any support from other family members. They all dropped me and believed her when she said I was just an ungrateful problem child and that’s why I cut her out. Any time I’d attempt to have a relationship with my sister, aunts, cousins, etc they would hassle me every single time on the fact that I need to apologize to my mother and speak to her again.

Needless to say I’ve spent all my adult years alone with the exception of a few good friends and the past 2 years I’ve been in a loving relationship.

Recently my mother has passed away and I feel guilty enough that I feel....nothing when it comes to this. It’s a mindfuck feeling slight relief and mostly apathy. I’ve cried thinking what is wrong with me?

But I’ll be truthful. I don’t love my mother I never did. I don’t miss her, I can’t miss what I never had, and aside from all she put me through she &amp; I never had much in common to begin with. To me, it is like she already died when I was 18 and cut off contact.

I didn’t show up to the funeral. I feel as though I don’t really have anything nice to say about her and a funeral is not the place to have that sort of attitude. I also don’t really want everyone to vilify me for not crying or showing enough sorrow over this. And funerals in general have always sort of freaked me out.

Ever since the funeral my phone has been blowing up from different family members. Saying how could I do this to my poor mother’s memory and how could I not be there for my sister during this time. 

I understand they’re hurt but at the same time I feel I do not owe it to anyone to be there. Throughout the years no one has been supportive to me including my sister. She has a husband, kids, many friends, and the rest of the family to support her. I don’t see how my presence at this funeral would’ve been comforting to anyone. I’ve been nothing more than a stranger to my family my entire adult life.

I am just wondering if I was in the wrong for this and if I was, what can I do to fix it? I’m feeling confused and lost at this point in my life and just really need some outside perspective.

**TL;DR: Mother was physically &amp; verbally abusive, made my childhood a living hell, been NC with her for 12 years and the family sided with her. I did not show up to the funeral as I felt that was best for me and now they’re extremely upset.**"
30,"My (18f) Dad (42m) and my best friend (18f) hooked up


I still don’t really know how to process this, it feels like I don’t even know anyone anymore.

We’ve been best friends since we were kids, she’s like a sister to me. We practically lived together during the summers. I trusted her with anything, I told her everything. She’d sometimes joke about my hot dad, but I didn’t take it too seriously, it’s kind of a running joke among my friends, especially since my parents divorced. 

My friend recently confessed to me that she has actually had a thing for my dad for a couple years now, and that she confessed her feelings to him last summer. (Even just that is bad enough, there’s gotta be some kind of rule that you don’t try to get with your best friend’s dad!!) The worst part is that he fucking reciprocated. She told me they had been sexual with each other, but also reassured me that they waited until she was 18 until pursuing anything. As if that’s going to make me feel better. My friend is like a sister to me, this feels borderline incestuous. 

I feel so betrayed, I feel like I don’t even know the two people closest to me. My friend and dad have been my rocks, they’re my foundation, and they destroyed that just so they could get it on. I’m not sure what’s worse, the idea of my friend coming over to my house when I’m not around, or doing it when we’re having sleepovers or she’s at my house and I’m home. 

I haven’t talked to my dad yet, I don’t even know what I would say, I can’t look at him the same. How could my dad sexualize a girl the same age as his daughter! A girl he watched grow up! I feel disgusted with both of them, but I feel especially betrayed by my dad. I don’t know how frequent this relationship (if you can call it that) of theirs is or whether it’s still going. Part of me doesn’t even want to find out, but it’s just been stewing in my mind and I had to get it out. 
How do I deal with this? Do I talk to my dad? Do I end what was supposed to be a life long friendship? 

tl;dr
My best friend since childhood confessed to me that her and my dad have been sleeping together behind my back. I feel betrayed by those closest to me, and that they put their own selfish wants over me."
31,"Aunt [50sF] introduced my [21f] sister [14f] as ""adopted"" (which she is) to other family members/people and it hurt her a lot. How can I support her?


We stayed last weekend at my aunt's home (mom's side) about 100km from home. Mom didn't go because she doesn't get along that well with several family members. It was our grandma's birthday.

She met several family members she had never met and got along well with cousins around her age. She met grandma and they got along super.

Our illustrious aunt, though, was organizing the whole thing and making sure people were comfortable, etc. She called my sister around several mostly distant older relatives we never see and introduced her as ""[mom and dad]'s adopted daughter"". Then asked her something like ""you were adopted at 8,9? Not that long ago, right?"". She kept mostly a poker face but was uncomfortable.

It was a short interaction and I was doing something else but caught the whole thing and was pretty furious. Later asked our aunt why she introduced her as adopted and she pretty casually told me *she actually was adopted* so that's why. It seemed pointless to argue so I didn't.

Other semi distant family members asked me about mom not having other children, adopting and I just told them whatever shut them up faster.

Later that night my sister said that made her feel bad but she was probably being silly. I told her she wasn't, aunt was totally out of line and she shouldn't have whipped that info out so casually, in fact she shouldn't have mentioned it at all.

Yesterday she asked me if she was a ""weird relative""? I told her she was just going to hurt herself thinking like that and we all loved her equally. She said she didn't feel other family members cared for her that much. I didn't know what to say and said that she could talk to me if she felt she needed to say something.

I have been thinking about it a lot. That I can't really relate to her pain, that I don't understand how she feels. It hurts to see her hurting and I wish to help her maybe direct the feelings in a more positive way, not so much dwelling in them painfully.

Or maybe there's another better approach. I don't know. Is there anything I can do her come to terms with the feelings? Or just anything, to help her feel a little better?

**tl;dr:** Aunt very insensitively introduced my sister to other family members as my parent's ""adopted"" daughter and she's been feeling bad for a few days. How can I help her feel better about this, and maybe with the subject in general moving forward?"
32,"My girlfriend [25F] accused me of ""peacocking"" because I [26M] accidentally left the receipt in her present. I'm having a hard time getting over it.


We recently had our 1-year anniversary and planned on doing a small gift exchange. I bought her a bracelet in a style she likes. For the record it wasn't super expensive. Definitely not cheap, but not like I went out and bought her something from Tiffany's. After I bought it I tucked the receipt in the flap of the box because I had been trying to decide between two different bracelets and thought I might return it. I decided not to, wrapped the present, and gave it to her during dinner on our anniversary. 

When she opened the box the receipt fell out because I had forgotten I tucked it in there. She rolled her eyes and said ""peacocking"" is so childish. I had never even heard that term before. She explained it (if anyone else is also not aware; basically showing off) and said I had clearly left the receipt there on purpose so she could see how much I spent and be impressed. I said no I didn't, I genuinely forgot the receipt was there. She didn't believe me and said who puts receipts in boxes like that instead of in their wallet. Well, I do. I always have. I like to keep the receipt *with* items I think I might return. I genuinely don't think that's out of the norm at all. I told her that wasn't the case and she just brushed it off and gave me my gift. 

This whole conversation really soured the mood of the evening. She never even thanked me for the gift, for one. Then she kept poking fun at me. When the waiter brought the check she made a comment about making sure I use my ""fancy card"" so he knows how rich I am. Then after dinner I was driving her home and she joked about realizing why I always insist on driving, because I have the fancy car. A: Not true, I do drive the majority of the time but mostly because I just like driving and because she never offers. and B: I don't have a ""fancy"" car. My car is maybe half a step nicer than hers. 

After all of this I told her to stop and it was really starting to piss me off. We got into a bit of a fight about it. She gave a half-assed ""sorry but I was just kidding"" apology. Since then I've been trying to get over it and I'm having a hard time. Bottom line is I'm pretty irritated and she seems to think I should just get over it. 

In case it's relevant: I'm not richer than her or anything. We both have decent jobs and grew up in middle class families. I'm not ""rich"" by any means and our wealth disparity is basically non-existent. So I don't think this is coming from a place of insecurity. I don't know what it is.

Am I overreacting? Do I just need to move on? Or am I right to be irritated by all of this? 

**TL;DR**: My girlfriend made a big deal out of me ""peacocking"" because I mistakenly left the receipt in her anniversary gift. She never really apologized and I can't get over it. What do I do? "
33,"My (20sf) and my friend (20sm) legitimately thinks he's dating Ariana Grande, and I have no clue what to do.


Let me preface this by saying that everything I'm going to say sounds like one big joke and he's fucking with me, so just trust me when I say these ridiculous things -  that I know he's being serious and delusional.

So, this guy I know, who I thought just really liked Ariana Grande is giving me signs he's delusional and obsessed. What started off as ""I love her music!"" and  ""She's so pretty!"" has quickly turned into ""See this tweet? This is about me."" and at first I thought he was joking, but things just  didn't seem right so when he brought up one of these ""tweets about him"" I decided to say ""haha yeah..but you know it's not."" when he went and had a FULL BLOWN MELTDOWN saying I was just jealous and I don't know what I'm talking about etc. And now I'm thinking he's serious when he says he's really gonna marry her.

Like, this guys definitely got a few screws loose you guys I'm telling you. Other than this one weird obsession though he's a completely normal dude.

TLDR: Dude seems unhealthily obsessed with Ariana Grande. Is it worth saying anything to him, since I guess it's not hurting anyone other than him being a weirdo and I suppose lying about things she does being about him, or no?"
34,"My [M23] boyfriend [M22] continuously picks fights about me making loud noises. I am not making these noises.


Hi, I don't use Reddit, so forgive me if the formatting is weird.

I've been with my boyfriend for almost seven years. I'll preface with the fact that he's a (lovably) negative person. Very pessimistic, very nihilistic. Also very vain. I don't particularly mind, we've meshed well and I can behave similarly sometimes.

What's been happening somewhat recently has me worried though. For the last few months, his behavior has gone beyond what would be ""normal"" for him. He's become oddly aggressive and hysterical over things that aren't happening, and I can't convince him that I'm not doing these things. 

The worst example I can think of is the door-slamming. I will admit that I am a bit of a loud person, but I'm never intentionally loud. I do not slam doors, but he's been very insistent that I'm slamming them wherever I go. I've become *very* gentle with how I close doors now, and even wear socks when I leave the house so my feet don't thump too loudly. Still, he'll scream at me for stomping around the kitchen or slamming the front door multiple times. I am not doing this. We live in a rural area and we have no neighbors close enough to be the cause of this noise. Other noises include:

-Baby crying. (We don't have kids, he claims I'm secretly babysitting one of our friend's kids.)
-TV static. (I rarely if ever operate the TV, I specifically stopped turning it on because he hated this static so much.)
-Blaring classical music. (We own no sound systems nor do either of us listen to classical music.)

I've asked him why he's accusing me of things that I am sincerely not doing, but he isn't having it. He claims I'm doing this to him intentionally, and he frames it as me ""accusing him of something"" if I try to explain how these noises can't possibly be happening. I can talk him down sometimes, but a lot of the time it feels like he's making something up so he can pick a fight. 

His negativity has gotten to be way too much for me as of late as well. He's now very graphic about his disliking of certain things, or his distrust of the government of politicians. Unnecessarily graphic, to the point where it's more disturbing than it is humorous. I and some of our friends expressed concern over this a couple times, and he became oddly hostile about this. I'm aware of at least one friend of ours that he no longer speaks to, and we don't know why.

I'm really at a loss. He doesn't bathe anymore, and he's the most (lovably) vain person I know. He never wants to leave the house now, not even to catch a show with his favorite band performing. Sometimes the fights get so bad that he pretends to call the cops while his phone is off just to scare me. It seems sometimes like he's trying to sabotage his life and push me and everyone else away. This is all just so bizarre and frustrating that it feels like I'm getting punked. 

I'm writing this all now because we just had another fight about the door slamming and I'm at a loss. I know I need to try talk to him about this again in a not-a-fight setting, but I'm at a loss as to what I should say. I want to be able to fix this, because he's still a great guy and I love him. I have suggested therapy, but he insists he's not depressed and that he doesn't like doctors. I understand there's something wrong behind the scenes, but he won't open up and I'm terrible with words. Can you guys help me?

TL;DR my boyfriend of seven years has taken a nosedive behaviorally, has been accusing me of making loud noises when I'm really not. Unsure how to coax him into actually talking about it or seeking help. "
35,"I (28f) find maintaining my relationships with family and friends so overwhelming


Ever since I moved out of my parents' house and left full time education, I have found it so hard to keep all my relationships going. Before I saw the people closest to me all the time out of circumstance, but now I never see them without someone making the effort.

The problem is I'm very introverted, and after spending 40 hours a week around my work colleagues and my evenings and weekends with my husband, I am so burnt out from socialising that I have nothing left for anyone else. 

I can easily go months without seeing my parents, siblings or closest friends. They all live within an hour's drive. Often there are are weeks separating any contact, even a text. 

I feel like I'm a terrible person, and I'm so guilty about it all the time. I'm always half expecting to be disowned by them for being so neglectful. Then the guilt and shame makes it harder to reach out. 

I know this is a common problem, but it's been almost a decade of trying to juggle this and get a good balance, and I'm still failing terribly.

I don't think it helps that my relationship with my family is not 100%, and I think that makes seeing them all the more difficult. But even my really great relationships feel like an enormous effort to keep going. 

Can anyone else relate, and do you have any advice to help me handle this better?

TL;DR Keeping in touch with my family and friends feels like an impossible task, how do I handle it better?"
36,"My (27f) sister (25f) is expecting me to take care of her like a parent and my attempts to set boundaries end up with me being labeled the B**** sister. How do I talk to her?


She graduated college in December and moved in with me a few days before Christmas. We’ve had a rocky relationship this past year because I have a serious bf (28m) who lives with me and she felt like everything was changing. She lived with us last summer and it really caused problems. (My bf and I both work full time and go to law school at night until 9:30pm so we don’t really have free time) She said cruel elitist things about his family, got mad at me because I don’t like the guy who she was sleeping with, and she never paid a dime to live with us. My boyfriend paid her portion of rent and I paid 2k for her summer school tuition. She caused problems with my parents (they’re divorced) by telling them I was bullying her and ignoring her. They both sided with her.

Flash forward to now. We live in my dads house (dad doesn’t live with us tho). It’s me &amp; my bf sharing a room, &amp; my sister, brother (21m) and my close friend (26f) in their own rooms. My sister is working part time minimum wage, making no efforts to get her EMT license (aka use her college degree), has boxes of her stuff all over our house and doesn’t pay bills on time, or clean regularly. Last week my dad had to pay her rent for Jan and Feb because she couldn’t afford it.

She doesn’t communicate with me. She never told me she was going to be late or asked if I could afford to cover her. I have to take out student loans to ensure I have enough to pay all the bills and  I don’t feel it’s fair that I have to cover for her.

I can feel that I’m starting to get bitter and resent her for every small annoying thing, when before all this drama I would have been able to let little stuff go.

She’s been away from home for a few years at college and I know she really just feels homesick and wants the 3 of us (my brother, her and myself) to hangout like in high school. But things are different. I have adult responsibilities and I’m in a committed relationship. She seems to be jealous that I’m happy and told my mom she felt lonely because I spend so much time with my bf. 

How do I talk to her? I’ve tried nicely asking for help (please pick this up, can you take your boxes to your room, don’t leave hair in shower drain etc.) and I’ve tried straight up telling her what she needs to do to contribute and do her part (I’ve left a list of chores and told her I wanted it done within the week, told her she needed to schedule her EMT test, etc). I even had a family meeting with my dad, step mom and siblings where I expressed how overwhelmed I was being the provider for all bills, food, toilet paper etc and NOTHING HAS CHANGED. Small improvements but nothing really helpful. What can I do now?

TL;DR my sister, a recent college grad, is not contributing to the household by paying bills, buying groceries or cleaning regularly. My attempts to talk seem productive but she doesn’t change her behavior. How do do I talk to her? She seems to think I’m being too hard on her, but I think she just needs to grow up. "
37,"Should I (26M) expect my partner (22M) to contribute to household expenses when he moves in to the house that I own?


My partner and I have been together now for almost 3 years (In April). In this time, I have been working full time earning ~£23k and he has been a full time student, so has had a much lower income. Because of this, I have definitely paid for more things when it comes to food, going out, gifts, petrol etc. and I haven’t minded paying because I know I’m in a better position to do so. 

We currently live separately, he is in shared rented accommodation and I own a house with a mortgage. This summer he finishes uni and will start earning significantly more than he was - around £18.5k initially which will increase a lot in a year. He is going to move in this summer when he starts working. 

I was thinking of asking my partner to contribute a small amount when he moves in, I am talking like £200-250 a month all in to help towards utilities (which will be more with an extra person in the house), council tax, home insurance (which would cover his extensive guitar and games console collection) etc. If he rented somewhere similar around where we live, the cost would probably be £600-800 a month all in plus a damage deposit and agency fees. So I think that asking for £250 is reasonable and he will still have more disposable income than me after spending that. 

When I mentioned the idea of a small contribution recently (I didn’t specify an amount) he essentially said he didn’t think it was fair because a) its my house, and he doesn’t think it’s fair to ‘pay for my mortgage’ and b) I have a paying lodger already so don’t need the money. We didn’t discuss it further as it was just mentioned in passing, but I still think what I’m asking is fair. We will both be saving to buy a larger house together in a couple of years, but in the meantime if he is earning a decent wage I don’t think it’s fair for me to pay all of the bills etc and him to live there totally free when he would pay way more anywhere else. I don’t see the amount I’m asking for as a contribution to the mortgage , I see it as a contribution to the bills, upkeep of the house etc. 
We will split other expenses like food, going out, travel and he will be getting his own car.

At the moment, all house related expenses (mortgage, tax, utilities, insurance etc) are usually £1000-£1200. £430 of that is the mortgage. I do have a lodger, who rents my spare room for £500 a month all in, which is on the cheap side for a large, en-suite room in this area. 
I get about £1400 wages after tax and have other expenses that I pay monthly too (I am paying back a loan from a family member at £250 a month, and have mobile phone, car expenses, cat food/vets, prescription charges etc so in reality I don’t have a ton of disposable income at the end. Most months now I break even and have been struggling to save much. So having that couple of extra hundred a month would allow me to actually build up some savings. 

I am just wondering what others have done in this kind of situation and if I am being unfair with what I’m asking. I want to approach the issue again but not sure how to do it and not sound like an evil money grabber lol! 



Tl;dr: I want my partner to pay some ‘rent’ when he moves into my house (I own it with a mortgage), he doesn’t want to. What would you do? "
38,"My (22f) boyfriend (25m) forced me to move


I'll try to make this brief and concise. My bf and I have been dating for 2.5 years. We met in college, he graduated before me so we've been long distance after he got a job in the military. I just graduated in December, so I still have a lease that ends in July. He needed to move for his job, but it's a guaranteed place for the next few years so we signed a lease together. I picked up a second job in order to start saving more money in order to move and help pay rent for two places.

&amp;#x200B;

He was going to move his stuff down and then take off for a month for training, and then be back permanently. So, I figured I would move down when he got back so I had time to find a sublet and work at the jobs I have. About a week and a half ago, he sent me this long text message that I should just move down with him when he does because it would be better for both of us in the long run. I didn't see things that way, so I said I didn't want to. He got pretty aggressive about it and that I should just do it because it isn't about me anymore, but about us.

&amp;#x200B;

I really did not want to move. I just wanted to pack on my terms so I knew where my stuff was, prioritize what goes where, and sort through some things. He shows up during his leave (as planned) and just started packing my things. I said I did not want to go yet, and he just kept saying we need to make this move now for us. I did not quit my jobs, I did not tell my landlord, I didn't even get to say goodbye to my coworkers.

&amp;#x200B;

He wanted to move this morning, and I had just gotten home from an overnight shift and had been awake for 18 hours at that point. He had all of my things packed into his truck and wanted to leave as soon as I got home. I said no, and he said I was just hindering things and making this move more difficult than it needed to be. Our pets were already packed in, and he told me that because I was taking so long they were going to freeze to death. I felt so scared and manipulated. I had never sobbed so hard in my life, and he was just there yelling at me to get going so we could meet the movers there. Didn't even care how upset I was over this. I was so shocked as to how he was treating me. He's never acted like this before.

&amp;#x200B;

We're here now and I'm so depressed. I don't know why I got in that car, but I didn't feel like I had a choice. He had all my belongings. My parents are absolutely livid about it. He's been acting like everything is just going to be fine now, but I don't feel like I can ever move on and forgive him.

&amp;#x200B;

How do I handle this now? I feel like I need to break it off. If we continue after today, I've essentially told him that getting really angry at me will make me do what he wants. That he can just make big life decisions for me because it's what he thinks is right for the two of us. I just don't know how I'm going to get all of my things home, how to get out of this lease, and just generally end a long term relationship. My parents wanted to get the police involved, but I don't know if that's necessary. I just need some kind of direction to get away from this.

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR Long distance boyfriend and I sign a lease together while I still have another one, and I wanted to move my things on my own terms. He comes to visit me, packs all of my belongings, puts them in his truck, and tells me I have to move right now without me quitting my jobs or contacting my landlord. What do I do?"
39,"Am I right to be mad at my boyfriend keeping sexual photos of others?


So my boyfriend and I got into a fight because I found out he still had sexual pictures and nudes from girls he used to date/sleep with

He told me I’m being crazy and that all the girls he knows wouldn’t care if their boyfriend kept nudes of his ex’s and girls they’d slept with

He also spent Valentine’s Day out with friends instead of with me, 2 of the girls there he had slept with and has pictures of them on his phone. It just makes me feel so unimportant and idk, am I wrong for being mad?

40,"My(24f) fiancé(26m) is in love with someone else. His dog.


Hello! This is my first post on reddit but I really need an unbiased opinion please! :-)
I have been with my fiancée for three years now and we’re extremely close. When we started dating, he had a dog that was about a year old or so, Duke. Duke is about four years old now but is completely untrained. He has “accidents” in the house at least two to three times a day, to the point where my fiancé insists we can’t move into a house with carpet because it would “make it harder to clean up after him”. Duke has chewed up and broken my iphone, a handbag, shoes, multiple articles of clothing, has nearly torn out a piercing, and has cut my face multiple times as well. My fiancé thinks this is endearing because he’s “playful”.
I LOVE dogs and have always had at least one, and I understand that they’re rough especially when they’re young, but it’s gotten to the point where I cannot stand Duke or my fiancé’s excuses for him. At this point, he won’t let me scold his dog or even playfully call Duke names (like ugly or stinky) without taking personal offense and harshly reprimanding me for “hurting his feelings.”
Recently, I got a new job and can only see him for a couple of hours per day, which would be fine if he didn’t spend a quarter of that time talking to or about Duke or even scrolling through his phone looking at pictures of him. I love him and his dog, but sometimes I want to do things or even have conversations without planning everything around the dog. Even when we go out, he spends time looking at photos and asking me how lonely I think Duke is without him at home. When I bring this up to him, he tells me that Duke saved his life when he went through a depressive episode years ago, which again would be fine if he hadn’t already insisted I cut contact with two of my very best friends (for about ten years each) because they were rude to him (which they were, so I did.) 
He has been growing increasingly cold to me lately and just last night told me very seriously that he was concerned that I’m not “dog-mom material.” 
I feel like I’m going crazy. I don’t want to lose the love of my life to a dog. What can I do?

TL;DR: my fiancé lets his dog run his life and seems to resent me for not wanting to do the same. Help!"
41,"My boyfriend just admitted that he’d been lying to me for months


My(21f) boyfriend (23m) just told me that he’d been lying to me about something for months. 

I’m a senior in college right now and my boyfriend is a year ahead of me in school. We’ve been together for almost 2 years. Last May he graduated, or so I thought. He has had a job this whole time, but yesterday he told me that he never actually finished his degree. He told me he’s currently taking classes and is going to actually finish in May at the same time as me. He said that he lied because he felt really ashamed about not being able to finish on time and didn’t want me to look down upon him. He also said that he hadn’t told anyone, but me. I currently feel super shocked and told him that we shouldn’t talk for a couple days. I really thought I could marry this guy, but now everything feels confusing. This is his first fuck up in nearly two years, so do I let him off the hook? Or is it time for me to move on? 

TL;DR: my boyfriend lied to me about finishing his degree and now I don’t know what to do. "
42,"My (37F) husband (38M) won’t stop spying on me on the nanny cams with other people.


My husband is into a lot of home automation stuff.  
We have nest cams in our family room/kitchen area and in our basement.  He likes to show people (like literally everyone — family members, random people at work, etc.) his set up. He pulls up the cameras to show them when I am at home.  I only found out he did this because he accidentally hit the talk button once and I could hear him talking about me with some woman at work — nothing bad, but it really bothered me.  I have repeatedly asked him not to do this or to give me a heads up before he does, and he apologizes and agrees, but he keeps doing it anyway.

I feel incredibly violated and embarrassed by this.  It makes me feel like I can’t be comfortable in my own home because I don’t know when he is literally letting someone watch me.

Am I overreacting?  What should I do?

TL;DR: Husband keeps showing people our home cams with me on it."
43,"My [18f] Boyfriend [18m] had sex with me while I was asleep.


so on valentines day, I asked my boyfriend to get some condoms because I wanted to have sex but by the time he got home I was so tired, I told him I would wake him up with sex when I got up and he said okay. now this doesn't go both ways. I had asked him to wake me up with sex a while ago but I didn't enjoy it, so I told him not to do that again. I didn't blame him for that, I asked for it but I think I made my wishes vey clear in that department.

Cue back to me being asleep, I woke up to his finger inside me and I was just wtf? he didn't notice I had woken up but there have been a few times where might have felt penetration in my sleep but I honestly don't even know as I'm a really heavy sleeper. I really wanted to know how far he would take it. he alternated between penetration and fingering me I was turned on but I also just wanted to throw up. I didn't even know how to tell him to stop, I was mortified. How he did it seemed like he's done it before like he knew exactly what to do. he didn't use a condom, for the year we've been dating I always make him use a condom. He didn't cum inside me but I took a plan b just in case but I'm ovulating at the moment so I'm kind of freaked out.

after he finished I started crying, I told him he had five minutes to take his shit and leave, I asked him how many times he's done it, what the hell he was thinking. he said ""I'm sorry, this was the first time"" like why are you trying to console me about the amount of times it has happened when you should just feel guilty, I feel like he's hiding something. I know he answered a direct question I asked but I don't think somebody in that situation would address that question in particular unless they felt like they *had* to.

so I shoved him out of the apartment and slammed the door. my mom was sleeping on the couch and she got pissed that I woke her up. I couldn't say anything at the time,I decided to shower and calm down. I felt like I had to tell my mom otherwise she's gonna pressure me to get back with him again and I just don't want her to go off about what a good relationship we had and how we should fix things. I didn't want her sympathy but I wanted a bit of help ridding him from my life as he has practically moved in. When I told her, I contemplated going to the police and at least filing a report without pressing charges. she lost her mind, she told me what happened was totally normal and that I shouldn't ruin her life and his life over it. my mom blamed me because I don't have sex with him enough and that I fell asleep after I invited him over and because I let it happen. she was so angry and prior to me telling her I was okay but at this point I was in hysterics and called the police. she went berserk and was so worried about her image the whole time. once they got at my apartment I just lied through my teeth about my boyfriends info because they told me they had to pursue with or without my okay and they wanted to make my bedroom an active crime scene and take the clothes I was wearing into evidence.

I go to the same school and have the same social circle as him, I don't know what the fuck to do with myself, I lost him but I also lost all of my friends, I don't know if I should tell them what happened as I met them all through him. I even share the same social worker as him and I'm worried if I tell anyone they're not going to believe me or make it the talk of the school. and was I even assaulted, I think I'm kind of blowing this out of proportion because of the argument with my mom

&amp;#x200B;

tl;dr: my boyfriend had sex with me when I was asleep/half asleep without a condom when he knew I don't like that. my mom is blaming me.  we share the same social circle so I think I just lost all my friends.  "
44,"My (26F) mother (50F) completely betrayed my trust and told multiple family members that I was pregnant, at a time when I was not sure if I wanted to keep the baby or not.


I got pregnant by my boyfriend, not even sure how it happened. When I found out, I was split between getting an abortion or keeping it or giving it away. Me and my boyfriend have been dating for 3 years and are thinking about marriage, but still, it seemed too early. 

I told my mom, and specifically told her not to tell anyone, at all, because I was not sure if I was keeping it. Her friends/family are religious and if they found out I was pregnant and got all excited, then found out I had an abortion? Its just too much to handle. She agreed to not tell anyone. 

Except for the fact that she did tell people, a lot of people. I went over my aunts house for a dinner party and right away she started talking about the fact that I was pregnant. My mom wasn't there (my mom lives very, very far), and I just acted like this was normal. Basically my entire family knows now. 

We eventually decided to keep the baby, and I am 7 months pregnant now. But I never talked to my mom about this issue. I never brought it up how much her revealing my secret hurt me like crazy. I feel almost like weak to her in some ways, like I would feel bad criticizing her, because she is such a sensitive and sweet person overall, but this was *such* a fucking betrayal of trust. I actually cried after that dinner party because I was so hurt. How did she not realize the consequences of her actions, even when I told her I probably wasn't going to keep the baby? Does she not understand that I told her how important it was to not tell anyone, and that if I did get an abortion, a huge amount of my family would likely hate me and think of me as a baby killer? 

I am not sure how to bring this up to her, how much this hurt me. She is sensitive, as I said, and we don't ever really argue or even have debates or anything. But over the past few months I cannot NOT think about this every time I talk to her. 

What do I say? 

TL;DR - - Told my mom I was pregnant, and wasn't sure if I wanted to keep it or not. Told her to keep it a secret, and she didn't, she told everyone. "
45,"My [23 M] GF [22 F] is suddenly not ok with my profession


Starting with the most important question, im a professional gambler (poker/sportsbetting etc) and have been since i started out playing daily fantasy sports at 18. Over the last 5 years i have made (profit) about 70k a year on average. I know there is a stigma on gambling but i treat it like my job which it is, and am good about saving money and planning future moves.

My Girlfriend and I have been dating for 9 months, and she knew right off the bat that i was a pro gambler, and that i had no intention of changing career paths anytime soon. At first she was really cool with it, and talked about how she enjoyed things like me being around a lot, not having to ""go to work"" in a more traditional sense. In the last few weeks though her (and some of her family/friends) have taken a sharp turn.

She is now mentioning how as we start to get serious, i should start to get serious with my life choices and ""work on becoming more stable"". I was at her parents house last week and the general theme i got from them was that sooner or later you have to mature and let you life mature with it but it was said in such a matter of fact (almost nice) way. Almost like it was such an obvious thing to do that it was just common knowledge. Two of her friends have also made offhand comments in the last 2 weeks that are basically the same as her parents.

I guess i understand where the cold feet can come from on being with someone who does what i do, but i feel like i was honest upfront so i shouldn't feel much sympathy even though i can empathize. I talked to her about the comments her and others have been making and she seemed to just play it off as a progression of life and the relationship. I feel incredibly lucky to do what i do, as its been a dream since i watched the world series of poker on ESPN growing up  and realized it was my best shot to make it on ESPN lol. 

I guess my question basically is should i give her time to work these feelings out after i make it clear again this is what i do for a living, or just end it as we obviously have different views.

TL;DR GF was fine with me begin a professional gambler at onset of relationship, is no longer fine with it 9 months in

46,"My [28f] husband [29m] threw a temper tantrum because I asked him to put away the leftovers.


Sorry for formatting on mobile 

So my husband has a meltdown because I asked him to put the food up last night before bed. It was almost 2am and I was tired. He always gets home very late and gets upset with me if I’m asleep when he gets home. 

Me: can you put the food away?

him: really? 

Me: can you please put it away? 

Him: so the guy who has to work 10 hours tomorrow has to put the food away are you kidding me?

Me: I said nothing 

Him: really??!!

M: can you please, just put it in a plastic bag or tinfoil.

I had already let the dogs out and went to brush my teeth. Got the dogs back inside gave them their cookies and put my dirty Landry in the basket. Then I remembered he had a ripped shirt in the laundry so before I would forget about it I walked out and asked

Me: are you going to do something with this shirt?

He didn’t answer me he just said: what the fuck!! Where are the bags?! Stop leaving empty boxes everywhere!!! Fuck!! 

Then I asked again what he was going to do with the ripped shirt and asked if I could give it to the dog. Then he shouts 

Him: what are you asking me?!

Then I repeated myself and he just lost it when he found the big bags and started slamming the pantry door over and over and over again. Stuff was flying out of the doors and I was going to tell him to stop but I figured that would just make him more mad. 

Then I walked away and we didn’t talk about it. We never talk about his tantrums because that makes him mad when I call him out on his stuff. 

TL;DR husband threw a temper tantrum when I asked him to put the leftovers away. I want confront him about it but I know this will make him mad."
47,"My (30f) sister (33f) periodically fires verbal abuse at me and blaming her psychiatric disorder (BPD). I can't bring myself to forgive and forget.


I'll try and keep this as short as possible. I could write a novel, I really could. My sister has had mental health problems since she was around 13. As a teenager, she was in and out of psych wards and ended up living in an institution. She would self harm, hear voices, take overdoses, etc. She's been a lot better for years now but will never be problem-free. She's always maintained that she has depression and anxiety, but she's relatively recently come up with the diagnosis of borderline personality disorder. I don't know for certain but I don't think she's been given this diagnosis by a professional. I'm not saying she doesn't suffer from this.

She lacks a lot of social skills. She has issues buying presents for people and so sometimes doesn't. I was hurt at the time that she never gave me a wedding present, but I'm over that now and it's pretty superficial of me to care about that. What I do have an issue with is she says I sometimes ""trigger"" her and she goes off on a tirade, insulting me, verbally hurting me. She then, pretty soon afterwards, apologises and says she didn't mean any of it. The way she says the nasty things, I know that she DOES mean them and what she's really sorry about is that she's told me.

This has happened a number of times and I've always accepted her apology, albeit reluctantly, and moved on. I'm fed up now. She says it's her BPD and she can't help it. I know that those who have mental health problems need to have allowances made for them.... But my question is how far does that go? Does she really get a free pass to make me feel like s**t because of her BPD? It's easy to say ""don't take it to heart"", etc, but that's so hard! Especially when I know she does in fact mean the things she says.

I'm not blameless in this. I have my own mental health problems (depression and anxiety), but I'm always civil to her. I sometimes put my foot in it but I'm only human. The issue is that we're both really sensitive, especially to each other, as there's a history or resentment and competitiveness.

If she was a friend then I would have stopped being her friend years ago. But she's family and I don't think I have it in me to have done with her, though I wish I could do that.

I suppose it's difficult to make a judgement when you don't know the entire back story and when you've only got my side of things. But any advice would be welcome, especially from those who have BPD or know someone who does. TIA.

TLDR - Sister supposedly has borderline personality disorder. She hurls verbal abuse at me periodically. I don't know whether BPD gives her a free pass to do that. She's really hurt me and I don't know how to get past it. "
48,"My friend (25M) is trying to start a career in standup, but now he only talks to me (23F) like he’s actually doing standup


I love my friend very much, and we’ve been friends a long time. But it’s been a little hard communicating with him recently, not only over text, but on the phone and in real life. He’s a very funny guy, and he’s starting to develop a standup routine. I’m all for supporting my friends, but it’s starting to feel like his whole identity is wrapped up in comedy and standup now. 

Whenever we text, it turns into him doing a long, “funny” monologue about something, maybe not even pertaining to what we were talking about. His objective seems to be to make a funny point and get me to laugh, but it just ends up turning into both mansplaining a topic I already know about while also trying to funny. 

Our phone conversations have become almost untenable, because it just kinda turns into him talking at me about various while waiting for me to laugh at what he says. It just doesn’t feel like a conversation, it’s me being an audience to his own internal monologue.

We hung out last night in person and it was much of the same thing. I love my friend, but it’s hard to keep up a relationship with a person when it feels like I’m just listening to him read from a script. Should I address this at all? Or do I just let the obsession die down? 

tl;dr my friend had decided he wants to be a standup comedian, and it’s changed his whole personality and how we interact."
49,"Sister &amp; BIL (childfree) [30s/M&amp;F] are upset I [27/F] don't ask them to babysit. Causing drama.


My husband and I have twin boys. I never planned on it, but here we are. They're 3 and just an absolutely handful. I am pregnant again with a girl and we're nursing my husband's vasectomy wounds this weekend. A big problem is my sister and her husband have become more and more upset that we don't ask them to babysit anymore. 

My sister and her husband are childfree and have decided they want to be ""cool aunt and uncle"" instead of mom and dad. The problem is, their lack of experience with kids and the way they've set-up their lives mean they just aren't able to handle two boys. They have too many knick-knacks and trinkets out and about; they have expensive items on display and their house is like a magazine photo of a DINK Hipster fantasy. Every time they watched the kids, they were so flustered and wrecked that you could tell they were beyond frustrated. My husband and I agreed it wasn't right. The kids were stressed and it wasn't fair on anyone. 

This weekend we asked my BIL [27/M] to watch them while my husband got his procedure done. The boys went to their uncle's place for the day and had their usual chaotic fun. They used licorice to tie pizza around their neck so they could snack and walk; they had a snow fight, set-up potties in the living room so the boys could pee and watch TV and ran around so much that by the time I got them in the car at 5:00 they both passed out and slept the whole night. My BIL sent photos of two pantless three year olds with pizza necklaces watching Blippi. They LOVE going to their uncle's place. 

My BIL is better with kids. He isn't overly precious about things and puts expensive items away; he's a much, much more easy going person, so the kids aren't stressed out. 

This has caused problems with my sister who sees herself as ""cool aunt"" and can't understand why we don't ask them to watch the kids more often. If I leave them with my sister, I have to check-in every 30 minutes, need to tell her how to handle the kids and then hear how some knick-knack almost broke. It's more work for me to leave them with her than taking them. I've had gentle conversations where I tell her what is required to watch kids, but SHE DOESN'T GET IT. I can't get her to understand what it takes to watch kids. 

Husband's vasectomy was another instance. Once she found out BIL was watching the kids, she became annoyed and texted me about 30 times during my husband's procedure and then wanted to talk about things when we got home and he rested. The last thing I wanted to do was have the conversation with her so I put it off. Husband spiked a fever and we had to visit a clinic, so it was a good reason to not to talk to her (husband's fever was unrelated and went away quickly. If anyone is considering a vasectomy, don't worry about infection!). 

She still wants to talk but I'm at a loss. I've told her what involves watching kids but she refuses to accept what I say. I'm tired of the drama around this but can't seem to convey that her lifestyle doesn't work and she needs to stop seeing herself as ""cool aunt being denied kids"" and ""uptight aunt that shouldn't watch kids."" 

tl;dr my sister wants to babysit her nephews but she's too uptight and leads a life that is NOT conducive to watching kids, even for an hour. Every time I try and tell her, she doesn't get it and it's more stressful having her babysit than just taking the kids on my own.

50,"My partner (23M) does not eat vegetables.


That title was a bit weird to write out. But, yeah, there's no twist in the post...he literally doesn't eat vegetables. Or fruit. Or like remotely anything healthy. 

He eats a piece of meat and some type of carb for his meals. Like steak and rice, pork chop and noodles, etc. No sauce, very little seasonings. Moreover, when we get fast food: three hard shell tacos with only meat, or a burger with just meat. COME ON. 

At the beginning of our relationship, it didn't bother me (24F). I feel like that is pretty standard; the longer you date, the more you get attached, the more intense feelings you have for someone. So, I obviously care now. He is indirectly going to kill himself by 40 because of his horrible eating habits. 

I've brought this up more than a few times. This last time, in December, he said he would try one new thing each weekend. He doesn't like to try new things because it stresses him out. But he said one thing per weekend is doable. 

It's February, and that never happened. So now I'm back to feeling like a nagging mother to my boyfriend. I hate this feeling, but I hate this horrible diet even more. This last argument, I had to literally break it down to: ""I don't want to raise children with someone who eats like this, because not only will the kids think they can get away with eating the same diet, but you are literally going to die before they go to college."" I feel like that's a pretty shitty thing to tell someone, but we've had no progress in two years. 

tl;dr
My boyfriend of two years doesn't eat any healthy food and I'm worried he will make himself sick because of it. He doesn't care.

So, please, help me out. What would you do in my shoes? What should my next steps be? Am I overthinking this? Or am I justified in being upset/frustrated/worried?

"
51,"My [f 20] mother [46] keeps coming into my room when she thinks I’m not in the house.


This is my first reddit post and it’s on Mobil so I’m sorry if it’s wonky looking or there’s some grammar mistakes. 

To start me and my mom have never had a great relationship and I pretty much moved out the spring I turned 19, but I recently moved back in. At first everything was fine until I got my license and I started looking for a car. My mom was really supportive and helped me find a car, at first until she took all the control from me and picked the car she wanted for me because she liked the price and thinks she can just take it from me and give it to my sister when she turns 16.

This is where things start going down hill, I only paid 400 for the car, and since then I haven’t seen the car, and when I ask about I’m always given allusive answers about the car and the progress on it. It has been almost 4 months. Right after I gave the money to my mom whenever she thought I wasn’t home she would come into my room. Because ye job I work at requires me to work very early morning and very late nights. I don’t know why or what she’s looking for. Its not even at a certain time in the day. Sometimes she’ll wake me up at 6 am coming in. Or sometimes she’ll walk in mid afternoon or in the middle of the night. 

One time she woke me up at 4 am and the way my beds positioned she didn’t see me because I was laying down. I couldn’t see her but I heard her in my desk, because She moved my work keys which are pretty loud, and my drawer was being opened as it’s a little rusty and squeaks when it’s opened. After she realized I was in the room she apologized and left really quickly. I asked her about it after she got off work she got defensive and said she was just checking if I was home. Then she refused to talk about it anymore and said I was being paranoid. 

At this point I can’t cant approach her about it without being accused of being hysterical and paranoid. I’ll admit I do have a history of having mental health issues but my mom never takes them seriously until it benefits her like when we’re arguing. I don’t know if I should bother trying to approach her again. Or if I should start looking for alternative living situations. 

TL;DR: My Mom keeps sneaking into my room when she thinks I’m not home, and calls me crazy when I try to approach her about it.

52,"I am afraid of losing my best friend who I am avoiding because her husband may have done something bad


About 5 years ago, I officiated my best friend (of 25 years)'s wedding. All three of us are in our late 40's, I am a gay male and my best friend is female...her husband is male, obviously) .

I always thought my friend's husband is odd, his mother is odd, his children (from prior marriage) are odd, and he cheated on his exwife with my friend (until he got a divorce and married my friend).  He's nice enough, but needy and overly giving...I have no problem with this type of personality (never liked the cheating part though).  

Anyway, I got a call from my friend who was crying because this past November, at 5am, law enforcement served her and her husband a subpoena, put them in handcuffs, and took their computers which had about two dozen child porn images on them. 

The husband had to hire an attorney, lost his job (but found another) and is current waiting 9 months before law enforcement decides to press charges.  

I spend days worried sick of how my friend's life and finances could be over.  But my friend insists she believes her husband when he says it was not him, and wants me to just act normal.  

She made me not tell anyone, so I have had to keep my despair for my friend's situation to myself (not easy to do) and put off Christmas and other get togethers...this pissed her off. 

My friend told me I hurt her feelings by not accepting her husbands innocence and for avoiding her.  I am afraid I will never be able to accept her husband even if he gets out of any charges, and I cannot see her wanting to be my friend if I feel that way.

Question: How could I be handling this better without going crazy?

TL;DR    i am torn between wanting to be with my best friend, and unable to face her husband real or imagined repugnant actions, and this makes me afraid I will lose my best friend. "
53,"My [25F] now-ex-boyfriend [27M] wants to give me ""alimony"" since we are separating after 5 years. Is that weird?


I've been in school the entire time we've been together. He's bee out with a masters working for 2 years. His field pays way more than mine ever will.

We mutually decided to split up and I'm the one that's moving out. I have to quit my full-time job, lose my insurance, and move 1000 miles back to my parents' home. He will stay at the apartment and keep his job. 

He wants to give me some ""help"" before I go because I am the one being set back. He initially offered to help me find a new job/apartment, but I feel it's best we make a clean cut once I leave.

54,"I [35M] found nude pics on my wife’s [36 F] phone and think they’re for someone else


Hi all, we’ve been married for 10 years.  We have 2 beautiful children and have always had a solid, no drama relationship.  We don’t hid passwords, use each other’s phones etc.  

Friday night I opened her laptop and started looking at photos in the Mac photos app, which syncs her phone photos.  I clicked on the deleted photos tab on the left and found 4 photos she’d taken earlier in the week while at home with the kids right before I got home from work.

One selfie where she’s cupping her bare breasts for the camera, 3 others of on pose where she’s changed in to a work hoodie and is nude from the waist down, touching herself.  She took the 3 at an angle and adjusted her smile in each seemingly to look sexy. She took these on Tuesday after work in our bathroom from angles where you wouldn’t see any clutter.  

I should note , I haven’t received a nude photo from my wife maybe in our entire relationship.  Even after playfully asking she never seemed interested. We’ve done pic/video stuff early in our relationship.  Also, she deleted these photos, I haven’t received any of them so I don’t think they were intended for my eyes.

I snooped her phone after this discovery and don’t see suspicious messages, other than the text history deleted before the photo time stamps with one of her co workers with whole she has to communicate with a lot.  My minds been racing so I also checked Verizon text logs and didn’t see any texts go out right after the photos with pic/video.  Also didn’t see photo messages go out to that guy or anything that looks suspicious.  Should also note that text logs to me are inconsistent, showing photo messages to me on days I didn’t get any.

She could be sending on Snapchat or fb messenger.  

What do I do next?  I figure I could try to ignore it or look for other signs, I could ask her about them with the risk she denies sending anything and we build resentment, or I could hire a PI and try to catch her in the act or reveal that there’s nothing.  I’d really appreciate some advice so I can act accordingly and move on from sleepless nights.

tl;dr I found nudes oh my wife that weren’t meant for my eyes

55,"My mom (53F) just can't snooping on my (27M) room and invading my privacy. Should I confront her?


My sick  mother  moved into my apartment temporarily from her residence in another state 3 months ago in order to concentrate on taking some 6 therapy treatment as my place is nearer the hospital as opposed to where she stays. However during this period, the privacy I used to enjoy while staying alone is in jeopardy. Recently I had kept some personal items and effects which my girlfriend owns in my bedroom and whenever I step out, I always come back to find the items and bags all frisked, moved around and tampered with, much to my frustration. I would later overhear on phone telling her friends of the things she came across in my bedroom. 

I feel so annoyed and furious about this considering the respect I have for her as an only parent, but I feel as though this is way beyond the boundaries of respect. I don't go snooping around her stuff and I expect the same sort of treatment. I have been contemplating to move out to another apartment once she is done with her therapy sessions. Am I justified to confront and raise this with her? I need input and opinions on how t deal with this awkward situation. 

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR: My mom will not stop snooping on my room when I go to out or to work, and tells it around to her friends. Am I justified to confront her?"
56,"Recently learned my [22M] father [51M] was physically abusive towards my mom [40F] and its shaken me to the core.


Now some background context my parents are both poor immigrants who immigrated from Vietnam, very little education didn't make much of themselves (this is for context, I owe my success to them) 

For most of my upbringing we lived in multifamily homes, like I said not educated nor rich , my mom had a job at a factory, and my father was a stay at home dad.

They divorced when I was 4 or 5 over my mom's gambling addiction, but sometime prior to that my dad actually actually jumped out the second floor window and we tried to hold on to him, but &lt;5 year old me, &lt;4 year old sister, and mom weren't strong enough to hold on. This might seem weird to mention but the point of this is my father is mentally ill (along with manic depressive).

When they divorced my father pretty much told me if you want to see me again come with me otherwise you'll never see me again, I was a 5 year old kid, and growing up my father was around (because my mom was working/gambling at nights), so It made sense to me.

So for many reasons (but mainly the above (I blamed my mom for the divorce) I've never been close to my mom, I know she loves me dearly but I was a terrible son, when I would visit the city she lives in I would hang with my friends. I'd send Christmas gifts occasionally like small gift cards and such but yeah me and her weren't close. 

Anyways yeah my past is pretty fucked up and I plan on seeing a therapist over that stuff, what I didn't know was that my father would physically abuse her, he'd actually hit my mom and leave bruises.

I learned this from my aunt( family friend) when I visited home over the weekend, we were talking and we got to the topic of my mom, whose very close with my aunt. Now recently my mom's brother and father passed away so she had to send money home, this left her without money for rent. My aunt told me how my mom would cry because she couldn't pay rent and couldn't ask me (cause she knew I wouldn't send her money) or my sister (she's a student).

Now to interject the reasons I wouldn't send her money is because I knew she had a gambling problem and I didn't know if I could trust her, what I didn't know was she hasn't gambled in years. I was basically fed lies by my father about my mom that I just believed and based my relationship on, he would lie about her gambling and her multiple boyfriend's, and now I realize he's just vindictive, he's actually remarried and he continues to tell lies about my mom to his parents, who then spread gossip where her parents back home will hear it. 

Now continuing with my aunt, she told me about how when my mom would call because I sent her a Christmas gift and what she said basically translates, ""big sis! big sis! Look what my son got me"", at this point I bawled my fucking eyes out because I didn't realize how bad I had treated her where sending her a small insignificant gift was something she valued. I hurt my mom and I want to make reparations, and shortly after talking to my aunt I visited my mom and told her I knew about everything, I brought my sister too and we all hugged and cried. 

I realize how terrible if a son I've been and I want to make up for all the missed mother's days and her birthdays (which I don't even fucking have memorized), I make a decent living and I want to get her a gift but I don't know what to get her. I want to rebuild my relationship with her and mend the pain I caused her. 

My mom doesn't hate me cause she knew I didn't know, and shell always love both of us, but I know how much ive hurt her and I just want to make things right.

The reason why Ive been deeply affected by it is because it's made me look at my past and realize one of core character traits (the nice guy (not r/niceguys tho) ), just isn't true. I can't be a ""nice guy"", nice guys don't hurt their moms like I did. Ive had a more fucked up past than I realize so yeah therapy for that and depression. 


tl;dr had a difficult childhood, blamed my mom for a lot of it, probably hurt her emotionally but she loves me regardless, found out my dad hurt her physically and I want to make amends. "
57,"My wife thinks I'm obsessed with her friend


My (42M) lovely wife (35F) is naturally insecure, and my previous marriage ended with infidelity on part, so she is a bit paranoid/jealous as expected.  She is especially suspicious that I have a crush on her friend Amy, who is married.  Amy is a very nice woman, and attractive, but not my type at all.  Plus I love my wife, and I have deep regret/guilt for being unfaithful in my previous marriage and would never betray her like that.


We have hung out with Amy and her husband Chris 6-7 times.  The first time time I met them was at a group dinner.  I was meeting 3 couples for the first time, all my wife's friends.  I was sat next to the husbands (on my right) and Amy (on my left).  For 30 minutes I made small talk with the guys but they are into things I don't care about and the conversation was awkward.  At some point Amy turned to me and started innocent chit chat.  This eventually led to her bragging about how amazing her husband is.  We talked for maybe 10 minutes, but my wife got pissed.  Her impression was that we ""hit it off"" and I was being flirtatious.  I told her that was ridiculous, I was only being friendly, and Amy was talking about her husband nonstop.  We ended up having a major fight.

Fast forward months later and Amy hosts my wife's bachelorette party at her house.  She (along with some help from other friends) decorated the house, blew up a bunch of balloons, bought food/drinks, etc.  My wife was very touched by this and told me repeatedly how much it meant to her.  I didn't have Amy's number but we were FB friends so I messaged her there.  Here was the exchange:

Me: Just wanted to say thank you so much for all you did for Ashley. She was beyond elated. She couldn’t stop talking about how awesome her night was and everything you did.

Amy: Oh absolutely! It was so much fun to be able to surprise her. We love her so much! Looking forward to your big day and so much fun and love in the future!

That was from 9/10/18.  No further FB communication since then.  We hung out with them again at Thanksgiving and Amy and I ended up chatting at one point for 15 minutes (everyone else was in the same room).  Ashley didn't like this and we got into another fight.  Finally I told her she had nothing to worry about, but that I would ""dial back"" the interaction with Amy if it made her feel better.

A week later Amy and Chris throw a birthday party for their son and invite us and my son.  We go.  It's an indoor trampoline place.  After 10 minutes I see Amy so I walk up to say ""Thanks for inviting us"" and other innocent small talk.  This lasts maybe 5 minutes.  My wife is 10 feet away chatting with another friend but I know she is probably not happy so I cut the conversation short.  I sit down next to my wife who is clearly pissed and she says ""You just can't resist her can you?""  At this point I snap.  I lose my shit and say ""Are you fucking serious? What the hell is wrong with you?!"" etc.  No kids were in earshot, but I'm sure other parents heard me.  Another huge fight ensues.  No matter what I say I can't convince her I don't have feelings for Amy.

Time passes.  No more issues with Amy, until today.  Wife is on my phone and goes into my FB Messenger app to snoop.  Scrolls down and sees the above chat with Amy, and flips out.  ""I knew it! This is confirmation of what I suspected all along!"" etc.  She asks why I only said thank you to Amy and not the other girls.  I told her Amy was the host and I was under the impression that Amy did most of the work.  Then she asks why I didn't tell her that I messaged Amy.  I said it just didn't occur to me and I probably forgot five minutes later.

So my question is, was I wrong to send that to Amy?  Is Ashley right to think I have a crush on Amy?

TL;DR my wife mistakenly believes I have a crush on her married friend Amy.  Five months ago I messaged Amy to say thanks for hosting my wife's bachelorette party and my wife found the message today and flipped out. Was I wrong to send that?"
58,"Only brother (35m) didn't ask me (32m) to be in his wedding party. Found out by overhearing conversation with mutual co-worker.


So my only brother is getting married in September. We've always been pretty close and have never had any falling outs or anything of that nature and we also work together.


I actually lived with him and his fiancee (22F) for about two years before moving to a new place last year to have more space and to give them the space they needed after getting engaged. 


The other day he was having a conversation about three feet away from me with a fellow co-worker about how he had the wedding party over the night before for a night of games. I have to admit I feel a bit hurt that he has apparently decided to not ask me to be a groomsmen nor even mention anything to me about it. I would totally get it if they wanted it to just be friends or whatever, but he never even thought to talk to me about it either 


I don't know if I should bring it up or just let it go. It just feels strange as we see each other regularly, have always had a good relationship and I even know his fiancee very well. Maybe it's just the initial hurt of it, but I definitely feel a bit in the dumps about it as he is most likely going to be my first choice for best man when I get married. Should I say anything or let it be?


TLDR; brother I work with and used to live with apparently doesn't want me in his wedding party and I found out through an overheard conversation that I wasn't asked. Should I say anything? "
59,"My BF (28/M) refuses to walk our puppy in the morning even though I've hurt my knee [and walk with a limp], just because we agreed that I would have ""daytime duties.""


My BF (28/M) of 5 years and I have recently gotten a German Shepherd puppy. She is 3.5 months old. It was a joint desire and decision. My BF was pressing for a German Shepherd, whereas I was happy to get a more manageable medium-sized dog from the shelter. 

&amp;#x200B;

My BF works between 8 and 5 PM daily, on weekdays. I have a flexible schedule as I am self-employed, but I work from an office space outside of our apartment. We agreed that I would have daytime duties and that he would take care of her upon return from work. 

&amp;#x200B;

However, I recently hurt my knee and it hurts to walk. I am wearing a brace. I am slow on our walks now, but it is okay. I still return home every day for two hours during my ""lunch break"" to take her on long walks through the park and practice obedience training. I then return to my office and work until 7 or 8 PM. 

&amp;#x200B;

I have asked him to wake up just 10 or 15 minutes earlier in order to walk her, just around the block even, so that she can potty outside. He refuses. He doesn't believe that my knee is in that bad of shape, and exclaims that it is not fair that he should walk her in the morning if we agreed I would have daytime duties. We have been fighting about this for days now. 

&amp;#x200B;

The other thing is that she wakes up as soon as he does, which is earlier than my wake-up time. It would make more sense for him to just take her down to the yard (we live on the fourth-floor) in the morning, for five minutes, versus me getting up and doing it just because I have ""daytime duties."" 

&amp;#x200B;

And now, even with my knee in pain, he still refuses to do so. 

&amp;#x200B;

This morning he said he was running late during yet another argument about this, and then he left and sat in his parked car for 10 MINUTES! prior to taking off. So, he was obviously not running late. 

&amp;#x200B;

He says that I am a ""princess"" and ""lazy,"" even though I don't see him returning from work during lunch to walk her for an hour everyday and train her. Even when he is home, he is constantly telling me to distract her so that he can do stuff around the house, whereas I do everything around the house just fine without asking him to restrain her. 

&amp;#x200B;

He thinks it's a ""luxury"" for me to take two hours off of my work schedule to come home and be with her. Sure, perhaps it is, in some sense, but it also a chore, which I have happily taken on, but still a chore, that takes time away from my job and makes it so that I have to spend late hours at the office, whereas before I was returning home at 5 PM. 

&amp;#x200B;

Also, many nights he only walks her ONCE and not twice, as she needs. He says ""Oh, she'll just pee in the bathroom,"" but with me he constantly pushes me to walk her first thing in the AM and he only walks her ONCE in the evening on most nights, and that for 10 MINUTES only! around the block. 

&amp;#x200B;

Am I being unfair in expecting that he walk her in the morning? To me, it makes logical sense. It would take just 10 or less minutes of his time. 

&amp;#x200B;

Ever since we got our puppy, we have been constantly fighting about our doggy-duties. It's getting to the point where we can't stand to be around each other. I try to avoid coming up on many nights till even later, just to avoid the stress of watching him get annoyed with the puppy wanting to play, nagging me to hold her, etc., etc. 

&amp;#x200B;

What do I do? How should I deal with this situation? His lack of empathy towards me being hurt is also hurtful. I imagine that a good boyfriend would just offer to do this, even if he believes it is my ""duty"" simply because I am also in pain and very slow to walk with my hurt knee. 

&amp;#x200B;

Thank you. 

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR: My BF (28/M) refuses to walk our puppy in the morning even though I've hurt my knee \[and walk with a limp\], just because we agreed that I would have ""daytime duties."" "
60,"UPDATE My [24m] wife [24f] of 4 years has a serious problem with me getting a tattoo


I realized the other day while going through my account that I never provided an update, which a few people had asked for. A lot has happened since then obviously, since it has been 8 months. I'll try to keep this relevant to the [original post](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/8njq98/my_24m_wife_24f_has_a_serious_problem_with_me). TL;DR at the bottom.

So, I posted back in June, and I had my tattoo appointment at the end of July. Turns out, I had scheduled it while she was away for school, which only made matters worse for a small while(to be fair, I did ask her if that date was okay, but she obviously didn't check before saying yes). So while she was gone, I got a tattoo of my daughter's foot and it was about a week old when she returned. She asked me how it was, how long it took, what it ended up costing, if it hurt, etc. I did compromise, not because she asked, but because I knew it would make her happier and I got it on my inner bicep so it is slightly hidden. She was rather nonchalant about it. Over the next month or so, every so often she would get really angry out of nowhere. She would stop talking to me, and provide really short responses to anything I asked her. If I pushed and asked her what was wrong, it was always because she caught a glimpse of my tattoo. She did resent me for those two months, which I completely understand since it wasn't just about the tattoo, but because I basically made this choice without her full consent. 

After that, it was smooth sailing with us. She started to like it, and appreciate the sentiment behind it. She liked that it wasn't the typical foot tattoo that you see, with a bit more of a cartoon look to it. At this point she was still holding onto the fact that I excluded her from this decision though, still not understanding that my ultimate desire/motive was bodily autonomy. That was an issue since I started breaching the topic of drinking with her as well(For those unfamiliar, alcohol is a big no-no in the Mormon religion). This resentment led to some additional trouble between us, because we suck at communicating. We have learned that we often speak/repress in order to avoid conflict or make the other person happy. We had a giant blow-out fight a few weeks after I breached the topic of drinking, and right after she found messages from me to my brothers(on a private hangouts chat) where I was making rude jokes about religion. We started seeing a counselor in October, and drinking/tattoos is a very common topic since it is the best example of my desire for bodily autonomy, and the lack of it within the bounds of my marriage. 


As for the issues with her family and my tattoo, I hit the nail on the head that it was her primary concern with everything. She was afraid of how they would react, that they would judge, or say mean comments to me. How many comments have we gotten regarding the tattoo? 0. From my family or her's. Literally not a single person has said anything(I wonder where we get our communication issues from when it comes to difficult topics...) I was also mostly right about how she would react to it. As mentioned above, she held onto some resentment, but once we got into a safe space in the counselor's office, and were able to speak more openly, she was able to come to terms with it. She is starting to understand me better, and I am understanding her better. We really are in a good place, as we continue to navigate our differences. Just the other day, she said that looking at my tattoo turned her on which resulted in us having sex. This is a huge deal, since my wife is not a very sexually active person. 

This has been a good journey, even with all the ups and downs. I think that going through this forced us into a position where we really had to have some hard conversations and it was the first push into the counselor's office. 

TL;DR: I got the tattoo, my wife was angry for a bit, but now it is a bit of a turn-on for her. We are currently in couples counselling, and it is going great. There has been absolutely no family drama as a result."
61,"How can I[M30] tell my BIL[M35] and my niece[F10] that I don't want to play Overwatch with them anymore without hurting them?


I play a lot of Overwatch and recently my BIL and my niece (age 10) got into it as well.  They ask me to play with them so I join them for some games.  It was awful.  BIL has almost no experience with games and can barely manage to move his character around the map let alone aim and use abilities so he spends half the game either dead or running back from spawn.  niece is only slightly better because she used to play games with me when she was really little and must have retained some of it, but she still spends a lot of time dead as well.  I figure this is just them getting used to the game and they'll get better with some practice.

Well a couple days later I get on and they invite me to a game.  I notice they've leveled up their accounts quite a bit so they must have been grinding games so I thought they must have improved as well.  Well they improved a little bit, but mostly just in the sense that they could move and shoot at the same time.  They still died a lot and our team got steamrolled since we were basically playing with a 2 player disadvantage.  We played about 10 games that night and we lost all but one of them.  By the end of that night I just felt so bad because I was annoyed and not having fun while they both seemed to be having a great time.  So I felt bad for losing a bunch AND guilty for not having fun with them.

I've tried giving them advice, but they either don't care or seem to forget it minutes later and go back to playing like they always do.  This is very frustrating for me because I understand its just a game and winning isn't everything, but playing with them just isn't fun in a competitive game like Overwatch.

I tried explaining to BIL a few times that I couldn't play with them that night because I was playing the ranked mode which prevents much lower ranked players from partying up with you and he just made me feel guilty for not wanting to play with them.  So for a couple weeks I just played in offline mode or avoided logging into the game when I knew they'd be online in order to get out of playing with them.  But after awhile BIL and niece both started texting me almost daily trying to get me to get on and play with them.

I got into Overwatch because it is fun to coordinate with other players and pull off wins when working together.  It was a ""me time"" activity before that I could use to unwind and have some fun after work, but now I feel like I'm not even allowed to enjoy it for myself anymore because they want me to play with them.  And suddenly all the things I enjoy about the game are out the window because they want to play the game differently.

Also as far as spending time with them since I assume this context will be important.  I spend a few nights a week over at their house playing boardgames and hanging out with them.  So I definitely do spend a decent amount of time around them and this isn't our only form of time spent together.

I'm at the point now where I feel like the only option left is to talk to BIL and let him know I don't want to play with them.   Problem is how can I do this?  I feel like no matter what I am going to look like a huge asshole because to them I'll be insulting them for not being good enough.   I definitely see it from their perspective and I can't blame them either.  

So in this situation what can I really do?

TL;DR: BIL and Niece got into a game I enjoy playing.  Game isn't fun to play with them for me and I am trying to find a way to communicate that without causing problems."
62,"My [22M] girlfriend [21F] said she wants to have sex with her friend.


First time poster, long time lurker. Throw away for obvious reasons.

My girlfriend and I made plans to hang out with some friends, 2 females and a male, all of which she’s been close friends with for a while. So, they got drunk and I sort of babysat for them since they drank so much, and eventually my girlfriend says, speaking to the other male friend I mentioned earlier, “David, I’d fuck you if nobody was around”. 

This took me by surprise and ruined the night for me, so much so that I actually wrote down what she said. I wasn’t going to start a full fledged argument about it because A) we were with friends and B) they were all shitfaced. Shortly after the first statement she made, she made a request - “David, fuck me.”

Now it is worth noting that, as I said above, they were all shitfaced. It’s also worth noting that David is a rather feminine guy, feminine build, even had a prior boyfriend, and is Bisexual. Lastly, I truly feel as though she was speaking her “drunken truth”. She said many things like how much she cares for me, how much she cares for her friends, etc. while she was drunk ranting, so I have good reason to believe she wasn’t just spewing nonsense and that there was *some* sort of coordination going on in her mind.

Anyways, it’s the morning after. Her friends reminded her of what she said and she is shocked. She says she doesn’t know why she said these things as she doesn’t feel this way about David - at least her sober self doesn’t, according to her. 

I’m not entirely sure how to react to this. Obviously I’m pretty upset and feel somewhat insecure. She was literally holding my hand as she said these things to David, not sure if she was aware of it though.

Any type of feedback/advice on this issue would be greatly appreciated.

TL;DR: Drunk girlfriend said she wanted to fuck her close male friend, right to his face.

"
63,"For a while I (M25) have blamed mine and my wife’s (F25) inability to build friendships on life getting in the way. Starting to think it’s not just that.


Hi all. 

Just short backstory here. My wife and I met about 3.5 years ago and married last year. We currently have a son who is getting close to turning 2 years old. Since meeting, moving in, building a life together, we’ve seen a lot of our old friendships fall away. I know that for a lot of friends I used to have, moving away and honestly doing some growing up caused me to drift apart from them. 

We still have 2 mutual friends who hang out with us probably once a month. We have discussed in the past a yearning to have more friends. We live a fairly quiet life. A lot of people our age don’t have kids and go out quite often, something we feel would be somewhat irresponsible of us to do with a kiddo. The only time I go out is when I’m playing with a band I’m in for money and I do see my other band mates as friends but perhaps not on the level I’d like. 

In summer of 2018 I thought I had an opportunity to make much better friends with a guy I went to high school with. We’re gonna call him Tim. I’ll preface this with it didn’t work out and I sort of felt used on the whole thing. He reaches out to me about life insurance. I’ll spare the details, I sign up and get a feeling that there might be genuine good to come of this. His wife calls me up one day and actually invites me to a surprise birthday party for him which I attend and things seem awesome. 

I proceed to not hear from Tim for a few months until it’s time for my son’s birthday. Tim has a young son as well and his birthday was right around the time our son has his. We send an invite to Tim and his wife. She proceeds to call my wife saying that they won’t be able to attend our son’s birthday due to all the family being in town. Fine, I understand. She then tells my wife that she has a gift for our son. 

My wife, son, and myself attend their kiddo’s birthday party and it’s littered with people, a lot of whom I went to high school with. I go over to a table of people just to say hi and I feel pretty much ignored. My wife and I stay long enough to have a plate and leave. We have never heard from Tim or his wife since and we’ve pretty much decided that the only reason he reached out to me in the first place was to improve his sales for his job. So I’ve pretty much decided that that isn’t happening. 

More recently, I had a few people from where I used to work discuss possibly hanging out more often. We all worked for an IT company that went under but we were pretty tight knit while there. I was in group chats and everything and expressed my interest in hanging out. I found out today after messaging one of the group that everyone except for myself and one other person had already gone out to a bar earlier this month. The opinion of this other person is somewhat negative and I got the same treatment they did. The person I messaged basically asked if I wanted an invite for next time and I’m pretty much set on not responding because I’m upset by the deal. I did end up messaging the other person not invited just telling them how I appreciated my time working with them and that I hope they’re doing well. 

I feel rejected. Short of doing the classic baking a pie and going around the neighborhood where I live, I have no idea how to make friends anymore and I’m sort of worried I’m wildly off putting in some way that people aren’t telling me about. I understand that things are supposed to slow down somewhat once you have a kid and move about 45 minutes away from where you grew up but this is kind of depressing for me. 

I want to know what others in a similar life situation have done to make friends or maybe just similar stories to this to know I’m not alone on it. 

Tl;Dr Just having trouble making/maintaining friendships. Not getting invited to things. Worried I’m a hot mess that no one wants to be around. "
64,"My [33M] significant other [37F] is refusing to give me full transparency with her financials.


I am at a bit of a loss here, but I guess I am looking for some sort of validation in what I am asking for. My SO and I have been together for about 8 years. I have a beautiful step daughter with her and we are for the most part, a normal family. We have had our fair share of ups and downs and have sought counseling for issues we have had in the past to help us communicate better than we had been.

About 6 months ago my SO was adamant about her being put on my bank account, moving all her funds into our now joint bank account(we also share a savings account) and us having just one monthly budget spreadsheet. I was originally against this because I was the only one doing a consistent budget for each pay period. My SO's ""philosophy"" on a budget is that she would only need to do it once and never again, which we have argued about numerous times since I have years of per pay period budget written up and know where my pay checks are going. One of the stipulations of this joint account between us was that she was going to help with the budget monthly. She did help with the original joint monthly budget but since has not mentioned nor helped with our monthly budget after the first one we made, which is very frustrating for me since I have am now responsible for everything on our new joint budget.

When my SO started using our(my) new joint banking account for all her banking needs she kept her old account open for our daughter for her baby sitting jobs(it's an app, like the uber app for baby sitting). My daughters father had passed away several years ago and she receives his social security checks through my SO's old account. Well recently I have noticed that my daughter always has money for things and I started asking myself where the money came from since my SO assured me that the checks our daughter was receiving in her old account were going straight to a college fund. Since I had provided my SO with full transparency into my life financially, I wanted to ask for the same so I could see with my own eyes where the money is going to make sure our daughter has a nice little college fund.

This morning on the way to work I called my SO to let her know that I would like access to the account so we could both have full transparency financially and was met with a hard no. My SO's reasoning is that the account is our daughters and not relevant. After again asking her for full transparency she continued to refuse, and for me it was such a refusal that I almost feel like she is hiding something. After about 5 minutes of back and fourth she basically told me that it was ""none of my business, this is my daughter"". I let her know sharply that ""it is my business, I am your SO and you have a full view of financials and for some reason I am not allowed to view all of yours."" We went back and fourth repeating the same things because she ended the call.

I am very confused right now. I thought we were a team? I did not want to join accounts, but I did it for her. I did not want to be the only one doing the budget, but I am. Right now I feel like this whole thing was so she could watch over me through our now joined account. Am I being irrational by wanting access to her other account to see if the money is going where it needs to go, or is this a control thing on her end since she can keep a watchful eye on me? I am at a loss for words about some of the things that were said earlier and thinking we might not be as much of a team a I thought we were.

TL;DR My SO has 100% view over my financials, but she is refusing to give me the same because it's ""none of my business""

65,"My (28M) wife (27F) is wanting to have her family to live with us and I'm panicking


 

So, a bit of backstory, my mother-in-law (50ish?F) recently became very sick (terminally) and needs to be taken care of. No problem, she needs it, it's fine. But now I found out that she wants her sister to live with us as well. Her sister has special needs and needs to be monitored constantly so she doesn't hurt herself. She used to live in a group home but stuff happened that I won't go into and now they want her out.

Now, I can handle moving my mother-in-law down short notice and getting her set up in our current place. But her sister requires more space and is additional moving expenses that I have to cover on my own. No one else in this makes enough to cover it and I'm not even sure I do to be honest. All the spaces to have 3 bedrooms to accommodate are waaay out of our price range and even though she keeps telling me that her mom's and sister's disability money means they can chip in a bit, I have no idea how long her mom will be with us. After she's gone, I still need to make sure we can afford whatever place we end up in. When I've brought up the price issue she's responded with something along the lines of ""Fine, if we don't find a place with all the needs, I'll move out and live with them on my own"" but she phrases it nicely like it'll be like doing me a favor.

Now for the more personal problems. I'm a severe introvert. I need time to myself and space after hanging out with people or I go into a deep depression. I can handle my wife being around because she is able to support me when I'm feeling that way (Married her for a reason) but I keep thinking about my life with four people in the house and I go into a full blown panic attack. I'm also worried that because her sister needs 24/7 attention, my wife and I will never be able to have a date or intimate time together because one of us always needs to be home. The worst part about all of this is I know it sounds shitty. I know that I really am a bad person for feeling this way but I can't help it and because I feel this way about it, I can't even bring these concerns up to my wife because I will feel like the most selfish person in the world.

I'm feeling desperate and I don't know what to do.  


TL;DR: my wife's family is moving in and I feel like all the financial burden is being thrust on me with very little say in the matter. I also am experiencing feelings that I know are very selfish and bad and don't know how to deal with them."
66,"My [23F] housemate [22F]put a used pantyliner on my dishware and hid it in her (my) room



Long story short—I have a family friend who lives in my family home. We found out she flunked school and since her foreign parents already blew 100K on her, my parents decided to take her in. 

I live away from my parents house during the school year but every now and then I visit my parents. 

Said family friend uses my personal washroom when I’m away from home. I found out last time I came home that she finished my face wash and diluted it with water so I wouldn’t notice. I’m livid.

She also used my panty liners, I know because she put a used one on a plate on my dresser. She stays in the room I normally do. I’m angry because we took her in because she’s a fuck up and this is how she repays is? No respect. I want to blow up and go nuts but maybe that wouldn’t be the most tactile thing to do.

**TL;DR:** I found out that my family friend who is staying at my house used my face wash and diluted it with water so I wouldn’t know. I’m livid! I want to blow up and go nuts but that wouldn’t be the most tactile thing to do."
67,"Boyfriend made me uncomfortable last night but I can’t tell if I’m overreacting


I’ve been dating my boyfriend for about a year now and we were good friends for about 6 years before we started dating.

About 6 months into the relationship, I caught him sexting and exchanging pics with a girl who he assured me over and over again was just his friend. Before this event I was pretty chill and not easily jealous. I became insecure after finding the messages. He begged me to give him another chance and I did. He gave me the passwords to his Facebook, deleted snap and IG (ALL his idea),  and became very transparent with me to try and make up for what happened. He put in a lot of effort and still does and it shows but he did something last night that made me really uncomfortable but idk if I’m just overreacting cause I’m still insecure from the previous event 

Basically a bunch of us were hanging out at the bar and he randomly started giving our good friend (let’s call her Beth) a massage. She’s super nice and pretty and I don’t think anything is going on between them but it just made me soooooo uncomfortable and I started spiralling thinking “can I ever really actually trust this guy?” I think he saw I was getting uncomfortable and stopped but I was already bothered by it. We haven’t really said much to eachother since last night 


Ugh I don’t wanna be like this. It’s really not a big deal right? but it is bothering me so much. Am I overreacting here? How do I get over this. 

Tl;dr insecure from bf cheating means I can’t tell if what he did last night was weird or if I’m just overreacting "
68,"Me [30F] with my parents [61F and 66M] - having trouble coming up with a realistic retirement plan with them


I'll start out with a bit of background on our family. I \[30F\] am an attorney earning well over $150K a year. My husband \[32M\] earns a similar amount with his (equally demanding) job, so we are able to live very comfortably. We currently have one child \[2F\] and will be looking to expand our family with one or two more children in the near future. 

I have one older brother \[42M\] who I am not close with. He is notoriously stingy and has already made it clear that, however I choose to help our parents, I am on my own.

My parents \[61F and 66M\] have always been very bad with money. My father always earned a good salary, comparable to mine, and my mother never really had to work. While I don't know all the details of their finances, I know enough to say that they kept up with the Joneses all their lives and wasted money trying to compete with their millionaire friends whose lifestyles were simply unattainable for them. I do know they don't own their home (they move around too much; I believe they have 25 years left on their current mortgage), they have little to no savings or investments, and they both drive very expensive cars they do not own outright. Their home is also a constant source of stress for them; they insist on living in a 5-bedroom mini-mansion despite being empty nesters. Thankfully they do not have any credit card debt, as far as I'm aware.

My dad is disabled from a car accident he was in as a teen and with age, it's starting to severely limit his mobility. My parents are starting to have serious talks about his retirement, but they have absolutely no plan for how to live once the income stream shuts off. Basically, they're delusional, expecting that they'll be able to live the same lifestyle they've been living for the past 40+ years without having to adjust at all. They fully expect to be able to keep their cards and their huge house. They are adamant about not going to a shitty nursing home and insist that if they need care in the future, it must be done through an in-home care provider or that I'll have to care for them myself.

I am not willing to do either of those things. As I said, I have my own family that my husband and I are looking to expand, and we simply have neither the room or the time to care for both toddlers and aging parents. We do have money in our budget to support them in a decent nursing home or assisted living facility - but we cannot provide the expensive in-home care that they want, and they certainly can't pay for it themselves. Every attempt i've made to have a rational, realistic discussion about this with them is met with fits and hysterics, accusing me of being a bad daughter and wanting to put them in a shithole where they'll be abused. I have no idea how to come up with a plan that they're okay with but is doable for us financially.

Note: I will eventually be making a more in-depth financial post over on /r/personalfinance. Right now I'm looking for advice on the more human side of this - how to break it to my parents that they aren't going to be able to have the retirement they want, and how to work together to come up with a realistic plan instead.

\*\*tl;dr: Parents are bad with money, have little savings, but expect to have a wealthy retirement and expensive in-home care which I cannot afford. Will not work with me to come up with a more reasonable retirement plan for them.\*\*"
69,"My [30,F] partner [30,M] vaguebooking our dirty laundry after a big fight


Hi, long time lurker.

My husband and I have been having problems in our marriage that keep resurfacing. I would say we have a real communication issue, and our fights, albeit infrequent, start with him being inexplicably rude to me (in my opinion), and end up with me losing my temper and yelling because he won't stop literally scoffing and being dismissive. We have small kids, and I hate arguing like that.

We had this huge fight and I basically told him to get out, at least for the afternoon. He refuses but later takes the car and doesn't return til late. I see he's posting on Facebook about his fancy dinner but he is ""depressed because he is sick of his wife who is a big baby"" (rough translation as was in his native tongue - possible he also thinks I won't understand exactly what he has written but just know he has written something.)

We are going to go to counselling soon, the appointment was already booked, but I was already thinking that maybe our issue was insurmountable and it would be best to seperate.

But now he's posting things like that publicly to try and shame me I guess, at least to the friends and family from his home country. Is this the act that should tip the scales? I've calmed down from yesterday but now I'm feeling pretty disgusted by this behaviour. Plus instead of coming to me and talking, just trying to double down and add fuel to the fire. He's done it once before ages ago and I told him at the time I felt it was immature and disrespectful. Just feeling pretty helpless and sad and don't know what to do.

Tl;dr Husband telling his friends and family on Facebook I am a big baby after a huge fight. Confused and sad and feeling incredibly disrespected. Am I justified in feeling this way about this, or am I overreacting? (to the Facebook problem specifically)"
70,"My (30M) wife (29F) says I shouldn't be upset about her ""friendship"" with her coworker


Throwaway for obvious reasons. 

My (30M) wife (29F, married 3 yrs) has worked with another man for a few years (I don't know how long). Around a year ago I noticed that my wife would talk to him a lot outside of work. We talked about it, I mentioned that it bugged me, and she assured me they were just friends. She also promised to be cognizant of how much they were talking and agreed to focus on us instead of her phone when we're spending time together. 

A few months later she was talking to me about him and mentioned some sexually explicit things he had told her. I told her that it made me uncomfortable that they were having sexually explicit conversations and she promised to set appropriate boundaries and keep their future conversations work-appropriate.

A couple of months later she told me that the conversations about sexual topics hadn't stopped and he had ""accidentally"" sent her lewd pictures he claimed were meant for someone else (not pics of him). She said she told me because I would be upset if I found out about it otherwise. We talked about it again, she agreed that things had crossed the line, and she agreed to tell him that their future conversations had to be work-appropriate.

This past weekend he apparently called her when I was at work and was ""freaking out."" She invited him over (45-ish min away) and they got dinner together. Apparently the sexual conversations never stopped and this conversation focused on his sex life (he wanted to talk about a girl he had been sleeping with and he was concerned he had gotten an STI from her). She says she did nothing wrong because they're just friends and he never came in the house.

As a backdrop to all of this, they travel for work together (sometimes just the two of them) and I know she's been lying to me about how often they're talking (I've inadvertently caught her a handful of times). I'm trying to give her the full benefit of the doubt but it's difficult. I'm simultaneously feeling like I'm overreacting and being too naive. She's telling me I'm out of line and they're just friends. 

Am I out of line to be upset? Even if they're just friends, I feel like my discomfort was reasonable but I was just ignored and I was lied to about their relationship. 

TL;DR: My wife is having sexual conversations with a co-worker (and lying about it) and inviting him over but says I shouldn't be upset."
71,"My [32 F] parents [60s] are giving my brother [38 M] cash which is going to nothing but weed. He refuses to work. Am I being unreasonable to stop contact with my parents so they will stop giving my brother money for drugs?


I really don't know what to do. I fear my brother will be homeless when my parents die. He told me that he refuses to take any job that will pay him less than $150k/year because he has a master's degree. He constantly tells me the world is going to end so there's no point in working and that robots will take over.

I really don't know what to do. I think weed is exacerbating some sort of mental illness he must have. He refuses to get help and tells everyone else that they are crazy. My parents pay all his bills and give him cash. I told them to cut back and just pay his rent/food but don't give him the cash for weed so he might sober up. My parents refuse to do this because they are scared of my brother. I told them to just move away from him and don't give him gas money. I don't know what to do. I feel a lot of guilt/pressure that he might become homeless when my parents die because I don't have the ability to pay his bills. It makes me so frustrated with my parents and I feel like they're taking the easy way out. 

I want to cut contact with my parents because I live in a different country and I feel like they are leaving me with the burden of paying for my brother when they die rather than trying to stop enabling him at the moment. Am I being unreasonable to cut contact with my parents?


Tldr: Am I being unreasonable for cutting contact with my parents until they stop enabling my drug addicted brother?"
72,"I [23F] had an “accident” in a guy’s [24M] bed after having sex with him for the first time. Unsure how to proceed.


I’ve had a crush on this guy FOREVER. We have mutual friends but were never romantically involved until now. We finally ended up hooking up. It was amazing. Until I realized that my period had come on. (Normally I would know it’s coming way ahead of time. But I had been sick before which sometimes makes my cycle go out of whack and it came on unexpectedly). 

I didn’t even notice until he turned on the lights. He was just like “uh I need to go to the bathroom” and I guess he was washing himself up based on how long the water was running. When he came out finally he didn’t say much. It was so awkward. I just apologized and said I had to go. Got my clothes on and basically sprinted out of his apartment. 

That was 4 days ago. We haven’t talked since. I probably should have offered to help clean up his sheets or something. But I was so humiliated that I just froze. Not sure if there’s any way to fix this now. I want to text him but I have no clue what to say...

I really like him but I’m worried it’s over now. 

TLDR: Cycle came on unexpectedly during a hook up. Want to repair things with the guy but unsure how.  "
73,"I planned a late Valentine’s Day surprise for my boyfriend and he stood me up


My boyfriend and I have been dating for almost 3 years. We have a great relationship and I want to spend the rest of my life with him. Lately are relationship feels a little blah. We do the same things over and over again and stay home a lot. So I wanted to spice things up. Yesterday on actual valentines day I had class all day and he had work so we figured we would see each other this weekend. We had no set plans but we agreed he would come over tonight. I made him a Valentine’s Day basket with a bunch of his favorite things, bought lingerie (which I’ve never done before), and baked cookies. 
I spent all day preparing for his arrival. I shaved in places I didn’t even know I had hair. I cleaned my entire apartment. I did my hair the way he likes it. I painted my toe nails. I asked Reddit the best way to surprise him with the lingerie. I had to bake the cookies THREE times cause I suck and messed them up twice. i set his gifts and cookies up on the table so he’d see it right when he walked in, dimmed the lights, and lit a bunch of candles waiting for his arrival. So I’m sitting here in my apartment waiting in my lingerie with a robe on putting together a sex music playlist when he calls me and tells me he’s too tired from work to come. I said it was ok. And that was that. 

I know I’m like throwing myself a pity party right now because he obviously doesnt know about the surprise and I didn’t try to convince him to come over. But I shouldn’t have to try and convince him. Yesterday was Valentine’s Day and I didn’t get to see him and he didn’t send me flowers or anything so he should’ve been here. But I know his job is tiring because he works for fedex. I don’t know. Sorry for rambling. 


TLDR: spent a long time planning a small surprise for my boyfriend and he stood me up because he was tired from work "
74,"Went on a date with guy (m28) who is now angry I (f26) don't have a 'good reason' why I won't date him again. Am I wrong?


I (f26) recently went on a date with a co-worker (I know, I know, terrible idea!) who I thought I had a lot in common with. 

The date...wasn't terrible. But it wasn't great. Turns out we do have a lot in common, but I was put off when he started talking about our (not his, OUR) future plans together and how he wants to quit his job soon so he can spend more time with ""the new woman in his life"" (he pointed at me). He made a few more awkward comments about how he doesn't really fit in with society, and how he thinks he's smarter than everyone else in the company and wishes he could run everything, etc. I ended up cutting the date short and told him I'm not really interested in continuing to date him. I thought that was the end of it.

The next day he called me and demanded to know why I didn't want to go out with him again, when the date went really well in his opinion. I told him that I'm not interested in a relationship with him and didn't feel like we clicked. I also said I have a lot going on in my life that I have to deal with before I start seriously dating anyone (not entirely untrue). He said that isn't a ""good enough reason"". I said I didn't know what to say and he hung up.

Then a few days later, we were working the same day and he ""accidentally"" found me (we work in different departments so it's rare that we see each other. I suspect he intentionally sought me out) and asked again why I'm not interested in dating him and to give him another chance. I repeated the same thing to him and he called me 'immature' and walked off. He's now ignoring me and I'm starting to feel like an ass. 

Should I have been more honest with him? I didn't really want to tell him that his weird comments about out future and his ego is what put me off, especially since he seems to have gotten weirdly aggressive about why he was turned down. I didn't know if that would set him off. 

tl;dr - Went on a date with a guy but didn't click. I told him I'm not interested in dating him, and he doesn't think that's a ""good enough"" reason. 
"
75,"I [26F] seem to reach this dead end in every relationship and I'm there again with my current bf [30M] of 2.5 years.


I've been in 2 relationships before this one where exactly at the 2.5 year mark, I had broken up with my exes rather suddenly. I have been with my current BF for 2.5 years now, and I want out. Some background:

&amp;#x200B;

I honestly don't have anything bad to say about my boyfriend John\*. He is a kind, loyal and loving person who genuinely cares about his friends and family and me. He is very intelligent, has a great job and career, great with managing his money, and we have a lot of common interests (we go to the gym/yoga together, read/listen a lot of the same books/podcasts). Our sex life is also very mutually satisfying, no complaints there. Emotional intimacy is also great as we lean on each other through hard times. On paper, he's perfect. I'd like to think that I also put a lot of effort into myself in terms of fitness/appearance/career/qualities as a girlfriend to keep him happy and satisfied. So we seem like a decent match, right? 

&amp;#x200B;

Well, I think I've realized a major incompatibility that I can't let go of and I strongly feel like he is not the one (don't necessary believe in ""the one"" but I mean he's not the one I should marry). We have been talking about marriage usually led by me in the past, and he has hinted at getting engaged this year which I was very happy and onboard with before I started feeling this way. This feeling is....sort of familiar to me. In my past two relationships, both of which lasted the same amount of time, I got this feeling of sudden disinterest and detachment from my boyfriends and promptly went through with ending the relationship (in as gentle a way as possible, I certainly didn't show my sudden ""detachment""). In those instances, it was definitely the right decision as clearly, I don't regret it. I feel the same recurring pattern happening again with John, but for different reasons and I need help figuring out if this is a ""me"" thing or if the relationship is really doomed. 

&amp;#x200B;

The biggest reasons in my mind that I feel like I know for a fact we won't last in a marriage, is because we are different types of people. Despite having almost identical views and values (atheists, egalitarian couple, same views on how to raise kids etc.), as far as temperament goes, we are different. He is a pretty serious guy most of the time, unless he's with his buddies or usually when he's with me. He sometimes makes dad jokes, but other than a light chuckle, he doesn't really make me laugh. I think I've realized how important being with someone who can make me laugh is. I know we probably have different senses of humour. We do enjoy similar stand up comedies and comedic shows though, but I always laugh more while he doesn't but still enjoys watching with me. I've realized we also don't have banter like I had with my exes. He thinks it's awesome that we ""act like silly children"" when we're together, but we aren't nearly as silly as I am with my friends or was with my exes. In fact it's a complaint of mine, whereas for him ours seems like his most non-serious relationship? My friends and I do ridiculous things that make me cry of laughter....I do not have that with my BF. We have like, a couple inside jokes that he loves and references frequently, but to me it's almost not enough? The other thing that bothers me that sort of relates, is that as a result of different senses of humour, he doesn't seem to ""click"" with my friends and family. He can have conversations with them but always talks about things like work, or the housing market, or the news instead of a more light-hearted funny conversation that my friends/family also love to have.  He never jokes with anyone other than his own friends...barely ever with me. I've told him in the past how much I love if he playfully made fun of me or called me out on my silly/dumb mistakes or whatnot. He did it for like a couple weeks but then it faded again. There have been many times where I excitedly tell him something hilarious that happened and he either has his signature fake laugh or he has such an underwhelming reaction. We have great conversations together and we usually have fun together, but I really really miss the banter and laughter and poking fun at each other. I can't even make fun of him because he's pretty sensitive? Like,  I think he'll know I'm joking but he just won't find it funny. 

&amp;#x200B;

I've started to notice this after our honeymoon period wore off around the 1.5-2 year mark. This all came to a head when we went on a triple date with two of my best friends and he kept zoning out of the conversations we were having and I felt a little embarrassed that he just wasn't laughing along when everyone else was. But when he's with his friends, he fully participates in all their inside jokes and laughs along with all of them. He doesn't stand out as the ""serious"" one in those instances with his friends. I've talked to him about how much the friend thing bothers me and he claims he was just very tired at the triple date because he barely slept the night before so he was out of it, otherwise he wouldn't have been like that. I told him that it's fine and I understand, but I'm not entirely convinced that's why. 

&amp;#x200B;

Because I love him very much and I WANT to try to make this relationship work instead of jumping ship like before, I'd really like some insight and advice on what I can do. I know open communication is important and I've talked to him about this but found it really difficult to say to him that he's not funny/doesn't enjoy my sense of humour. Judging from things he's said about what he loves about our relationship in the past, he does NOT see it the same way at all. I don't want to hurt him. He gave me a wonderful Valentine's day card saying he is looking forward to our future and he loves me more everyday. I feel trapped and am starting to have these panicky feelings where I don't know what to do. I don't want to end this relationship again as I do love him very very much and I am hoping some of my feelings are the dreaded pattern repeating itself, but I want to get through it this time with John. Is there anything we can do to put us on the right track? My parents are divorced and it's one of my biggest fears so I think that's why I am having these sudden and intense feelings of wanting to break up so as not to reach that point.

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR: I'm worried my BF and I aren't compatible after all in terms of sense of humour/banter and it's really bothering me when it comes to him around my family and friends. I wonder if this would lead to a divorce down the line if we got married, even though all other areas of our life are satisfying to us both. Is this something that can be salvaged, because I really would like to work this out if possible. "
76,"My (26m) wife (26f) gives a lot of money away to our church. I'm all for helping a good cause, but think it's too much.


My wife and I met in church. Throughout our relationship, we've always donated 10% of our income to the church. We dated for 4 years and have been married for 3. 

Over the years, I've drifted away from religion. While I don't mind giving some money to a church because they do a lot of good things with it most of the time (helping low income families, food drives for homeless, etc.) 10% of our income seems like too much to me. We're not in a financially bad spot, but the money would certainly be an increase in our standard of living and help us reach our goals faster, such as saving for a house. 

I've brought it up to her a couple times that I want to give less, but she won't budge at all. It's becoming more frustrating as time goes on and I don't want to keep giving the money away for the rest of my life. I do make substantially more than my wife, but believe finances in a marriage are a joint discussion/issue. 

Since I was initially on board for giving away the money when we were dating, am I in the wrong here? Is there any way I can convince my wife to give less? 

TL;DR - My wife gives away more money than I want to, but won't budge after I ask her to give away less. How do I convince her to give less? If I'm in the wrong in this situation, how do I get over it? "
77,"My Autistic husband (36M) is unintentially causing emotional abuse


My husband of 5 years is autistic, we didn't know this when we first got married but I did know something was off like throwing the mouse against the wall when it lagged and extreme anxiety. But I accepted his differences and he promised before we got married he would continue to date me. He had emotionally abusive parents who we think we're on the spectrum as well that caused him a hypercritical ego as well and other issues. This guy freaks out when he spills milk, like he is a failure. But things were okay until we had kids.  Man panics when he hears loud noise (ugh and he doesn't want to wear ear plugs and yells at the kids when happy instead). He has like 20 panic attacks a day, he is constantly stressed over the same things and routine. He spends all the time he can on his phone. Because of RSD (rejection sensitive dysphoria) he doesn't remember the postive things I say (which is more than negative) and unintentially gaslights all the time saying that all I do is critisize. I feel like I'm damned if I do or I'm damned if I don't. 

He got DXed with autism and ADD when our son did. We noticed similarities and I held his hand through it and reserached everything there is to know about autism from nonableist sources and science like learning channelopathy issues causing celluar overload that cause meltdowns etc. I understand the pain of misophonia and know he cant help how he feels but also I do know he can help how he reacts. Especially with the use of mindfulness techniques and DBT. I've begged him to get help because the level of anxiety and 15 panic attacks a day is a cry for help. He sees a GP for buspar and Adderall but I think he needs a psychiatrist and a therapist and I can't make those appointments for him. 

I'm lost I don't know what to do. I want to support him through this and wait until he unpacks his issues so I can have the man I had before. He isn't doing this on purpose. But he didn't keep his vow of dating me. He treats me like me making conversation is annoying or doesnt listen to a word I'm saying. All he does is panic and stress that's the only emotion he shows. I don't mind him working through it but I need more shades other than red. I'm so lonely. He is a great guy but I don't know if I can do another decade of him saying he will try to do better without taking steps to do so. 

But this is where I'm stuck, the birth of my first child (who is 3) left me physically disabled. I unknowingly had a condition called Elher Danlos Syndrome. Childbirth can be dangerous for us. So he has picked up childcare slack for me without complaint. He trys hard. I see that and compliment him pointlessly everyday still. I'm going through the stress if being abled body to being stuck at home. I'm suffering with this new me and I just want home to feel safe and be a place of support. If I'm not physically well, all I have is my mental well being.  So if I divorce I won't be able to work and being poor scares me because of my children. But it's hard to live with someone who panics every second or ingores you on their phone. I litterally have PTSD from him and internally freak out when the dogs bark or the baby cries. His anxiety comes out as anger. How do I fix this? What do I do? Is leaving him ableist? Should I continue to fight? I worry about feeling as lonely as I am 10 years from now and this his go to plan of meds isn't going to unpack what he needs to be mentally well.

We haven't had a blow up or big fight but I'm considering if sleeping in the guest bedroom tonight so I don't get down about being ignored. I try not to care about him as much. But I fear it'll trigger his RSD and cause fallout. Is that too petty?

TLDR my Autistic husband has panic attacks all day every day and it's affecting my well being. I'm considering leaving but worry about the kids, money since I'm disabled, and being abliest. Don't know if I should keep fighting for us. He is a good guy but toxic because if his issues he don't have a handle on.

78,"How do I [30M] convince my dad [60M] to stop sending all his money to his siblings in another country?


My father is a refugee who came to this country over 40 years ago. His, now late mother, and his siblings are all back in their old country.


We are what I would consider the working poor Our life has never been comfortable but have never been close to starving or homelessness.


My father has been sending $10000-15000back to his siblings and mother each year or couple years as far as I can remember. Because of that, our family has gotten nowhere. We share a home with 9 other people and his retirement savings is around $2000.


He works two jobs, waking up at 2AM and getting to bed by 11PM every night. He is a hard worker and never complains.


I understand him supporting his mother but I feel like his siblings take advantage of him. They always seem to have emergencies that require money. He has paid of his brother's gambling debts in the past and now they want $40000 to build a new house.


He is a family man and I get it. It's his flesh and blood, and if our family were wealthy, I would have no qualms about him supporting them financially. The issue I have is that he has no retirement savings, and no time for looking after his health and my mother's (who has chronic illnesses)


Myself, I am a working professional and should do okay I hope. I feel like it is my responsibility to support my parents in old age however, I still feel upset that my father's siblings keep mooching off him.


In fact, to send the money, my parents are going to have to take out a loan. I wanted to give him an ultimatum and tell him to not send the money but I'm afraid that would just cause him to be secretive and possibly go to loan sharks instead.


I want to deal with this in a more healthy manner because I've read how when you punish kids, all it does it makes them less close to you, more secretive, and resort of lying.


What do you think is the best way to go about this?


**TL;Dr**

* My father is a refugee who sends all his excess money back home including paying his brother's gambling debts for over 40 years and has no retirement savings.


* They are asking for $40K this year which he is planning on taking out a loan.


* How do I convince him to stop and start looking after himself?

79,"My [21F] boyfriend [21M] is currently passed out drunk on my floor, not sure what to say when he wakes up


My boyfriend of a few years went out with friends tonight. It was originally just going to be a small thing, but he was convinced to go out to a nightclub. All afternoon i texted him to remember to not drink much and to make it home early since he's working at 5am tomorrow.

Anyways, he comes home at 8 (thank god it wasn't any later) but was absolutely drunk. More drunk than I've ever seen him. I immediately took him to the bathroom where he began throwing up and didn't stop for the next two hours. I was having to wash out his buckets of vomit because they were spilling everywhere. After that i tried to get some fluids in him and get him to bed but he was barely even keeping his eyes open. I've set up a bunch of towels and blankets on the floor of my bathroom and put him in the recovery position. He's been sleeping there for the last few hours. I woke him up a little while ago but he was barely able to open his eyes and still could barely drink any water.

He's completely smashed his phone, he has to get up in a few hours for work (hes working an 11 hr day) and he's just a mess. I'm so frustrated and angry right now. I called a friend and she said to go easy on him since it happens to everyone. I'm hoping posting here and hearing what some of you guys think will help me sort out my feelings about it. For a while there i was worried he had alcohol poisoning and that i would have to call an ambulance. Now I'm thinking I'll have to call his work for him and tell them he's sick. I'm so upset at his lack of responsibility. I'm probably going to have to stay up most of the night to check in on him.

What should i say to him when he wakes up? I was planning on just getting all his stuff ready for him so that he can at least go to work if he's able to and then waiting until tomorrow night before I bring it up at all. I don't know if I'm just overreacting. I've gotten super drunk in the past but never this bad, and never when I had responsibilities the next day. It's just so stupid.

TL;DR boyfriend is passed out drunk on the floor, has to work in a few hours. Not sure how to process the frustration I'm feeling right now"
80,"Need advice, I'm(23m) moving in with my girlfriend (21f) of 3 years and I know we're already going to have arguments..


Our relationship has been great aside from the fact that we've been long distance the entire time (2 hours away) and we finally can move it together, which is exciting! 

However, I have some concerns, the only things I requested of her that she try to start doing when I get there is have a clearner room because she is a total mess. Like not see the entire floor or surface messy, which bothers me so I asked her if she couldn't be so messy, she said okay and has been ""trying to clean it for the past month.... And the other thing was I need a desk for my gaming rig we agreed, however shes talking about how she's happy to have a desknow instead of doing it on the bed and I said that she can use it as long as I don't want to use my PC (I was hoping to have that desk area kindof be where I have all of my stuff) and she said that her homework is more important, so I suggested 2 chairs at the desk so we would avoid conflict, but apparently that's a dumb idea,

 I know these are minor things and that when living with someone you have to change your habits a bit to accommodate them but I don't think I'm being unrealistic, am I?

81,"Boyfriend[27M] made out with my [25F] best friend [25F] they claim to be poly and can be contained, what do I do?


This is a throwaway because I don't want it coming back to my personal account. 

So I've been with my \[25F\] boyfriend Max \[27M\] for six years. We are living together for about a year now and both have stable, and successful careers. I consider us to be a pretty great team by all counts. I won't bore you all with the details as I know this is how all these posts start. And here it is.... BUT there has been something that has been bothering be and I don't really know where to go to get an outside, honest, perspective. We are really close friends with this couple (engaged Sarah \[25F\] and Kyle \[28M\]), been friends with them for as long as we have been dating and actually met through them. I'm best friends with the girl since undergrad (before dating Max) and same with the boys.  

So last year I was away on a business trip and we were roommates with Sarah and Kyle at the time. Apparently a movie was being watched, drinks were had and Sarah and Max started cuddling (with Kyle also on the couch but not participating) and things got past friendly from what I've been told. Sarah and Kyle stopped what they were doing and went on a walk and talked, apparently things were getting to far but they admit that they loved each other and could be polyamorous for each other. I get back in town a couple days later and a couple days after that Max tells me what happened between him and Sarah. I was fully upset, felt like I was living a cliche. I honestly considered ending it with Max and the friendship with Sarah. Sarah almost broke up with Kyle because she felt that Kyle was suffocating her and they had grown apart, but they ended up staying together. Also - apparently Kyle is okay with Sarah being with Max and us being poly. 

So Max said being poly was something that he is but if I wasn't willing then I was still his first priority and that avenue was closed. My main issue with everything was that this all happened behind my back and just felt dirty. I never explicitly said no to poly, I just wanted him to discuss it with me first and then we could make a call from there. 

So what happened recently is we had Sarah and Kyle over for drinks and games and everyone was feeling fairly drunk. We move to the couch for a movie were i proceed to fall asleep. Unbeknownst to me until the next morning is that Kyle was laying on my and kissing my ear suggestively (which I'm upset about also). and Somehow Sarah and Max end up sitting next to each other and I'm next to them and apparently they start making out and did for a couple of times with Kyle and I there as well. I find this out two days later from Max. After some long talks we agreed that Kyle and Sarah are off limits as more than friends and I don't want him and Sarah hanging out 1-1. But it seems like they wanted for my and Kyle to also hook up in the same way, which i'm not interested in.

Mostly I'm numb and at a loss with what to do. I really don't want anything beyond friendship with Kyle and Sarah anymore also because they don't seem very sexually confident and stable with each other with passing jokes about a lack of a sex life and it being pretty vanilla. I just don't want to light fire on their relationship and my own. But part of me is wondering if this is all a huge waving flag for me with future things with Max. And if I should even consider being friends with Sarah still. She has upset me like this twice in a huge betrayal and I'm tired of it despite being such good friends. Also we haven't heard anything from Sarah and Kyle since that night... 

**TLDR**: My boyfriend and best friend drunkenly made out in front of me while asleep and her boyfriend (awake). Discussions of poly have happened prior to this but I have no idea if I can trust my bf or be friends with my best friend anymore. Help."
82,"My [20M] best friend's [21M] girlfriend [20F] is absolutely vile and he can't see it


Hi all.

My best friend Michael has been dating Lily for the past year. She is quite different to any of us. She is quite well off and well spoken, prim and proper, etc. She goes to uni and is a really smart student, much smarter than either myself or Michael who both work for a living. 

When I first met Lily I thought she was really nice. She was really bubbly and friendly and seemed like she made Michael happy. However, as they got closer I began to notice things. For example, she is constantly making fun of the way Michael dresses. He doesn't dress badly and obviously makes an effort, and yet she is constantly telling him that he should spend more money on his clothes and that how he dresses is ''boring''. Bear in mind that 
Lily does not work and gets as much money as she wants from her parents and so can afford expensive clothing. She also makes these comments about random people who walk past us and frequently mocks their clothing and their physical appearance. She particularly does this to other women including the girls in our group, who don't like her but are civil for Michael's sake. 

She is also a complete snob. For example we went for food a few weeks back, and she was making snobby remarks about ''the kind of people'' that end up working in fast-food places and said they were all ''stupid idiots''. IIRC, Lily is working towards some kind of career in finance, and is constantly going on about how much she'll be earning once she starts working. 

She also smokes a lot of weed. This isn't a problem for me, since both myself and Michael used to smoke it. However, Lily doesn't want her parents finding out, and so asks Michael to hold it for her. This means that not only does he have to deal with potentially dangerous drug dealers, but he also risks being arrested for possessing the stuff. Lily is smart enough to be aware of this but does not seem to care. 

Finally, she is a thousand times worse when she is drunk. She swears at everyone and is constantly aggressive and rude. She starts screaming at people who even look at her funny and has even tried to fight me at one point. She picked a fight with two women on the train just because they responded to her blatantly mocking their accents, and Michael had to hold her back. Yesterday we were all on a night out and she tried to kick a homeless man. I stopped her but she went psycho and tried to attack me. Michael got her off and took her home. I told Michael that I will not see him any more if he brings her along, and that I respect their relationship but will not make any effort to be friends with Lily. 

Michael read my messages but did not reply to them. I feel like I am losing my best friend of many years due to this horrible girl and I don't know what to do to get him back.

TLDR: My best friend is dating a horrible girl who is a snob and I want him to see her for what she truly is.  "
83,"He (40s m) told me (21 f) about sleeping with 2 high school girls, as if he was bragging. I'm super uncomfortable now.


My coworker said something I found very uncomfortable.

I was out to happy hour with a group, it was a happy hour my manager was putting on the company credit card to celebrate a big project we completed. I wasn't very drunk but some of my colleagues were. 

A group was telling some raunchy jokes, and i went out for a smoke. One guy i work with joined me. He brought up kinda out of the blue that he'd had a threesome. (I say kinda Because the group had been joking about them, but he and I hadn't been talking about that one on one)

He said it was with two high school girls, they we're sloppy drunk, he was annoyed how drink they'd gotten themselves because he wasn't that drunk, one was maybe on drugs and decided partway through that she didn't wanna be there so she just rolled over on the bed and laid around kinda out of it. 

I was kinda boggled, why was he saying all that? The story rubbed me the wrong way, it didn't sound really consensual? I asked him how old the girls were. He said 16 or so. I aksed how old he'd been. He said in his late 20s. I was kinda freaked out because that's super illegal here. I didn't say as much, but he seemed to see i was shook, and he volunteered the info that he was in a country that was legal, not like America.

I excused meself and went back in to settle my check and go home.

I'm kinda shook up that...

1. He admitted something that really doesn't sound consencual

2. He said it out of the blue like he was showing off?

3.  THEY WE'RE CHILDREN.

I've heard from other people that HR at my company is no help unless stuff happens at work. And also does the bare minimum for things that do happen in the office.

I don't think the police would care because that happened a long time ago in another country. I'm

My boss might be a good person to go to. He seems like he'd get why I feel sketched out, he has 2 daughters he is very protective of so i think he'd see how weird it is that his employee is bragging about screwing drunk kids

I could tell thus dude to his face to stay the fuck away from me. Then say that again every time he ignores it. I've found that this works on people especially if you do it in front of others and they feel ashamed. It might be weird doing to someone i was expected to work with. But by telling our boss, maybe it would be fine


But I don't wanna work with this dude again. I have a weird feeling about him and I have learned from experience that i ought to trust my gut.

What are my options ?

Tl;Dr my coworker bragged about screwing two very drunk high school girls at once and I'm grossed the fuck out and not cool with working with him again. What are my options?"
84,"I [22 f] saw my boyfriend [23m] cheating and I ghosted him. Do I owe him a breakup text?


I was in a relationship with Sam for two years. We met in college, and I felt a little like we'd been growing apart after we both graduated. I've been super driven in my career and in continuing education after college, Sam's kinda went the morning re comfortable route. But nothing that was a deal breaker yet. Then, last week's Thursday night, I was studying for a job interview and I got hungry but I didn't feel like cooking, so I went out to a my favorite bar that does half-price food after 9 pm to get something cheap to eat, while I looked up interview prep stuff on my phone.

So I was sitting alone there, eating, having a beer, and studying. And I saw my boyfriend across the room with a girl I didn't know. I was about to go say Hi, but something made me feel a little weird. They were kinda close and hanging on to each other. I didn't do anything but keep watching, and he kissed her. I got the hell out of there, I wanted some air. I don't think he saw me at all. 

I walked around the city for a bit, crying, and in that time, I knew I needed to end the relationship. I went to Sam's apartment, not knowing if I'd find him there with the girl, but hoping I wouldn't. I let myself in, and he wasn't there. I picked up everything of mine that was there, packed it in a trash bag, and left, leaving my key behind. 

I went home and blocked Sam on everything. And I put in a maintenance request to my landlord to have my locks changed urgently. I also started locking the deadbolt which uses a different key than the normal lock, a key that Sam doesn't have. I told my 2 best friends what I'd seen, and told them that I didn't want to make up, and that they were free to keep talking to him if they wanted but I didn't want them to try to mediate between us, I wanted it to be over. They said they didn't want to hang with them, knowing what he did anyway. They were all really supportive of me, and said they were blocking him everywhere too.

I called my mom who convinced me to go to bed and get some rest before my job interview, because she knew that it was very important to me, and I'd regret letting a dumb boy ruin it. I went to bed.  The next day, I had the interview, which was the final of 3 rounds of interviews at a really competitive place. I had my phone off all day. I thought it went well, I was able to kinda compartmentalize away all my stress and sadness for the day.

----

So yeah, I know ghosting wasn't the most mature idea, but I had so much going on with my career that I didn't want a distraction from that. I had that big interview, plus 2 other first interviews scheduled for the next week and a half. I didn't feel like I owed Sam the time or effort of an explanation, or an argument about staying together, or what. He fucked up, and I'm sure he knows what he did.

I literally haven't spoken to him in a week and a half, and I've heard from mutual acquaintances that he called the cops on me, saying I was missing, and they were pretty dismissive of him saying that's not what it looked like. 

And that he hadn't heard a thing from me except for a girl friend of mine saying him not to come around.my apartment or else, right before blocking him.

Apparently he's been asking about me to a bunch of mutual friends, who are now asking me if I really didn't tell him I was dumping him. They all think I should of said something. 

So I don't know if I screwed up and should unblock and text him saying ""we're broken up because you cheated"" or something for closure or whatever. I don't feel like he's owed that but I think I'm putting my friends in an awkward situation by not doing so.

I feel like he knows what he did. Even if he doesn't know how he was caught, or whatever, he knows what he did. I don't want to speak to him again.

tldr; I ghosted my boyfriend who cheated. Do I owe him a breakup text?

85,"I [30F] hooked up with a close friend [34M] years ago; his new girlfriend [33F] just found out and secretly reached out to MY boyfriend [30M] to ""talk about it.""


About three years ago I had an acquaintance at the time named Phil. We knew each other through mutual friends and saw each other frequently for a group activity we both did, but we weren't super close friends. One night Phil and I were at a party, got very drunk, and ended up having sex. It was totally unexpected, neither of us had been interested in the other in any way (romantic or sexual), it was honestly just a case of us both being drunk and horny. After hooking up, surprisingly, Phil and I actually became really close friends. We never even so much as kissed after the initial hookup, and it is 100% a platonic friendship now. I'd consider him one of my five best friends. 

About a year after Phil and I hooked up I met my now-boyfriend Sam. Sam and I have been dating for two years. Phil just started officially dating a woman named Jackie last month. Sam knows about the drunken hookup with Phil and couldn't care less; he's hung out with us enough to know that there is zero sexual tension between me and Phil. HOWEVER. This morning, Sam received a Facebook message from Jackie. It was long so I won't repost it, but the gist was that she just found out ""what happened"" between me and Phil back in the day and is ""extremely upset and concerned"". She seemed to think Sam wouldn't know, and asked him to meet for coffee this week ""to discuss"". 

Sam has not replied to Jackie's message. We don't know whether to send it to Phil, ignore it, or just respond and say ""who cares?"" Jackie has met me a few times but has only met Sam once. What is our best course of action here?

**TLDR** A friend I hooked up with one time years ago is dating someone new and she just reached out to my boyfriend to tell him that my friend and I hooked up. I feel weird about her message and am not sure what to do."
86,"My (26F) boyfriend (24M) tried to propose to me on a trip we took for Valentine's Day. I'm not ready to take that step, and said that it wasn't the right time. He's (understandably) hurt and nearly refusing to talk to me. How can I save this relationship?


My boyfriend and I have been together for almost two years. He started bringing up the idea of proposing to me very early on in the relationship, which always felt too rushed to me. It's not that I never want to marry him, it's that I take this step in a relationship very seriously, and don't feel right rushing into it.

We talked about this even just a couple of months ago, and while our relationship has been going wonderfully, I still didn't feel like it was the right time, for a number of reasons related to my life and the progress I have (or haven't, really) made in it. I thought we were on the same page with this.

Not long after that, I got an unrelated idea to go out of state with him for the first time to my favorite city which he's never been to. It's about a 5 hour drive away, and I figured it would be a nice getaway for us, and a memorable and romantic Valentine's Day. The first couple days of the trip were absolutely wonderful. We made some great memories and had a great time together. Then the last full day of the trip I found out he was planning to propose that night. 

I told him I still didn't feel like it was the right time, and that I loved him very much but that we still had stuff we needed to figure out and learn about each other. That I absolutely still wanted to be with him and that I really did want to marry him one day, I just couldn't accept his proposal yet. I couldn't lie to both him and myself and pretend I was ready for this when I truly wasn't. And I do want to marry him one day. It always seemed like something that would definitely happen one day, I just didn't see it being the very near future, and wanted to be absolutely certain before saying yes.

He spent the rest of the trip trying his best to keep things positive, and it didn't really work as well as he wanted it to because I knew he was hurting. But we talked things out on the way home the next night and agreed that we would be okay, and our relationship was going to survive this. We went to dinner before he dropped me off at home that night, and he seemed like his usual, genuinely happy self again. We were making our normal jokes and having a great time, so I honestly thought things were fine.

The next day, he leaves all of our group chats with our friends, quits the D&amp;D group that we were both part of, and makes plans to quit the second job he had just worked so hard to get. He tells me that he's going to be making a lot of changes soon, and refuses to elaborate on what that means. He also has been taking care of my cat recently, due to a complicated issue that I don't want to get into here with my home life. After not really talking to me all day, he messages me out of nowhere telling me he's bringing the cat back tomorrow. 

I've tried so hard to talk to him and tell him that I really do love him and want to make this work. I've told him that I understand that he's hurting, and will give him whatever space that he needs so that we can figure this all out and keep our relationship alive. He's barely responded to any of that, and doesn't seem to be giving me any indication that he intends to work with me to fix this. Is there something I can do that can fix this situation, and do you guys think this relationship can be saved?

**TL;DR**: Boyfriend proposed before I was ready, I said no but that I still want to be with him. It looks like that may not get to happen and I want to know what I can do to try to make sure it does."
87,"I (27F) have been debating leaving my husband (33m) for a while. Filling our taxes from 2018 might have just made it official.


On phone please excuse format. TDLR at bottom. 
So, we have been married almost 4 years. In that time he has changed jobs like most people change their jeans. I file our taxes online every year. This year he had 5 w-2's. That I could find. He says there is more, and is shocked our refund isn't anywhere near what it usually is. I have a 5 year old from my previous relationship. We didn't even make enough to quantify for the child tax credit. I had 1 job at the beginning of the year, but between college and having a still born baby. I didn't go back to work until December. He lies all the time about his job and how much he makes. It's so frustrating. It's sad when I am more shocked that he stayed at a job long enough to get 2 paychecks than I am when he tells me he doesn't have one. 

 The other thing is our sex life is crap. It's vertually non existanant, and when we do have sex it really isn't worth the 7 minutes. (Most of that is forplay) He keeps saying he will go to the Dr and get help with that problem, but ALWAYS finds a way to cancel the apt. I honestly feel like there is no connection at all anymore. Aside from my daughter being really attached to him, and the comfort part. I don't know why I am still with him. Im not perfect, by no means, but I can't keep living like this. Idk how to break it off, or where my daughter and I would go until I could come up with the money for an apt. I know I no longer have feelings of love for him. I care about him, but that's about as far as it goes. Idk if I'm trying to vent or ask advice on the best way to end this relationship and not cause a huge drama show. I have to think about my daughter, and how this will change her life too.
TD;LR: Husband can't keep a job for longer than a couple of weeks. He is in his 30's and still acts like he's in his teens. I'm no longer in love with him. I haven't been for some time now. Trying to find the easiest way to leave that won't cause too much drama/stress for my daughter or him. Idk what to do at this point."
88,"My [28F] boyfriend [26M] has a weird and kind of embarrassing hobby


 

We've been together for 3 years and moved in together 8 months ago. We have a ton in common, we barely ever fight and we have all the same goals for the future. He's my best friend and I can't imagine a better relationship. 

&amp;#x200B;

Of course, there's a but coming: he has a super weird hobby that I just can't get past and I worry it's going to become a dealbreaker. Basically, he's a porn collector. He's not addicted to porn and he doesn't spend a ton of time watching it - maybe a couple times a week, and we often do so together. It's like he's a vinyl collector, but for porn. 

&amp;#x200B;

He spends at least an hour a day searching eBay for deals on what he refers to as ""collector's items"" and half of our living room is taken up with his giant shelf of DVDs and signed posters. Every year he goes to a couple of conferences for other collectors and something called the AVN awards? Right now he's in the next room posting on a forum about this rare film that was apparently the first legally filmed fisting scene in Europe. I'm not kidding.

I get that people have lots of weird hobbies, and he's not hurting anyone with this. Our sex life is great and it doesn't seem to be impacting our relationship. It's just that I can't mention his hobby in conversations with my coworkers, and inviting my parents over requires 48 hours notice so I can hide everything in the closet. I don't know what we'd do if we had kids. Is this normal? Am I totally minimizing a giant red flag? I want to marry this guy but I need reassurance that this isn't completely bonkers. Help?

tl;dr My boyfriend is a porn collector. Should I be worried?"
89,"I (14F) am having trouble telling a dude to back off (17M) that I've known for about 5 months


This is my first post really so w h o o p. So me, a newly started out freshman in like the 2nd semster now keeps being bothered by someone I made friends with in the first semester, and now I have a class with him since I have a 4 block schedule and our classes switched. At first he was being nice and friendly ect, and he recently asked me out to the park so I was like whatever, and beforehand I thought he was 16 (that still doesnt make it any better but oops) I asked if I could invite a friend because I was scared shitless abt going alone, and he said sure. 

My friend came, but ended up having to leave early,and as soon she left he started to get weird and started being handsy I guess? (I'm still basically a fetus and at this point I've never really been touched or thought of this way openly I guess) I felt really uncomfortable because he kept touching me, like my arm my neck and waist ect, and nothing like this has happened to me before  finally I said stop, and he did but he kept playing with my hair

He also admittidly said he was actually 17 and that he didnt care that I was so young and wanted to do more things with me and I tried to lay him off but he kept insisting. After I just made up an excuse to leave early and had my cousin pick me up.

After i went home I texted him saying that it made me extremely uncomfortable and I didnt really want to do anything like that  again, he just texted me back saying I liked it but I didnt, and then he just said hed see me monday. He keeps flirting and being suggestive to me still and I keep trying to tell him to stop but he doesnt get it and I'm kind of just stuck rn.

I know a obvious answer is to go to my school counsolor, but my school isnt that great and I'm scared it isnt that well, serious? I told my dad obviously also but he brushed it off and just kept telling me to tell him to back off. I also cant switch my class since in my school they dont let us except in the beginning of the semester, so I cant just ghost him because I'm gonna see him everyday.

Like what do I do at this point?I keep telling him that it makes me uncomfortable that he keeps touching me and that he keeps flirting with me, but he just doesnt get it.My friends keep telling me to say I'm dating someone, but I feel like he'd find it suspicious since I never said so untill after like 5 months.



TL;DR- I'm a freshman(14F) dealing with being constantly bothered and harrassed by a junior(17M) that I've known for about 5 months now and he keeps getting progressively worse and I dont know what to do."

91,"My Wife of over Ten Years has Cheated on Me


My wife (33F) of over ten years recently cheated on me. I (35M) found out by going through her phone in September 2018. She got a phone upgrade, and her old phone was sitting inside the dresser, on silent but still going off. I thought it might something important so I picked it up, and saw that she was on Facebook messenger.

She was texting a man who had been our mechanic (34M) for the last year, since we moved into a new house. I never go through her phone, but this time I did. and I saw that she had been talking to him since at least June 2018. I was distraught. I don't know how I made it through work that day.

I confronted her about it, and she didn't deny it. They had only had protected sex twice, if she was telling the truth (based on the texts, she was). 

They had a talk after I found out, and she's not going to see him anymore (and he's fired as our mechanic), but we are in a unique position because he was also a person who provided us with animals (like chickens) for our new property, and hay (we are storing some hay for him in our shed). He hasn't given us any more animals since then, and left some rabbit cages on the side of our driveway.

I will admit that I am sometimes a little lazy and won't do chores around the house, but some of that is also depression since we have had four kids together (and lost two of them, but that's a story for another time). I've been talking to my therapist about it too, and he thinks that confronting her about it was a good idea. Getting up to do chores more often is also a good idea.

She hasn't talked to him since December sixth. She never locks her phone (she never did anyway) but she knows that I go through it some times, though I haven't in a while.

How does one build trust back after being cheated on? We've decided we're going to work on it.

TLDR: Wife cheats on sort of lazy, depressed man with mechanic, but has also broken it off and says she won't talk to him again. Lazy man is inclined to believe her."
