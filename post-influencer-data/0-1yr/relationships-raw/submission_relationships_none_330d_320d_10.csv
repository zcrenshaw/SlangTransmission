0,"Should I be concerned that my boyfriend hid his relationship status on Facebook suddenly when it was public before?


We are both 27/F and 27/M. How concerned would you be if your partner changed their relationship status to private on Facebook? 

I initially had to coax him to change his status on Facebook to be dating me. Then a month ago, after dating for a year, he changed it back to private to where outsiders can not see his relationship status. 

He took a year to make it official with me. He had spoke poorly of me to his ex in the past and stated how much he wanted to be with her if only she was different and better and if they were older. He told his ex I was inferior to her, etc. 

He also refused to delete his exes family off Facebook and hides his posts on Facebook from them. 

But I went on a vacation with his family this year!!! 

**TLDR: boyfriend recently changed his relationship status to private on Facebook and I’m concerned and dunno how worried I should be about this**"
1,"(36/f) Colleague/close friend giving me a cold shoulder, help!


So I have this colleague and we are quite close, not romantically, just very friendly and we have dinner and drinks together all the time with other people or just the two of us.

So last week Friday we went out for drinks with other colleagues, then the other people naturally used the opportunity to burn off some steam from work. I enjoyed the night and then we called the night.

A day went by and my colleague and I planned on a trip/hike on Sunday originally. But on Saturday night she started texting me about how she didn't enjoy the night on Friday when everyone were burning their steam toward her as if it was her fault for everything (they were just facing her when they spoke, not actually accusing her in anyway). So I just responded to her to keep her mind open and think about whether she wants to distance herself from the group or not, give it some time and patience.

Then she replied that she doesn't want to go on the hike and wished me a good weekend. Then I said ""sure, let me know"", and to that she responded ""I am letting you know now"". I actually meant to let me know when she wants to go for the trip again, but anyway... I sensed her emotions were heightened so I just let her be.

Monday comes and she doesn't look at me when we were taking coffee break, or even speak to me. She just started speaking with the other people in the group. That's when I noticed she was avoiding me. Normally she would just strike up a conversation and ask how I am doing etc. But none of that came and it was obviously a cold shoulder.

What exactly did I do wrong? What is she expecting? What is the problem?

TL;DR colleague complained to me, cancelled trip and giving me a cold shoulder. What is happening?"
2,"My (23f) boyfriend (25m) doesn’t have sex with me anymore and I can’t understand why or what I can do any longer.


We’ve been together for five years. The sex issue has been almost 3 years. 


.
.


We’ve been living together for four years and are very loving and emotionally connected. We say I love you all the time, give pecks, hugs, cuddles. We spend all of our free time together.

.
.

I think maybe a lot of the issues have to do with his confidence. We only have sex maybe once a month. I am fit and get hit on often so I believe I am attractive. I give him compliments all the time and call him handsome and tell him how wonderful he is.  

.
.


I have asked him loads of times what I can do to please him or get him more in the mood. I’ve followed through too. Even on things that I wasn’t sure about, kinks and such, but it seems to not be enough to make him come back for more. 


.
.


When we do have sex it’s pretty good. But lately I’ve been finding that I’m not able to focus and I’m just so stuck on trying to be perfect and sexy and make sure he enjoys it enough to want me again sooner than a month from then. 


.
.


He is paying the bills as I am unemployed and looking for work. I know that does stress him out. But again, it’s been going on for three years. 

.
.


I try to talk to him and he does talk about his feelings and work and our future. I’ve communicated the extent to which the lack of was affects me. My confidence has been shot because of this issue. I would be lying if I said I didn’t start fantasizing about other people and what it would be like to have a sexually compatible relationship. 


.
.


I worry I am maybe too picky. But at the same time, I feel like i deserve sex too. He’s told me it has nothing to do with my looks, and that he does her anxiety about sex sometimes. Something that kills me is that I notice when we do actually have sex it’s usually following a few drinks on his end. Sure maybe it helps his confidence but oh my god it feels bad to only want to be fucked when your bf is drunk.

.
.


Also relatively often, he will grope my body and lightly play with me but it almost feels like not sexual to him but it is to me? Hard to explain. But hell do that for a min and sometimes I’ll even see he has a boner but then his mind will trail off and he’ll talk about something else or just stop what he’s doing or fall asleep.

.
.


Side note— he doesn’t jerk off as far as I’m concerned. I have asked and I believe him. He’s told me he just hasn’t had a desire to really have sex. That he’s usually just too tired. 


.
.


Another side— he has ADD. Don’t know if related. He’s unmedicated. 


.
.


Due to that^^ I’ve wondered if it’s a medical issue. I’ve repeatedly suggested to him to see a doctor and even put my foot down about it. He hasn’t scheduled the appointment even though he said he would. 


.
.


Please. Any help or opinions would be amazing.




TLDR: boyfriend only has sex with me once a month when he is drinking. We have a loving relationship but I am at my wits end. It’s been three years of a near sexless relationship where he’ll make empty promises things will change but they just don’t. "
3,"Me [29F] with my boyfriend [28M] of 2.5 years, how do I communicate my needs?


Hello /relationships, 

&amp;#x200B;

I do not really have someone to talk about this, so I am turning to you. This is my first post here, please bear with me. 

Sorry in advance if this is too rambly, I also hope the formatting is alright.

The subject (BF) of this question also reddits, so I have minor details changed/redacted and the obvious throwaway account. 

&amp;#x200B;

My boyfriend Dale and I have been together for roundabout two and a half years now. We have had a rocky start, and the usual ups and downs, but I don't think the backstory matters too much. Will edit if you have any further questions.

We both have mental health issues. In the beginning of our relationship, I have asked him multiple times if he was certain about pursuing a relationship with me - I have several, and clinical, issues, and told him everything beforehand. Also, I really, really suck at everything about interpersonal communication and ""reading between the lines"". I have warned him that this would not be easy, since I am fully aware that my issues can make a relationship harder than it is supposed to be, and I was medicated and undergoing therapy for some years at that point. But he insisted and reassured me he was aware and ready to tackle all issues until judgment day and beyond. We also live together now.

&amp;#x200B;

But here we are, some time later. Currently, he is driving me up the walls. There is pretty much nothing left of that reassurement from the beginning. I haven't been able to work for the last year due to the depression, and am now slowly crawling back into reality and will start a ""work rehab"" program later this year that requires me to be away from home during the week. I am not yet back to a fully functional state, but I have been getting a whole lot better during the course of my last therapy. Thing is, he flat out denies that. In his opinion, I have only been getting worse and worse. He completely ignores the signs of recovery - me being more active, having my issues in a better grip and stopping to isolate myself completely, and also plain feeling much better. Dale has tried to make me argue and question my current therapist (which is the the best I've had yet) multiple times, claiming that he was treating me wrong. He also tried to talk me into keeping to taking meds for my depression, and try new ones, even though I have told him they did not work (some not anymore) and made me feel even worse, and that I had tried so many different ones, I was sick of always having the side effects and none of the benefits. He also talked to my best friend, who lives in a different country, complaning that I would only stare at the ceiling depressedly and read books about my issues all days, so I'd only bury myself deeper in them. He asked my best friend not to tell me he talked to her, but came clean about one day before she told me herself. She was really worried, since he sounded like I'd really do absolutely nothing all day -  he totally forgot to mention I do the household completely alone take care of our pets, run almost all errands (his also, if I can) and cook, all while trying to dig myself out of the depression. 

He has now argued with me two days in a row until I cried. I told him every time I need to stop now, I don't want to keep arguing. He told me it is not for me to decide alone when to stop, and continued. By which he decided alone, and I told him that - it did not matter to him. 

My BF told me yesterday that he can not differentiate between my ""everyday feeling bad"" and me feeling ""extra bad"", i.e. when something happens that brings me further down, because I'm supposedly in the same deeply depressed state all the time (which is not true if you ask me). I am currently very tense, since I have kind of panic because of all the new people and tasks at the ""work rehab"", and had some (for me) bad news yesterday. I told him how I felt, that I just need some reassurement and comfort. He answered me, since he cannot understand how I can be affected by these bad news, since there's basically nothing I can do about it, he can not comfort me, and implied I wanted him to lie to me. 

Dale tells me he is on his last legs, he has to work a job that he apparently hates, yet tells me almost everyday how he is supposedly the best at it. He spends his entire free time playing a certain video game, which he also often complains about, and tells me ever so often he would really like to get back into his originally learned trade, but does nothing that would help him get back. He's too tired from work, and too depressed. I have managed to get him to see a therapist, too. Some of his mental health issues have gotten better, most did not. I have asked him multiple times to seek more intense treatment if he is feeling so bad - i.e. at least outpatient, but he refuses. I get up at a really early hour for him to fix him lunch and see him out, and he often gets mad if I want to go to sleep again (I need more than he does, especially during depressive episodes), even if it is just for a few hours, because he does not have the opportunity. He also frequently asks me why I'm looking at him in a mean way, even though I really don't, or am not aware of it. 

&amp;#x200B;

I guess my whole point is, I am feeling like I am fighting alone here. I try to help him to the best of my ability, even though I have my own battles to fight, but I have the feeling that he just can't see any of it. I always listen and try to be there for him and support him, but it never is enough. He is very vocal that he would want more frequency bedroom-wise, and that this would help him, but my depression has pretty much taken any interest in that away. He already asked my to ask my therapist if they know if there's a ""switch"" for that or how I can bring my libido back, but obviously, you can't force that. Often, when we bring an argument up again, he accuses me of ""twisting his words to match my agenda"" and ""turning everything he said against him"". My problem is, I seeem to have different memories of the arguments than him. My memory is not top notch best during a depressive episode, but usually I'm known for never forgetting anything. I'm really worried that my mental health issues are getting so bad that they affect my memory. 

&amp;#x200B;

I really wish I knew how to tell him that he does not need to understand my issues to comfort me, and that I need that sometimes. Just to hear my feelings are valid would be a great help sometimes. Also, any tips on how to support him better would be greatly appreciated, so he can advance and feel better job-wise.

&amp;#x200B;

Thanks already to everyone who has read until this point and thanks in advance for your help. It really means a lot to me.

I only will be able to answer questions/reply tomorrow. 

&amp;#x200B;

 \*\*tl;dr\*\*: I do not know how to tell my bf what I need and that I am really trying my best to help him. "
4,"My (27F) boyfriend (24M) of 6 years doesn't have sex with me anymore because I don't always squirt


We've been together now for 6 years. I feel like we used to have a pretty healthy sexual relationship but now our sex life has recently come to a halt. Idk what to do at this point. I dress up for him, do my makeup real nice but he barely acknowledges it. I have tried multiple different outfits too. I've gone down on him over and over and over and tells me how awesome it was and then falls asleep after. He doesn't really go down on me anymore and it's not like it's a competition or anything but come on.....ya know? I get on top of him and really give it my all and he lays there moaning but he doesnt even touch me. It's been making me feel super insecure lately like something is wrong with me. I shower before and after so it's not a hygiene thing. I spoke to him about it and he said he doesn't have sex with me anymore because he can't get me to squirt. I've squirted multiple times before but I just don't do it every time which I thought that was normal. I tried explaining that just because I don't squirt every time that doesn't mean that I don't enjoy sex. I also explained that it has a lot to do with my mind and the energy in the room. I pointed out that when I initiate sex I like to light candles and incense and massage him for a while and just be gentle and slow about it and that I like those same things done to me as well. I don't need it every single time but being romanced every once in a while would be nice and I told him that. He was pretty quiet during the conversation. We ended up having sex that night and I didn't squirt. This was about 2-3 months ago and we haven't had sex since and I've stopped going down on him all the time. Hell, we barely even kiss at this point. It's like our intimacy is just.......disappearing. I thought maybe he's getting bored with me but I really do try to keep things interesting for him. Idk what to do anymore. Just looking for some advice or encouraging words. Thanks. 

TL;DR: My bf of 6 years says he doesn't have sex with me anymore because I don't squirt every time. We've talked about it but nothing has changed. Need advice. "
5,"My [26] boyfriend [28] just told me that hes going to bring a tent to his coworker Halloween get together in case he gets too drunk to drive home.


A little back ground: my ex use to drink a lot and would get in a lot of trouble and cause a lot of drama. My dad and brother are also alcoholics and I haven't drank at all in about 3 years. Needless to say, I have a rocky relationship with alcohol.

Ok, so my thing here is, I don't like that hes bringing a tent to sleep in, if he gets to drunk. I asked him if he could just not get so drunk that he cant drive. He said its just what everyone is going to be doing and hes ""not getting peer pressured but he want to have fun with everyone."" But that sure sounds like peer pressure to me, right? Am I being too sensitive about it? I cant really put into words why I don't like it, it just seems wrong.  It also seems kinda childish... What do you think? What would you do?

tl;dr my bf said he might camp out if he gets too drunk. I told him just don't get that drunk. he said he didn't want to miss out of the fun. "
6,"I [23F] have a workplace crush [27M] and I am feeling lost at sea.


tl;dr I'm having a middle-school-style crush on a coworker and I don't know how to cope! 

Throwaway for reasons that may be obvious. 

I got out of a 3.5-year-long serious relationship last Christmas. It was pretty painful. I finally feel like I'm inching towards dating again... maybe. At least, I thought I might try something really casual to ease back in until I got hired for some part-time work and found myself insanely crushing on my coworker. 

See, I haven't had a real crush since 5th grade. When I was getting to know my now-ex-boyfriend, I don't think I was ever in much of a crush stage with him. I wasn't incessantly reminded of him going about my day by the little things, or thinking about his smile, or giggling like a moron at his jokes. 

And now here I am daydreaming about how adorable my coworker is when he's there or not there, fantasizing about him, and even writing my crush-y feelings out in a diary. It's out of character and intense and I am just very surprised by all of it. 

When I'm actually interacting with him, I feel like I can't just ""be myself"" around him. I end up either acting *too* coldly professional to try to stifle my attraction, or when the mask slips, being obvious and overly familiar. I have no idea if he realizes all of this because we have only known each other for around 2.5 months now. Our work together is good and he says he regards my professional skills highly, but I have no idea how he sees me as a person. 

I don't want to just get it over with and ask him out for several reasons: 

* Workplace romance is categorically a bad idea, right? / professionalism
* I'm honestly a huge chicken and never have put myself out there like that
* I already feel like my work takes up a huge amount of my life and dating someone who's also deep in the same work might make it truly inescapable
* We both coach students together and the last thing I want is to make it weird for the students that their co-coaches have tension. Our season goes from late August to the end of April / sometimes June - making it agonizing for months if I fuck this up now
* I was hired specifically to take some duties off of his overloaded plate - he doesn't seem to have time to date
* I don't have evidence to believe he likes me any more than as a colleague although we have a good cooperative working relationship 

Really, my questions are: how do you deal with inexplicably intense attraction to a coworker? What did you do if you were in a similar situation? Is it possible to hide it until it goes away (especially from perceptive students)? At most extreme, can you forcibly get rid of a crush? "
7,"I [18m] am in an open relationship with my [18f] girlfriend but (see text)


Gives dude blowjob. - told me about that beforehand like we agreed. 
Same night: ends up crossed with a guy back in her room and he was a bit too rough on her. She apparently couldn’t muster the words to say don’t go rough. I tried to help her reach out to Title XI services due to the large bruises on her butt.

Says she is going studying, studies then hooks up with guy at 3:00. Stays the night. Lies about it in the morning.

Temporary breakup - I got over it because I thought she needed to mature more. We were closed relationship.

Established true rule list in google docs. Along with, I need to figure out the open relationship because I sometimes got overprotective/jealous because it sucks not spending the night sometimes.

Met girl on tinder, she came over to my place - we hooked up.

Sickness started 

She goes to hang out and smoke with a guy alone, back at 3:30. *Got free weed*

She asks me if she can hookup with someone, I said I’m not comfortable with tonight even though I want you to have fun. (Have been incredibly sick for the last day.) Dude from tinder she met like a month ago came over to hang out with her and another one of my friends - seemed ok because he apparently was basically not able to function from how crossed he was - but now I’m suspicious due to her staying the night tonight.

At same guys place for 2+ hours (fell asleep there?) because “he needs to borrow gel pens for his geo-lab.” (Last night)

Sickness ended (hopefully, a 102 fever sucks).

I don’t know. I feel lost

TLDR: Hooked up with at least two people without me knowing during our relationship. I got sick and she’s hanging with dudes alone, got free weed from hanging out with a guy at 1 o’clock in the morning, and also I believe has stayed the night at another guys place tonight."
8,"I [19M] have been hooking up and have a complicated relationship with a a woman much older [36F]. I caught feelings for her and I need some advice


I have been seeing her for about a year now (I met her when I was 18). She is really attractive, she has money, and she has a daughter who is still pretty young but she isn’t with anybody. So, basically she spoils me with things I like and money; in return. we get to have sex and I go out with her to places and am basically like her partner but not really. 

She’s taken me on trips and vacations and I sleep over with her at her place most days of the week. Things got complicated because now I have strong feelings towards her. I like what we have and I don’t want to risk losing that either. It’s like I partially have what I want with her but not really. I know that this probably wouldn’t even work out anyways and people would say “you’re too young for her anyways” but I really do like her a lot. Do I keep my mouth shut about it? Talk with her about it? Just put my feelings aside?

TL:DR I fell for a woman who is much older than me despite the age gap"
9,"I [25M] have decided to break up with my girlfriend [25F] but I have some concerns


Basically we are part of the same group of close friends, therefore after we break up, it will not be the last time that I see her. We have been friends since the 6th grade along with the friends in our group, started hooking up irregularly in 2014-2015ish, before we officially started dating a year and half ago. Worth noting that we are both each other's first official relationship. 

I have several reasons for wanting to break up and it feels like a lot to type out. Skip the next 3 paragraphs if you don't want to read the reasons/rant (please someone read this I have no one to open up to).   
The short but not so short version is that the relationship as of late causes me more stress than it does happiness. We've had ups and downs before and have worked them out and gotten through them and become better from them. But lately we are always having the same ""arguments."" Sometimes they are not even arguments and just her spewing blocks of passive aggressive/sarcastic and condescending texts at me about things that are either overreactions or unfair generalizations. I sometimes don't reply for several minutes because I literally have no words. I often feel uncomfortable bringing up even the simplest of things. What I want is for her to just listen to what I have to say so that we can both first understand the problem together and then talk about how to resolve it. Instead she jumps to conclusions or makes incorrect assumptions and makes it difficult to speak to her. Sometimes I legitimately don't quite understand what exactly is her reason for being upset either. When I want to talk about it to try and understand she just gets all petty and says that it's useless to talk about it. I'm not perfect either, and she has some legitimate points where she has the right to be upset at me. Instead of just telling me what it is that bothers her though, she has to be mean, catty, and sometimes vindictive.   
Then usually, once I know and understand what it is that gets under her skin exactly, I put it into consideration for all my actions. I constantly feel stressed about saying or doing the wrong thing because I somehow always end up triggering her. I have seen her argue with her siblings sometimes as well and quite frankly, for a lot of them I have to side with her siblings. Her siblings have also sided with me on certain points when they stumble across us arguing. I spend A LOT of time at her house (particularly weekends). We both work full time, and if we both are home and free (we live 3 min drive apart) it is expected that I come over and spend my time with her. The best word I can think of at the moment that would describe her behavior with me is jealousy. If I don't have a good enough reason for just wanting to stay home and chill for a bit before I come over, it becomes a whole thing. Once I show up at her house, I STAY there for the whole weekend literally. It almost feels sometimes like I need permission to spend time away from her. If I want to hang out with previously mentioned group of friends, I'm accused of not wanting to spend any time with her. She makes comments like ""Well don't get mad at me if I want to go spend time with my friends!"" I've made it clear to her that she can choose to do whatever she wants with her free time... She's free to spend all the time she wants with her friends provided she doesn't flake on me if we have plans. If we have nothing planned, whatever she wants to do with her spare time is fair game. Obviously remaining faithful is a condition, however I have complete trust in her regarding this. I'm sure when she says she will get drinks with her classmates after class, that some of them are guys- I have no problem with that. I don't want to be the person that tells his girlfriend who she can and can't talk to. I have actually found myself encouraging her to hang out with her friends and classmates just to be able to grab even just an hour to myself.  
I used to play the drums almost daily but ever since I started dating my gf I can count on one hand the number of times I sat behind the kit. I started my career two years ago just a few months before we started dating, so my life is basically divided into 3 parts: Work, Exams for career development (hundreds of hours for multiple exams), and my gf. Sometimes when we hang out, and my mother texts/calls me, for whatever effing reason this triggers my gf. She thinks my mom is constantly asking me to do stuff and that it is annoying and she thinks my mom should respect our ""hangout time."" I should mention that both of us live with our mothers still. Recall also the short drive back to my house. In reality, my mom is as annoying as any other mom, including my gf's mother! If I do my mom a favor, my gf literally gets mad and says I'm a mama's boy and that my mom is lonely and needs to go find a boyfriend.... I live at home rent free while I am progressing successfully through my career. I am taking advantage of this moment in my life to absolutely destroy my student loan debt before moving out. This while I arguably still have my youth (my back is killing me!) I also assist my mom routinely with bills and the mortgage. I swear to God, that in any given week, I see more of her mother than I do my own, and I live with mine. The lady gave birth to me and irons my work shirts for me. My mom can call and text me all she wants. I still ignore her at times like any other person does to a nagging mother- my point is my gf's interpretation of all this is ass backwards. She helps her mom out a lot too with groceries, bills and whatnot but it's different for her because ""she's a girl."" Both of us had single mothers growing up- I'm sorry that my only parent wasn't the same gender as me? I also am making much more than she is and she sacrificed a lot to raise me and my two siblings so of course there's no question that I am going to give my mother financial help if she needs it, especially while I live there?? This is one example I had to bring up because I still don't understand it. Is this normal? Am I using the word ""jealousy"" correctly here? Seriously tell me because I don't know anymore. Even her siblings acknowledge that all I'm doing is being a good son and that my gf is reading too much into it, but she doesn't budge. The crazy thing is that this doesn't really even affect her?? These are arguments spawned purely from her own opinions/interpretations of pre existing things and she gets upset if your opinion is not the same as hers.  


&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Rant over but holy crap did I have a lot to say. I still have more but maybe another time.  
If you guys feel some examples/context is still necessary I'll come back and edit my post or just DM.

&amp;#x200B;

So how do I go about breaking up with her? Preferably I'd like to remain friends with her as we are part of the same close clique and do not want to make things awkward for ourselves or our mutual friends. One of which is her NONidentical twin sister... I consider her a great friend of mine even before I started dating my gf and I wouldn't want that friendship to be strained either. We will all likely still be in the same group chat and invited to all the same shin digs as usual and run into each other at our only local bar and all that.

  
Unfortunately, I see her not taking my reasons for wanting to break up too well. We are currently in one of the lows- it will not surprise me if she is fine with breaking up but I'm sure she will still want to argue why my reasons are invalid. Eventually, my friends are going to want some juicy details however I also don't want to paint her in a bad light. At the end of the day, I want happiness for her. However I am done sacrificing my own for hers.   
We are seeing each other Friday I believe- I'm not sure if I should tell her as soon as we meet up? I was thinking spending some time together Friday just to make sure when I end it we can be on good terms. I don't want to end it while we're in our 'low.'

&amp;#x200B;

TL:DR  
I want to breakup, but we're part of the same group of friends. I'll still see her all the time. How do I go about this delicately? "
10,"I [23M] really like my new coworker [20F] but don't know what to do


tl;dr
I know people always say don't shit where you eat. However, I am mature enough to handle rejection or a situation that would go south. I wouldn't do anything differently on work level. With that being said, I really like this girl. She seems very sweet and is just beautiful.
 
I chatted with her a little about school and work. During this convo, I said that I saw her somewhere. She laughed and said she remembers me from another office where I was interviewed (she later quit that place and we ended up now working together in a different office) (small world).

I really want to know how I can push it to the next level without being needy or creepy. "
11,"Was I [F25] wrong to ask for proof before going on another date with him [M28]?


Hello! Basically just looking for opinions on how this went down and if I should have behaved differently. Here’s the facts:

This man and I met online. We talked for a week or so online and I was getting really into it, but then it looked like he unmatched me. We rematched a day or so later and I asked him if he had unmatched me and he told me that he didn’t, he thought I had. I figured it was a glitch and sent a bug report to the developers. We continued talking for another week or so and then he asked for my number. I gave it to him and we started talking there.

Within a day or so of exchanging numbers I asked him on a date. I picked the restaurant, day, and time and he agreed to it and seemed super excited. There was a few days between planning the date and the day of the date. Day of the date comes. We had been texting all day and earlier that day he said he messed up his schedule and appointment of his was gonna run longer than he had expected so he asked to meet about a half hour later than initially planned. That was fine with me as I didn’t have to rush over after I got off work. I get off work, change, and head to the restaurant. 

I arrive about 15 before the new agreed upon time and sent him a text to let him know and asking him to let me know when he gets there. I see that he read it but no reply which is understandable as he’s driving. The agreed upon time comes and goes and I have no response from him. I shoot him a text just saying if he needs the address resent I can do that or if he needs directions I can call. No reply. Another 10 minutes pass, he isn’t there. So I try to call. The phone instantly stops ringing and I get punted to voicemail. So I leave him a voicemail just asking him to call and let me know if he’s coming or not. Another fifteen minutes pass and I shoot him another text basically going “So...are you coming or not?”. No response. I try to call again with the same results. I take a look at the text string and it shows the texts as not even delivered. They never even got to his phone. I know that’s a thing that happens when you block another iPhone. Same with the instant kick to voicemail. So I go back to the app we met on to message him there, but even though I had just seen our message thread there the day before it was no longer anywhere in my inbox. That happens when you unmatch someone. 

So after about an hour total of waiting and then seeing all of the above I realize I’ve been stood up and blocked. I call my best friend and she meets me at the same restaurant we have a great meal and complain about how dating sucks. I’m really hurt by what happened as it was my first time ever being stood up, but I know I’ll move on.

Anyway fast forwarding to the present, it’s been a little over a month ish since the failed date. I’m swiping on the app and who do I see? The guy who stood me up. I also pay for premium so I can see that he has liked me. I decided that if he swiped right on me he did so intentionally and I want to ask him wtf he thinks he’s doing blocking me and unmatching me and then swiping right on me again.

I match with him and send him a message essentially asking that. I understand that that may not have been super productive but hey. Oh well. He responds back super quick saying he got into a car wreck. Oh why did you block me then? My phone got destroyed because he got hit by a semi and his car was ruined beyond any repair. Oh how hurt were you? I wasn’t! Only some scratches. Well why did you never call or text me after you replaced your phone? I didn’t have a recent backup with your contact in it.  Do you have any pictures of the wreck? Nope I deleted them all after I sent them to my insurance, but he was SO excited to match with me again and give our date another go!

Everything had an answer, and who the hell deletes pictures of a wreck where they got hit by a semi, it RUINED their car, and they got out uninjured? Also that sounds kind of unlikely too. So basically I asked if he had some sort of proof that what happened happened because some of his answers just sound sort of unlikely and he got MAD. He was asking me why do I think he would lie about this and do I want his insurance information since I’m going to be so unreasonable? I told him I’m not trying to be a b*tch about this but I have had dudes pull some sketchy stuff before and I’m just trying to be cautious.

He never responded. His reaction though has me wondering if I was out of line asking for proof. Was I? What would you have done?

TL;DR: guy appears to stand me up and block me, weeks go by, he matches with me on the same app we met on, I ask him a bunch of questions about what happened but some things just seemed unlikely, I ask for proof, he gets pissed,was I wrong?"
12,"Ex gf messaged me


I [19F] just received a text from my ex girlfriend [20F] and don’t know what to make of it. Short Backstory: we met when I was 16 and had a thing, had a relationship, broke up had a thing again (we were trying to fix things right here and had an unofficial exclusive sort of relationship) and then (we were 18/19 at this point) she started talking to a coworker while we were “not official” i got mad and she told me sorry and that she was ready to be in a relationship. Of course i was upset and said no because she broke my trust to be able to do this while we were focusing on fixing us and to give me some time to rationalize everything. This upset her because she thought I meant i didnt want to talk to her anymore which led to us falling apart with a lot of feelings for each other still + no closure. Flash forward she ended up in a relationship with said coworker and they’ve been together a year now and she messaged me yesterday asking to be friends because she missed our friendship. I admit i do too it was by far one of the best friendships i’ve had, nothing compares to the feeling i felt when talking to her, we shared so many things in common and i want her back in my life. However thinking about the way the casually messaged me after everything that happened frustrates me because i feel like i deserve an apology but a part of me also wants to move past all of the kid / first love drama. 

Tl;dr My first love is trying to come back into my life casually after ending on bad terms. Part of me wants to casually talk another wants an apology. What do i do? 

What do you guys think? Are my feelings for an apology valid? Should i just casually move forward and try to be friends (which i 100% know i can do because i have genuinely moved on from a romantic relationship with her) ? Thank you guys. "
13,"When to call it a day?


I've been having doubts about my relationship for quite some time now. A while ago I felt like this was down to his behaviour. He drinks a lot, can't hold down a job and wasn't very helpful with our baby. However, he has been much more helpful recently, work seems more consistent and although he's still drinking, he has really cut down. He seems to be taking things a bit more seriously now.

The problem is, I just can't shake the doubts I have. We've been together for 6 years and I can't remember the last time I felt truly happy with him. Over the years, we have both said some horrible things to each other and although I believe he loves me, I really don't feel like he respects me. I'm not even sure if he knows how to... I find myself constantly thinking about what my life would be like without him and thinking ""it will get better after ☓ so I'll just wait until then."" 

I'm at the stage now where I've been with him so long, waiting for him to change I fee like I resent him too much and its affected my feelings. I don't even know if I love him anymore. But I'm also conscious now that this doesn't just affect me anymore, it affects our baby.

Thoughts? Has anyone been in a similar situation?

14,"Do I [21/f] make a decision that will please my heart or please my mom [49]?


I love and respect my mom on all levels but a lot of the decisions that I do and have made are based on wanting to make my parents happy. I still love in their house which I don’t mind because I enjoy their company but I definitely don’t like that I’m pushing 22 and am still threatened with punishments. 

My boyfriend [25] and I have been going through two months of strenuous relationship struggles and the only one I have to talk to are my parents. It was definitely my mistake to tell my mom so much, and a learning lesson not to divulge relationship problems to her because she now hates him. She was there to pick up the pieces when I was stricken with heartbreak. 

My boyfriend and I decided to patch things up and we’ve scheduled a date for tomorrow night. My mother is furious and told me that I can’t go and that if I defy her that I will be in trouble. 

If I do decide to go she will be extremely upset and my actions will come off as disrespectful but at the same time, I would like to make a decision that isn’t based off of making someone else feel at ease. I want to make my own decision.

Tl;dr: Should I go and anger my mom or not go to ease her frustration?"

Hey all! I've been stressed about this situation and just felt the need to share with a supportive community...if anyone has suggestions as well, I'm all ears!

My older brother (B) has an intellectual disability, and has had a girlfriend (G) for 8 years. She also has an intellectual disability. Eight years ago they were in a skills-building program to learn to live on their own, but both ended up leaving because they needed more support at home. While they were at the program, they would sleep over almost daily over throughout a period of about a year. Throughout this year, G's father hated B. Whenever he visited, he would kick B out of the apartment and ignore him.

Once G and B left the program and lived 800 miles from each other, they began to FaceTime daily. For the past eight years they've video chatted nearly every day. They call each other ""wife"" and ""husband."" At one point five years ago, G was allowed to come visit B.

B and G haven't seen each other for 5 years, and over the past year I began to speak with G's father to try and help him see how cruel it was to keep them both apart. Our first call was during a period where both B and G were suicidal (also occurred when G's father took her cell phone so she couldn't speak with B).

Over the past year I've tried to convince the father to let them see each other, but he has refused. This past summer my family traveled to a reunion, 40 minutes from where G lived. I pleaded with the father to let them see one another, but he refused...after this, G said to her father: ""I'm going to wait until you die to marry B!""

At this point G had exerted her independence. Her father threatened her by saying he would not transport her to medical appointments (coercion), so I decided to call G's psychologist/treatment team.

As I talked to the treatment team, and they talked to G, she began to express a desire to move down and live with B. G's treatment team has been far more open to them visiting, and over the past month we've planned an initial visit.B and G are so excited about the visit, they call and text me every day about it.

I'm so proud of G for exerting her independence!! I'm also anxious about the visit...I got a letter in the mail threatening to have myself and my brother arrested if we step foot on G's property (owned by father), or her father's house.

It's been a long road to get here, but I'm excited (although nervous) to re-unite my brother with his girlfriend! I just felt I needed to share this and figured I might post it here, as it has been a stressful process.

**TL;DR** My brother and his girlfriend have intellectual disabilities and have been restricted from seeing one another by the girlfriend's father. Although they're disabled, they still have rights, and I've been trying to help them be able to visit and/or eventually get married to live together"
19,"I [26f] sent explicit messages to an ex and my husband found out


Hi,

So I know I’ll get some hate and I understand that. But I’m genuinely looking for any advice that could help. 

When I was feeling low a former ex got in touch with me and this led to some mild flirting which quickly escalated. It culminated with sending some sexual pictures. The only explanation I can give is that my medication has been changed so I’ve been emotionally all over the place. Not an excuse and I recognise now that I am completely in the wrong. I deleted most of the chats as I knew it was wrong but didn’t stop. 

My husband found out as I have asked him to help manage my time through this as it makes things easier for me and while writing a plan he noticed the message left over. He asked what it was and I panicked and kept telling him part truths until I just broke down and admitted it all. 

He’s obviously incredibly upset and to be honest I hadn’t realised how much distance I was putting between us and I was taking all the little things he does for me for granted. 
Seeing him break down like this was heartbreaking and It all hit me what I’ve done. 
Even upon finding this out, he didn’t shout or anything like that, he just calmly asked why and to explain. He’s said that he needs to think but suggested that while I give him that time I look for advice and things myself. 

I know I’ve made a huge error but I want to turn it around, basically Reddit if you were in his position and decided to give me a chance what would you want from me/what kind of things can help rebuild trust and bring back intimacy and make him feel sexually desirable. I’m willing to do whatever it takes but I’m also aware it may be too late. 

I know this is long but please help

22,"My [25M] best friend [24F] is obsessively creepy with guys and when it doesn't work out, uses me as an emotional dump. What's the best way to confront her about this?


My best friend is constantly calling me complaint about her ""relationships"" and any form of criticism on her is met with extreme defensiveness. At first I thought she just kept dating really crappy dudes, but as time went on I started to realize she was putting out really extreme expectations on them without forming a genuine relationship at first.

For example, she met a dude at a festival and they casually hooked up 4 or 5 times over the next 6 or 7 months. He wouldn't respond to her messages at all unless an up coming festival they were both attending was soon. She constantly would tell me how she was going to ask him to be her bf, even though he lived six hours away from her and was very clearly, at least from my perspective, not interested in anything besides a festival hookup. She would casually mention her five year plan with him and even considered moving to live with him six hours away, even though the guy gave no indication whatsoever that he was interested in a long term thing. During this time period she would call me once or twice a week to vent about how he hasn't texted her back in 2 weeks and analyzing every single message he ever sent her. Every time I tried to mention that she didn't really know him that well or it felt like he wasn't really interested in her resulted in her freaking out at me. When that ended, after she asked him to be her bf, she was basically comatose for the next two weeks.

The most recent example was her ex from 5 years ago came back into her life. They talked for a month and hooked up. After they hooked up, he ghosted her completely. Shes been constantly calling me crying about the situation, in complete denial that he's ghosting her and making up implausible situations about why he hasn't been responding to her calls and texts. It's been about a month since she's talked to him and she's still absolutely devastated over it, saying things like how can she get over it when it's the truest love she's ever felt and other things like that.

My gf was recently hospitalized and I've been really stressed and upset over it. I told my best friend and she instantly compared our situations saying every things going wrong and started talking about how her ex still hasn't called her back. She didn't even ask how my gf was and just started bawling, talking about how upset she was. At this point, I snapped and said you're getting ghosted, he was back in your life for literally 3 weeks, get over it. We haven't spoken since.

I'm worried about my best friend, but I can't keep being her emotional dump for her unrealistic and honestly creepy expectations for her ""relationships"". Any attempts by me to talk about this with her are met with her saying things like this is just how I am or it's not my fault I love so strongly etc. What can I do to help her learn how to casually date or try to build up a real relationship?

**TL;DR best friend becomes infatuated with guys too fast and complains constantly when things don't work out to her unrealistic expectations. I can't take it anymore and don't know how to approach her about this.**"

Husband and I have to live here while he’s in school for a few years. We are savings and don’t pay anything (long story). 

Moved country it’s hard. Harder than I thought. Like hard to the point where I wonder if I’ve made the right decision....  because there are so many things I just have to “deal with” for 3 years that feel tough. 

Had an opportunity to go back to my country of birth for a little or stay here. Couldn’t choose and was a mess over making a decision. Miss my life there or leave my partner(while he’s doing study and work full time in this time anyway) they in laws are great. They take me places, and feed us. But it’s all broken our own independence and my say almost because we can’t afford otherwise. 

Anyway two comments actually three that have really rubbed me the wrong way and I don’t know how to go about it. 

1st one me: feel like if I go I won’t even want to come back. 
Her: “well you need to decide whether you want a life with *her sons name*
Ok that ones half fair whatever obviously they’re gonna watch out for his heart over mine... right 

2nd one to me:  “you need to be a big girl and make a decision because you chose to marry”

3rd one to husband: “atleast you will be happy in *my country of birth* without your family” 

These were comments my in law made to me and my husband and I can’t help but feel awkward really damn awkward and angry so so so angry.   

Plus my BIL is so lazy around the house and makes me not want to make an effort for a relationship with him. 

How do I avoid my anger and get passed the laziness. I had to bite my tongue. It’s not helpful in our situation. Felt like saying I probably won’t last cya later have your son back...

I tell her I find her attractive and she tells me she’s ugly. I now find myself looking at her and seeing her through her own eyes because of all the things she’s mentioned about herself. It’s like I am thinking her thoughts about her because they’ve been drilled into my head. 

I’m starting to distance myself from her and beginning to look at other women. I love her but I feel like her insecurities are convincing me that she is as weak, ugly and unworthy as she believes. I feel like an asshole and I don’t want to be a bad boyfriend, I just need some insight.

28,"I feel like a useless waste of space and want to help my husband more. Help?


Okay, bear with me this is a long one.
 so my husband and I both work full time jobs and I also work a part time job. He works 4 ten hour shifts Tuesday to Friday 730 am to 6 pm and I own my own business and work a part time job as a manager at another business 6 days a week total from *roughly* 9 till *roughly* 6. Sometimes I can work as early as 7 and work as late as midnight. Sometimes days like this in a row and it gets hard. He works at a desk answering phone calls in a high stress job but low physical work. I am a hairstylist at both jobs and am on my feet the vast majority of the day. So it's physically very hard on me. Plus I'm overweight and deal with SEVERE cripplimg anxiety on a daily basis. I am doing the best I can to manage all of my internal and external crap as to not burden my husband with it because he does SO MUCH for me the last thing I think he needs is another issue to stress him out. He is sweet, kind, attentive, selfless and wonderful. I'm blessed beyond words to have him in my life at all. Let alone be married to him. Some short back ground my husband has been in and out of work during our relationship and has been the victim of my selfishness and manipulation at one point*to which I am daily making up for and trying to better our lives* and during that time I really milked the fact that he will do everything for me and not bat an eye. He will cook, clean, do dishes and the laundry, take care of the yard and when he was working he would pay all the bills. I let that continue out of neglect for his thoughts/feelings and out of selfishness and I know I suck for it. I've done a lot of shitty things to an incredible person and I'll never forgive myself for any of it but I'm trying to do what I can to improve our quality of life and his overall happiness so I need to be more helpful so that I may help reduce his stress. No matter how dishonest, selfish or manipulative I may have been I have always been faithful and have never stopped loving him even if I chose loving myself and my thoughts  and wants more than I chose to care for him and his. This is something I'm working on. So on top of my physically exhausting job, my extreme overweight body, my crippling anxiety, massive depression, mood swings, stress from trying to build my business/pay bills/keep a chipper and positive appearance/promote/working two jobs and I have no heel in my right foot so standing all day and coming home and busting my tail on the house is hard on me physically but I feel like a bum and I don't want him to feel like I don't want to help him. He is a very clean person. I mean I'm clean, like I don't want to live in filth and I pick up after myself but he is very very tidy. I want to help more around the house. He doesn't like the way I fold clothes or wash dishes. I have recently discovered I like cooking so there's something I can do. But I want to do more without just irratating him and him feeling like he has to redo what I've done and I want to avoid wearing myself out completely after long days. Any suggestions?

I feel useless at home even though I bust my butt at work and I want to help my husband without annoying him or killing me. Help?"
29,"My friend's girlfriend made a rude comment towards my girlfriend; I confronted him and now he's angry at me. All our mutual friends are taking his side, and asking me to ""move on"". [Everyone is 22-25 M/F]


I'm going to make this as easy to understand as possible.

**Backstory:** Evan \[25M\] and I \[25M\] met in high school and have been friends for 8 years now. We are part of a larger group of 6 guys \[all 25M\], who are my best friends. I have been with my girlfriend, Laura, \[24F\] for 4 years now, so she's pretty much integrated into this group too.

**The rude comment:** All of us met up for dinner one night. I brought my girlfriend and Evan brought his new girlfriend, Rachel, \[22?F\] of 2 months. This was the second time we were meeting her. Everything was as per normal until we were leaving for club in 2 separate Ubers. Someone suggested that the 2 couples (me, Laura, Evan and Rachel) shared 1 Uber, and the rest would share the other. Rachel immediately declined and said ""I think Evan and I will take the other Uber. You guys can go ahead with \[me, OP\] and Laura."" I was weirded out but whatever. So 2 other guys in the group said they'd come with us. Next I heard Rachel say to one of the guys coming with us, we'll call him Alex, very sarcastically ""Have fun in that Uber"". I knew something was up at this point but I didn't want to cause a scene then.

**The clarification of the comment:** Few days later I couldn't stop thinking about it so I texted Alex to explain what Rachel's comment meant. Apparently Rachel felt that my girlfriend was ""very different"" and ""high class"",  because Laura grew up with money and her privilege did show sometimes. But Laura has never been arrogant or rude with them. Of the 4 years she's joined my group, no one has felt this. Plus even so, I didn't think that would warrant such a comment from Rachel, who we had only met twice up to that point.

**The confrontation:** So I texted Evan to express how I thought that comment was really rude, and it really made both myself and Laura upset. That Laura is especially hurt by it because she now feels like she's not welcomed to the group. I've known this guy for 8 years... We've been through so much. I thought he'd apologise and agree that Rachel was indeed rude about it. Instead he called to yell at me about it, claiming that I was attacking his girlfriend, who ""obviously"" didn't mean anything by the comment. That it was purely a joke and if I or Laura could not take it then that's our problem. I was taken aback. 

I spoke to Alex, and another guy who was present, about what happened and they both urged me to ""forget about it"" and ""move on"". They said it was just ""a misunderstanding"", and if Rachel said she doesn't mean anything rude by it, then she doesn't.

**What I feel:** I'm just so disappointed by how my friends have reacted to this. No one apologised to either me or Laura. They're just expecting us to act as if nothing has happened. If my girlfriend had been the one to make a rude remark about Evan's girlfriend, I'd be calling Evan and Rachel up to apologise profusely. I just don't get it. Am I overreacting? Is my 8 year friendship with them just over like that?

**Tl;dr Long time friend's new girlfriend made a rude remark about my girlfriend. I confronted him that I felt the remark was very disrespectful and he blasted me instead, telling me to take a joke. Our mutual friends are asking me to ""move on"".**"

31,"Is there a double standard in my relationship or am I just reading into this way too much?


Sorry in advance, this is a somewhat messily written/formatted post. 
[TLDR is at the end]

For background, my boyfriend and I have been together for 3 months, so it’s not a particularly long time. We are in our late twenties. We haven’t said “I love you” to each other at this stage (although on my end I know I do love him). 

When we met we immediately divulged our seperate plans for next year: he’s going overseas for quite a few months and my new job will take me away from home for roughly the same amount of time. Despite those obstacles, he asked me to be his girlfriend. At this stage we’ve agreed we’ll discuss the future when the time comes. He’s even jokingly said we’re going to avoid talking about this for as long as possible. I’m not sure when that will be exactly but I imagine we’ll want to sit down to discuss this in a month or so’s time. I’m okay with that for now, although not knowing if he intends to have a LDR with me or not is making me a bit anxious.

——————————————————————————

The main issue I want to bring up in this post is that while I’m an emotional person, he isn’t really emotional at all. The exception is when he gets frustrated with something he has occasionally slammed his fist on the table/dashboard or thrown down the object causing the problem. It makes me a bit uncomfortable, but I just say nothing and wait for him to cool off which is usually seconds or minutes later. 

Just to be super clear, he has *never* behaved like that towards me and we haven’t even had an argument yet.

I’m generally a happy person, I love being around him and am very affectionate towards him. Currently though, I’m in a bit of a limbo in my life, waiting for this job to begin, a few other personal family issues and past experiences with ex-friends that have affected the way I think and feel. I have rarely divulged any of this to him as to not add stress to his life. 

However when I have felt moments of being overwhelmed with stress, it has turned into me struggling to stop myself from tearing up. I’ve only ever been uncontrollably teary once in front of him and once over the phone when something rough was going down in my family. In that moment when in person he cuddled me, but when I tried explaining why I was feeling blue he kind of laughed and said he still didn’t understand. I also felt criticised when he then said it was frustrating to him that I was blue. He wasn’t outright nasty to me about it, but it was enough to make me feel bad and scared he’ll leave me if I get like that one too many times.

Fast forward to this week, he unfortunately experienced a death in the family a couple of days ago. I’ve told him I’m there for him and if he needs anything to not hesitate to ask, but he’s made it very clear he does not want to discuss it *at all*. I’ve respected that request and we have completely avoided speaking about it. But something he said to me yesterday bothered me. 

I asked if he wanted company that night (I asked this because I privately wondered if maybe during this difficult time he might be finding it hard to ask for comfort) and he said “Not tonight, I mean, you were at mine all last weekend and you’re going to be there again all this weekend.” This has made me really concerned that I’ve now become an imposition or a burden to him. 

He said I can come over tonight and asked me properly today. I responded with “If you’d like me to sure.” We sort of have had an exchange where he thought it was odd I said that and all the while I felt my mood was down. Not on-the-verge-of-crying down, but obviously flat. 
I am *really* bad at hiding my feelings from my face, but I am actively trying to change that (with some difficulty).
We said bye, I could tell he could see I was flat, I had already told him I had trouble sleeping the night before (which is true), and then he parted ways. I messaged him an hour later to double check what time I’m coming over tonight, I’ll probably hear from him in the next couple of hours. 

Now here come the questions: 

Why can he get visibly miffed when I seem sad or flat, but I feel like I have to be okay with him throwing things and slamming fists when he gets frustrated by something? Is this a double standard?

Am I over analysing this and this business of him saying I’ve been over at his often lately? 
Btw before this, I have never invited myself over against his wishes or turned up unannounced, *ever*.
But I do acknowledge that he could just be in a weird headspace right now considering what’s just happened in his family. 

I’m just very worried about him and how he must be feeling secretly, but I absolutely respect that he doesn’t want to talk about it and respect his need for space. In turn I’m also worried that I’m inadvertently causing him to feel smothered or something by my presence.

I just want to feel free to share my feelings and trust him to be patient and understanding  (as one should be able to in a relationship) without the fear of him possibly criticising me for being emotional or leaving me because I am emotional. 

At the moment I feel very guilty for even worrying about any of this.

——————————————————————————

TLDR: *My boyfriend gets a bit annoyed when I’m sad, but I don’t say anything to him when he slam his fists in frustration (this behaviour is never directed at me btw). 
I’m worried I’m becoming a burden to him because I’m an emotional person and he isn’t.*"

Okay so this might be confusing but ill try write it as best I can. My boyfriend (m22) have been together for nearly a year and all is good. The other day i made a youtube video and asked him if he could share it to his friends and like it. So the vid is like completely a joke and meme video (LIKE IM LITEALLY JUS FUKING AROUND) *STILL WANT THOSE LIKES THO.* Anyway I asked him to share the vid and he just kept saying ""noooo"" and like saying he doesnt want to share it and all this shit. I was like ""what the fuck...okay"" So i asked some of my other friends to share my vid and they all just said ""sure dude funny vid"" and stuff like that. My boyfriend finally ended up sharing my vid to 2 of his friends and then proceeded to call me annoying and say that I always piss him off and stuff. Now I know this is so immature n shit but like he never wants me to go out with his friends and stuff and like i've met his friends before a few times and they all seem fine with me. And the other day we made this fucked up cringe tik tok video (like the musically app) COMPLETELY AS A JOKE) and i sent it to my 2 best friends and he went off at me, and asking if i have self respect???? like why does he get so fucken angry over me sending my best friends (whom ive been bff's with for like 10 years) a video of us just like messing around.  And HOW HARD IS IT TO SHARE MY YOUTUBE VIDEDO!!! His reasoning for not sharing it was because he doesnt share stuff....yet like 2 weeks before he sent me his friend's vid to like and comment on! idk if this is making sense Im just so confused. Now he wont reply to me, idk sorry guys my spelling is shit n stuff i jus feel rly fucked off and confused.

&amp;#x200B;

Tldr; dumbass bf wont share my vids, is he ashamed of me "
37,"Me (21) boyfriend (25) had sex while I was extremely drunk. Not sure i wanted it


Made a throw away for this but please dont upvote. 

Last night i was very drunk to the point i was puking and could barely walk up the stairs by myself which i know is my own fault.  What happened next is a big blur. Apparently i initiated sex but i definitely dont remember doing that. I dont know how long it went on for but i remember saying please, he asked if he was hurting me and i said yes. I went to the toilet and realised i was bleeding. 
There was a big argument and i wanted him out the house, he said that because earlier in the night i had promised him sex (i said this sober) and that he knows i get more confident after iv had a drink that he thought it was alright. 
I asked him to leave and that id pay for his taxi home because he was too drunk to drive. He didnt want to leave his car here so he refused to get a taxi and said that he is going to drive home but if he loses his licence it will be on my head.
Of course i couldnt let him drive intoxicated so i told him to sleep on the sofa and leave in the morning. 

TL;DR Im not sure if i wanted what happened, So here i am, im confused and hurt, he says he will be back in a few hours but i dont think i want him here. What do i do?"
38,"I (20F) have a co-worker (33M) showing interest. How do I nip this in the bud ASAP while still being polite?


Hey all.

I have a co-worker who is showing interest in me (calling me pretty, buying me food, flirting, etc), which would be fine and all since he is possibly the hottest man I've ever seen and is super sweet and kind.. But he's 33. Yikes. I'd honestly shoot my shot if he was 10 years younger and we didn't work together, but that's not the case and I want to keep our relationship professional. 

Of course, my friends think it's hilarious and come into my workplace openly making jokes about us, which doesn't help the situation. It also makes me concerned that he'd be going after me in the first place because he definitely knows how old I am. 

I know it's partially my fault since I'm being way too nice about it. I've always been thinking of others feelings first, but I know I can't do that in a situation like this. 
I want to be polite since we work together 1-1 for 7/8 hours of the day (which also may have to do with it? Maybe he's just bored??) and I don't want it to be awkward. It's not at the point where I would need to bring in my supervisor, but I still want to be courteous to his feelings, if that makes sense. Is there any way I can tell him I'm not interested without being an asshole?"
39,"Me[33 M] met [29 F] for an arranged marriage and I am confused.


I am an Indian and going the arranged marriage route to settle down. A small backstory, I had an earlier proposal, but ended badly couple of weeks before the wedding, the girl &amp; family lied to us. The girl was rather suspicious &amp; asked the same question a 100 ways. She wanted to plan the 10 yrs after marriage and beyond before the marriage. She was just crazy with a crazy family &amp; possessive brother. In the end, put the blame on my family &amp; spread vicious rumors about me. That left me rather anxious, suspicious &amp; disgusted on how people view marriage as a business deal and are not honest. Family &amp; friends, to comfort me, decided to tell all the bad marriage stories and how as per Indian legal system, a groom is assumed guilt until proven innocent and proving innocence is tough. Basically, be glad you didn't have it that bad. But now, I feel a groom is more suicidal than a suicide bomber. 

This is another proposal, since 2 months. The girl's family is good &amp; the girl also seems much better than the previous one. I actually like the girl and she is also rather fond of me &amp; very excited about the marriage. I am just faking a smile as I scream inside. I even told her what I was going through and she is very supportive. Just requested that I don't suspect her after the marriage as it will hurt her since she actually loves me. I felt like shit and feel very bad that the beginning part her marriage is this bad. But I am also overly suspicious about everything (even her being so sweet to me) and most of my queries I have been able to addressed. But there is one that just bugs me &amp; I am not sure how to address it. Plus, I could not find anything I can open up and ask this question. I feel this rather personal and has to remain between us. But I still need answers, so here I am.

The girl keeps telling me that ""as along as YOU are with me, everything will be fine"". My overly suspicious part is just lost trying to figure out the double meaning. How is she sure that I am a reliable guy, we just know each other for 2 months? I am wondering why does she not say ""as along as WE are together, everything will be fine"". Is she just preparing to blame me for everything that goes wrong by saying ""YOU"" instead of ""WE"". I have not had past relationship or a sister. This is my first time being so close to a female and I am not sure if this is normal. The only relationship I have to compare to was the last one and it was a shit show and anything is better than that one.

tldr: 33M with no relationship experience is clueless about the female race &amp; I am freaking out. Not sure of the line between normal &amp; crazy."

41,"My [26F] friends [20sF] don't seem to understand that my overseas work assignment isn't a paid vacation.


I work for a company that has offices all over the globe. This spring, I've been selected to do a three-month assignment in a particularly posh city (think Rome, Athens, Paris), and I'm incredibly excited. While the city itself is awesome, it's a major stepping stone in my career, and most people who do these assignments get good promotions afterwards. In addition, work is paying for my flights, accommodation, and of course, the work I do when I'm there. 

My boyfriend \[28M\] and I are particularly excited. We have been discussing getting engaged soon, and since he works remotely, he's planning on coming with me. My work has okay'd this, including him living with me, and the company housing also has an extra room.

My friends are all very excited for me, too -- and can't wait to ""come visit me while I'm overseas"", although I haven't invited them to. I of course wouldn't mind seeing a friend for a weekend, but this is only a 12 week assignment, and I already have 6 friends announcing their plans to come visit me for a week. I wouldn't mind seeing a friend for a couple weekends or a week, but I'm not interested in playing Exotic City Tourguide to someone for half of the time I'm overseas -- you know, where I'm WORKING. The project is supposed to be for me to get acclimated to the kind of work we do in that country. Being there is in and of itself work. I told them this, and mentioned I will likely be working late most evenings, and they just raved about how dinner there is popularly served late anyway (?) so they can sight-see all day and meet me in the evenings.

A few suggested they stay with me. I quickly told them all that I wouldn't be able to host them, as the housing is company-provided, and they said they'd get a hotel and just see me on evenings and weekends.

I love my friends, but I am not interested in seeing ALL of them, separately, for half the weekends and evenings I am in this country, especially if it's when Boyfriend and I are living together (and I hope, maybe, preparing for a proposal.) But I can't exactly stop them from booking flights and being in the same city as me.

As I write this, I feel like my tone has more vitriol than I intended. I think it's because I was really excited for this to be two things, and two things only: a big opportunity for work, and a special time in a romantic setting with the man I expect to propose to me soon. I don't really want to share it with my friends who I see all the time in my ""regular"" life. Do I need a new perspective?  


TL;DR: Got a posh, medium-term work project in a cool city overseas. It's only 12 weeks, but all of my friends are trying to make concrete plans to visit me -- totaling to about half the time I'm there. I don't really want to share this time with them, and prefer to focus on work and my partner. Am I out of line?"
42,"My boyfriend (26M) is a serial cheater and I (20f) don't know what to do about it anymore


I've caught him at least a dozen times. We had a deep conversation about this three days ago!!!! And last night I caught him, again! He says he loves me and that he's trying but he keeps going behind my back and talking to other people. I love him and want things to work out but it really hurts. I don't know why he can't tell me the truth. Im trying the best I can to help because he says he knows what he's doing is wrong but he doesn't know why he does it or how to stop. I'm just a confused sad mess. We have been together for 2 1/2 years and this has been a problem since the beginning. I'm lost. 

Tldr; boyfriend has a cheating problem and I don't know what to do anymore"
43,"What to do with moody coworker?


I (31F) am really close friend with a coworker (43M). Or was I guess. We would chat daily and joke about stuff at work. But once in a while he would get into a “mood” and doesn’t talk to me at all, just completely cold, and even mean when I try to talk to him. All of this is over IM since we work in different offices, so it’s hard to resolve in person. 

When this happened in the past, I tried to make conversations until he talked to me again and things are back to normal. This time, it’s been about 2-3 weeks, and every time I asked, the answer was “too busy,” which I know is BS. When he’s busy, he just complains, but would never be cold or mean. This also happened right after he came to my office to visit and we met in person for the first time and went out to dinner with two other coworkers. I thought everyone was having fun. Then all of sudden, the next day when he came back to his office: ice cold. 

He stonewalled when I asked what happened, then started being kind of mean too. I’m so confused about what is going on. I’m ready to give up on this whole friendship, it’s just hard cuz he’s really nice and has helped me a lot with work (I’m newer in the company, almost 11 months in now). If this were a friend outside of work, I would have chewed him out and let him know that friends really shouldn’t treat friends this way. But since this is a coworker, it’s much tougher to handle. Ugh! 

Can you guys shed some light on what is happening? What should I do? I guess I should just leave it alone and let it go, but it’s killing me to understand what the heck happened! How do I let it go and just move on with my day? Work gets lonely when you don’t have a friend to talk to or joke with!

TL; DR: moody coworker/ friend acts cold/ mean once in a while, what can I do?"
44,"Colleague won’t communicate. [non-romantic]


We have been working together for a few years and I used to think we were on the level of actual friends; hanging out on weekends with spouses, going out for drinks after work, etc. I know making friends at work is always tricky and probably a bad idea but it’s hard to network outside of work when you live in a big city and spend hours a day just in your commute. 

To make it clear why this is a problem professionally, this person and I share a percentage of the company work. There are other individual responsibilities that we also each have. It’s not a great system but pretty much the shared work is done on a first come first serve; whoever gets to it first does it. Unfortunately, this individual is faster at data entry and tends to get to a lot of the shared work before I do. This puts them at an advantage of always having done more of the shared work and always being the one in the know about most daily events. Which is why it is very important that we communicate. 

Anyway, a few months ago another colleague quit (who they were also “friends” with) and ever since the current colleague has pretty much stopped all communication outside of direct questions and even then I get short one or two word answers. I’ve gone as far as pulling them aside and asking if there is something that I have done to upset them or if there was something wrong, and said that I felt they had not been speaking as openly as they once had before. They assured me that nothing was wrong and I sort of left it at that, but communication did not improve. I tried ignoring the problem and just being super friendly. I tried to convince myself that it was their problem and not mine. Maybe something was going on at home. Tried to tell myself that I shouldn’t be worried about what other people think of me, etc. However, it is frustrating to the point where it is hurting my daily job. 

For example I will send them a Slack message regarding work and they won’t respond. I will have to go and check manually that the request was fulfilled. I will have emails that are completely ignored. I will be standing right beside them talking openly asking a general question to the office staff and they will (I feel) actively ignore me, as though I am not even there. One time they left the office early and was going out of town on a business trip and did not mention it, just left without saying a word. 
I have tried to speak to my supervisor about it, but was told to speak to the coworker. Which clearly I had already tried to do. I’m to the point of being very frustrated with my daily work and it is so confusing as to why this person has stopped communicating. I do not want to try speaking to the supervisor again, or HR, and I do not think pulling them aside again and asking if anything is bothering them or if I have done something to offend them will help. I’m at a loss of what to do. A few weeks ago I started looking for a new job at a new company, which I don’t really want to do because I like the other employees and the compensation is good. 

Anyone have any suggestions? Has anyone else dealt with this sort of behavior? "
45,"I [19M] could really use some advice on how to get over this breakup. [19F]


It's been two months since my ex girlfriend called me to tell me we should break up. We both go to different colleges and I understand. I don't blame her, and I'm not mad.

But I just constantly keep thinking about her and all the fun awesome stuff we did. Like running through the rain in Chicago, playing music, camping in the woods, learning to firebreath, working at a summer camp. Just so much fun happy memories. And then I think about how she's gone and I can't talk to her anymore. It just sucks. I miss her, and I don't know what to do about it.

Every time I get high I just want to text her and ask how she's doing, I want to let her know I miss her and I want to know if she feels the same. I never have, but it's hard to fight the urge to sometimes.

I know this isn't as big of a problem as some people post on this sub, I know it's simple, but if anyone has any advice I would sincerely appreciate it. I don't want to be sad about this anymore. It's like, what do you do when you're with someone you think is incredible and you have all these amazing memories and then one day it's just gone?

Tl;dr I'm not over a breakup and I don't know how to get there. If you have any sage advice on how to deal with this I would very much appreciate it. Have a wonderful day"
46,"My [27F] boyfriend [32M] calls me a c*nt in front of people and I want him to stop


I love my boyfriend dearly. We’ve been together for a few years and more often than not everything is fine. However when we disagree on something (anything really) he starts practically shouting and telling me how dumb I am for my view on whatever it is we’re disagreeing about. Many times he’s called me a c*nt and it is both hurtful and embarrassing. I’ve expressed to him more than once that I don’t like when he speaks to me that way, and he needs to stop. We’ve had very heated arguments about it. Things will be fine for a while but then it happens again. When I bring it up he tells me I’m being too sensitive and can’t take a joke. It never feels like a joke and is never funny to me. I have called him an asshole plenty of times but it doesn’t feel like it’s the same thing. I don’t like when he calls me names and I just wish he’d listen to me and not do it. Again I do love him, but I don’t know if that’s something I can continue to just live with. 

TL:DR my boyfriend calls me names. and I want him to stop. "
47,"How can I [21M] have more fulfilling conversations with my Grandmother [76F], and cheer her up a bit more?


he is basically chair-ridden and has been a few years now. Cannot leave the house and hasn't for about five years, doesn't sleep in her bed, and instead literally just sits in a (very nice) recliner chair. Because this has been the case for about five years now, she has put a lot of weight on &amp; has awful circulation issues with her legs preventing her from walking or standing far. Sadly, we've tried to get her help, told her she needs to be more proactive, but she just doesn't want to help herself really. She is completely reliant on my step-granddad (who's 55, so much younger) and has become very ""whiney"" over the last year or so. Sucks big time.

To my issue though - I feel like when I visit her now she's just so glum. I struggle to make her laugh, I struggle to find conversation starters because she isn't in touch with the world and not doing anything apart from watching TV all day. I can reminisce about things with her, but that is just about it. Has anyone got any tips or things I can do to try and idk, improve her mood a bit and better our conversations?

Thanks

TL;DR - Grandmother is stuck seeing the same 4 walls 24/7, barely moves, has become a bit pessimistic about life and I find I struggle what to talk to her about."

51,"I (29M) am interested in a woman (27F) and not sure if I should pursue it or if I'm making her feel awkward?


We are both RNs that work in different departments, except right now we are both working together on new admission protocols for the hospital for the next two weeks.  To keep it brief her and I talked before this quite a bit but never outside work.    


I've decided to start pursing this recently. So I told her I thought she was great and I like talking with her then asked for her phone number and if she wanted to grab a coffee with me after our shift.  She gave me her number but told me she couldn't do coffee because she had plans with a friend after work, but immediately invited me out to a party with her and her friends this Friday instead.  Unfortunately I'm working a night shift that night and I told her I would try to find coverage and let her know if I can make it. So far no luck in finding anyone wanting to work my Friday night shift so I was thinking of telling her I can't go but reschedule for another day. 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm not sure if she sees me as a friend or if she has some interest. I notice whenever she sees me unexpectedly she looks at me then quickly looks away and will approach me later or I'll talk to her first.  She's not an awkward person but is a little awkward around me but that is probably because I'm awkward. Sometimes it feels like she avoids me, and I'm afraid it is because I'm making her feel awkward but then she will sit down next to me and talk my ear off.  She helps me out whenever she can at work and I return the favor to her.  She also laughs at all my dumb jokes.  I work ER and she came down to grab supplies for her unit when we had a trauma come in, a young guy fell off a cliff and had some decent lacerations (he was fine, walked home with only stitches) and she asked me was the guy high on something  hiking at midnight with no flashlight?  I said ""Yeah he was real high, then he went real low real fast and I think that was the problem here tonight.""  My coworkers groaned and she was the only one to laugh.

&amp;#x200B;

Then again sometimes she seems disinterested in me and I fear I may be looking too closely into the other things.  She's a friendly person so maybe that is all I'm noticing. 

&amp;#x200B;

I guess my question is should I continue to pursue this?  And how should I go about rescheduling a date with her?  Should I be more forward in asking her or keep it more casual?  I don't want her to feel awkward or pressured into hanging out with me.  How do you ask someone on a date with out making them feel pressured?  

&amp;#x200B;

I feel like a teenager writing this.

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR;

I like a girl at work that works in a different department. Asked her out and we had plans but I can't make it so I'm trying to reschedule.  How should I go about that, should I go about that?  How to not make her feel pressured into going on a date with me?  Also the winning lotto numbers if you have them.

52,"I (23F) think I am ready to cut ties with my extremely toxic mother (58F), but I’m not sure if I should/how to go about it.


This will be lengthy because there’s a really complicated history here, but I’ll try to condense the details as much as possible. I’m also on my phone, so sorry if this formats weird.

My mom accidentally got pregnant with me by a deadbeat alcoholic she barely knew when she was 35. She was on drugs/dealing but straightened up to have me, and I am her only child. I believe she has severe undiagnosed mental disorders and has needed intensive therapy her whole life that she has not received.

Basically my whole childhood we lived with my maternal grandparents who pretty much raised me. My mom never really got along with them because she blamed them for some abuse by another family member that she experienced as a child, but they always helped her out whenever she needed it despite their crappy relationship.

My mom was always the “cool mom” when I was little who let me do stuff I shouldn’t, so we actually had what I thought was a pretty good relationship when I was growing up. However upon looking back as an adult, I see now that the real reason we got along so well was because she acted more like my older sister instead of my parent, and in reality, she was a pretty shitty mother in general. She has always had a horrible temper and used to take all her anger out on me verbally (I can remember her cursing me out multiple times when I was in elementary and middle school), and she set a horrific example of how to be responsible financially, as she blew any money that ended up in her hands (including my child support) in record time. She was and is a pathological liar and is racist and sexist to boot. I’m pretty “normal” compared to what I could have ended up being, but I attribute that mostly to my grandparents. I definitely have suffered emotionally due to this upbringing, and I have been in therapy myself in the past to deal with underlying issues.

When I was sixteen, my grandmother was diagnosed with cancer. My mom was devastated and they repaired their relationship. My mother actually made me drop out of high school and get my GED so I could take my grandmother to chemo and radiation. My grandmother died two years later, and my mom developed alcoholism worse than anything I ever witnessed from my deadbeat father.

She forced my grandfather and I to move to an area with a cheaper price of living and couldn’t work because my grandfather had such bad dementia that he required round the clock care. I was trying to pay all of our household bills on my $7.25/hour retail job pay, and my mother’s temper had only become worse with the drinking, so she would start in on me anytime I was nearby while she was drunk. Our “good relationship” completely went away, and I was extremely lonely and depressed, often suicidal. I told her I was having thoughts of harming myself, and she pretty much ignored it.

At this point I met the man who would be my future husband, and we started dating. I can’t even express to you how much he did for me during that time of my life. I started spending barely any time at home and began separating myself financially from my family to gain some independence. My mom actually claimed to like him, but then any time she would drink and we were alone she would cry to me about how resentful she was of him because he was taking her baby away. Translation: he was taking her source of income (me) away. She kicked me out of the house twice during this time, one of which we got into a physical altercation because she was so wasted she tried to hit my husband and I just lost it on her and he had to separate us.

After we got married in 2015, I moved out, and the hostility between my mother and I died down some. She constantly asked us for money though, and my husband was too nice to ever turn her down, so we were still paying her bills occasionally.

My grandfather died on father’s day 2017, and then she took another turn for the worst. I’m pretty sure she was (maybe still is) abusing some kind of prescription drug that was left over from my grandfather, which she used to attempt suicide that November. Then she had a ministroke a couple weeks later, brought on by stress of having no money to pay bills and being unable to find a job since she now had a years-long gap in her employment history.

Thankfully it wasn’t long after she recovered from the stroke that she was able to get a job and seemed to be doing well for awhile, though I suspect she went back to drinking and doing pills despite her doctor demanding she get help for it.

Other things occurred during this whole timeline, like: she opened a credit car in my name when I was 18 and ran the limit all the way up without paying so my credit is absolute shit, talked me into giving up all of my savings (about $5,000) I’d been planning on using for a car when I was 17 to pay off a different credit card she’d run up in her own name, gave up my dog to an animal shelter without telling me after I moved out despite promising to keep her until my husband and I found a place that would accept dogs, and most recently got drunk at my baby shower and spent the whole thing embarrassing me in front of my friends and husband’s family members. Those are just the tip of the iceberg.

I am pregnant with my first child, and I don’t think I can handle the stress she brings on me anymore. I just don’t want someone like her around my child, to be frank. However, I’m not sure I could ever completely cut her off because she is still my mother and really the only family I have left by blood (other than my unborn daughter). As much as I feel like I hate her sometimes, I’m still afraid to cut her off and something has stopped me every time. 

I guess I’m just looking for someone to tell me I’m right in telling her that I can’t have myself or my family involved with her any longer, and to maybe tell me how I should go about this. I can’t just go no contact because I know that won’t work, she’ll show up at my house or my husband’s job, and I just want to make it a clean cut. Does anyone have any experience in a similar situation or any words of advice?

TL;DR: My mother has displayed an extremely toxic set of behaviors my entire life, and since I will be having my first child soon, I don’t want her in mine or my family’s lives anymore. Looking for advice on how to go about cutting ties."
53,"My [32F] husband [32] male constantly gives me the silent treatment. (married 2 years)


Like the title said, my husband gives me the silent treatment anytime something doesn’t go as he wanted. It can last for a few hours to a few days or weeks even. He won’t speak to me respond to messages or even acknowledge me if we’re in the same room. Sometimes he locks me out of the bedroom so I have to sleep in the guest bedroom. The latest example: 

I had lab and radiology tests for something very minor and just “checking” things out on Thursday of last week. It was at a military hospital and everything seems a little more difficult with their process. 

Friday (the day after) he asked me if I had called to check on the results, I had forgotten so I told him and said I would do it next week (this week). Monday, I also forgot ( I work a very demanding job and am usually nonstop for 10+ hours), the clinic is open like 8-4 and by the time I remembered it was closed. I told him I would call Tuesday. 

We were lovey Monday night (he’s traveling) and first thing Tuesday morning I called and the only way I could find to “get results” was leave a message with the nurse and they have a recording saying they call back in three business days. (I also work an hour away so it’s not like I can just ‘pop’ in). The tests aren’t anything pressing and he won’t be able to do anything about it until he gets back in three weeks. 

Tuesday morning I text and say “ hey babe I called the clinic and left a message and they said it could take three business days to call me back”. He gets mad at me and says I need to call my primary care provider directly to ask for the results and that I shouldn’t have to leave a message and he doesn’t understand why I can’t get the results. Now I have called every number to the clinic to the hospital,from the lab to Radiology and I’m always re-directed to voicemail. Then he says if you’re too busy just let me know, focus on your job I have to go. 

Now flash forward to Wednesday night and nothing. No response to my texts or calls (I called twice). He’s traveling and I know he’s available after 5pm each day... and I’m home with my heart aching feeling worthless even though I don’t think I did anything wrong. I know that this behavior is how his mom treated him growing up so I guess it’s the only coping method he knows. 

TL:DR husband gives me the silent treatment, How can I stop making it bother me and hurt me so much?"

I went out with a girl for almost 5 years, from when we were 16 to 21 (We’re both 22 now). I was her first boyfriend, we were eachother’s first love, and when we were together she never really liked sex or anything sexual. Our relationship later began to brake down gradually, we started arguing a lot and not enjoying eachother’s company. 
 We broke up for the first time in the summer of last year. I noted she was getting along really well with one of our friends, so I told her that she should be with him because I wanted her to be happy. I found out months later that she had been getting with him in secret. Suddenly she liked sexual things and all our friends knew about them being together and no one told me. I was hurt that I wasn’t told about it, not so much that they were together. 
Throughout the few months we were broken up we still kissed and she would say she still loved me, even though she continually said we wouldn’t get back together. Eventually we did back together in October. Throughout the time we were together again I tried my best to be better and not create any arguments. She would tell me sometimes that I was on a ‘trial period’ and near the end she kept saying she loved me more like a brother than romantically. One time I told her that I still wanted to marry her and she didn’t answer. I knew what would end up happening. 
Eventually we broke up again in May. 
A week after we break up she comes up to me saying she met a guy and that ‘he’s really cool’ and I’d ‘really like him’. They spent a lot of time together and of course she had sex with him too. She then got tired of him and dated our friend again in secret. But one night she texted me while drunk saying she misses me and still loves me. That she gets sad almost every day, especially when she sees couples doing normal boring things. 
I saw her a few weeks after that, and she was very sad. She told me she was going to break up with our friend and that us breaking up a mistake. She still wants to be with me, she still wants to marry me, but first she wants to go out and party and ‘have fun’. The day after they broke up we hung out and spent the day together. We kept telling eachother that we love and are still in love with eachother. 
It was the calmest I’d been in a long time. I’ve spent every day since we broke up in a lot of sadness, and it was all lifted away during that day. Everything felt right. But then a few days later the situation hit me. 

Two of my friends tell me that this is really unfair. And part of me agrees. What type of love is it to make getting with other guys and partying every night? She goes out a lot now, and I basically try to block it out. I can’t justify the situation but I can rationalize it by pretending that I don’t know we’re going to get back together. 
I even told her that this was unfair, and she said that these were her terms, and I could either accept them or not. 

I really don’t want to, even though I’m suffering a lot, but should I finally leave her behind once and for all? "

I’m looking for advice or another point of view sorry for the bad grammar here as well but here’s my problem: So me and my gf have been going out for 8 months now everything has been amazing until this month ever since half way through September my gf has completely changed she’s gone from practically living with me to never coming round and whenever she promises to come round she always cancels last minutes and says she feels sick or has lots of stuff to do which I would say fair enough if it was a few times but this has been going on for an entire month now X she was ill with a chest infection which I thought was fair Enough so didn’t think anything of it and gave her space but now it’s literally been over a month and she’s still saying she’s ill. Also she used to always want to have sex and do it multiple time now she just gets annoyed if I even bring it up and she never wants to do it I just don’t know what’s happened I went from seeing her everyday to not at all for a month and from her to be always up to sex to her not wanting it at all.

Does anyone know what might be up or anything as I really have no idea what’s happened it’s getting to the point where we don’t even feel together anymore I see her and there’s not intimacy anymore she doesn’t even like to kiss me much anymore either. I love her to bits and don’t want to lose her but I can’t work out wherever she is trying to get me to break up with her or if it’s me just over thinking I need another point of view m.

Tl;dr barely see my gf anymore when before we used to see each other all the time and now there’s always some reason she won’t come round."

59,"Last will or manipulation?


Hello Reddit. This post is going to be long, you will find a TLDR at the bottom. Thanks in advance for taking the time to read it.

My mom (58F) and my dad (55M) are from different countries and I (25F) have always lived in my dad's home country. However, every summer we travel to my mom's home country to visit and spend time with that part of the family. Until here, fine. 

My grandparents are getting old (they are in their 80's) and are arranging all the legal affairs for when they have to leave our world. They don't have a big fortune, but hey, they built a nice countryside house with some land attached to it. 
Apart from my mom, my grandparents have 2 other daughters (my aunts, in their 50's). 

This summer, my mom told me that grandpa wanted to sign his last will. And one of his last wills is to not sell the house and to keep it in the family. That's actually not a problem since one of the sisters, let's call her sister A, wants to keep the house. 
Everything sounds fine, my mother goes to the lawyer with my grandparents and she signs like she is ok with the agreement. At this point, something smelled fishy to me, since you don't normally need your descendants' signature to state your last will.

Fast forward to now, my mom shows me the document, and it wasn't the last will. It was a contract which stated that from January 1st 2019, the house will change owner, and the new owner is going to be my aunt, sister A. My grandparents will have the right to have a room and the costs covered but no ownership. And my mother and my other aunt have the right to claim their ""part of the house"" only for the next 25 years. 

Not only did I find fishy that everything has been done ""secretly"", but also the fact that my aunt has stopped answering my mom and my other aunt's calls. 

And the worst of it all is that 1) the sister that is becoming the owner is a high order of a religious sect, 2) has a lot of financial liabilities and I know for a fact she will get a credit giving the house as a bank guarantee and 3) I am extremely worried about my grandparents not having their property until they are both dead (because what if they need to pay for an expensive treatment, a social worker or something like that). I also think they deserve to have their house until their last breath, having it how they want it. And not having to risk it over a person who has no financial planning.

I know that my grandparents are making a big mistake. I also think sister A has manipulated the situation for years so her parents have pity for her. Now, whenever you mention this topic to my grandad, he gets tense, into defensive mode and says that my mom and my aunt are just looking to get ""more than their sister"".

How could I help in this situation? How can I make him think about it again? Do you think I'm doing the right thing? Don't you think it's fishy that my aunt and my grandparents haven't given us a real reason why the ownership has to change now?

TLDR: grandparents are giving their house to one of their daughters but before they are dead and I think it is all a manipulation from my aunt who has run out of money and needs a bank guarantee for credit."

Throwaway for obvious.

&amp;#x200B;

I don't think that I am happy in my relationship. I've been with her for a little over 10 months and we are going to be moving in together at the beginning of the year. Nothing too seriously wrong with that. However my feelings I don't think are concrete as hers. I don't know if I want to spend the rest of my life with her. I love her and don't want to hurt her, but in actuality, I don't see myself being in the relationship by the end of next year. I'm not the person who I truly am with her, nor can I comfortably express myself in ways I seem fit.

 I don't blame her for her differentiating opinions, but there's only so much flexibility someone can do before they become unhappy, and I wouldn't be surprised if there were some major things I wasn't fulfilling in the relationship either. I just feel like a shit person. I'm trying to better my current situation but I feel like I'm using my girlfriend as leverage to get ahead in life when I know that we probably won't last a few years. I just don't know what to do at this point. I can't talk to her because we will end up breaking up but I don't want to break up with her, but I also don't want things to go on for too long and something happens like I accidentally get her pregnant or something. Do I just wait out this period of personal growth (ie. moving, she graduates next semester) for the both of us and then end things after things have settled down? Or....I don't know. 

I think I just need some justification, whether what I'm doing is right or wrong. Like I said, I love her and wouldn't dare try to hurt her, but I love myself too, and I think that I would be happier with someone else that is more fit for me, as would she."

63,"Should I(30m) worry that she (34f) is acting a little distant lately? Or not yet?


This woman (34f) and I(30m)have been talking great for about a month now. And I mean great.

But this past Friday all of a sudden she said ""ugh, I'm nervous"" I asked about what and she didnt reply. So I just kind of brushed that aside and then when Monday came, she wasnt at work so I texted her ""hope everything is okay and you're not sick again"" something like that.

She sent back a goodmorning and that she just had a migraine affecting her senses and wanted a day off. Then yesterday came around and what I thought was weird was, instead of saying goodmorning or anything, she texted me ""are you here today?"" I told her no since it's my say off and she replied oh yeah I forgot, my days are mixed up now from my day off"" We texted here and there for the next few hours and she said her headache is better when I asked her about it and that I was sweet for asking, but then today, nothing. 
(I should add that this didnt feel like her texting, not her usual self. Being distant. )

I thought it may be her losing interest in me for some reason but I cant imagine that being it since just Friday she was telling me why she found me attractive and was being flirty (being herself with me). And then also how she said I was sweet yesterday so I cant think imagine the interest was lost.

If she wants to be left alone, I dont want to come off as annoying in a sense if I say hope her day is well since I basically said that to her that yesterday.

Also, about a month ago she told me that she just got through with her period (yes its weird she told me and I even was like ""it's kinda weird you told me that tbh"" but whatever) But maybe it's that time of month again for her so it may just be that? (NO, I am not being derogatory, it's an honest sincere thought/possibility)

**tl;dr** A woman has started acting distant to me for a few days and I'm not sure how to take it. Just the other day she was telling me what makes me so attractive to her and flirting and talking personally. We have been talking like this for about a month

65,"Me (20 f) with long distance boyfriend (21M) of 1.5 years- the distance is starting to wear me down and I don't know what to do


Some context: me and my boyfriend met online, got along well, started dating shortly after non-exclusively for a few months before becoming exclusive and official. We live in the same time zone but quite a few hours away by train (10+).  We are very compatible with level of communication, physical chemistry, humor, etc. and manage to see each other about once a month for a few days at a time. We are both in university.

&amp;#x200B;

The trouble began at around April of last year. He has always been a very busy person- he takes on lots of side projects, jobs, etc. both related to his study and not. Around April it got to the point that we regularly couldn't speak more than quick updates of our days. It really saddened me, especially around the end of the university year when I had exams and was also very stressed and really just wanted to see him or at least talk to him. However due to his busy schedule and at the time my exams we didn't manage to talk deeply very often. Once my exams finished he had his and our communication dipped again. I very clearly expressed that it was hard on me to not \*really\* talk to him for so long. He said the same and told me to hang on until his year was over. 

&amp;#x200B;

June was alright, I got busy with work but after that month was over we saw each other and things seemed great communication wise until mid-July. He picked up a lot of side-jobs and projects over the summer months so even when I wasn't studying, seeing friends, etc. he was almost never available for a real chat. I expressed my frustration with him again and then it was ""hang on until my next visit"". Communication picked up again by August and his visit was very nice. 

&amp;#x200B;

September rolled around and then we were both really busy with academics. It was around this month that I started feeling the physical frustration. I don't have a high libido or anything but now I constantly crave physical contact. Not just sexually, but things like hugs, cuddling, kissing, etc. I get plenty of that when I see him in person but that's only once a month. I think I need more than that. We now talk daily as before and have nice conversations, but for the first time it doesn't feel like enough.

&amp;#x200B;

I really love him, and I know he loves me (he says it all the time). I still feel lost. I keep reading that distance can work if you want it but we can't set an end date for at least a few years realistically. How can I deal with my need for physical intimacy? Texting doesn't satisfy this need for me. We've talked about it before but he seems to deal with lack of physical intimacy much better than I do, so we were at a loss. 

&amp;#x200B;

\*TL;DR: Me and my long-distance have a healthy relationship and are in love but the lack of physical contact is really bothering me.\*"

He says he barely does anything so there is no point in showering. I told him no matter what there is a buildup of bacteria on him and for him to at least wash his ass. He has very bad body acne because of this. He then got upset and said ""Why would I take care myself if it won't make you love me more?"". I then told him I love him still, I just wish he had proper hygiene and I wanted to help him with that. I'm a teenager and I feel like the adult in this relationship. Advice?"
67,"My girlfriend/best friend [F22] of 3 years suddenly cut all contact with me [F21] and told me she never loved me in the first place. Help me to understand?


So I made a post about a week ago on here discussing the same situation. I ended up deleting it seeing as it was a jumble of emotions and was honestly just waaayyy too drawn out. So here I am again, asking for advice on a different aspect of the situation.



I dated a girl (we'll call her A) for all of 2016 and 2017. Our relationship had it's ups and downs due to many reasons and at the beginning of 2018 we decided to break up but remain best friends.  During our relationship A was so madly in love with me it was ridiculous. I was her entire world to an almost unhealthy point I would say. Around this time last year is when we finally broke up and she was in shambles. I too was in shambles but it was so much worse for her. It was so bad that her parents actually called me asking me to please come back because they were worried their daughter was going to kill herself.


Anyways, so that just goes to show how much A seemed to care about me. Flash forward to the past two months, we are still friends and everything appears to be going well. I am set to move across the country and that's when A begs and pleads for me not to go because she was having trouble with her girlfriend and needed my support.  I try to help her but in the end I end up moving anyway.   

Flash forward about a week and I'm now at my new place across the country. A and her girlfriend have broken up and 3 days later she has a new girlfriend. One day A calls me and is acting different so I ask what's up. She tells me she thinks she was never in love with me in the first place and that we can't be friends because her new girlfriend is worried about me. I (and I really wish I hadn't done this) kind of freaked out and told her that none of this makes sense. I told her I was worried about how fast she was dating another new girl and told her how I can't possibly believe she never loved me.  She claimed she was confused throughout the years and realizes now she just ""loved me as a friend""

Since that conversation she has blocked me on everything, deleted all traces of me off social media, and refuses to give any reasoning as to why this happened saying I don't deserve the ""satisfaction"". Oh, and she also thinks I slashed her tires and I didn't. I wasn't even in the state!

Basically I'm just horribly confused and have been crying nonstop for the past week. I have no idea what to do with myself and I'm trying so hard to understand why on earth she cut me out. I'm also scared she has turned her family against me as well, which hurts so bad because they were basically my family too. All of this is causing me so much unbearable pain.  Any advice on how to move past this or to understand what on earth happened? I understand we were having disagreements but this is just so extra to me....

We have lots of fun together and he says I'm great, but his actions and other things he says makes me feel like a filler girlfriend.

&amp;#x200B;

Examples:

\-He constantly talks about how he's not ready for marriage or kids acting like I automatically want that with him, but I've never said anything about that with him. Just if it ever comes up at all he talks about how he isn't ready.

\-He blows me off if anyone else shows him any attention. Buddies want to hang out? Cya later... Most of the time he has no plans so we hang out all the time.

\-He doesn't post me in public on social media. Everyone else he has dated has been up there immediately. He also posts quite frequently. 

\-We almost broke up once and he unadded me on everything immediately, but i had to basically force him to cut bait with a girl he'd gone on a few dates with like had to throw a huge fit and the last one was about a pic he posted of her on facebook which lead to our only picture together being posted... 

\-Only told me he loved me when I was ready to walk. He also doesn't tell me much.

\-Drove long distance for other girls, but can't be bothered to come to my house 10 minutes away

\-When we started dating he said SUPER sexually inappropriate things to me and pushed super hard for sex and I told him to stop and he did, so we kept dating. He treated me like a hookup from the get go, but later wanted to be boyfriend girlfriend.

69,"[M21] broken up with [F19] cheating, lying girlfriend, she sucksd his dick.


TL;DR at the end.

So. I've posted about bits of this here and there, but this is probably the final point and I'm really at a loss for what to do or how to feel now.

Backstory: started dating Nov 26th last year and all things seemed good. First relationship for both of us, first for either of us sexually all of your good romantic relationship movie tropes.

Eventually found out she was sexting other guys throughout the relationship, she pulled heavy breakup manipulation which I can't say or the post will be removed, and I tried to fix it.

Then she tried to strong arm me into an open relationship, things like how she would never be happy if she's not allowed to sleep with other people etc. The ""agreement"" was for me to go to sex classes, which you have to pay for btw, for us to stay together, I had no intention of going.

I would have just told her it's done but she was literally homeless for the next few days and staying at mine until new leases started.

So I still tried despite everyone I know pretty much telling me to leave, alas we are a naive species the first time we experience these things.

(I should also note that I went as far to help her move 3 times to get away from her abusive parents)

Anyways. Come Saturday we argue about the sexting and how she liked to throw it in my face that the version of events she told a friend painted me as a monster. She told me to get out and I finally called her out on all of the lies in front of her roommate and left.

We were broken up.

Come yesterday night and this morning, que 4am. She's texting me and says. She doesn't want a relationship anymore, but she wants to hookup for non-emotional sex, not a big fan of the idea so it passes. She then started telling me she was a horrible person and it would effect us being friends, so I finally pry out what happened.

The night we broke up she went and sucked my buddies dick, and when I asked how and why, she said ""it just happened"". I think that's bullshit and anyone I've been asking for help emotionally says so too. I think she did it and told me to hurt me.

Unless he slipped and his dick just fell into her mouth I don't buy it.

So I called and told her that I never want to see her again and she's a garbage person for all the shit she caused and with everything I did to help. She had such an easy time going and doing that like it didn't mean anything at all.

So reddit. What do I do now? I feel empty, angry, depressed. I understand we were technically broken up but she didn't even wait a day. I've never felt this before and I'm honestly a little bit terrified of what comes next...

TL;DR: just broke up with girlfriend because she was sexting other guys, then she rubbed it in my face that she sucked my buddies dick immediately after because it ""just happens""."

So for some context my friend Nat and I hang out most days we are off. She usually comes over to my house because she was living with her mom for awhile. 

She recently moved into a sublet with a girl Brenda she has known for awhile. I went over to her apartment for the first time so I could see it and meet her friends. One of her friends Dia was already there, we met and talked etc she was super nice! 

We were sitting at her dining room table smoking, Nat, Dia and I, having a perfectly pleasant time. It is relevant to the story that I am white and Dia, Nat and Gigi are all black. Keep in mind I have never met Dia or Gigi before. 

Gigi comes home, says hi to Nat and Dia, and Nat says “oh this is my friend katechopin!” And I started to say hi to her and she says “oh you’re afraid of black people, right?” Turned of her heel, and went upstairs. We all look at each other but I brushed it off. I didn’t even have time to reply before she turned away. 

Later I brought it up and Dia and Nat both said it was completely out of left field and they have no idea what made her say that. I suspect maybe something Nat has said to her before about my triggered it, but I don’t know what and neither does Nat. I love Nat and I know she would never say anything about me that would make her Gigi think I’m racist or anything of the sort. 

Nat is fuming and super mad, wants to move out etc. she’s very uncomfortable with the situation. Gigi has been tweeting things like “no one is entitled to my respect or kindness” etc etc. and Nat wants to say something to her. 

I guess I am looking for general advice on what to do, for both me and Nat? What should Nat say to her? Has anyone been in a similar situation? I’m not super comfortable going over there anymore because of this, but that’s not fair to Nat. 

TLDR; met my friends roommate for the first time, she made me feel super uncomfortable, what should we do? "

Hi everyone, this is my first time posting here! My relationship with my girlfriend has been amazing so far, she seriously rocks. Im not sure this is the community to ask in but sometimes she gets into moods where it seems like anything I do really ticks her off. Its becoming a more commonly occurring theme and I was wondering if there is anything that I could do to improve her well being. Ive noticed that trying to make her feel better usually puts her in a worse mood, so I was wondering if there is anything to do when I notice she is getting annoyed/emotional. Any advice on how to approach her without making her feel like im just forcing ways to feel better on her? Once shes in a mood she usually stays in it till the next day. 

We do have a great relationship otherwise, I was just wondering from the perspective of someone who has been in a serious relationship before what helps. Thanks!

72,"Ex and I broke up but now he's back after I started moving on


This may be a bit long so I apologize for the length in advance. I'm just very confused and feel skeptical of my own judgment at this point so some unbiased perspective would be greatly appreciated. 

&amp;#x200B;

My ex boyfriend (21) and I (20) of 2 years ended things almost 3 months ago. He was going through what I suspected at the time to be a wave of depression (now confirmed by him after he talked to a therapist) and I tried to support and let him know I would be there for him during it, albeit I'm not sure if that was what he really needed (I understand everyone experiences it different and has different needs). The day after he expressed he was feeling lost, confused, and didn't know how to handle it, he ended things with me. I was dealing with some difficult family issues outside of our relationship at the time and when he broke up with me, I held composure and was going to leave because I could feel my anxiety building quickly (I'm prone to anxiety attacks when overwhelmed). I knew we both needed time to process what was happening, but he wouldn't let me leave his apartment and I just broke down in a full on attack which I regret and feel utterly embarrassed about. He consoled me and helped me calm my breathing then said he made a mistake and wanted to get back together. I asked him if it was because he felt guilty for my attack and seeing me so emotional (yikes still embarrassed) and he repeatedly said no. It was so confusing, he told me we were going to get dinner and was hugging me, stroking my hair, kissing/holding my hands immediately after all of this like nothing happened and I felt guilty because I figured it was because he felt bad about my reaction. A few days later, I told him that he should consider talking to a professional to help guide him because I didn't think I could help him in the way he needed and that maybe we should go on a break so he could take care of himself. He admitted he did mean it when he broke up with me and he did feel guilty about my reaction. I reassured him I'd be alright and to focus on his own health. We mutually went on a break and he told me he didn't want to talk to other people (said it wasn't about seeking other girls out or anything like that, solely about him) &amp; for me to not talk/see other guys. I agreed and said I didn't want us to end things, that I loved him, but I wanted him to be happy and healthy, whatever that meant for us. 

&amp;#x200B;

A few weeks passed and he deleted his social media apart from facebook and twitter. He removed his relationship status and changed his profile pictures. I asked him about it and he basically said he wanted me to be happy, that if another man came along and made me happy I shouldn't wait for him. We officially broke up on good terms although I didn't want to. He told me he wanted to continue talking and that he needed me as a friend. He said he still had hope for us down the road after he worked on himself and he saw me in his future. I agreed, as I couldn't see my life without him being in it. Over the course of a few weeks, it went from positive talk, saying I missed him etc. and asking him how he was doing, to which he said he wasn't well. He said he felt angry or just ""not there"" most of the time. I worried about him constantly and kept trying to reach out. He got more distant and began having a short temper with me. He would ask how I was doing and when I told him how I felt, he would get angry and say when he asks that, he just wants to know if I'm staying strong or not (not the details of how I felt towards him). When I would say how I felt, he would tell me that made him feel bad and I was just trying to make him feel even more guilty (he said this to me over and over, so I felt really horrible because I was worried I was putting more on him). I pulled back and apologized, I told him I respect that he needed this and it wasn't about me, but please don't push me away. He did and I later found out through a friend that he had been talking to other girls during the time that he turned cold towards me. I texted him and said I knew he'd been talking to other girls and to please be honest with me so I could move on with my life. He said it was true and that I should talk to other people because he didn't know what he was doing with his life, to which I simply said ""Thank you."" I felt like I could breathe again and that this was the way things were supposed to go. I wasn't for him, I had to accept that so I did. I did the whole listening to break-up songs, talked to my friends about it, and went out. I stopped contacting him. A while passed and I was thinking less and less about it. 

&amp;#x200B;

Then he contacted me asking my whereabouts and who I was hanging out with. I'm not sure why I told him, but I did. He then started texting me about all of the mistakes he made, apologizing profusely, saying losing me was his biggest mistake, he was depressed and didn't know how to deal with it at the time, I was his happiness, he wasn't happy because he lost me, etc. I told him he had to be happy within himself and he had to make an effort to get better for himself, not me. He continued to pursue me, begging me to talk to him and take him back. I said I needed time and space because my head was spinning again but he hasn't really stopped. We ran into each other and he hugged me, kissed my head, and asked if he could kiss me but I told him I didn't think it was a good idea. He later texted me after the run-in and asked if I didn't want to kiss him because I didn't feel that way towards him anymore. I had started talking to another guy right before he started texting me all of this and when he found that out, it intensified. He would send me streams of texts and a long email confessing his love for me. He told me he talked to other girls because he wanted attention to make himself feel better (one girl in particular rejected him in high school and he wanted to see her so she would ask him out and he could reject her back ????). He's been talking to our university therapists which have referred him to a psychiatrist outside of the school (I didn't ask, he texted me this information out of the blue) to prove he'd been working on himself and he felt grounded again, that he was ready to be the man I needed and that we could see what our issues were and how to fix them now. (I distanced and shut down during arguments, I always tried to leave the scene during those times when he wanted to talk it out at that moment, he lied about numerous things, thought I was unfaithful -- I would never, other things I can't seem to place right now). I'm SO confused I can't think straight and now I've been talking to this other guy, just flirting and we hung out 3 times, which I feel guilty for. It's not fair to the other guy and it's not fair to my ex. I told my ex I didn't want to get back together because there had been too much hurt and I was scared it would happen again. He called me immediately crying and screaming that he needed me in his life and I was his girl. This conversation went on for a while and I felt so horrible so I ended it with saying I needed a few days of no contact. I was second-guessing myself YET AGAIN. My ex also texted the other guy I was talking to streams of text messages basically saying back off and that we were going to work things out, that he loved me and he had been going through things the new guy couldn't understand. He sent long messages to my mother too. So.. I feel very lost myself at this point.

&amp;#x200B;

Do I give my ex another shot or try to cut it off again? I already told the other guy I wasn't ready for anything, that I'm taking time for myself to get my head on straight after the relationship and he said he was just going with the flow, he wasn't in any rush which is so different from my ex, but after saying that is when the ex came back in the picture. 

&amp;#x200B;

Any advice would be amazing. If you stuck through that whole novel, thank you so much for reading lol "
73,"Married woman wondering about a FWB relationship with a married man


 

I've been married for about 10 years and while I love my husband dearly and in no way want to leave him, the spark has faded. I have always liked variety when I was dating so its been a struggle just being with one person for such a long time. Recently I was at a happy hour with one of my ex coworkers. We were close friends when we worked together and we always had chemistry even though we never acted on it because we both had SO's and I don't date coworkers. Anyway, when we talked at the HH, it was obvious the chemistry was still there and we had a good time doing some innocent flirting. We ended up having a private conversation and he revealed he was in the same situation. He has been married for around 10 years as well and he loves his life with his wife but things in the bedroom are seriously lacking.

During the conversation he proposed that we become FWB and finally act on the sexual tension between us. We did NOT do anything at the HH because he wanted to discuss ground rules and not rush into anything we would immediately regret. He made good points that since we are both in similar situations and know exactly what this would be, neither of us would overly attached and expect the other to leave their spouse. We are also both adults where neither of us would get angry (disappointed yes) if the other started feel uncomfortable and wanted to end the ""with benefits"" part. Neither of us want to to leave or hurt our SO's, but this would be able to scratch that itch without things getting messy.

He wants to take it slow if we decide to do this with only making out at first and after that we can decide if we want to go further. There are no kids involved with either of us. It seems like a perfect arrangement to get what I want without upending either of our lives. There is no way our SO's would agree to an actual open relationship so that option is off the table. We are both very type A personalities so we both agree we should never actually be in a relationship with each other because we would be constantly butting heads.

I am so torn and I go back and forth on what I should do. What do the women of Reddit think?

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR

Should I have a FWB relationship affair with a married man to give us both what we are missing in our current relationships. No chance of leaving our SO's or having an open relationship."

These two girls I met (online) but added on social media act in a way I don't understand. They are not the same people they don't even know each other what I mean is how they respond to me. As of now we are just friends but every time I've sent either of them pictures of me they always call me ""cutie"" or ""cute :)"" in their responses. I really don't know if i'm getting friendzoned hardcore or if they are actually interested. W

We have deep convos and I don't actively hit on either of them. I have called them both beautiful or complimented them and they weren't like ""no we're just friends"" they seemed flattered but it's still SO complicated. I know it's just online people I met so it might not even go anywhere (btw I would only date one at a time if I even could) but please can someone help me understand how girls like them think. I'm scared to make a move cause idk what will happen.

TLDR: Girls replying to my photos calling me ""cutie"" or saying ""cute :)"" does this mean friendzone or no? "

He dropped me off at work this morning and afterwards I couldn't help but message him that I'm into him and it's making me crazy. I shouldn't have done this because I know that he doesn't feel the same way and I don't wanna lose his friendship and other ""benefits"" that I get. Obviously he saw the message but hasn't replied. How do I make this situation lighter? I really shouldn't have said anything because I think he will get scared away and that's it. Help! Thanks

77,"I [M27] don't know how to process the ""relationship"" I had with [F24] for four months and how to process the ending - something just feels weird.


  

I apologize for the length – I’m not sure if this is too long, but I feel like I can’t really properly explain everything without going in to some detail. 

It’s kind of a long story with a lot of details I promised I wouldn’t divulge, so I’ll try to condense it as best I can while also respecting her privacy. For this story, I’ll call her Amy. I met Amy via dating apps at the end of June, and with the exception of one hiccup in the first week, things were going pretty great. We were attracted to each other, we were talking every day, via text and phone, and we had a lot in common. The only thing I found weird at the time, was that she wanted to take it SUPER slow, and I’ll divulge: We actually met within the first week of talking, but because things moved a little quickly (no physical intimacy, but we did get a little close and I stayed at her place a bit too long, I’ll admit), she wanted to not meet up again for two months. She said she had had a bad experience with the last guy she had dated, who was a “psycho” and had manipulated her, so she wanted to properly vet me. I wasn’t jazzed about the idea, but because of the connection we had, I thought being patient wouldn’t be a bad thing. 

Well, it didn’t take that long to see her again. She went out drinking with friends a few weeks later and asked if I could give her and her friend a ride home. After we dropped of her friend, I drove her back home. She wasn’t sober at the time, and to be extra careful, I asked her if she just wanted me to drop her off or to walk her up and then leave. She thanked me for asking her, and told me she wanted me to go inside with her and stay for a while. I shouldn’t have, but I obliged. While there, she asked me to take a few drinks to “get on her level” – I resisted because I wanted to make sure she was okay, but eventually I made the (dumb) decision to agree to drink a bit in exchange for her drinking Powerade. I had a total of about 4 drinks, so my reservations were now gone, but I wasn’t drunk. Things escalated from there, she asked for a back rub which turn in asking me to go to her room and watch tv with her, which then turned into us making out heavily and being handsy. We didn’t have sex – she made a passing comment that I would be blue balled and, at one point, after me asking what she wanted me to do and her saying “anything you want”, she told me “except that” when I started to take things a bit further. I obliged and didn’t try it again. Eventually we both fell asleep, we woke up, she asked if I could drive her back to pick up her car from the night before, held my hand the whole way, and we went our separate ways. And then later that day came the text telling me it had all been a mistake. And the next day, after thinking about it, she told me should couldn’t trust herself around me and we shouldn’t see each other, much less be friends. I was pretty shattered but I didn’t fight her on it (after a previous relationship, I’ve made the decision to never beg a girl to stay). I thought I’d never hear from her again. 

Except I did, the next day, albeit just a quick message. Eventually things got back to normal, and she told me she didn’t blame me for things going too fast. However for about the next three weeks, she’d occasionally text me that she wanted me to come over and cuddle with her, but quickly backtrack saying it would be a mistake. Eventually I asked her why it would be, and she really couldn’t give me an answer, so she agreed to have me come over and watch a movie with her, on the condition we don’t get close physically and I leave by a set time. I did, and I stuck to her parameters and went home. And she thanked me for making her feel better about everything. She was gonna go to a festival out of town that weekend, and we agreed to see each other when she would get back. I honestly thought we were making a lot of progress. But, unfortunately, everything after that festival changed a lot. I won’t go into detail, but she told me she had a bad experience, and when she came back, she wasn’t in a good place. I was there for her, and I knew she was appreciative, but she was no longer flirty, no longer invited me over, and wouldn’t see me for some time. When she started feeling better, we started hanging out again, but only in public places, which I was perfectly cool with. In my view, knowing that bad experiences she had in the past, I just needed to show her she could be comfortable with me. We’d still talk a lot, we’d hang out a lot, and we were still getting along very well – just no more flirting from her end. 

That’s when I started noticing that she was afraid her friends would find out about me. She told me she didn’t want anyone prying in to her private life, but it was a really odd change (considering I had been with her at her school once and I had driven her and friend back from the bar). She didn’t want anyone seeing me with her, and (I almost forgot to mention this, but at the beginning I didn’t think it was weird because of how she explained it, but I started to think about it more) she’d only text and call me via snapchat. Very rarely she’d call me the normal way, only when Snap wasn’t working (she did give me her number, but never wanted to text or call on there). I also started realizing just how much she talked about her ex, which had been the only real relationship she had been in, according to her, and they had been together for five years. He was living back home (we’re both from the same place and living out of state in the same place) and they hadn’t spoken since about a week after she started talking to me. 

Then one week she goes home, is texting/calling me all weekend, disappears for a day since it was her family celebrating her birthday (she spent her actual birthday hanging out with me), and then disappeared completely. I texted her a few times the day she was coming back home, but would only get one word replies (this was a Sunday). Then I didn’t hear from her at all Monday, she called me Tuesday morning, we talked for a bit, and she disappeared again until Friday, when she called me asking to see if I wanted to get lunch. She told me she tends to go off the grid when she gets really overwhelmed with school and thanked me for not fighting her on it, which she said every guy previously had done. She told me this would be her hardest semester (grad school, for context), and that the next few weeks would probably be the same. So they were – she’d disappear some days, reappear others, we’d hang out a few times, etc. But at this point, for some reason, I started getting really anxious, feeling uneasy about things, wondering a lot about what the hell was going on, and even starting to have trust issues. This started chipping away at me because I’m not a needy guy, and yet I was starting to feel that way, and that did start manifesting itself in wanting to talk to her more, and being decently cheesy. 

Mind you, this whole time we haven’t been “dating”, and finally as a way to see where I stood, I told her one day that I did want to date her, that I liked her a lot. She turned red and smiled, and told me she didn’t know how to react when I was cheesy like that. She gave me hug and went back to school. We talked for a bit the next day (Friday), and then she disappeared again until Wednesday. But I knew something was different about it this time. She texted me Wednesday asking me if I’d still talk to her if she just wanted to be friends, that she really enjoyed being with me but that she didn’t feel anything more. I’m not an asshole (at least I think I’m not), so I wasn’t going to say no just because the outcome wasn’t preferred. I still cared about her, and I still enjoyed our conversations. She told me she was still here for me, and it seemed that she did really want to keep being friends. I didn’t fight her on it, but did ask how it went from so strong a connection to this – she said she was moving too fast and not thinking, and apologized for potentially misleading me. 

But now it feels like it takes an amount of effort that was never needed to keep talking to her. She seems really distant, won’t really talk or give me one word answers – and this is even when she reaches out. I don’t reach out nearly as often anymore both because clearly the dynamic changed and also I don’t want to give her the idea that I’m pining after her. But all of this has left me feeling really weird, especially since I saw her with her friend and she pretended she didn’t know who I was (because she doesn’t want her friends knowing who I am). My confidence is shattered, I feel like I’m some dirty secret, I don’t know if she ever cared about me, if I was just a rebound she kept around a bit too long, if she liked me a lot but somehow decided to suppress that, and if I’m good enough for anyone. I guess my question is, how do I move on from this, what should I do in regards to her, and was I strung along/played? 

TL:DR: Met a girl, got a long super well and things moved a bit fast, but quickly devolved, realize she wanted no one to know about me but didn’t really question it until things ended, then asked to be just friends but doesn’t really put much effort and still hides me. "
78,"My anxiety [21M] is coming between my long-distance relationship with my S/O [24M]


I know I have anxiety. It made me drop a course, and subsequently start bunking off for days at a time, and it's what finally drove me to drop out of college after six months. But in certain  situations, I find I'm better at hiding it at least. I thought I had it  under control around my s/o, but recently, things have taken a nosedive.  

It's a long distance relationship that's been going for a year and some. In the beginning, when I was in a better head space, we'd talk comfortably for 5+ hours at a time. Skyping is important to him, and so we'd do it everyday. Nowadays, that feels like torture, and I honestly  have to psyche myself up for it. I've never been comfortable around cameras for a few reasons, but sitting in front of one for hours makes my skin crawl. But I do it for them. Things were coasting along well enough, until my mental health took a bit of a hit, and the Skype calls got worse for me. I'd be quiet, mumble, hide my face.

However now, I'm near mute, and have to honestly force myself to talk when he asks me things. He has been nothing but perfect through the relationship, he puts up with my breakdowns and my baggage and everything else, but whenever I go quiet when we're supposed to be  talking, I feel so guilty. Which makes me feel worse, which makes me retreat in to myself more, and the cycle continues. He says it's fine,  and I have no reason not to believe him, but I feel like garbage during every call, even when a second before it, I could have been having the  best day of my life. 

I know I put a lot of pressure on myself to be happy around him, to be a good partner, but right now, I feel like one of us is going to hit a breaking point somewhere, and at this rate I feel like it's going to be me. I love him dearly but I hate Skyping, and now I hate that I hate it, if that makes sense.

I just feel like I've hit a wall and I don't know how to move forward.

TLDR; Skyping makes me a mess and I don't know how to handle it, for the sake of my s/o."

80,"Ex boyfriend [31F] fucked me [30F] out of a business, left me with a pile of debt, and now calls me abusive when I nag him to pick up his cat


So my ex boyfriend and I are both professional chefs and were planning on starting a restaurant together. He has really bad credit, so when we took out the loan we put it in my name. About six months ago, he revealed out of nowhere that he had been unhappy for a very long time and he had fallen in love with someone else. He bailed on the business, leaving me with a massive loan I couldn't pay back on my own, and started a restaurant with this new girl who comes from a wealthy family and put up the capital to start the business.

I was obviously distraught. I tried reasoning with him after he broke the news, but he was gone the next day and moved into the other girl's apartment. Her building doesn't allow cats, so he left his cat behind at our old place telling me it would be temporary until he and the new girl moved.

It's been six fucking months and I haven't heard anything about them moving. I never really bonded with this cat. He was always very mean to me and has gotten extra cranky now that my ex is not around. He also sheds a lot which is a huge pain, and I have not been reimbursed for his food or other cat supplies. I have threatened to send the cat to a shelter, but my ex has threatened to sue me if I do. 

Between the massive loan that is threatening to bankrupt me and the cat that slinks around my apartment as a reminder of this asshole, all I feel every day is a maelstrom of bitterness and rage.  Every time I try to talk to my ex, it escalates into a fight. He calls me ""abusive"" when I lose my temper and tells me that my temper is the reason he held off on breaking up with me for so long, and to not to contact him anymore as he and his new girlfriend no longer feel safe because of me. He then ends every interaction with ""Be well"" which only sends me into an even bigger rage, considering he is the reason why I am not well.

I am so consumed with anger I can't think straight, so I am looking to objective outsiders for advice. What is the smartest way to handle this situation? I know ""calm down"" is probably number 1. What else? 

**tl;dr: Ex-boyfriend pulled out of a business we were planning on starting together, leaving me with a mountain of debt. He moved into another girl's apartment and left his cat behind because her place doesn't take pets. Deflects when I try to call him out.** "

Hello Reddit,

So as the title says I’m in a bit of a quandary. There a girl I’ve fallen head over hills for. This is going to be a hell of a long post so please bare with me. I want you to be brutally honest with me, just be constructive please.

Well, we started talking about 4 months ago. It was July or so. We had sex about 2 weeks again because we were just so in-tuned with each other. I feel like after all of this, the magic is gone.

We had a spat of toxicity, early on because we couldn’t seem to get things right. Basically I asked her if she’d be interested in dating me seriously a month in. She turned me down. I was heartbroken, but I shrugged my shoulders. I asked for exclusivity. Well we had spent so much time being honest with each other that I told her I was pretty hurt by it. I was willing to set my pride aside and it blew up in my face. On top of that she tells me how she used to be all sorts of freaky but she no longer bothers because she doesn’t think guys deserve it. I’m kind of hurt because... like when I tell you, I ate her ass as if I had been starving. Anyway, I did feel a bit insecure as like what made the guys in your life more worthy that I didn’t get the experiences you offered them. I know it’s extremely immature, but I shrugged it off. 

So, now, like I’m talking with another friend of mine [20F] her name is Kris, who I had stopped talking to for a bit. As she was getting her life together. Well she wants to come over and talk, so we go out and gets some food, she also has a son [5Mo] and he’s along for the ride. She comes back to my place and we’re talking and suddenly she like forces herself on me. Her son is in his portable playpin asleep just saying. I reject her advances and she goes crying and stuff saying how she feels so unwanted after the father left and stuff. So I go ahead and do it. After the whole ordeal I felt mortified and sent her home.

I texted Lex, the 23 year old and told her what happened for some reason. I figured we were friends and ultimately I felt guilty. I felt like I had cheated despite us not being a thing because I know she wasn’t really ready for a relationship.

Well she pretty much ignores me as she is in a foul mood. I tried to call her on the phone because I wanted to talk but I couldn’t text because I decided to go for a drive to clear my head. So she ignores me all day and the following day decides to shack up with a guy that liked her for a long time. From what she tells me, there was no penetration but who even knows. I told her that we shouldn’t talk anymore because we’re somehow this toxic when we’re not even an item. We work past this and remain friends.

Fast forward a few months and everything is fine. Until she comes over again. She’s really self-conscious of her body, but I decided to be the most passionate little cunt you ever did meet. Of course she still doesn’t exactly show me all of hidden potential. (Mind you I did ask) All the same she was blown away. So much so that she felt her feelings would get in the way of her logic. So well she wanted to stop talking. This isn’t first time she suggested it, but this was the first time I said I don’t want to keep doing this and I let her go do her thing.

So I meet this new girl [19]. We’ll call her Jay. Well, Jay has a banging body and I figured I’m free so let’s try this. Well about a week in Jay and I are bumping uglies. I know. I’m a ho. And out of nowhere, Lex hits me up. Talking about how she really wants to talk and I tell her no, I can’t keep doing this. Now keeping ‘em honest I had already forgiven and ready to try things again. But immaturity got in my way.

I decided I would try to extend this respite after all. I’m talking with someone else now. I kinda wanted to teach her a lesson but only ended up hurting myself. Now the thing about Jay is she a pretty selfish 19 year old. We went for awhile and because she’s got a small frame she was tired like 15 minutes in but instead of even remotely trying to help me finish she just quits, she just outright tells me no more and I’m pretty upset. I tried two other times since we’re both naked and cuddling. Again she got her jollies off and I’m blue balled as well as tired because trying to sleep while horny is awful. Mind you I love for my partners to get off but at the same time I do feel kinda used. So this whole time I’m thinking... This was an absolute waste of my time and this chick is absolute selfish. 

Following week she has me over and I say fine, let’s try again. Same thing but this time we only try once. Again, she gets off and at this point I’m tired of it so I sleep on the couch. This time was different though, like... Lex. Just kept coming into my head. So I hit her up and she missed me too but she had made a POF (Plenty of Fish) and met some dudes. One she’s doesn’t like at all and no longer talks to. And the other is a guy in his 30’s. He also has a kid that he apparently takes a lot of care of. She ended up pretty much telling him that she just wanted friends and well. He’s been pretty persistent. I did feel a bit inadequate because my life isn’t nearly as together as his or we don’t have the wonders of kids in common.

Anyway, the military guy is married but his wife are going through something or something. She pulls the wife aside after she commented on a Facebook post about this going to the movies though they no longer affiliate to let her know that they’re just friends. Even though they apparently aren’t from what she told me. She then goes out of her way to tell him that his wife is going on a rampage even though they aren’t even apparently cool. Anyway, I told her I just think she kind of invites drama in her life with the way she handles certain situation. She said I was scolding her which I agree, I was and I apologized. She called me out in wanting to feel needed and stuff like that. Which I also didn’t deny, but I don’t think need is the word. I just would like to feel valued for what I do. Like she complains about a lot just to complain but I’m a man of action. If the chick I like complains about something, I want to fix it. Which we’ve gotten into before because she just complains to complain or rather vent. I just want to be useful or helpful or whatever the word is.

I just don’t know what I’m doing there is a lot of firsts for me in this relationship. Like with her being an actually independent and self-sufficient woman. Actually liking a woman with a kid. Actually having her own personality. She’s worn the pants in all her previous relationship as I have in mine so she is independent. I’m an Aries and she’s a Capricorn if that matters. She says she has a reason to live and unconditional love in her daughter (which is flipping awesome). She says she doesn’t really need a man let alone want one, but then why even worry about male friends. I feel like she is a bit short sighted as far as empty nest syndrome is concerned but I’ve no desire to tell her that. I’ll tell you too, I’m pretty good at separating emotion from sex, but not from her. I can’t not catch feelings. Like I actually want to cuddle and I regularly hate cuddling.

Anyway that’s pretty much the gist of it. It may be because I’m young and not aware of my self worth or insecurities due to my position in life. I admit and will own up to my problems. I just would like some advice from you all though I’ve been getting a steady stream from my mom and other her friend. As well as my older friends in their 30’s."

86,"When should I [20sF] ask him [20sM] out...again?


About 3 months ago I asked out a new-ish addition to my friend group. I got turned down because he said he can't deal with a relationship right now. I 100% believe that, it became obvious shortly after that he was in a depressive episode. 


He seems to have come out the other side and is acting like himself again. Even though I asked him out, he took it like a champ and didn't treat me any differently. We've gotten closer over this time as well. My feelings for him have been getting stronger. Feels like I need an explicit rejection/acceptance to move on, but I'm afraid if I ask again too soon and get re-rejected the fallout for my friend group will be bad. I don't want to be too aggressive, you know? I feel like a man pursuing a woman in the same way might be construed as not respecting boundaries. :(


Tl;dr: I asked out a friend, but didn't get explicitly rejected. Should I leave the ball in his court or ask him out again?"

TL;DR we both want to be together but she says she isn't ready. 
  
So I'm usually not the type of person to seek advice on the internet but I'll try to keep this short.
About 3 months ago I met and went on a date with an amazing woman. It went great and things clicked on every possible level. A couple weeks into it she tells me that she isn't sure she's ready for a relationship ( I later found out this is because her last two relationships were very abusive, one being a repeat cheater the other controlling and manipulative) and would prefer to take things slow and understands if I want to end it. I tell her I'm ok with slow, she's ecstatic, we move on. Even going slow we still talk all day and late into the night, every day. Eventually we both admit to each other that we feel something there that we haven't felt with anyone else, I wouldn't call it love but it was...something. I can't describe it.  
  
 Well last Thursday we meet up and towards the end of the night things get hot and heavy but we both agreed that it's best to stop to avoid rushing. Due to schedule conflicts we don't talk much the next couple days until Sunday night she texts me and basically says something is stopping her from taking things further. That I'm amazing and she hates herself for doing this but I deserve so much more than what she can give me right now and it isn't fair to me. She said she needs to get her life together and has no idea how long that will take so she doesn't expect me to wait around for her. I took a couple of days to get my head on straight before telling her that as much as I want to be with her and wish I could help her through this I understand, that I won't promise to wait because it's just not realistic but I'm not going out of my way to find something else and if things change she knows how to get ahold of me. Her only response was ""thank you for understanding and I appreciate you being honest"". Radio silence since

Being the type of person that overthinks things into Oblivion my head is all over the place. Was she full of shit and didn't want a relationship despite telling me she wanted to make things work? Is there someone else? Maybe she's telling the truth and I'll hear from her eventually? I'm at a complete loss and honestly don't know how to go about this anymore. I really like her and feel something special there and don't want to just give up on something great. But on the other hand, what if she's just letting me down easy? What if someone else comes along?"
89,"Thoughts?


Girl I've been friends with for years has recently gotten a lot closer with me. When we hang out, she will lay in bed with me, and expressed a romantic interest in the past. I ignored it because I didn't want to ruin a friendship. Things seem a little more tense now. Did I screw up or will this phase pass?"
