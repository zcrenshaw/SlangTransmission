0,"I (17m) cried in front of my girlfriends dad (40+?)


This is embarrassing. I’m (17m) I have been going out with my gf (17f) for 2 years. I know her parents a little, I mean I’ve seen them at their house gone out for meals with them etc. 

I was at their place on Sunday, it was getting close to my curfew so I was heading home, my car wouldnt start (it has some issues) so her dad drove me home. 

So, I’m on a first name basis with her parents but I wouldn’t say we’re close. There’s also some stuff been going on at home that’s been really hard for me. My parents are splitting, and I just found out I have a half sibling, she’s 13, and the product of my dads affair.

My gf knows a bit of what’s going on, but I try to avoid talking about it because it does tend to make me emotional. 

Her dad was just making small talk with me, and asking about my family. I just lost it. I started rambling, on and on about everything that’s been happening and crying. I’m not sure how much he understood, I was crying pretty hard as I poured it all out. He must have been worried because he actually pulled the car over and gave me a hug. 

He did drop me off at home, my gf hasn’t said anything about it, so I’m guessing he didn’t tell her? 

I’m supposed to see them tonight, it’s her sisters birthday and we’re all going out for supper. I guess I’m afraid it will be awkward. Do I apologize? 

TL;DR: gf’s dad (40+?) drove me (17m)home on Sunday, I wound up crying my eyes out in his car when some of his questions hit home. I’m gonna see him tonight and feel embarrassed and awkward."
1,"[UPDATE] I'm (27F) scared my friend (50M) is becoming isolated during a long hospital stay, but the stigma surrounding his illness (AIDS) limits what I can do


In the original post, [I described](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/bmb8j3/im_27f_scared_my_friend_50m_is_becoming_isolated/) the predicament of my dear friend, a &gt;30-year HIV survivor who suffered massive inexplicable treatment failure and was alone all day in the hospital because he'd kept his condition a secret. I also described my quixotic effort to become his one-woman T cell cheerleading squad. 

I'm sorry to report that my friend has died. After all that could be done was done, he went home and passed away surrounded by his loved ones.

His suffering is over. That's supposed to be the important thing. In the original post, I avoided talking about the suffering. How his intestines had filled with abscesses and bacterial films and Kaposi sarcoma and God knows what else to the point where he vomited fecal matter. How he weighed \~80 pounds and had a bedsore that showed bone.  How the virus had invaded his brain in a way that might have condemned him to Alzheimer's-like deterioration had he lived, even with the newest and best drugs. He'd stolen three decades from HIV and that bastard was out for revenge. Call me a sweet summer millennial child if you like, but it was the worst thing I've ever seen.

Nonetheless, I'd be lying if I said I was taking his death well. I'm writing this  from inside the Pillow Fort of Grief I built in my living room. Redditors have no way of knowing, but he was a wonderful, special person. I opened my heart to him for a reason. The world is a worse place without him.

I'm grateful for the advice of some of those who commented on the original post. I did ease  up on the presents. When I visited the hospital, I focused on just spending time with him. We watched a lot of HGTV, and I would try to  make him laugh by making fun of the questionable taste and skewed priorities of the couples on House Hunters. I held his hand, brushed  his hair, stuff like that. The last time I saw him, I told him I loved him and kissed him on the forehead. He could speak faintly at that  point. He said, ""you're so good to me."" You probably have no idea what that meant; I've always thought of myself as a robot and a moral failure, and he knew it. He was the gift-giver in the end.

On social his husband is maintaining that he died of freak complications  from routine surgery. I wish I could tell him he didn't have to do this, but this very week an authority figure in town went viral for a deranged homophobic rant in which he said, among other terrible things, that AIDS was God's punishment. I feel like I'm trapped in an '80s time warp, but with all the fun parts with the synth music and crazy fashion removed.

I don't know what happens now. Clinical depression? Volunteer work? Befriending the husband? There's a big old void right in the middle of my life. It's the price you pay for caring, sometimes.

TL;DR rest in peace my beautiful friend"
2,"Partner[29M] says he will divorce me [26F] if I put on weight after pregnancy


We've been together for 5 years and in the last year Ive noticed Mark is becoming more judgemental and more self absorbed as hes gotten into weight lifting/body building. Ive tried to remain supportive despite his insensitivity at times however its getting to a point that it really bothers me when he makes random comments towards random strangers he knows nothing about. 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

It started with the random comments about a random stranger that happened to pass us by. He wondered why anyone would put on that much weight, how it was sooooo easy to work out and be in good shape and how lazy they must be to let it happen. I argued with him over it as a- its none of his business he doesnt get to judge someone he knows nothing about and b - its really not that easy. Ive struggled with my weight in the past, I was a chubby/fat teen and I was far from lazy. 

&amp;#x200B;

Things came to head yesterday. Hes been seeing a sports physiologist for the past few weeks. Apparently the guy is fit and muscular and his wife is on the bigger side. Welp Mark would not shut up about how he could not understand why the physiologist would be with his wife. 

&amp;#x200B;

To shut him up, I said maybe she put on weight after kids and that he shouldnt be judging others so cruelly. welp he said hed divorce me if I put on weight even if it was post pregnancy. ( btw Mark wants kids... )

&amp;#x200B;

he expects the weight to magically disappear with the birth of the baby. He went on about how if I respected him, I wouldn't put on weight to begin with.   


I tried telling him that people change and go through different stages in terms of body shape and style etc, it doesnt mean divorce your wife who just carried your child for 9 month but he doesnt get it and kept defending his view

&amp;#x200B;

now I dont feel so secure in my relationship anymore, I feel like hed just walk out on us if I put on some weight whether thats due to stress or illness or pregnancy - does not matter since Mark doesn't seem to have any compassion. 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

I told Mark that maybe we should break up than because I know its not realistic to be in the best shape all the time. He thinks I'm being emotional and dramatic, that theres nothing wrong with us- he just wants me to be the best me for ""both of us"" which I think is bullshit 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

am I being dramatic ? is this something that people change their minds on - and hes just being immature right now because he doesnt get it or should I be concerned about this 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

tl;dr: Partner of 5 years thinks people should never put on weight as he believes its easy to exercise, claims he would divorce if I was to put on weight even if it is pregnancy related"
3,"I'm [25F] considering leaving my boyfriend [26M] of 6 years so that I can gain custody of my drug addicted, imprisoned mom's newborn baby (my sister) and he doesn't want to.


I just need some perspective. I am in a very happy relationship, even thinking about marriage soon. We have no major problems and I've always been happy with him. We both want to have kids, but not yet.

Well that all changed... my mom is addicted to meth and currently in prison because of it. Her boyfriend is 10x worse, if possible. He is not in jail but probably will be soon. They were both extremely abusive and made my life hell.

Well, my mom got pregnant. She just had the baby but was put into prison shortly after. The  baby stays with the dad's family. I feel in my heart that I absolutely cannot allow that to happen. I don't want my sister to have to live the hell I did growing up. I want to gain custody of her and have her live with me. Both my mom and her boyfriend have agreed to allow me to have custody, because they'd rather be out doing drugs anyway.

I know it's not my job to fix my mom's problems, but this is a living baby who will suffer if I don't take her in. 

My boyfriend and I have discussed this and so far, his answer is a firm ""no"". We've had many conversations about this and honestly it's becoming a deal breaker to me. He isn't obligated to take care of the child, this is MY choice and I understand his side, but that may mean we need to break up. He just said he doesn't want a baby straight out of school (he's about to graduate with his phd) and wants to focus on himself/us.

Two points I have considered and need to think more about...

1. Being a single mother is probably one of the hardest things a person can do. I have no kids of my own so I can't even imagine it. I know it's going to be hard, but I feel like I won't really know until it happens. I am a nurse and make plenty of money to support us.

2. It would tie me to my mom forever, basically. Even if she's not the legal guardian she is still my mom and I'm not entirely sure how to handle this.

I know this is probably above reddit's paygrade, but I just want to hear other opinions and things to consider before I make this choice.

Thank you.

**tl;dr** I want to gain custody of my mom's baby but my boyfriend doesn't and I'm considering leaving him."
4,"[UPDATE]: I (24f) am worried my boyfriend (30m) is hiding something bad


Original post didn’t really kick off but here you go: https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/b8gjt3/im_worried_that_my_24f_boyfriend_30m_is_hiding/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=ios_share_flow_optimization&amp;utm_term=control_2

Guys, he was with his ex the whole time. He went on holiday to MALTA with her when he told me he was in Brussels for work. What a toad. I was so taken in. Found out 2 days ago. It’s pretty raw. 

I feel like a total moron, and am totally heartbroken. Honestly, it feels deeply awful. BUT:

- I have booked up my calendar every day for the next 2 weeks with friends, dates, and drinks so I don’t have to be in our shared flat 
- I like my own company. I’m happy alone. He cannot say the same. 
- I might be able to buy part of my own beautiful flat. He’s moving back to his old place with housemates he didn’t like. 
- I will no longer be subsidising his rent. 
- I can name quite a lot of men whom I like and who will date me in a heartbeat. This is, at least, gratifying. 
- He’s 30. He feels he has failed in his career, and that he should be settled down with a life partner by now, etc. I’m 25 (had a birthday) and have a great career that I’ve worked really hard for, with my whole life ahead of me! 
- I’m glad I trusted him after the stuff described in my original post. I’m glad I can be so trusting, even though I was wrong and made a TOTAL mistake. He could never give all of himself to me, because he was too insecure and scared to make that sacrifice, and he will never be happy if he can’t make that leap. I trust easily, and it hurts like a real fucker, but I am strong and only getting stronger! 

Thank you all for your kind words the first time around. I was so silly for not listening, but I’m free now! You’re all great and I am going to get through this and be so much braver and happier afterwards. I hope anyone else in this situation gets out and gets free too. 

Tl;dr: you were right, he was MASSIVELY cheating, but I have dumped his mediocre arse hard and am seriously on the UP."
5,"Update: I [27f] dumped my boyfriend [27m] for using cocaine. Now his friends hate me.


[I posted a few weeks back about breaking up with my boyfriend many months ago for drug use](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/bv8ike/i_27f_dumped_my_boyfriend_27m_for_using_cocaine/), but wanting to hopefully start seeing him again as he started seeking a more sober and healthy lifestyle. One struggle was his friends pretty actively painting me as controlling, and someone who doesn't love him for who he is. I was also very worried about the ease of getting away from that lifestyle.

&amp;#x200B;

I've been amazed at the continued push-back from his friends. They had a ""guys weekend"" last weekend where they'd purchased quite a lot of cocaine, plus other misc drugs (adderall, vyvanse, LSD...) He originally had been tasked with the buy for the weekend, but ultimately opted not to go. I was going camping with my friends and told him he was welcome to come along. I told him I trusted him to go, but he chose not to go with his friends. Of course, this led to his friends calling me being controlling, and that I am changing him to meet my own interests. One of his close friends in particular has been a huge instigator in creating as much conflict as possible around this... namely attacking me on twitter, and having him removed from their friend group chats for picking a girl over friends.

&amp;#x200B;

It's really hard for me to understand all of it and why a select few of his friends have so much opposition to this. I guess I don't see drugs as a personality trait so much as a lifestyle choice, but in their minds, i'm alone in that. I fear this sounding judgmental, but the friends with the firmest oppositions are two dudes who are 29, deliver pizzas, and spend 99% of their time high, at raves and other events like that. 

&amp;#x200B;

We've been back seeing eachother for 6 weeks now; he's been essentially sober with the exception of a beer here or there. He's been joining me at yoga, we've been doing stuff outdoors like rollerblading, riding bikes, cooking out together, etc and he said he feels a lot more level. I can tell he's bummed feeling ostracized from his friends, but i've repeatedly told him I trust him and will support whatever decisions he makes, even if it means us not being together - just that I expect honesty.

&amp;#x200B;

It's taken me a few weeks to let go of caring what his friends think about me, but I know my intentions are good. Still sucks feeling hated, but I'm not really sure what else I can do.

&amp;#x200B;

I really appreciated the advice and sort of reality-slap that those people are largely toxic. There was a lot of really good wisdom that helped me come to the realization that it's not worth my energy to care what they have to say. 

&amp;#x200B;

Tl;Dr - updating: I'm not regretting seeing my bf who i dumped for cocaine use after he decided to stop using. His friends hate me, but I don't really care."
6,"My parents [50s] are pressuring me [20F] to have my brother [15M] at my wedding.


This whole mess started in April, when I ordered my wedding dress. My mother had been pretty dodgy about helping me out with my wedding. Lots of empty promises and I figured that since I had the money, I should pay for my own dress.  

This absolutely pissed my mother off because she believed that it was wrong of me to pay for my own dress. Who did she think was at fault? My fiance, who had been saving up money for our future. Since he had money, she believed that he was responsible for all my expenses that she had promised to pay for (my mother has a long history of blaming others before herself). I was upset because I believed that I was in a comfortable financial situation to pay for it, and didn't want my fiance to sacrifice his savings for the sake of my mothers pride.

I wasn't fully aware of how upset she was since this was all over text; until my fiance sent me screenshots of horrible things my brother was saying to him. Saying he wasn't a man, that I was an idiot for being with him, that I was welcome to come home when I decided to leave him. When I saw this I immediately drove to my parents house to confront him.

One screaming match later and I told my mother he wasn't allowed at my wedding if he had those views. I was so mad that my mother had involved him and twisted his head so much that he would try and sabotage my relationship. This isn't the first time my brother has gone off on one of his sisters' partners, and he's never had to apologize for it before.

A few months later and they are reminded that he isn't coming to my wedding in September, and they are angry. Saying it's wrong for him not to come. I told them it was disrespectful to my relationship to have him there. In the few months since our altercation, he hasn't apologized, and he's also cursed out my sister and her boyfriend in the same manner over a different issue.

Even if he did apologize, I don't believe it would be genuine in the slightest. My brother has gone his whole life without apologizing to any of his sisters. My parents refuse to punish him for anything, and now that he's older he has no fear of authority. To have him at my wedding is just another way both he and my parents get to walk over me.

TL;DR - My brother was extremely disrespectful to my fiance and now my parents expect him to be at the wedding despite his lack of remorse."
7,"My boyfriend (28M) thinks I'm (29F) unmotivated because I don't have a ""dream job""


TL;DR: My boyfriend thinks I need to find my ""dream job"", and claims that I'm unmotivated because I haven't. Now I'm worried he would end the relationship over it. 

I'm a software engineer at a mid-sized biotech company. I get paid well, have a fairly good work-life balance (unusual for this industry) and I don't actively hate it. However, it's not my ""dream job"". It can be stressful at times and it doesn't inspire me. The work I do is impressive, but it doesn't feel meaningful. If I won the lottery, I would quit my job today and never work again. 

My boyfriend is the polar opposite. He is a physical therapist and he absolutely loves his job. He feels every day like he's making a direct difference in people's lives and he loves talking about his work all of the time. He says even if he won the lottery he wouldn't stop working because he loves it too much. 

I'm super proud of him and glad that he's doing what he loves, but he thinks that I need to be in the same place. I told him that not everyone can be lucky enough to find their dream job, and some people just work to make money and enjoy their free time. He keeps pushing me to change careers, and claims that I'm unmotivated and making excuses for myself. However, I'm hesitant to leave a stable and good paying job to find my ""dream job"" when I dont even know what that looks like! It seems like he would rather be with someone who is ""motivated"" and either at or working towards their dream job. 

Is it okay to just work to live instead of living to work?"
8,"My (34F) husband (37M) is leaving me and our 2 month old because he doesn't want kids anymore.


My emotions have been all over the place and now I'm simply numb.

We've been married for 4 years and always had a great relationship with open communication. We started talking about having kids before we got married - a conversation he actually brought up initially. We were both in agreement that we eventually wanted kids, and I always thought he would be a great dad. He's excellent with my niece and nephew, very loving and caring and they are always happy to see him. He always buys gifts for them and spoils them. We were both so excited to start a family of our own.

We got pregnant last July and gave birth to our daughter in March. He was a completely different person right after I gave birth. At first I thought it was because of the big life event and change, which is completely to be expected. I noticed he didn't want to hold our daughter for the first few days, something about not wanting to get her sick. He hasn't wanted to take any family pictures either.

Yesterday, I ran into a coworker of his  that I hadn't seen in a while I was at the grocery store. She saw our daughter and asked who I was babysitting for. I was surprised by the question, and told her she was my daughter. His coworker had no idea I was even pregnant.

I confronted him when I get home and we got into an argument that ended in him spilling everything. He never wanted kids, he only said he did because he felt like I did. He thought he would learn to love our daughter but he just feels nothing. The argument ended with him breaking up with me and spending the night in a hotel, leaving me and our daughter all alone. Today, I woke up to a text that he was leaving the country. I'm just shocked. I don't know what to do anymore. I'm shaking as I type this.

Tldr: my husband of 4 years left me and our 2 month old because he says he never wanted kids and can't imagine a life with a child"
9,"I [23F] bought my friend's [24M] music and he found out, now he's hurt


My best friend has been producing music for years, he's on a pretty high level production-wise for an amateur and is slowly gaining a following online. I genuinely like his music, it's in a Genre we both like a lot, and I always give my honest feedback about his newest tracks, which is usually pretty positive. He tends to be very self-critical but which artist isn't.

&amp;#x200B;

So basically he set up a bandcamp account recently where people can download his music and can pay whatever they want for it. After a while, I had this idea that I want to buy his album so he feels better about his music, and also kinda because he doesn't have a lot of money. I paid about twice what you'd normally pay for a brand new music album which is absolutely no big deal for me financially.

&amp;#x200B;

Well.. next time we saw each other he excitedly told me that someone paid for his album and by that point I had almost forgotten and just kinda went 'oh yeah oh shit' internally and tried to act nonchalant but I guess I failed. It must have been on my face because he immediately asked if it was me and I didn't want to lie in his face so I said yes. Now he's hurt because he thought this random stranger liked his music so much they paid a lot for it, and a friend doesn't count I guess. I totally understand his emotional reaction. I'm a genuine fan and only wanted to support him, but basically he doesn't want alms. 

&amp;#x200B;

He didn't really get mad over it, but I could tell from his face that it actually hurt him a lot and now I feel awkward about it. Should I just never mention it again, or apologize in detail or something?

&amp;#x200B;

\---

&amp;#x200B;

\*\*tl,dr:\*\* Friend thought a new fan had bought his music, but it was me. He feels like I only did it because we're friends and is hurt. What do I do?"
10,"I [27M] don’t know how to deal with my ex [30F]


We’ve been living together for 4 years and broke up 3-4 months ago. 

She decided to end things, but at the same time she still wants me in her life. It’s a weird situation. We still text each other daily and I basically see her once every week.

I know that she’s not telling me everything about her personal life and this creates uncomfortable situations (I couldn’t help but notice that she keeps her phone switched off every time she’s with me).

She doesn’t want to stay with me, but she can’t imagine her life without me. A few days ago I switched off my phone and didn’t reply to her for almost a day, and she went crazy. She sent me countless of messages/emails and tried to call me.

When I started to reply again, she told me to please not abandon her.

Since I’ve been traveling for the last 3+ weeks, yesterday night she wrote me a text, saying “I miss you. Let me know when you’re back”. Then she wrote me again, saying “I miss you... Good night.”

I don’t know what to do. I don’t want to cut contacts with her entirely, but at the same time I feel like I can’t go on with my life. Also, she keeps my hopes alive by saying these things.

I also don’t get why she’s so attached to me when she’s the one who decided to end things.

Any advice?

TL;DR: Recently broke up with my GF of 4 years. She doesn’t want to stay with me, but she wants me in her life."
11,"My sister [35 F] is a servant and unhappy in her arranged marriage [35M] and I [33F] don't know how to help


Disclaimer: I personally don't want an arranged marriage, so if you don't think it's a good idea, you don't have to convince me. I don't judge people who have one, though. About half my relatives and a few of my Indian friends have one. It's just my personal preference.

That being said, thanks in advance for any advice. 

My sister, raised in America since age 2, got an arranged marriage at age 23 to a doctor from India. He moved here after the marriage. Pretty soon after, her in-laws moved into her 2 bedroom apartment. This is the tradition, for the husband's parents to move in after marriage, but a lot of Indian don't do this. Some do, though. Maybe half and half.

She worked while he was in residency and while she had two boys, and now she is a stay at home mom. While she worked and had kids, she still had to make full Indian dinner every night and chai in the morning.

She is basically a servant in her own house. She cooks and cleans for her family of 5. Whenever she makes a special dinner, like Punjabi food or Italian, she also has to cook for her sister-in-law's family of 4. 

Her mother in law doesn't lift a finger to help. She watches TV, naps or talks on the phone all day. She watches the kids, but doesn't make them meals. She leaves that to my sister. She doesn't take the kids to the park or on walks. She doesn't supervise their homework.

If my sister wants to go out to have lunch with her husband, she has has to lie about it. She says she has a ""doctor's appt"". I know this because my BIL told me. He thinks it's funny that they have to lie. This is because the mother in law will want to come. She doesn't have friends, either. Even if she did, I don't know how she would go out when she has so much work to do at home. Her in-laws come along on vacations. 

I told her that now that BIL is a full doctor, they can afford to get a maid to come by once a week or month. She said that would never work. 

Important info: In Indian culture, the husband's mom is basically a queen and the wife is supposed to serve her and her father in law, but these days and even in my mother's generation, this is often no longer done. I don't know a single other Indian family where the MIL abuses the old traditions in this way and refuses to lift a finger. 

For example, my grandma lived with us, and she would start dinner when my mom was at work. She would eat leftovers or make lunch when my mom was at work or busy. She would wash dishes even when my mom begged her to stop and sit down.  My sister has to make a new lunch every day and clean by herself. My grandma also took us to the park, walks, and supervised homework or playtime.  

What can I do to help? Anything? I understand that her husband should help my sister and tell his parents that my sister needs help, but I don't think he will, since he's not dumb, sees it, and hasn't talked to his mother yet. He is a huge Mama's boy.

This is also affecting my relationship with her. She is not nice to me and insults me often, even though I treat her and her family with respect and am hands on with her kids. I shower them with love and attention. I take them on outings to give her a break when I'm in town, 3-4 times a year. When I'm in town, I watch them while she leaves the house to spend time by herself. I think she is unhappy and resents the freedom I have in my life. 

TLDR: my sister is a maid and servant and seems unhappy in her marriage. Can I do anything to help?"
12,"HELP, I broke with my GF.


 

I \[28m\] broke up with my girlfriend \[28f\] after 2 years of dating and she LOST it . She has stopped eating , and I'm afraid she is going to need medical attention . The breakup happened after 1 month of trying to break up with her.

Last time I tried to break up with her she took my keys and wouldn't let me go. She cried and begged and refused to leave my house , when she left she drove recklessly and dangerously. She has a history of anxiety anti-psychotic medication and depression and extreme neediness and obsessive tendencies..

When I finally broke up up with her she wouldn't accept it . I explained over and over and over the reasons why and she wouldn't take it . When she finally left then her mom started calling me begging me to rethink my decision, then they both started calling me repeatedly and I refused to answer the calls and blocked them both.... then they started repeatedly ( harassment ) calling my mom. It's insane.

I don't answer my phone they ring my home phone. If I don't answer my home phone they ring my mom , and if my mom doesn't answer she comes to my house.

TLDR; I break up with GF after a long time of trying to bridge our differences. She starts acting irrationally and I am stressed the fuck out with all this chaos . 

&amp;#x200B;

What do I do?"
13,"My neighbors (middle age) keep calling the police on us (21f 22f 23f 22f) but we haven't done anything illegal



I live with my friends Abby, Chloe, and Melissa, we're renting a house in a residential area that's mostly full of home owners with families. Which I guess has ruffled some feathers?

Anyway, several of our neighbors have called the cops on us for super petty things. 

One time, the neighbors to our right called us in for having an undrivable junker car in our yard. The car was actually my car, which is a bit old and beaten up but drives just fine, I have it registered and insured and all by the books, and I drive it everyday to work.

Another time, we'd gotten a bonfire pit for our yard from Craiglist and decided to have some friends over for a bonfire and hot dogs and smores. The law says that you can have a contained fire as long as it is for cooking purposes.

Our neighbors to the left called the police about an illegal fire. The cops came over and we showed them that we had all out hot dogs and marshmallows out to eat, and that our fire pit was the proper distance from any structures.

Apparently one neighbor called in a complaint about the smell of weed and none of us smoke weed, we did have a friend over who's vaping to quit cigs so maybe they took that and ran with it??

We've had noise complaints called in, claiming parties, at totally unreasonable times. Like only one of us is home, and is just hanging out doing chores listening to music at a normal level, for example. And the cops show up and see that there's no party, just one girl doing the dishes in her pajamas. Or just a couple of us home, each hanging out with our boyfriends.

The last straw was when my roommates and I took an Uber home so we wouldn't drive drunk, and one of our neighbors called the cops to say we were driving drunk. And that she'd seen one of our cars pull into the driveway and four drink girls come out and one even pukes into the bushes. But none of us were driving, and we had Uber history to show it. 

It's driving us mad, and it's not just one neighbor doing it, it's three families who have made these petty complaints. 

We haven't tried to talk to them because they seem cray, but maybe we could resolve things if we did? Can we have some help with how to get them to lay off?

tl;dr - neighbors keep calling the cops for petty reasons"
14,"I (24F) don't know what to talk about with my boyfriend (22M)


These days I usually don't know what topic to talk about with my boyfriend, except for near future plans and what happened during the day, as if I'm doing some sort of detective investigation on him. 

I wish we shared a mutual hobby or interest to discuss about, but we don't really have one. I tried to ask him to do something together like joining a club or playing some sport but he's not interested. When hanging out we often watch movies together, but we normally don't really talk about them, we just... watch. 

It's not like he doesn't love me anymore. He still cares about me and does little nice things for me. He simply does not seem to mind this issue at all. I could try to ignore it too, but then it hurts a little when I see him engage in long conversations with someone else, especially about stuffs that I know nothing about or can't understand. It sounds dumb when I keep asking and he's tired of explaining things to me... 

I don't know if I'm worrying too much. Is this something that is supposed to be dealt with by both of us, not just me? or is it not really an issue to begin with, that I'm overthinking and everyone in a relationship is like that? I just want us to connect a bit better...

*TL;DR: my boyfriend and I don't have a lot of things in common. I'm concerned that I often don't know what to talk to him about. Is this a bad thing or actually normal in relationships?"
15,"My boyfriend's (24m) ex (25f) and I (24f) unwittingly became good friends. The truth just came out



I told Eric on the phone that Kate from the gym was his college ex Kate, and neither of us had any idea till today. And that we hoped it would not be awkward.

And he didn't take that well, he told me that it was crazy that I would want to keep being friends with her. And that she had treated him worse than I knew, she was very hot and cold, having a crazy whirlwind romance with him at first and then going cold and dumping him for no reason soon after. And that since I'd never wanted to talk about it, I didn't ever know what a selfish and uncaring person she was.

I also admit I had some hurt feelings... Remember how I said Kate and I were like twins. Same career, same style, similar looks, similar personality... I had this weird gut feeling that Eric had gotten with me because her wasn't over Kate, and wanted to find a ""Kate 2.0"" to replace her, rather than falling for me as my own person. Maybe that's crazy but the similarities between us are honestly a little uncanny. I haven't told Eric about this thought yet, but it's been dwelling in the back of my mind.

I don't want to lose Kate as a friend but I don't know how to balance our new friendship with my relationship now.

tldr - I unwittingly became good friends with my boyfriend's ex."
16,"How can I [33 M] learn to be more patient of my one-year partner's [33 F] backseat driving?


**TLDR:** I have a great relationship with my girlfriend almost all of the time, except when I'm driving and she's constantly backseat driving which is slowly driving me nuts, eventually making me snap. We've talked about it, but it keeps happening and since I think she'll always do it to some extent, **how can I learn to be more patient with it?**

Long story: My girlfriend will constantly tell me what is happening and/or what to do on the road while I drive, at the same time that I've seen it and that I plan on acting on it. 

For example, the exact second that the light turns green, she will tell me that the light is green. The second there is a car in front of me slowing down to turn left, she will tell me to go to the right lane, because the car in front of me is turning left. And so on. She is telling me these things just as I'm about to react to things that I've already seen myself and was planning on doing safely (for example: I will NOT switch lane without first checking my blind spot for incoming cars/cyclists and turning my signal).

Her comments are not a regarding safety issues like missing a stop sign, they're just routine comments on driving and it's constantly interrupting the flow of conversation. 

I genuinely do think I'm a good driver - no accidents no tickets, no close-calls, and I'm not getting honked, so I don't think it's my driving at issue. I've talked about it with her - she does think I'm a good driver, but she says she comments while I drive because she's ""*trying to be helpful*"". Except it doesn't help me, it just stresses me out. She has her own car too, and when she drives, I virtually never comment on her driving, so it's not reciprocal. 

I've tried to stay receptive and accept it, but eventually I've snapped, and it's putting a stain on the relationship. Example:

Me: *[Telling random story about what happened the last few days.]* 

Her: Left on the next street.

Me: Thank you.

Her: You can turn right on red.

Me: Yup, thanks.

Her: The lanes are merging.

Me: I know.

Her: There are two lanes again.

Me: Yup!

Her: Light's green.

Me: Thanks.

Her: Go to the right lane!

Me: I can go straight on this lane. 

Her: But the car in front is turning left!

Me: I know it's turning left, *can I please focus on my driving??*

Her: I *WANT*  you to focus on driving!

Me: Why don't you just let me drive - I didn't need to switch to the right lane, and was going to do so anyways, when it was safe because I was making sure that the cyclists we just passed weren't taking the whole right lane, that's all!

Her: Why are you snapping at me, I'm just trying to be helpful!!

Me: I'm not snapping at you, I'm just explaining why I did not switch the the right lane at the exact second. 

Her: Then why is your voice pitch elevated? 

Me: Okay so you're not interested in the story I was saying, that's fine. Just let me drive. Thanks. 

Her: *silence treatment for several minutes*. 

Me: What's wrong? 

Her: We'll talk about it when I get home. 

And then at home of course the only problem is that I ""snapped"" when she was trying to be ""helpful"", and that I'm making such a big deal of her trying to be helpful and not appreciating it. I said I'm sorry for snapping, and asked her to please wait two seconds when she has helpful ""advice"" for me on the road before actually giving me the advice so that I actually have time to react before hearing her advice - but it keeps happening. Ultimately, I also need to be more patient about receiving unsolicited advice and comments on my driving. 

Do you have advice, Reddit? How can I become more patient? Or do you have any other suggestions? 

Thank you!"
17,"My (F36) husband (M40) of 20 years is going on a men’s trip with some of his friends and he said there’s a 1% chance that he could sleep with someone else, how can I make him understand why that has hurt/effected me so much?


He told me that he “just wanted to put it out there so there’s a buffer in case it happens” although it’s “highly unlikely that it will because he’s not that kind of guy”. 

I tried explaining to him that 1% is still huge, and is causing me to doubt his commitment to me if he thinks it could actually happen. I don’t know what to say to him to make him understand why it has effected me so much and why I am now questioning whether he should go on the ‘men’s trip’.  

I’ve never been opposed to the trip before, I’ve never told him he can’t go out or hang out with his friends or anything, but now I don’t want him to go, because I know that the entire time he is gone I will be stressing out about whether he’s slept/sleeping with someone.

We have an amazing relationship and I’ve never doubted his commitment or love for me before. We have a very active and satisfying sex life and I’ve always been open to experimenting and trying new things, so there’s no reason he could be bored.

All his friends are also married long term and he’s never slept with anyone else before. 

TL;DR Husband says there’s a 1% chance he could be unfaithful to me which has really upset me and made me doubt his commitment to me."
18,"My [30M] wife’s [29F] view on gender roles in relationships has me sick to my stomach, and causing deep resentment. Need advice.


Im 30 and my wife is 29F. We’ve been together for nearly a decade now. Since I can remember, she has always been type of woman who identifies with the old adage, “The woman/wife is always right.” Like men should want to cater to his woman’s every want and need. She was raised with this mentality, as her mother is the same way, and her father caters to her mother’s wants and needs. In the beginning, this mentality was sorta cute, and maybe even endearing? But as time went on, it has become pure resentment on my end. She will expect me to cater to her beck and call. If she needs something in the middle of the night for a project, I am to run to the store for her. If she needs a last minute errand, she will send me. If she forgets something, I’m supposed to go retrieve it for her. If she needs something that is not within arm’s reach, she sends me.. She often jokes about it, and says that I need to be a “gentleman,” and do it for her. It’s not funny anymore, and its causing serious problems for us. If I refuse to do what she asks, I get the silent treatment, and the “Fine, I’ll do it myself” thing, that is followed by passive aggressiveness for days. 

The really SHITTY part is that I can never rely on her for anything at all. She will flat out refuse to do small favors, and tasks that I need. It’s like she forgets all the stuff I do for her, or she just feels heavily entitled to everything that I do for her, and feels that she doesn’t need to reciprocate because she’s a woman..I have brought this up to her MANY times over the years, but she just doesn’t see it. We’ve had several discussion, both calm, and heated over this very topic. It drives me crazy, because I can’t tell if she’s gaslighting me, or if she honestly doesn’t see her own behavior? Every time we talk about it, she can never tell me why she thinks this double standard is okay... is it okay? Is it normal for the guy to cater to his wife, while she doesn’t need to reciprocate? 

It’s gotten to the point where I WONT want to do any favors for her. I feel a deep resentment when she asks me to do things for her, because I KNOW that if the roles were reversed, she would NOT do the same for me. She’s proven this to me time and time again. 

Today we got into a big fight over her wanting me to take photos of her for her Instagram, and I got so upset. It’s obviously not about taking the photos, but more so about all of this resentment I have over the double standards. 

TLDR: Wife has double standards in our marriage and refuses to acknowledge that things need to change, or that there’s even a problem in the first place."
19,"My [23f] boyfriend's [25m] dad [oldm] has started hanging out at the club where I dance. This feels really weird and I don't know what to do.


I'm a dancer. Okay....I'm a stripper. There.

I've been seeing my boy for three months. He is super sweet and fun to be around, hes very respectful of me and doesn't mind my current job, and I think we have a good future ahead of us.

About a month ago I met his family. His parents are divorced so I met mom and dad seperately. When we first met his mom I asked him what I should say if she asks what I do, and bf's answer was basically ""Tell her whatever you want, I'm not worried."".

I figured it would be best to just be straightforward and get it out of the way, so when mom asked, I told her. She seemed a little surprised but got over it quick and was perfectly fine and friendly.

A couple weeks after that I met his dad. Bf and dad have a pretty strained relationship, and the only reason we went over is for his brothers graduation party. The subject of what I do came up, and I figured just to say it again since it went well with mom.

Dad was less cool about it. He made a couple minor comments and mostly avoided me until we left. When I told bf what happened he apologized and just said his dads opinion on anything doesn't concern him much.

That was all fine and dandy, until a couple weeks after I was at work and spotted.....dad. In the club. I'm pretty good at seperating work and regular life but that hit a little too close to home so I tried to avoid him the rest of the night. I'm not sure if he saw me or not. I know he got a dance and the girls mentioned he was a bad tipper. Not sure if relevant but it didn't help my opinion of him. And I don't know if he deliberately came to mine, somehow figuring out where I work, or if it was a fluke?

I saw him again a week after that. We locked eyes at one point and it seemed like he was watching all night, but he never said anything. Same story, got a dance or two, tipped poorly, and left.

Then this weekend he came in for a third time. He still hasn't talked to me, still tips bad from what I heard, still seemed to follow me with his eyes all night.

I'm weirded out. I've had my share of creepy old dudes but this is too close to home for me. And everything I hear about the guy tells me he is not the type to go to a club, or respect anyone who does, so why is he suddenly hanging out here.

And I haven't told the boyfriend because I have a policy of not saying a word about it if I happen to see someone I know in the club, but maybe I should? I'm not sure how he'd take it, boyfriend really doesn't like his dad much, and I kinda see why.

What to do? Say something to boyfriend or let it ride and continue to avoid him? I like the club I work at because they've always done a pretty good job of keeping an atmosphere where the girls can be pretty comfortable, and I don't like that it is getting ruined. Because this makes me not comfortable. Help?!?

**TL;DR** Boyfriends dad started hanging out at the club I work in and seems to stare at me the whole time. It creeps me out. What should I do?"
20,"My (27F) boyfriend (29M) says I have to ""pay off"" the time he spent commuting.


When my boyfriend and I first moved in together after 3 years of a LDR, our job situation was not ideal. We worked in cities far from each other with almost no rental options that would allow us to split the commute. We ended up in a place where he had an 1 hr 15 min commute each way and mine was 25 min each way. Because of this difference I agreed that I would wash all the household dishes (his least favorite chore, we had no dishwasher). During this time, I also agreed that I would drive on our trips together to visit family, vacations, and trips into town a couple times a week. 

The plan from the beginning was that he would find a new job in the same city I worked in and we would move. This living and commuting situation was meant to be temporary. However, as time went on it became obvious we'd be there a lot longer. He never looked at jobs and when I'd suggest jobs, he'd ignore them, say he liked his current position more, or even blame me for not helping him apply. He didn't apply for a single job during the 3 years we were there. At that point, I actually got a job in the city he worked in and we were able to move there and now each have 5 min commutes, which is amazing. 

The problem I have is now even after things are more settled, I am still stuck driving the car on all our trips. He argues that I have to ""pay off"" all the time he spent commuting, which adds up to thousands of hours. I feel like I put in my part of the deal from the beginning and while I was always grateful he was willing to commute (I would never have survived it) there is something that feels skeezy to me about being ""indebted"" to him for years after.

What do you think? Should I suck it up and put in the time or is this as unfair as I feel it is?

TL;DR Boyfriend is changing original terms of our commuting deal as he must feel I got off easy. Am I being taken advantage of?"
21,"My [M24] SO [F26] has put on nearly 50lbs in the last 3 years. She hates herself and I have no idea what else to do.


My girlfriend and I have lived together for 3 years and, and in that time she's put on 40 pounds, and has cried every step of the way. 
I've watched her cry at her first 5
Then her first 10, then at the next 10, and so on.

Every step of the way, she's bawled her eyes out about how she can't seem to lose any weight. How much she hates her body, how none of her clothes fit her anymore, how gross she feels all the time, these are all things I've heard her talk about to no end. At every 10 pound milestone, she swears that's the turning point, and she's not going to let herself get heavier.

But here we are, almost 50 pounds up in 3 years, and i don't know what to even say anymore.

Myself, I do work out, not a lot, just enough to stay healthy, though I used to be obsessed with it. I've managed to stay about the same weight I've been since we've lived together, i fluctuate a little, but I'm only human. I'm a firm believer in CICO, having seen the results myself, and that's how I've managed to keep myself together.

At this point, I've tried everything. I tell her all the stuff I see on r/loseit, we found a fitness YouTuber we both like, and watched the transformations he's helped people make. I make it a point to keep our dinners healthy, and low calorie. we don't always have time for solid breakfasts, so I make her oatmeal (her idea) for breakfast since she says it holds her over. I used to prep meals and she would leave them in the fridge, so that stopped. When we don't have dinner together (because I'm out of town or she is), she orders sushi, and God only knows what she eats for lunch at work because she's not straightforward with that ever. I've tried being the personal trainer, but that was just unhealthy for our relationship. 

She's adamant that she's just not getting enough cardio, and that she just has to talk to a nutritionist. Whatever. I'm exhausted, and what's worse is that I can't even share  my victories with her. I'm working on losing another 10 pounds, but I can't even tell her about my progress because she responds with how much she's lost. I think that's why I stopped working out as much as I used to.

Today I watched her hold back tears as she cut herself out of her pants with a pair of meat scissors. Im watching the woman I love grow to hate herself more and more each day while doing nothing about it. And now, I'm out of things to even say to her to encourage her. That's all I want to know now. I'm out of things I can do.

What can I say to her? What on Earth can help?

Tl;dr, my girlfriend of 6 years has put on nearly 50 pounds over 3 years of living together. I feel completely unable to help, and it's only getting worse. I'm at a loss, what can I do?"
22,"My girlfriend (25f) has a really eccentric apartment and I'm (30m) more traditional. How do we move in together and compromise?


My girlfriend, after getting her first apartment alone, just went wild with making it her own, whatever she'd dreamed of having in it. She's gotten a lofted bed (a bed on stilts) with a blanket fort underneath with a bunch of bean bag chairs and oversized pillows inside. When she had her friends over, this is where they usually hang out. It's really the only place in the apartment that's half decent for hosting people. It's kind of annoying having to climb a ladder into bed for me.

She's got a small balcony outside her bedroom, and she's absolutely filled it with plants so that there's no room to sit out there or anything. Lots of wildflowers planted from seed in whatever containers she had lying around. I wish she'd saved some room because it would be a nice place to sit.

All the screens in the windows have been removed so she can get out onto the section of roof below them, and hang out and read and watch the sunsets there. Because her balcony is full of plants, I guess. But flies and spiders are always coming in.

She's got a room that's supposed to be a living room, but she's gotten it set up for her hobbies instead (mainly tinkering with electronics, doing projects with Arduino and stuff, diy home automation stuff). So she's just got a huge workbench in the room with a single stool, and a bunch of toolboxes and containers of parts for stuff, wires, tools, etc. Apparently she can get some parts she needs cheaper from used or broken kids toys with motors and sensors and whatever, so there are always torn up RC cars and stuff laying around.

 She studied computer engineering in school so lots of what she's doing is way beyond me. Her home automation stuff doesn't always work consistently, it it honestly very cool when it works but sometimes I just want the damn lights to work right. I don't want basic stuff in an apartment to fail because of a software bug or a broken motor.

Her kitchen has a sofa and bookshelf, that would usually go in the living room, and she also has a tiny dining table set up in there. It's really cramped.

I don't hate everything about her apartment, it can be kind of fun and unique. But since we've been talking about moving in together, it seems like we'll have a hard time compromising. 

I really want a place where we can host people and have friends over without it being weird and inconvenient. So that means a living room with chairs and a sofa and tv, a kitchen that works as a kitchen, perhaps a dining room. I'd want a place to sit and work from home sometimes. I'd want a bedroom that's got a normal bed, and that we don't bring our friends into to hang out.

And she wants a hobby shop, a place to keep all her plants, she wants to keep her heaps of beanbag chairs and pillows for hosting guests. She wants to be able to set up her diy gadgets to control stuff in the apartment. And she's fine with displacing some of the more ""normal"" rooms in an apartment to make room for this stuff. 

We honestly can't afford a place big enough to have all this. A normal living room, kitchen, dining room, a hobby room, a gardening area, a beanbag pile area that's out of the bedroom, etc.

So, how can we meet in the middle? I don't want to take her hobbies assessment from her, but I wish she could figure out a way to not let all this take over a home. 

tldr - Trying to figure out how to move in together with my girlfriend. She's eccentric and I want more of a traditional home."
23,"I (17F) hate my mother (45F) because of how she treated me growing up. Am I being too harsh?


Throwaway account I’m kind of embarrassed to post on my main. I really dislike her I don’t know if hate is too strong. Growing up she was not a good parent, I was obese as a kid, she would constantly make fun of me, call me disgusting, say that she was ashamed of me, that I was an obese piece of shit, that she wished that she had a normal daughter. She would always point out normal sized girls in public and tell me that’s what I should look like. Why would you say that to an 8 year old? She made me feel so ugly and as if I wasn’t good enough for my own mother. She would always say that I’m going to die before she does and that no man would ever want to date me. She said she didn’t love me either because of how I was fat. I know I could have had it a lot worse. I have now lost weight which took me quite a long time, I’ve gone down from 100kgs to 75. The thing that really hurts me is that she now says that she loves me and that she is proud of me. I’m still the same person as I was 25kgs heavier. So why a change all of a sudden? She also cheated on my dad multiple times, I’d be in my room and men would come over while my dad was at work. Her reasoning is because he wasn’t affectionate enough. I found videos of her on the computer having sex with men when I was about 9 and honestly it was so disgusting to see. Also her nudes where everywhere on the computer and she didn’t even care at all. She also accuses me of doing sexual stuff with my brother which is so disgusting I would never do something like that. She still has the audacity to say she was a good mum and that she worked so hard for me and my brother. When my whole life she would be in bed sleeping mostly everyday while my dad was at work paying the bills. She has not once apologised. So now everything she does makes me so angry, even when she just wants to have a normal conversation with me I just want to punch her in the face, I want her out of my life when I’m older, she means nothing to me and has ruined a chance of a mother daughter relationship. Am I being too harsh? Do I even have a right to not like her? Am I being a bitch if I don’t contact her when I’m older? 

TLDR; I hate my mother because of how she would treat me growing up, am I being unreasonable?"
24,"I (24f) want to buy my parents a car, my boyfriend (29m) is angry I'm spending so much on them when I'm generally frugal around him




My parents did a lot for me, especially during college. They are not well off, my dad works a blue collar job, he didn't go to college, and my mom has health issues and hasn't been able to work for a while. Her treatment is expensive too. They did without a lot to get me to college, skimping on other stuff so I wouldn't have to take out loans. They've seen how bad debt can screw up a life and they wanted me to get my education debt free.

I went for a CS degree, and graduated 3 years ago. I am so grateful for that, I know my dad has to retire later in life because of that. 

I got a really well paying job and have 40k saved in my 401k already, plus 40k in a savings account. I've been living frugally because I want to set myself up for later in life. Plus I've wanted to be able to care for my parents like they did for me.

My boyfriend has been a little frustrated with my frugal living (staying in a small studio apartment, not wanting to go out to eat much, wanting to go out to the dive bar for drinks and partying rather than somewhere nicer, wanting to camp when traveling rather than getting a hotel, etc.) 

I think he's just like that because he's never known financial worry and doesn't have the same priorities as I do. I'm more conservative with my money because I wanna always be comfortable and safe, he values more fun and a nicer living space 

----

Just this week, my parents car broke down and the fix would cost more than the car is worth. They've been keeping the thing limping on for so long anyway that I'm surprised it lasted this long. 

They really rely on having a car because they live somewhere rural. My dad has been riding his bicycle to work this week and I'm worried about him because the roads he rides on don't have a lot of cyclists, and people drive fast. Plus it's a long way and that's hard on him physically.

My parents are looking for a car that cost about 3k, but I'm worried that will be another junker that won't last.

So I want to spend 10-15k on a gently used and reliable car for them. That's easily in my budget, I could pay cash upfront for the car and still not have any financial worry.

So I asked my boyfriend if he'd help me go to some dealerships and pick out a car for my parents. I know some about cars but I could use another opinion because he knows more.

And he got upset when I told him my budget, saying stuff like ""you won't even spend 200 on a weekend trip with me, but you'll drop 15 thousand in a car???? For your parents who I know wouldn't ever ask that of you?""

I told him how important caring for my parents was to me, and he accused me of ""just being cheap when it comes to him"" which upset me. I owe my parents a lot for putting me through college at their own expense. It's different.

So I still plan on getting the car for my parents but I know it's going to be a huge bone to pick in my relationship. How should I work through this?

tldr - I plan on buying my parents a car, my boyfriend is upset"
25,"I (30M) have been putting off breaking up with my gf (27F) of ~4 months because she's been studying for an exam. Her exam is this Saturday - how do I let her down easy?


tl;dr - Decided to break up weeks ago due to differences in values, but held off due to not wanting to mess up her studying. Gf finishes exam on Saturday, but it seems cruel to break up with her while she's exhausted, but disingenuous to wait. How do I let her down easy?

 

Late last year I met my now gf on a dating app; things kind of went on hold as I went away for the Christmas holiday, but we progressed eventually and decided to go exclusive this past February.

Things since then have been... fine. She a good person and hasn't done anything wrong, but I just don't see her as a potential life partner. While we share hobbies and have good daily chemistry, we have a few differences in beliefs and values, and our different backgrounds / upbringings create conflicts in expectations. While she doesn't feel these are deal breakers, I'm not sure I can live with them. Additionally, I'm currently searching for a new job (am getting burnt-out in my current one) and have a few leads in different cities. There is a very good chance I end up moving in the next few months.

Anyhow, I decided I wanted to break up with her nearly three weeks ago. I've just been putting it off because she has a big exam with a reasonably high fail-rate that will complete her designation on Saturday and I didn't want to de-rail her studying.

I haven't seen her in a couple of weeks (to give her space to study) and have minimized our texting. Our current plan is for me to pick her up after the exam and bring her to my place. I was going to make her favorite foods for dinner as a sort of celebration for finishing the exam. But now, this all just feels very awkward.

She'll just have finished an exam and be exhausted. On the one hand, it feels just cruel to immediately break up with her right after. On the other hand, it also feels super disingenuous to give her a ""hooray, you're done!"" night and then break up with her in the morning.

I don't hate her, I just don't feel we're right for each other and don't want to waste anyone's time. How do I let her down as easily as possible?"
26,"Please help me(29f) write an appropriate letter to my father (63m) letting him know how I felt this weekend after he flashed his lifestyle, while trying to reconnect.


TLDR: Basically I haven’t seen my dad in 7 years and after this recent trip I have decided that I don’t want to have contact with him anymore. Not only do I want to cut contact, I want to get my feeling off my chest. I know the effort is futile but it’s more of a healing method for me. He flashed his lifestyle and bragged about being a good father. It would mean a lot to me if y’all kind people of relationships could review my letter and give me some direction. I don’t feel comfortable opening to to friends of family about my feelings but I do without a doubt what to write a letter to my father. Thank you! 

Letter: Dad, although it feels weird calling you that after a lifetime apart. After this weekend, I can’t explain to you how much joy I experienced reconnecting with family, while also experiencing sorrow at the lost years and even some jealousy at the life you provided your family while I was left behind. I was hurt by your nonchalant attitude towards your two houses, many cars and 100s of thousands saved for half Sister and half brothers college, while I have 60k in student loans and a phone call three times a year. I would have thought you would use a little tact and understanding to see how that would make me feel but the sentiment seemed to be lost on you. 

You claim to be such a good father, and I can see that you were, but to me you were nowhere to be found when I needed guidance and support. 

I guess you didn’t see how I could feel less than worthy in that moment knowing you didn’t care enough to make sure I started my adult life with the best foot forward. I’m your actual flesh and blood. I did not ask to be born but here we are.

I spent a long time realizing that I am blessed, truly. I have many things in my life to be thankful for and that I am truly more fortunate than most people in this world. My travels have taught me as much and showed me how to appreciate every moment because the next is not a guarantee.

I cant ignore the bad feelings I experienced being around you this weekend and because of that I think it would be best for us to cease communication. I took me time to come to peace with our relationship over the years and I’d like to continue living in my own bubble of peace and happiness.

I hope you can understand where I’m coming from and please know that I am not trying to be mean or hateful. It’s just the opposite. Without conveying my feeling to you it will only hurt me and I’m not willing to live like that. 

I need to get this of my chest so I’d able to move on with my and live in peace. Without regrets of what I did or didn’t say. 

Respectfully,"
27,"I [21F] think my roommate [22F] secretly put her fingerprint in my phone and I don’t know how to approach her about it.


I’m trying not to be paranoid about this situation but I can’t help it. 

my roommate A and I have been living together for about 2 months now. We are coworkers (we have opposite schedules) and are not close friends at all. 

I have my right thumb, my left thumb, and my friend B’s thumb print. I just went to go add another and I saw a fingerprint labeled “Amnda” (how she spells her name occasionally) and it was after B’s thumb print so it had to have been in the last 2 weeks. I haven’t given her my phone for any reason whatsoever so I can’t figure out when she could have done it. 

I deleted it without thinking about keeping it as proof, so I can’t have her test it to see if it’s her print. 

She’s already shown weird behavior towards me and I feel like my privacy has been breached. How do I approach her without coming off as accusatory/rude? 

tl;dr- I know for a fact I haven’t let my roommate touch my phone within the last time of adding a fingerprint onto my iphones unlock setting but there was one labeled under her name. How do I approach her?"
28,"UPDATE: My (23F) dad (60M) is still in the ICU. I just found out he’s been in contact with his ex girlfriend (50sF), who’s in jail for murdering her own child


Previous post: https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/bqeyfp/my_23f_dad_60m_is_in_the_icu_im_flying_home_today/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app

This is all like a terrible dream. No one I’ve talked to in real life can give me any advice because of how off script this is, and I got some amazing advice last time I posted, so I thought I’d try again. 

My dad is still in the ICU. He got better for a little bit, but he started doing much worse so they intubated him again and knocked him out. They’re fairly sure he’ll make it through, but there’s a significant chance still that he won’t. 

So. I’m going to try to be a bit vague for obvious reasons. My dad was dating this terrible woman for years. She had kids much younger than me (I’m 23, they’re 10+ years younger). He would tell me about terrible, abusive things she’d do (screaming at him, abandoning him in strange places, telling him she’d kill herself because of him, and worse). I kept telling him that wasn’t normal and he needed someone who would love and support him, but he’d brush it off. 

A couple of years ago, she sent me some horrible text messages because she found out one of her kids had the same sexuality as me. These texts were vile. Legitimately a hate crime. I screenshotted them, blocked her, and sent the photos to my dad. My dad broke up with her and said that was that. 

I found out last summer he’d been seeing her again and hiding it from me while telling all his friends. One of his closest friends took me aside to tell me while I was back home. It hurt, a lot. When I confronted him about it, he said he was trying to finish with her. When I said how hurt I was he just kinda brushed it off. 

A couple of months ago, he called to tell me she’d been arrested. She murdered her own child. My dad even then was making excuses that she didn’t mean to. There’s irrefutable evidence that she did mean to, that it was planned and thought through. It’s horrific. 

My dad swore he wouldn’t go see her in jail or ever talk to her again. He’s been going to therapy and connecting with old friends (he ditched them all to be with her). He’s been doing really well. 

I was talking to a family member the other day while in the ICU. The family member mentioned my dad should get a restraining order against his ex girlfriend, because she’s been bothering him since he visited her in jail. I think my brain stopped for a moment. He promised me he wouldn’t. And I didn’t make him, he promised not to out of the blue. Every time we talked about it he seemed very clear that he knew she was awful and would stay away. I also found out he took some things from her house while she was in jail on her orders, specifically so her ex husband wouldn’t get ahold of them. That may have been illegal for him to do as well. 

I’m having a really hard time being around him right now. I just want to shake him by the shoulders and scream at him. He drove those kids to school every day for years. He introduced the one she murdered to the book series that was his and my favorite when I was growing up. How could he visit that vile woman in jail? How could he keep doing things for her?

It’s so hard because he’s knocked out, he’s really, really sick, and I know this shouldn’t be front of my mind. But on my own behalf, and on behalf of the child she murdered, I am just so angry with him that he’s still trying to talk to her. I know abusers have a strong hold on their victims. But I’m having a hard time empathising with that right now. And I can’t talk to him about it because of how poorly he’s doing, and obviously it won’t be the first thing I say when he wakes up. 

If anyone has any advice to get me through I’d be really, really grateful. I’m so angry and hurt right now. 

Tl;dr: my dad is in the ICU. His ex girlfriend murdered her own child. He promised he would never see her again, and broke that promise. How do I get through?"
29,"Boyfriend shows no empathy towards me


My boyfriend and I have just moved in together. We started dating at Christmas. Both 28.

Things are amazing one minute and so toxic the next. Our fights are just horrible but they always end with sorry's and forgiveness.

Though lately I've noticed something that has really started to bother me more than any fight.

It's like he has no empathy for me and if someone does me wrong and I tell him about it, he gets mad at me and loses his temper.

The most recent example would be a few moments ago. I have an awful relationship with my mother, I keep away from her. Well today she sent me a message telling me to kill myself, that she wished I had never been born, wished I had been aborted. I was fat, ugly, she never loved me. I was a bit upset, unfortunately I've been told these things since I was 8, today though, it really got to me, as I have had a rough couple of months and I'm just stressed out.

So I came in from work, told him what happened and he freaked out at me, said ""I couldn't give a fuck, I am so sick of you telling me this shit, I don't care, you don't even like your mother, get over yourself"". It really upset me and I told him so and he stormed out.

This isn't the first time, a few weeks ago, my father was really sick and I was upset about it and he lost his temper with me, then a close friend of mine flipped out at me because I couldn't afford to go to a fancy spa weekend with her and when I told him about it, he went mental at me again. It always ends the same way, shut the fuck up and fuck off, then he storms out. It happens all the time and then I give the silent treatment and mention I'm leaving him and he gets all upset, he loves me, he doesn't know what he would do without me etc etc but if I try and bring up his behaviour, he gets mad at me and refuses to discuss it.

Any advice would be really appreciated, I really do love him but I'm just so confused.

Tl;dr

Boyfriend shows no empathy towards my problems and turns it around on me, telling me to get over it"
30,"I [30 F] suspect my aunt's husband is a pedophile [54 /M] I want to confront him on some of his creepy behavior


I suspect my aunt's husband is a pedophile. Recently, he and my aunt moved in with my grandmother due to being evicted.  Because of this fact, I have been avoiding going to my grandma's house. The guy is annoying and creepy. Some of my other relatives stayed away from grandma for the same. Grandma lives about 80 miles away and I cannot drive for medical reasons. I hate to be stuck away from home.

He obsesses over young children in our family. One target is my [2 y/o] foster sister. 

Due to some nightmares, I've felt tempted to visit grandma and call ""uncle"" out on the creepy things he does by mimicking him 

My older relatives think he is rude and weird, but don't dare mention the ""P"" word.


He claimed he was diagnosed with Aspergers in childhood.


Some of the things he does:

-Cursed my grandmother out for preventing him from taking pictures of a toddler to post on social media. He was told repeatedly in the past not to take pictures of this kid spanning more than a year back.

- skipped work for several days to play with my foster sister

- watched my aunt change a baby's diaper, without helping

- came unannounced to my home to play with toddler sister

- snuck out to walk around with my toddler sister

- Invited his tweaker friend over to grandma's house after midnight. Said tweaker refused to leave, ""uncle"" acted like a confused victim when everyone said it was his responsibility to make the guy leave.
Did something similar in the past at my own home. 

- Bothers toddler when she eats. When a young kid is eating, he sits 6 inches away from their face, making enthusiastic sounds, asking them stupid questions like-""does that taste good""

- Eat's young kid's food meant for the child.

-Feeds kids inappropriate things without a parent's permission. once he snuck a 2-day old burger from Mcdonalds. The tot had diarrhea the next day."
31,"My family knew it was my 16th birthday and didnt say anything


It was my 16th last Wednesday so its almost been a week but I just feel so hurt by it. My mum texted me happy birthday while at work ( she was working a night shift). When she came home she didn’t say anything to me, my sister (22) said nothing to me. At around 8pm my sister did say ‘oh happy birthday’ but other than that nothing. A couple months before for my sisters birthday my mum made me order a cake in advance for her and all of this stuff and nobody cared about my birthday. I feel silly being upset about this but its so hurtful that nobody really cared.

Tl;dr
My family knew it was my birthday and all i got was a text from one of them."
32,"I [17F] love my boyfriend [18M] to bits, but after his traumatic event, I’m not sure if I can keep doing this.


I’ve been with my boyfriend for about a year now. He moved schools back in 2017, we met at 16 and we started dating quite quickly. Within about 6 months we started sleeping with one another, and to cut a long story short, he helped me get to a place where I was able to move on from the sexual violence in my past. In fact, he was the guy I lost my consensual virginity to. We really love one another.

So, here’s where the problems started. About 3 months back me and my boyfriend witnessed a car hit a man and his child, which then went into a lamppost. It was late and we were the only people around. My wrist was broken and so he was the one who had to perform CPR on the man who was not breathing while I stayed with the child. The ambulance took what felt like forever, and CPR was performed for about 15 minutes. The man did not make it, nor did the driver. The next day we find out that the guy in the car was actually a kid from the year above. It was common knowledge in our school that he liked to race for money. This news broke him.

Over the past few months, he has just changed so much. He used to be so sweet and kind, and now he’s so snappy at everyone, including me. He’s gotten physically confrontational with others at school, many of them being friends with the boy who died. His usually high grades have crumbled to bits week by week. I knew that he would have to grieve, but I’m pretty sure he’s got PTSD from it. He spoken to me about how much he keeps remembering all the blood, and the body, and how fucked up the driver looked. I’ve tried my best, done all I think I can do and yet it’s not seemed to help at all.

While I love him, I’m no longer enjoying our relationship. I love him, I want to help him, but I also want to be happy. I want to stay, but it’s beginning to take its toll on me. I’m tired of it. And while this makes me feel disgusted with myself, I think my eyes are starting to wander subconsciously. I don’t even know if I have it in me to break up with him; I’d feel like I was abandoning him at a time where he needs people most. His parents aren’t really there for him, he’s burned his bridges with most of his mates  due to the snappiness and physicality. I’m probably the only person around who still cares enough to worry.

I just feel so lost and confused about what to do, for both me and him. Please, help me.

TL:DR - My boyfriend went through trauma, it’s affecting all of his relationships, I’m not sure if I can continue like this."
33,"My (29F) brother (20M) has been letting his GF (20F) “borrow” my clothes without asking me. Then, he lied about it.


Up until recently, I have been working abroad and have been keeping my things at my parents’ house. My work is pretty intense (I work in humanitarian relief work), and I come home every few months. Each time I’ve been home, I go through and clear out things to give away; as a result, I don’t have that much stuff anymore, and everything I do have, I have because I love.

Recently, I came home after finishing a tough assignment and went through my closet and realized that I couldn’t find my favorite dresses. After cleaning further and confirming that my mom hasn’t seen them, I asked my brother, since he’s the only other person living at home right now.

He denied knowing anything, saying that he only borrowed old clothes from another family member (who isn’t home now and also stores clothes in that closet). After looking further, I realized that I had several things missing: the dresses, but also shirts, a sweater, athletic leggings and shorts. The kicker: I also found several handles of alcohol hidden in my closet, proving that my brother had been through my things. 

Furious, I confronted him again, and he said that he’d take care of getting my things back. My brother has been dating a girl for a couple of months now, and apparently she’s been staying over at the house when my mom’s at work.  I’ve met her once or twice, but otherwise she’s a stranger. When I pressed the issue again later, apparently she was “borrowing” the things for an event and I’ll receive everything back within the week. 

The whole thing is really weird: Who borrows all these things? And why did my brother have to gaslight me and deny that he knew anything? 

It’s been upsetting. I’m not home often. I’ve been abroad and missing home and now feel like the small slice that was mine (a few shelves) isn’t mine. I hate that my brother thought it was OK to basically give away my things and then later lie about it. It would be one thing if he asked, but not a word. So one of my favorite dresses (given to me by my favorite cousin) is out there in the world being worn by some clueless twenty-year-old, who either had no idea that I wasn’t OK with this arrangement or, worse, didn’t give a shit.

What do I do here, Reddit? I’m less concerned about my things and more concerned about my brother and the fact that his moral compass is really shitty. He’s too old to doing this shit, and I don’t quite know how to have a relationship with him when he’s proven to be untrustworthy on a number of occasions now. His lying habit usually arises when he’s trying to cover up a mistake; he also got in a car accident last year and hid it from my parents, who are now paying insane car insurance costs. He’s living at home now, but he continues to hide from conflict and his responsibilities. I’m concerned that he’s not becoming a good person.

TL;DR! My brother and his GF went through and took some of my things while I was away. He denied it but eventually admitted it after I confronted him again. He regularly lies to cover up mistakes. How do I deal with him?"
34,"My [32F] sister-in-law [40F] sent me a passive aggressive text about Fathers Day and I don’t know how to respond.


I’m thinking of saying:

“My Dad has never once personally called or emailed me to say happy birthday, Merry Christmas, etc. in my life. I have always done that for him, including sending cards and gifts from Australia.

My parents have been ignoring me since I spoke up when they hurt my feelings a few weeks ago. There's nothing more I can do on my end. I'm hoping they are able to engage with me to have a conversation about what happened. Until then, I'm tired of putting the effort in to only be hurt or ignored in return. I'm going through as much as I can handle right now with the legal battle and restructuring at work. 

I appreciate your kind intentions, but this is an issue between my parents and I. It should not be the concern of anyone else. Thanks for respecting my boundary here ❤️“

TL;DR: Sister-in-law sent a passive aggressive text about Father’s Day. I don’t think it was right for her to hint anything about my relationship with my Dad since he and I have an issue right now. Would really appreciate advice. Thank you."
35,"My (29f) husband (32m) was physically violent with me for the first time and now I'm wondering whether I should tell him I'm pregnant and how to deal with all of this.


My husband and I have been married for three happy years. He has never EVER been anywhere close to being physically violent/abusive toward me, no matter how bad an argument is. In fact, he is usually the one who steps down from an argument, or the first to try to diffuse the situation, when we fight. I've never encountered him being violent with anyone else either. He has always been one of the kindest people I know.

However, as of late, he's been under a lot of stress due to his work. I have never seen him as tired and worn out as he does now. I don't want to divulge too much about his career, but only that he's a businessman and it's a demanding job that requires him to travel often. He's actually been contemplating stepping down from the job for a little over a year, but despite how much he's growing to dislike it (although he does not like to admit this), he still stays. Personally, I think it's because of the money. He makes more in a year than he's probably every hoped to and I think it's hard for him to let that go despite the fact that even if he were to quit today, we'd be financially set for the rest of our lives.

We had a talk around five months ago that it might be time to start a family. We both want kinds and both of our careers were steady and we have a beautiful home. So I went off birth control around four months ago. While he was away in Europe the last week, I found out I was pregnant. Of course I was over the moon and so so excited to share the news with him when he came back. I even wrapped up a test and put it in a box as one of those surprise gifts for him.

His flight back landed yesterday afternoon. We had reservations for a nice dinner but I could tell immediately once he set foot in the house that we wouldn't be going. He looked visibly exhausted and frankly, flat-out ignored me and bolted straight for the bedroom. I didn't push and let him sleep for about two hours before I went in and asked if he was feeling alright. He snapped at me, told me to leave him the fuck alone and that he had a migraine. It stung a bit since I'd planned a pretty amazing evening for the both of us but I obviously understood that he wasn't feeling well. I poured him some water and left some Tylenol for him and didn't bother him for another four hours. I cooked some dinner and around 9:00 pm I brought a plate to him and found that he was awake. He was just laying on the bed on his phone and I reminded him not to use his phone when he had a migraine since it could make it worse and he told me to stop nagging him and to ""get out."" It's not like him to be like this at all so I pushed and asked what was wrong and if anything happened that I should know of. He said no then told be to please ""shut the fuck up.""

At this point I was still standing about two feet from the bed. I was going to step forward and set the dinner plate down and grab him the water I had brought earlier to see if he wanted some but right as I stepped forward, he literally lunged out from his position on the bed, smacked the dinner plate out of my hand and shouted, ""I told you to get the fuck out of my sight!"" I was so shocked that I couldn't move, just watched as the plate shattered on the ground. At this point, he got out of the bed and shoved me hard two times. It was hard enough that on the second shove, I actually fell over and in the process cut my thigh on a piece of the broken plate. I hadn't even noticed the cut then. I was just half-lying there on my back while my husband just stared at me from above. I think he started to apologize, but I just got up and ran out the room crying.

I grabbed a few things from my dressing room, the ""present"" I hid in the living room, and a couple other things and left the house. I booked a hotel room not far from where we live and that's where I have been since last night. He's called and texted many times, but I haven't answered. He actually came by the hotel at around 2:00 am to look for me but the hotel hadn't given him any information. I only found out today when I was going out to buy some lunch and the lady who checked me in the other night pulled me aside and told me what happened and asked if I needed her to contact anyone.

I don't know what to do at this point. Half of me desperately wants to go home to him and talk to him (he says he wants to talk and tell me everything) and the other half of me is so scared to go back; not because I'm scared he'll hurt me again (I'm not for some reason), but scared that I'll have to face what happened again and how everything has changed and maybe that I'll never see him in the same way. I listened to one of his voicemails from about 4:00 am and he was crying and apologizing and begging me for forgiveness and that he doesn't know what came over him and that he would never do anything like it again.

I haven't told anyone what's happened and I don't want this to spread. I just feel so horribly alone at this moment and at a complete loss. I feel like I shouldn't tell him that I'm pregnant anytime soon now, but at the same time, I feel like he has a right to know soon. I just really don't know. To be honest, I was hit with a wave of overwhelming fear last night that I would be alone in this pregnancy and that our marriage has been falling apart right before my eyes and I did not even realize it.

Should I just go back to the house tomorrow and talk to him? Should I wait to let him know about the pregnancy? I still love him so much and I always will and I sincerely do think he feels the same way. I just don't know what's wrong with him...

TL;DR: My husband works a very lucrative yet highly demanding and stressful job that has taken a toll on him. He has been wanting to quit but just can't seem to do it. We've been trying for a baby and I recently found out I was pregnant while he was away in Europe for work. I was going to tell him when he came back but when he came home, he was visibly exhausted and upset. He snapped and yelled at me multiple times and finally flipped out when I brought him dinner. He whacked the dinner plate out of my hands and shoved me until I fell and cut myself on a piece of the broken plate. I stayed at a hotel nearby for the past day. Don't know whether to go back and talk to him tomorrow or not and if I should not tell him about the pregnancy."
36,"My (F24) boyfriend (M24) of 6yrs called me a hoe and is now avoiding me


So yesterday morning my bf is being super sweet and tells me he really can't wait to see me when he gets home from work...Several hours into the morning he calls me. Towards the end of the call he's telling me about something that happened with the guys the day before at our house.


Let's pause here for a recap. For the last 5 years, I have audibly maintained the fact that I DO NOT like and do not want him inviting people over to our house when it's a mess. I've told him I don't mind if it's cluttered, but I do if it's just straight up gross.
A little over a week ago, I broke a bone in my hand and had a cast put on. I can't do dishes. I can't put away laundry. I can't even get a freaking trash bag open to throw trash away.. Since this has happened, our house has gotten to a point that I'm ashamed to even admit. I like to keep a clean house, whereas he will live in filth and couldn't care less.


So as soon as he said he had the guys over-I freaked. He said I didn't understand why he had them over, but when explained it boiled down to he just wanted to have them over in the moment. He kept saying it wasn't a big deal and I shouldn't let it bother me. Which just made me more angry. I brought up how we've had this conversation countless times in the last 5years. He claims he just doesn't remember stuff like that but he will work on it.I told him I know that's BS bc of the excuses he made and that he just doesn't care enough to do anything more than say he'll work on it. Because this happens every.single.time. I'm obviously mortified that he had them over-But the real issue for me is the complete lack of respect.


A few hours pass and I apologize for speaking so angrily to him..Later we go out to dinner with his family. On our way back home, he's talking about his family. He talked/ranted about them till we were almost home. He asked me what I thought their deal was and I said I think they just don't care about anyone but themselves. That they're selfish. His response? ""Wow, thanks for contributing to the conversation with your original thoughts."" So I told him maybe my thought would have sounded more original if he had asked what I thought before he said everything in the book on the way home. I asked him what his issue was with me and he said ""I'm sure you'll figure it out."" I told him I was sick of his attitude and hypocrisy for always getting on my case about communicating with him. We fought for a while and twice he told me heatedly ""shut.your.mouth."" Later he called me a hoe three or four times. I didn't catch all of what he was saying. Something about how I'm gonna do something like a hoe because that's what hoes do, hoe.


I've about had it with the lack of respect. I've tried adressing the situation but when I do, he just goes to bed. I'm not looking for advice to dump him, or ppl being hateful. We're all people here who make mistakes. I'm just looking for advice on how to move forward and how to encourage but not push a conversation. He's shutting me out and there's an underlying issue obviously. 


TL;DR Bf had friends over to our DISGUSTING house after I've asked him for 5yrs not to, got angry at my response about what his family's deal is, told me to shut my mouth, called me a hoe and is avoiding me. I don't know how to move forward."
37,"My[28f] boyfriend [30m] of 1 year just dumped me because I refuse to stop driving for lyft.


We lost our jobs (same place) 2/3 weeks ago. Everything is in my name. Rent, car payment, insurance, utilities. I have until next Friday to pay my car and insurance is past due. Plus rent is creeping up. 

I started talking about doing lyft/instacart as a side gig over a month ago and signed up. Tonight was my first time doing it because he's very against it. He said doesn't want me driving around with dudes all day for my safety but I think its a jealousy thing. 

He's always assuming things despite my never cheating. Today he flipped out about my white v neck t shirt because ""your tits are hanging out"". They're not. Not even a boob crack. The shirt is very slightly sheer (like most women's cheap clothing thse days) and I had on a flesh toned bra. I felt I looked nice and got angry that he was telling me to change on our way out the door. I have big boobs. Nothing is gonna change that. Every shirt they are there. 

Sorry back to the lyft thing. To placate him I said what if you come with me? Found out the other day he's not allowed. He was furious that ""I changed the plan"" insinuating I was lying when I said he could come. Honestly I didn't want him to but I didn't know he couldn't come until the other day. I feel like any other job this would be unacceptable so I don't see how it's different. 

Yesterday I casually said I wanna drive at certain hours for peak money. I keep saying hey we're broke and we really need to get on it. But I've felt pressured not to. He was furious that I was making plans without talking to him. I thought my saying that was talking to him?

 He dragged me around and kept me at his cousin's house so I didn't get the chance to make any money. I lamented that we're cutting it really close and that I wanted to spend the weekend driving. He said we'd have time tonight after a bbq for his family. 

On the way home I said we still have time and I was still offering to let him come. He said he wanted to stay home. The tone came across like you're doing that too. I stayed quiet then when we got home I made sure he ate and showed him the app that it was peak driving time. 

We got into an argument immediately he didn't want to hear anything I was saying so I got fed up and left. I did 3 rides in less than 2 hours made $40 and went home because I don't have any gas from taking him to and from seeing his family out of state for 2 days. 

I'm trying to explain that my back is against the wall. I am stressed out and he's acting like I'm out stripping or worse. When I came home he didn't want to talk to me. I did keep pushing because I'm trying to compromise. I offered to just do mornings on weekdays. He doesn't like that idea. I want to work weekends. I live in a major city and weekends are prime money making time. 

He was mad I left angry and so late (11pm). I apologized for how I left and tried to explain why. I felt like it was better do just do it and deal with him after which was probably not fair. This is where I'd say ""but you made me feel like I couldn't"" and I'd be told I only care how I feel. I also texted him every 30 minutes when I was out to check in. 

He told me it was a deal breaker that he doesn't wanna hear I'm grown and told me to do whatever I want. I said I'm trying to pay for food and a roof for us. He said no it's for you I don't need it I'll make money if I do. But he isn't doing anything. He said he doesn't want me to do it period. I asked him what he thinks we should do to pay these bills and eat but he made no suggestions. He hasn't even applied for a new job.

 Yesterday he told me he was going to ask his cousin for money and pay back slowly. I'm not comfortable with that at all. I've always been self sufficient. His cousin is also young and its embarrassing to me. I was angry he made a decision like that right after being mad at me for ""making decisions without him"" because I was talking about lyft hours. He never discusses what he's doing he just does it. Even getting a dog he basically said too bad. Now we have a dog. 
 
I told him I'm not gonna stop doing what I have to do for us. He said its for me and broke up with me. 

So am I really out of line? I don't know what to do. I am terrified of losing my car my apartment and everything I've worked so hard for. He told me I'm selfish and I only ever care about how I feel. He said that about the shirt thing today too. I guess that's true because I don't plan on stopping lyft or dressing differently though I know he hates it. I should note I'm a jeans and teeshirt kind of girl. I don't even own ""inappropriate"" clothing.

**TL;DR: boyfriend said me or lyft and I chose lyft**"
38,"My mother (62F) doesn’t want me (29M) and my fiancée (25F) staying together the night before our wedding at a hotel


But the catch is that we both live abroad, where we have lived together for 2 years and will be travelling back to the country to get married.

Our wedding reception is being held at a nice hotel, which we organized from abroad, so I thought it would be a great idea if we stayed in the hotel the night before the wedding and also the night of the wedding for simplicity and to make things far less stressful this way.

The reason my mom wants us to stay back at my parents place (albeit: together in the same room) is because she says my grandmother, my uncles, aunties and some of my older cousins on her side of the family would be “shocked” if they found out we stayed together in the hotel together the night before, and this isn’t how things would do things traditionally.

With staying at my parents place she’d be able to tell her relatives that “they stayed in different rooms.”

I want to respect my mom’s requests, but I also feel like this will make it more complicated for us and is treating me like a child still a bit.

TL;DR My mother doesn’t want me and my fiancée staying together the night before our wedding at a hotel, for simplicity, even though we’ve lived together for 2 years because my relatives could find out"
39,"My (38F) younger sister (20F) sent me a scathing text message after I sent a Happy Father's Day message to my Dad


TL;DR - my 20 year-old sister sent me an insulting and personally attacking text message after I reached out to my estranged father and wished him a Happy Father's Day.

&amp;#x200B;

Long story short, my parents and I don't really speak much.  I made a decision in my love life  that my mother didn't agree with (broke up with a long term partner of 7 years and started dating someone new shortly after - no cheating).  Since then, it was tacitly understood that I was to hide half of who I am and not talk about my new partner or any part of my life that has to do with him.  I never offered any info.  My mother never asked.  My new partner has never been invited to any family events and I've been told he's not welcome (mother has only met him once).  We've been together 2 years now - own a house, started a business together.  In March, I decided it was too emotionally draining to continue suppressing a large part of who I am and decided, for my own mental health and well-being, that I was not going to engage in any conversation with my mother via text.  She has sent roughly 4 messages in the last six months to which I have not responded (as I deemed them to be emotionally manipulative and am actively trying to remove that kind of toxicity from my life).  I did not message her on Mother's Day.  I do not speak to my father much either.  Mostly because I don't want to put him in the middle as I know he has to share any message I send him with my mother.  I have two sisters who are much younger than me (20 &amp; 18).  I have not spoken to them in a year.  I sent xmas presents and text them on their bdays but they haven't reached out once.

&amp;#x200B;

Today I hummed and hawwed about messaging my father to wish him Happy Father's Day.  I have been starting to feel in a better place emotionally and mentally and thought I was ready to reach out to my parents.  I wanted to start with my Dad because he has never really instigated any toxic behaviours.  I know he is just following what my mother wants and trying to ""keep the peace"". 

&amp;#x200B;

I sent the message wishing him Happy Dad Day.

He responded that it was better since he heard from me.

I told him  I loved him.

He responded that he loved me too.

&amp;#x200B;

At around 9pm, I received the following message from my 20-year old sister and I'm devastated. 

&amp;#x200B;

"" I know we haven't talked in months but just wanted to let you know you're not welcome in this house or anywhere near me. The fact that you had the balls to wish dad a happy father's day and have ignored mom for months truly speaks of your character. You're a selfish immature bitch. Mom and Dad are both crying right now because of what you've done to this family. You think you're innocent when all you've done is ruin everyones relationship with you. No one in this family respects you. I will never be able to have a relationship with you ever again because you disgust me and will never be able to act like a mature adult. You're not a teenager anymore yet you act like one! Grow up and don't ever contact us again. You've lost your sisters and your mom so hope it was all worth it!"" 

&amp;#x200B;

 I haven't been able to sleep because I feel utterly alone and broken and as if I've been sucked back into the toxicity and poison that I tried so hard to escape from and that I thought I was slowly putting behind me.  I'm not quite sure what to do or how to move forward from this.  Any thought I had about getting back in touch with my parents has now been quashed.   How can I move forward?  How can I compartmentalize and pack away an interaction such as this so that it doesn't impact my daily life e.g sleep, work, existing healthy relationships? 

 I feel utterly alone."
40,"Help! My (26X) parents (58F 51M) are using my community beach and getting into shenanigans


Hi Reddit. I bought my first home a year and a half ago in a long-standing community. There's no HOA but homeowners can pay a small due to the community association for access to special events etc. 

All community members have access to the community beach. The stated rules include no alcohol and all beachgoers must be accompanied by a community member. 

I took my parents to the community beach a few times last summer because I actually didn't know about it when I first moved in. My parents have helped me out with my house (screening in my porch, helped me move in and paint, etc.) but I am financially independent from them. I have a few kayaks to use at the beach and I've taken my parents this year. They bought inflatable kayaks for themselves.

This summer my parents have been coming over largely unannounced (maybe a text on the way over) to my house every weekend to go kayaking off my community beach. I told them they should park on the street but they're afraid of being sideswiped so they park in my driveway and block my partner in. 

Yesterday they came over and brought coolers of alcohol (in the past they've had a few beers while floating out in the water). I actually didn't see them at all, I was out running errands when they came over. Around 6pm I got a call from my mom asking me to help her pack stuff in the car (we would drive to the beach together from my house). I was home watching a movie with my partner. I told her it would be inconvenient and she said my dad was completely wasted and fell in the water, she had to rescue him and row them both back to the beach (!). He had been drinking vodka orange juice.

On the way to the beach my mom was joking around and acting like what happened was funny. I told her that the rules say no alcohol and she said ""There's people drinking there all the time."" Which could be true but I personally haven't seen, but they've been to the beach every weekend and I've only been once this season so who knows! :) 

When we got to the beach my dad was totally incoherent and could barely stumble back to the car. He threw up in the grass and was shouting loudly asking, ""Whose party did I drink the alcohol for? Whose alcohol was that?"" etc. I told him he went kayaking with my mom and he shouted ""That's so fucked up!"" Lmao. I guess I could mention that my parents are divorced. 

It was an ordeal to get him back in the car, but finally we got everything packed up and my mom drove me back to my house and she left from there. No apologies or anything.

I tried to look at the community center website to see if they have any stated actions against breaking the rules and couldn't find anything for my community, but I did see on other local community websites that rule breaking could result in loss of privileges. 

Am I right to feel upset about this or am I being uptight? I personally don't feel that my parents should be using my beach access without me and without asking first. Certainly not every weekend, and absolutely not getting drunk enough to disrupt the neighborhood. But I second guess myself, which my partner says is because my mom is a narcissist. Does anyone have experience with this? How should I handle this situation without ruining my relationship with my parents?

Tl;dr - Parents are using my community beach access without my permission, breaking stated rules, and getting drunk and disruptive. I want to know how to set boundaries with them without ruining our relationship."
41,"My (16f) autistic step-sister (f19) had a fit and ruined a lot of my things. My parents refuse to punish her and I don't know how to get over it


So my step-sister ""Cara "" has been my step-sister for a little over 3 years now. She's 19 but according to her dad/my step-dad she has the mentally of a 7, maybe 8 hear old. She has really bad impulse issues, she's been arrested for shoplifting before. She still sometimes has accidents and wears a diaper overnight. She has fits where she will just flip out over some small injustice and destroy everything around her. It's been really tough to live with her but she is on several medications and has several therapy appointments each week


So with my step-sister having all of her issues, I've had to get summer jobs either baby sitting or dog walking to pay for my own things. My mom stopped buying my school clothes for me when I was 14. This year I was finally able to get a real job working at my movie theater. It's not great and I make minimum wage but I was able to save all of my paychecks and buy myself a lot of new clothes and makeup. 

What started the argument we had last night was my step-sister wanted to try on some of my clothes and I said no. She went and tattled on me to my nom and my mom came into my room to tell me to let her do it. I said no, it's not fair for her to try on (and eventually take because she's done this before) my clothes when I've paid for them. My mom said that I can just buy whatever I want over again since I'm working. I guess our argument triggered her sensory disorder and she flipped out. She punched my mirror and shattered it, cutting her hand really bqd. She kicked a hole in my wall and was starting to cry and scream. She picked up my makeup bag and threw it across the room where everything in it broke. She lurged at me and my mom had my step#dad come in to bear hug her and calm her down. She ended up having to go to the hospital and get stitches in her hand over how hard she punched my mirror 

My mom and step-dad blame me over it now that she's home. All of my new clothes are now in her room and instead of being happy she got what she wanted, she poured bleach and toothpaste all over them and now her room stinks and smells so bad. My parents want me to pay for her hospital bill now

I don't know how to not be angry. A lot of my things were messed up. I didn't mean to trigger and upset her but I just didn't want her messing with my things.  My parents are still mad and tell me she can't be held responsible because she's disabled. That I should just give in and let her do what she wants to do. I don't know how to move past this. I could really use some advice on this

Tl;dr: autistic step-sister had a melt down and destroyed a lot of my things. Parents blame me and say she can't be held responsible. I'm just upset and don't know how to get past it"
42,"Me (22F) with my husband (21M) married 3 months. He didn't believe I was a virgin and has been acting cold since.


First of all to answer the question I know everyone is going to ask, no, neither of us are from especially religious families nor are we ourselves. We ARE Christian and we DO regularly attend church but there were no purity vows or chewed gum metaphors. We both just genuinely wanted to wait because that was our personal decision. Spirituality figured into that choice *some* but not entirely - we both just liked the idea of being safe and committed to one person before having sex. We had kissed and made out and engaged in some touching so it's not like we felt any sexual contact before marriage would damn our eternal souls. We've been together 4 years in total and known each other since middle school. I thought we had good communication and knew where each other stood. 

Which is why his reaction has been so incredibly weird. 

So we got married and then proceeded to the hotel the night before we were to leave on our honeymoon. Things started out the usual way, but obviously didn't stop there. I didn't have a lot of pain, just some mild burning that passed quickly and I didn't bleed a drop. Husband enjoyed himself as well. 

He got withdrawn immediately after. 

I thought he was just a little tired or overwhelmed or processing, so I gave him some space, just took his hand and we fell asleep. He was weird the whole next day. We got to our honeymoon destination and he immediately dropped it on me. 

""Why did you tell me you were a virgin when you aren't?""

""I told you that because I WAS one.""

""But you said it hardly hurt. And you didn't bleed.""

Ok. So. We had talked about or attitudes towards sex but never the act itself, I thought maybe he just got bad information. I explained how not all women even HAVE a hymen, and if they do, it can be small, thin, and/or easily broken by things like tampons (which I use), exercise, bike riding, or it can just ""wear away"" if there wasn't much of a one to start with. That sex might be mildly uncomfortable the first time, but if it actually HURTS and there's BLOOD you've done something wrong, or the woman has a very thick hymen and may need it surgically corrected. 

He wasn't having it. I finally just said ""Ok, so who would I have even had sex with? We've talked about this. We both chose to wait because we WANTED to wait and if I wasn't a virgin I'd have told you then because I believed you weren't super hung up on it, it was just something you/I/we thought was best."" 

Then he says ""Oh so you're admitting you lied now?"" 

Omg. 

I didn't even know what else to say so I just said ""I know what I did and didn't do, you're being ridiculous and I don't know why. When you want to actually talk about it then we can but I'm not going to be accused.""

The honeymoon was awkward. The 4th day was ok so I tried to initiate sex. Figured maybe he was just freaked out and he had worked it out. He seemed into it and then just said ""I can't"" and rolled over. 

It's been like this for 3 months. I can't even bring it up. I've tried a couple times, but it always goes the same way. I lied. I had ""an alibi ready"". 

I don't even know where this is coming from. Maybe he's more faith based in this respect than I thought? But I can't control what my body did or didn't do. I've tried to empathize with him that if marrying a virgin was important to him and he believes I'm not, that sucks, but *I was*. 

How do you even prove you DIDN'T do something? 

Where do I go from here? 

tl;dr Christian but not extremely so couple decides to wait til marriage. Wedding night goes smoothly, and now husband believes wife was not actually a virgin. Where do we go from here?"
43,"I [21F] don't like my brother [18M] as a person anymore. It's breaking my heart


tl;dr my brother has become arrogant, rude, self-righteous and entitled recently. I don't like him anymore and it's upsetting me. Is his attitude something that could pass?

I love my brother, but I don't like him. A few years ago he got very into drugs and became ""spiritual"", he became very rude to our mother, and patronising towards me. e.g. once he said ""you wouldn't understand, you've never done drugs so you don't know what the world is really like"". He generally talks down to me and I'm pretty sure he sees himself as smarter than me (and most people).

He's recently become vegan and he's got worse - I'm a vegetarian which he says is ""pointless"" as I haven't completely cut out dairy. He has a very holier than thou attitude about it, and will regularly talk down to meat eaters. It's very difficult because I do agree with a lot of what he says, he just goes about everything the wrong way and it can make people feel uneasy. He is your typical 'preachy vegan'.

He sees himself as very wise. Recently he got himself into a bad situation. As a result of this, he fell out with about 5 of his friends. He does not seem to understand what he did wrong, but it's obvious that he did do wrong (I can't say what he did as would be easily identifiable if he found this post). After this happened he said ""well I've learnt that my wisdom is a gift and a curse"".

It's becoming exhausting, I dread visiting home because all the attention is on him and his attitude. I'm visiting currently. He's spent his money on pointless, expensive things and complains about being 'poor'. Our mother made food for us both, and he ate all of it. Mum accidentally bought him a leather belt and he threw a fit. He speaks to everyone like cr*p and seems to see himself as God's gift. He's completely self absorbed.

Every conversation you have with him either leads to him preaching about something, or a massive argument. Sometimes it's easier to just shrug or nod or brush him off.

It's hard to put the whole thing into words and there's so much more I could type. But the worst part is, that I just don't like him as a person anymore. I can't have a conversation with him. Our parents are divorced and it's just us two kids so we used to be really close. Now I feel like I don't even know him anymore. I stopped talking to him for 2 months and he didn't even notice. 

Has anyone else been through this with anyone? I feel like I'm waiting for him to snap out of it / go back to his 'old self' because if he's like this forever then I don't want to spend my time with him. Or do you think there is anything I should be doing to help? He struggles to form and maintain friendships because of his attitude and I don't know if it's a sign that something more is wrong?"
44,"My bf(30) me (25) is having an online female friend stay with him for 2 weeks


I’ll start of with saying I’m not a jealous person at all but I’ve been dealing with a situation for a while that bothers me and I’m wondering if my feelings are valid. My boyfriend started talking to this girl online a few months ago who lives in another country and he recently told me that she was going to come out to meet him and stay at his house for a week. This caught me guard because he didn’t even ask me to make sure I was comfortable with that, If I was in his position I feel like I would have. So this girl come out to stay with him and I met her twice while she was here, she didn’t really put much effort into getting to know me and spent the majority of her time here alone with my bf. The last night she was here she said she wanted to come back soon and my bf encouraged her to. Well 2 weeks after leave she is back and is now staying with him for 2 weeks. He constantly down plays my feelings and thinks I’m overreacting to the situation and that it’s not unusual at all. If it makes any difference she posts nudes on ig and my bf likes them haha. She even took nudes in his house and posted them which I almost felt like was on purpose to piss me off. Am I overreacting?? Is there relationship inappropriate? 

TL;DR boyfriend is having female friend he’s never met stay with him for weeks am I wrong for being uncomfortable?"
45,"I'm (21m) worried for my brother (18m) who takes drugs and sleeps with random men


Apologies if my English's poor.

I live with my parents and attend university for mechanical engineering. My brother moved out of home 7 months ago, a little before becoming of age. He and our step-dad hated each other, there were physical attacks too. They couldn't live together.

My brother moved in with his high school friend. He lived there for only a few weeks. Then he started going to a homeless shelter, but soon he met his boyfriend (19) online. Now they're living together. The dad of brother's boyfriend feels bad for abandoning his family/cheating on the mom, so he lets them do anything.

They use the boyfriend's allowance for buying drugs, cocaine I think. My brother never did drugs before this. They also have sex with older guys from dating apps who're usually married (brother says his boyfriend has a fetish for that... don't even ask). One of them was an alcoholic with brain damage from addiction. He used to stalk them until the boyfriend's dad chased him away.

I'm sure my brother doesn't tell me half of everything that happens. He used to text me regularly after leaving because he felt lonely. Now we don't talk a lot, especially if I say critical things. The last time I saw him was two weeks ago, me and mom went to buy him new shoes. He looked really mentally down.

What can I actually do to help? How to support him? I'm afraid worse stuff will happen from now on.

Tldr: Brother is in a bad state since he has left home. Don't know how to help."
46,"My (20sF) brother (30s M) infedelity with his wife (30sF)


So there's a popular pharmacy/store where it's known for their long receipts and last time I was there I had my email added to their system so it would stop printing the obnoxiously long receipts and the coupons that print out would be emailed to my email. My whole family uses the same number since we've been long time members. We rarely even purchase stuff at this store because sometimes they are pricier than other stores, this would be our last resort or ""emergency"" stop for us.

My brother (Who I will refer to as ""D"" from now on) is off on business and he happened to go to one of these stores in the city he is staying in and to my surprise I received the receipt into my email and it showed me every single item purchased.  The receipt has the location where the items were purchased so I know it was ""D"". ""D"" had left this morning maybe 6 am and the time of purchase was around 2 pm. ""D"" bought sports drink, candy, lube and condoms. I was confused when I saw this email since I was at work. I figured that MAYBE his wife (who i will refer to as ""V"") had gone with him and they were going to ya know, do some stuff together, whatever, cool. It being fathers day I waited to see my mom later on to ask her if  ""V"" had gone on the trip as well. Mom said no. So I asked if my ""D"" ever mentioned meeting a coworker at the airport or maybe they saw this person at the terminal as well, and another no. My mom seemed confused by my questions so I stopped asking them and continued with our lives. She had mention that ""V"" was at home and didn't want to come join our fathers day dinner.

My brother was diagnosed with bp2 and I don't want him to go into a psychosis again or have him institutionalized. I know his actions are not my fault but I just don't know how to tell ""V"". I'm sure he's having an affair with a coworker. I already have a place to stay in case this boils over since ""D"" is known to not recognize me/gets violent during psychosis.

My plan was to tell ""V"" the day ""D"" is due back, which is in maybe 3 days, i dont know exactly, but i dont know how to word it. Tell her in person? text? screenshot only? im scared.

TLDR: brother bought condoms and lube, wife isn't with him. he's on a business trip. Don't know when or how to tell his wife. we all live together."
47,"My (27F) boyfriend (28M) wants me to get my own apartment for a year before we move in together. Is he being reasonable?


Greetings guys. My boyfriend and I met in college and during my last semester we were practically glued at the hip. I kind of de facto moved into his dorm and I admit I was a stage five clinger. A lot of my personal issues stem from deep childhood trauma related to how my borderline mother gaslights me and makes me feel incompetent by screaming at me that I'm doing things incorrectly when I try to do tasks in her presence. I won't go into too much detail here, but she does not respect normal boundaries. She will go into full on banshe screaming mode over something as insignificant as someone left the light on and she never apologizes for her mistakes.

After college, I moved back with my parents, where I've stayed for ever since for the last three years. My mom's treatment of me has broken down my spirit and confidence, but I've tried my best. During that time, my boyfriend and I broke up as he was moving downstate to take a job offer. He also perceived I was expecting him to whisk me away and become a dependent on him. Valid point, as at the time I didn't even have a driver's license and was depending on my mom to drive me to work and back. That just wasn't attractive to him. 

After we broke up and he moved I went into a depression of extreme self doubt that contributed to me staying at a part time job that did not pay enough for me to move out for far too long. Long story short, boyfriend lost his job as a software engineer due to a wave of layoffs in his  company, moved back to my area with his parents, and decided to give us another shot. During our time apart (a little over a year), I got my driver's license, bought and paid off a car, paid off my student loans, dated, did a road trip etc. My attitude improved.

 He moved in with my parents and I while looking for a new job. His career as a programmer is probably his number one priority in life and the job loss devastated him. Our situation was pretty dire as he was running out of savings nearing the 5th month of unemployment. Thankfully he was hired as a programmer at a great company in the nick of time. A month later I landed my first full time position at a large university. Pay is not stellar for a college grad (low 30s gross) but the position itself is a low stress 9-5 admin type of deal with sweet benefits, including free tuition for a master's degree. 

Fast forward to today. We're both commuting together, waking up super early and not coming home until 7 at night. 
This isn't sustainable and we're both at a point where we're figuring out what the best living situation would be for us in terms of moving closer to our jobs. 

Boyfriend is hesitant to get an apartment with me as I've never been on my own before and never had the proper level of independence he wants from a partner. He thinks I've never formed a proper identity due to my codependent tendencies and that I cannot grow if I'm living with my abusive mom. He wants me to have a year of independent living under my belt, handling my own lease away from my parents, before making the decision to move in together. I tend to agree with this, but still have fears that he's not making future plans with me in mind. He says that after my year of adulting and growing away from my parents, he will consider making the next step.

Do you guys think his reservations are valid or is he just being commitment phobic? 

TLDR: I was previously codependent with my boyfriend and aside from dorming, never lived on my own away from my abusive BPD mom. Boyfriend wants me to get my own apartment for a year to heal and gain an identity before we move in together."
48,"Me [35 M] with my friend [35 M]. Friend pinched my 3.5 year old daughter's nose for disciplinary reasons (or maybe as a reflex?); I proceeded to kick his family out of my home


We were having a nice BBQ at my house on fathers day, with my friend, his wife and their 2 young kids (3 and 2). We've known these folks for years, they are our best friends, and we have kids that are about the same age as theirs so we've grown even closer in the last few years.


At one point during the BBQ, my 3.5 year old daughter started banging on the water heater enclosure making a loud noise. I'm manning the grill, and my wife was talking to her friend, so my friend, went to see what was going on and proceeded to pick up my daughter. To this, my kid got upset and smacked my friend in the face. He responded to her attack by pinching her so hard on the nose that she started crying hysterically. As he brought her closer to me, I saw that she had a very noticeable red mark on her nose. I asked him to hand her to me, and told him, ""that was way too hard, bro"". I took my daughter inside to console her and sat on the couch trying to make her feel better. My wife came and sat next to me and I told her that I would like to be the one to make my daughter feel better as my daughter was very attached to me at the moment, so my wife rejoined the group.


After a couple of minutes with my kid, and me trying to make sense of what had happened, I grew very angry and resentful. I went outside and forcefully told the couple, ""you need to go, now."" No cursing, no yelling, just authoritatively giving a command. My friend made a pretty weak apology, and his wife said, ""he's sorry he pinched you, but you shouldn't hit."" To which I responded, ""doesn't matter, she's only 3 years old."" The couple then packed up their kids and their belongings and left my house.


Here are the issues I am contending with now:

    My wife is upset that I made a unilateral decision to kick them out. She agrees that what my friend did was wrong, but didn't like how I ended the BBQ. I think she's very concerned about the friendship, where I, quite honestly, am OK with ending it unless some serious amends occur.

    Can the friendship be salvaged? I'm thinking my friend would need to apologize to me and my daughter, and we would have to set ground rules on correcting the behavior of our respective kids. Personally, I would never physically discipline any child that isn't mine, and I would be very cautious to even scold a child unless it was something very serious or dangerous.

    Did I make the right decision kicking them out basically immediately after what transpired?

It was a very sucky thing to happen, especially on fathers day. I too would be sad if the friendship was over, but I'm the protector of my family. In my mind, something like this should never ever have happened.

Tl;dr Husband has walked out last week and has not been heard from since children are heartbroken. 

I gave birth to a beautiful baby boy in January who was sadly born asleep, me and my husband have been married 3 years and have always had a rocky relationship due to trust issues. 

A few weeks after our son passed we had a particularly nasty argument which proceeded in him threatening to kill me and one of my neighbours phoning the police. He was let off with a warning but have had social services involvement ever since, last week it all came to a head and after this latest screaming match he left and we have not heard from him since, despite myself and my daughter (5) ringing and texting him (daughter has her own iPad to ring him) we have not heard a peep, he has been putting money in my bank for food for the children but nothing else. 

I believe our grief has consumed us and broken us maybe beyond repair, we had counselling booked for last Tuesday but obviously we didn’t go. I just feel so heartbroken, his a good man and a great dad and I love him very much. I can’t eat or sleep I just cry and I have consumed far too much wine just to try and get through, I have even contemplated suicide but could not leave my children, I just don’t know what to do anymore. I understand him not wanting to be with me (I have some mental health issues I struggle with daily) but to cut the children off and leave me to explain to my crying daughter why her daddy won’t speak to her (she thinks she has done something wrong for him to not want her) even though I’ve assured her it’s not her fault at all, but it’s devastating. Please I just need some help any advice is welcome and please ask if you have any questions or want more information. I’m just a mess."
50,"My husband wants to be my assistant and a stay at home dad. Should I take him up on the offer?


My husband (30m) and I (30f) have been together for 5 years and we have a 3 year old daughter and I’m currently pregnant with our son. He is highly educated (he has a masters degree plus an industry qualification which is equivalent to a PhD) he had a good job with a good income which he resigned from to move to my state as we were previously long-distance. He has the potential to earn 150-200k a year. However he hates his chosen career path (high stress, competitive, emotionally unfulfilling). He loves taking care of me (cooking for me, doing little tasks and chores for me, giving me massages) and spending time with our daughter (he’s a great dad). He also told me (after some apprehension) that he has always wanted to be a stay at home dad. His words (paraphrasing) “I love seeing you happy, and doing things for you, it gives me an almost spiritual level of fulfilment”

 After my daughter was born, I left my office job to become a bit of a mompreneur. My business is making modest profits but not enough to sustain our current lifestyle . My husband has been incredibly supportive amd encouraging and he thinks that my business has the potential to be huge, He takes care of the finance / legal side of things. He wants me to give me a couple of years to fully focus on my business (as in 50 plus hours a week) to build it up while he takes care of everything else. If it works out, he wants to be a full time stay at home dad permanently as well as my assistant. If it doesn’t work out, he said he will go back to work to support the family. We have savings (liquidated investments) to live on for two years.

 I think it’s amazing that he wants to take a chance on me, but it’s a huge responsibility . Two years is a big gap in his career, and we both come from very traditional families (both our mothers were SAHMs), so I don’t know how this our change our relationship dynamic. My business was a fun side project, I’m also nervous about depending on it for income. On the other hand, it will be good to have him around full time to help with the newborn baby, I work from home as well, so it will be good to spend more time with him

Tl;dr my husband wants to take a break from his successful career to be a stay at home dad. Will this be good for our marriage and future?"
51,"I (F29) have a much higher sex drive than my gf (F26), and she's told me to look for someone else to sleep with.


I'm just gonna write this quickly - 

been together 2 years - sex was great the beginning

over the past year its slowed right down - now it's once a month at the most

GF has never had much interest in sex - she openly expressed that she doesn't understand why people feel the need it, and that she has never had much sexual desire. 

I am the opposite, sex is super important for me in a relationship. and the lack of sex in this relationship is making me quite frustrated.

My gf told me to look for someone else to satisfy my needs - she told me she can't see the situation changing anytime soon and she knows its something that I feel i need.

Despite her offering this solution, I can't help but feeling selfish for wanting to have more sex in my life.

&amp;#x200B;

I much prefer sleeping with someone that I love and trust, but i feel i'm constantly waiting for her to make a move on me. I feel like she's taking away my ability to be/act sexual - like, I feel like I can never make the first move because i know 9 times out of 10, it will be a no.

I really miss exploring this side of myself.

&amp;#x200B;

So, i guess my question is am i being selfish for wanting more sex in my life? 

Any advice would be appreciated, thanks!

TL;DR

my sex drive is much higher than my gf's, she told me to find someone else to have sex with.. am I being selfish? Should i just be satisfied with what I have and keep waiting for my gf."
52,"My fiancé (31F) isn’t sure she still wants to marry me (35M) after having a miscarriage.


We found out she was pregnant in February. I already had a ring before we found out, and proposed in March as I’d originally planned. She miscarried in April. No obvious complications, her doctor said she’s fine and still healthy enough to have children, it was just nature’s way. Dealing with the loss has been tough for each of us, but I never questioned our relationship. All of a sudden, seemingly out of the blue, she said she probably doesn’t want to try to ever get pregnant, that she still loves me but doesn’t see the point in getting married now, and says it isn’t fair to me that I’d be giving up on some of my dreams (marriage and children). Marriage and children were never dealbreakers for me, and I’d told her this. My first choice has always been spending my life with her no matter what the circumstances. No one has ever made me feel as happy and as much “myself” as she does. But now it feels like everything is up in the air and she’s having a hard time even seeing what the point of being in a relationship is. Any advice?

TLDR: Even though she says she loves me, my fiancé isn’t sure she wants to continue our relationship after having a miscarriage."
53,"I (19f) am accidentally in a relationship


I (19f) made friends online with a woman (30f) who I'll call Emily. We have some similar interests and started chatting about a particular TV show in December last year. She told me quite soon after we started talking that she had a crush on me; I'm bi and she's a lesbian but I wasn't interested romantically and made that clear but also made it clear that I was happy to just be friends with her. She didn't bring it up again and as far as I was concerned we were pretty good friends. 

Then at one point recently, she told me in the course of a conversation that I made her happy and I said something along the lines of ""that's nice, you make me happy too"", which is something I would say to any of my friends. However, Emily responded with (I'm paraphrasing) ""oh my God, really? I do? That's amazing, I'm so happy!"" which I didn't think much of at the time as she tends to be quite enthusiastic in her manner of speaking. Then a few days later in a different conversation, I said something like ""that's what friends are for"" and she said ""yeah, friends, or whatever we are to each other"". This made me vaguely uncomfortable at the time but as she didn't say anything else, I convinced myself that it didn't mean anything; I think part of this is also me having very low self-esteem so I find it difficult to believe that people actually like me at all, let alone romantically. I'm not excusing myself but I do think that is why I didn't face up to the situation until it was too late. 

A short while after that, I was talking with her about one of her favourite actresses and made some joke about how good this actress would be in bed; it was definitely sexual but again, it was a conversation I would have with most of my other friends without thinking anything of it. However, Emily responded by saying she had to masturbate and then a few minutes later, informed me that I had made her come. From that point on, she seemed to assume that we were in a relationship and immediately started sending me nudes, sexually explicit texts and physical presents to my home address (which I'd previously given her after I gave her the money to buy me some merch available at a con she attended). 

I had and have no romantic or sexual attraction to her but through a combination of social anxiety, cowardice and low self-esteem, I went along with it. She'd also gone into detail about having no self-esteem after being broken up with before and frequently (like every day) talks about how she doesn't know how she'd go on if I broke up with her, which definitely contributed to me not wanting to upset her. 
My attitude was and still is that I should be grateful that anyone wants to be in a relationship with me but I can't take do it anymore. 

She's also recently told me that she's been in more than one online relationship with girls who were quite a bit younger than her, one when the girl was 15 and she was 26, which makes me look at her less favourably and feel less guilty about hurting her. She's also repeatedly sent me presents even though I've very seriously asked her to stop several times and tells me she's in love with me every day and pesters me to say it back even though I have told her repeatedly that I'm still figuring out whether I'm even capable of romantic attraction.

I'm aware that this is my fault and wouldn't have happened if I could just speak up and tell the truth but I just need some advice on how to make a clean break without hurting her too much. 

Tl;dr: Was too scared to reject an online friend who assumed we were in a romantic relationship. How do I let her down gently?"
54,"How can I (40sF) tell my good friend (40sF) I don't want to hang out because her kids are intolerable?


Throwaway because some people involved are on reddit.

I have a best girl friend who has two kids (ages 5 and 8).  My husband and I are childfree by choice.  I don't get to hang out with my girl friend as much nowadays but we get together every couple of weeks for dinner or drinks or whatnot.

The problem is she keeps asking me to hang out with her and her kids for things like daytrips, etc. I prefer to hang out with just her so we can visit and catch up.  But the bigger issue is that her kids are absolute terrors. It is not my place to comment or give her advice - I don't even have kids of my own and I can't imagine how difficult parenting is.  I have been around high maintenance children, but this is an entirely different level - the kids make a scene everywhere we go, and she 100% focuses on them the entire time so it's not really even hanging out with her and it's also very uncomfortable.

The thing is that we have some mutual friends with kids who I have hung out with before - with their kids - and their kids are behaved and it's a different type of experience.  So my good friend knows I hang out with this friend - and their kids roughly the same age - and wonders why I never accept invites to hang out with her with her kids in tow.

I can't just say ""well, your kids are brats and it's miserable hanging out with you"" because that would be deeply offensive, and I do feel that I am not one to judge. But it's night and day what the experiences are hanging out with these two friends based on their parenting style.

I also don't want to stop hanging around with my girl friend with the behaved kids because she doesn't have babysitting as often so I would not see her much at all if she didn't bring her kids.  When she brings her kids they don't impact our ability to talk and catch up, whereas the other friend is the opposite - if her kids are present, the entire time is spent managing their meltdowns.

Any advice would be so appreciated!!

TL;DR: How do I tell a good friend I don't want to hang around with her and her kids because they are terrors without offending her because I do spend time with other friends and their kids regularly?"
55,"My (23F) boyfriend’s (26M) ex is upset that she wasn’t updated on us becoming official. Am I the only one who finds this weird?


My boyfriend told me that his ex was upset after seeing us together the other day because she wasn’t aware that we were official.

I told him that it seemed suspicious. He said that she is currently dating someone else and only wanted our relationship update for gossip. (what)

He also told me that she probably still has feelings for him, but that they would never work out or get back together. I asked him if he still has feelings for her, to which he replied yes, but only as respect and because she was a person he loved at one point in his life.

I’m rationalizing all of this in my head, but I just wanted to know if there is anything that I should be worried about/look out for. Thanks.

The TL;DR of my last post was that my fiancé didn't want me going on walks by myself because I have uncontrolled epilepsy and I felt super trapped.   


First, I just wanted to thank everyone for your thoughtful comments-I took them all to heart and read them through and brought up some of them with my fiancé. It really helped.   


The night after my post, we had a long talk and came to a compromise. I got a location tracking app called Life 360 and guys, the first few times I went on walks by myself I was NERVOUS. I hadn't been out anywhere on my own in YEARS so it was a really big step for me. I did have some issues with overstimulation at first when routes weren't exactly clear. Now we're at the point that I don't need to tell him if I'm going out. Overall he's become much more comfortable with me doing it-I'm going whenever I want and oftentimes he's in meetings that time of day I go so I know he's not tracking me. And he got the app too-it's loaded with features like showing your speeds, how many times you use the phone etc. It's actually helping him be a better driver.   


We're also going on more walks together; I'm cooking more and baking again. I do only BBQ when he's around and actually next to me because some of the people in the last post with epilepsy told me to stay away from them.   


But now we've come across a bit of an issue.   
 I've discovered people have a nasty habit of running through lights, stop signs, etc. the first two blocks in either direction outside our building. A person got ran over crossing the street last week, and I'm sad to learn that this isn't the first time this has happened. It makes me question getting a dog but I'm hoping that if I just stick to low traffic times of day and don't bother crossing if there's any cars at all then I'll be alright. Thoughts?   


\*\*TL;DR\*\* I'm ""allowed"" to do what I want to do. Our relationship is in a fantastic place and I'm feeling much more confident doing normal things again."
57,"My (30F) SO (27M) won't let me backpack by myself through Europe, despite me already having done so for over 10 years


*TLDR: SO has anxiety over me backpacking by myself, despite the fact that I've already lived, worked, and backpacked in these places before*


When I was 19 years old, the summer after high school, I emptied out my savings and moved to Berlin. No job, no address, just enough money to cover 2 months of rent for the flat of a friend of a friends aunt or something. I scraped together a few part-time jobs, slept on a park bench once or twice, but eventually got a job as a bartender at a wonderful, now defunct lesbian bar. 1 year after that, I skipped town, moved to Spain, and did it all again. Most of my early 20's involved moving around, working all kinds of bars and clubs, and my fair share of rough living, including brief periods of homelessness. There was also a lot of backpacking in between, and I'm happy to say that I've not only visited (and revisited) every country in Europe, but I've been picking off countries all over the map at a pretty steady pace.

When I turned 27, I decided to be formally trained as a sommelier. I ended up meeting my current SO, and agreed to move to England with him. As of 2019, we've settled down into a shared flat, and I've been working at my latest job for about 9 months now where the dress code is flexible and the staff is amazing. 

My vacation starts in about a week and lasts until early august, a few weeks before we reopen after the summer. The plan was a 60/40 split between us blowing money at Italian agriturismos and getting wine drunk, and me then travelling to Germany, France, and Austria by a mix of bus and train so that I can meet some of my old friends and revisit some of the places where I used to work and live (and also I get to wear a backpack).

My SO graciously offered to handle the bookings, even my own, which I was both surprised and grateful for since it's a pain. 

I was even more surprised when he told me yesterday that he actually hadn't booked anything for me, and also that I shouldn't go. 

He told me that he was going to book it, but the idea of me travelling all by myself made him so anxious that he wanted to throw up. He said that travelling alone as a woman when you're in a relationship was reckless, selfish, ""and just asking for it."" And since I was backpacking, it was also obnoxious. 

I was too angry to reply, but also too angry to fight, so I just kind of left it at that and slept on the couch instead. We haven't spoken since then, and I'm currently sitting outside after closing and hovering with my finger over the ""book"" button. 

Is he overreacting or am I just being selfish? I get being worried but I really feel like I've proven that I'm more than capable of taking care of myself."
58,"My gf's (25F) family won't accept me (27M) unless I convert to Judaism.


I'm going to apologize up front because this is going to be a mess. 

&amp;#x200B;

We have been dating for over five years. My girlfriend (let's call her g) is a Conservative Jew and I don't have a religion. My parents were Christian as children, but raised me without religion. We still celebrate the Christian holidays, without all of the religious context, as a time for friends and family. G doesn't consider herself religious, but Judaism is a big part of the culture she was raised in and the traditions she follows. I love that about her, I like learning about and participating in the the traditions that have shaped her life and she does the same for me. Our relationship is great. We're both happily in love and haven't had any issues that we weren't able to talk through and come out better for in the end, except for one major problem, her family.

In the five years that we have been dating, I have been to G's house (while her family was there) once. When we first started dating I didn't mind too much. We are both very busy people. G works part time and is in her final year of law school and I work full time as a programmer while finishing a bachelor's degree.

The issue stems from her step-father, let's call him D and her mother, J. D comes from an Orthodox Jewish family. It was a major point of contention for D's family when he married J because she was Conservative and not Orthodox, they pressured him to get her and her daughters to convert. D did not convert. Because of this, D's family has always treated my girlfriend and her sisters with disdain, often avoiding all contact at family events. One member of D's family said this is because ""love has boundaries"".  On top of family issues, D is a difficult person to be around because he rarely ever takes responsibility for anything. Everything is always someone else's fault. Unfortunately, this seems to be a trait he passed down to his three children, G's step-siblings. G often describes that she feels like a second class citizen in her own home. 

When D found out about me, he feigned ignorance, but started treating G as his family did, avoiding her, but also finding minor things to get annoyed with her about to start an argument, but not once did he acknowledge that he was acting that way because he knew about me, almost like he was playing a game with her. Meanwhile, my family invited G in with open arms. I felt pressured to make up lies to my family about going over to G's house to make it seem like everything was normal. G and I have had numerous discussions on how we should work on the situation. The most promising route seemed to be getting her mother's support. However, J never wanted to talk about it. J knew that if D found out that she was discussing and approving of me without his consent he would be furious. Their relationship was already bad enough as it was, J didn't want to have to face another divorce. Out of G's entire family, only her two blood related sisters seemed supportive of our relationship, they are both very nice to me and invite G and I to go out and do things.

However, since I was never invited over to G's parent's house for anything, I could only imagine how bad the situation was until I experienced it indirectly . My mother passed away from breast cancer last September. G was amazing during this time and supported me and my family tremendously. She put together picture boards for the viewing, brought us food, helped keep the house clean and never left my side. When G asked her mother to come to the viewing for her, she initially said yes, but seemed incredibly apprehensive. When the day of the viewing came, it took repeated phone calls from G's sisters, but she eventually came. This moment was extremely awkward because I didn't know what to say, but she was genuinely polite. She didn't stay long, but it was a Jewish holiday and so she had to get back to finish cooking before everyone came over. I had hoped this would be a turning point, but as it turns out, J never told D where she went that day.

Fast forward to a couple of weeks ago. G had been staying at my place every weekend for a few months. One day while G was still home, D confronted J about why G was never around  and why she hadn't been participating in the family events (he knew about me, but still continued to play dumb). J finally stood up for G and ""revealed"" where she had been. D acted surprised and hurt and played the victim, feeling upset and even asking why G wasn't there for that specific September  holiday. When J told D that my mother died and that G was at her funeral he again tried to turn it around to play the victim and pretend he didn't hear or didn't care (I'm not sure which, the sheer craziness of the remark gets me fuming) he said something along the lines of, ""So she didn't come to \_\_\_\_\_ because she was at his party?"" A PARTY! Funeral and party sound nothing alike, but I'm getting off track. None of this was said to G, she was just within earshot of the argument.

The news traveled fast. Soon, G's step siblings were discussing her ""secret"" relationship and started texting her asking to talk, basically demanding that she explain herself. At first G refused, but then she conceded that she would talk, but only in the presence of a professional counselor. The step siblings acknowledged that a professional would be great, but that it would be hard to schedule something so soon and that they should at least get together to have a discussion among siblings. G had a feeling that no one was going to listen to her and never agreed to go, but went anyway. I was not invited. It went exactly as G predicted. G was told that they only way that I would be accepted into the family was if I converted. If I didn't convert and G chose to be with me, she wouldn't be invited to any more family events. One of G's step sisters tried to manipulate by telling her that her son (G's 4 year old nephew) never got to see her and kept asking ""Where's G"" when they were over at their parents' house (playing the victim). They said that if D and J were to get divorced, it would be G's fault because she divided the family by choosing to be with me. 

I picked G up from her house afterwards, she had taken a Xanax (a doctor prescribed dose to deal with anxiety) and I had to help her get into the car after she had vomited on the pavement. She fell asleep until around noon today and didn't get to tell me anything about what happened until she called me while I was out for lunch. So here I am typing this at work, distraught and angry. I really don't want G to lose her family because of me so I'm seriously considering the conversion. On the other hand, I don't know that me converting will change anything. G's family obviously has some issues that they are refusing to acknowledge, when and how will they show up next? Will her family look down on me for being a convert? Will they treat G poorly because of it? If i did convert, I would have to go through a lengthy process including classes to eventually be approved, all just for a label. I will never be a true believer or a real Jew and why should I be forced to change who I am as a person to be with the person that loves me as I am? I love G as she is. I want her to be Jewish and to share her traditions with me just as she takes on mine. My family sees this, why can't hers? Is it selfish for me to not want to convert? Our other solution is to just move out ASAP and start our own life together, but again, I don't want her to be excommunicated from her family. What do I do?

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR : My girlfriend's (of 5 years) family has issues and instead of admitting them, prefers to point fingers and blame others.  They refuse to acknowledge me unless I convert to Judaism and if I don't, my girlfriend will be excluded from events and blamed for dividing the family. However, there is no guarantee that they will accept me even if I do convert."
59,"My [20s F] landlord [50s F] went through the garbage and called me to vent at me for ""disposing incorrectly."" She IDd me through prescription medication labels and I feel super freaked out and violated.


Live in an apartment building, landlord lives onsite. She has always been a little nosy, but harmless. She also has a *way* with passive-aggressive signgage, so much so that there are usually 2 or 3 signs at doors and elevators that get changed up frequently.

Apparently, she put some new sign up today instructing tenants to use the bins by the curb. Anyway, I didn't notice this specific sign in this sea of signs about why all tenants are garbage themselves for the ways in which they dispose, and I was only made aware of it when my LL (who lives next to the front door) called me the moment I got home to go off on me about this. She even asked ""Why would you do that?"" as though putting your garbage in your usual garbage bin is utterly incomprehensible.

I was stunned by the nerve of this and just said I would pay better attention to the signs next time. That said, I've sat with it, and I'm really not happy with this. Unless she's been watching me, she identified me by labels on mental health medications. The bag also had personal items which I did not want seen by someone who is not my partner (which is exactly why they were going to the bin!), and that my landlord has now helped herself to all this material and not only that, sees nothing wrong with calling to say hey, I've just been rifling through your trash like a raccoon, an activity which I believe is totally normal, sup?, I'm feeling just fully freaked out. I normally don't have any issues asserting myself, but I've had bad experiences with people in positions of power who are this blind to the faults of their own actions. Scares me senseless that if she thinks this is NBD, what else is going to be once I piss her off by voicing my concerns? She can make my life hell.

At the same time, the items were so intensely personal -- *and she's digging through the goddamn garbage* -- so I feel like something needs to be communicated here. I am not sure exactly what or how.

And no, I'm not moving, it's a great apartment and the market here is a nightmare. Not telling her to fuck right off for the same reason.

TL;DR: My goal is to continue living peacefully at my apartment after my landlord has gone through my trash, discovered personal health information and other fun stuff, and bothered me at home to be needlessly rude to me about it.

For the record, I'm an environmentalist and I reduce, rinse, and sort every last freaking scrap I dispose of. I'm probably one of the few tenants who does based on the looks of things. So it is not that I put garbage in recycling or something, which should be corrected - I put my garbage in a bin she would prefer not to be used right now and is pissed I didn't catch her 67th visually identical sign."
60,"My Boyfriend (30) seems classist, am I (25) overreacting?



Ok so I have my Master's degree in electrical and computer engineering from a pretty amazing school, and I'm working at a robotics and automation company.  We're doing some large scale stuff right now, and a decent part of my job recently has been working hands on, wiring stuff, hands on testing of things i designed, etc. The stuff were doing is big and potentially dangerous enough that everyone needs protective boots, hard hats, electrical protective gloves, and other stuff. I tend to get dirty at work, greasy, sweaty, whatever. 

I like that part of my job way more than the time I spend sitting in an office designing something, it's really cool to see stuff come alive. And I get restless sitting for too long.

And for the longest time, I thought my boyfriend found my job really cool too. At least he was really impressed by my education...

----

But something weird happened today, my boyfriend was having a casual after-work meetup with some of his new work friends at a bar. They all work in the medical field FYI. The bar was a fairly divey place, with outdoor picnic tables, I didn't think my work clothes would be out of place there at all. 

So I met up with everyone, I hadn't met most of these people before. My boyfriend introduced me and one of his friends asked what I do, I said that I was on the electrical team at (automation company). He asked how my day was, and I mentioned it had been pretty sweet, I'd been up on the boom lift for a lot of the afternoon and it was a beautiful summer day for that. I said that kind of offhand, not thinking a thing of it.

The conversation moved on, and I had a pretty good time. I got to talking with some of my boyfriend's coworkers about hunting, which I did a lot as a kid but haven't recently. And about off-roading, which I really enjoy. We talked about cars some, sharing stories about our terrible first cars. I mentioned that I still have my terrible first car, and even though it's objectively shit, I've become kind of attached to it. Too many good memories in that thing to sell it before it finally dies on me.

----

After the night out, I felt like I'd made a pretty good impression. Seemed like the guys liked talking about cars with me, they all seemed like chill laid back types I could get on well with.

To my surprise, my boyfriend thought the opposite. He asked me why I was pretending to be ""in the trades"" and why I'd mainly talked about ""redneck shit"" like hunting and off-roading and beater cars.

I was astounded. Everything I said about my job was true, I wasn't deliberately trying to downplay it. I do work for (automation company), I am on the electrical team, and I had spent the afternoon up on the boom lift. 

It isn't like me to introduce myself like ""I'm an electrical engineer, I have my bachelor's from (good college) and my Master's from (prestigious college) and I'm working on (super boring technical stuff) today!""

Also, about hunting and cars... I don't talk about that stuff much because I haven't found many people in the city who are into that sort of stuff. But that's stuff I enjoy, and was happy to find people to talk about it with...

But even after I explained it all, my boyfriend told me that I need to be more thoughtful of the impression I give, I made myself look ""trashy and dumber than I am"" by how I presented myself.

That honestly felt very insulting to hear. Even if I was in the trades, and hunting every weekend, there's nothing wrong with that. There are loads of cool people I know and work with who got into a trade rather than going to college. They're worth just as much respect as I am, (obviously), and it felt like my boyfriend was implying otherwise...

I don't know if I'm majorly overthinking things, but I feel like he showed an ugly side and I'm not so sure how to feel. 

tl;dr - my boyfriend said some stuff that made me wonder if he's sort of classist, it seems like he looks down on people who are ""rednecks"" or didn't go to college"
61,"i (20f) am helping some friends (24m, 20f) by taking care of their dog while they’re out of town and i found something disturbing.


some friends of mine are taking a little getaway this weekend and have asked me to watch their dog. i absolutely adore their dog and was thrilled to take them up on it. 

i stopped by this morning to give her some breakfast and let her out and hang out with her a while and nothing seemed off. she was just as cuddly and excited and sweet as usual. my friends usually leave her in the basement while they’re at work and had instructed me to do the same. so, after i fed her and gave her water, i let her out one last time before letting her go back downstairs until i could come back. 

the second time i dropped by, i started to feel like something was off. she seemed fine, but she wouldn’t go to the bathroom despite having had a lot to eat and drink that morning. so, i went downstairs to make sure she didn’t have an accident. 

last weekend, my friends had hosted a birthday party and set up beer pong in the basement. the table was still set up, and there were dozens of destroyed solo cups littering the floor. there was a broken beer bottle, as well, and at least a dozen piles of dog poop that had to have been there for several days. there was also a pretty big puddle of dog pee in the middle of the room. that means for six days this poor dog has been sleeping in her own filth along with broken glass and shredded plastic cups.

i have no idea what to do about this. i’m pretty stunned, to be honest, and have lost pretty much all respect for the both of them. i have absolutely no idea where to go from here. 

tl;dr some friends i was dog-sitting for left her downstairs for six days without cleaning up their own mess or her dozens of accidents. i don’t think i’m supposed to even know."
62,"My [27M] father [62M] is dying with cancer and my mother [53F] is angry at me for not being sad.


I am using a throwaway account for obvious reasons. Sorry if the english is bad, as it's not my first languages.

A bit of background information. My father and mother are of chinese origins, and we moved to an european country right around when i was two years old. I have 2 sisters, one which is 3 years younger than me, and one that is 10 years younger than me.

&amp;#x200B;

My father was never a good man. One of the earliest memories I have, is from when i was 2 and a half years old, from when my first sister was born. Like many children around that age, I was not happy with getting a sister, as the attention from my mother would be shared with someone else than me. As a result of this, to get more attention, I remember i started to do things to get more attention, one of them was dismantelig a clock and try to put it back together. This episode is the first time i remember my father hitting me. I still have visible scars on my hands and back to this day.

&amp;#x200B;

Fast forwards a few years, me and my sister becomes quite good friends. However, anything we do in the light of our fathers eyes was wrong, and we would often get punished physically (involving being hit by a belt and similar experiences). We used to get threatened to be kicked out of the house of the age of twelve, and one time, during a visit to a town 3 hours from home, we got left alone by a resting spot in the middle of nowhere near a highway, because me and my sister was asking when we would be there. After about half an hour, our mother convinced him to turn back to pick us up again.

&amp;#x200B;

After a certain point as a teenager, the physical abuse stopped, but the emotional abuse continued. At the age of 19, I left home to attend to the university, but I would still come home during the holidays. During one holiday, a situation where my father would hit my mother in the face appeared. It was during this incident it was enough for me. I tackled him, and beat him up, while my mother and sister tried to stop me. This is not the first time my father has hit my mother, and how she is still together with him is something i cant understand .(She says that she owes it to him, since he brought her out of her homecountry). After this incident, i stopped to come home whatsoever, and had no contact with him. However, I am still in contact with my mother and sisters.

&amp;#x200B;

Today, i received a phonecall from my mother about my father. He had been dianosticated with lung carcinoma. At this point, I havent seen or talked to the man in about 5 years. My mother told me he wants to become friends with me again before he passes away. I have no intentions of doing this. At first, when I heard the news, I felt nothing, but now, as I am realizing he is going to die pretty soon, I am ecstatic. I havent been so happy in a long time, and I actually hope he gets a slow and painful death.

&amp;#x200B;

Now the issue is that my mother is starting to be angry at me for not showing any affection or sadness of receiving theese news. I think she is acting ridiculous and frankly I am offended that she cant let me feel whatever i want to feel. Any thoughts on how to handle the situation?  


tl;dr abusing father is finally dying of cancer, and I thinks that what goes around, comes around. Mother is angry at me for feeling this way."
63,"My [28F] partner [also 28F] of 8 years has dyspraxia and makes a lot of I-Love-Lucy-types of mistakes. I know it's not deliberate carelessness and try to be understanding but if I point something out she becomes upset and accuses me of ""harping."" I don't know how to point things out without harping.


For instance, we have a dog we really love and a lot of the goof-ups involve him potentially being endangered. She often opens the door and isn't paying attention to how close he is to the door, and he occasionally escapes and will try to run out into the road. So I installed a baby gate between our door and the porch so he can't get out when she opens the door. She opens the gate, but forgets to close it, making the gate pointless. This has happened a few times and today I finally said something about it, in a nice tone: ""Hey honey, you're forgetting to keep the baby gate closed and I don't want him to get out."" She immediately went from pleasant to agitated and accused me of ""harping"" on her.

The other day she almost let him out again and I said ""please watch him he's about to charge the door."" Instead of watching the door she again accused me of ""harping"" and he almost got out.

95% of the time, when she goofs up with something, I don't say anything and just quietly fix it because I don't want her to be self-conscious. But when the 5% of the time comes that I DO say something because it's a persistent issue and I don't want someone to get hurt, she jumps on me for ""harping"" on her. I understand it's probably really freaking frustrating to feel like your partner is following you around parenting you (unless that's your thing) but I feel like if I didn't someone would get hurt. I would rather hurt her feelings than see her get physically injured (such as the time she had her laptop plugged into the wall and was using it next to the bath).

Is there an appropriate way I can alert her to an issue without harping? I probably DO harp, she doesn't pay attention to things but I pay *too* much attention and am *too* alert. I probably point something out 2-3 times a day. I'm still being totally serious when I say that I'm only pointing out 5% of the things I come across. Unless it's dangerous, I just fix it (like food being left out, I'll just put it away etc.).

\*\*tl;dr\*\* Partner has dyspraxia and often doesn't pay attention to her surroundings. When I point something out because I'm worried someone's going to get hurt, she accuses me of ""harping"" and I need a way to point things out without harping on her."
64,"Should we get the surgery for my daughter or not?


Hi guys. So I have a severely disabled little girl (8). She is confined to a wheelchair, is non verbal, has a severe developmental delay and is blind. 


We are struggling with her as she gets bigger, because obviously it's getting harder to carry her about. She is also getting a lot stronger, and is generally a handful.


We have an option to apply for surgery that will essentially stop her from going through puberty. But I'm so conflicted.


I think she would have a better life without having to deal with periods and puberty in general. But I still feel as if I'm doing something wrong. Like, I'm forcing her to miss out on something?


I'm so stuck. I want the best for her, but my heart doesn't know what would be best. If we went ahead with this, is it more for our ease or her ease?


I've discussed it at great length with a few people. We know for a fact that she could never have consensual sex, so it would be cruel for her to become an adult and have those needs without ever having gratification. Also, the risk of abuse would become a lot higher (as horrible as it is to think about) if she does fully develop. I know that this is something we should think through and decide as a family, but I just want to make sure that I'm seeing all sides of things before we make any decisions that we can't go back on.


In these situations, drs normally put the child on the pill to help deal with the periods etc etc. This is not an option, as I have a blood clotting disorder, which makes her high risk for having it too. So no hormones are allowed in either of our bodies. I also have a terrible time with my periods, and it's likely she will suffer the same way I do (I'm actually waiting on surgery myself). I also have PCOS, which means she has a risk for that too.


The treatment we are looking at having done is called The Ashley Treatment if you want to Google it. I'm just at a loss on what to do. People dont know this, but mentally impaired children tend to start puberty earlier, so time is becoming a factor. I had early onset puberty as well, so it doubles up how soon this could start. She is already 8 years old, which means if we do go ahead, we have to start getting the ball rolling.


I'm not looking for people to start a fight with me over this, genuinely looking for advice. I just didnt know where else to turn. Thanks.

Tl;dr- should we consent to age stopping surgery for our disabled daughter?"
65,"My [17M] best friend says she has feelings for me and wants to be with me, but she talks to other guys and gets jealous if I talk with other girls?!


I [17M] met my beat friend Dani [21F] one year ago. At the time, she was dating someone, then they broke up like 3 months after I met her. We’ve been close since and I really do like her, it’s just hard to deal with this. So, she has been telling me how much she likes me and loves me, then I slept with her and she said that she wants to be with me. The thing is, she talks with a lot of other guys, and she gets extremelly jealous if I talk with other girls. Let me give an example for clarification. 

A few days ago, we were hanging out in my group of friends. She saw some random guy, then she told me that he was cute. I really don’t know why she told me, then she said she was gonna go talk to him and she did. Then she came back and kept rubbing in my face that she had given him her number. I was a bit upset, but I can’t control her or force her into anything so I just acted cool and normal. Then she kept trying to “point out” “cute guys” to me and she would just keep doing that. Then the next day we were out in public and I met a new female friend.

The girl was flirty with me, but I just talked with her normal and she asked for my social media. Dani came up to me and started to act all nice with me and got super huggy and touchy with me while I was trying to talk with my new friend. After we left, she got pissed at me. She said what was my fcking problem and she said she couldn’t believe and went as far as asking me if I really even cared about her. 

Then she went on my phone and started to go through my messages with girls and she asked me why I had so many friends who were girls. What the fck? I got kind of mad at her and I didn’t text her for 2 days and she started to spam my phone until I answered. I talked with her again and she started acting super nice and she kept telling me she loved me and wanted me to just give her a chance but all she does is mess with my feelings. What am I supposed to do? I really do like her, but I can’t be with her if all she’s going to do is play with my feelings.

TL;DR My close friend says she wants to be with me but flirts around with other guys. She gets mad if I even look in the direction of another girl and I am not sure what I should do"
66,"My (36m) wife (32f) cheated on me and we are trying to work it out, but I feel like she's wildly insensitive.


Married 5 years with a toddler. I'll say right upfront her actions seriously hurt my self-esteem, ability to trust and overall wellbeing. I'm not sure she understands how badly.

&amp;#x200B;

We were definitely going through a rough patch which likely stemmed from many things (her sister was sick in the hospital for months, many issues at her place of employment, she had quit drinking last year so that coping mechanism was gone). I tried to be supportive, but she was very angry and often turned her anger towards me. I felt like I couldn't do anything right half the time.

&amp;#x200B;

In the past, we've had issues where she would text a male co-worker too much. I didn't like this because it seemed to take up too much of her free time, and I also felt it was bordering on an emotional affair. She stopped it and we got past it (but it did put a dent in my trust for her).

&amp;#x200B;

Once again, I noticed she was texting some guy from facebook. I asked her if I could read their texts and she claimed that she had deleted them....not because they were inappropriate but because she panicked knowing I'd be angry she was texting him to begin with. We fought over that and that's where things went south.

&amp;#x200B;

I didn't communicate well I admit, and I angrily told her if she continued texting him I wanted a divorce. All she got from that was that I ""wanted a divorce"". Our relationship became strained, but we still were together. We still had sex (although rarely at that point) and acted as a couple. Apparently while this was going on, she decided I was a jerk for even mentioning divorce and she started meeting up with texting-guy for sex in his car (at least 6 times). I had no idea.

&amp;#x200B;

Things ended between them and then on a fluke I found out. At first she denied it, but eventually admitted everything.  I was BLINDSIDED badly. I went into a depression where I couldn't cope. I took a 3 week leave of absence from work and stayed with my brother.

&amp;#x200B;

I eventually moved back (my wife was very remorseful and wanted another chance).

&amp;#x200B;

**However.....**.she makes little jokes, little quips about things to ""lighten the mood"". It isn't lightening the mood for me at all. Instead it's like a knife in the gut. For example, we'll be talking about something to do with getting a new car and how much space it has, and she'll say *""well, you know I know all about how much space is in the backseat of cars""*.  Then she'll see my face freeze and she'll say ""*Come on! I'm joking!!*""  This has happened many times since I've been back. Am I just being crazy and over sensitive? It has only been 4 months since I found out about the affair. I don't find it funny at all, and I've told her. She doesn't seem to understand that these ""jokes"" aren't funny, don't lighten the mood, and in fact hurt me.  Another horrible aspect of this affair is that she told me he gave her money and gifts, so she said he was practically like a ""sugar daddy"" and there was no love on either side.  Today she accidentally added more sugar than she meant to her coffee, and she said ""*jeez, now I'm a REAL sugar baby""*.

&amp;#x200B;

Am I reading too much into this and looking for problems? Please tell me because I feel like I'm going crazy.

&amp;#x200B;

**TLDR: wife had an affair, we agreed to try to make things work, but her little jokes about the affair are really not funny to me and upset me a lot.**"
67,"My (19M) Dad(51M) thinks I'm having intercourse or in love with my Mom.


Ok so ever since I got back home from I've been helping my mom at her flower shop. Since she works alone it can get boring and I can do the labor.

Things go well for a few weeks my Mom is really happy that I'm taking the time out of my summer to help her. My Dad seemed proud of me at first too but then things starting getting fucking weird.

To make it simple here's a list of weird thing my Dad is asking/tells me:

- Asks me if I would ever marry a woman like my mom

-Tells me how sex is the worst sin

-Tells me how sex should be done carefully

-Tells me how my first time defines my standard of sex

-Asks me if I'm a man (I answered: ""yes I guess?"" And he said: ""No you're not, I'm a man"")

-Tries to convince me that it's raining too hard to go help my Mom at the shop

-Calls me while I'm working and tells me to go look up the Oedipus Complex and explains to me why the Oedipus Complex is scientifically proven.

Honestly my Dad is creeping me the fuck out. I'm actually really pissed right now and don't know whether to confront him or just say nothing. My own fucking dad thinks I'm fucking my mom like what the fuck is wrong with him?

It's not just this but my Dad is acting paranoid around everyone and curses out random people and makes racist remarks.

Side note: We have cameras in the store but no cameras in the office. I know for a fact my dad is creepily watching us, and when my Mom and I are both in the office (me helping her make a website) he probably thinks I'm fucking her.

Honestly I hate these things I'm typing and never thought I'd be in this situation.

TL;DR: Dad thinks I'm in a relationship with my mom, from me spending a lot of time helping her with her flower shop."
68,"My [15F] moms boyfriend [52M] makes me feel uneasy


I’ve never posted before so I hope this is okay.


I live in a small farming community with my mom, my dad left when I was three and my mom has never dated until now.

Her new boyfriend has been nice and perfectly fine for the past few months but recently he’s moved in and things feel a little weird. He’s commented how I should come and give him a cuddle, a kiss or sit on his lap while we watch tv as it’s what dads and daughters do. He’s commented on my clothing and how I’m looking ‘grown up’ and last night he randomly sent me a text while I was upstairs with the kissing emoji and goodnight.

When he was being cuddly the first time I told my mom it made me feel uncomfortably but she just told me he’s trying to be nice and trying to fit in to the family. They have also both made comments about how I’m just acting out because he’s taking more of my moms time.... I really don’t mind though... I just don’t want him to cling to me.

I don’t really know what to do now though. I’ve told him and my mom that it makes me uncomfortable but everything has become worse since then tbh. I would tell someone I know but it’s a tiny community and he’s loved here, they’ll just tell me he’s being nice.

I’m just at a loss and make sure to lock my door at night as he freaks me out. Any suggestions?

TLDR: my moms boyfriend is being weirdly clingy to me but everyone is saying I’m overreacting - am I being crazy?"
69,"Husband (45M) doesn't compromise about holidays.


A tiny bit of backstory: I moved to my husband's state (even though I hate it here) for cost of living reasons. I have no bio family of my own: only child, we immigrated from another country when I was a child, so any extended family is on another continent, my mom and I are estranged (my choice) and my father is dead. My husband (45M) and I (34F) have two kids (3 and 4 months). His entire family is in our area (his brother, our SIL, his parents).

Ever since we moved here five years ago, **every single holiday** is spent with my husband's family. Every single one. My husband also works a very rigorous schedule (hospitality), including most holidays. So whatever time he has on holidays, which isn't much, he automatically wants to spend with his family.

This is where our disconnect is:

To him, ""his family"" is his brother, our SIL, and his parents ... and oh yeah, me and our children. In other words, his bio family unit and his nuclear family unit.

To me, ""his family"" is me and our two kids. His nuclear family unit.

I was honestly hoping to start new traditions as a nuclear family for our kids. My husband ""has always hung out with my family"" and therefore sees no problem with the status quo. But his schedule leaves no time for us to do things as a nuclear family unit, just time to go over to his parents' house. Like today, on Father's Day. He gets off work an hour before the kids' bedtime and we're going over to his parents'. Obviously, it's Father's Day so I'm not putting my foot down, but guess what we did on Mother's Day? His parents' plan! Never mind that I wanted to do something different.

It's almost like his attitude is, ""Well, you don't have any traditions and you don't have any family, so let's default to what I've always done."" I tell him every holiday that I want to do something that's just us, start new family traditions for us and the kids, etc., but it seems to fall on deaf ears. What can I do here?

TL;DR: We spend every single holiday with my husband's family instead of making traditions with our own kids. Husband's schedule gives us limited times on holidays, anyway. How can I get him to prioritize at least SOME holidays with our nuclear family?"
70,"My friend’s husband made a snarky remark about my fiancé. Is it okay to uninvite him to the wedding?


So this happened a few weeks ago but it's still bothering me. I've (23f) known my friend (24f) since we were 14 and her husband (36m) for 4 years.  We’re not hugely close but still catch up when we’re in each other’s cities. My friend hasn't met my fiance (22m) yet. I was showing her photos of him on my phone, and she asked how old he was. When I said 22, she said 'oh is he really?' and I said 'yeah, he's the same age as us'. For some reason my friend's husband chose to get offended by that comment and defensively replied with 'so just a little boy then' in a smug tone (we are from a different culture and speak a different language so some nuances might be lost in translation but that was the gist of it). I didn't want to start an argument so we just carried on with our meal . My fiance is finishing up his masters, works part-time, and owns his own apartment. He's not ""a little boy"". I had invited my friend and her husband to the wedding (we have big weddings in our culture) but now I’m reconsidering it

71,"I [36M] am upset at my older brother [41M] for divorcing his wife and how he treated her


Right now we are not on speaking terms. I've known her for almost 20 years, and she is the most amazing woman. She's good looking, has a great job (has always made more money than him), and is nice and polite to everyone. If she had a fault, I guess it was strangely indulging my loser of a brother.

He's always in between jobs, doesn't really take care of himself, and doesn't really socialize much. Now, in a way I do feel sorry for him because he's always suffered from depression/anxiety and had some early career setbacks that weren't his fault, but that he has never had the will to get up from.

Despite this and for some reason, my former SIL always supported him and loved him. I know she even gave up having children because he didn't want them.

So this idiot went overseas and found himself a gf half his age, and thus asked his wife for a divorce. I know she was heartbroken. To top it off, despite being a loser he's almost financially secure because they saved a lot of money during the marriage (no kids, frugal lifestyle, her income) and he gets half. And I think he's getting alimony as well. 

The divorce has been finalized, and it's been a while since I spoke to my brother. Most of my family did support him under the idea that blood is thicker than water, but I haven't been on board. I know it's kind of tearing the family apart right now because it's basically Michael-Fredo at this point. I refuse to be in the same room as him. At this point, I know I do need to mend fences because it is my brother.  But I (and my wife) had/have a good relationship with our former SIL and it's just really awkward. 

Any suggestions on how to move forward?

tl;dr: Loser older brother divorced his terrific wife (who my wife and I were close with), no longer on speaking terms with him. Not sure how to mend fences."
72,"My [38M] pregnant wife [30F] wants to get a divorce over a misread message and refuses to allow me to explain


Hi all, 

Long time lurker, first time poster cause I need to talk to someone and ask for impartial advice. 
Last week i [38m] got married to my pregnant girlfriend [30f] after 1 year that we've been together. 

All in all we have been very happy together and have reached a point where we have a new apartment, are now preparing the nursery and in general we were both very excited for what lies ahead (due date in 3 months). 

Then Sunday night happened &amp; everything changed. 
A message popped up on my phone from an ex-gf who had been out of the country for 10+ years and she was asking me where to look for a place so she can spend her summer vacation with her husband &amp; kids (she’s not local). 
Although there was nothing erotic in the message, its phrasing could have been easily misinterpreted if someone was just seeing the notification (she was asking if i'd be in the country at that time so it could be mistaken for arranging a date etc) 
I paid no attention and went to take a shower but it seems that while I was doing that my wife read the notification and got the wrong idea (she also has my passwords because I felt I have nothing to hide but the message was unread so I doubt she read through it).
So from the moment i was out of the shower up until next morning she was crying without telling me what's wrong. 
To make matters worse I had to leave for a biz trip and I’m not scheduled to come back home until next Friday and from the moment I landed she told me that we’re done and that she wants a divorce.
i can only guess that she is now convinced i have been lying about everything in our relationship, that i have a girlfriend and that i have already/will betray her.
Starting from yesterday noon, she’ not replying in any of my messages or calls.
Today her best friend sent me a msg asking me what has happened as my wife told her she wants nothing to do with me (we arranged with her friend to talk on the phone later tonight).

To give you some insight, in our time together we have managed to overcome a few challenges and we have been great when we are together.
My job requires me to spent time in other countries (we're in Europe) so we have been forced to do the long distance relationship for a few weeks per month (that’s why I say when we are together). 
Additionally I should point out that we were both dating other people when we first met and quickly fell in love.
Although this does not mean that the past always repeats itself and it does not mean much to me or hasn’t caused me to feel really insecure, from her side she has brought up on many occasions that she thinks I may eventually meet someone else and abandon her (like I did with my last GF with who I was very unhappy). 
I should perhaps also mention that her parents got divorced when she was 3 months old and she has always felt affected by that and doesn’t want this to happen to her.

Reddit, what's your advice? How can i approach her and clear this up?  
I can’t eat and have barely slept in 2 days from fear of losing everything I was looking forward to. 

Sorry if my grammar is bad but English is not native for me and I have too many thoughts I’m trying to put in some order.

TLDR: Pregnant wife wants a divorce because she thinks i have an affair. I have no affair but as i had to leave the country for work yesterday morning i didn't manage to clarify on time and she's cut off all communication now."
73,"Help getting wife to try new foods


My(23) wife(24) eats a diet consisting almost entirely of fast food, pasta, white bread, and sugary foods. The only protein rich foods she’ll eat are chicken nuggets, peanut butter, and burgers if they’re from a fast food place. I’ve tried to get her to try bites of vegetables and meat off my plate and she vehemently refuses. I’ve gotten her to take a multivitamin(gummy ones because she won’t take pills either) to get some micronutrients in her system but I know it’s not a replacement for a balanced diet. I’m worried about the long term effects of this on her health but she writes it off mostly because she stays tiny despite her diet. I also love to travel but am worried that her reluctance to try anything remotely different would make traveling to non-western countries challenging and limited to the amount boxed Mac and cheese we could fit in our luggage. Frankly it’s also just embarrassing going to restaurants and having to ask if the chef can make her a grilled cheese or having to explain why she has nothing but dinner rolls on her plate at family meals. Any ideas on how to help me to introduce new foods to her would be greatly appreciated. 

TLDR: wife refuses to eat anything other than junk food."
74,"How do I [25F] politely invite an acquaintance in a wheelchair [30M] to an inaccessible event?


Hello reddit,

I have an acquaintance who has used a wheelchair for as long as I have known them. I am soon to move in to a second floor flat which only has stair access. The stairs are those metal outdoor kind, and pretty narrow. I want to have a housewarming, and can't just exclude them but invite everyone else we both mutually know; how can I invite them whilst being sensitive to the fact that they probably cannot attend, or if they do, have to be carried up the stairs?

\*tl;dr: is it rude to invite someone who can't access your party"
75,"i (17f) just started talking to an old friend (19m) and he’s being super clingy, i don’t know how to turn him down and be nice about it


I just started talking to an old friend of mine that i grew up with and he’s already super clingy. He’s talking about going on vacations together when he goes on leave (he’s a marine), wanting to fall asleep on facetime together, blowing up my phone when i don’t answer, ALL THE RED FLAGS. 

I don’t want to just ghost him but then again i’m having a hard time telling him he needs to relax. i get he missed me but we just started talking like 3 hours ago and i’m feeling a little annoyed. How do i let him know he’s being too pushy without hurting his feelings?


td;lr i don’t know how to tell a guy he’s being a little overly attached even though we’ve only been talking for a few hours"
76,"What are some things I [20m] can do with my sister [8f] now that we have time to be together?


My mom and dad divorced when I was very young, and he had a daughter with another woman. He lived in a nearby city for years and we would see each other something like twice a month.

Now he moved back here and we can see each other much more often, and I also I can see her more often.

We have barely interacted all these years but she knows me and we get along well. 

Because I have seen her very inconsistently, I don't really know for sure what she's into. I know she doesn't play with dolls all that much, and prefers things like Legos.

I have seen her once since dad moved back, and it was pretty brief. I was just passing by and she was watching TV in her room. I chilled there for about 20 minutes and we talked very scarcely but she was open to talking to me about the characters on the kids show.

I think she's really smart. She talks, reads and writes very well and is very polite. She plays chess, too.

What are some kid friendly things I can do with her?

**tl;dr:** I can now visit my dad more often now and I'd like to spend more time with my sister. What are some things I can do with her?"
77,"Boyfriend of three years (29M) wants to move his female coworker in (25F) in because he needs her.


 My boyfriend just moved into a new house and wants his female coworker to move in with him. He’s been struggling with his motivation to work a few months now. He owns his own business. Sometimes this coworker would come over to help with production. I have a history with this woman because she made up a lie about me to my boyfriend in the past . I’ve made it clear that I really don’t want this person around me ,but also felt that it wasn’t my place to say who he should and shouldn’t have working for him. Today, my boyfriend told me that he wants her to move in because this will be the (only) thing that will motivate him to work. I told him that I was absolutely not comfortable with the idea. I'll also add that we don't live together. It would be just her, him, and his uncle in a three bedroom house. He lashed out on me and told me that I’m forcing him to make sacrifices and swaying the direction of his life. Here’s the thing, I absolutely don’t want to stand in the way of anyone’s success. I feel like I’m in a losing situation either way. If I say okay, I’ll be placing myself in a very comfortable situation. If I say no, then he’ll resent me and I’ll be the one standing in his way. I also feel that it’s kind of bullshit to not have any alternative solutions. I really don’t think it’s necessary to live with your co worker. 

TL;DR boyfriend wants to move his female coworker into his house because he needs her."
78,"My GF wants to go to another country to visit a guy she met online a month ago


This story will be about me(21M) and my GF(18F) We have been together for two years and we’re from Poland.

So it all started one month ago, this dude started texting her on instagram because he wanted to visit our city (in Poland) and he said he wants her to guide him. At first I was ok with it but it seemed kinda fishy to me, I just feel that it’s weird to hit up a random girl on IG and ask her to guide you. So from the start I didn’t trust this guy but I didn’t want to show it too much yet. She texted him everyday and she would talk about him everyday until I said that it annoys me so she stopped for some time.

Then the day came, she met up with him in our city, he was with a friend and she also took two friends with her(I didn’t go).
It was supposed to be a short guide around the city but they wanted this dude to come over to our house and drink.
I didn’t feel comfortable with that but I said sure no problem to not be a douche.

When they came to our house my GF said that he bought her a gift from his country, it was some expensive wine and some bath products.
As you might think I didn’t feel comfortable with that as well but I tried to keep it cool and give him a chance.

So we start drinking, chatting and time goes.
I didn’t talk with him too much just a little bit.
After some drinking, my friends went smoking on our balcony, me and one of my friends stayed in the house.
I was chatting with my friend and then I see through the window that he holds her waist, and that's when it all accumulated in me.
I went there and said to my GF that he needs to act or I will throw him the f out of the house.
She said that she was drunk and she wanted anybody to hold her or she would slip and he was the closest.
So I'm like whatever at this point.

My amazing friends didn't even wanted to hear how my perspective on this situation looks like, they just called me toxicly jealous and didn't let me explain anything.

So at this point I'm so mad, mostly at my friends and my gf for not trying to understand me and for not listening to me.

They left at around two at night.
The next day I talked with my GF about the situation, at first she was arguing but then I explained my feelings and the situation with a lot of detail and she actually understood and said I'm right (my friends still think I didn't have the right to be jealous, yes they said that)

Alright let's now get to the point of the whole story.
My GF said that I shouldn't be jealous, that's just a friend etc.
She still texts this dude everyday, talks about him. I'm still not ok with it but acting like I don't care to not look overly jealous.

She recently came up with a great idea that she wants to visit him and stay for four days.
She will be sleeping at his house (4 other people live there and share it)

I told her that I'm not okay with that, but she said there's no way she isn't going and I don't have to worry.

The thing is that I trust her but Idon't trust this dude and I feel very very uncomfortable even thinking about all of this.
She will be sleeping there, drinking and partying and I'm worried that this dude will try something.

What should I do? Am I too insecure? I'm really lost in my thoughts and can't think clearly.

TL:DR - Some dude started texting my gf, visited our country, there was some bad vibes involved since the beginning and now my gf wants to visit him and stay for four days at his house."
79,"2 months into our marriage and I(25F) turned into a burden for my husband.(27M) How can I do more?


My amazing DH and I got married in April. Been together 3 years and known eachother for 5. We got things pretty down pat as far as relationship goes. We laugh, communicate well, were a team.

Late January early February I got sick, I was diagnosed with Lupus and due to the stress of it all and planning a wedding, I also got something called Functional Neurological Disorder also known as conversion disorder. You're body manifests symptoms from psychological stresses. I lost muscle strength in my legs and couldnt walk.

I worked hard and got better after a month early March. My husband and parents(mostly my husband) worked to take care of me bring me to my appointments etc.

So happily ever after I was good I walked down the aisle I had no troubles during our honeymoon, we were married and happy.

Until two weeks ago. It happened again. I wasnt feeling great the past week, and then I woke up and my legs wouldnt work again. Same feeling. Then my arms went. At one point I had an episode where I couldnt speak or open my eyes. My DH had to call 911 and take me to the hospital. And just last night, I went mute.

This is the weirdest disorder ever and honestly really stressful to be caused by stress. It doesnt help itself much. 

So here I am on medical leave, and we both agree and my doctors agree, my job currently (I work for CPS) is not helpful to my health. I dont know what is going to happen. If I'm going to be able to work full time, or at all for the rest of my life. My job right now has great medical benefits and I'm milking them for all they are worth I promise.

I dont want to do this to my DH, I feel like it's all my fault I cant get better because it is psychological. Doctors have been treating me like it's my fault too. I have appointments every day if not twice a day, which DH takes me to. He took the week off work to take care of me because he knows my parents would just put me in a chair and leave me for 8 hours until DH comes to pick me up again, like they did before. And he doesnt want to be around them after the stunts they pulled at the wedding.

I just want to do more. I'm working so hard to get better and all I'm doing is getting worse. I dont want him to resent me. Hes the most loving man in the world and tells me every day he loves me for me not because I can walk or talk or even go to the bathroom by myself. He says he will stand by me.

How much can a person take though. I feel like I duped him into staying with someone broken who cant do anything. I know this is all insecurities and yes before anyone asks I'm seeing a counselor, and psychiatrist, nuerologist, the works. We are also weighing the options of putting me in a facility but he has expressed that unless it's truly recommended he would rather not.

I guess what I'm here for is what more can I do for him so he doesn't experience caregiver burnout? What can I do to show him I appreciate him?

Tldr: I've gotten a rare disease that occurs whenever I get a lupus flare up that causes me to lose mobility, my voice etc. I'm worried my husband will experiencing caregiver burnout and I want to know what more can I do for him."
