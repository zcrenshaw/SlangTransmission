&amp;#x200B;

My first post was almost 4 years ago now. It wasn't super popular, but since I got quite a few helpful PMs at the time and since I still read r/relationships from time to time on my main account I thought I owed you guys an update. So at the time I wrote the OP I was trying to work through my wife cheating on me and had decided to forgive her (lol). As most of you suggested that was the beginning of the end. Our ""marriage"" pretty rapidly eroded over the next few months. Some of the highlights include my wife (Sarah) revealing to me that she thought she was polyamorous and her trying to make me feel comfortable with inviting another woman into our relationship. Yes, she had the audacity to do this after being caught cheating, which just shows how much of a pushover she thought I was. Surprisingly, this woman Sarah wanted as our third wasn't even the same woman she'd originally had the affair with.

I was at my ultimate low point; I felt like I was going to have a panic attack at work most days and I absolutely dreaded going home. Looking back, the saddest part is that I blamed myself entirely for this mess. My wife was openly dating this other woman and trying to make it appear as normal as possible to all of our friends. Sarah kept telling me I would ""come around"" to it and enjoy having someone else in our relationship. Wtf. It took me way too long to wake the hell up in this relationship, but her pushing polyamory on me was my wake up call to all of her manipulative b.s. (Not saying polyamory itself is bad, but how she used it in our situation was shitty). Something in me finally broke free and I asked for a divorce. 

It was like a light switch flipped. As soon as I decided I had had enough I began to see all the events in our relationship in a completely new way. I'd mentioned in our previous post that we'd had threesomes with other women quite a bit (sidenote: I'm also a woman, not everyone got that in my original post). Threesomes were always something I had been against when we originally started dating. My ex brought the idea up repeatedly in our relationship, even bringing our friends into the conversation a few times over drinks to sort of normalize the idea. The first time it happened I had actually left the bar and gone back to our place to sleep. I was woken up by Sarah bringing another woman to our bed and I felt like I had to join in to prevent it from being awkward. My ex then told all of our (mostly male) friends about this encounter and of course they were overly supportive of our ""awesome"" relationship. Threesomes just sort of spiraled from there and I began to think that maybe they weren't so bad after all. Maybe I had truly changed my stance on them. I could probably type for hours about all the other manipulative behaviors my ex had, but needless to say I finally realized I had been in a pretty abusive relationship. Emotionally and verbally. I felt broken. 

To absolutely no one's surprise the divorce was a complete shit show. Sarah still wanted to control my behavior even when we were separated and upon realizing that I was no longer her puppet she lost it. She actually tried to convince me that she was owed 1/3 of my portfolio (lol). We weren't even married a year.. Then one night when she was getting some of her belongings from my place to take back to her new girlfriend's she tried to kiss me. My response? I immediately threw up. The fact that she physically repulsed me to the level of getting sick really paints the picture of just how through with her I was.

Fast forward to now: all I know about her is that she ended up staying with that younger girl she was dating when we divorced. I actually felt bad for that girl. She reminded me of myself so I'm sure that's why Sarah picked her. Hopefully she won't be as easily manipulated. 

I - however - have been fucking fantastic. After the stress with the divorce I felt like the weight of the world had lifted from my shoulders. My anxiety started to ease up and I figured out that the main cause of it had been that relationship. I had the storied short rebound relationship and when that ended I set dating aside for a while to focus on myself. I used that time to discover myself, so to speak. I found old hobbies I'd stopped doing when I got with Sarah and found a gym buddy and got in amazing shape. I traveled to a few places and decided to move to a completely new city. I had a few one night stands and decided that wasn't for me. However, after I'd hit my stride being single (and actually really enjoying it) I met this woman, Jess. 

I guess since I wasn't looking for anything it took me by surprise, but we clicked. We more than clicked. I felt at home with her. She's pretty much everything I ever wanted in a partner and everything I thought that wasn't possible. I thought you just had to settle. But nope. Jess and I have been together 2 years and she's shown me what a real loving relationship is about. A relationship without abuse, without manipulation. One where we both have our own individual goals and relationship goals. Where we actively make time for one another. It's wonderful. So that's where I'm at right now. I know a bunch of people in this subreddit have been in shitty relationships like my previous one, but I'm here to tell you it is so much better once you get out of them. Both being single and being in a better relationship. So don't worry about being alone for a bit. Accept it. Lean into it. Do what makes you happy for a while. And hopefully when you least suspect it your Jess will come along too. Even if she hadn't in my case, I know I would've been fine being single. I know I would've been 1000x happier than I was those last few years with Sarah. So please - if you're in an abusive/shitty relationship, or just one where you have zero self esteem left - get out. Now. 

TL;DR: I grew (or strapped on) some balls and divorced my ex. She went on to a younger (easier to manipulate) version of me. I re-discovered who I was being single and was finally happy for the first time in years. Then I met a girl. Said girl makes me very happy and I can't believe she's mine. :)"
1,"[UPDATE] A guy [20M] has been coming onto my girlfriend [21F] and she's oblivious but seems to like him. I [21M] feel like I'm gonna lose her.


[Link to original post](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/9bqg45/a_guy_20m_has_been_coming_onto_my_girlfriend_21f/)

I didn't think I'd be back with an update so fast, but here I am! I took your guys' advice on befriending/hanging out with Ian. So the night I made the post, I swallowed my pride and told my girlfriend over text that Ian seemed like a nice guy and that I would love to meet him sometime. She replied, and these are her exact words, ""Oooo yes!!! I feel like you guys would love each other!"" I replied, ""Lmao, okay but where?"" ""What about lunch at _____ on Saturday? We can invite Lily (one of our good friends who is also in my girlfriend's class with Ian) so he doesn't third-wheel?"" I agreed. 

Saturday morning, I woke up early, showered, picked out a nice dress shirt with the least amount of wrinkles (made sure to roll the sleeves up to my elbows), and put on a new pair of Vans that I had been saving. I looked in the mirror and hey, I clean up pretty nicely. 

I kinda fucked up on the timing though so I ended up showing up around 15 minutes late and my girlfriend, Lily, and Ian were already there. My girlfriend saw me first and she yelled very dramatically, ""Baaaabe you are so late!!"" and I don't even know why but my heart just swelled. I made my way over to the table and Ian got up and introduced himself and we shook hands (I made sure to do a nice, firm handshake). Then Ian said, and I quote, ""Wow dude, you have really beautiful blue eyes"" and I was caught off-guard and didn't know what to say so I ended up saying, ""Thanks man, you have really beautiful...green eyes?"" Then I awkwardly laughed (big shout out to my awkwardness) but Lily said, ""Get a room you two"" and we all broke out laughing. 

Lunch went really really well. My girlfriend told the story of how we met, which is highkey embarrassing (it involved me tripping over a curb) for me but Ian thought it was great. Ian and I had a thoughtful discussion about politics/economics and I found out that he an I both were national chess champions in high school! We both agreed that we need to play each other sometime. 

I left lunch with my girlfriend and we went back to my dorm together. :D

All in all, I feel like a weight has been lifted off of my shoulders. My basically squashed all of my suspicions and how could I not see that she is loves me as much as I love her. Also, Ian is nice guy and I think we'll make good friends. 

TL;DR: Went out to lunch with my girlfriend and Ian and it went fantastically. "
2,"I [23 F] caught my boyfriend [26 M; 1 year] on tinder. He swears it's not true. I'm going to lose my mind.


My friend came to me yesterday at lunch with screenshots of my boyfriend's tinder profile. The pictures were all old photos so I confronted him immediately expecting to hear something like ""Yeah, haha I forgot to delete that."" which is cool. He denied being on tinder at all and my friend suggested that she make an account, set it to his specifications, and see if he turns up. and there's his profile. 


So, this means that my boyfriend has been active on tinder within the past two weeks. I confronted him with this and he changed his story. Now he's saying that his friend has been using his account. He shows me his phone and says, ""Look, I have nothing to hide."" and of course the app is deleted.


So I take his phone, download tinder, log in with his facebook and see that he has been active, albeit infrequently. There was one girl that he tried to meet up with back in May when I was out of town. The girl gave him her phone number and even though he deleted whatever messages they exchanged, I still saw that he had her saved in his contacts. 


So that's about everything that I know. He either cheated on me or planned on cheating on me while I went out of town, and I'm sure this isn't the only time it's happened. This relationship is pretty much over. 


He is swearing up and down that it's not true. He doesn't use tinder and he doesn't know this girl. I'm going crazy with how much he's outright lying. He seems so sincere, but I KNOW what I saw. I can't listen to him deny this one more time. 


I know that this is the end, I guess I'm looking for advice on how to end it in a way that doesn't leave me second guessing myself. and moral support.

TL;DR: Caught my boyfriend on tinder trying to meet up with girls while I was out of town. He's denying it so vehemently that I almost believe him. What do I do?"
3,"My (23m) roommate (25m) of 2 months put surveillance cameras throughout the apartment, says it's for security but they're in my own room too?


I met this guy through my university's housing listserv where we were both looking for a roommate. We decided to room together. Signed a yearlong lease that began may 1st.

Yesterday I took out the vent in the bathroom to clean out lint and found two wireless cameras. One was pointed towards the toilet, the other into the shower. It really freaked me out. After poking around the rest of the vents I found one in my room, the kitchen and the living room. I didn't go into his room so I don't know if he has one too.

He says they're ""for security"" and I shouldn't have messed with them. He was really mad at me for tampering with them. At his last place he had roommates who chronically stole from him among other more disgusting things, so he feels safer with the place under surveillance.

I have not done anything like that and never would but I'm extremely uncomfortable with these running 24/7. Now I know every single thing I do is probably filmed from somewhere. I have no privacy. Even in the bathroom I'm being recorded, what could be stolen from a bathroom? There's just no logical reason for that. I feel like he's got these up for perverted reasons, at least in part. I don't have a girlfriend but if I did there's no way I'd ever bring her here now. 

My roommate and I aren't friends, we've mostly just talked about things related to living together. Until now we've politely gotten along. Now I think he's a fucking creep. He's also just kind of weird. Hardly ever leaves, stays in his room all day with the door shut. 

This is intolerable to me. I told him if I ever found one in my room again I'd destroy it so don't even bother because I'll be checking.

I'm definitely gonna move out. It'll be hard because everyone's trying to find housing right before school starts so it might take me a while. How do I deal with living with him in the meantime?

TL;DR: Roommate has hidden cameras running throughout the apartment, no privacy."
4,"I [29f] am on vacation with my husband [32m] and I intend to tell him I want to seperate when we get back.


I initially posted this to beyond the bump, but I need some additional advice. 

Basically to make a long story short, I got married when I was 26, and husband and I had been together for 4 years before that. He always had a tendency to be on the immature side but in a sweet, naive way. He was not perfect but was kind, thoughtful, fun and generous. 

Around the time we got married his personality started to change. He became more angry, impatient, etc. He blamed it on hating his job. 

I found out about 3 months after our wedding that he had been gambling quite significantly, and I was devastated. He promised not to do that anymore, went to gambling anon, we went to couples counseling and things were mostly better. 

I got pregnant (my son is now 15 months) 

During the course of our marriage of the last 3 years, things have slowly taken a turn for the worse with his behavior and personality. He would have manic episodes where he would stay up all night, drink, etc and then down phases where he would sleep all day and be miserable. He even got fired after not getting to work on time repeatedly. I finally forced an ultimatum on him this last year that he needed to see a psychiatrist, and when he finally did, he was no surprise diagnosed with bipolar disorder. 

Now I'm a nurse so I 100 percent get it and support and have no judgement or stigma toward mental illness.

My husband was put on meds about 8 months ago, but he never fully committed to taking them regularly, lies to me about taking them and his mood swings are worse than ever. 

It's not just the mood swings, it's like he regressed. Hes capable of taking care of my son but he (husband ) is just such a baby!! He cant do anything for himself, not his own laundry, not clean up his dirty socks, not pay his own doctors bill, make his own dentist appt. I have to meal prep all my sons meals when I go to work so that he will feed him. 

He is so lazy it makes me sick. I have to beg and plead him to do anything around the house to the point where I dont even ask anymore. About 1 month ago, I decided to just pretend I was a single mom and I do absolutely everything for and with my son, mostly alone. But at this point my husband feels like this huge ball and chain. He makes a mess, isnt nice to me, eats all the food I buy and I'm so so unhappy. 

We are on vacation and this is my final straw. My parents who are very supportive let us go away for a long weekend together while they care for our son. I needed this break and rest so badly. 

Despite my telling my husband explicitly not to go to the casino, he went last night, after drinking and called me in our hotel room 50 times asking me to transfer him money in his account because he ran out and ""they know I've been playing so I'll win"" he would not stop calling me and acting crazy and I had to walk over and get him. He actually cried because I wouldn't give him money. I legit cant take this anymore!! 

He has spent the rest of the trip drinking and being a complete ahole to me tbh. Leaving me stranded in places in a foreign country. I could go on.


Over the course of our 3 year marriage he has not been there for me during my worst times. He slept through my entire labor. He didnt make it to a single doctor appt when I was pregnant except one and I ended up having to stay for additional testing bc my blood pressure was high. He whined the whole time about how he was hungry and ""can we leave yet??"".... when they took my son to the NICU he didnt console me when I sobbed. I hurt my back a few months back, and I was in so much pain I couldnt even move. He refused to get up with my son and I had to call my mom to come help me with him. Then my mom made me go to the ER bc I clearly was in bad shape but she had to force my husband to take me. He screamed at me the entire way there and dumped me off at the front door and didnt even come in. Sure there have been good, even happy times, but I'm just getting so fed up with his childish ways and his inability to take care of himself or his mental health. 


His parents live nearby but hes not very close to them and they know nothing about our marital problems or his bipolar diagnosis. He would be mortified for them to know. But I'm so tired of going through all this by myself. 

I think I want to seperate for awhile and ask him to go live with his parents when we get back. I would plan to sit his parents down and let them know exactly what's been going on because I feel like I need to unload all this burden on someone else. 

I guess I'm just wondering how to go about all this. Should I talk to his parents first and let them know what's going on? Should I talk to a lawyer first? Should i give stipulations to the separation like you need to do xyz before I'd consider you back? For what it's worth I can pay all our bills without his help (it will be tight but doable) as I'm the primary earner in our home. I am kind of nervous he might fly off the handle when I tell him this so should I have someone on standby? 

Tldr: my husbands mental illness is out of control, and he has been treating me badly for a long time now. He has been acting like a straight up child while we are on vacation and I want to tell him I want to seperate when we get back but I want to go about this the most painless and smooth way as possible."
5,"I (28f) am in a great relationship with my boyfriend (32m), but his brothers wife (35f) is making me miserable, and I’m scared this will ruin us.


Hi all, 

Thank you in advance for reading. 

I have been with my boyfriend for 4 years, 3 years officially. We are really happy for the most part, with some downs as with any relationship. 

I am a bit of an introvert. I get comfortable fairly quickly though, if I feel like the person I’m speaking to is interested in speaking with me. I get shy, and I am not that good at speaking about myself. Questions like “what have you been up to” and “what’s been happening in your life” always unnerve me. I have small hobbies, I work full time, but I don’t really think I have interesting answers for those types of questions! 

I bring this up because, when I first met my bfs brother (31m) and his wife - let’s call her C, I was a little shy. I naturally felt more comfortable the longer we hung out, and I opened up a bit more. 

The problem was, C was asking me questions about my life and seemed interested in getting to know me, but would go and have conversations with my partner behind my back about parts of my life that “concerned” her. Silly and trivial things like my family, or past relationships. He wouldn’t care about these things normally but she makes them an issue. 

My bf and his brother and wife are very close friends and they have a group of very close friends that have known each other for years and years. C is very territorial over them, and by the way she talks she thinks she knows them better than anyone, even though they’re all grown men (30+) she meddles in all affairs, has an opinion about everything they do, and is really critical of dates/ partners. I honestly feel she is a reason why 90% of them are single and have been for a while. She always pulls the age card, that she knows more because she’s older. She met them when they were all early twenties and I feel like in a subtle way she takes credit for their development into men, as weird as that sounds. 

I carried on being nice and kind for the last couple of years, but she just keeps doing these manipulative things to distance us. 

- She doesn’t invite me anywhere. She is the self proclaimed planner of events for their group of friends. She mentions in invites “no gfs” or the like, so it’s her and all the boys. 

- She judges everything I say, and questions my opinions or my thoughts in a very condescending way to embarrass me.

- She makes comments to my bf all the time about how much he’s “changed” since being with me. That he seems unhappy (he doesn’t), that he’s “let himself go” (he hasn’t). All of these little digs have an impact on him, and sometimes we fight afterwards because he says he feels like he’s not living the life he wants. I question further and he realises it’s stupid and apologises. 

- She pulled my bf aside a little while ago and told him that no one likes me in their group and that they’re all just too scared to say anything. He confronted his closest friends and found that wasn’t true. 


I realise these things seem small and trivial but it’s every few weeks for the last couple of years, and it gives me massive anxiety. I feel left out, sad, and like there’s someone out there waiting and hoping my relationship fails. 

You’re probably wondering why my bf doesn’t do anything. He has stuck up for me a lot before, but now it seems he doesn’t want the drama or stress so I just can’t bring it up or it turns into a big fight. He doesn’t want to fight with family and I get that. 

What can I do? Anything? Besides really making a scene? 

Thanks for any advice. This eats at me a lot. 

Tl;dr : bfs sister in law is not accepting of our relationship, for what feels like no reason. She makes me feel small and insignificant. It gives me anxiety, and though confrontations have happened in the past, it hasn’t really changed. 
What can I do? "
6,"My (24m) little brother (16m) was recently kicked out for being gay by our parents (50s). He is currently staying with me and I don’t know how to handle this.


About 5 months ago my brother “Will” came out as gay to me. We’ve always been super close as we grew up under super conservative, strict parents and we ended up having a kind of bond where I had to provide the kind of emotional support that our parents never gave him, or me. 

When he came out to me, I was honestly fairly surprised as I had no inclinations that he was gay, but either way, I told him that it didn’t matter to me but to not tell our parents as I knew it wouldn’t go over well. 

Well turns out they found text messages Will had been sending to his boyfriend and long story short, they confronted him, he confessed and they kicked him out. Yesterday he showed up at my apartment upset and asked if he could stay with me. I of course said yes. 

But honestly, I’m at a loss of what I can do here. I barely make enough money to look after my own expenses, let alone those of another person. But he’s my brother and I can’t just kick him out and let him be homeless. 

He still needs to finish high school and he needs a place to live, but honestly, I really can’t afford this. 

Also I don’t know how I can provide the kind of emotional support he needs with this right now. Our whole life I have been the one to help him emotionally and with growing up, but I don’t know anything about helping him through growing up gay. 

Also I don’t know if I should confront our parents about this, maybe try to convince them to let him move back in? I’m not sure if that’s even a good idea but I don’t know what I’m doing anymore with this. 

Will seems to be withdrawn into himself, and talking to him doesn’t seem to be having much affect. 

I know there’s a lot of questions here, but any thoughts would be really helpful. 

Tl;dr: My brother is living with me after being kicked out for being gay and I’m not sure what to do from here. "
7,"I (32M) worry that my wife (37F) is not prepared for my death


  

So there are some things that have been really weighing on me lately and I’m wondering if anyone has experience or advice in this area.

Some background info: I have Cystic Fibrosis, a lung disease that I have had all my life. By and large, I have been really healthy and have taken good care of myself, but the average life expectancy of CF is around 38; I’m now 32. I can feel my health starting to gradually decline, and in the next ten years I will probably need increasingly intense medical procedures (i.e. transplants, IV antibiotics, lung cleanings, etc.) to stay alive.

The problem isn’t my health just yet. Rather, it’s my wife that I’m concerned about; I’m starting to really worry that she is not prepared for my inevitable decline and death. 

A friend of ours just lost his dad after years of him being in really bad health, and it brought up a conversation about what we would want if we were in a coma or terminally ill. I made the comment that when my health gets bad, I won’t want to hang on for years and drag the people I love through misery just to stay alive for a little while longer. To me, bad quality of life is no life at all. My wife responded curtly, “Your health isn’t going to get bad” and changed the subject. She wouldn’t talk about it again. That struck me as odd, and I can’t get it out of my head. I’ve tried to broach this topic with her in the past, such as drafting a living will, but she either refuses to talk about it or stops talking altogether which is very unlike her.

I suppose my question is, how do I prepare her for the end of my life? She does not deal well with loss, having only lost two family members her whole life (great-grandparents), and the thought of even losing her aging cat can send her into a panic attack. I also worry that she might leave out of self-preservation if I get really sick, though that may just be paranoia on my part. Since we’ve been together, I haven’t experienced a truly bad sickness (knock on wood). I really want to make it as easy as possible on her when I die, and I’m afraid it’ll crush her.

I’m also concerned about leaving her with massive medical debt as a result of all the care I’ll need at the end. I’ve even toyed with the idea of divorcing her to keep her from having to assume my inevitable medical debt, though I’m not 100% sure if that would work or if it’s even necessary.  I'm also doing whatever I can to leave her with enough life insurance to keep her comfortable.

tl;dr – Is there any way to prepare my wife for my eventual death and make it easier on her?"
8,"Update: My husband [M26] and I [F26] moved away from home, 1,500 miles, 3 years ago and now my in-laws are wanting to move out to us.


Original post: https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/94bgnw/my_husband_m26_and_i_f26_moved_away_from_home/?utm_source=reddit-android

*TL;DR: update to a previous post. Clinger in-laws want to move closer to DH and I, now they want more money from us.*

After posting here and reading your suggestions I tried talking to my husband about my concerns and fears. He could not see my side of things because as he says ""there is not a problem yet because they (my in-laws) have not moved out here yet and therefore he hasn't been given the opportunity to show that he can chose me and will not be over at their house 24/7 or vice versa (them at our home)"". I conceded and decided to just let it the conversation hopefully happen more organically than me coming out of the blue with it. 

Well low and behold it did, kind of. Today I get a call from my MIL asking if I really want them to move out here and if I had any problems. I took the opportunity to jump on it and say I have no problem, but boundaries need to be set and set now. Such as DH will not be at their house all the time, i.e. for coffee everyday or dinner every weekend. I also brought up the fact that she cannot come in to my home and change things. No more redecorating and rearranging unless explicitly asked for by me! She was surprisingly agreeable and sounded understanding that we have our own lives. I brought up the fact that I feel that I cannot say anything bc FIL is sick and I will look extremely selfish. She told me that I can bring things up and even though he is sick, our marriage comes first. 

I felt somewhat better at this point in the conversation until she brought up that she was talking to DH this morning about their property tax and how they are short on paying it. DH told her we could give it to them, but that I would be upset. 

Now some backstory, my in-laws are awful with money. If they have it, they spend it. They do not save. If someone needs money they will hand it over. They have lived above their means for a very long time and as a result are in some serious debt. We have helped them with things from time to time. For example, they live in the country and needed their propane tank filled one winter. We gave them $700 to get it filled so they would have heat. We have paid bills that they couldn't make some months. We paid for their plane tickets to come visit us after FIL was done with first round of chemo and radiation so they could visit their son. That was $800. 

DH and I both have good jobs and make good money, but we have debt of our own. Mainly student loans. We live well and below our means. We have a savings and are okay financially, but we have worked hard to have what we have. I have put my foot down recently and said we have to stop giving them money. They will take everything we have and DH will give them everything we have without thinking twice about it. 

Now back to the taxes, MIL asked DH this morning if I don't see them as family because I would be upset if we gave them money for the taxes. I don't know how to respond to that. She cornered me on the phone and brought up the fact that they paid a lot for our wedding. Now mind you, our wedding cost maybe $2,000. We were very frugal and nothing was extravagant. So I said do you want us to pay you back for our wedding and she laughed saying no I don't expect to be paid back for things I am willing to do. So now I am stuck, she is accusing me of not thinking of them as family because I don't want to give her money for the taxes, but they paid for our wedding. 

I am so angry and do not know how to approach it rationally because at this point I'm ready to burn every bridge leading to them. "
9,"(24F) My boyfriend (24M) invited my awful father to dinner with us and it was a disaster. Any advice?


So, my father has been absent for most of my life. He left my family when I was 6, so I have very few memories of him. He once called me when I was 12 and told me that he didn’t want to be apart of my life, ever. I made a promise to be better than he ever was.

Fast forward to now, I have a college degree, I’m a personal trainer, I professionally model, live in a nice apartment, have a great relationship with my friends &amp; family and generally live a really good life. I’ve been with my boyfriend for 2 years now. He’s always been aware of my dads absence in my life and has respected that until now. Apparently my father saw an ad for the gym I work at with my phone number on the ad. I am the model in the ad and he instantly recognized me. He left a voicemail on my phone asking for a session, but I have purposefully avoided it. My boyfriend decided to call my dad back and spoke about my life. I told my boyfriend never to do this again and respect that I don’t want my father in my life.

My boyfriend told me it was gonna be date night at our favorite restaurant. Turns out he invited my father. I was livid. My father was saying how proud he is of me, but I don’t want to hear it. He ignored my existence for most of my life, so I definitely don’t want to see him now. I left the restaurant crying and upset.

My boyfriend is upset with me for not giving my father a chance. He had good intentions but he should’ve respected me when I told him I don’t want to see my father.

**TLDR- My father has been absent from my life since I was 6. My dad found my number on a personal training ad and left a voicemail. My boyfriend invited him to dinner with us (without my permission) and it was a disaster. I left crying. My boyfriend is mad that I didn’t give my dad a chance, but I’m upset my boyfriend disrespected me when he invited my dad, knowing that I don’t have a good relationship with him. Any advice?**"
10,"Update: My BF[21M] is not handling me [22F] going to Law School Well


Hey everyone,

If I missed your comment on my last post i'm really sorry and I've just been super busy with law school as well as my relationship. I decided to take a week to let things settle in even further. I made it explicitly clear that his behavior wasn't ok and we needed a change if this relationship was going to survive. Verbally he was on board, but after 24 hours it really fell apart.

Tonight, I pulled the plug. It was hard, and awful because I do love him and I will always love him but we are no longer in love. He asked me what I wanted, and I said I wanted him to be ok with less communication and be confident in our relationship, so that I could be at school guilt free. I asked him what he wanted, and he said he wanted more of my time, communication and energy.

His wants had nothing to do with what was best for me, or would make me happiest.

That was really hard to hear and we both cried for awhile when I pointed that out. He understood, he saw it coming and he didn't beg or fight it. We just cried.

So anyway, I wanted to say thank you to EVERYONE who reached out to me. Seriously, it made me feel like I was actually in control of the situation and not crazy for walking away. Thank you for being a community that validates others feelings and is honest and truthful.

Now, I'm gonna go shower and watch stupid shows on netflix.

**TL:DR Broke up with my boyfriend when he couldn't adjust to the lack of free time I now had in law school.**

11,"UPDATE: My (23F) boyfriend (28M) of two years hasn’t introduced me to his family yet and it bothers me


Original post here: https://ud.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/8boczi/my_23f_boyfriend_28m_of_2_years_hasnt_introduced/

Reposting in accordance to the guidelines.

Tl;dr: Y’all were right. He was (probably) cheating.

So shit went downhill very quickly after I made that post. I thought we were in a good place in the relationship, but dang, was I wrong. Just a heads up, what follows is not really related to the original post topic.

Three months ago I started having a weird feeling that he was into his coworker, who I’ll call “Q”. I actually liked her a lot; she was always nice and made an effort to talk to me whenever I came in to visit my boyfriend at his work. But I dropped by without warning once and it was just the two of them having a smoke break outside. Not a big deal at all, but the look on my boyfriend’s face when he saw me was troubling. I felt like I had interrupted something, but I brushed it off. 

A few days later I get a call at work, it’s my boyfriend saying he needs to talk to me. Apparently he got in a drunken brawl the night before because Q’s drug dealing ex-boyfriend showed up at their work and started harassing her. So my boyfriend defended her, got a couple cuts on his face, and let Q spend the night at his place so she would feel safer. He assured me that while he let Q sleep in his bed, he slept on the couch. 

While I was relieved Q was safe, I was weirded out that my boyfriend didn’t text or call me at all while this whole thing was happening. His excuse was that it was pretty late when it happened. Mind you, we both work nights and text/call each other late all the time. I can’t even count the amount of phone calls I’ve received from him at like 4 or 5 a.m. But I didn’t hear about this incident until almost a day later. 

Apparently Q’s crazy ex was assumed my boyfriend and Q were together. During the fight he was shouting “are you f*cking her?!” and then he started messaging my boyfriend similar things and threats. My boyfriend sent me screenshots of the messages and I noticed he never actually told the crazy guy that he WASN’T fucking Q. Why not just deny it? Tell the crazy guy: “I have a girlfriend of 2.5 years, I’m not f*cking Q, you got it wrong.” When I asked him that, he said that he didn’t want the crazy guy to know about me and potentially put me in harm’s way. Uhh. The whole reason that guy is upset is because he thinks you’re fucking his ex? If you just said you had a long-term girlfriend, wouldn’t that de-escalate this whole situation?

For the next month after that, my boyfriend was distant, snapped at me constantly for no reason, and never made any effort to see me. All the fun plans we had discussed just dissolved. I had been trying to plan a vacation with him all summer, but he said he couldn’t afford to take work off. 

I broke up with him, albeit for a different reason, but the Q situation was still very present in my mind. Two days later, he and Q visit the hiking spot he kept telling me that we’d visit someday this summer. A week after that, they both take that nice vacation he could suddenly afford. I had dated him for 2.5 years, and I never was mentioned once on his social media (I’m not on any social media sites, if that matters). He ended up posting photos of Q on both of their trips, after like 2 weeks of dating.

In my original post, some people commented that my boyfriend might be hiding an affair. I commented, and this is a direct quote, “I can say with certainty that he isn’t cheating.” Ha! Although I can’t 100% prove that he cheating while we were still together, deep down I know he probably did. I don’t know if his roommates and other coworkers knew he was cheating on me with Q, or if they just didn’t care enough to tell me. I’m obviously omitting a ton of other details too for the sake of length, but there was more to it.

So, in the end, I was never going to meet his parents (it’s funny to think that’s what my original post was about!). He knew he didn’t want me, but didn’t have the guts to break up with me. I’m sure Q has already met his whole extended family at this rate this is going. I stopped checking his social media since all I wanted was a confirmation that they got together pretty much immediately. It helped validate my suspicions about his cheating, but now I don’t care to know about their relationship anymore.

I blocked his number and returned every last item that reminded me of him (every gift he gave me, every ticket stub I had saved, any souvenir I bought while I was with him somewhere, etc.) I literally packed it all up in a bag and left it for him to deal with. I could’ve just thrown it out, but I wanted him to look at it-- confront the remains of our relationship and make him think about why he had to end it in this way. Not that he cares. But maybe it made him reflect a little? 

We had one last conversation when I saw he called my phone (which shows up even when though his number is blocked for some reason). It was the most infuriating and pointless conversation I’ve ever had but I see no reason to talk to him ever again. Working on repairing my self-esteem after all of this nonsense is my main priority at the moment.

I’m writing this update now because I’m moving tomorrow. All of this will be behind me. And I also just got back from visiting a guy I dated before my ex and really liked, but the timing never worked out. He is the sweetest person, and he makes me feel good about myself. I had a great weekend with him and it looks like we’ll be seeing more of each other very soon. At least this story has a happy ending!

12,"Boyfriend [26M] can’t stop invading my privacy to the point I [24F] feel violated and insecure in my own home


It all began after the first month we started dating and I don’t know why I didn’t end things right then and there. While I was taming a shower, he looked through all of the photos on my laptop and yelled at me cause I still had photos of me and my ex. I didn’t even remember, cause I don’t look at those photos and I guess I was too lazy to delete them. Also, I don’t use that laptop so often since it’s slow, soooo yeah, I wasn’t being sentimental.

I’ve always been a nosy person and I admit I stalked his wall, his exes, even his parents, BUT it was all public info. I’ve been alone with his laptop/phone etc. but I’ve never ever even thought about reading his private conversations. I wouldn’t do that to anyone. He doesn’t care, though. He memorized my ipad password and he read everything, including some really private posts here on reddit. He yelled at me and broke up with me. 

He occasionally lurks in my facebook account, because I’m dumb and I’m always like “No, he wouldn’t do that again” but he always does. Today I was logged on our shared laptop and I saw in my fb app that there was some activity going on 40 minutes ago while I was taking a shower. I looked the chrome history, but he had deleted everything. I lost it and I started crying and he had the audacity to blame me for his trust issues and said that there is something I’m hiding since I’m reacting this way. I tried to explain I have nothing to hide, but it’s just horrible to feel uncomfortable at home. I can’t even sleep properly anymore because I’m nervous if he’ll decide to randomly read my messages. He scrolled maybe months of my fb searches which is really embarrassing and yelled at me again. He said I must be hiding something since I’m so upset. I don’t hide anything and I never gave him a reason not too trust me. Once he dumped me and I grabbed a beer with an old friend and he found out, blamed me for cheating on him and even complained to my mother. I go to therapy every week (not only because of him, I have other issues). There was this group session and I met a boy who has similar problems to mine and I felt that finally I’d have someone outside therapy to talk to. He’s not my type and I didn’t like him in a romantic way, I just felt we could be friends but my boyfriend found out we’ve talked once (because he was snooping again ofc) and again yelled at me. He said I was a cheater and that’s why he had trust issues. I’ve always been faithful and I didn’t deserve this. 

I changed all my passwords but I’m tired of feeling uncomfortable in my own home. He went out and told me I deserve this and he’s right to invade my privacy and I have no right to be mad. I don’t know what to do anymore.

Tl;dr: Boyfriend is invading my privacy and blames me for his trust issues "
13,"My boyfriend (22M) wants to break up with me to date other girls, but wants me to still be close to him? (21F)


My boyfriend and I have been dating for a year, and I'm his first girlfriend. I just graduated college and he still has another year. 

He told me last night he loves me but he's not sure if I'm the ""one"" because I'm the only girl he's ever dated. I feel heartbroken. I feel like I'm not enough. I can't say I didn't see this coming though because we've had breaks where he dated other girls. I know he thinks about the possibility of being with another girl a lot. I'm sad he would rather choose ""exploring"" over being with me.

The problem is, he wants to remain close friends. He insists we still talk like normal everyday and hang out. I feel like a second option. What should I do? My heart hurts and I feel like a second choice :(

14,"My (29M) fiancée’s (27F) sister (28F) doesn’t want to be alone ever and it’s making my life miserable


(Throwaway because they both Reddit)

So my fiancée and I are set to be married in October and this should be the happiest time of our lives. She’s the most amazing person, we’ve been together for some time, been through so much together, and she is the perfect match for me. However, she has a sister that’s really close with her so getting alone time is a near impossibility. 

They both used to live in a house together and grew up very close (both their parents passed). After we got engaged we had to work out a plan for her moving in with me slowly (her sister initially threw a fit because she thought I was stealing her sister from her). She’s moved in with me now and her sister lives in the house alone. Problem is, her sister refuses to be in the house alone because she’s scared, so instead we alternate nights between the three of us staying at the apartment and the house. 

This is obviously incredibly frustrating and stressful. I have to pack an overnight bag almost every night and I am constantly forgetting things (shoes, deodorant, etc). The back and forth affects my job performance. Finally it’s just annoying that I don’t really get to spend alone time with my fiancée (and we don’t have sex if her sister is there).

The only alone time we get is when her sister’s  boyfriend, who lives 2 hours away, stays at the house with her or she goes to his, which if I’m lucky is once a week. I don’t know if he doesn’t know or doesn’t care, but he’s not emotionally supportive of her and doesn’t seem to care about the hell this situation causes. When he is in town my fiancée and sister want us all to hang out but I refuse and look like a jerk (it’s literally our only alone time so I don’t wanted to do that). When the sister goes to the boyfriends house, they fight so she just ends up calling my fiancée all weekend anyway.

I feel pressure to make the most of the alone time we get so as soon as we’re alone I try to fit in a weeks worth of intimacy and have to hope that she’s in the mood.  

I try to talk to my fiancée about this but she gets really defensive of her sister. She tries to tell me that she has a lot going on,  she’s working things out and it will sort itself out , but I simply don’t see it. She also says that her sister doesn’t like being alone and she needs to be there for her. It’s 4 weeks from the wedding and she’s still spending 6 nights a week with us. My fiancée will not let me tell her sister how I feel because it will make her feel bad.

Am I wrong for not wanting to allow this? I’m marrying my fiancée, not her sister, and I don’t think our marriage should start off with her sister staying with us 5+ nights a week with no end in sight. 

I have an opportunity to deal with this tomorrow. All four of us (me, f, sister, bf) will be at her house tomorrow. I thought I had the weekend without the sister but her boyfriend goes home at the slightest shade of inconvenience - he has to work 8am Monday so he needs to go home tomorrow (Saturday). I seriously can’t take this anymore and it’s affecting our relationship. What should I do?

Tl;dr: my fiancée’s sister crashes on our couch constantly even though she has her own house because she’s afraid of being alone. "
15,"I (43M) am considering getting a divorce from wife (42F) but am questioning my own motives. Do I need a sense check?


We have been together since we were about 19, and got married at 25. Our relationship, like any other, have been through some good and bad patches. However, this current situation has pretty much been unchanged for about 2 years. Even more concerning, we have moved beyond arguing to more or less complete indifference. 

I caught her lying to me about seeing another man about 3 years ago (classic text on iPad / iPhone situation). She, to this day, assures me it was all platonic but that he is very important to her (to a point, she actually told me he was the most important part of her life). At that stage, they also started working together. She was my rock and my best friend and I pretty much relied on her for all my support so these events shook me incredibly badly. I got badly depressed and (luckily) was talked out of a serious suicide attempt (even had the service arranged!) by some fantastic first responders. She is somewhat aware of all of this but does not have much interest in it [see below). 

One of the other things that also happened back then was that she told me that she is not interested in any of the bad things that happens in my life. I relied on her too much and she did not want to be my support anymore. If I had something to discuss, I needed to find someone else to talk to. She needed time to focus on herself and she was not going to be be there for me anymore. Things got pretty rough for a while. For example, I’d say we were going to struggle to pay our bills this month, she’d accuse me of trying to manipulate her and she would immediately go out that day and spend $6,000 on clothes. 

Now, fast forward 2 years later: I have pretty much completely removed her out of my life.  I do not talk to her about anything that is going on with me. I did not even tell her my sister has had a baby (we emigrated, so don’t see family much) or anything about work, for example. Our day is pretty much that she goes off to work (I work from home except when travelling). I look after the kids, make sure they are fed and picked up from school etc. When she shows up, she talks about her day and all the characters, clients and so forth. She then goes to bed, and I go and watch tv, play games, whatever until I go to bed a few hours later.  When we were younger, and in love, we used to argue all the time. Now, nothing. Just don’t care enough. 

The focus on herself has reached new heights. She goes out with her one recently divorced friend most weekend nights. I asked her to bring back $5 last night for tooth fairy money for our son. She did not , and then I had to go out at 1am when she came home to go and get something for our kid. (She told me I was being a martyr). She has not bought the kids a birthday or Christmas present for 2 years and last year she did not even get out of bed to watch them open their Christmas presents. 
As you can guess, I am actually incredibly lonely. I work from home most days, so don’t have much interaction with people outside of Skype. My sister, who I am close to, is in a different time zone so that is complex. I want to meet other people but I don’t want to be that sad married man. I’d much rather do it with a clean slate. 

I know I have a tendency to be controlling and manipulative. I know this about myself and I am consciously aware of it and try and fight it. This is the problem. 

I need my best friend, I need my companion and my partner. 

She has zero interest in a conversation about it (flat out refused to join me for counselling 2 years ago). I think I want to break it off but I wonder if I am doing it for the right reasons. I think she actually, deep down, knows what is going on and she still cares about me and if I ask for a divorce, it might prompt her to engage again. And, then, maybe she fixes her behaviour and hates me for it. Because she and I will feel like I manipulated her into it.  A divorce will also be bad for her lifestyle. I earn 90% of the money, and I will ask for the kids to be with me as primary carer (as I am today). I am thinking of giving her a cash sum and she can go on her way. But this will hurt her lifestyle (expensive clothes, cars etc.). 

So, am I wrong? Is there a less nuclear option available?

TL:DR Wife has pretty much zero interest in me or our home. She will not engage on problems at all, and I have stopped involving her in my life. I want to leave but worry that a) am I being manipulative and is there a less drastic option or b) she ‘fixes’ the issues but hates me for it because I manipulated her into it, thereby making it worse. "
16,"Boyfriend (25/m) gave the expensive bottle of champagne he’d bought for my (21/f) upcoming birthday to his friend (and former sexual partner) as a going away gift.


Long story short, my boyfriend bought us a very expensive bottle of champagne for my upcoming 22nd birthday. It had been sitting in our fridge for two weeks, and then today I noticed that it was gone. 

I texted my boyfriend to ask him if he took the champagne with him to his friend’s house and his only response was, “yea. sorry.” My boyfriend has been spending all weekend with this (female) friend of his who is due to move to a different state next week. The whole situation is very uncomfortable for me because they initially met on Hinge, the dating app (before we started dating) and went on two dates, and even slept together once. They’re only friends now and I completely trust him, despite feeling a bit jealous and uncomfortable that he’s spending all Labor Day weekend with her and her friends and not me. 

And now I’m feeling even more uncomfortable and even slightly upset that he took the bottle of champagne that was meant for my birthday to go have fun with this girl...

I don’t want to start an argument with him and sound crazy...but am I wrong for being upset about this? He doesn’t seem to understand why this is bothering me and I don’t really know how to explain it. Surely he could just buy another bottle of champagne for my birthday, but it’s not really the same to me...

tl;dr: boyfriend gave the expensive bottle of champagne he’d bought for my upcoming birthday to his female friend that he used to sleep with as a going away gift. "
17,"(Update) My [21F] sister [18F] won't stop making comparisons between us


Original post: [https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/8ovnl4/my\_21f\_sister\_18f\_wont\_stop\_making\_comparisons/](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/8ovnl4/my_21f_sister_18f_wont_stop_making_comparisons/)

&amp;#x200B;

So my original post didn't get a lot of attention but I thought I'd post an update because things have turned out pretty well. Some commenters on my original post suggested that my sister might just be feeling anxious about going off to college at a new school. Bingo! 

&amp;#x200B;

Most of the summer continued as it had been before, with her being a total snob and annoying me. But a few weeks ago, before she left for college, we hung out for a day together and went shopping and she completely surprised me by asking for my advice on how to make friends at college. She said ""you've always been so good at making friends, and I wish I could make friends that easily"". She actually....complimented me on something for the first time in a long time. I gave her some tips on how to make friends in college and she really listened. She confided in me that she was really nervous about making friends at college. I think that is why she had been acting snobby towards me, as a way to make herself feel better.

&amp;#x200B;

After that day things got a lot better between us. We spent some good time together before I went back to my college town and she left for her prestigious university and she mostly stopped putting me down and making comparisons. It's been 2 weeks since we both left and she has texted me pretty much every day since then. She was having a hard time at first, but today she told me about how she got lunch with a few girls from her class and they are planning on hanging out again tomorrow. I am excited for her! 

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR: my sister was acting like a snob to make herself feel better about being anxious for college. She actually sought out my advice on making friends because she thinks I'm good at it and it has made our relationship much stronger! I feel more on an even playing field with her. "
18,"I got home from work and all her (25F) things were gone. She had packed up and moved 1,000 miles away without saying one word to me (31M)


TLDR; I was with my partner for 5 years. One day I come home and all her things are gone... it's been over a year since she left  and she tells me that leaving has been the single greatest regret of her life.

Okay so here it goes reddit. I know the answer but this whole situation is riddled with so many issues that I think I just need to put it all out there so I can sort through the details. Maybe you all can help me out because I keep blaming myself for not realizing what was going at the time. I still care for her and miss her but shes been gone 13 months now and I need to move on.

So I was with a girl for 5 years, we lived together for 3 of those years and at first she was everything I could have asked for in a partner. We met at work and hit it off, it didn't take long before we were inseparable. I use to sketch quick portraits of her because it would make her smile, made sure to give her flowers once a month (yellow daisies), and I'd always go out of my way to make sure she was happy. She would show her love in a different ways, she always made sure I was comfortable, the house was spotless at all time, she always wanted to do what I wanted to do. She wasn't much for gifts or planning out nice gestures though, that always hurt a bit (I think because I was the complete opposite) she really loved me she just isn't the type to plan ahead.

So I bet your wondering when it all went south? Well its complicated and it took a long time before we hit the breaking point. I'm not pointing fingers because we both messed up but our first speed bump was my ex wife... yes I'm divorced, got married when I was 19 because I knocked my gf up and well I'm Hispanic so marriage is almost an expectation in our culture after something like that. Needless to say we weren't together long. I've had custody of my daughter since she was 3, she's 11 now. My gf couldn't stand my ex because she was never around and was never involved with her daughter. The problem here was that I'd be the one to get an earful later. Thankfully we would only see her every few months so it wasn't to big an issue. 

A year into our relationship my gf lost her job but she was still attending school so I helped her out with rides and whatever else came up. After a bad year she was placed on academic probation and had to go speak with a counselor to enroll again, only problem is she never went... as the months went on I would occasionally mention going back to school or getting a job but I didn't push it. By this time we were already living together. 

I resented her sometimes for staying at home; she was unmotivated... but at the same time she loved me, she was mine, and all I wanted to do was take care of her. 

Over time the resentment grew. I would ask her about school and work and it would always turn into an argument so I began to avoid it. Keep in mind that despite this issue we still had a good relationship.

Time went on and I had a moment of anger, weakness, stupidity.. call it what you will but I started texting my ex. It went on for a week and it didn't lead to anything physical just texts... but that doesn't matter because she found out and the damage was done. This is the part that confuses me because I think I cheated out of spite. I say that because I had every opportunity to sneak out but I never did. I think I just wanted to hurt her... or I wanted her to show me that she cared. This next part is the reason I felt this way and it's in no way an excuse for what I did.

I work for an oilfield company so the hours can be long. I had been having a rough few weeks and I just didn't want to do the 50-60 hour work weeks anymore. I asked her to try and find a job because the hours were ""slowly killing me"" and I thought with both of us working I could afford to take a pay cut, but she didnt. She never did more than fill out an application or 2 before she gaving up and it just tore me up inside to know she wouldn't put in the effort for me. Bringing it up would only cause arguments so I just held it in.

So about a year and a half went by after that and we patched things up (though the cheating was held over my head for the next 2 years). We were happy, had a ton of adventures, but her situation hadn't changed she still wasn't working. At this point we found out that her grandmother had cancer. Her grandma raised her so it was a significant event. Her family was in Illinois and it hurt her so much that she couldn't be around. Her mom is a manipulative b*tch that would make things worse. She would call her just to say her grandmas going to die alone, or that she doesn't care about her family. All this really weighed heavily on her and she would occasionally slip into a bit of a depression. She began gaming to distract herself and she made some female friends online so I was completely supportive,  she had found friends to talk to and that made me happy.

I guess this is were shit hits the fan. Her name was Anna.... they would game, gossip, laugh all day... I liked her, she seemed nice. I encouraged her to go out... and go out she did.... I hadn't realised it at the time but Anna was planting seeds. She would tell my gf that she needed to go out and just enjoy herself because she had gotten into our relationship at such a young age... she was missing out on life. A few weeks of this eventually lead to my girlfriend coming home at 8, 9, 10am after a night out. I shared my concern but it was to late, she had this idea that she deserved to go out and have fun without me. I agreed but I would tell her to be home by 2am at the latest... she didn't take kindly to curfews.

Anna was only around for the last 2 months of our relationship. Things spiralled out of control quick and we went went from having a life together to just being two people living under the same roof. Anna had convinced her that she was unappreciated... she also gave her a solution... make him appreciate what he had by taking it all away. 

I'm not trying to paint my gf as the bad guy. I understand why she left and what she was thinking. She wanted to see what was out there, she wanted to be closer to her family, she wanted to get away from the man who she felt didn't appreciate her.

So here's the part you all have been waiting for... the heartbreak, I remember it so well.  It was a Saturday, I was working and we had been texting up until noon. She stopped replying and I didn't think anything of it, maybe she took a nap. I got home at 5:30pm, exhausted,  it was 106F that day and all I wanted to do was shower. I walked into the house and noticed a box in the kitchen... i looked towards the living room and there's a few things missing off the wall... I felt a bit alarmed but it didn't seem like a big deal so I took a few steps as I was unbuttoning my shirt and began to look around. I called out her name and no reply. I said her name again and began walking towards our bedroom. I swung open the door and looked towards a wide open closet... all her clothes were gone... i felt sick to my stomach but I still didn't know what was going on. I ran into the 3rd bedroom which was her ""makeup room"" and that's when it hit me. Her vanity was gone, her clothes were gone, she was gone... the final blow was when I checked our bank account... all I could do was sit there and cry while dialing her number over and over again...  she never answered.

So I'm writing this 13 months after the fact because she regrets leaving. Her and Anna had a falling out a few weeks after she left and my exgf has been hanging on to the hope we might still get back together. She even has a steady job now, she's been there a few months and she says that she just wants to prove to me that she's changed. 

I loved her but I don't want her back reddit. She destroyed me when she left. I hate her for it...
So why does it still hurt so much?"
19,"My [M 50s] wife [F 50s] of 23 years is under investigation for inappropriate relationship with a student. We both teach at the same university.


Like the title says, my wife is currently the subject of an investigation into one of her graduate students' allegations that my wife behaved inappropriately towards her. The student is 24. My wife has been placed on leave until the conclusions of the investigation. 

The accusations include ""sexting"" from my wife to the student, suggestion that she might receive better letters of recommendation from my wife in exchange for sexual favors, unprofessional settings for meetings ostensibly about the student's upcoming MA thesis proposal (bars, our *house* when I was away for a weekend), and inappropriate physical contact like massages and comparing bra sizes. 

From what I understand, things went south as soon as my wife made sex a condition of the recommendation letters. That was the point where the student reported everything. I don't know to what extent everything before then was consensual. Usually in these cases, students can appear to be freely participating but in reality they feel pressured to go along with it to protect their grades and careers. There is a power imbalance. 

My wife swears it was consensual and that the student initated it. You can rest assured I do not take that at face value. Like the title says, I'm also a professor at this school, although in a very different department. I'm not oblivious to the reality of inappropriate relationships between students and the older people who are supposed to be their mentors. The reality is that there is an undeniable element of coercion at play.

I have asked my wife to stay elsewhere while this is sorted out because I have a lot of thinking to do. 

Regardless of what the committee concludes, my wife definitively cheated. From there the additional possibilities only get worse. I'm more or less decided that I'll soon be speaking to a divorce lawyer.

My question is not about what to do with my wife, but with my colleagues. It's known that we're married. I imagine it's known in her department why she is on leave. The fall semester is about to start, and I'm dreading being the subject of gossip. My reputation will now be ""the husband of that woman who harassed her student."" Or, among a sympathetic minority in her department, perhaps ""the guy who divorced his wife over a false allegation.""

I'm wary of talking about this with anyone I know in my personal life. I'm a pretty private person. I keep a strong boundary between my personal and professional lives. Unfortunately this situation has probably broken that down.

I'd be grateful for any advice on how to respond to anyone at school who brings this up.

Lastly, and I'm not sure it even matters now, but there's the issue of all the ways my wife broke my trust. It's not just the cheating, it's also how she always presented herself as someone ethically offended by teacher-student relationships. She had never given me reason to think she was anything other than staunchly opposed, as you'd hope and expect from anyone working in education. I feel she betrayed me in terms of her values, not just her fidelity. Leading me for years to think she believed something that she then acted opposite of. She also kept her sexual orientation a secret from me - she always identified as straight, didn't give any signs contrary. 

Is it even worth trying to make sense of who she is as a person given all those deceptions? I feel completely lost underneath the anger, like I never actually knew her. I don't understand it.

TL;DR: My wife is under investigation for having an inappropriate relationship with a student. I'm struggling with how to navigate it with colleagues who know both of us. I'm also struggling with figuring out my wife's true character. "
20,"My boyfriend (28M) has been collecting my (24F) rent for a free house


I've been living with my boyfriend for a year. I'm a graduate student so I have a very minimal income and I'm very upset about this but my boyfriend says he was trying to do something nice. 

My boyfriend and I moved in together to a house that he found. He arranged all the landlord stuff and told me to send $1000/month to the landlord's bank account (this is a very normal rent for our area, but I could have probably spent less if I'd lived in an apartment.) I have been doing so for the last year, only to find out yesterday from his mom that his parents actually own the house and they aren't charging us rent.

Upon hearing this, I asked my boyfriend about the $13k that he has had me send to some account, and he told me that he was doing it for me as a gift to give back later so I could ""see how much I've saved.""

I'm livid. I'm not irresponsible with money; I have no debt and I even have some savings. Over the last year, there have been things I've had to miss out on because they just weren't financially feasible without this money. There have been some times when I couldn't get my tires replaced, or couldn't get a new blazer to replace my threadbare one so my boyfriend got to swoop in and save the day. It always made me feel so bad that he could live just fine on his salary (not THAT much higher than mine) but I couldn't live well on mine. Now I know it's because he was spending $1000 less than I was every month.

I don't know what to do. I feel upset and uncomfortable about the whole situation but my boyfriend won't listen to me. He keeps saying that this was supposed to be a surprise gift and I'm taking it the wrong way. I don't know what to think. Am I overreacting?

TL;DR boyfriend has been collecting rent for a free house and putting it into an account to give to me later even though I've been struggling to keep up with the ""rent"" payments"
21,"Ex-boyfriend (26M) broke up with me (26F) at the start of the summer so he could ‘be selfish’, now says it was a mistake and wants me back


 Throwaway because people know my main account. 

This is pretty much the real life version of the How I Met Your Mother story arc where Lily called off her wedding to Marshall so she could go across the country only to regret it and come back to him. Of course in that story everyone lived happily ever after, but I don’t know what’s going to happen here. 

I dated Alexander for 5 years. We met at university, and moved in together a year and a half ago in the city where we both found work, miles away from any family. In my eyes, we were happy. We still made time for each other and made each other smile - the week before we broke up he surprised me with a home movie night of our favourite memories, so it wasn’t like the love was gone for months before. As a note, Alexander is a teacher, so he gets the summers off. I work a standard 9 - 5 job in marketing. A couple of days into Alexander’s summer break, he said that he had to talk to me about something important over dinner. I get home to find all of his clothes and things packed. I’m not saying that he left me with nothing, it was more trinkets that he’d had from childhood that decorated our shelves and his books, things like that. He said that he had been thinking long and hard about this, and he had decided that he was going to spend the summer in the city where his brother lived with him, without me. He said that he had woken up one morning and realised that for the past 6 years (we had been friends before dating) he had not done anything without thinking about how it would affect me, and if he wasn’t ‘selfish’ now, then he never would be. He proposed that we take a break in our relationship during this time, but I was so blindsided by it all that I said that if he left then our relationship was over. He said that he wouldn’t be changing his mind for anything, and left with his stuff. 

That was around 2 and a half months ago. To say it was a rough few months would be an understatement. I called in sick the day after everything happened because every time I moved I felt like throwing up. I had to tell everyone in my family about it - I very quickly stopped using the opener of ‘something has happened between me and Alexander’ because everyone I sent that to thought we were engaged. I took him off of all my social media, but it was harder to try and get rid of him from the place we lived. Every corner of every room had a memory we shared in it. I seriously considered moving just because it all reminded me of him too much - I could still afford the rent, but my budget had become a lot tighter, so I couldn’t even splash out on some big stupid purchase to make myself feel better.

Eventually, it all started getting a bit easier, and I nearly felt myself getting back to as normal as I could be. The one thing I didn’t do was go on any dates or have a random one night hook up. This wasn’t because I was waiting for Alexander, but I just didn’t want to deal with anything like that (eg. waking up after a one night stand to find the guy gone would probably have triggered some kind of reaction over being left).

A couple of days ago I got home from work to find a note slipped under the door. It was from Alexander, saying that he was back in the city and wanted to meet up. I agreed, mainly because we hadn’t spoken for months, but also because a part of me wanted to show him that I was fine without him.

We met, and the first thing out of Alexander’s mouth was that he had made a massive mistake in leaving. He said as soon as he stepped off the plane in his brother’s city that he wished I was there with him, or rather, that he was home with me. His family was heartbroken that we had split up - his brother apparently tried to go down the ‘psycho ex’ front and justify that me not wanting him to go was controlling, but that just made him feel worse. Without prompting, he said that he hadn’t so much as looked at anyone else while he was away - his brother also apparently tricked him into going on a date a month into his stay (something like his brother invited him along to a guys meal with him and a friend only for the friend to be a girl who thought it was a blind date) and as soon as he realised he left. The culmination of this was that he still loved me, and wanted to get back together, even if that meant by ‘dating’ again instead of him just moving back in and picking up where we left off.

I told him straight away that I couldn’t just pretend like nothing had happened and go back to how things were, but I also didn’t say no outright either. I have no doubt in my mind that I do still love him, but I know that if he leaves again it will kill me, and I’ll have no one else to blame. Should this be my time to be selfish and say no? 

TL;DR - Boyfriend left out of the blue saying that he needed to be ‘selfish’; has reappeared months later saying it was a mistake and wants to get back together - I do still love him, but I don’t think I’ll survive another sudden departure if he changes his mind again. "
22,"UPDATE: The woman (36F) I've (34F) been dating broke up with me, said she was joking, and is now putting it on me.


[Original post](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/97ohm4/the_woman_36f_ive_34f_been_dating_broke_up_with/?utm_source=reddit-android)

Thank you everyone for your words of wisdom! I made my last post because I needed to know that I am not being irrational 

I went against the advice of all of you and I called her just to give her my feelings and let her know what's up. BAD IDEA. 

She argued and called me selfish for not considering her feelings. She said I must be the only important person around. She tried threatening me, guilting me, and belittling me. 

She argued that I'm ending the relationship because she apologized for ending the relationship. Apparently, the relationship started back up when she apologized? Then she denied our relationship all together. 

She sent me hundreds of texts every day. Each text gave me a good reason to never speak to her again. 

I went from being hurt to being pissed off at her level of manipulation.

She deleted me from all social media then tried adding me back. She then canceled those requests. 

I mailed all her belongings back to her using my dad's addy as the return address. I did this just in case she didn't remember where I lived then she wouldn't be able to drop in on me at all. 

She left me a voicemail letting me know she received her stuff and she stopped contacting me, well, until today. She texted me earlier trying to make plans for next weekend when she's in town. I ignored her. 

Her text stated that she has big changes that I'm going to like. I'm concerned that she is now moving back here. She probably believes that the true problem isn't the game she's playing with me but that she moved out of state. If she comes back everything will be ok. 

She was in town over the weekend which made me nervous that she was going to show up at my place or just do something crazy.

 I had every intention to not be at home at all but I've come down with a case of pneumonia so that kept me bedridden. She didn't make her presence known if she did show. 

Also, since she stopped trying to contact me I have been getting phone calls from local numbers I don't know. I don't take the calls and they never leave a message. 

Anyway, thanks for all the advice and support! I hope she stops trying to get in contact with me and the situation doesn't escalate. I also REALLY, REALLY hope she isn't planning on moving back here and that ignoring her will continue to work. 

--- **TL;DR;** : thanks for all the support. You guys really helped me deal with the girl I'm no longer dating. Ignoring her seems to have worked. "
23,"I [23F] have a weird/embarrassing way of coping with the loss of my dad 2 weeks ago. Friends found out and were really mean about it.


My dad and I were extremely close. 3 weeks ago, he was diagnosed with colon cancer and died within the next week. I am proud of myself for being strong for him while he was here, but now he's gone and I need ways to cope.

When the funeral home people came to remove him, I went to the other room. When I came back, there was this little teddy bear sitting in the place he was. It has a little teardrop and holds a tissue. I have become very attached to this bear over the past few weeks. I carry it with me everywhere in a special little tote so no one can see. (I also carry a backpack for school) but sometimes when I'm alone I'll give it a squeeze or rub its fur. For some reason this is very comforting to me. I also think this is a temporary thing, as I come to accept his death more fully I will grow out of it. I'm very  embarrassed to still be so attached to a stuffed animal, but it's the only thing that helps me right now.

I am in nursing school and pretty close with the friends who are in my lab group. I was laying in the hospital bed pretending to be a patient so another student could practice their skills on me. He had forgotten his pen light. He was in the middle of practicing so I just told him to go grab mine from my bookbag. Well, he opened the wrong bag first. The one with the bear. He immediately pulled it out and was like ""what the hell is this? Are you seriously carrying a bear around?"" and then he pulled it out and made fun of it saying ""look what I still found! She's carrying a teddy bear!!"" and then another student was like ""AWW, she's just like a baby"" then started talking to me in baby talk. He also ripped part of the tissue in the bear's hand. I felt so humiliated. I know in a way it's my fault because I didn't specify the bag, but I thought my friends were kind enough to understand and not make a big deal out of it. Unfortunately I was wrong. I jsut took it and put it back in my bag, but they kept bringing it up.

&amp;#x200B;

I return to school tomorrow and I'm so embarrassed that they will make fun of me again. I know it's a weird habit, but like I said, it's been 2 weeks since he died so whatever works just works. Also, they all know what happened to my father. 

&amp;#x200B;

How do I navigate this?

&amp;#x200B;

\*\*tl;dr\*\* the funeral home gave me a teddy bear after my dad died. I am attached to it and my friends found out and made fun of me."
24,"Update: Should I [21F] un-invite my now ex [21M] to my party?


Link to original: [https://bu.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/9bv0fx/should\_i\_21f\_uninvite\_my\_now\_ex\_21m\_to\_my\_party/](https://bu.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/9bv0fx/should_i_21f_uninvite_my_now_ex_21m_to_my_party/)

But basically my ex attempted to cheat on me, so I broke up with him and I was wondering how/if I should uninvite him to a party I had been planning for Saturday. 

&amp;#x200B;

I ended up not needing to. I went out with a group of friends the night before my party and I was having a good time. He was blowing up my phone the entire night but I honestly didn't even know because I wasn't checking it. My best friend who lives with me and I eventually went home around 3 in the morning, and to our surprise he was sitting on our front porch. I was like what the hell are you doing here, and he told me that he had been calling and texting me to talk with him and that he was waiting for me to come back so that I would be forced to talk to him.

&amp;#x200B;

He was so arrogant, as if he thought the mere sight of him would somehow make me melt into his arms and forgive him. 

&amp;#x200B;

Best friend to the rescue here. She flies off the handle and screams at him to get off our porch and how she can't even stand the sight of him. He was so scared of her, it was kind of comical because he's 6'5"" and she's literally 4'11"". But anyway she kind of chased him away for me and told him that if he even thought about showing up tomorrow she would call the police.

&amp;#x200B;

So yeah, he didn't show up. He texted me the morning after that he was out of line and apologized, and I haven't heard from him since so I think I can finally put this drama to rest. I had an amazingly fun party!

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR: get a best friend who can be your guardian angel"
25,"How do I (22F) talk to my boyfriend (27M) about his hygiene?


Throwaway, since he lurks sometimes

Mark* and I have been together for about 1.5 years, and have lived together for about a year. Although we moved in together really early (Long story short it was an escape from a toxic living situation) we have a healthy relationship otherwise. We both love each other, and we try to communicate as best we can. 

Which is part of why I'm posting here.

See, Mark is kind of a stereotypical nerd, in that he gets obsessed with new hobbies to the point where he forgoes basic hygiene. Thankfully, he's not at pissbottle level yet, but as of writing this it's been over a week since I last saw him shower. And even then I don't think he washed his hair.

I should mention Mark has really long hair, which he hasn't cut in about 5 years. I usually love long hair on men, but right now his is disgusting. It's matted into a half-assed dred that stinks badly enough to leave a miasma after he's been in a room. It's made even worse by the fact that he's a smoker. 

I've tried to be sympathetic. He does have a stressful job and it can be hard to find time between work-sleep-relaxation, but it's gotten to the point where I can't even hug him without wanting to rech. 

I've tried bringing it up to him, but he just gets defensive and accuses me of nagging. He usually shuts me down by telling me to ""mind my own business"". He only does this when I mention personal hygiene. 

I love him unconditionally, but I'm not at all attracted to him like this.  Our sex life has taken a major hit, since the smell is such a huge turn off. 

How should I approach this tactfully? I love him and want to be intimate again, but I don't know how to bring this up without him feeling attacked.

TL;DR: Boyfriend is stinky and in denial. How do I convince him to wash more?"
26,"I [23M] am considering breaking up with my boyfriend [29M] because I feel like he’s just flat out trashy.


So, pretty recently we decided to have a date night. I made a reservation at an upscale restaurant and I wanted to go have a good time and enjoy ourselves. We’ve never done anything like that before and don’t get to often because stuff like that is expensive, and being two working-class people, we don’t have a lot of money to blow. 

So I get ready and dress for the occasion. Pretty casual but still nicely dressed (nice jeans nice shirt kind of thing). 

I head to his house to pick him up and head inside for a minute. He’s in the bathroom finishing getting ready and asks if he can drive. I tell him that’s fine. 

He steps out of the bathroom wearing a wife beater and some stained work pants and his work boots, grabs the keys to his $100 geo prism, and asks if I’m ready to go. 

I ask him if he minds driving my car or his other car, which are a little nicer to try and dress for the occasion. Normally I don’t mind riding around in the geo at all (I mean a running and driving car for $100, why not?) but I wanted us to have a decent date night. 

Then he kinda gets pissed and asks if I’m embarrassed to ride in it. He knows where we’re going and I told him I’d rather not look like we just sold a prescription of pain pills to pay for the food. I’d rather ride in one of the cars that doesn’t have bungee cords strapped to the doors to keep them shut for this. 

So then it turns into why am I such a high maintenance asshole and so worried about what other people think of me, and why am I always trying to play high roller etc. 

I really don’t think I am. I’d rather just take some pride in our appearance for once and have a good night together. Plus I’d rather take one of the cars that are exponentially less likely to break down on the way there. 

So we cancelled date night. I don’t ever ask a single thing from him and the one time I do I get grilled. Im honestly pretty hurt about it but at the same time I am happy I saved the money. 

Anyways, his hygiene and personal appearance has always been an issue and frankly it’s been a huge turn off for me. I’ve talked to him about showering more and washing his clothes and wearing deodorant, but none of it seemed to stick. 

At this point I’m embarrassed to be around him in public and for him to meet friends and family. Everyone that has met him comments on how gross he always is. 

I’ve lost pretty much all of my attraction to him and frankly just don’t even like spending time with him anymore. There’s basically no action in the bedroom anymore either. 

I know he’s better than this, which is why I’ve stuck around this long. I know he’s a caring, intelligent, loving man but for fucks sake I’m getting tired of smelling BO every time I’m around him.

There are plenty of other things as to why I’m tired of this relationship but I think his hygiene and lack of giving a single fuck about his appearance is the main one. 

Is there any fixing this or should I cut it off? I’ve tried before but he clings so hard and I really don’t wanna hurt him. I don’t know how to make him just give up on it. 

TL;DR - boyfriend takes no pride in his appearance or personal hygiene, caused a fight and canceled a date night because of it. Been a recurring problem for a while now and I’m tired of it. "
27,"My sibilings expect me (30m) and my wife (30f) to babysit their kids all the time because we don't have our own so we are 'not tired'


Me (30m) and my wife (30f), married for 6 years now. We are very happy and at the moment not considering having kids at all because we don't want them (at least yet).

My brother and sister have 2 small kids each (4m, 2f, 2m, 1m) and whenever we all meet they at one point say to me or my wife to take care of them because we 'don't have kids and are therefore not tired, haha'.
Any family meetings end up in me and/or my wife chaising children. 

Last time when we visited my sister, she and my sister in law asked my wife to just hold a baby for a second and watch out for kids then left her alone for an hour with all 4 kids. 

Not to mention regular babysittings we have to do at our place when they go somewhere. 

But the worst part are family reunions (we live in a country where it happens often) where there are always this stupid comments with us not knowing what is it to be really tired, we don't know what the meaning of life is (???) etc as if we were guilty for not wanting kids. 

I don't understand it, if they wanted kids and we don't, why do they expect us to take care of them so much now just because we don't have our own?

I want to talk to them and don't know how to do it without them getting angry. 
I have tried few times but they were very offended so maybe I am doing something wrong becauae I told them exactly what I mean. Is there some nicer way?

Tl;dr: My sibilings expect me (30m) and my wife (30f) to babysit their kids all the time because we don't have our own so we are 'not tired'"
28,"My husband [36M], three children [10F, 7F, 4F] and I [28F] moved states to help my “sick” aunt [65F]. It has been nothing but hell since.


First, let me apologize for any spelling, grammar or format errors since I’m on mobile. 

To start this off, my husband, kids and I have lived in Texas for over 10 years. Last year, our daughter passed away and it really affected our family. We were all lost and didn’t know where to begin to start rebuilding our lives. My aunt, we’ll call her Susan, offered a place in her home for us after our daughter passed, saying that it would be a huge help to be near family and that “that’s what saved her” after my uncle passed away. We declined at first, but over the last seven or eight months, she began telling me over the phone that she was extremely sick and could really use the help. She promised us her two extra rooms, no real worries about bills except just “help out every now and then when you can,” and the ability to start working toward rebuilding our life. Slowly, but surely, my husband and I began to talk about it, think it over and really consider it. We knew that we did not want to stay in Texas and began to think that maybe a move could be what we needed. Not to mention, I’d be close to the last of my remaining family, my children could have a “Grandmother figure,” and it would give us the emotional support we needed to heal from our loss. 

We talked on the phone every day for hours, making plans and discussing what we’d do once we moved there. July comes and my husband was approved for a work transfer, we had our belongings packed, and everyone was excited to be moving. Our kids were overjoyed at the idea of having fun with their “auntma,” and I was excited about the idea of them learning about my own mother from the closest family to her. We loaded all of our belongings into a moving truck, loaded our three kids, two cats and Axolotl into our vehicle and set out to Florida. 

We get to my aunts house and are met with the first problem. She’s a hoarder. I’m not talking about clutter on tables and shelves, I mean full on HOARDER. She has boxes and furniture and junk and God knows what else stacked wall-to-wall in the two bedrooms that she had offered us. My husband and I worked for over a week cleaning out one room, until we hit the first brick wall. Susan got upset that we had moved her estranged daughter’s clothes (they haven’t spoken in over 7 years now) and was really angry with us. We apologized and told her that we didn’t mean to overstep any boundaries and that we would not move anything else without her consent. She seemed okay after that, and began telling us what could stay and what could go, what could be packed or burned. Also, during this time my husband started work and was informed that it would be part time only. My kids also were sleeping on the couch and a mattress during this time because all progress on the second bedroom stopped. My husband and I started looking for an apartment but with living so close now to a college town, all of them were either full, subleases or out of our price range. 

About three weeks ago, my aunt and I got into a huge fight over a door being unlocked in her house. She yelled at me over it and began degrading me over other, unrelated things. I am not good with negativity and will immediately begin to get quiet, so I let her yell at me for over 15 minutes. My kids heard it, and it scared them a lot because my husband and I don’t fight or argue. After she was finished, there was an extremely uneasy tension in the house and she then proceeded to “pout” in her room for three days. 

Now as I said, we have two cats. My aunt also has two cats of her own, so my husband bought a large bag of cat food and it was for all of us to share. At some point while she was pouting, she took the bag into her room so my cats only had a little bit of food during that time. When she finally came out of her room, I asked her if I could get some of the cat food since my babies were hungry, and she flipped her shit again. It turned into another HUGE fight, she threw the bag of food at me, started screaming that I was “the devil,” and that I was just “using her for every damn thing she’s got.” All because of cat food. 

Another three days of pouting or sulking in her room, and then suddenly she comes out and acts as if nothing had happened at all. She was so chipper and positive, wanted to go do things as a family, spent time with my kids and took them to church with her, and everything seemed to be going okay until just a few days ago. 

Another fight, but this time, she hit me in front of my kids and knocked me into my oldest daughter. She swung at me a second time and I pushed her away from me and told her not to ever touch me again. My kids were screaming and crying because they’ve only ever seen violence on TV, and she screamed at them to “shut their goddamn mouths.”  I told my husband (who was in the restroom when she hit me) that we needed to call the police and she suddenly starts saying loudly, “I didn’t hit you, what are you even talking about, you’re a damn filthy liar.” 

I ended up filing a police report, was given the advice to file for an Ex parte order due to how she seems to just flip out over seemingly nothing. The officer I talked to seems to think that she has a mental illness and said that it would probably be beneficial to do since she has many firearms in the house, is quick to anger and obviously has a penchant for violence. It worries me that she does have guns in the house and seems to be mentally or emotionally unstable. She has begun doing other petty things like locking us out of the house if we go outside for any reason, kicking my cats or hitting them off of furniture, saying things to my kids about how my husband and I are going to hell because we’re not Jehovah’s Witnesses like her, and the list goes on. She’ll rifle through our things when we’re gone and today, I caught her doing something to the food that we have in the refrigerator. I don’t know what she was doing, but now it worries me to eat it or feed it to my kids. 

We have been looking for a place as quickly as we can, and found an apartment that’s within our price range, but it won’t be available until the very end of September/beginning of October. Today while I was waiting on my kids to get off the bus, she put an eviction notice on my door saying that we needed to be out by September 18th, knowing full well that we will not have any place to go for nearly two weeks afterward. She brought her friend over and I overheard them laughing about “finally getting the stupid deadbeats out.” I don’t want to stay here any longer than we have to, but I also don’t want my children or our pets to be homeless, not to mention the furniture and personal items that we have here that would be lost. At the moment, it’s the five of us, plus two cats and an axolotl sleeping in a 10x10 room with one bed but we can’t afford to stay in a motel AND pay for the security deposit and first months rent. I don’t know what to do, Reddit. I know that after we leave, I am cutting all ties with her and she will no longer be a part of our life. I also know that it was a huge mistake for us to come here. 

Oh, and by the way, she isn’t sick and doesn’t actually need help, she just wanted my husbands paycheck so that she could save her money to blow on whatever she wanted. He has given her money for all of the bills to pay them in full, we bought groceries so we weren’t eating her food, but yet she still demands $500 for the room that we’re staying in. When we brought up that we had paid well over that in her bills, she asked us where else we could stay for “free” and said that we needed to be more appreciative of her “generosity.” So I feel like we were manipulated and lied to, and now shit has hit the fan for us. She told my oldest daughter that we could go “stay in a fucking shelter for all she cared,” and makes fun of the fact that my kids will be sleeping in the car soon. I try to keep them in the room with me at all times because she’s threatened to hit them, and my kids are terrified of her. It breaks my heart to hear my four year old ask me, “Why did Aunt Susan hit you, mommy?” or “Why is Aunt Susan so mean to us?” My two older girls are stressed out and have been crying since they got home over potentially having to be homeless and sleeping in our car. It’s not fair to the kids, and I just can’t believe that Susan would do something like that to them just to get to me. 

Honestly, Reddit, I would appreciate any advice on how to deal with this type of situation without getting hit or screamed at or worse, shot. Or advice on what to do around a toxic person like her? 

TL;DR: Husband, kids and I moved states to help my “sick” aunt. Turns out, she’s not sick, just batshit crazy and a hoarder. Emotionally and physically abusive to me and my daughters. Kicking us out soon and we’re all going to be homeless with no place to go. Aunt thinks it’s funny."
29,"Me [26F] with my co worker/ friend [28F] of 4 years, has taken offence because i didn't recognise her after a hairstyle change


I'm on phone and double spacing never works sorry 

Tl;Dr if ever someone changes their hair it's a 98% chance I won't recognise them or become accustomed to their new hair for a few months, I don't know why I'm like this and it's so frustrating, I also constantly mix up similar looking people with the same hair colour all the time it's so frustrating

I've worked with co worker Laura for years and she's always had long natural blonde hair , I would literally describe her as average weight average height genetic mid 20,s girl...we've always got along great.


Now Laura can definitely have her moody days but she's generally great to work with. 
The other day I came in to work and there's this girl with a reddish brown bob, she waves and says hi and I just blankly say hi back, there's a few moments of silence while she just looks at me, then it slowly and I mean slow as hell dawns on me that I know this person, I've already turned away to the managers office to ask if this is  the new girl as we were currently hiring.

When Laura asks from behind me, how's little Rosie any better? , I turn round and I'm just completely confused, Rosie is my daughter, I look again and it finally hits me, her voice is very generic, not recognisable, but I blurted out, LAURA? 

she said, what ! , I think she was literally alarmed, I explained I didn't recognise her because of her hair, and for some reason she took it really bad and said, Jesus Christ if you don't like it just say there's no reason to play stupid I'm not an idiot .


I tried again to explain that i reqlly sruggle to tell people apart and it's a huge problem when we hire a few teenager girls or boys at the same time as they all look identical to me until  I see them for months on end and even then if they change hair it's like a reset button. 

Laura's been cold with me ever since and the work atmospherejust feels wrong, wtf can i do if she won't believe me? I think there's something wrong with me and it only gets worse with age .

30,"My [29M] best friend [29M] passed away 2 months ago. I planned on proposing to my gf [26F] this fall but now I don't feel ready. Gf thinks I'm making excuses and threatens break-up.


We've been dating for almost 3 years as of this December. A year and a half ago we had a huge fight concerning where our relationship is going. My gf wanted to get engaged around the 2 year mark but I didn't feel like we were at that stage yet. We had some issues from earlier that we were still working through and I told her I needed to feel like we were past those issues first. The issues were from both of us. She needed me to be more transparent about my feelings but I also needed her to be less temper-driven and reactive. 

&amp;#x200B;

Anyways earlier this year we talked about it and after some pressing I told her I would feel ready for a proposal around the end of this year. However in June my best friend suddenly passed away and no one saw it coming. This was a guy I knew since I was 5. His parents basically took me in after my dad got abusive and my mom left. He was a brother to me. Anyways I'm still grieving and still dealing with knowing that I can't just text or call him anymore and I feel like my gf's sympathy is now wearing thin. She was supportive at first but last week she sat me down and had a talk about how moving on with our lives will be the best therapy. She said she wants us to keep to our own timelines because we can't let my friend's death affect our own happiness. 

&amp;#x200B;

Obviously I got the hint so I tried to be honest and told her that I'm not sure if I feel ready for a proposal/wedding this fall. I told her I'm still sorting through my grief and my heart just isn't in the right place. My gf got ridiculously angry and accused me of making excuses, saying that she knew that I wouldn't follow through. Hearing that really hurt since I'd already picked out a ring and everything. I just need some more time. Anyways we've been staying at separate places (gf with her friends) ever since the fight and she's been ignoring all of my texts and calls. I feel like I'm losing my mind I just can't deal with all of this. Before she left she said she wants to give me time to think things through about what I want, me or her. I guess this is her ultimatum. What do I do?  

&amp;#x200B;

tldr: My best friend passed away suddenly June. Gf and I planned on getting engaged this fall but now I don't feel right getting engaged just yet. Gf is angry and accuses me of making excuses. She says it's either me or her. I don't know what to do. "
31,"I (23F) have a tic that causes me to smile during inappropriate times. This has been triggering fights with my boyfriend (24M).


I involuntarily smile during inappropriate times since I’ve been a teenager. It happens during very tense moments. For example, when I’ve been in therapy and have talked about having suicidal thoughts, I grin uncontrollably. 

It’s especially bad when people are angry with me, and it has caused fights to escalate in the past between me and people I am close to. I will smile when apologizing to my boyfriend or when he is yelling at me, and I cannot stop unless I put my hands over my mouth. It makes him question my sincerity and confuses him. He will do things to antagonize me like laugh in my face when I am telling him how I feel because he thinks I am lying about not being able to help it. 

I know that people misread my emotional expressions, which is why I prefer to have intense conversations over the phone, but my boyfriend wants to talk in person when he is upset. I have been in therapy for a while, but it hasn’t helped and I am at a loss for what to do. 

tl;dr I smile uncontrollably when my boyfriend is angry at me, but I can’t convince him that it’s not intentional. How do I come off as sincere when we are having arguments?"
32,"My [25F] husband [45M] of 4 years died 2 months ago. I just discovered I'm pregnant with his child. I don't know what to do.


I know this is going to seem impossible to believe and I wish it was but I need help. I'll try and keep it short but I'm freaked out so sorry if I ramble. 

My husband ""Charles"" and I were married for 4 amazing years. I loved him. He was my rock and my world. He was killed in a car crash driving home from a guy out of his mind on drugs about 2 months ago. 

I've been trying to put my life back together ever since but now I've hit an even worse roadblock. 

Charles and I were trying for a baby around the time he was killed. And yeah, as it says in the title, I found out two weeks ago I'm carrying his child.

It was a weird combo of emotions when I found out. Horror and revulsion and sorrow mixed with disbelief and joy. I'm now terrified out of my mind.

Yes I was trying for a baby with my husband but that's because I planned on us being parents together. Not all by myself. And now I'm stuck and torn on whether or not I want to keep the baby.

I can't ask my family because, god love em', they are religious and would disown me for having an abortion if I went that route and would not allow me to adopt out my child. I can't talk to my friends because they are all biased one way or the other and I'd receive a ton of judgement no matter what I did.

It's even more complicated because of my darling mother-in-law. She's not religious but Charles was her only child and she was really looking forward to being a grandmother. She wanted it so badly. The only person who has come close to me being as destroyed by Charles death has been his mom, because she lost her only child and now she will never be a grandmother. We've always been close but you can bet she'd never forgive me for aborting to adopting out her only son's child if I decide to do that.

I know I was trying for this baby. Believe me I'm consumed with guilt for even considering anything besides keeping it but the truth is ever since my husband died my world is upside down and everything I once desired has now shifted. I wanted a family. I never wanted to be a single widowed mother. I am *not ready for this you guys. I just lost my husband.* 

This could go on and on so I wrote down in my journal the reasons why I want to keep the baby and reasons why I don't.

REASONS I WANT TO KEEP THE BABY:

1.) I do love this child already. I do. It's the last living remnant of Charles. He or she may look or act like him. It's literally the sentient embodiment of the love between my late husband and me. If Charles was alive there'd be no question I'd be ecstatic because before he died this baby was wanted. But Charles isn't alive anymore

2.) I adore my MIL. Truly. I love her more than my own mother tbh. She'd be an absolutely incredible grandmother and she wanted it so badly. This is her last chance to be a grandmother. If I don't keep the baby, she will never get that chance again. 

3.) I know it sounds old fashioned but the thought of Charles ""line"" dying out breaks my heart. To know that that's the end of him forever with no one to carry on his name, genes, anything is soul crushing. By keeping the baby a little piece of Charles will live forever. I'd get to have him with me and he'd live on in a sense and not just be...gone

REASONS I DO NOT WANT THE BABY:

1.) Guys, point blank, I am not ready to be a single mom. I'm just not. The thought of having to arrange for day care, baby sitting, working all day and coming home to a screaming needy baby, then tantrum prone toddler, then emotionally need child with no rest or real help for the next couple of decades fills me with fear and anxiety. Yes my MIL could help *some* but she's very old (74) and not in the best of health. I suppose I could always move near my family but honestly I don't really like them and am not close with them. I'd also have to arrange a move, find another job, etc. it just sounds like a nightmare and headache I frankly don't want to deal with. I like my job and I love where I live and do not want to move. 

2.) I know this is going to sound contradictory but the baby would remind me too much of Charles. I'm not sure I could not resent the baby or want it away from me because he or she would be a constant reminder of what I lost. I can't state enough how much I loved my husband and how much his death has killed me. Part of me just wants to move on and I won't ever be able to fully do that because his child will always be there as a reminder of what I lost.

3.) Please don't hate me for this but it needs to be said. I absolutely don't want to right now, but eventually with time I'm going to want to date again. I know I'm young and I'm not naive enough to think I'll grieve in sackcloth the rest of my life. Eventually I'll want to date and find love again. Dating is so much harder if you're a single mom with full custody. It's an instant deal breaker to so many men. Plus since I'll have full custody I just won't have time to date. And I don't want to right now but eventually in a few years I will. I want to be carefree and not have to worry about finding someone decent and willing to put up with my situation, arrange babysitting, taking it super duper slow, etc. And even now I just want to be alone to mourn and grieve and be independent and not answer to anyone. I won't be able to just *be* if that makes any sense and work through my grief. I'll have a pregnancy to deal with and then an infant. I won't have time to just be by myself and be alone without any pressures or demands on me. 

So I guess that's it. Please don't be too harsh on me and I'm so sorry if I sound cold and clinical. I'm not an unfeeling cyborg I'm just very stressed and tired and sad and scared.

I guess I should also add that adoption isn't really something I want. I wouldn't want any of my family to adopt my baby because I know how I was raised and I really don't want my baby to go through that. I wasn't abused per se but it wasn't a good childhood. My MIL, god bless her she'd certainly want to, is just too old and sick to take the baby. And I'd feel so guilty being on the sidelines of me and Charles baby. If I had to adopt I'd want a closed adoption but a. I don't know how I would conceal my pregnancy for 7 months and b) The thought of handing me and Charles child over to (albeit a loving) strange family and never seeing them again is so horrible. I'm afraid I'd chicken out but then resent the baby or be a bad mom. So I really would rather just either keep the baby or have an abortion, adoption is really not something I want to do.

I don't have a lot of time to make this decision. I'm still within the legal time frame for getting an abortion but I won't be for long. I just need some perspective guys. Thanks.

**TL;DR My husband died unexpectedly a couple months ago and I just found out I'm pregnant with his child. I don't know what to do. Please help me.**"
33,"I (20M) slept with my cousins (28F) boyfriend (31M) without realizing it was her boyfriend. I feel stupid and shameful over it and I can't tell anyone about it without outing myself.


My cousin and I went out to a bar for my birthday and she brought some friends. It was fun, and this guy Jacob was there. Now, I had no idea at the time, mostly because my cousin has been in spain for the past 2 years, but Jacob is my cousins boyfriend. They didn't really show any affection to each other, there was no real clue that this was my cousins boyfriend. 

Anyways, after 2 or so hours, my cousin and most of her friends had left, but me and jacob had kicked it off chatting and were sort of becoming good friends, so he decided to stay with me and my friends. My friend offered some molly to us, and Jacob was very excited to do it and took it right away (hes sort of a wild guy) and I decided to do it too, not my first time regardless. 

We had a blast, tried to go to another bar but got rejected (im not 21 yet lol) so he offered to bring us to his apartment, we went there and just talked a lot and got pretty drunk. I asked if I could sleep over because the trains stopped working, and he said sure. My other friends left and we stayed up and watched some tv. 

Eventually he sort of made a move on me, and we ended up kissing. I had never done anything with a guy before, but I did have some attraction to men, and he was a very, very attractive guy. We ended up sort of playing around with each other more than anything, he told me it was his first time too, and so neither of us knew what to do. Eventually we got more comfortable and sort of just fell asleep naked. I had a fun time, not sure if I would do it again, but it was fun in a sort of curious experimental kind of way. 

Here's the thing. I friend requested my cousin about a week later. I didn't have her on facebook, we didn't exactly see each other at all the past 2 years. I quickly realized from her Facebook that Jacob was her boyfriend for about the past 6 months. 

I just felt a lump in my throat upon reading that. I was shocked. At the bar, at his apartment etc he made no indication he was dating my cousin. Idk if he did that on purpose because he wanted to sleep with me? I have no idea honestly. After we did the MDMA we basically exclusively talked about music and artists and politics and stuff, nothing personal. Or well we talked about our home towns and that we both loved new york. But that's about it.

Here's the big dilemma. My cousin, and by extension my entire family, is viciously homophobic and religious. There is no easy way to tell my cousin that her boyfriend cheated on her without also outing me. I love my family, and I really don't want them to hate me over this one incident. I don't even really consider myself homosexual that much at all. I think pretty much all of my curiosity has been drained from that incident. 

So what do I do? Let this slide? Try to reach out to him? 

TL;DR -  - Slept with my cousins boyfriend without realizing it was her boyfriend. Not sure what to do without outing myself as having fucked a man.

34,"My boyfriend [32 M] tells me [26 F] that I should just stop acting dumb if I don't want to be verbally abused


I've been with my boyfriend for 5 years and he's extremely verbally abusive and has been physically abusive on the past too. He's a successful CEO of a business and always uses it against me. I used to be very smart, I even qualified for MENSA (not bragging at all), but all he's done for 5 years is call me stupid , a dumbass , useless and worthless and now I don't want to live at this point. I don't know how to leave. I feel stupid now. He says if I wasn't so pretty I'd be useless and I have zero confidence as it is because I feel dumb.  He won't go down on me unless I become ""normal"" and stop overreacting. He says if I don't want to be called stupid , stop doing stupid things. I don't know myself anymore. He considers stupid things like me not closing a carton of eggs properly. He will say I don't know how the world around me works and I'm clueless as to how to do things properly. I am always second guessing myself . I don't know anything anymore. I don't know what to do. 

TL;DR! My boyfriend of 5 years keeps verbally abusing me and I don't know how to leave

35,"My Mother and sister in law judge and call me names after I [F31] miscarried early this year. I feel husband [M33] doesn't do enough to stop this.


Husband and I have been married for 3 years. When we tried to conceive early this year, I got pregnant right away so both of us have no problem with fertility. It was my first pregnancy and with this very first one, my husband and I discovered that I am not that tolerant to high fluctuations of hormonal imbalance. I suffered chronic anxiety and insomnia during the pregnancy and I was prescribed anti-anxiety and sleeping-aid medication. My condition got worsened each week until I miscarried at 11 weeks. My anxiety and insomnia continued until after I got my first period following the miscarriage.

Mother and sister in law never sympathized with my condition. Since the beginning of pregnancy until we lost our baby, they never asked about my condition nor congratulate us. After we lost the baby, things got worse. I was really weak and emotionally exhausted after I lost our baby and needed to take some time off from work. My mother and sister in law called my husband to tell him that I am ""spoiled"". They kept asking him when I was going to get back to work. Mother in law also told the rest of my husband family that I am too spoiled to carry a child and have mental health problem everytime I am pregnant. They call and text my husband saying bad things about me until today, something like 

"" Your wife is mentally unstable (referring to my anxiety during pregnancy) and very spoiled, she won't be able to carry a child for you""

""Her family lied to us. They should tell us that their daughter has mental problem (referring to my anxiety during pregnancy).""

""She wouldn't dare to leave you. Who wants to marry her knowing that she has mental issues when she gets pregnant? So you have to take actions because you are still young""

&amp;#x200B;

I know my in laws only talk bad things about me to my husband and my husband doesn't change despite what they say about me. But I am still annoyed and want some PEACE in life.  All they say about me is UNFAIR and makes me really furious that I can't do anything about it. What did I do wrong from my miscarriage? Is it even fair to insult me just because I miscarried, what did I do wrong? My husband has been dismissing their comments but they don't stop. I feel my husband can do more but how?

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR: Mother and sister in law bully me. They make comments about my ability to carry a child and call me names since I miscarried early this year. I feel my husband doesn't do enough. What should my husband and I do to stand up for us?"
36,"I [26f] got married a few months ago. Now it feels like I’ve been kicked out of my “old” family [M56, F55, M19,F17]. This really hurts and I don’t know what to do.


My family was always very tight-knit when I was growing up. 

The five of us were always doing something together. Mom took my sister and I on spa dates once a month, dad frequently took us all camping or out to dinner on the weekend.

Every summer since I can remember we have always gone on some big road trip. My favorite memories usually involve being packed in Dad’s truck with my siblings watching mile marker infinity slip by in Southern Nebraska.

Anway, married now [to 28m] if that matters. I’ve been seeing my now-husband for six years, so it was hardly out of the blue when we got married last January. My parents and siblings all seemed to love him. After we’d been dating for a while Dad invited him along on some of our camping trips, he was a frequent guest at their house for dinner.

Mom and Dad were thrilled for me when he proposed and Dad even went as far as telling my husband he was relieved I was marrying someone like him. 

So I don’t know what gives.

Like, as soon as I tied the knot it was like I got kicked out of the family. Mom didn’t call to invite me to spa day with her and my sister anymore. I have paid my own way on those since I’ve been financially independent, so it can’t be a money thing, and I’ve gone with them at least monthly. I always thought we had a great time!

But now I only know about them when my mom posts about it on facebook, usually with a title like “Mom-Daughter spa day!” which kinda twists the knife.

I asked my mom after the first couple times why I didn’t get invited and she said because she figured I wanted to spend my time with my new husband. And I tried telling her that I can afford to soend a coulle hours away from him *monthly* and she gave me a non-committal “Oh, okay.” But she still doesn’t invite me and it’s makijg me feel like I’m just not supposed to come.

Its the same thing with dinners. It used to be I would go over to their house one night a week for some big family dinner. Dad would make soemthing on the grill, I’d help mom inside. Sometimes my husband would join, but most of the time not, and it was really nice to be just around the family.

But now I don’t get told about those, either. If I ask about having dinner one night a week my parents usually respond something like “Oh, feel free to come by whenever.” And when I show up they just tell me I can hear up something from the fridge, because they already cooked something big a few nights ago *without telling me!!*

And what really broke me was in early August. I knew we were running out of time before my siblings had to go back to school so one day I texted my brother to ask if mom and dad had said anything about the family trip this year.

Bro responded that they were taking a road trip to a big national park out west. I got a lump in my throat that I had apparently not been informed about this, either, so I asked bro if I was welcome on it. He said he had to ask Dad, then a few hours later hit me back that “They only made reservations for the four of us.” 

And I guess that just did it. I called my brother (because I didn’t really know what I would say to mom and dad right then) and begged to know why I was being excluded from all of our old family stuff. My brother told me “I’m not sure, but I think Dad just wants to keep it the [my maiden name]-family trip. You’re not really a [maiden name] anymore. You’re a [my married name] now.”

I don’t think he meant that quite as maliciously as it sounds, but it was still too much to hear and I just hung up the phone so i could go cry.

My (former?) family got back not long ago and their facebook pages are all covered with pics of them having fun together and apparently not missing me one little bit.

I felt a little better for a while because after I went and cried on my husband’s shoulder about all of this he managed to scrape together some time off and took me on a little road trip of our own. It was a wonderful trip and an amazingly sweet thing of him to do, but I’m still so incredibly sad that I’m apparently not a member of my “old” family anymore.

And I feel kinda bad for being sad because my husband is really trying to make me feel better and making dinners with me and he’s gotten me a couple weekends at the spa, and I really do appreciate that, it just doesn’t really help the underlying sadness that my family I guess just doesn’t want me anymore.

Why would my family drop me like this? Just because I’m married? I wanted a bigger family, not a *new* one! And what can I do to help my husband understand that I do really appreciate his efforts, but he can’t make the hurt of being kicked out of my family just go away?

**TL;DR**: I got married a few months ago. Ever since I’ve been dropped from pretty much all activities from my previously very tight knit family and they act like I’m not part of their family anymore. Why? How do I address it?"
37,"My [23F] loving dad passed away a while ago. My family cannot afford to get him a proper headstone. I want to pay for it, but my fiancé [24M] doesn't want me too even though we have plenty of money.


My dad and I had a very special bond. He was my everything. He passed away last Father's Day suddenly and in a very traumatic way which (I won't get into.) I'll just say that I held him to the very end. It was the worst thing that ever happened to me and on Father's Day of all days. 

My family is very poor so he was creamated and buried. He doesn't have a headstone, just a tiny grave marker, which bothers me a LOT. I loved him so, he deserves a proper memorial because he was truly the most wonderful person I have ever known and he gave me everything. 

I recently got my first job as an RN and my fiancé works in the space industry as an engineer. He makes plenty of money for us and happily provides. We keep all our money together. But now since I got a job, I am more able to contribute and save for things I want. I don't have a ton of money since I just started, but the job pays well and I have enough that it would not really affect our financial situation to buy him a headstone.

My fiancé thinks it's not a good use of my money. I have a lot of broken teeth and I have always wanted to get them fixed cosmetically. My fiancé thinks this is a better use of my money, but I disagree. I can live with broken teeth a little while longer and it's not nearly as important to on me as giving my father a proper memorial. I think it would improve my mental status from the trauma of what happened to know he is being remembered properly.

How do I approach this? Thanks.

38,"Boyfriend keeps correcting my family dynamics


I've been talking to this guy for a few months and things are great other than this one thing. We are both 29 years old.

&amp;#x200B;

I have a blended family.. like a lot America. It's not unusual. I have 4 siblings who are all technically ""half"" siblings. My family and I are very close and I am close with my siblings. I never think of them of ""half"" siblings and its the same for all of us. We are not less of a family just because we are technically ""half"" siblings and not ""full"" siblings.

&amp;#x200B;

Anyways, during conversation quite a few times now my boyfriend will correct me when I say sister or brother. He well stop and say, ""oh, well your half sister/brother"" - along those lines. Even as far as one day I mentioned my brother-in-law and he stopped and corrected me saying, ""you mean half brother-in-law"". The first time he met my sister while having dinner at her house, he asked twice to both of us, ""You have the same dad right?""

&amp;#x200B;

wtf?! At this point its almost offensive. I know what they technically are and I don't need him correcting me.

Am I being overly sensitive or is this weird that he keep correcting me?

39,"Is it weird to bring a friend with me to purchase an engagement ring?


Hi. So earlier this year (January) my girlfriend (22F) and I (22M) looked at engagement rings for fun and she found one that she liked. We've been together for years now and we've openly talked about getting married and I'm planning on proposing at the end of this year (December-ish.) I have terrible anxiety, and going to purchase the ring is something that's terrifying just in the fact of talking to people and not knowing exactly how it works. My question is, would it be weird to bring a close friend to go with me when I purchase the ring? He's the guy I want to be my best man and It would be huge for me to have someone else there just as moral but I also don't want to break any unspoken rules or be looked at strange by the associates at the jeweler. Any thoughts?

Tl;dr: I'm anxious and want to know if it's weird to bring moral support to buy an engagement ring"
40,"Did I [31F] do the right thing when it comes to [32F?] We were best friends for 20 years.


About 5 years ago, my best friend fell in with an abuser. I know that happens. I texted her, telling her I was there if she needed to get out. She'd vent to me, tell me what was happening... I kept begging her to leave. She kept telling me they'd have breakthroughs, they'd go to counseling. They would go through the cycle of abuse for three years.

Two years ago, he finally hit her so hard she lost consciousness, broke three teeth and her nose. I was her first call after the cops at the hospital. She was pressing charges and going to leave. I offered her a place to stay, she got a PFA, and he got to rest his head on a prison pillow for a night or two.

She stayed with me for a month. He did not know where I lived because she didn't. He kept such a tight leash on her that she wasn't allowed out and I wanted to be her safe place. 

Around the end of that month, I came home to him sitting in my living room, watching TV while eating my food. She wasn't working while she healed. He was homeless and she said he was sorry, was getting anger management, and wanted to work it out.

I told her, right then, that she had 30 days to leave. He got a wee bit aggressive. I called her parents, told them to come get her *and* him (which pissed them off, too.) They did.

She tried to resume the friendship like nothing happened a week later. I ignored her messages. Pictures of presents, their new apartment from the money her parents lent her... she acted like it was fine.

I'd get late night SOS messages from her, begging me for help. I called the cops each time and also forwarded the messages to her parents/brother. I never responded except for the one time I sent her a line for DV hotline/shelter.

She has finally left him and has been gone for 6 months. He put her in the ICU. Her parents and brother texted me, asking me to come. I declined. She texted me when she got better, I didn't respond.

I don't know why, but I have zero sympathy. I do not want this person in my life. She violated the sanctity of my home with him. I ended up buying a better security system and keep all doors and windows locked at all times. This summer, I had a gate put up that can be accessed only by a keyfob. 

She sent me a long text last night, telling me I was throwing away 20 years over a simple mistake and that she needs me, I'm her only friend. I sent her a reply that said, ""No, you threw away 20 years by bringing him into my home."" She hasn't answered.

Am I being too harsh?

TL;DR: I helped my friend move away from her abusive boyfriend. She brought him into my home without permission. I cut her out of my life, bought a better safety measures, and have spoken to her twice since."
41,"My Dad [M 43] cheated on my mom [F 43] - and my mom and I [M 19] found out because he sent an email meant from his new GF to us.


This a bit surreal for me so I apologize in advance for my emotion in this post.


 I - along with my mom - discovered that my dad was cheating on her because he accidentally sent a message meant for his new girlfriend in an email to my mom and me. (What a fucking idiot, I know.) 


As my parents have always fought, I guess I expected a divorce (I’m 19, no siblings, and they’ve been married 20 years), but I never thought about cheating. This is especially hard for me because I am close to my dad - he is my role model and one of the best friends - but this is so two-faced it gives me stomaches. Additionally, I am not very close with my mom. 


The hardest part is that the email said that he “just got away” from my mom and me so he could meet up. In other words, he chose this person over being with me (and my mom) this weekend. I leave for sophomore year of college this weekend so to hear that he didn’t want to be with me is extremely painful, and unexpected.


I’m writing because I need advice:


1) how to approach my dad - right now I have no plans to talk to him, at least for a while. My mom - who I want to support in this especially difficult time for her - wants me to give him the silent treatment but tomorrow (before I leave) wants me to say all these things about how he lied to us, etc. she wants to keep the marriage, I’m 99% sure my dad wants to get a divorce. My mom believes that if I say the right things that make him reflect, he’ll realize he’s missing out on family things, repent, change, and come back. Personally, even though I think a divorce is solidified, I owe it to my mom to support her. 


2) how to approach topic with friends - my mom doesn’t want me to tell anybody because I don’t think anyone in our community would expect this, and as a result it’d become nothing but gossip and embarrassing. I have close friends that I certainly trust, but I’m worried that 10 years from now at my wedding or family events they’ll see my dad and presumably new wife with such disgust. I don’t want to be known as the kid with a dad that cheated on his mom, but I feel like I have to tell some people. I know my friends will support me, I just don’t want them to look at my dad so negatively. He is an amazing father (except this does break my respect for me), and a bad spouse. 

Thank you for reading and for any advice you have. 

**TL;DR: My Dad cheated on my mom. My mom and I both found out in horrible way and know I want to know how to approach my dad and if I should tell my friends**

42,"Me (30F)with my husband (31M): he spent my money on himself


I just recently turned 30 and as a gift my parents gave me a few hundred dollars with a card that says to ""pamper myself."" I was really excited because as a stay at home mom to a 3 yo and a 1yo, I've been either pregnant or breastfeeding for the last 4 years. I haven't even had the time to get a proper haircut. I told my husband about the gift and how excited I was to use it. I left it magnetted inside the card in the envelope on the fridge.

I went to use the money yesterday and it was gone. At first I freaked out because I thought my 3yo had somehow gotten it down, even though it was way out of reach. I called my husband and he point blank told me he spent it on a golf club. He basically said that he earns the money so he has a right to all the money the house. He hung up on me when I got upset.

He came home and I tried to tell him how I felt about it. By the end of the conversation, I was apologizing to him for not offering him the money before I made plans for it. Now this morning I'm feeling confused and hurt and like my thoughts got twisted around. I feel like that was my money to spend and I deserved to spend it how I wanted. Its not like my husband never gets to treat himself, he just went on a week long trip with his college buddies last month.

I'm not sure if I'm overreacting or being selfish. I don't know how to approach this with my husband either because I'm worried that he will make me more confused. Am I in the wrong here?

TLDR my husband spent my birthday money on a golf club"
43,"I think my [35f] husband [43m] of 12 years is in love with his cousin’s [42m] longtime girlfriend [40f].


*Throwaway since he knows my main username*

I kind of don’t even know where to start as I was just awakened by this nagging feeling of needing to focus on what’s been bothering me for a couple of days. Bear with me, please.

My husband, David and I met 12 years ago, got married pretty quickly, had our first child a year after we got married, had an awful first 3 years, and then got our stuff together, and fell madly in love. We have a healthy relationship full of affection, loads of laughing, and a mutual desire to spend a lot of time together. Sex life is normal save for often falling asleep too early to have sex more than once a week because he gets up super early for work, and I stay home with 3 children.

Everything was fine with this particular situation until recently. We’ve always lived too far from my family to see them regularly (they live 700 miles away), and his family was never interested in having a regular relationship with our small family, so we’re on our own in raising our children, and living our lives. We really only see his family at Thanksgiving when we host at ours.

At the beginning of the summer his cousin Jack, with whom he grew up, invited us over to their newly purchased house about 6 miles away, and ever since, we’ve been at their house almost every weekend, and once or twice during the week. They also come here. A few weeks ago, something came up about Jennifer (cousin’s girlfriend of 25 years), and the absolute reverence David showed for her was evident, but not that shocking, she’s one of those people who are just awesome. Also, when he likes someone, he has no issues showering that person with compliments, or showing his appreciation for them in their presence or not, but there was something different about the way he was speaking about Jennifer. I wasn’t jealous, and I didn’t even pinpoint my discomfort until I just work up at 5:30a this morning after being at their house all day yesterday to celebrate her birthday. Yesterday while we were there, he was talking to his other cousin’s wife Amy about Jennifer, and he was just talking about her when they were young, and how funny she’s always been, and how she’s always so gracefully put up with Jack’s shit throughout the years. How he was talking about her was intense. He was drunk, so everything may have been a bit more dramatic, but the way he was speaking about her was so intense, and dare I say, *passionate*, that at one point I said to Amy, “David’s clearly madly in love with Jennifer,” and I rolled my eyes with dramatic effect. Amy doubled over laughing (as she does), and David smacked his lips and smirked, waving me off, and then he continued whatever they were saying. Later in the night I was sitting in a chair with me feet on the ottoman, David was sitting on the ottoman, and Jennifer was standing in front of the chair, about 3 feet away, when David says, “Jennifer, you have such nice calves,” she’s like, “Really? They’re so big. I can’t even fit in regular boots, I need wide fit,” to which Jack (sitting next to me, but on a sofa) says, “Everything on you is big,” (she’s heavy, and they always banter like that), and then David comes to her defense saying how nice her legs are, and blah blah blah. He’s said that before, so I wasn’t surprised. He’s always had a thing for legs, and feet. He semi-regularly compliments a woman on these things, but usually just to me, not to her, and never in a disrespecting or disgusting way, but matter-of-fact. I’ve come to appreciate this characteristic in him because I just love anything positive from people. That all said, him going on about her calves was bothering me. We ended up leaving at 9:30 because he was already drunk (I don’t drink, and him drunk annoys me, and our youngest was well ready for bed). We got home, I put all the kids to bed, and he passed out on the sofa, and here we are now. He never tried to cuddle in bed last night, and usually when he’s drunk he turns that part up, but he might have just been conscious of the fact that I won’t have sex with him when he drunk, but my insecurities woke me and convinced me it’s because he’s thinking about Jennifer.

If you made it through this, thank you so much. If you offer solid advice, thank you a million.

**TL:DR husband showers his cousin’s girlfriend with compliments making me uncomfortable, and causing me to wake in the middle of the night convinced he’s in love with her**"
44,"My mother (55F) wrote in my (28F) personal notebook, but weirder than that


Not only did she read my personal notebook (journal, diary, what have you), but she didn't just leave me a note. She tried to \_blend it in\_ and make it look like it was something I had written. This happened several months ago and I just now discovered it; I had been writing about a depressive episode I was dealing with, ""Why do I feel and sound so insane"" and then SHE wrote, ""when I talk to my mom"". It caught my eye because I wouldn't write that, and then I realized that it wasn't in my handwriting, and remembered that I had taken the notebook with me on a visit to her a few months ago. 

I'm so appalled, I've never felt so violated. I'm also deeply disgusted with how pathetic and sick this is, what kind of  person does something like this? We don't have a great relationship, we haven't since I was about 11 or 12 and started having friends and activities that she couldn't be a part of or control. I left home at 19 and never looked back, I've been totally independent of her since then, but we do still have a relationship mostly because I feel guilty if we don't. She causes me tremendous amounts of anxiety. I don't feel like she's ever seen me as a person, but merely an extension of herself. I can hardly stand to talk to her as it is and if I want us to have a ""good"" conversation, I have a couple glasses of wine first. 

I haven't addressed it with her, both because I'm not sure how to but also because I have a feeling she'll pretend she has no idea what I'm talking about or brush it off as if it were a minor thing like she always does when I try to confront her about something. I don't think I'll ever be able to trust her, not that I did. I know I'm still angry but ultimately I just want her to get help; only a truly miserable person would do something like this. 

Maybe I'm just venting, but if anyone has any insight or experience or just anything at all, I would really appreciate it. I feel uncomfortable even talking to my boyfriend or friends who have met her about it because I'm so embarrassed for her that she's this insane.

TL;DR: My mom wrote in my journal, but tried to make it seem like I had written something about her (I know, it's insane)"
45,"Was told my [17 M] older sister [32 F] is actually my mom. Family has trouble accepting that I'm not bothered by this.


(For clarity, I'm going to refer to my family members as the people I've grown up thinking them as. So I'm calling my genetic mom my sister, calling my genetic grandma my mom, etc.)

A few weeks ago, the day after my 17th birthday, my family (mom, [52 F], dad [54 M], sister [32 F], and brother [33 F] wanted to hold a surprise family meeting with me to tell me something at a quiet part of the beach. They seemed very worried and I had felt that they were being especially awkward/overly nice with me the last few weeks, although I was unsure why. During the meeting they told me that my sister is actually my genetic mother. She got pregnant with me (by accident, not in any forced/traumatic way) during HS and didn't feel comfortable aborting or giving me up at the time, and they decided together that it was more beneficial to raise me as my grandparents child.

I'll say here that I thought I generally had a great childhood outside of maybe not the best financial situation when I was very young. Both my grandparents and siblings were very kind/responsible to me and they always got along with each other and myself. Never once saw a fight between them. We had a very stable and loving home imo.

At the beach they were all crying (even my brother) and were very emotional in a way I'd never really seen before. We're close and a ""lots of hugs"" family but this was super excessive even for us. I was obviously REALLY surprised (i thought they were going to tell me my brother was gay/parents getting surprise divorce out of nowhere/someone is sick with the way they were acting) so I had no idea how to react and overall was very casualish about the whole thing.

It was really obvious that keeping it bottled up for so long was driving them crazy and I think they expected a big emotional outburst of anger/sadness from me and I just didn't have one. Without going into the story in-depth the story they described was totally understandable and I don't think they did anything wrong. I didn't feel angry/sad/betrayed etc and it really doesn't change how I view my family. They basically kept repeating endlessly ""it's fine to be upset or mad, we understand"", and I kept telling them that it was fine and that I really am not. My sister especially did this and I almost felt like they WANTED me to be angry. it was very weird and they didn't respond well to me taking it well. I made a  lighthearted joke about it on the drive back to try and make them feel better and they did not take it well so I stopped.

Things have been just very nuts at home since. Everyone is walking on eggshells around me all the time. I honestly don't feel that much about this. Obviously it's a giant surprise but I still love/respect my family and don't view them any less than I did before. I have been VERY explicit in telling them this and it's almost like they ignore it every time. They are being very overly nice to me and very frequently repeating this very self-deprecating stuff about them being POS and it makes me feel awful. I heard my sister crying to my parents when I got home from school ""he hates me so much"" and them saying ""he's just angry at the situation, you need to give him time"" and I'm flabbergasted that that's seriously how they think I think about this. I literally hugged her that morning and had told her for like the 300th time that it was fine and I wasn't mad at all. 

They scheduled a family therapy appointment for tomorrow and I don't want to go because it's going to be two hours of this stuff. The whole thing is being framed like it'll ""help me let it out in a professional setting"". Like I'm crazy. They are acting like I'm nuts because I don't hate them and I feel hurt almost that they don't believe me. They have never acted like this before and I feel like it actually is making me crazy. I feel much worse from their behavior than the thing with my sister.

TL;DR: Family told me that my older sister is really my mom. All of them feel guilty about keeping a secret and were expecting me to be mad or upset, I'm totally cool with it."
46,"Grandma inlaw(73F) wants my husband(24M) and I(23F) to adopt our niece(4F)


A little back story, we are helping my husband’s grandma raise our niece. Her dad is prison and her mom passed away. 


Grandma’s health is declining and we are having to help more and more. She’s ok, she just has arthritis and diabetes so she’s in physical pain a lot. 

We recently got orders(military) to move 12 hours away. This would leave grandma and niece alone and that’s honestly, just not best for either of them.

Brother in law is supportive of the adoption. He will not be out any time soon. 


It sounds all good and wholesome on paper but I’m freaking out a bit. We have been together for 5 years but only married for one. We have been living together just the 2 of us for less than a year.

I went to college 30 minutes from my hometown and I’ve never lived away from my family. It all just sounds like a recipe for disaster but what other option do I have? I love my niece and I’ve always wanted children but we are still so young and inexperienced. 

Any advice?


TL;DR grandma’s health is declining so she wants us to adopt our niece "
47,"I (33M) found out my wife (34F) had an affair with a co-worker. I'm pretty lost... Can we be saved?


My wife (34) and me (33) have been married for almost 5 years and we've been together for over 10. In the last few years, sex has been difficult and somewhat scarce. She's rarely ever aroused or passionate towards me but she's not shut off from the idea and she does try. When we do have sex (around once every 8-10 days), it's great. We're both into it and it's fun. Other than that, our relationship seemed fine. We never fight, we laugh, go places, do things and we enjoy each other's company. Well I'd long suspected that she had something going on with a guy from work (who is married with a child). She gave me the usual lines like ""you have nothing to worry about"", etc.

​

Yesterday I saw her through a window texting this guy and then deleting the texts. I confronted her. After some back and forth, I got the truth (or at least what I think is the truth). She had an affair. It started off with flirting and texts. That elevated to a kiss after happy hour one night. This led to them getting a hotel room and having sex after work. She claims they've only had sex twice. They've kissed other times and she's sent him nude photos. They've had drinks without my knowledge and recently, she said that he would come into her office and give her a good morning kiss every morning (that one stung). She also got drinks with him at a wine bar that I've really wanted to go to with her but haven't yet (that one stung too). The only reason I found out is because she'd been texting him about breaking it off (or so she claims) because she found out that he solicited a prostitute from Craigslist and she was disgusted by it.

​

This has been so so hard. This woman is my life. I love her more than anything and I try to make her as happy as I can. After a very emotional and tear-filled day, she said wants to make it work and she'll do anything it takes. She apologized up and down, seemed genuinely remorsful and took responsibility for her actions. She never blamed any of it on me and said that she stopped trying with me instead of giving me my chances and talking with me about everything going on with us. She claims this was a wake-up call. She says that she loves me more than anything and loves her life with me but the sex part was a big deal which is why she did what she did. She said she began to think of us as more like best friends but she wants to get back to where we were in the beginning of our relationship. She said she did this because it was exciting, forbidden and he made her feel like she hadn't felt in a long time. She said it just escalated and happened (cliche).

​

I understand a one night stand. Shit happens (it shouldn't, but it does). But this, this was an emotional affair. She also still works with the guy but she claims that she's made it clear that whatever they had, it's over. I told her one of them has to find a new job. I want to kill that man and I want to tell his wife to ruin his life... but I won't because what's the point? My main concern is that the only reason she even broke it off with him is because he cheated on her (is that ironic?). Basically, if he didn't try and get with a prostitute behind her back, would this whole thing continue to go on? She says that she thinks that maybe subconsciously she wanted a reason out of the affair and this gave her one. Again though, if she was in to him enough to go through his e-mails (that's how she caught him), obviously there's strong feelings there. So he screws her over and she comes running back to me because I'm familiar and safe and I treat her right. I want to believe so bad all the things she said yesterday and she truly did seem like she loved me and didn't want us to end. How do I even move forward? Can I move forward? Can we salvage what's there and overcome this? I don't want to lose this woman. Everything in my life has her ingrained in it. She's my best friend. I love her so deeply but this is such an act of betrayal that I'm honestly unsure how anything could ever be right again. I'm so lost. Thank you for any advice or help you can offer.

48,"Had a baby 3 weeks ago, husband lends no help and I want to bail on my marriage. Isn’t what I signed up for.


Had our baby 3 weeks ago and to say I’m having issues is an understatement. 

This might sound like a rant, but honestly I just need to write this all down even though I’ll likely delete it later. 

I haven’t really slept in three weeks. I have a husband who when we decided to get pregnant told me he would be taking some shifts so I could sleep. That hasn’t happened once. 

I’ve been sleeping on the couch for three weeks because he needs his beauty rest. He doesn’t want to be too tired for work the next morning. 

I’m working from home too. I work damned near full time as a real estate agent. In fact four days after giving birth I had to do three eight hour days at a professional development course. It was excruciating for me to tell you the truth, I was having after pains that made me sweat through my top and I tore a stitch the first day. 
My husband “took the baby” those three days but his whole family was there the whole time helping him. They basically did all the child minding and left when I got home. His mother sisters and grandmother were all there those days, in fact they haven’t been back to visit since. 

I haven’t had a break. Not one. I have a breast pump and there is milk in the freezer and fridge but still my husband comes up with excuses for why he can’t take shifts and I can’t deal anymore. I feel like I’m suffocating underneath a pile of things to do. 

I write myself a list a page long every morning of things I need to do during the day, and I go and go and go and the list keeps getting longer. 

I’m falling behind in my own work, I do all the housework and shopping and meals. I work from home. I take care of the newborn and he gets to come home and sit on the couch with a beer and relax. He gets to come home and eat, sit in the hot tub then sleep in a nice bed for nine hours or more. Sometimes he holds the baby because I’m cooking dinner. That’s about it. 

The worst part about it all, is that he constantly complains. He gets home from work and complains about his sore back or feet. He wakes up from a 9 hour sleep and tells me he’s “so tired”. I tell him that I’m having trouble and he sort of just tries to tell me how bad he has it. He won’t just help out, he tells me about his shitty day and how he’s sore and tired but I’m going on week three and crumbling. This morning I tried to tell him how I needed help and he told me I was amazing, an amazing mother and that he was going to buy me a new car? 
No he’s fucking not, I work full time I have to buy myself a new car. My car is having problems on top of everything else. 

I’m not sleeping, my back hurts from the couch, it’s 2:00am right now and I can’t deal anymore. I haven’t slept at all yet. My keys are on the counter I want to hand the baby to him and drive away and not look back. 

This is not what I signed up for and I’m utterly burnt out. I can’t keep going like this much longer something has to give. 
I don’t know what to do, and I can’t seem to get through to my husband. If he asks me for a blow job one more time I’m going to punch him in the throat. I swear to god. 

TLDR: had a baby three weeks ago, work nearly full time, do all the chores and housework and get no help from husband despite voicing my troubles. "
49,"My boyfriend [21M] doesn’t understand why I [19F] didn’t stay at his house for his birthday after he raised his hand at me. Should I feel guilty?


So last month I visited my boyfriend’s house, a four hour train journey from my house. It was the first time I’d been there. I was supposed to be there for five days, including his birthday, the Thursday. 

On Tuesday night we had a huge argument about how uncomfortable I felt in the house. He kept leaving me alone to go and talk to his siblings, shouted at me about shutting the door too hard, and shouted about me leaving milk in the bowl after I had cereal.

After the initial row was over he sat for an hour calling me names and calling me ungrateful. I was crying and he suggested I stop before his brother or sister heard. He then got angry again and raised his hand at me. I flinched and was genuinely scared of him in that moment. He’s always been angry but I saw another side of him when I wasn’t in the comfort of my own hometown or home.

I left on the Wednesday, before his birthday. I just didn’t want to be around him. And whilst we did make up and have been doing okay, last night we had another blow up row where he blamed me leaving on our relationship going to shit. I don’t know whether I should feel guilty about it or whether I did the right thing. 

TL/DR: boyfriend raised hand at me and is making me feel guilty for not staying at his house after."
50,"My (17F) boyfriend (18M) did something that has made me scared of him. I am considering leaving him because of it.


An obvious throwaway here. 

A couple weeks back, my family received the devastating news that my cousin (17M) committed suicide. Whilst never close to me, this still hit hard. A family member the same age as me, dead. Since then, a series of medical issues in my family have put serious strain on both of my parents. And obviously, I feel a degree of stress from this too. 

I decided to confide in my boyfriend of eight months, let's call him Josh. So I tell Josh about what's been going on, and about how my mental health has been suffering from this (I'm my early teens I was anorexic and had a history of self harm, I know shits fucked) Josh stated he would have my back and that he loved and cared for me deeply. I believed all was well, until I saw his arms. 

He came to me today, all happy his usual self. Wearing a short sleeve t-shirt that showed his forearm where he had carved the word ""HELP"" deeply into his flesh. I was shocked, although retained my composure until I was in class away from him. I text him then, asking what the hell that was. He responded with ""It was going to say ""HELP HER"" as a reminder to keep you safe. I did it for us."" I freaked out, saying how that couldn't really be much more innapropriate and that I was horrified by what he did. He responded in confusion asking me what was so bad about it all. 

I told him that I didn't want to see him for the rest of the day. I needed time to think. He told me that wasn't possible that he needed to see me. My friends, let's call them Em and Ben, decided to take me outside as I was visibly upset. As soon as Em hugged me I burst into tears. Here's where the plot thickens. 

My father is abusive. Not to me, but to my mother. He used to hit her. Now he cuts, stabs, hits himself to stop it. As if that's really much better. So this outburst from my boyfriend shocked and horrified me. 

Josh gave me the space I asked for after Ben and Em removed me from the school bounds. Josh text multiple times apologising and trying to explain his behavior as ""to help you"". Near the end of the evening when I finally decided I had enough, I text him explaining why I was so upset, about my father, about it all. He said sorry again, then goodnight. 

I spent the day with Ben and Em, they talked me through what I should do. They believe the relationship is toxic and this is a massive red flag. I am inclined to agree, but I don't know. Maybe I'm jumping the gun because I'm upset. 

I am worried as to where the line blurs. When does doing things like carving ""Help her"" into ones skin become hitting me or someone else 'for us' apparently?

What do I do? Should I try make things work? Is this a sign of a sociopath? 

TL;DR : Cousin committed suicide recently, and family is going through alot. Stress is getting to me, I opened upto my boyfriend and he decided to carve 'help her' into his forearm and tell me it was to remind himself to look after me. Should I leave him for this type of behaviour?"
51,"My (36F) sister (35F) keeps talking trash about our youngest sister's (23F) wedding dress


My youngest sister isn't the most fortunate woman. She's 10 years younger than our next youngest sibling, and our dad died shortly after she was born. Our mom struggled with mental illness her entire life, but it got very rough after our dad passed. By that point, the rest of us were old enough to block out whatever she was doing, but my sister just completely fell for it all. There were a lot of mind games that were played, a lot of gaslighting and mental abuse, and there was a cycle of my mom just bullying my sister, then showering her with love and affection. It made her a really vulnerable, volatile person. She was always paranoid and afraid of other people, and binge ate to cope with her feelings. She was the heaviest kid in class, which came with bullying at school, too. Our mom passed away three years ago, and my sister still deals with the effects of her abuse. We've all been to therapy, and my siblings and I have said our apologies to her for not sticking up for her.

Anyways, my sister is getting married at the end of December, and it's a great match. She's always been a bit nervous about showing her emotions, even without our mom around, but she's just so excited. It's a small wedding, since she doesn't have many friends, and her only bridesmaids will be myself, our other sister, and our cousin. My sister took us all with her to shop for dresses at the start of the month, and we knew it would be a very big deal.

My sister is still heavy, and struggles with her binge eating. It's hard for her to find nice, everyday clothes that she likes, but a wedding dress is going to just be an added challenge. She's got poor self-esteem, so we wanted to really be there for her and make sure she was okay with everything going on. We spent most of the appointment just encouraging her to try on dresses or look at them, and hyping her up while she was in them. There was some crying, a lot of the dresses just didn't fit or looked horrible on her, and she was really disappointed. Towards the end of the appointment, we found her the perfect dress, and she just fell in *love*. It's not the most impressive dress, but I think it's very much in her style, and it's awesome that she gets to have something she loves.

After she tried it on, our other sister made some snippy comment about how it's not the dress she would've chosen, and it's too plain. I told her to just be grateful our sister found something, and that shut her up for a little bit. Lately, she's just been nastier about the dress. We got together to help make decorations, and my sister kept talking to our cousin, saying that she thought our younger sister should've chosen something more flattering, saying it makes her look like a sausage in a tube.

I don't know what to do. I tell her to stop everytime, and she picks a fight about it, telling me I'm being ""too nice"" about it, and to just suck it up. But, I don't think this is kind AT ALL. What should I do? Should I tell my sister about it?

tl;dr: My sister's been talking shit about our other sister's wedding dress"
52,"Boyfriend (25M) got asked out for coffee by a girl (20s?) he met while ordering food who is from his home country, I'd (25F) like it to be clear before they meet up that it's not a date. He thinks this is unreasonable. Thoughts?


We've both put our feelings in the post, so there's no ""side with the OP"" bias, and we'll both be reading the replies. We've also read over what the other has written and don't object to anything the other has said.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

**My stance:** My boyfriend is from a small European country and some time a couple of weeks ago, he met a father and daughter from his country while getting food. They chatted for a bit and then exchanged information and went their separate ways. A couple of days ago, she emailed him telling him a little more about herself and asking if he wanted to grab a coffee sometime.

​

​

The girl said that while she's from their country, she didn't grow up there, he thinks she grew up in Italy. For this reason, I don't really think she's longing for someone else from their country because culturally the country he's from and Italy are very, very different, but that's just my opinion.

​

​

Now, I am in no way saying he can't go. I would just like it to be clear beforehand that it's not a date, since asking someone to get coffee with you is a pretty common type of date in the US. He disagrees. He feels like it's fine for him to just tell her once he gets there that he's in a relationship and thinks it's not fair that I want it to be established beforehand that this isn't a date.

​

He's kind of conflated my position on this with him hanging out with any woman 1 x 1, which is not how I feel at all. Coworker asks to get drinks after work? Go for it. Click with a friend of a friend during a group hang out and want to hang out later? Sure! But this I feel is different since it's a random person from the street and he doesn't know her intentions, so I'd just like it to be clear beforehand. He says that there's no way to naturally bring it up, but I disagree, I think it can come up even while chatting back and forth before going out. He says he'll say it if I come up with a natural way to do it, but I don't think it should be on me to figure out how he should phrase it to make himself more comfortable with it. He thinks if he tells her beforehand she'll find it weird, and won't want to go.

​

​

Another thing that somewhat bothers me: He has friends here in the city from his country, but he doesn't want to invite them. He feels like that particular friend dominates conversations. Also, people from his country visit regularly and he usually tries to avoid hanging out with them because he doesn't care much that they're from the same country, so it's strange to me that he's so adamant that he should be able to meet up with this person just because they're from the same place now. He's not starved for attention from people from his country, he very regularly (daily) gets to speak the language. So I don't know why this is such a big deal that he gets to meet up with this random stranger from there.

​

I don't think either stance is entirely unreasonable, exactly, but he finds my position unreasonable when really for me it's a matter of comfort and not knowing the intentions of this other person. Maybe she does think it's a date and if she found out he's in a relationship she wouldn't be interested in going at all. He thinks nothing changes if he just waits until he's there to tell her that if it comes up naturally in the conversation.

​

​

**His stance:** I am from a small European country, so it's extremely rare for me to meet someone random from my country here in the US. A couple of weeks ago, I heard a girl and her father talk in my languages, so I talked to them, and I gave her my email. She has now reached out to me and wants to go grab a drink. While I don't care about people from my country in general, her story sounds interesting so I was down to meet up.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

My girlfriend thinks that I should specify that it's not a date beforehand. I don't see why that would be necessary, as I can just bring it up almost immediately when the conversation starts as I live and do pretty much everything with my girlfriend. Plus, I don't see how I can do it naturally, as I didn't think it had a chance of it being a date so I feel awkward randomly stating that it's not a date when, the way I see it, someone just invited me to share some stories and talk. I think that telling her that this would not be a date would make her think I am weird and not want to meet up.

​

​

We'll both be reading the replies, so just curious about what other people think in this scenario. Thanks!

TLDR: Girl from boyfriend's home country met him on the street with her dad, asked weeks later if he wants to grab a coffee sometime. I'd like it to be established beforehand that this is not a date, as he's in a relationship but he thinks this is unreasonable and he doesn't want to."
53,"My (20F) coworker (25m) is spreading lies about me in the company


I’ve been at an entry level position for about 6 months now to get me through college. I love my job and all of the staff, and we recently (2 weeks ago) hired a new guy who has been extremely disrespectful towards me. 

Started last week when I met him for the first time. He comes up to me on my break and says we need to do a secret handshake. Weird, but whatever. I hate to say this, but my first thought was that he was on the spectrum. Later during the same shift, he comes over and asks for my name and number on a sticky note. Weird again, because we are in different departments of the company and there would be no way we could cover each other’s shifts or anything. He makes a point to say “Don’t worry, i wont text you. I respect that you’re engaged” and points to my ring, giving me a little bit of ease about the situation. 

Fast forward to yesterday. He has texted me twice saying “whats up dude????” And “its _____ the handshake guy! Lol” which I have not responded to. 

And today. I come in for my shift (which he is not here) and the entire staff is treating me differently, but I can’t pinpoint how. I get asked by a few people how I’m doing and if i need anything to let them know. Weird, but whatever. Another coworker says, “Hey, i thought you and (by fiancé) broke up?” Which confused the hell out of me, so i ask what she meant. Apparently, coworker has told the entire company I ended my engagement, and told a few that we were going on a date. 

I’m young and I don’t know how to handle this situation, and it is beyond frustrating. 

TL;DR: new hire told fellow coworkers that I ended my relationship, and I most certainly did not. What do i do?"
54,"Me [25F] with BF [28M] of 3 years. Slowly realising we might not be long-term compatible but the thought of breaking up gives me panic attacks


First off, sorry if this is long. Me and BF, who I'll refer to as ""Ken"", became friends through work for 2 years, and have then been in a relationship just short of 3 years. I was never attracted to him initially but one drunken night at a work party later and we became pretty smitten with each other.

The beginning of our relationship was built on a lot of sex, fun banter and playful flirting. I liked how he different he was to previous guys I'd dated and how he was so 'opposite' to me, I found him really interesting. He liked how I was quite alternative and into films and gaming, but did initially make a few comments about how my entertainment tastes (like heavy metal music) were ""strange"" and ""effing weird"" but I would laugh these comments off and think he was just being funny.

My family have always been supportive of our relationship but they did used to make side comments to me about how our personalities were so different and how we don't seem as 'natural' as other couples. These comments always used to bug the hell out me but now I feel like I see it…

Some examples of things that worry me include:

•	We were invited to a big family trip down South to see my grandparents, along with my parents and my brothers family. They only have 3 bedrooms so they asked if we would mind sleeping on a blow-up double bed in the front room and they'd make sure it was private for us. I was fine to do this but Ken was not into the idea at all and complained about not wanting to 'slum it' in someone else's house. He looked at hotels which have cost £100+ per night and then decided to just not come. I ended up going by myself and had a GREAT time, possibly a better time than I would have had with him there.

•	My family have a very silly and sometimes immature sense of humour. Ken's family have a more 'mature' sense of humour and I find it hard to be myself around them.

•	I've always loved cats - I grew up with them and have a small tattoo of one. Ken, only having had one dog in his life, detests cats and thinks they can’t be trained and will shit all over the kitchen while you're not home. He refuses to ever compromise on getting a cat even if I were to be the one that solely looked after it and we got a dog too. 

•	Speaking of compromise, we currently live a 45 minute drive from each other and have been discussing moving in together. We both work in the same main city and he has a commute time of an hour each way, whereas it takes me about 40 minutes. I think it makes perfect to move closer to main city because 1. We're young and I’d enjoy living somewhere with more of a buzz, 2. Both of our commute times and travel costs would be greatly reduced, 3. We would both live an equal distance from our home towns. Despite this conversation, Ken has made it clear he would prefer to stay as close to his current home as possible because it's familiar and he likes his current gym. In that scenario I would be the one with a more stressful commute and the cost of my transport would double. 

•	I am a very laidback person and rarely get angry or stressed out about things, whereas Ken can get stressed out very easily. His family joke that he is a young version of this Dad, which scares the crap out of me because I know for a fact I could not spend my life with someone like his Dad, who is a control freak. One example of Ken's negative moods is how he narrates when he drives and will get annoyed by any other driver who gets in his way or does something that he wouldn't do. God forbid the other driver is a woman and he will make comments like ""Typical!"" or ""what a bloody idiot"" which most of the time is a complete exaggeration. I have repeatedly asked him to please stop getting so stressed out when I'm in the passenger seat as it makes me uncomfortable but he has only slightly improved on this. 

•	I have quite a lot of tattoos and would love to get more, whereas he doesn't have any and never plans to. When we first got together he was very indifferent to them and would ask things like ""but don't you worry you'll regret them or they'll look bad when you're older?"" which is a very frustrating thing to hear and I started to feel like he found me unattractive.

•	Our friends are worlds apart and he still hasn't met a lot of my social circle because I'm worried he'll judge them or not find them interesting. My friends are quite 'nerdy' and Ken does have a history of judging people if they're a bit different or have 'alternative' appearances. I once discovered he took a picture of a random woman whilst he was on a work business trip, because she was fat and he thought his sister would find it funny. The first time I ever met his best friend, ""Steve"", they immediately started discussing the appearance of a girl one of their friends had started dating and Steve asked for my opinion on her looks before even asking about myself. 

•	Ken is obsessed with sports and he and his dad will attend games and spend their free time watching other games and highlights reels on TV. I used to think it was great that he had a hobby but we often have to plan our weekends around if his team are playing or not, and if they lose he will be a sad mood for hours. We went on holiday with his family last Summer and he spent hours every day checking his twitter and sports feeds and reading out team updates and game scores to his Dad. It got to the point where me, his mum and sister had to repeatedly tell him to shut up and remember we're on holiday.

I feel like we've sort of gotten along harmoniously for the past 3 years because I'm not afraid to call him out on his shit and we do have a laugh together. I don't think he has any concerns about us at all and always seems really happy to see me and talk to me throughout the day. 

But I've reached a point where I'm thinking about my future and the thought of moving in with him is terrifying because I don't think he's my soul mate. I find myself fantasizing about fictional guys I could be meeting who I have more in common with and I'm finding sex with Ken less enjoyable. 

I'm terrified of saying anything because I know that he'd be completely blindsided by it and he'd be crushed, and our families would probably also be incredibly surprised (his more than mine). 

We also have multiple holidays and trips planned together over the next 12 months, including a weekend break my uncle has paid for us both to join, and a holiday abroad to celebrate my birthday later this year. I feel like I'd be throwing away 3 years and a lot of money we can't get back and ruining flight and accommodation plans, etc. I'm having anxiety attacks because all I can think about is how confused I am by this situation and if I should just 'wait it out' and see if my doubts go away.

Does anyone have any experience or thoughts on what I should do in this situation??

Tl;dr: Feel like I should have listened to my family years ago when they pointed out how incompatible me and my BF seem. I don't know what to do about the situation and don't want to upset anyone or ruin our holiday plans… Having major anxiety thinking about this situation.

55,"My[23F] boyfriend[29M] has been posting my nudes on tumblr for a year


So yeah. My boyfriend of almost 5 years started a tumblr page a year ago as us(we're apparently a couple who are porn fans and horny...) and posted my nudes all without my knowledge. I'm just totally at a loss. He's been reposting porn every single day even though weeks ago we both promised each other we would stop looking at porn so we could have a healthier sex life. He's commented on other women's porn tumblrs about how much ""we"" love them and ""we"" think they are sexy. I just. My brain can't process this. I don't know what to do. I think this is finally the last straw, I've had issues with his lying since day one but I've been stupid enough to stick around. Fuck.

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR- my boyfriend posted my nudes on tumblr now I don't know what to do. "
56,"[UPDATE] My [23 F] boyfriend's [28 M] best friend's wife [33 F] is a bit too much of a controlling people-pleaser and it bothers me sometimes when she overdoes things with my bf.


Hello all!

My old post can be found here: https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/8nfmxd/my_23_f_boyfriends_28_m_best_friends_wife_33_f_is/

but here's the tl;dr if you don't want to bother: 

&gt;tl;dr: Boyfriend's best friend's wife is controlling and overdoes things, especially involving my boyfriend. It seems like she does this because she's oldest. She tries to manage everything, even my private convos with her husband (she'll make references to what he and I talk about), and tries to tell me things about my boyfriend. It feels like she's used to being the only woman in his life and isn't budging with trying to back off a bit. I'd hate to have to talk to them about that, since I'm new to the ""group"" and it's not my place to come in and change things. I wouldn't ever do that to their friendship, regardless of how bad she seems, I'm certain control in her life is good for her.

&gt;Another thing I didn't add to my original post is that she always seemed to be aggressively joking or teasing me in front of other people, making me feel completely inferior because I'm younger and because I don't know many people. She's one of those loud types that call you out for stuff with the whole ""***Come on now, yknowhatimean?! hahahah!***"" type vibe that can make things uncomfortable. Everything seems like a competition w/ her, she's always gotta be first and most important in the group.


---

It's been three months since I posted that!

My irritation grew more and more, as she kept one-upping me during every single conversation and outright trying to embarrass me in front of new people. I grew from passive-aggressive to outright aggressive. She messaged me asking me if I was okay, and we had a little conversation. The gist of that goes like this:

&gt;**Me:** I appreciate you checking. I don't quite enjoy the feeling of constantly feeling like what I do pales in comparison to someone else, or being made to look bad in front of my friends. 
&gt;A little banter is okay, but I don't like the 24/7 feeling like if I say something, someone is going to rebuttal with something that is meant to tease, always, especially in front of other people, and Honestly, I prefer to avoid those situations altogether.

&gt;I had hoped to not be made fun of *again* in *yet another place* but it keeps happening and I can say that I just don't like it.

&gt;**Her**: Understood. For what it's worth, at least the folks I know well don't think of you badly. We're just teasing and sarcastic at each other. It's a long-standing dynamic. It must not feel or look comfortable without the time behind it, though. I'm sorry for the alienation and hurt. I'll try and be more mindful, if you still want to hang out, and more clear too?

&gt;**Me:**What?! I like you a lot, which is why it was hard for me to even say this. I don't want to stop being around you because I like you and I think you're bright, incredible, amazing and all things under the sun. 

&gt;And honest, which I appreciate.

&gt;Time is a big factor, yes. I'm new to the group, and I gotta wiggle my way in, so finding a place is difficult too. But it'll get there.

&gt;**Her**: I'd rather know something sucks when it sucks. ""Dude. Not cool."" ""OH SHIT! I swear I meant-- I will be more x."" That's my style. I feel bad you feel bad :(

&gt;**Me**: Well, I don't feel bad anymore that we've talked about it. I'm afraid of talking to people about things because I don't want any drastic changes. 

&gt;I'm sorry, if it seemed like I was being an asshole for the past few days. Instead of taking the direct approach of simply talking to you, I tried to fix the situation on my end by being more... what's the word.... assertive. Which ended up being aggressive instead.

&gt;**Her**: To be fair, it was one-uppy and I thought it was our thing? But I was confused and disengaged pretty fast

&gt;**Me:**I was scared about the one-up thing!  That was really intense for me because I wasn't sure if we were being legit or if it was playfulness but now I know that you're okay with it.

&gt;Either way, I think you're wonderful in your own way and it makes me happy when you're happy. 

&gt;I have to learn to be clear, people can't read minds or moods sometimes. It's just a bit hard for me, being new to the group, and then immediately saying ""Nah this makes me uncomfortable!"" Because at the end of the day, I just have to go with the motions and learn what I'll actually be able to handle and speak out if I can't.

&gt;You and I haven't broken up!!! okay!! we're solid.


---

I'm glad something was finally said. Since that day, things had been different. We took a break (as far as I can tell) from posting in the same group chats, sort of gained some distance. I was worried that I had permanently did some damage but eventually things became a shared space again and it didn't feel like I was fighting to earn my place, I just melted in. 

She actually took some real mental space away (she's a bit mentally ill) and stopped posting as frequently, but when she started again, things were (and are) great! I realized she probably actually *needs* to be first in certain things, because she really could use the ""thanks"" from other people and she probably needs to feel happy.

I do like her and want her to feel better. 

As far as the boyfriend situation...

Initially after the post and advice, I decided to step up and ask him to do things. 

""Hey, can we do *such and such* without the other couple tonight?""

""Hey, let's watch something!""

""Wanna play something??""

(again, he was really the type to be *down* for anything but not initiate unless approached with an idea). 

I don't know what happened but I think things completely flipped and he would much rather spend hours with me doing *nothing* than with them constantly. He actually would always ask me to do stuff and come up with things to do! 

But honestly? I think it comes with the time of us being together. We have our rhythm now as a couple. 

In the beginning he'd say some alarming things that I would kinda correct and call to question, for example: 
(let's call her Fran)

&gt;""Fran made my buy the game!""

I let it rest a little bit and asked calmly and kinda like *hmm?*

&gt;""Fran made you buy the game?""

&gt;""..okay! Well, she didn't make me.""

&gt;""Ah alright. Well as long as you enjoy it.""

and he still makes it a point where, if we're hanging out, he'll actually ask ""Is it okay if I play with Fran for a little bit?"" (I never actually asked him or told him that he needs to ask me this stuff, it's something he's always done, just to be polite)

I say ""Yeah of course.""

""Do you want to join us?""

""Hmm... Nah it's okay! Imma go do somethign else. Have fun though~""

and we leave it at that. 

Now I don't feel like I'm actually begging for space with him because of her. I think I made it a point to actually mention to *her* how much I enjoyed and missed spending time with boyfriend. In our time texting, she'll ask me what's up and I'll *really harp on the fact* that I'm having *so much fun finally spending some time with him after he works all day*. 

I just kept it up, constantly *gushing* with my love for him rather than being angry at her for wanting to constantly take control over his plans. I think she just saw naturally that I'm here now to stay, I suppose, and that she doesn't want to intrude or anything.

It feels good. 

***tl;dr:***

I got a bit hotheaded and her and I talked about it. I expressed that I didn't enjoy being made fun of or treated like an outsider just for teasing-sake. We both expressed how much we appreciated each others' company and that we would learn to read each other better. 

I spent some time constantly gushing about how much I loved spending time with him to her, overdoing it at some points and I think she realized that she couldn't always be the one on his agenda. 

Him and I actually grew a lot stronger together, spending more time together than ever before, to the point where even if we don't *have* any plans, we still hang out and create plans (this wasn't always the case, we'd always just *plan* on things and if we didn't plan, we didn't hang out). 

Her and I are good. They *seem* to be good, I know they text or whatever but like I said, I could care less what they do in their privacy as long as my relationship is unperturbed by it. He and I are great! 

I want to thank everyone for encouraging me not to be passive-aggressive, sorry I couldn't follow that closely, but it was *killing me*. I also want to thank anyone that commented on the other post. 

Now all things are good and I'm really secure in my position in the group, as well as in my relationship.

57,"Update: I [27 M] think my crush [25 F] might be flirting with me, am I reading too much into things?


For reference: [my original post](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/98w9r3/i_27_m_think_my_crush_25_f_might_be_flirting_with/)



I have a happy update to my post which I am writing both to thank for the advice and because it turned out to be a rather amusing series of misunderstandings:



On my part:
* took forever to realize I liked her cause I am slow at developing crushes on people and even slower at realizing I have a crush
* assumed she wouldn't be interested because I tend to have little luck with women, am not very masculine and currently out of shape. Particularly when she seemed to like muscular guys.
* when she showed interest I was still in doubt that maybe it was simply her being friendly until friends + feedback from here confirmed it sounded like flirting

On her part:
* she initially thought I was gay because I had mentioned ex boyfriends, so she thought there was no chance until she learned I was bi
* she then suspected I was taken cause she saw a pic of me going to a theme park together with my best friend and was like ""shit he's going out with that hot girl""
* when I was worried about making her uncomfortable when I first was more affectionate she thought that maybe it had been just me being tipsy and was sad at me apologizing for it
* her asking for advice proved to be of little use cause the other friend that was there noticed nothing and another one also had no idea of how to interpret my actions.



We went out twice after that time I mentioned in the first post, first time she was late so we had little time and I didn't want to rush things so we only talked and cuddled a bit but still left with things being ambiguous. Second time I worked out the courage to kiss her (after hours of random chatting and me rambling on because I was chickening and could not make the first move), she kissed me back, then we talked about things and all the above misunderstandings came to light which was quite amusing.



**tl;dr: she is into me, we are both terrible at understanding cues and showing interest but eventually it worked out (at least so far)**"
58,"my (22f) bf (24m) cancelled anniversary plans 5 minutes before.


my bf and i were supposed to go out to brunch this morning for our 2 yr anniversary. we made these plans over a month ago. 5 minutes before we were going to leave, he got a call about going to a baseball game, which he accepted without a second thought. when i questioned him a little, he said he’s “not going to ditch people anymore” and walked out the door. but isn’t he just ditching me by cancelling our plans together? idk if i’m just being a whiny, needy gf but i’m feeling pretty hurt, confused, frustrated, and sad (we’ve had problems like this in our relationship in the past). i don’t know what else to say to him without sounding annoying and clingy, because that’s how he’s making me feel right now because i’m trying to explain to him why i’m upset he says it’s “no big deal,” but, to me, it is. i’m just disappointed and i don’t know what else to say. 
are my feelings justified or am i overreacting? 

tl;dr - do i have a right to be upset because of my bf cancelling anniversary plans right before?"
59,"I(29F) am so tired of dating after having a conversation with the guy(30M) I am seeing last night.


""I'm not in love with you."" 

Exhausted, I don't even feel sad, I feel extremely tired and exhausted. 

I've met a nice guy a little over two months ago, we have been seeing each other once a week, we have a lot in common, strong connection, at times I looked at him and secretly thought: could you be the one? Last night we had a discussion about our relationship, he told me that he is still in love with his ex girlfriend, even thought they've been broken up since half a year ago, he really likes me but he thinks it's not fair to me as he still has very strong feeling for his ex girlfriend, ""I really like you, but I'm not in love with you."" He said. 

I wasn't angry, I know he has his struggles too, at least he had the courtesy to let me know. On the way back I was thinking: I'm so exhausted. 

It's been 14 years since I started dating, I've fallen in love, had a few long term relationships, they never worked out, because of communication, distance, being cheated on, differences in our personalities, I was heartbroken every time a relationship ended, but I've always learned from the mistakes in previous relationships, always believed in love. 

But today, I feet like I can't, or I simply don't want to love anymore. 

Opening up yourself and getting to know someone is a lot of work, it can be rewarding and joyful, but it always hurts in the end, I feel like I've reached the point where I just can't do this anymore, it is a weird feeling because I'm not sad, instead I feel a bit emotionless, I can't be bothered, perhpas I'll never meet that person, perhaps I'll never know how it feels like to be in a happy, healthy long term relationship, whatever, I can't do this anymore, give someone my whole heart, get hurt, heal and tell myself I'll do better next time, then get hurt again. 

Is this ever going to end? Have you felt the same? I don't know if I still believe in love.  


TL;DR: my date told me he is not in love, I am tired of being heartbroken, lost faith in love, what to do?

60,"My [23F] (ex)boyfriend [31M] He's fat, lazy, won't get a job, I broke it off but he refuses to move out. Help.


We started dating when I had just turned 21....yeah. He treated me so well and I was smitten. I was so flattered that a guy in his late 20's found me attractive and mature. I was actually not mature at alllll not saying I'm a beacon of maturity now but compared to then, I've had a lot more experience.

When I graduated college I got an apartment with my savings from working throughout school. He was living with his mom (god this is so embarrassing. idk why it took me so long to realize I was dating a leech...) anyway I offered him to move in. I had a full time job I'd be able to support us until he found one too...

Surprise, that never happened. In fact I found out, from his mom, he's never held a job in his LIFE.

Now it's more than a year later. All he does is lay around watching TV and playing video games. He sleeps most of the day when I'm at work, then games until sunrise. Sometimes he's still up as I'm leaving for work. He eats an absurd amount of junk, leaves the packages all over the floor and can't be bothered to keep anything clean. He must have gained over 50 pounds since moving in with me. His hygiene is atrocious. He showers once a week maximum. Sex tapered off months ago because I just can't find attraction to a guy wallowing in such a lazy lifestyle, plus with days between washing his ass and genitals...... yeahhh no.

He sarcastically called me ""mom"" whenever I told him he needed to find a job. He called me nagging and said I was being controlling. I started to believe it, until my friends slapped sense into me. 

That was at the beginning of August. More than a week ago I finally made the decision to break up with him. I can't waste years waiting for him to change. His food budget alone is a drain on my bank account. 

Just like he won't get a job, he won't move out either, and nothing I say will convince him. I told him to go back to his mom's and he refuses. 

I'm not budging on this. I told him directly I'm not his girlfriend anymore, he can't stay here. He seems to care more about that than the breakup. He actually said ""it's fine if you want to break up but I'm not going to be moving out."" 

How do I make him leave??? There's no landlord who can enforce it because I bought the place myself. It's only a 1 bedroom so it's very small. It's so uncomfortable with him still here. He screams at me to leave him alone whenever I tried to make him start packing. His gaming setup is in the miving room, so I can't be in there, I have to stay in my room. I hate living like this and want him gone. I messaged his mom but she basically told me she'd washed her hands of him when he moved in with me (I remember at the time she was really glad to be rid of him haha that should have been all the warning I needed)

TL;DR how do I make my lazy unemployed ex-boyfriend leave my home after breaking up with him over a week ago? He's got no job and no rental lined up, refuses to look because he just wants to stay here. "
61,"[update] Partner [10 years married 3] (38M) wants me (33F) to stop salsa and bachata


Hi r/relationships

&amp;#x200B;

Link to my original post is here:

[https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/98iwpp/partner\_10\_years\_married\_3\_38m\_wants\_me\_33f\_to/](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/98iwpp/partner_10_years_married_3_38m_wants_me_33f_to/)

&amp;#x200B;

Thank you so much for everyone for your advice and sharing all your stories. This is the first time i reached out 'internet strangers'and i was in a very sad place.

&amp;#x200B;

 I think my favourite comment was from someone who asked if I married Don draper. That was so funny!

&amp;#x200B;

Husband and I have come to agreement with this so far:

* I will stop bachata and only do salsa classes
* i won't do salsa classes at the club venue anymore and do it at a salsa dance schooll with paid classes
* i will stay back for 45 minutes tops after class to practice dancing with class mates
* when we move to my parents, husband and I will start bachatta classes together so i can dance it with him only
* he may consider doing salsa classes then (doubt it)

I hope somehow, when we do the bachata classes he finally realises its not that seedy but i won't hold my breath and just stick to salsa my original passion. :)

&amp;#x200B;

Husband still does not understand at all how his gym activities and the handful of times he is out drinking late with his family and our friends compare to me dancing with 'strange men.' He said he would happily not do the late drinking or stay out new years eve if i was to stop dancing as he did not want to lose his wife, but felt that perhaps ""he has already lost me.""

I've assured him that he won't lose me, im finding me again, but i can guarantee that if he stops me from dancing, he will definitely lose me and i will resent him.

&amp;#x200B;

I've now done two classes - and realise how crap my dancing has been (i am only a beginner/intermediate level). I won't admit it to my husband but i think the one class i did taught me more then the 6-7 times i went out in the club setting. 

&amp;#x200B;

What i realised is that perhaps i enjoyed the social dancing as it was more challenging then the class as it then tested my following. The classes have been very informative and made me realised i need to buckle down and just do a lot of them and perhaps one day be able to do some more social dancing. 

&amp;#x200B;

The vibe after the classes are ok, lots of students just end up leaving once the class is done (like how i use to 5 years ago) and as everyone is at the same level it is not as fun dancing with someone experience who can lead the dance. I do miss the club scene though as it was so fun to have salsa, then bachata then the reggaeton music. It was like having a club dance/zumba session mid week.

&amp;#x200B;

I have also started full time work again so it has been a big adjustment. I haven't called the therapist yet but plan to in the coming months for just a mental check in.

&amp;#x200B;

Thank you again reddit.

62,"Co-worker ruins business trip...should I say anything?


I (55y F) recently attended a business conference, love my family but was looking forward to some alone time. The conference is gigantic and hotels get booked 6 months in advance.  Many folks from my company attended and were scattered throughout the city.  I scored a hotel close to the conference and due to limited availability they upgraded me to a king bed suite.

My co-worker (60 y F) was originally attending with her best friend (another co-worker), but best friend backed out at the last minute. They are so close that they share a room (by choice) when ever they travel. I was going to drive by myself and stop and visit my sister but those plans fell through so I agreed to ride in a car with her. She drove but we were staying at different hotels.

The issues started before left, she realizes we are at different hotels and tries to change to my hotel, they are obviously full.  She then tries to get me to call the hotel and get a room with double beds, I try and explain that my suite was the last room the hotel had available. She then decides I need to cancel my room and stay with her. I had to pay for my room up front, so ""no"" I am not going to cancel, nor do I want to...I do not want a roommate for a week!!!.

Co-worker then realizes she booked the wrong dates at their hotel- Mon- Fri verses Sun-Thurs, so she cancels her entire room. She comes in my office and exclaims that she will now ""have"" to stay with me or not attend. I just say something like...oh well, we will miss you!  When that did not work, she re-books her room for the original incorrect dates but still does not have a room for Sunday night. Co-worker now decides we will just stay 1-2 hours outside of city that night  and will drive in the first day.... 

I finally just agree to her sleeping on the couch for the one night. She stays that night, snoring loudly and we go to the conference. We return to my room to get her bags and I practically have to kick her out...why can't I sleep on the couch all week??  She starts in on ""how will I get to the dinner tonight? She does not want to drive and refuses to Uber by herself....would I Uber across down and pick her up? The restaurant is in the middle and I would be in the cab for 1 hour to get across rush hour traffic. Again, I decline, she somehow makes it to the dinner. After dinner, she wants ""walked to her car"" you can see it from where we are all standing to catch our rides. She gets very upset the ""gentleman"" in the group did not walk with her.

The next day, she complains that a homeless man scared her by her car and that she was awake all night from strange noises....she complains to every one that I got the best hotel and she is not comfortable at the one she is staying at and how unfair it all was...

The next night we have dinner with our company President, she gets lost driving because she refuses to Uber and her GPS will not work in a big city.  Another co-worker misses the beginning of the dinner trying to give her verbal directions. She was a block way and decides to head back to her hotel.  I was happy that someone else had to deal with her crazy!

She decides we are leaving after the conference on Wednesday (one day early), unless I agree to spent the night in her 2 bed hotel room. I am in her car and so sick of her neediness and whining , I just give up and we drive home arriving at 2 a.m. 

To top it all off,  she says that the 20 seconds I left her alone at the Service Plaza a man was ""following her"" and might have been a pick pocket.  She implies that my husband and I must not be close because I was so independent.

This is really long and I only listed half of the craziness....I will obviously never travel with her again but should I confront her on her behavior? She was very vocal at the conference about how unfair it was that I got a better hotel and that I would not let her stay with me.

TLDR; co-worker needs to learn to adult, makes me feel guilty for not wanting to be responsible for her on a work trip.

63,"My [34F] brother [36M] spends way too much on gifts and it's making me feel awkward.


TLDR: My husband and I were the victims of a drunk driver. My brother reacted by gifting us an expensive 4WD. I feel weird accepting such an expensive gift. 

My brother and I grew up extremely poor. My brother has always stood out as being special and excelling at everything he put his mind to. As a result, my father and mother both over-exerted themselves in order to make enough money to pay for all of the considerable fees associated with my brother's upbringing. 

When he was younger, my brother never really appreciated how much our parents sacrificed so that he could live the life he did. This changed when he was seventeen. During this time, my father worked almost 70 hours a week at labour intensive jobs in order to meet all of my brother's expenses. Eventually, his body gave up and he suffered an almost-fatal injury at work. This opened up my brother's eyes and something in him changed that day. 

Fast forward to the present and now my brother is a highly successful lawyer making an exorbitant amount of money. Despite this, he spends the bare minimum on himself, preferring to spoil the loved ones in his life instead. Put it this way: my brother drives a cheap Honda while our parents now drive a Maserati and a Tesla. 

To be clear, I don't have a problem with my brother spoiling our parents. My problem starts when he starts trying to spend large amounts of money on *me*. Now, I'm not as successful as him, but my husband and I do perfectly fine on our own. For the large part, I tolerate his behaviour. His gifts have been limited to spoiling my children and myself on special occasions like birthdays, and paying for our family holidays. I've so far tolerated his behaviour because I know it comes from a place of love, and I feel like an idiot if I were to kick up a fuss over his generosity. 

But his behaviour recently escalated. A few weeks ago, my family got into a serious car accident when a drunk driver drove straight into the side of our sedan. Thankfully, no one was grievously hurt but one of my children had to stay overnight at a hospital. At the hospital, we were discussing a buying a 4WD as a replacement car because it would be safer if we ever found ourselves in the same situation. This morning, my brother came over with an expensive looking 4WD as a ""gift to his nephew"".  


I know I should just feel grateful. But, honestly, accepting a gift that is probably worth more than $100,000 just makes me feel so weird (for a lack of a better term). Both my husband, and my parents, say that I should just thank him and accept it. But it just makes me feel inadequate, as if I'm incapable of supporting my family myself. Am I reasonable feeling this way? Or should I just get over it?

64,"My [19/M] bf is making me[20/F] have body issues.


So me and my boyfriend were having a conversation about how he feels like he’s not attracted to my body type. I’m about 5’7, 130 lbs and I would say I have an hour glass type figure if not to be too arrogant. I’m not like a model or anything. Anyways he kept saying about how he wishes I was thicker and more like the fitness instagram models he sees. “It’s just hard when I see all these beautiful Instagram models who work hard for their body and your just not doing anything”.

I mostly sat quite for this conversation trying to hold back tears. Now I’ll be honest I’m not like a gym rat, it’s just not my thing. I eat healthy and go on hikes and do some yoga at home, but I don’t do all that other stuff cuz it just doesn’t interest me, but he means a lot to me so I’m considering looking more into intense weight workouts and however you get thick. 

It just hurt cuz growing up I was really heavy up until about 2 years ago. I was around 250 lbs and it was hard because my mom would constantly drag me down. “Look how thin those girls are” “See if you lost some weight maybe you could finally be happy like those girls” Just the constant comparison along with many other hurtful and harmful jabs. But when he compared me to the models he sees online it just brought all that old stuff up.

So I’m wondering do I give working out a shot for him? 

TLDR My [19/M] bf is making me[20/F] have body issues."
65,"I [24 M] have struggled my entire life with emotions, and I just wanted to tell someone how excited I am to finally be able to LOVE!


 I know this isn't the normal content that is on here, but I have no one to tell and I need to shout to the stars about this.

I was told by terrible parents, doctors, exes, and my own brain that I would never find love, be loved, or be able to love. I deal with parts of my brain that actively try to ruin my life and relationships. I am terrible with understanding my own emotions let alone those of a partner. And I had accepted a long time ago that I would never find someone who could care about me.

But I finally have found her. The woman who finally made me feel something. The woman who finally loves me despite my problems and knows how to work with me on helping us overcome those issues.

We had an instant connection, something so powerful and authentic. We connected on so many levels and have exceeded all my expectations so quickly. I finally feel happy. She gives me an energy and drive that I have never had before. It's a legitimately life changing event.

We are getting married next year. We are planning a life together. And I feel like I am living in a fantasy that my younger self romanticized about but never thought possible.

I read a lot of sad stories, breakups, and traumatic tales on this sub. I just wanted to add my piece of joy to this crazy world of love. Everyone has the capacity to love and be loved. It just takes finding that right someone.

Thank you all for listening to this cheesy ramble.

​

**TL;DR Autistic weirdo finally found someone who loves him and who he loves too.**"
66,"I (28f) can’t stop hating my husband (37m).


TLDR: I resent my husband from things he has done, and now every single miscommunication is too much for me. 

I met him 10 years ago and “dated” online for 5, living together for 5. We got married and had a kid. My family and friends live in another country. When I got here (rural community in the US) he wouldn’t let me do anything because he said I’d break his things (as in not let me do the laundry whileI was doing nothing all day). He didn’t help me find a job, didn’t introduce me to his friends because he says he didn’t have any left after we started dating. I probably had a panic attack when I realized I made a huge mistake leaving work, family and friends to be together. 

I adopted a dog so I wouldn’t feel alone. I found a low level job because I was an immigrant and am slowly building my career back. We have a son together, he’s 2.5y. He has a daughter (13y) and she goes to her mom every other weekend. 
He is going through bankruptcy because he used credit cards irresponsibly all his life. I am glad he is finally solving this problem. I paid 99.99% of medical bills for my child’s birth and thusfar, clothes, toys, books and activities. I am usually the one who teaches our son new things. I don’t feel my husband wants to do any of that, (eg: we have someone coming once a month to give us tips about child development and he chooses to not stay in the room when she’s there). 

We have been arguing for years now. This weekend he invited me to go to another town with him but it was during our toddler nap so I couldn’t go. He took his daughter and kept texting me trivial things but failed to mention they were eating out. 
I took the toddler to swim and when we came back my husband saw me preparing dinner and didn’t say anything. When I offered some for him to try his daughter was shocked and asked if he was hungry. That’s how I found out. I feel neglected because I was tired and he could have brought us takeout. 

I resent him from him leaving me by myself at the hospital  overnight when I was pregnant to him taking a single afternoon off after I begged him to stay home multiple times because I had a preemie. I resent him for choosing when he wants to act like a family and when he doesn’t. I know it’s a lot to ask from him because it was my choice to move here. I just resent him. 

We are going to couple’s therapy but honestly I view it as divorce mediation. 

I have pushed him away from a room and touched him aggressively because of all the hatred I feel. I have broken things but I stopped. He’s started breaking things too but nothing in the last couple months. 

He’s offered me to be a stay home mom because he thinks I’m stressed from work. 

Help anyone?"
67,"My (35F) BIL (27M) offered our house to GF (22F) visiting relatives


My husband's brother ""Dan"" is dating a girl (Kate) who we don't like. She's opening a new retail store (she makes handcrafted purses) in our town and has a large family coming to town to cheer her on. Dan called me today to ask if it would be ok for her relatives (10 people) to stay with us since we have a large house and a few empty rooms. I declined because a) we don't like Kate, b) it's just plain awkward since it's not our family and Dan/Kate aren't married either, and c) we have little kids at home. Dan got really upset at me. After asking for more info it turns out he had already volunteered our place since we aren't using the rooms and he doesn't see how it would be an issue. Coincidentally, there's a major convention in town that week, and all the hotel rooms in town are now booked solid, so I'll be the bad guy if I now say no since her relatives are expecting the accommodation and now have no other choices. Maybe they're nice people but they're basically strangers. My husband has also flat out told Dan no, but we feel stuck- what would you do?

tldr
BIL's gf's relatives are in town. BIL offered them our place to stay without asking.

68,"I [24 F] like to get outdoors when I'm stressed or upset. My boyfriend [26 M] thinks it's weird and unhealthy.



When I'm under a lot of stress, I like to go backpacking and camping alone, just for a weekend or something. I started when I was a teenager with a shitty home life, I'd just go camping in my cheap pup tent, or sometimes without a tent at all on nice days. Just go deep into the woods around my family's house out in the country. 

Over time, I got better gear, and now I've got a whole backpacking setup. I keep my gear in my backpack, so whenever I want to go, all I have to do is pack food, clothes, and a map, and I can be out the door in no time. I live in a city now, so I have to drive out to somewhere to camp. Usually a wilderness area in a state or national forest. I always tell my brother my planned route and when I'll be back.

I keep a camping journal that I only write in when I'm out in the woods, it's got a lot of soul searching and deep shit in there, since I generally go on camping trips to have some time to think stuff through. I wrote in it about my abusive family, coming out as bi, going through some scary experiences in college, having a lot of my skewed worldview shattered when I moved out of my small town, etc.

It's super cathartic, spending a couple days just thinking about survival, the little things like gathering firewood and building a fire to cook over, following a map, finding water, etc. Then spending the night somewhere, relaxing in nature with no distractions like a phone, or technology, or other people.

Most of my friends think of it as an odd little quirk of mine. They've all lived in cities or suburbs their whole lives, and think it's a little crazy to go spend a few days in the wilderness. But they think it's harmless, and just joke about me going off to cuddle the wildlife.

----

Anyway, last week, something happened that shook me up, and made me want to go camping. I found out that someone I had thought of as a friend had been beating his kids. I was shaken up by the fact that there was another side to a guy who had seemed so kind and compassionate otherwise. I was also sad to lose a friend, because of course there was no way I could get past that knowledge and remain friends with that guy.

So I told my boyfriend a little bit about it, and told him that I'd be going camping. It wasn't like I was cancelling any plans with him; he was scheduled to work over the weekend anyway. 

He said that he didn't want me to go when I was upset, he didn't like the idea of me alone in the woods for days when I was upset and shaken up. 

I said that going camping was my way to deal with being shaken up, it has a calming effect on me, so while I may still be sad, I'll be in a better place to think things through.

He said that it wasn't a good way to deal with stress, I should be talking to people, and not isolating myself. 

Basically, I'm fine with talking about stuff, but only after straightening it out in my own head first. I'd rather not jump into talking about stuff when I'm too upset.

My boyfriend said he didn't want me to go, but I said that I needed to, and that I'd just be going for one night.

-----

After I got back, he's been really weird about it. Like asking a lot of questions about what I was doing. And why, if I was just going to think, I had to be in the woods. Couldn't I think anywhere? 

I tried to explain it like I did in this post, how I've done this for a long time, how it brought me peace. And he just didn't get it. He thinks it's unhealthy, that I'm running away from problems, etc.

How do I explain to a city boy that the outdoors really does bring me peace?

TLDR - I go camping when I'm stressed or emotional, and my boyfriend doesn't get it. He thinks it's unhealthy.

69,"A guy [20M] has been coming onto my girlfriend [21F] and she's oblivious but seems to like him. I [21M] feel like I'm gonna lose her.


Note: this is a repost, I accidentally deleted the other one that I just made

I've been with my girlfriend for about a year and a half and I love her so fucking much. She's amazing in every way and I'm so lucky to have her. However, I hate to bring the ""league"" stuff in but she is definitely out of my league. We're quite the polar opposites; she's very social and outgoing and I'm socially awkward and introverted.

Our relationship has been a smooth road up until now. About two weeks ago, we started our junior year in college. My girlfriend and I are in completely different majors so we don't have any classes together. After our first day, she told me about ""Ian"", a guy who sits next to her in one of her classes. He's some sophomore that skipped a grade level in that class, which is why he's in class with my girlfriend. She immediately mentioned how smart he is and how she's glad that they sit next to each other. Throughout the next couple of days, I hear bits and pieces about Ian, but nothing that made me suspicious. It was mostly stuff like, ""Ian is really smart, he solved the problem in a minute and it took me like thirty haha.""


​ I decided to do some light stalking and looked up his Facebook and Instagram and shit, the dude is much better looking than me. If we're talking ""leagues"" again, he is definitely in her league. Plus, he's smart.


​ One day, I saw my girlfriend's snapchat story of him and her in class fooling around folding paper airplanes (wtf??). The next day, it was a picture that he drew of her (of course he can draw too). He signed the pic with his name and a heart. The pic is now hung up in my girlfriend's dorm which I'm fine with since it's a great drawing and she likes to tape drawings up (she's into art too). But it still just rubs me the wrong way.


At that point, I was pretty sure he's into her based off of him talking to her in her snapchat stories and stuff she told me. The ultimate confirmation came when he invited her to a party. My girlfriend was hesitant to go since it was majority sophomores and I told her that it would probably be lame (to which she agreed) but then her roommate somehow convinced her to go in the end. At first, my girlfriend kept texting me pictures of her rolling her eyes at the party and kept telling me that it was lame as fuck and that she should've stayed home, etc. She then sent me a pic of her roommate making out with some guy with the caption, ""I've been abandoned."" to which I responded and asked her if she wanted me to come get her. She never responded to that text. About thirty minutes later, her snapchat story is now filled with her doing shit with Ian. There was one where he had his arm around her and she was making faces. Another one of him shirtless holding a physics textbook (???) and then finally one of him dancing with three girls and the caption, ""mr. popular."" She came back around like 1am, called me and apologized for not responding but told me that Ian ""came to her rescue"" and she ended up having a great time. I was pretty pissed tbh and I think she could tell by my tone.


​ The party happened two nights ago. Yesterday, she called me in the morning and asked if something was wrong since she thought I sounded weird when we talked the other night. So I just told her how I felt about her friendship with Ian and how it was making feel a bit insecure. I also made sure to mention, just in case it flew over her head, that he is obviously into her. She apologized for making me that way and reassured me that she loved me with all her heart. She also told me that her and Ian are just friends and that he was definitely not coming onto her. She said that that's just his personality: very touchy, flirtatious, outgoing, and like that with everyone. I really doubt it.


​ It's been another day, and the more I think about it, the more insecure I feel. I feel like I'm losing her and she's only known him for two fucking weeks. They still sit together in class and probably joke and flirt all the time and it just makes me super uncomfortable and jealous.


What should I even do at this point? Maybe I'm overreacting?


TL;DR: Girlfriend met a guy during class that's the polar opposite of me (he's very attractive and outgoing) and she really likes him, but as a friend, and he's definitely into her. I'm worried I'm going to lose her."
70,"My [30/f] fiancé [37/m] and I don’t kiss anymore... this realization is heartbreaking.


I love my fiancé dearly. He is my best friend in the whole world and we always have so much fun together. I am in awe of the man that he is and I am still so attracted to him. But we don’t kiss anymore. Sure, we give a quick, routine peck on the lips when we go our separate ways or at night before bed. But that’s it.

I brought it up to him the other day and he said he just doesn’t know how to kiss me anymore. I don’t know how to kiss him anymore either. We tried and it was... weird. We both were taken back by it. Kissing him used to be the greatest feeling in the whole world. We would kiss for what seemed like hours! A lot of the time it wouldn’t even progress beyond that and it didn’t have to. Passionately kissing him was just so satisfying. 

I don’t know when it changed. It must have been gradually because I never noticed until recently. But it feels like it’s been ages since we passionately kissed. I honestly can’t remember the last time we did. We still have sex on a semi-regular basis (not as much as I would like though), but without kissing. A lot of the time we are facing away from each other. Writing it out makes me so sad. 

I know that he loves me and I love him so much. We have both gotten in really good shape and he is honestly more attractive to me now than he ever was. He says the same about me, and is always making comments about my body and touching me more than usual. 

But why don’t we kiss anymore? Why can’t we kiss anymore? How do we fix this? He is my longest relationship, so I don’t know if this just happens after a certain length of time or what but it makes me very sad. 

Tl;dr- my fiancé of 4 years and I no longer kiss beyond a quick, routine peck on the lips. We tried kissing after realizing we don’t do it anymore, and it was weird. We are best friends and get along so well. I know we are still in love, so why can’t we kiss passionately anymore? How do we fix this?

I'm writing this mostly to get it off my chest and maybe get a second opinion on whether or not I did the right thing because I'm not 100 percent sure myself. Also I'm writing this on mobile so please forgive any spelling mistakes.

Anyway this story actually starts about a year and half ago. I had a decent job at the time, only major issue with it was a stupid long commute time. As luck would have it I discovered that a place near my house was hiring, they paid about the same as my at the time current job so I applied. I got the job, all seemed good so I quit the old job. 

Almost right away there were problems with the new job. First off, management change. I was hired by the old manager right before she retired and the new manger did not follow through on her promises, giving me far less hours then I was told I'd get. I repeatedly asked new manager to give more hours and he always promised them to me, but when I'd get my schedule for the week I'd only have around 15 hours when I was promised 40. I'd ask about them, he'd promise me more hours next week, rinse and repeat.

Then I got fired suddenly. I was never given a reason, just that they apparently didn't need me so they're letting me go. I'd only been working there for a month. This was really bad to me since due to the low hours I was already strapped for cash and I hadn't been working long enough to be eligible for severance so I basically had nothing but the two grand in my savings account. I spent the next two months borrowing money from friends and family and scrambling to find a new job. I eventually did and I actually really love this job, it's a sales job for a specialized store with some great commission so I'm actually making way more money now then before. If you ask me about it now I'd say the whole ordeal was a blessing in disguise since I probably wouldn't have current job had I not gone through that. At the time though? Never in my life had I experienced so much anxiety. It was awful. I had to basically beg for money from whoever I thought would help me and eat at food banks to get by. It was winter at the and I couldn't afford to heat my apartment so I had to wrap up with blankets and jackets to not freeze. I had never struggled so much in my life.

Fast forward to a couple days ago and I've been at my current job for a little more then a year. Old manager (the one who fired me) comes in to make an order. He had no idea I work there, he just walked in because he needed what we sell. I was working alone that day so I helped him. We chatted some and I pretty much put personal history aside for work. I helped him with his order, wished him well and was about to move on when he stopped me and asked to talk. He apologized to me for how he treated me, said he was new managing at the time, was sorry for giving me bad hours and that he regrets firing me. He asked me if I forgive him.

I don't know what came over me. Maybe it was some residual anger I didn't realize I had held on to, but for some reason his apology pissed me off. I gave it to him straight, said he is the direct cause of the worst time of my life, I don't forgive him and never will. He just kinda meekly walked out after that. 

It's been a couple of days and I'm still thinking about it. At the time it felt really good to tell him off, but I also feel like maybe I should have forgiven him? He didn't have to apologize but did anyway, that was pretty big of him. On the other hand I know it's not my duty to forgive him and should only do it if I want to, and I didn't. I still don't, when I think back to how he treated me it still pisses me off. I just don't know how to feel about this whole incident and I'm confused. I just can't shake the feeling that I was there bad guy in this scenario.


TL;DR: old manager who treated me badly came to my store to buy stuff, asked for forgiveness but I told him off. Was I wrong?"
72,"My mother cut my (F15) hair and my father absolutely hates it


Hey so I had a hairstyle that damaged my hair a lot and so my mother said I was old enough to choose a different style. We decided to cut it really short so I had a mini Afro and I like it. When my father saw it he was so upset that he stormed out of the house. He was gone for like an hour and when he came back he said that he was mad we didn’t approve the style with him. 

My mother said I was old enough to make my own decisions and that he was being spoiled. My dad said I looked like a metrosexual and that he kept bugging me when I was going to change it. My father absolutely killed my self esteem and I’ve been crying all day. He didn’t compliment me at all and I’m just so sad cause I thought he would like it. 

Now my father’s words made me hate the style and now he’s just so passive aggressive. I will take a long time to grow it back but now I thinking everytime he looks at me he sees my hair and it puts him in a sour mood. How can I move forward? He apologized but it was very hollow and I can tell he still upset. 

What can I do? I wear jewelry and make up to be more feminine but it’s not cutting it for him.

*** TL;DR **my father hates my haircut and our relationship is hostile because of it."
73,"My guy friend [23M] has a photo of me [21F] on his lock screen. How do I get him to remove it?


I was hanging out with a guy friend and he had to leave to pick up food he ordered. He forgot his phone in the dorm. I heard a phone ring and thought it was my phone, but it turned out to be his. 

I saw his lock screen and found out that he has a photo of him and I on it. A few months ago, We were out at a restaurant and took a group photo outside. He had an arm around my shoulder (as a friend, I have a boyfriend). 

The weird part is that he cropped everyone else out and just has a photo of me and him together.

Should I be worried? He hasn’t asked me out yet (since I have a boyfriend). Am I right to feel creeped out?

TL;DR: guy friend has a photo of us as his iPhone screensaver. How do I tell him to take it down?"
74,"My (F, 28) boyfriend (M, 29) drastically buffed up after my best friend (F, 29), who is also married to one of his best friends, body-shamed him


So this might sound a bit convoluted, but please bear with me for a moment. My boyfriend of five years and me are part of a very tightly-knit – one might say incestuous even – friendship group. He is close to the boyfriends/husbands of some of my dearest friends and we all do a lot of stuff together, e.g. go on long trips or spend the holidays with each other. 

This year, most of the group went to Asia for three weeks – I couldn’t join due to work commitments. After my boyfriend came back, he went on a crazy diet-exercising-combo that lead to him losing nine kilos and really muscling up at the same time: I’m talking going to the gym four times a week, cutting his carbs, and basically living on protein shakes for the past few months. I asked him what the motivation for this change of lifestyle was, as he had been somewhat of a couch potato all through our relationship, but he just gave me noncommittal answers. Eventually, I found out that my best friend had teased him quite a bit about his body during the holiday.

I did find it a bit weird that he would make such a drastic change to his lifestyle and his appearance just because of some joking comments from someone in our friendship group, but thought nothing much of it. In the last weeks I noticed some other peculiar habits though. Not only does he spend way more time on his clothing and his hair when we are going out to meet our friends, but he literally uses every opportunity to take off his shirt in front of her. She also did comment approvingly on his changed appearance and I swear they both blushed.

Am I reading too much into all of this? Is there a non-conspicuous reason for his behaviour or should I be worried that he is interested in her? 

TLDR; My boyfriend lost a lot of weight due to some comments one of my best friends made. Does that mean he is into her? "
75,"(24f) Worried about my serious boyfriend’s (24m) creepy brother (22m)


My boyfriend, B, is very kind and social, we’ve been dating for almost 3 years and have also lived together most of that time.

But he has a slightly younger brother who scares me. He has never spoken to me unless forced to say hello by his mother (he’ll say hello to his brother but not me), has walked in on me while I was changing (butt naked) and said nothing, calls me ‘B’s bitch’ over text even though I’ve never done anything to him except say hello, and he punched my boyfriends first girlfriend in the stomach so hard that she fell over just because he knew her from school and didn’t like her. Recently he has also been encouraging my boyfriend to watch enslavement anime (girls are collared and chained slaves of a man).

I know he has no interest in real girls and will basically never speak to one, but I’m afraid he has some hatred as well because of his reactions to other girls and the slave girl thing. 

Am I wrong to be concerned about this in the long term? I obviously hope to marry my boyfriend and raise kids one day. Does this matter for our relationship at all? We haven’t lived with the brother for a while and never will again.

Tl;dr: boyfriends brother is violent, rude, and likes girl enslavement fantasies. I’m kind of scared of him, does it matter in the long run?"
76,"My friend and housekeeper (68F) asked for a substantial loan. I (31F) said no. Any advice?


My friend was my neighbor first for several years. I always hired maids, I work full-time and cleaning is my least favorite activity in my life.

&amp;#x200B;

It was my first house, so I lived in a really low income area. This meant all my neighbors probably subsisted on like $20-40k a year, and my salary initially when I moved was in that ballpark. Despite having a low salary, this was my one treat--a weekly maid visit, so I could just focus on work.

&amp;#x200B;

One day, while we were having a friendly neighbor talk at the mailbox, she said she used to houseclean when I was talking about my maid service being late, and so we set up an arrangement where twice a week she would do light cleaning. At the time she asked $20/hr, now it's up to $35/hr because I believe in paying fairly so every once in a while I give a small hourly raise--she does a very good job, she's always on time, and I think in the four years she's been doing it she's literally missed maybe two days.

&amp;#x200B;

Since then, we have become friends. We talk about life, and she has done things like invite me to her family Christmas. When I went on a trip, she fed my cats for free (I ended up paying her, but she completely did it without asking for that, she just loves them--I just decided to give her an hour of pay a day for coming down to visit them daily). She says I am more like a kid/grandchild to her, and her entire family is very kind to me. She has a history of adopting ""strays"" (people, not animals) and at the dinner a few other people who were not blood related were there who felt similar toward her, so I don't think she's lying when she says how much I mean.

&amp;#x200B;

The one aspect in her life that I feel sucks is she's naively, and sweetly, a pushover for her sons. One is a heroin addict who is clean now, but spent many years using her and currently is drunk 24/7 so they swapped the dragon for booze. The other is a heroin addict as well, but relapses a lot. They are in their late 40s but literally take every dime she makes for rent, groceries, and more.

&amp;#x200B;

Today she approached me talking about how her kid was expecting a windfall and she showed me some documents. They definitely don't prove the kid is expecting a thing, without being too revealing it's sort of a disability scam, and I think genuinely it will flop--these children of hers are always doing stuff like this. However, she's apparently been paying their rent because she's been expecting them to get back on their feet any day now.

&amp;#x200B;

So she told me, she took out a $3k loan to pay for their rent etc and it's due Sept 1st. Obviously this is a weird timeline--loans from a bank etc wouldn't be like this. 

&amp;#x200B;

She asked me if I could pay it all.

&amp;#x200B;

This is the FIRST time she's ever asked me for money. I felt incredibly uncomfortable and I managed a no, but I am anxious and in general feel so weird like I've let her down since $3k wouldn't be too bad for me to pay (I have zero debt and a nice savings). She handled it graciously, disappointed but she understood. She said she had no one else to ask and just thought maybe it was possible.

&amp;#x200B;

As for why she felt it was possible - over the years, my salary has gone from the original 35k it was to almost 250k. She is aware because I moved to a really nice apartment a year ago, and I also increased her rate when I got the latest new job because I felt it was fair.

&amp;#x200B;

Anyway... how do I go back to normal after this? Asking for $3k seemed like such a big ask, and while she's  been so kind about it, \*I\* feel guilty and \*I\* feel weird she even asked?

&amp;#x200B;

\*TL;DR Friend/housekeeper asked for a $3k loan. I said no, but feel weird now and can't help but anxiously question the nature of our friendship. How do I move past it? I also feel bad for her because she is in debt because of her drug addicted sons.\*

77,"My boyfriend [22M] only tries to have sex with me [25F] at night. I'm starting to feel like an object and resent him.


We've been together for three years. I am the only person he's ever been with. We haven't had regular sex for a couple of months and when we do, it's incredibly boring and routine. I'm starting to not feel attracted to him or turned on at all.

I've brought this up a number of times and begged him to try new things. I'm very open minded and love to experiment. I've purchased toys for both of us to use, described to him what turns me on, and asked him to watch porn of couples to discover new ideas. I've taken kink questionnaires and sent him the results. Despite trying to teach him the basics of foreplay, he continues to only initiate sex at the same time, in the same place, and in the same position where I'm on the my side and he's entering from behind. He'll only last for a few seconds and it doesn't feel intimate in the slightest.

Last night, around an hour after we had both went to bed, he asked me if I was still awake. He told me that he couldn't sleep, so he reached over, squirted lube on his fingers, and inserted them inside me. I freaked out and told him I didn't want to have sex, then left the room to calm down. His response to me was that he REALLY needed to have sex. I brought up how he's still trying to do the same things, how he didn't talk to or kiss me at all, and that I don't want to be used when he feels the need to get off. I told him I was disgusted by him and slept on the couch.

I'm struggling to know what to do next. I've read that people suggest giving in and having sex even when you don't want to because it'll feel good once you get into it. I've done that a few times and it makes me feel empty. Same with initiating on my own. I miss being passionate and turned on.

Even if he tries to make an effort now to try new things with me, I can't stop thinking about how bad our sex has gotten. It used to be amazing and the best I had ever experienced. He's very attractive, tall, and works out often. He should be someone who could easily turn me on from looks alone, but it's like he completely gave up trying. I'm not sure how to move past this and see him as a partner again.

Is breaking up my only option? Has anyone recovered from a similar situation?

tldr; Boyfriend is sexually inexperienced and stopped putting in effort to meet my needs during sex. He only initiates at night, in bed, and from behind without foreplay. Last night he tried to force sex with me when I was asleep and I felt violated. Is it possible to repair our lack of passion?"
78,"My boyfriend (20M) yelled at me (19F) for speaking too quietly when I had a migraine


I had a migraine so bad I could barely speak, vision was blurry, dizzy, nauseous, distorted vision. 
I got home and my boyfriend asked how work was. Explained how my day went and that I had to leave early because of how bad my head was. We didn’t speak much further, until I kissed him when I was about to leave the room. He said I love you to which I responded. He then goes, “BABE!” (which only hurt my head further) to which I ask, “what?”
“Say it audibly, Jesus. It’s not that hard.” 
We exchange a few more words, and I explained that I’m trying to speak softly to prevent hurting my head more. I also asked that if he had heard it, which obviously he did because it prompted the whole conversation, then what was the problem. 
He said, “do you not understand how bad it hurts me when you say it under your breath so softly I can barely hear it?” 
“I’m sorry that my head hurts bad enough that I can barely speak.”
“It doesn’t fucking matter that your head hurts.”

After this I walked away, because I truly couldn’t believe he just said that to me. 

Am I rightfully upset? Was this completely out of line? I feel like that showed that he blatantly doesn’t care about my feelings and how I physically feel. Or mentally for that matter. We have had (a lot of) problems in the past that were honestly breakup-worthy that I blew off. I feel like this crosses the line. Am I out of hand here?

TL;DR: boyfriend got mad about me speaking quietly due to migraine and said that it “doesn’t fucking matter” that my head hurts. Am I incorrect or was that a really shitty thing to do?"
79,"My (40M) wife (39F) lied and said that my cousin (33M) was being a creep to her at a bar. Completely unsure why she would lie about this. My cousin was 1,000 miles away when this supposedly happened.


My wife burst out crying when we were watching television, and said that she was at a bar with her girlfriends and my cousin was at the bar and ran into them. They had met once before, my cousin is from europe so he is rarely here, but hes been in town for the past month. 

My wife said that he was being really creepy and flirty and apparently grabbed her ass at the bar and asked her to have sex. She stormed out. Obviously I was furious... but also weirded out. My cousin is gay. I never told her that, she has no idea. I have about 15 cousins so he is just another cousin in a long line of cousins she rarely meets. 

Regardless, I was furious. I called my cousin and asked him what the fuck he was doing grabbing my wifes ass and all this stuff and he just sounded confused. He just told me ""one second, I have to text you something"" and hung up, then sent me an uber car receipt. From Miami. We're in new jersey. The receipt he showed me was the exact day and time that this supposedly happened, saturday night. He also showed me a picture of him, in miami. He told me to check his facebook, when I did, voila, I found pictures uploaded of him in Miami. 

Needless to say I was confused and honestly a bit hurt. 

I confronted my wife and just asked her why she would say something like that, and she insisted she wasn't lying. Then I showed her the texts and she just suddenly went very quiet. 

We've been married since we were in our early 20s. We have 3 kids. I cannot think of any reason why she would lie about this, why she would say such things, this is SO SO out of character for her. 

Its been THREE WHOLE DAYS since that, and she still refused to tell me why she lied, instead she acts like the incident never happened and whenever I bring it up she says she doesn't want to talk about it, and then yesterday she STILL INSISTED it happened, but went quiet when I told her that was impossible. She looks really guilty, its just painfully obvious that she has lied about this. 

I mentioned that we should go to couples therapy over this. Our relationship has been good... pretty much forever, but specifically over this I told her I want a professional to speak to her. She refused, and said it wasn't a big deal, but she was red in the face of embarrassment. She looks embarrassed every time I bring it up. 

Here is my other dilemma. Her tears, and her crying when she brought it up? Those seemed real. She also never lies, and when she has (usually small things) its painfully obvious when she is lying. But I know she did lie. I just need to find out what the source of that was. I've had countless sit downs with her where I am calm and tell her I won't be mad and ask her why she did that, and what caused that. She just looks at me blankly. One time she even laughed and said ""I was making a big fuss over nothing"" but I could tell even she felt bad about it. 

What am I supposed to do?

TL;DR - - Wife of 18 years lied and said my cousin was acting creepy to her. I called her out on it, and she refuses to admit she was lying, and acts like it wasn't a big deal. "
80,"My birth parents (30sM/F) recently attempted to get back in contact with me (16F)


(Throwaway because I don't have a reddit account, apologies for formatting due to mobile)

To start out with, the players in this story are me, my adoptive dad, and my birth parents.

My parents terminated their parental rights when I was 10. Without going into too much detail, I was assaulted by some members of my family, and I ended up with post-traumatic amnesia (I literally didn't remember anything about myself or the world around me. Look it up, if you want) and severely decreased use of my right leg (I now walk with a cane). My parents terminated their rights to me while I was in a coma after the assault.

After my stay in the hospital, I was put into foster care. I recovered the majority of my memories (my name, my family, my home address, etc.) in the first few weeks, and I was horribly depressed due to the fact that I couldn't see my family.

My adoptive father adopted me out of the system when I was eleven, after he had fostered me for several months. He is probably the nicest person I know, and he has accepted every part of me with love and warmth. In every way except biologically, he is my father.

However, about two-ish months back, my birth parents showed up at our door. I don't even know how they got the address, since they terminated their rights to me???

Anyways, they showed up at the door at eight o'clock at night, claiming to be my dad's friends (who actually were meant to be there to do some gaming marathon with my dad). When I opened the door for them, they tackled me in a group hug, which was INCREDIBLY uncomfortable. I barely recognized these people, and they just hugged me!

I shouted, since I was so freaked out, and my dad ran down and physically pushed them off of me. Once they explained who they were, he sent them away and told them to come back the next day. When they did, they said that they hadn't terminated their rights to me, that it was done against their will, and that they wanted me back in their lives. They've been staying at a nearby motel for the past two months.

The problem is, I don't WANT to be in their lives. I have a life with my dad and my (adoptive, obviously) aunts and uncles and my friends. I'm an entirely different person than I was before the assault, and I don't want to be put back with the family that let me get hurt so badly in the first place. But they're threatening to charge my dad with kidnapping or something if I don't go with them.

Inb4 ""this is so fake, ugh this sounds like a bad soap opera, who could believe something so obviously fake"": yeah, I fucking wish this was a bad soap opera.

81,"Me [21F] with my boyfriend [20M], the girl he was very much interested in that broke his heart left her boyfriend and has now shown active interest in mine. Boyfriend says he hates her, yet I still feel threatened. What can I do to feel different?


Hey guys, I’m part of a large friend group that spans across at least 20 people. This girl named “Karen” is a very beautiful and well liked girl by everyone. She is super tiny, has great curves and also a great personality. I’ve never personally disliked her. I met my boyfriend through this friend group and we started dating in April. Prior to getting beyond friendship, he was seeing Karen for a few weeks and she lead him on until a better guy came along and dumped him. My boyfriend was very distraught and annoyed by this and stopped talking/acknowledging her altogether. 

We all went out last night and when she was there she stood right next to my boyfriend pretty much the whole night and it really bummed me out. I could see that he was a bit bummed out too. She told me that she had broken up with her boyfriend and claimed “she just didn’t want to hurt anyone” so it was “mutual”. 

The night went on and this morning I woke up and saw that she had sent him a very long message saying how sorry she was for hurting my boyfriend, that she is very happy for him and me but misses him etc and hopes they can “get closer”. I was super upset at this but didn’t want to cause trouble so I didn’t say anything. His reaction to it was reassuring as he said he was no way interested, but I’m still worried that he might end up leaving me for her. She is a relentless person and doesn’t give up if she wants a guy, she’s always the type to get any guy she goes after while I am not. I don’t think I’m ugly by any means but she’s definitely more my boyfriends type than I am. 

I’m sorry if this doesn’t make any sense, I just feel a bit threatened by her suddenly showing interest and being single. I don’t see my friends very often and she typically does. The scenario has really dampened my mood and I don’t want to act like a jealous girlfriend. 

Tl;dr - boyfriends previous flame has been clingy since breaking up with her boyfriend, feeling extremely threatened and don’t know how to navigate. "
82,"My (21/F) Coworker(40s/F) came into my class and confronted me because it ran over and I was later for work. [Update]


Hey guys,

[previous question](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/7rb5jo/my_21f_coworker40sf_came_into_my_class_and/)

Its been a while since I posted, but I got some really great news and thought it'd be nice to update all of you that helped me get through the awful few months I had to deal with Tammy. To update those that didn't see the original, my co-worker came barging into my class and caused a big disruption when it went over, really embarrassing me in the process. I wasn't sure exactly what to do, so I came to you guys for help.


So I eventually did email my boss about it and she just defended Tammy's actions as her ""caring a lot about the students"". I just rolled my eyes and came to the conclusion that Tammy's bullshit was going to be something I had to put up with for the rest of the semester. 


I certainly learned a lot doing that. I knew if I gave her anything to go off of it would come back and bite me in the butt eventually, so I spent the rest of the year keeping to myself and just doing my job. I got pretty good at humouring her and stroking her ego when ever she would talk to me about what was going on in her life. Near the end of the semester, she had applied for a job outside of the school and I really encouraged her to take it if she got it.


By the time finals came around she'd interviewed for it and things were looking really good. She was going to suggest to my boss that I take over the library full time during the summer if she did get it, but by the time classes ended and my contract was up I'd heard nothing about that so i found a summer student job I really enjoy and I've been doing that since. I did get an email from my boss asking me what I was doing for the summer later on, but I'd already started the job at that point.


I saw the student library job posted last week and put in an application for it, my old boss called me the next day to schedule an interview with the New library tech at my campus. Apparently Tammy did end up getting the job, moved off to another city, and we finally have someone that's properly trained running our library!!!!!


I get to spend this year actually working under someone that knows what they're doing and I don't have to worry about all of Tammy's drama. Its going to be a great year!


Thank you guys so much for all the advice and for giving me a place to vent. I appreciate it so much! And thank you to everyone that messaged me about library tech jobs and such! I really like working in a library and research, but after a summer working in archives I've realized that I'm much more interested in the idea of working towards a brighter future, rather than examining the past, so I'm applying to law school this year!

**tl;dr: I made it through the semester, Tammy left over the summer, and, now, I get to spend the entire year working under someone that actually knows what they're doing!!!**"
