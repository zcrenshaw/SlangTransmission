0,"UPDATE: recently found out that I (17M) got into my brother's (19M) former dream university which he did not get accepted to last year, feeling guilty about really wanting to go now


Update to my [previous post](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/95s4ri/recently_found_out_that_i_17m_got_into_my/)

On Saturday I was able to speak to my brother and tell him that I got into the university. He was really happy for me, like a lot of people said he would be. When I told him I got in he gave me a huge hug and was really excited. It was such a huge relief. 

He asked me if it was my top choice, since he didn't know I had applied. I told him it was and he said that we have to celebrate then. He told me I didnt seem excited enough and I should be really proud of myself, and he asked if it was the shock of just finding out. 

When I told him I find out a few days ago and he was the only one that knew he asked me whats going on, because I wasnt reacting to the great news like it was great news. I admitted that I worried about telling him because I didnt want him to be mad. 

We talked about it and he basically said what everyone in the comments said, that he's proud of me and happy for me. I mentioned that I got into a different program than his and my requirements were lower, and he told me to not downplay my success and to stop worrying about him being mad because he wasn't. He told me that when I told out parents he wanted me to be more confident and proud of myself, because I did something great. 

 Yesterday while we were hanging out at his buddy's house he told me I should tell them the news, when I didnt want to because I hate talking about myself he asked if could tell them, which I told him was OK. they were all happy for me too. Honestly, he's reaction was better than I even hoped for, but looking back I should have expected it from him because that's always been the type of brother he is.

TL;DR told my brother I got into the university and he incredibly supportive and happy for me. He told me not limit my success to make other people more comfortable, and that he was proud of me (which meant a lot to hear)."
1,"UPDATE: My [22 M] girlfriend [23 F] refuses to learn to drive and I'm sick of being her personal chauffeur every day.


My [original post](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/7c3u10/my_22_m_girlfriend_23_f_refuses_to_learn_to_drive/) didn't get much attention, but I still feel inclined to share good news. Nine months ago, I used Reddit to find out how to encourage my girlfriend to learn to drive due to being in a car accident that gave her PTSD. I gave her an ultimatum to learn to drive and get rides from me, or don't learn to drive and find her own way to get to where she needs to go. She picked option one. She got a permit, and saved up for driving lessons. After the first one, she realized how easy it was and FINALLY GOT HER LICENSE (and made zero mistakes on the driving test with absolute confidence)!  She doesn't get flashbacks behind the wheel, drives without any sense of nervousness, and thanks me for helping her out. She's now saving up for her car and we took a road trip to celebrate. Thank you all!

tl;dr Girlfriend saw how it affected me, made an opportunity out of learning to drive and got her license so we could take an epic road trip. All is well."
2,"[UPDATE] Am I (30f) overreacting to my husband’s (34m) words?


Original post:  https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/5r6a2g/am_i_30f_overreacting_to_my_husbands_34m_words/?st=JKLZ5SJH&amp;sh=61d0d355

I just wanted to come back and update and say, all of you were right. I should have left that night. Not too long after posting that, the emotional abuse finally turned physical. I was held hostage in my home for over an hour while I was assaulted, demeaned, and scared for my life. I left that night. 

It was a hard road. I’ve questioned myself, my sanity, and sometimes even whether I did the right thing. Emotional abuse took a huge toll on my psyche and self-worth. 

I am happy to say, though, that life has drastically improved for the better. I bought a new home for my kids and I. We’ve got a sweet dog and two precious kitties. My son just started 2nd grade and really enjoyed his first day. Everything is falling into place. I feel horrible for what I put them through, and I know there will probably be rough patches ahead, but we are infinitely better off than where we were. 

If you read my original post and it resonates for you, please take the advice of the commenters. Get. Out. Leave. No one deserves that sort of treatment, and it’s only going to get worse. 

TLDR; emotional abuse turned physical as many commenters feared, and I feel lucky to be alive. Emotional abuse is not a joke. But we’re all doing well now, and life is looking up :)"
3,"[UPDATE] My [28/F] friend [41/F] announced she is getting married next week. I have reason to believe she is lying.


Link to original post: [https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/92ssov/my\_28f\_friend\_41f\_announced\_she\_is\_getting/](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/92ssov/my_28f_friend_41f_announced_she_is_getting/)

So after reading all the responses here, I became increasingly more concerned. A background piece not included in my original post is that all the players in this scenario are connected by a recovery community. Because of this connection, I knew the ""ex"", Ashley, some years ago and we were still on one another's social media. I decided to reach out and ask about James.

That evening Ashley called me and we then conferenced in James. As it turns out, he is married to another woman and they have a child. He and Ashley never dated and aren't even really friends, they simply used to chat at a large meeting that was also attended by my friend, Wendy. They believe that she saw them speaking there and created a delusion that they had dated and Ashley was now poisoning James against Wendy, all the while he was married to another woman. 

Over the course of the last two years, Wendy has approached James at multiple meetings with declarations of love. He reiterated to her each time that he was married and stopped attending that meeting to avoid her. But oddly, she ended up at his meetings again and again. She approached his sponsor and friends telling them they were in love. She also approached Ashley threatening her with a restraining order because she believed Ashley was conspiring against James and her, as a couple, because they were ""together"" now. The second time she approached her, six months ago, Ashley called the police and made a report. 

Until our conference call, Ashley and James didn't realize how they were connected and they didn't know the extent of the delusions. When I told them about the marriage date, they were very concerned. James called the police.

I called the emergency mental health line looking for help, but their only suggestion was to call the police and ask for a welfare check on Wendy, which I did. Knowing that she has no connection to James and is living in a complete delusion made me so concerned for her. Once the wedding date came and she didn't get married, what would happen? How would she mentally process that? 

I was given a reference number and when I called back, was told they made contact but did not intake her since she didn't appear dangerous. Since the check, she has ignored my calls. The wedding date came and passed and I heard nothing. At this time I feel like I lost a friend, but she was already gone in these delusions and I did what I could to help. 

Going forward, I hope to get updates from other people in the community that she is doing better, and hopefully abandons these delusions.

TL;DR: There was no wedding or relationship, James is a real person with no connection to Wendy, she was fully delusional. "
4,"UPDATE [NSFW] My (25f) boyfriend (27m) won't have sex with me unless I orgasm first.


Original post [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/8zvwwb/nsfw_my_25f_boyfriend_27m_wont_have_sex_with_me/?context=10).

I wanted to make an update post since my original got so many responses. I want to say thanks to everyone who gave advice and thanks to those who shared their experiences with the same problem whilst on SSRIs; those comments in particular gave me hope that I'm not doomed to a life without orgasms (lol).

So, the update itself: my boyfriend was actually the person to raise the issue before I had a chance to. While we were cuddling after sex one night, he asked if there was anything at all he could do to help me come. I explained to him basically everything that I'd written in my original post: that I was struggling to get there at all, even by myself, and that I was feeling a lot of pressure from him and would rather just enjoy sex for what it is right now.

He was very apologetic about making me feel pressured. He said that he was trying to be encouraging but he now realized it probably came across as being pushy, and that from now on he'd leave it to me to let him know if I wanted to jump straight to the ""main event"" after foreplay or if I wanted him to try to make me come, if it felt like I might be able to.

After I vented about how frustrating it was to not be able to orgasm any more, my boyfriend encouraged me to buy a decent vibrator (the one I have is pretty basic, and quite old) so that I could try to get there on my own with no pressure at all. We looked online together and ordered one which looked good (browsing vibes together was a weird but fun experience!). It hasn't arrived yet but I'm excited to try it out, and we both agreed that if it works for me then we could try using it during sex too.

Sex has been much less stressful for me since we talked, which I'm really relieved about.

My boyfriend has reiterated that he's happy to do whatever I need to make me orgasm, and he'll leave it up to me to let him know when I want to try rather than him bringing it up all the time. I'm glad that he's been so understanding and considerate and that this hasn't hurt our relationship (or his confidence) at all.

**TL;DR - had a talk about boyfriend's pressure on me to come. He apologized, has taken the pressure off, and we're working out ways to get me there without any pressure.**"
5,"My (26/M) friend (32/M) constantly shouts at his girlfriend (27/F) of a year in front of all of us, so I stood up to him one day and I’ve since had many of our friends tell me that I should have just stayed out of it.


It was two nights ago. He was shouting at her for not putting enough money into the parking meter. They originally did it for two hours but ended up staying at the pub longer, so he asked his girlfriend to put more money into the meter, for another hour. She wasn’t drinking that night, so they took her car and she was the one who was driving. He gave her money to do it, and I guess she ended up forgetting because she said she was going to use the bathroom first and it slipped her mind after that. 

By the time she remembered, she ran out to find that her car was still there. It was okay. She took care of it. She came back and laughingly told us that she forgot for a few minutes there. We laughed with her. No one really thought anything of it, but her boyfriend ended up getting really angry, told her that she was stupid, irresponsible, etc., and that if her car was taken away she’d have had only herself to blame. He was talking to her like an angry parent. It was really weird. From what I’ve noticed, she’s a smart, thoughtful person. I could see maybe getting frustrated with your SO if they behave irresponsibly on a regular basis, but the parking meter was a genuine mistake on her part. She got really embarrassed, didn’t say anything for a few minutes, and then accidentally spilled some water on herself as she was getting up. 

Again her boyfriend just shouted at her in front of us. I normally stay out of it, not because I approve of that sort of behaviour, but because it’s not my relationship and I don’t know the full story. Also I haven’t hung out with them together all that much. Maybe three times before this. Usually it’s just him. But that night I saw it all, and I kept looking around at everyone else to see if they were going to say anything. One of the girls kept saying, “It was a mistake. Relax,” but he kept at it, so I finally stepped in, pulled him aside and told him that he had to stop. I don’t remember my exact words, but it was something along the lines of, “You’re taking it too far. It was a mistake. You can’t talk to people like that. You’re embarrassing her, yourself and everyone at that table.” 

He looked at me as though I was speaking a different language but he calmed down after that, so I figured he got the point. I didn’t think anything of it the rest of the night.

The next day I had a couple of friends telling me that I should have just stayed out of it and that his girlfriend is a grown adult who can handle her own shit. I agree with the second part, but the thing is she wasn’t really handling it all that well in that one situation. And it’s not so much about being a grown adult. There are lots of adults out there who don’t know how to react when someone, particularly their SO, is shouting at them in front of people over nothing. That doesn’t make them any less of an adult. 

She wasn’t standing up for herself and her boyfriend was making the rest of us increasingly uncomfortable with his shit, so I did what I thought was right. I don’t see how that’s a bad thing. It wasn’t really even about her. It was him. Someone had to say something or he would have gone on thinking his behaviour was okay. If he thinks he can talk to another adult like they’re a child, surely he can take it himself. I guess he can’t. I guess he went ahead and told people that I said more than I actually did. I told my friends what I said, and they said they believe me, but they still think I should have stayed out of it. 

I don’t know. 

To be fair I’ve never seen this guy act this way around any of his exes. He’s normally really nice and patient with them, but with the girlfriend he has now, it’s a different story. I don’t know why and I’m not going to pretend like I know, but that’s still no excuse to shout. To me it looks like a lack of respect. 

Anyway I don’t know what to do. I really didn’t mean to create problems in the group. At the time I thought I was helping him, giving him a heads up that he had taken it a little far. But he seems to think I should have stayed out of it. Maybe I should have. I don’t know. 

Should I apologize? Try figuring out what’s going on with him? Or should I leave it alone? 

**tl;dr** He was never like this with any of his exes. Even so he was making everyone uncomfortable, so I pulled him aside and told him that he had taken it too far. It’s been a couple of days now and the few friends I’ve spoken to are saying that I should have stayed out of it. Maybe he’s going through some other shit. I don’t know. Should I apologize, figure out what’s going on, or should I leave it alone and just give it time?"
6,"Husband (M39) asked my (F38) permission to have an affair and I don't know how to react


Last week my husband asked if he could talk about something serious. I said yes, of course, we are always very open and honest with each other. He tells me that he has been very distracted lately looking at other women and he hopes it hasn't bothered me too much. I have noticed him staring at younger women lately which isn't normal for him but I figured there is no harm in looking. It's not a problem for me if he isn't obvious about it and I tell him so. He asks me to tell him if I notice it again so he can stop. I say that's not my job and tell him he can stop on his own. We keep talking until he blurts out that he is thinking a lot about what it might be like to have sex with someone else. 

He knows I had several partners in high school and college. He spent all that time hanging with friends and playing video games. I was his first kiss. Nearly a year later we had sex. I was his first. We've been monogamous and faithful ever since. He promised that was fine with that when we committed. He promised again when we got married. Now nearly 15 years later he isn't fine any more.

He says he'd like to date and have a fling. No way. How is that fair to me or her. He offers to have a one night stand or hire an escort if it makes me more comfortable. How the fuck is that more comfortable. I know that if he does this it won't stop after one person. I can't do an open marriage. I've been cheated on before I met him. I know how it feels. He doesn't have a clue. I'm crying constantly and I keep thinking this has to end in divorce. He offers a legal separation and says we can reconnect in a few months. It doesn't work like that. I say no. I ask if he really wants to divorce over this. He says he doesn't. He does not have to have this he just really wants it. He promises he will get therapy and learn to accept he is a one woman man until he dies. I'm crushed when he says this. I feel so petty. He assures me he can be fine again and asks me to just not worry about it. He tries to joke about really wanting a yacht but he will be fine without one as well. I try to laugh for him.

It's been a week. I'm still crying whenever I'm alone. I can't think about anything else. I can't sleep next to him. I lay awake until he falls asleep and sneak into the guest room. He hasn't mentioned it.

I don't know what to do other than file for a divorce that neither of us wants.

TL;DR: Husband has never slept with or even kissed anyone except for me. He wants my blessing to fuck another woman before he turns 40. I'm angry, sad, confused. I love him to death but I think I need a divorce if he can't be faithful."
7,"(Update) How can I(21F) stop being awkward around my brother(32M)?


[the original post](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/8we9x1/how_can_i21f_stop_being_awkward_around_my/?st=JKNWVG0Q&amp;sh=15aef4f8)

Hey guys, sorry for taking so long to update, I didn’t speak with him at that dinner bc there were a lot of people and I didn’t felt confortable.

Unfortunaly things with my family escalated as this kind of things do. I’m fine as I already have some experience with them going crazy lol. My poor brother, on the other hand, was completely blindsided but we talked and I helped him set up some security devices/tips to avoid our parents.

This did made things take a weird twist and now the whole family is convinced I somehow turned my brother gay(which, ignoring the glaring HOW, is the why I’d do this) and I’m the bad influence. Nothing like waking up to your mom blowing your phone saying you’re going to hell eh?

My brother is pretty shocked and confused. This, at least, gave me the opportunity(after a couple of beers) to talk with him about our family, how I was treated and so. He was pretty heart broken and feeling guilty but I did my best to show him it wasn’t his fault.

I think this conversation really made us closer and made me feel more at ease with the situation. A week or so later he asked if I was alright(I tend to freeze when I’m awkward) and I explained I was a bit intimidated by awesome-ness(not like this lol). He was actually very understanding and said he knew exactly how I felt. Then he started talking a bit about his fuck ups and how he screwed things up.

This helped a lot to take him off the pedestal I had put him in. Right now our relationship is great, I regularly have dinner with them, they met my friends and we’re both supportive of each other situation with our family. I don’t think he’s going to return contact with them, at least until they truly apologize, stop blaming me and accept his husband.

Overall, I’m still not sure of what the future holds, I’m still awkward and kinda flopping around life trying to do things but I’m not so insecure and now I know I have my brother to help me out.

Thanks for all the advices guys!

TL;DR: my family got even crazier but at least this made my brother and I closer. I talked about how I was a bit intimidated and he was great. Life is still hard but things are better now"
8,"Parents [60M, 51F] think me [27M] supporting my sister [19F] through college is ""enabling."" How do I keep the peace?


I'm fortunate enough to be a very high earner and make very good money. So when my sister was thinking about how she'll pay for college, I offered her a deal, as long as she gets excellent grades and gets summer internships, I'll pay for her tuition and living expenses. The money spent here isn't a significant amount for me but I think it's a good investment in my sister's life to make sure she develops a good work ethic and sets herself up for a successful career. I plan to offer the same deal to my younger brother when his time comes, he is 16 right now.

Parents believe this offer should only stand if she studies something they consider useful (unsurprisingly their list of useful majors is very thin and doesn't even include mathematics.) They also want me to include a ""lifestyle"" condition there, since they're worried she's going to do things they disapprove of in college (duh). They believe this ""unconditional"" support means I'm enabling her to make mistakes.

I don't share these opinions and I don't plan on controlling what my sister studies. She should go after her own passions and I'll have her back as long as she's taking it seriously and is being successful. Whether it's aerospace engineering or Greek classics, that's up to her (but I know it will probably be computer science, something our parents disapprove of because they're convinced a kid 14-year-old in a basement can learn it better than you do, ridiculous). They've made it clear that going against their wishes here means they'll want to make sure I won't be able to ""influence"" my brother the way I've done my sister.

But I need to keep the peace because I be around for my little brother too, as he needs me since I'm sure our parents aren't being good influences on him. I just need to keep the parents happy.

Any suggestions on what to do/say to keep them happy while I do what I do and be able to be around for my brother too? 

  ---   
  **tl;dr**: I plan on supporting my siblings (sister now, brother in 3 years) through college and need to be around for them but parents disapprove of how I want to support them and are making it clear that going agains their wishes means reduced access to my little brother. I need a way to keep them happy while doing what I plan on doing."
9,"A coworker [18f] I've known for years wants to be in a relationship with me [27m]. This is wrong, right? [UPDATE]


[link to original post](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/7df3b5/a_coworker_18f_ive_known_for_years_wants_to_be_in/)

A lot has happened since this post. It didn't get much attention, but the advice I got was golden. I'd like to say the first thing I did was follow it and tell my uncle about what had happened, but I was still pretty nervous about how he'd react, so for a few days I just kept my head down and pretended everything was normal. I guess it was, for the most part, but at the time it felt like I was in an episode of the Twilight Zone and I had this awful 'impending doom' feeling in the pit of my stomach. It was a pretty extreme reaction, but I don't get much excitement in my life.

I called off work for two days and took a long weekend to hide out at my house. ""Lily"" brought me get-well soup that Saturday, and my uncle showed up while we were eating it on the couch. She bailed pretty quickly and then it was me and him, and he was giving me this *look* so I kind of blurted out what had happened. We talked about what I was going to do about it, with him refusing to give any worthwhile advice at all - which is not like him. Eventually I said that Lily could finish the rest of the treehouse without me and that I'd tell her I wasn't interested. Uncle says, ""Okay, you do that."" So on Monday before work, I pulled her aside and said it was all just a little too much for me, and could we go back to being co workers? Lily said that was fine.

End of story, right? Except, Lily continued to show up unannounced at my house. I am an idiot, so I continued to let her in. This was much worse than the treehouse business, but she wasn't trying to kiss me or talking about our feelings, so I figured... what's the harm? (Yes, I am an idiot.) And *that* went on for a couple of months. Lily mentions she's going to do community college for a while, first, even though she was all set up to go to a nice school upstate. I hate to admit it, but I was kind of relieved. We started making a real nice footlocker in our free time.

I asked her if she was staying in town for me. She started crying and said she didn't want me to move on without her. Which is crazy, because I've been doing the same thing since I was eight and she's the one that's going places. We got around to the talking about our feelings thing. It took a few days of false starts and clamming up, but the eventual conclusion was: 1) Yes, I definitely needed therapy. 2) She was going to go to her fancy school. 3) We are going to be pen pals when she does.

I held up on my end of the bargain. Therapy is kind of awful, but it helps me work through things. I have a habit of just not thinking about things if they make me uncomfortable. Therapy makes it harder to do that, so mixed blessings, I guess. We talk about Lily, sometimes. More often we talk about my uncle and my childhood, and my parents even though I barely remember them. I discovered I'm really grateful to my uncle, which I knew already, but telling someone else about everything he's done for me really made it hit home. I felt awful about keeping him out of the loop, so I sat him down and told him I hadn't really stopped seeing Lily, but nothing else had happened and I hoped he'd forgive me.

The bastard had been trying to set us up. Gave this whole speech about how we were perfect for each other and how I needed to get my head out of my ass and he wanted me to settle down and be happy already. It made me pretty angry - therapy had also dredged up a bunch of bitterness over how he was always pushing me outside my comfort zone and into things I didn't really want. Dates, mostly. But things like Boy Scouts when I was a kid, and drama class in high school. We rowed about that, but I think he's never going to get that I don't enjoy being social the way he does. Being a fun, amiable guy is just part of who he is, just like being a mean, asocial troglodyte is part of who I am. But that's kind of off topic.

One thing he said really stuck with me. I'd said something about how I was worried it would reflect poorly on him, and he said that he'd built up his shining reputation for both of us, and what was the point of having 'good \[social\] credit' if you couldn't cash it in from time to time? Which makes sense, I guess, because my uncle was kind of an unrepentant ladies' man before he was married, and they still let him into church on Sundays even in those days. Anyway, he said that if I wanted to go for it, he'd make sure people would see it the right way. He's good at swaying people, I guess. I don't know if he's *that* good, but knowing he'd have my back about it made me feel a lot better.

Lily had also decided to tell *her* parents. They were in cahoots with my uncle, although I don't think he pitched it to them the same way he explained it to me, because I can't see ""my nephew needs to get laid already"" going over well with them. They *were* in on the part of the plan that saw us married by the end of the year, though. Lily was not in on any of it.

Things were weird for a while after that. She was mad at her parents (they had been hoping she'd give up on her dreams of being an engineer and going off to school if she got married) and I was working on another project, so we didn't end up seeing each other for a few weeks. Then she shows up and says we should go on a trip, so obviously, we went on a trip. Saw the Grand Canyon and stopped by Las Vegas, and then we spent a few days camping near Zion National Park.

I love the hell out of this girl. I'm going to miss her like crazy when she goes off to school, but I think it's for the best. I don't know how to be with someone, and I'm not sure she's clear on that, either. For now, I'm working on not being a robot who does whatever his uncle says he should do. As much as I love the man, this whole situation has made me realize that I've spent my whole life doing whatever he wants me to do, or whatever I *think* he wants me to do if he won't say it outright. Some of it is probably his fault, but I think mostly it's a glitch in my own head. Gotta start thinking for myself and all that.

tl;dr: Lily and I still hang out. Uncle wants us to get married. I'm seeing a therapist, now. Still no second kiss."
10,"[UPDATE] My boyfriend [19M] got the job instead of me [19F]. He's unintentionally rubbing it in my face but won't stop


[Link to original post](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/95ose5/my_boyfriend_19m_got_the_job_instead_of_me_19f/)

A massive thanks to everyone who gave me advice and also opened my eyes to how big of a douche my boyfriend was doing. Special thanks to those who eloquently put what I've been wanting to say for the past few months into words for me so I could say it to him. 

A day after I made the post, we were hanging out in his dorm when he began talking about his work. He wasn't necessarily bragging this time, it was more like talking about some projects that they're having him do. After a pause in the conversation, I decided to bring up my feelings about him rubbing his job in my face and constantly comparing our positions. I said something along the lines of, 

""I'm really really happy for your job and I can tell that you really love it and have a great time there. I'm not sure if you remember, but I was actually really disappointed that I didn't get that job but I've been trying to move on from my disappointment. However, I feel that you are making it harder for me to move on by constantly comparing our two positions. Sometimes, it seems like you're trying to rub the benefits of your job in my face. (I then listed a couple of examples). I've been feeling a hurt over this and I would really love it if you could stop comparing our positions—because that's very inconsiderate—and maybe instead we can both share a bit about our day at work without turning it into a contest."" 

After saying that, my boyfriend squinted at me and said, ""Are you serious?"" He then proceeded to tell me that I was, some of you guys called it, being ""way too sensitive"". He also asked, ""Why can't I be happy about my job?"" and ""Do you just want me to never talk about anything that you don't have then because it makes you feel shitty?"" He also said, to my utmost astonishment, ""I mean, I don't see the problem with comparing the two positions. It is obvious that my job has better benefits and perks than yours and I'm just pointing them out. You don't need to see that in a negative light.""

There was much more bullshit that came out of his mouth but after like two minutes of hearing him rant about how I was being too sensitive and restricting his happiness, I said, ""[his name], you are an absolute piece of shit. Everything you just said was not only extremely inconsiderate but very selfish."" I really really wanted to just yell at him and list off the hundreds of things that was wrong with what he said but instead, I refrained and just said, ""Dude, we're over.""

He said, ""What?!"" and I got up from his bed and bolted straight out the door. I've been ignoring his texts, calls, and  Facebook messages for the past few days. I actually feel like a huge weight has been lifted off of my shoulders. I'm enjoying my job more and overall, I just feel free as fuck. 

On a side note, there's this cute guy who sits two computers away from me at the lab I currently work at. ;)

TL;DR: I dumped the insensitive piece of shit. "
11,"My [20f] boyfriend [22m] is moping about how much sex we have. I am disgusted.


I've been together with my boyfriend for 6 weeks. It's our first official relationship, but we've dated around. 
Since we live with our parents so sex is a little bit of a treat for us, and we can maybe get a sesh in every week. Recently my boyfriend has started complaining (and even moping) about how much sex we have, saying ""he had expected more [sex] from a relationship"". He has been trying to get me to have sex with him in places I don't feel comfortable having sex (like the beach, on my friends couch, when we were taking a walk through the woods) and when I tell him no he mopes so normally I give in. I do not enjoy having sex with him, because after were done he just rolls off of me and I end up feeling used.
Thing is, I love the platonic side of our relationship. 
What can I do? I am tempted to break it off, since his childish attitude towards sex is such a turn off for me. 
Thanks in advance!

**tl;dr;** I want to break up with my boyfriend because of his childish attitude towards sex"
12,"i'm (F 21) starting to hate being around my best friend (F 23) due to her looks


i met my now best friend earlier this year. as soon as we met we clicked and have been best friends since. the first time i met her i was in awe from her beauty. she's tall, mixed, has this short blonde afro, a gorgeous face and a body anyone will KILL for. 

she recently broke up with her boyfriend and since its summer time, we've been going out a lot.. like every weekend. i've never considered myself ""ugly"". i've gained a little weight recently which has taken a huge tole on my self confidence, but still generally think i'm ok looking. 

every time we go out together she gets stopped by strangers to be told how beautiful they think she is, or men who want to get her number. this is fine, and i don't mind except that it's usually a reminder that i'm the ugly friend lol. 

last night we went out, and this was my breaking point. i got all dressed up and looked my absolute best. i felt really good. we met a bunch of friends while we were out. she was interested in this guy and asked our guy friend to introduce her. when he told his friend, his friend asked ""which one, the sexy one or no?"" i couldn't help but go to the bathroom and cry my eyes out. i already felt particularly shitty about myself that day, hence getting dressed to the nines. on top of this, we were talking to our guy friend about this guy i was talking to and my girlfriend says he's totally into you, our guy friend chimes in and says ""he's not, trusttt meee, he's not"". 

i act like these comments don't bother me, and maybe that's why people say these things to me but it's starting to drive me crazy. i've cried all day and avoided looking at myself. i love my best friend but going out with her is starting to make me resent her. i know it's not her fault by any means but it's just hard. we're suppose to go on a big trip together and i'm starting to just dread. i don't see how i could talk to her about this, ""hey you're too pretty, can't hang anymore""?? she already asked me to go out next weekend and i declined and now she's asking me why i'm being so weird towards her. 

i'm stuck between i love her and none of this is her fault, but i'm sorry being around you makes me feel horrible.

**tl;dr my best friends looks make me feel shitty about myself and makes me not want to be around her**"
13,"[UPDATE] My (22F) boyfriend (26M) has a higher sex drive than me


https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/8kjql5/my_boyfriend_26m_of_a_year_has_a_much_higher_sex/?st=JKLBPMXV&amp;sh=e88f2d1e

I know no one really paid attention to the first post but I thought I’d update if anyone was interested. Basically I didn’t follow most of the advice to break up, and chose to stick with my boyfriend. 

Me and my boyfriend had a big talk, which I had been avoiding massively. I kind of expect disagreements to involve lots of screaming, because that’s what my mum is like, but my boyfriend is nothing like that. I found it pretty weird because we just talked it out and then it solved itself, but neither of us were angry...

Anyways, we came up with a roster for sexual activity to happen on sundays and potentially Tuesday’s as well, and they involved handjobs/oral sex on either of us because it wouldn’t cause me discomfort. Before, it would sometimes be a bit more infrequent than the 1-2x a week I had estimated, particularly when I had a lot going on in my life and I just didn’t really want to endure sex. He felt the effect of these irregularities a lot more than me. 

We also went to a sex specialist, who informed me that I have a skin condition on my genitals, which causes pain during sex, and that in turn causes my vagina to contract and prevent sex. I suspect the skin condition has been lifelong because I have always had pain down there, but I wasn’t really taken to the doctor as a kid/teen, and I tend to think illnesses are all in my head anyways, which is a habit I’m trying to change. The specialist also mentioned that my dislike of intimacy may be due to my experiences with harassment, where guys have kissed me, groped me, and even tried to grab me off the street without my consent. When my boyfriend was super horny I would mentally lump him in with those guys and it would freak me out. 

Anyways, I’m getting treated for that now and it is slowly improving. We haven’t completely managed to have pain free sex yet, but it certainly has made other forms more enjoyable for me. Turns out my libido is higher when sexual activities don’t involve pain... My boyfriend has stopped getting as overbearingly horny now that we’re having sexy time more frequently too, which in turn means that I feel less overwhelmed.

Anyways, this has brought us a lot closer together, and has helped me feel comfortable to communicate better with my boyfriend. I realise that I was before avoiding communicating, because I was automatically expected screaming matches, but he is the most corny, romantic, and affectionate person ever, and he has never even slightly raised his voice at me. 

TL;DR: didn’t want to have a lot of sex with my boyfriend, and found it very uncomfortable. We talked it out and saw a doctor, who was able to treat the source of discomfort. "
14,"[UPDATE] Was I [25F] wrong in asking my boyfriend [23M] to not go on his family trip?


Original post: [https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/92c9i6/was\_i\_25f\_wrong\_in\_asking\_my\_boyfriend\_23m\_to\_not/](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/92c9i6/was_i_25f_wrong_in_asking_my_boyfriend_23m_to_not/)

I told him that I wouldn't be paying for the hotel and he left for his family vacation. I guess the ways we each viewed that situation was too different for him (my putting work priorities before family), so he broke up with me when he came back. He said our views are too different and he feels like a totally different person around me compared to when he's with his family or friends. He's always had a problem with my being shy and introverted. He almost broke up with me toward the beginning of our relationship because of it. He says I experience the world inwardly versus his experiencing it outwardly. I guess he was changing himself to accommodate that, and he didn't like it.

He also said he believes we could make it work, but he feels like there is more out there for him. I, like a needy fool, asked him to reconsider and move back in. So he kept me on a string for a week, saying we should give it another shot and changing his mind back to breaking up the next day. I finally called him today and said the back and forth had to stop, so he officially ended it. He has to come back next week to get the rest of his stuff, but that's it.

This was my first relationship so it's been hard. I cried at work a lot the first few days, and I've almost cried today after making it official. 

But, thanks everyone for all of the advice! He's felt this way for a while, so I would've hated to waste even more money on him if he was going to break up with me anyway. I also may make him sign an IOU for the plane ticket I bought for him to South Korea since he agreed to pay me back before I bought it. 

TL;DR: Didn't spend the $300. We broke up. It's been hard."
15,"My [30F] BF [34M] got a tattoo of something that is significant to a past relationship of his.


**TLDR:** My BF's ex created an artwork to commemorate their engagement. They have since broken up for almost a decade. My BF got that artwork tattooed on his arm just a few hours ago. 

I've dating my BF for five years now and everything is perfect. Outside of this issue (if it is even an issue) I very much expect to marry this man. Before my BF met me, he was engaged to his ex. He has been dating his ex since high school and proposed at 24. Before they could get married he received a job offer in another country that he simply could not refuse. His ex was adamantly against moving from her home country. To make a long story short, his ex gave him an ultimatum of being with her, or accepting the job offer. While he loved her more than the job, he ultimately decided to take the job nonetheless because he didn't want to be with a partner who would give him such ultimatums. Though they rarely communicate, they are friendly. 

A few weeks ago, my BF expressed his desire to get a tattoo. While I was not enthusiastic about the idea, it's his body so he can do as he wishes. I just asked that he didn't get something too obnoxious. He assured it will be a small subtle tattoo somewhere hidden. Well, it wasn't  a small subtle tattoo. It was a large piece that extended from his shoulder down to his elbows. If it were just any random piece of art, I could easily just get over my discontent. Unfortunately, the tattoo was not of just any random piece of art. 

His ex is an artist. When my BF proposed to his ex, she painted a very identifiable artwork of two lions to commemorate the occasion. I only know this painting exists because I was helping his family move one time (while he was at work) and his mum decided to tell me the history of why such a great painting was stashed away in boxes collecting dust. As far as I know, my BF doesn't know that I know this painting exists. This painting, or rather the two lions, is what my BF decided to get tattooed onto his arm. The tattoo isn't finished (he has to go in for multiple visits). But what is tattooed on his arm is readily identifiable as those lions. 

I saw his arm for the first time since the he had the work done just a few hours ago. I tried my best to feign happiness for him, and quickly excused myself and made up some story about seeing a friend for dinner. I have no idea what to think about this. On the one hand, his engagement was a big part of his life, and if he wants to treasure those memories that's his prerogative. But on the other hand, did he have to get the fucking lions tattooed on his arm so that it's always in my face?! 

What should I do? How should I feel? How egregious is this, if at all?  
"
16,"I [25/F] have a bad reputation that haunts me. Meeting BF’s [25/M] (of 4 months) parents and worried about how to handle it.


My BF and I grew up in a small suburb of a major city. It’s far enough away as to be a small community, but commutable. My BF’s dad commuted into the city and works as a financial executive at some company. BF’s parents donate to the schools, volunteer at events and are active in the community. My BF’s mom is a stay-at-home wife and is always doing things – she fills backpacks up with supplies &amp; clothes every fall for kids who don’t have new clothes/supplies; she volunteers at a clinic (she was a nurse) and helps teen moms and the homeless get fed, the medicine, etc. They’re the sort of all-American family. 

Our town isn’t huge so a lot of people know each other. I grew up without a father and with a drug addicted mother. Our apartment was a mess, our clothes were a mess and I developed a number of nicknames that involved crack, meth and a few about my supposed promiscuity. I routinely got one of his mother’s backpacks every year, and it was usually the only new socks &amp; underwear I would get. 

I had a rough time in high school, and the family situation deteriorated. I eventually lived with another relative, which was worse than my mother. I survived HS, but my reputation was in tatters. I was always with “the wrong crowd” mostly due to where we lived – I lived in a shit neighborhood, and because of that, we got a bad rep. I was never into drugs or alcohol, but my cousins were burn-outs in middle school; another cousin kept trying to steal from the pharmacy and was constantly arrested; another cousin is in jail… my mom was in-and-out of jail/rehab. I never had clean clothes (no washer &amp; dryer, no local laundromat) You get the picture. People saw us as white trash and called our area of town “the ghetto.” Every guy in school claimed to have had sex with me. Since I was trashy and poor, I must have also been promiscuous. People would claim we ""did it"" and no matter what I said, no one believed me. I stopped arguing with the accusations and just stayed silent. If people in high school were correct, I was nearing #400 by the time I finished my final exam in the 12th grade. 

BF is very definitely not from “the ghetto” but uptown from a beautiful house with a pool and a view of the city off in the distance. They live near the water and enjoy a great standing in town. When the town’s finances hit the skids in 2008, they hired BF’s father, who worked pro bono, on getting the town on track. 

Surprisingly, we were friends in high school. BF worked a part-time job to save for a trip and I often visited where he worked as they accepted food stamps. We’d chat about similar interests or TV or music or what have you and he was always nice to me at school. I always thought he was a really stand-up guy. He went off to university and only recently came back to live with his folks while he finishes dental school. Through happenstance, we bumped into each other and reconnected – I work in the dental field (I’m a receptionist/office manager) and so we had things to talk about and sort of just started dating. He hasn’t changed, was still very nice and charming. We’ve been dating about 4 months. I’ve put off meeting his folks. Some people in town think I was a promiscuous person, or that I was really on drugs and many have commented on how much “I turned myself around”. I even had one person tell me I “smell so much better.” Ouch. 

I put off meeting his folks and found ways to not be able to make events, but his family is hosting an event and I am out of excuses. I bought a nice party dress and plan to get my hair done, but just thinking about it is making me nauseated. BF’s brother remembers me and my not-so-nice cousin who used to steal from him. BF’s sister and I were in the same classes and I’m sure remembers me in dirty clothes and an unkempt appearance/trying to hide in the back of the room as I smelled (this was when mom thought she could use the bathtub to make hooch and so I didn’t bathe as often as I’d have liked). 

Everyone in town as a story about me. Most aren't true, but sadly people remember me. I'm terrified of meeting his family and don't know what to do. I feel like this will go horribly wrong and I don't want to lose this relationship. That said, if I keep putting it off, I'll doom the relationship. 

How should I handle this? Should I prepare answers to questions? Should I maybe script something out? Should I tell my BF I can't go? I really don't know how to attend an event like this or these people (all the guests are from yonder where I never ventured). Should I pretend like I don't remember/doesn't bother me? 

I'm really nervous and don't know what to say/do. 

tl;dr I grew up poor in a wealthy-ish area and am dating a nice guy from the wealthy part of town. His family donated clothes to me because I didn't have any and now I'm dating their son. I'm panic striken and don't know what to do/say.

17,"How can I (15f) make my mom (50f) feel prettier?


Tldr: my mom complains about her features constantly and I'm afraid she's doesn't realize how pretty she is because she's insecure. What can I do to make her feel pretty?

My mom turned 50 last month and she's always saying she's old and complaining about her looks but I love the way my mom looks, I love her Jewish nose and she has this white streak in her hair that even when she puts hair dye on it stays there (it's been there since she was like 25) and I think it's the coolest thing ever, like I actually want a white streak in my hair and I have since I was a child because it makes her look like a super hero. She has genetic dark circles but since my grandma had them too and I grew up thinking my grandma was the most beautiful woman ever I find them uniquely pretty. I think age should be celebrated because the older you get the more time you've spent on the earth and I think the veins on her legs are a sign of how hard she's worked throughout her life, I'm not gonna say she shouldn't think about her weight but it's not because she isn't pretty it's just because she has heart problems (even though she's at the high end of a normal bmi and not fat or even plus sized) but I wish she wouldn't think her weight makes her unattractive because she looks great. She had really bad teeth and has to wear fake ones now because her real teeth were messing up her mouth and hurting her constantly and she constantly apologizes for it even though I think her fake teeth look fine, like everyone outside our house has no idea she wears fake teeth so it just looks like she has perfect beautiful teeth.

I look like my dad but I wish I looked like my mom because I think she's so beautiful, she just doesn't see it. She hates having her picture taken and when I say I think she looks pretty she says ""I think your full of it"" it's in a playful way but I think she means it and I really want her to know she's beautiful. She had a very difficult childhood and a bad relationship with both of her parents and I think it made her really insecure.

How can make her realize how beautiful she is?"
18,"I [27F] blurted out ""please not here"" when my boyfriend [30M] was about to propose in the middle of a restaurant. I feel so guilty, I don't know how to fix it.


Throwaway.

My boyfriend and I have been together for a long time and I had sensed that a proposal was coming. I have always made it clear ( or thought I did) that when I am proposed to I want it to be very intimate with nobody around but the two of us. I am fairly shy and don't do public affection and can be very reserved and I didn't want to be free to cry etc when being proposed to by the man of my dreams.

I sensed some hints that he wanted to purpose and he suggested one day we do a date night and go to a nice restaurant. I was hoping that we would have a private room or he would take me out to a cozy spot after dinner...

Right at the end of dinner he got up and I noticed his hand going in his pocket and I could tell what was coming and people turned around (random people) to look at us and I automatically got so nervous and uncomfortable from people staring at me that I whispered ""Please not here"" ...he kind of stood back for a sec and did a face and said ""really?"" and I kind of just said nvm nvm go ahead and he proposed and I said yes obviously  and cried and we didn't talk about it ever again.

He brought it up once and said he was hurt by it and I again apologized and we have never talked about it again.

But I feel sooooo guilty. I tainted this amazing wonderful moment that you are supposed to remember for the rest of your life and I can't remember that moment without remembering my dumbness. What can I do? How do I get rid of the guild I feel, how do I make sure his proposal time is not tainted by me being an idiot.

Final note, I just want to say I had no doubts about him or saying yes. I still do not. He is my person.. I am just an idiot. lawl.

\*\*TL;DR;\*\*   I ruined by boyfriends proposal because I was embarrassed of the public place and said ""please not here"". Now we are about to get married and I still feel extremely guilty and horrible for what I did."
19,"Trying to tactfully lower new roommate's (27F) expectations of what co-habiting is like


**TLDR**: Roommate expects our living situation vis a vis food and cooking to fall along the lines of how you would live with your boyfriend, I need more freedom than that and am looking for a tactful way to express this.

Hello!

I (27F) just moved in with a friend (also 27F) last week. I've lived in many cities in my twenties, and this will be my fifth shared apartment - I would consider myself basically a veteran house-sharer (I've truly seen it all). 

My roommate and I have known each other for more than four years, get along well and have similar senses of humour, taste in TV, etc. I think we have good potential chemistry for living together (I've had enough meh roommates to know them when I see them).

Here's the rub, however: My roommate has never had roommates before. I am her first platonic roomie, as she was living with a (now ex) boyfriend for a year before me, and her parents before that. The fact that her first time living outside of her parent's place was with her boyfriend has (I think) skewed her idea of what co-habiting looks like. 

This becomes a problem mainly in the groceries and cooking department. I totally understand why she has the impression that two people living together would logically marry their eating habits together as well, since that has been her experience with people she's lived with up until now. When you live with your parents or partner, sharing groceries and cooking each meal together makes sense because you spend a lot of your time together, and your inclination to share runs much deeper.

But from my vantage, the reality of two adults sharing groceries and cooking feels difficult and a bit limiting. My cooking habits are pretty mercurial, and I'm not a meal planner in any sense. I also have a tight food budget that I've happily maintained for the last few years.

In my other living situations, its always worked out that everyone buys their own food, sharing staples like flour, spices, and in some cases eggs.

When I moved in with my friend, however, she sort of immediately assumed we'd be going in on everything together, much like she did with her ex when they lived together. She was so excited for us to be rooming together and cooking together that I let her plan some of our meals together. I'm seeing now that I goofed, and should have been clear from the start that I prefer to cook and buy my own food.

The problem really is that I feel like it will come off as a slight if I say I don't want to share food and groceries with her anymore. Am I overthinking this? Is there a not-weird way of revoking a commitment to sharing food? Help! I want this living situation to feel open and pleasant, and am worried I'm shooting it down before it can become that."
20,"My [27M] girlfriend [26F] of 5 months won't speak to me after finding out I have a work phone. Time to end things?


Hey everyone, 

Strange problem presented itself yesterday. I've been seeing this girl for a little while now and things have been great. For some background, I'm a consultant in regulatory finance. As such, we deal with some pretty sensitive data and are required to have a work-only phone due to the data that's on there. This hasn't come up in 5 months because I've been ""on the bench"", meaning not on a client, basically since we started seeing eachother, so I've had no reason to check or pull out my work phone at home. But a month ago I started on a new project and this week was the first week where it's been necessary for me to respond &amp; look at email updates I'm getting on my work phone. This is where the problem started. 

So, also for background, she fully knows the type of work that I do. She's a PHD candidate at the local university here but still generally understands what I do. She also understands that I can't really talk about most of my clients, given that most don't really want people to know that they have regulatory consultants cleaning up their messes. So she was totally fine when I told her I got off the bench a month ago to start work for a ""large regional bank"" in the Southwest. That's literally all the detail I'm allowed to give. 

The other night, we're hanging at home catching up about our days. I'm talking about how things are starting to pick up a bit at work, and that reminds me that I should probably check on a nightly report I'm responsible for forwarding on to my internal team members. So I walk over to my work bag, pull out the phone and start checking my email. She absolutely freezes and freaks out on me. Why I have a second phone, why I haven't ever mentioned this before, what kind of job needs a second phone, etc. I try to calm her down by showing her the phone (I can't let her poke around on it but it's pretty clearly a workphone, with a barcode on the case and my firm's logo as the screensaver) but she's absolutely insistent that she look *through* my texts and emails. There's 0 way I can let her do that because of what's on there and although I trust her to not go spout of off about the contents of my emails to Bloomberg or whoever, that is a hard no for me. I told her to literally go onto our company website and call the number from my virtual business card (it's listed right there) but she was adamant she needed to look through it. I refused again, and she left for the night saying we're not talking until I let her go through my phone. 

I haven't heard from her yet today, but I apologized over text that I didn't let her know I had this work phone because I didn't really think it was relevant at all. This has been a short relationship and we get along pretty well, but I'm really not sure what to make of all this. Any advice? 

TL;DR: Girlfriend found out I have a work phone that I can't let her scroll through and isn't talking to me anymore. What should I do? "
21,"Me [27 M] with my fiancé [24 F] had a disagreement what to do in case of being married, having a child and wanting a divorce, she scared me and made me anxious about our future


Hey guys.

Todays conversation with my fiancé went south. It wasn’t a fight or an argument by no means, but what I’ve heard and seen made me anxious. I don’t know how to come in terms with myself.

We planned our marriage to take place in 18 months. I love her, very much. She is the first girl that made me want to have kids, but now, after convo I’m not sure anymore.

Up until now we were talking about having kids all the time, I really wanted to be a dad, but since I’m a cautious person I do have to consider future events that can take place, I want to know what to expect.

She is from a broken family. Her parents divorced in a brutal manner when she was 18, but their marriage was shit long before that. Basically she didn’t have a dad, he was always abroad, didn’t give a shit about her and still doesn’t. It clearly was devastating to her and left scars that will never disappear.

She always talked about kids in a way that suggested they are to most valuable creatures in the world, with which I agree. She thinks that there is no sacrifice that can’t be made to make kids lives better.

Recently in her family a quite interesting situation occurred. Her cousin has a wife. The wife got obese, she has an affair and is cheating on him. He does the same thing, he even goes for a vacation with his mistress. They won’t get a divorce any time soon. Now here is where a disagreement in our thinking comes in.

My fiance insists that this way is somehow better for the kids than getting the divorce and starting over. In her opinion it’s better to act like the marriage is all ok just for the kids until they finish their degrees(around 25 yr old in our country, so around 15 more years for her cousin and his wife). 

I on the other hand think, that such behaviour can be even more damaging to the kids, than simply getting a divorce and splitting time with the kids. Both parties will grow resentful, angry and unhappy. People staying in marriages “just for the kids” will feel like prisoners for the next 5-20 years. Kids are not stupid, blind little humans. They see how parents act, everyday and those emotions will eventually be unleashed by husband or wife leaving the kids feeling like they’ve lived in a lie the whole time.

The conversation turned into her monologue, in which she raised her tone and was angry as hell. It’s the first time I’ve seen her in this state. She brought up a situation of her guy friend, in which he got a girl pregnant, then 2 years after the child was born he divorced her and left her - “because he was bored”.

I pointed out that we don’t know what was going on, maybe he didn’t just get bored, maybe there were some serious underlying issues that pushed him to leave her.

My fiancé ignored it and went on with the rant. She literally told me that guys like him should be put down like animals, it scared me how vicious she was. I just know, that if such situation happened to us - me wanting a divorce when we have a kid - she would destroy me to the core and wished me death. It’s not everything she has said, but that’s basically her point.

Now I’m a realist. There could be a situation in our future, when we have a kid, where we would no longer want to be with each other. We could grow apart, whatever. I don’t want to be a prisoner living for 20 years in fear of getting a divorce, because my wife will destroy my life(conclusion based on our discussion). I’m sitting here for an hour thinking about it and I’m honestly having doubts about still wanting to have a child with my fiancé. Her way of talking and what she said made me anxious about our future, if things go wrong.

Is this normal? Do you think I should seriously reconsider marrying her? Is it wrong for me to have doubts based on what I've heard?

I tried to discuss the issue with her, but she told me that she won't change her mind no matter what. She also told me I won't understand because my parents didn't get a divorce and so on.

\*\*tl;dr\*\* My fiancé went on a rant about people who don’t want to stay married just for kids. I realised that when things would go wrong between us if we had a child, she would destroy my life."
22,"Update: My [25yr F] mother [50yr F] does not respect boundaries or that I work shift work, anytime I approach the subject she becomes “hurt” that I am upset.


Original post: https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/90n0fs/my_25yr_f_mother_50yr_f_doesnt_respect_boundaries/


So, first off: I wanted to thank everyone who took the time to message me or comment. I realized that the issues here are partly my fault for allowing them to happen or continue. That sucked to realize, but now I’ve got the start of a spine.

That said, I dropped the Ford off at the shipping company yesterday morning.

I bought a 2017 Jeep Wrangler two nights ago. I’m very happy with it.

I still haven’t spoken to my mother, though she’s been sending family after me via text and phone calls.

My stepdad threatened that if I didn’t start talking to her again, “someone might show up at your doorstep”. So that won’t go over well if that happens.

Mother doesn’t know that the Ford is en route to her. I’ll update when I know what her reaction is.

I received this message from my mother last night:

“I am very worried about you. I have not heard from you in over a month now. I find this to be out of character for you. We need to talk. We need to agree on a happy medium on how often we communicate. I understand that you are busy with work and a new relationship. I cannot understand why no communication. A phone call takes only a few minutes. A response to a text takes seconds”

And:

“Let me know when you will be calling otherwise I am headed out to you as I am on vacation for the next few weeks”

I haven’t replied. I don’t think I will. If I do, I’m not going to be very polite. I took my job partially to get away from her, and I haven’t told her that. I will tell her if she keeps pushing me. At the end of the day, I don’t want to be mean or hurtful. I’ve tried the polite route, I’ve tried the not-so-polite route. I feel like I’m being forced toward being a bitch to her.

I guess that’s something I will need to be okay with.

tldr: I got rid of the shitty truck, got a sweet Wrangler and was an Adult. Mother doesn't know yet, and has threatened to just show up at my residence if I don't give in and talk to her."
23,"Virgin boyfriend [M22] tried to guilt trip me [F21] into having sex with him and I don‘t know how to proceed


We‘ve been together for 6 weeks and we‘re both still virgins. I’m his first girlfriend and he seems to be suffering from the fact that he‘s a virgin a lot more than me.

A week ago he texted me and asked if we could meet up for sex for the first time. When I told him that I wasn’t ready for sex yet, he started to beg and say that he was suffering from the fact that we haven‘t had sex and that „a man needs sex“. 
When I wouldn‘t give in, he sent me photos of him (fake?)-crying to show me how much he‘s suffering and told me about all the things he has done for me and that now it was my turn to do something for him, meaning having sex with him. I was shocked by his sense of entitlement and disregard for my feelings. I got really weirded out and texted him multiple times that I wasn’t ready. He was clearly trying to guilt trip me into having sex with him by acting like he‘s suffering and I „owe“ him.

I finally had enough and told him that I needed more time and if he can‘t accept that, we need to break up.
It was only then he changed his approach. He told me he was an idiot and didn’t want to lose me and apologized for acting the way he did. We then met in person to talk about it, he again apologized repeatedly for what he did and told me that he doesn’t care how long he has to wait for sex, it could be one week, month or even year.
Apparently, that day was an important date to him, because his favorite musician died and his favorite sports team won a game, and thats why he wanted to lose his virginity on that exact date. 
What bothers me is that he tried to emotionally manipulate me into have sex with him, and I don‘t know if I was wrong for accepting his apology.
He hasn‘t mentioned sex since then and asked if we could go on a „normal“ date again but what he did is still bothering me. 
Am I overthinking? Is it just his inexperience with girls and rejection that made him act that way? 

**tl;dr**

Boyfriend is a virgin and started begging for sex

When I wouldn‘t give in, he tried guilt tripping me into having sex by sending me photos of him crying, implying that I owe him sex.

He then apologized a lot for acting that way but it‘s still bothering me quite a lot and I don’t know if I‘m overreacting..."
24,"I [31M] don't know how to handle having more responsibility than I was ready for thrust on me.


I apologize if this is incoherent. It's 1AM on a Saturday, I'm somewhat drunk, and chances are I'll delete this in the morning.

I'm 31. I'm married, I have one kid with another due in ~3 months. My wife is a stay-at-home mom. I live close to my widowed mother.

The day before my wedding, I was 25. My father was still alive. My to-be-wife had just quit her retail position because I told her she could: she barely made enough to afford gas and the clothes her job required, let alone gas from our new apartment. I was embarking on my new life as a husband tasked with supporting my wife and upcoming family.

Two years later, I had a child. In the meantime, my father died. I suddenly had to become the provider not only for my stay-at-home wife and this newly-born child, but also my widowed mother. Four people, all relying on me. (Plus pets.)

I quickly discovered that my wife... is a child. I don't mean that as insultingly as it sounds. She went to college, she graduated, but she never had more than a part-time retail job. Her income from that always went to just paying for gas or the clothes the job required. She lived with her parents when they stopped paying for her college. She graduated with $20K in debt (which I quickly paid off after we were married).

My child, of course, is a child. What I also discovered is that my mother, without my father, is a child. She can't handle the most basic maintenance or administrative task. I have to handle all her repairs, renovations, bills, etc. She pays them, but she's incapable of scheduling them, making a customer service call, handling an invoice. She's helpless, and so I have to fill in the role of my father for her.

So, Two years after I was a single bachelor responsible for only myself, I suddenly had all these people depending on me. And they're children. Neither my mother nor my wife can handle the slightest fucking bit of criticism before going off into a sobbing hole for a day. Today, I got upset that my daughter had colored crayon all over the walls while my wife, sitting 20 feet away, was farting around on Facebook paying no attention whatsoever. Later that day, when I went to visit my mother, she was sobbing because she was going to have to replace a defective water heater. The company acknowledged it was defective, they were replacing it free of charge, and all she had to fucking do was be available to let them in to do their work. But that was too fucking much for her: she asked if I could take a day off work to be there to let them in. And I said yes, because she was fucking crying at me.

I'm just so sick of it. My mother, my wife, my actual child, they're just all children looking to me to just take care of them. My kid gets a pass, of course, but the other two: they're just as much adults as me. I'm working two jobs, they're retired or staying at home (respectively), and yet they can't handle a single fucking thing without me. It all falls on me.

And when I dare to suggest that this is too much? Tears. So many fucking tears. Every single fucking day, all three of them cry at me for one thing or another.

I just don't know what to do anymore. I work two jobs. My wife is constantly spending money on shit that we don't need, but when I call her on it, she goes to fucking pieces. Cries about how she's an awful wife. Promises to do better and then never fucking does. My mother? She asks me every week to take time off work to do something she's entirely physically capable of doing herself, but has decided she's emotionally incapable of handling. And if I say no, more tears.

On top of all this, he was my fucking father. I wasn't ready to lose him. I'm all alone without him. I can't talk to my wife or mother because any slight suggestion I'm unhappy leads to tears from them about the role they might have in that. I have no friends to talk to because, again, I work two jobs and spend all the rest of the time doing whatever the two of them can't manage to do themselves. I never got to mourn because I had to jump straight into caretaking mode. That was 5 years ago and I'm no closer to being over it today than I was the day he died.

Today I broke down sobbing in the living room. My 3-year-old kid had to come up to me and give me a teddy bear and tell me it was going to be okay. I'm at a point where I have to rely on my 3-year-old for support because I don't fucking get it anywhere else, and if I suggest I need that, I just get tears from people so self-obsessed with their own situation that hearing I'm struggling just makes them more self-pitying about their inability to help me. I end up apologizing for asking people to serve the basic support purposes anyone needs.

I just want my father back. I wasn't ready for him to die. I wasn't ready to fulfill the roles he filled. I wasn't ready to _be_ a father, at least not with a wife whose emotional maturity is barely over 16 herself. I wasn't ready for any of this. And I'm not blameless: I agreed to have our first kid, I agreed to have our second kid. The first was mostly to cheer my mother up after my father died. The second was because my wife had been crying about how I didn't want a second kid for years, and finally I gave in and said I'd entertain the idea... which meant she jumped to assuming we were actively trying. Any comment from me to the contrary was greeted with tears again.

I'm just so alone. I have no one to talk to. I wasn't ready to be a father or a son of a widow. I'm not ready for a second kid. I didn't want any of this, and now I'm trapped and I have no idea what to fucking do about any of it.

TL;DR: In two years, I went from living alone (engaged) to being the sole caretaker for my wife, child, and widowed mother, and I wasn't ready for that. I'm still not ready for that. I don't know how to recover, and I'm miserable every day because I feel like I have no support. And I just want my dad back."
25,"I [F20] won’t help my Dad’s mom [F60’s] and it’s causing problems


Growing up my Dad’s mom has never acknowledged my sister and I as her grandkids because we are girls. I remember being young and going over to visit and she would ask my dad when he is having another kid to try for that son. The times we would visit for Christmas, my sister and I never got gifts while our male cousins did. This different treatment would upset us and we eventually stopped going. It wasn’t just my sister and I, but our other female cousins too. I still remember on Christmas my sister crying outside because our male cousins were teasing her to “pick up” after them. I remember asking my dad, “are you’re mad sissy and I are girls”. My dad said not he’s just happy to have two healthy daughters. My mom was furious over this treatment and we stopped visiting her for holidays. She was always invited to our birthday parties and graduation parties, but was always “too busy”. Over the years I don’t acknowledge her as a grandparent and just call her ‘my Dad’s mom’. 

Now, my dad said she broke her wrist (she fell and caught herself wrong) and needs help grocery shopping. He asked if I can do it for my ‘grandma’ and I told him no. I’m busy with school (summer classes &amp; then fall semester) plus volunteer work I do. My dad got angry because I can’t do one thing for my own grandma. Long story short we go into it (nothing physically just yelling). I told him, “if she needs help, why doesn’t she ask her grandsons. I’m sure they will be more than happy to help their grandma”. My dad says my cousins are living with her and unemployed. If they didn’t live with her they’d be homeless. I mention my dad 5 other brothers and he says they’re not the kind to help their mom. Then it turns to that, “I’m being immature” and I should help because “family... god... love”. My mom comes home and tells my dad that he can do some grocery shopping for his mom. My dad says he’s too busy, but was telling me too. My mom says she will do it. End of story right? No.

My dad calls his mom and she doesn’t want help if it’s from my mom. My dad isn’t angry, but now upset because his mom needs help. It’s been from Monday now and my dads still upset about it. My mom says she just wants to cause drama and fighting. That she has always been this way since they gotten married. 


**Td;lr Dad is upset I won’t help his mom, after she broke her wrist, with grocery shopping. Any solutions here? **"
26,"Is it fucked up for him to do this? [21 both]


L    o    n    g   p   o   s   t

So when we first got together, I warned my boyfriend that I was about as interesting as a blank sheet of paper and had just about the social skills of a fork. So he said that it's okay, and that he'd wait for me to loosen up. Or something to that extent. I don't remember.  


So for the longest time (aka two years), he let me be my old socially awkward self. He sometimes felt a bit annoyed that I couldn't hold a conversation for more than  five minutes. I did do my best to never give up on him and to support him emotionally. I stumbled a lot, but god damn I tried. I'm not sure I did much but he assured me that I was doing fine.

  
Enter my best friend from elementary school. She's way better at conversation than I am, and my boyfriend and her hit it up pretty well. They'd have conversations for hours. It didn't help that I acquired a full-time job (so that I'd have an excuse to be out of the house) so I didn't have as much time to hang out with him as I wanted. My friend is still a full-time student, and my boyfriend works in a way that gives him some chunks of free time, so they hung out a lot. It got to the point where he admitted to admiring her and having a crush on her, mostly because she had some kind of social presence.  


Now in light of him tolerating my crappy social skills, he decided that there would be no more waiting for me to get better at talking (two years is too long to become better at talking to people you should be close with I guess), so he put his foot down. Before, he'd respond a lot and tolerate my pathetic attempts at talk. Now he won't even respond if it's something that doesn't provoke good conversation. I really have to work hard to think of something worthy to discuss, but so far I've failed. I tried talking about my thoughts, Nestle slavery, the weather, but nothing worked. He's still aloof and essentially making me work harder to get his interest.   


Now the question is: is this fucked up? I'm getting real bad vibes from this (I got an anxiety wave so bad at work today that I was out of commission for a couple of hours, which never happens) and I'm feeling generally hurt. I told him about this, but he said he can't lower the bar. He wants results. Is it wrong for me to be upset and want to break it off?  


I think I should mention that I promised I would be a better person for him. This is part of it, apparently.  


TL;DR : Boyfriend wants me to be better at talking and is using the cold shoulder to force me to make conversation. Is this fucked up?"
27,"Is what [M/27] is asking of me [F/26] reasonable after a couple of months of dating?


I have been dating him for about two months now. Not a long time in my book, but we have spent almost every single day together (I'll usually pack a bag, so I can stay over at his place at the end of the day) so the attachment on my part is there. At the start, he made sure to bring up his expectations with raising kids and said he was looking for his wife. I decided to give it a shot and stopped dating the other men I had previously been dating. 

Fast forward to now when I have feelings for the guy because we've been spending so much time together. I see he's actively using his dating profile online. It comes as a little bit of a surprise to me, so I ask him about it. I don't remember the conversation too well, but I know I told him that I did not want to accept him meeting other women while he was dating me. At that moment I felt as if I wasn't entertaining enough for him, and that I had caused to go back out looking for someone new. 

We end the conversation with me not wanting to continue to date anymore. He goes out with his friends, and later in the night, I receive a phone call and a text. I don't reach the phone call, but I read the text. 

""I don't feel right not talking with you. I really do care about you. If you choose you don't want to see me anymore I really do understand, but I am hoping we can talk more about this. I respect you very much and truly enjoy spending time with you.""

I tell him I don't want to spoil his night with his friends and to continue focusing on having a good time with them. He says..

""I do not want to commit right now to you. That does not mean I can't in the future. I do however want to go on dates. I want to see who's out there. But I also want you. I will never lie to you. As I said I respect you. I don't ever want to cause you pain. I appreciate everything that you do for me. And all the support and interest you show in my passions. If this is not something you can do right now, I really understand. I will be very upset. But I will understand. I will respect your wishes whatever they are.""

He asks me to think about it. I tell him I just can't do it. That I'm not interested in competing with other women for his feelings. I don't want to fall in love with the guy just to have him choose someone else in the end. We're both great catches. I think we'd be great together. He's just not ready for a commitment, and I understand and respect that. So, do I just lose? Did I fall too quickly for him? Am I in the wrong for wanting to be dating exclusively? There are so many questions I have. Is this something I should agree to even though I know him spending time with other women is always going to be in the back of my mind? 

tl;dr Dating a guy that does not want to commit and is asking for me to accept him dating others while still being with me."
28,"UPDATE: My (20M) Girlfriend (20F) Says That She’s Too Busy To Spend Time Together But Goes To The Gym With My Friend/Housemate (20M) Every Day


Original post: [https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/94b40y/my\_20m\_girlfriend\_20f\_says\_that\_shes\_too\_busy\_to/](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/94b40y/my_20m_girlfriend_20f_says_that_shes_too_busy_to/)

First of all I want to say thank you to EVERYONE who joined the conversation on my problem. I was blown away by the response, and it really got me thinking about the relationship and what I really want. I want to recognize the fact that the title of the post and the issue with her going to the gym with my buddy is the very VERY tip of the iceburg.

I was out of town for \~1 week and had a lot of time to think about it all. I stayed with family, worked, and met some new people. After talking to anyone that would listen, and reading all the comments on the previous post, I realized that I wasn't happy with the relationship the way it is, and neither was she. If I'm going to invest time, thought, and energy in a relationship, I think it needs to be with someone who will give me the time of day, and not play games (silent treatment, etc.) While I was gone, I made up my mind. It was easy to do because she continued to give me the silent treatment 

Today, I talked to her about it. I told her that it seemed like she'd been checked out of the relationship for a while, that I can't feel like my relationship with someone I love is always on the edge. Apparently she was hoping that I would come back, and we would try to work things out. This surprised me because she hasn't treated me remotely like a boyfriend for a couple weeks now. She talked about how many good times we had together, how I was ""throwing it all away"" because she wasn't giving we enough of her time. I got weak. I wanted to tell her that I was sorry, that I wanted to stay together and I was sorry for overreacting. But then I remembered that it really didn't matter what happened, because the relationship was bound to end, and the longer we waited the worse. I think I really hurt her today. I told her that she's a good person and that she will do amazing things with her life, and that I don't want us to be on bad terms. I said that it would be weird for a while but maybe we could be friends one day.

It was harder than I could've imagined. But I had to do it. Otherwise she would, but she'd let us both suffer for longer. I do love her, but I don't love *us* anymore.

TL;DR    I dumped her (like many of you suggested) because I realized we had more problems than I could manage on my own, and I think we both deserve better. I hurt her feelings but I'm glad I found the strength."
29,"Should I (33F) tell my ex’s (28M) girlfriend that he pathetically contacted me?


Dated my ex (28M) for nearly 5 years...serious, lived together, marriage/family talks...until about 9 months ago I (33F) abruptly found out he was cheating.  I ended things (this wasn’t his first indiscretion) and kicked him out. He claimed he wasn’t cheating, just inappropriately texting an old friend, and denied everything. 

Less than a week after he moved out, the other girl (who previously didn’t know I existed) found me on social media, saw indications that we had been together for several years, and felt obligated to tell me her story. We engaged in a long, mature discussion to exchange notes and come to find out they had been dating for 2 years. Her and I were both shocked, disgusted, and amazed by the effort he put into deceiving us both. Ended the conversation politely and went our separate ways.

Fast forward to present day, apparently she took him back over 6 months ago and they’ve been dating and living together ever since. Super, don’t care. However, he emailed me a week ago apologizing, saying losing me was the worst thing to happen, his life has been miserable every day since then, yada yada.

So now I face a moral dilemma. I did not and will not be responding, but should I tell his now girlfriend? She once reached out to me as a courtesy of sorts, do I do the same? The info she gave me insured I would never forgive him or think of taking him back, saving me from further heartbreak. I’d hate for anyone to have to be duped by him like I was. Do I tell her?

TL;DR - Dumped ex for cheating. His other unsuspecting girl reached out to me to tell me the details and saved me from further heartache. They’re now together and he has contacted me in an attempt to get me back. I’m not interested, but should I tell her?"
30,"Am I(29m) over-reacting about my wife(25f)


My wife is in rehab for heroin, 2000 miles away.  We've been married for 4 years in October, and have one son.  I don't have any drug problems, I drink socially at most.  But since she's been in rehab, our relationship has been struggling.  She's been gone for around 45 days now, and the distance is killing us.  In the last 2 weeks, she admitted to have feelings for someone(a guy who's in rehab).  I asked her to cut ties(delete him off of Facebook, stop hanging out around him) because she is married with a family and getting involved with anyone would be a rash decision, especially an ex-convict with a history of meth use. I've never worried about her being unfaithful until now.  When I first asked her to cut ties she agreed and said she wasn't thinking when she let herself get feelings for him, and that she wants to come home to her family after she completes this program.  That was 3 days ago, and she now refuses to cut ties and even has posted a few selfies with him and hearts all of his pictures on Facebook.  When I confronted her about it, she called me immature and insecure.  So yesterday I told her that I can't do this anymore, that her not keeping her word or respecting me or boundaries in general is more then I can handle and want a divorce.  I was willing to forgive her and support her through her addiction, but I'm not willing to wait around while she messes around in California.  She's making me feel like she just wants to keep me around so she'll have somewhere to come back to, and someone to send her money.  Her family has since disowned her, not willing to help her at all.  Am I over-reacting? I don't feel like I am, but I'm also an emotional wreck since she left.

TL/DR: wife turned out to be a junkie, went to rehab, caught feelings for a meth junkie from another state and can't respect boundaries or my feelings.  Now I can't figure out if I'm over-reacting."
31,"Boyfriend (30M) is mad that I (25F) Ubered home and ""ruined night""


Starting at 7:30pm, we met up with some friends for dinner and drinks. After that, everyone wanted to go out downtown. I told my boyfriend I needed to be back by 2am because I have work in the morning, so if he wants to stay out later than that I can take a seperate car or just not go. He assured me he didn't want to be out that late and to go with him. 

Fast forward to 1:15am, he's still going strong and doesn't want to leave. I was fine with that, I figured it might happen, so I decided to just call an Uber (by the time an uber got there, took me back to my car, then I drove home, it would be a bit past 2). He said I was ruining the night for everyone, but clearly no one but him was bothered. The rest of our friends just gave me a hug and said bye. He kept trying to talk me into staying, that work didn't matter, that I was a ""buzz kill"", that I'm no fun, that I ruined it for everyone, etc. It was annoying, but I blamed it on the alcohol. 

Fast forward to today, he is still upset and will barely talk to me. I feel like he is being entirely inconsiderate and selfish. I don't like showing up to work hungover on two hours of sleep, sorry. I didn't demand he take me back home, or ask him not to hang out with his friends, I just paid my own way home when it was time... 

I have no idea how he thinks he's justified to be mad, or am I looking at this from the totally wrong perspective? 

TLDR: Boyfriend told me we'd be back by 2am, it became apparent that wouldn't happen, so I Ubered home. He's mad that I ruined night. "
32,"My [27f] boyfriend [24m] has a problem with my ""ethics""


My boyfriend of around three months, Tom, told me he has a problem with some of my ethical choices. I don't understand his point of view at all.

Examples: 

1. I told him I refused to give a job reference for someone I had major personal problems with. I don't want him working with me. I would have done it if I felt that not doing it could hurt me in some way in the future, but I doubt I will ever see the guy who asked for the reference again, so I felt comfortable saying no. I think that guy had a lot of nerve asking me for a favor, but Tom said I should have agreed anyway.

2. Tom thinks I lie too much. I disagree. I'll tell white lies if telling the truth would be more awkward and the person is not owed the truth because it's none of their business. He talked about when we recently ran into a friend of mine, and she asked why I hadn't been at a major event that had happened. I said I had been having a bad headache so decided to stay home. In reality, I was at home having an anxiety crisis, but I'm not good enough friends with this woman to tell her that, so I lied. Tom thinks I shouldn't have lied.

I asked Tom why I needed to tell this person my private issues. He said I didn't, but instead of lying, I should have told her that I didn't go to the event for private reasons, and that I didn't want to discuss it. I think that would have been extremely awkward. I don't think my friend even cared that much to know why I wasn't at the event, she was just making conversation. I think it's so much easier to just make up a small lie that nobody will care about than to do what Tom suggested.

3. I applied for a training program at work that's a big deal and hard to get into. I'm pretty new to the job, so I didn't find out about the program until I heard a coworker talking about how he applied for the program. I thought the program sounded great so I applied too. I happened to mention to Tom how I found out about the program because I was using it as an example of how my workplace never actually tells anyone anything and everything is based on employee gossip. Tom didn't say anything negative at the time.

But when I found out I got accepted into the program, Tom asked if that coworker had gotten in too. I said no. Tom told me I shouldn't have done that, because I took an opportunity away from someone who had done the research to find out about the program on his own. 

4. I've been trying to work with Someone involving an important personal issue and the person is obviously not very competent. He keeps messing things up, doing the wrong thing and generally slowing things down. Tom asked me why the process was going so slowly and I said ""the guy probably forgot how to read."" I wondered if it would be worth it to complain about the guy to his supervisor. Tom said that was really rude and that while my complaints were valid, joking about how the guy couldn't read showed I just wanted to complain to the guy's boss for malicious reasons not to actually solve anything.

I don't do any of these things to be a jerk. He is upset because in all those situations I put myself first ahead of others, but I think he's overreacting just because he would've made different choices.

I'm feeling very judged and tired of having my behavior ripped apart. I want to make Tom understand but I'm concerned that we're just not very compatible and he'll never understand. How can I explain my point of view without sounding like someone who only cares about herself?

Tldr: my boyfriend has a problem with my behavior and thinks I'm treating others badly"
33,"I [15M] have been sent to live with my grandfather [70M] and nobody tells me why. My parents [50M, 45F] don't talk to me and my sisters [18F, 17F] have blocked me.


It's been 3 months and I don't know why. I've been told to not return home on my own, not call and not make any contact. On second day I texted my sisters asking what's going on and they both blocked my number and blocked me on other social apps. When I call my parents they don't pick up. When I text them they only reply that I shouldn't contact them until they contact me. My grandfather doesn't tell me anything he only says that I should wait and I'll eventually know.

What the hell am I supposed to do? I don't know why they're treating me like this but I know I haven't done anything to deserve this. But it seems like they believe I've done something wrong and they're punishing me.

tldr: I've been sent to live with my grandfather without any explanation and my family has cut all contact with me. I don't know why and I need help figuring things out and deciding what to do. "
34,"How do I get my [26F] apartment mate [25F] to stop inviting herself to ""join me"" in eating my meals?


I’ve known my friend Lynn for 4 years after meeting at work. We decided to live together and rent an apartment together near work. Lynn is a kind, chill, and sweet person and has for the most part been awesome to live with. 

The issues began when Lynn’s financial troubles started to catch up with her. She graduated with student loans and got herself into thousands of dollars of needless debt with her spending habits. Lynn spends impulsively on random items that she will quickly lose interest in, constantly eats out at places she can’t really afford, and never turns down expensive group outings.  It’s really common for me to here Lynn complain that she only has $100 to live off for the entire month, or that she’s so happy she got her paycheck because she only had $9 left in her account, etc.  

This is roughly when the mooching began. We both love cooking and making nice meals, so it was common for us to ask each other about what we’re preparing and sample each other’s dishes once in a while. However, once she was in deep shit financially I noticed she would often “join me for dinner” and simply eat my food without offering any of hers (which is what we used to do). I stopped offering her any of my meals, but she was persistent in asking me or strongly and obnoxiously hinting for food anyways. 

Examples:

1.	On Valentine’s Day I mentioned that I was cooking a fancy seafood dinner for my boyfriend. She tells me my plan sounds great and a few minutes later she says, “I was thinking I could join you guys for dinner”. I got really thrown off by the question and answered something along the lines of “ummmm…”. She still didn’t get it and said “Hmm, I’m sensing some hesitation, is there a problem?”.

2.	My boyfriend and I were making eggs and baking some biscuits for breakfast. She strolls into the kitchen and says, “Hey mind if I join you for breakfast?”. We obviously had a lot of biscuits, so I felt weird saying no but it made us both uncomfortable. 

3.	I was making tomato soup and grilled cheese sandwiches for my boyfriend and I for dinner. Again, we obviously had plenty of soup, so she invited herself to sit down and eat our food with us. 

4.	My good friend was feeling down, so I invited her to come over and have some cookies and ice cream. My boyfriend very kindly baked the cookies for us while I consoled my friend. In the meantime, Lynn was trying coach him on how to make the cookies to her own liking (even though she was never offered any). When he asked me and my friend if he could get us a bowl of ice cream Lynn immediately said “oooh yes *I’ll* have some” (again it was not offered to her”. She took the biggest scoop(s) and left hardly any for us. Then when the cookies were baked she took HANDFULS of them. I was so pissed, but I didn’t want to make any drama while I had a guest over. Lynn also made a cheesecake that same night and didn’t offer any to us. 

I could go on and on with these examples. Basically, she lingers around me while I’m cooking or eating and strongly hints that she likes what she sees. If I don’t say anything she’ll invite herself to my food and make it awkward for me to say no (because I usually cook a lot at once). It’s now at the point where I will cook and then leave the house and eat because I know she’ll try and mooch off my meals. 

My questions are how do I nicely and tactfully say NO when she tries to “join me” in eating my food? And how do I address her past “mooching” without hurting her feelings (she suffers from depression and tends to internalize any critique)?

\*\***TL;DR**\*\* My roommate spends money recklessly then mooches off my meals because she thinks she's too poor to buys her own food. How do I kindly get her to stop?"
35,"My mom is upset with me that my brother is not in my wedding party


I (34M) got engaged last year to my wonderful fiancé (27F) after a few years of dating. We are very happy are looking forward to a stable, boring life together. Our wedding is next summer, so we have a two year engagement to get all our plans taken care of with plenty of time to get the wedding details sorted. We have just finalized our wedding party selections and notified our friends that we have chosen. Keep in mind, we have not sent any guest list out yet nor have we made it clear how many guests we even plan to invite. Everything is still being prepared as it is mostly the two of us paying for the wedding and doing all the organizing. 


Last night my mom called me to lay a major guilt trip on me that my brother (38M) is apparently ‘devastated’ that he is not one of my groomsmen. The thing with my brother is that we are not super close. We are by no means distant, but I probably only see him once every couple of months. Growing up, he was not a good brother. He beat on me quite a bit- more than normal brotherly fighting. He used to make fun of me in front of his friends, exclude me from his life, and was generally unpleasant to be around as a child. He got married young and had a daughter with his then wife and was basically out of my life altogether for years. Over the last few years or so he has made more of an effort to be a part of my life. I think this is mostly due to him being out of work, divorced, and not having too many friends left. He made some bad choices with relationships over the last few years and I think he’s feeling alone in life. I feel for him, but I am not sure what more I can do. I am trying to maintain relationships with my existing friends, build my career, establish a life with my soon to be wife, and grow new bonds with my soon to be in-laws. It’s not easy to increase someone’s presence in your life as you are trying to build your own.


We decided on our wedding party based on the advice of many of our married friends. Everyone said that our wedding party should be people that are part of our daily lives- i.e. our closest friends. I wanted to include my brother at some level in the wedding, so we were going to add him and his daughter as ushers- we just haven’t let them know yet. When my mom called last night, she made it sound like my entire family is upset with us that we have not included my brother as a groomsman. She said people are talking about it and that it is very poor form to not have your brother in the party. I can do an entirely separate post all about my mom, but I will include her reasoning for trying to get me to change my wedding party: “It’s not just your wedding, it’s OUR wedding too.” 


In the end, my fiancé and I will make the decisions we want about our wedding. I guess I am just looking for some input to see if I made a mistake not including my brother as a groomsman. What do you think?


TL:DR- My mom is mad that my brother is not one of my groomsmen and apparently so are a lot of my family."
36,"I (M27) went on a first date last night (F30). We got on well, but I think she and my housemate (M27) would be perfect for each other.


Is it reasonable to suggest to her that they should go out for a drink?  


I get a strong impression she likes me and she told me she had a great time. She's messaged me a couple times since the date. I like her too, but I honestly think that her and my housemate would be a better match. They have more in common, and personality wise I see them being more compatible. They both live for reading (I seldom read), they both like watching anime (I don't), they both love dark themes, they both like 80's music, they both are super intelligent (more so than me), they both need time to themselves (I always wanna be out hanging with people).   


Amongst these feelings, this is the first date I've been on since my last relationship ended, and I realised that I need a little more time before I can invest in someone else.  


How do you guys think I should approach the topic? I've already told my housemate about her and he was very intrigued. I absolutely hate the idea of hurting peoples feelings.

I screamed out of surprise and told him. He said that he’s had them for a couple weeks now he’s just waiting on an exterminator to come and fix the problem.  It’s been a while and an exterminator still hasn’t come. He’s mad that I don’t want to go over to his place but now I suspect that what I was eating—rats and roaches have crawled over.  I Feel sick to my stomach.  Told him I’m not coming back to his house until he gets the infestation stored it out. He called me and told me I’m a horrible person and that his infestation shouldn’t affect the way I see him. Well it does, he didn’t say anything about it for weeks and now expects me to be fine? I’ve been using his plates, cups, eating his food, etc. And he’s not the best at cleaning up after himself. I noticed there were also some roaches that come through his apartment window. How do I either dump him for being nasty, or should I convince him to stay with me until his place is clean?

39,"I (34 F) unfollowed my sister-in-law (31 F) on Instagram and now the whole family is upset


I barely know my sister in law, partially because she and my brother lived abroad for most fo their relationship, and partially because I don't think we like each other very much. This dislike is pretty mild -- like, I don't mind that she's with my brother and I don't think she's a bad person, but we wouldn't be friends if we met in the wild. She's pretty distant around me when we're at the same event, which is fine, but her polite, icy veneer suggests to me that she also doesn't care too much for me and thinks family outings are a chore. That's ok -- I only mention this to show that I don't think she's eager for my friendship while I'm freezing her out or anything. We live in the same city, but have never hung out one-on-one and barely see each other.

So, sometimes Instagram's algorithm fucks you and when you really want puppy memes, you get 80 pics of your sister in law's hands wrapped around a latte, or whatever. Or your colleague's oatmeal-smeared baby. You know -- just a saturation of something you don't feel like looking at for whatever reason. Sometimes I delete people from my feed and then re-add them when they pop up again in suggested friends. Sometimes I delete my whole app and actually go outside for weeks at a time!

Readers: I deleted my sister-in-law. I've done it before. Whatever. Except she installed a tracker, and in came the DM ""Hey, did u unfollow me?"" Oh no. I feel like it would be mean to tell the truth -- that yeah, I delete my feed sometimes and it's usually a victimless crime and in any event, why should one 30-something near-stranger care very much about exactly how many vacation pics another 30-something near-stranger likes, unless the former is petty and insane? So I lied and said ""No, I don't think so, why‽"" At this point I'm regretting ever firing up a modem and www-ing my way onto the inter webs, but I thought maybe she would just shrug it off and then I could re-add her and lesson learned.

She texted me and insisted on meeting up with me in person (something we'd never done in the years we've been ""related""!) and when I told her I was out but she could meet me where I was if she wanted to hang, she called me and told me she took this very seriously and was extremely hurt. I went all-in on the denial strategy (but was nice and empathetic and said I'd go ""check and see what happened"") desperately wishing I were either an only child, or maybe just much less of an idiot, and then it was over. She said it was important to her that we be friends (‽) and asked if we could hang out and I was amenable and even offered some dates (she didn't actually nail anything down, of course, because we never hang out).

My aunt (56 F) is getting on a plane for what will only be the second time in her life this week to come and visit. My brother and his wife are refusing to join the dinner, and my mother (57F) is refusing to host the dinner if they aren't there. HOW IS THIS HAPPENING!

So, I'm just asking for a gut check here, I guess? Like, believe me, I wish to Beyonce Herself that I had never unfollowed her. I wouldn't have done it if I had thought she would find out, because I knew that probably wouldn't feel great for her, but also if she somehow DID find out, I didn't think it would be this serious. Like, I thought that worst case scenario she might tell my brother ""Your sister unfollowed me, she's such a fickle bitch"" and that would be that. And then, when it all went sideways, I wish I had said ""Yes, i unfollowed you but I didn't think you'd mind so much,"" but I was trying to help her save face because I didn't want to call attention to how ridiculous she was being because we're kind of strangers and I figured sometimes polite trumps truth. I REGRET MY ACTIONS, OK?! But also, WHAT THE HOLY HELL! 

Question: Am I out of my mind? Can I just ignore this all now? Would anything possibly help this batshit crazy scenario?

TL;DR I unfollowed my sister-in-law who I barely know on instagram, she found out and was mad at me, so I tried to white lie about it because I thought that was more polite than saying that she cared so much about my following her instagram and I don't really care about her, and now she, my brother, and my mother are all super mad at me and I feel like I'm back in middle school but we're all over 30."
40,"Wife (29F) ""needs"" to have phone, computer, or other distraction during date nights with me (28M)


My wife and I are starting up weekly date nights (due to a feeling of distance we've felt between us), and I posed the rules of no TV, no phones, and no computers. She said that would be ""REEEAAALLY hard"" for her because she ""feels less restless when I have a secondary focus to drown out the other million focuses"".

My initial reaction is frustration, because I feel like I'm not getting her full attention, which is one of the main reasons for having date night. But I'm wondering if she feels restless without her phone because she's just conditioned to having her phone (in which case she could be unconditioned), or because there's some sort of attention deficit component.

41,"I [25F] am going to move out from our apartment before my boyfriend[30M] is back from his vacation.


Hi everyone,

I am a 25 years old engineer. I have a relationship a bit more than a year with my boyfriend, and we are living together for 4 months. He is also an engineer, and I think our interests and hobbies fit perfectly. I love him a lot, and I really want to build a future together with him. He says that he also loves me. But I believe our love definitions are not the same. I feel like he doesn’t want to spend time with me. 
Couple of months ago I asked him multiple times to play tennis together. He has issues with his wrists and his knees time to time. So he always declined my offer(btw he is going to gym 4 times in a week). But later, I found out he played tennis with his friends and he really liked it and now he wants to play more.
He never arranges date to go out for us. I try to plan some dates for us, but when I am doing it I am scared that he is not going to like it. He has always plans for doing something with other people, just not with me. He says he likes to eat dinner and watch tv shows with me. I don’t want to be just that. I want to be more for him. 
I recently started to notice that whenever we go out he checks out the hot girls around. He never misses one of them. I am a girl who cares about my appearance, I don’t think I am an ugly woman. But why my boyfriend always looks at the other girls around. I am not talking about just one look. He catches eye contact and keep doing it, and at that time If I talk about something, he doesn’t listen me. I feel so disconnected at those times.
I am not psychologically doing good when my boyfriend makes me feel invaluable. He says he loves me, but I feel like I am just a nice girl who has a good job in the same field as his. I don’t think he loves me because who I am. I feel sad. :(
Our sex life used to be so good, but now I am always the one who initiates the sex. Usually he is tired or not in the mood. Maybe he is not attracted to me anymore. I am loosing my self confidence day by day.
We planned a vacation together for a week. We said let’s not decide where to go, we will look for the cheapest plane ticket and we will go there. And then, In couple of days later he said he is going on a vacation with his friend to somewhere far away for a week. I felt like invisible when he said that. He just cancelled our trip, and decided to go on a vacation with someone else. I told him I am not happy what he did and this is going to effect our relationship in a bad way. But it didn’t change the result, he is on vacation now.
I want to be with a person that I can discover the world together, doing fun activities together, share my happy sad days together. I want him to be my best friend. He is my best friend. But I am definitely not his best friend..

I am planning to move out from our apartment this week. He is not going to find me when he is back from his vacation. I am just too nervous, wanted to share with you guys.  

TL;DR
***My boyfriend cancelled our vacation plans and went on a vacation with a friend. He doesn’t like to spend time with me in general. I need somebody to tell me “find your way”***"
42,"I [23 F] am so burnt out from dealing with creepy guys. I'm scared I'm going to do something drastic.






I also recently found out that 4 of my girl friends were uncomfortable around a guy in our social circle who had been pushy towards all of them while drinking. I took it on myself to tell a couple people that the 5 of us would no longer be coming to events that person was at. That ended up working out for us, people stipped inviting him once they knew the situation.

One of my best friends just told me someone had sex with her when she was too drunk to consent, like basically incoherently drunk and not fully aware of what was going on. I tried to help by getting her a pregnancy test and info about std testing, but I still feel so helpless in general. 

Whenever I'm out with my friends, and someone gets creepy with one of them, I'm usually the one who has to step in and tell them to back off. Because most of my friends are a little more worried about causing a scene. It's happened a lot.

-----

And overall, I'm just fed up. I feel so drained. It's like I'm playing a fucking game of whack-a-mole, I deal with one person and another pops up very soon after. I don't want this to be the rest of my life, but I feel powerless to stop it. 

I've noticed myself getting more and more unwilling to tolerate this kinda shit. At first, that was a good thing, standing up for myself and my friends more. But I'm scared someday I'm going to take it too far and get myself in trouble. I'm so angry with all these experiences building up. I have a lot of shame that I was too scared or powerless to stand up for myself or my friends soon enough, or effectively enough. And I'm scared that the next time something like that happens, I'm going to overreact and make a big mistake. 

Not too long ago, I came very close to smashing a glass bottle over the head of one of these people. And I only held back at the last minute because I thought of the legal consequences. But the idea of hurting him, if the law wasn't a thing, didn't bother me, or scare me. And knowing that about myself does scare me. But I'm worried that with all this anger building up, especially anger at people who have hurt my friends, I'm going to do something drastic.

I told one of my friends about this, and he said he didn't see me as someone who would have it in them hurt another person, he said not to worry. But I just don't think he sees that, because I hide it. 

My dad suggested I start learning martial arts, to teach me how to defend myself if I need to, but also teach me discipline and teach me the appropriate time to fight vs walk away. I think I'm going to do that.

I'm also seeing a therapist, I I'm going to bring this up to her.

But I'm still just feeling so burnt out, and exhausted, and helpless. And I don't know how to change that. 

Has anyone experienced something similar? How did you deal with it?

How can I protect myself and my friends without always feeling so exhausted and burnt out and angry?

TLDR - I'm just so fed up with dealing with creeps, I've seen some bad stuff in my own life, and from friends. I don't know how to get past it mentally.

43,"My [27F] husband [32M] doesn't want to help me with anything at all and gets really angry whenever I ask him for help or if I confront him about it.


My husband has always been helpful towards his friends, offering to buy things online on their behalf or helping out when needed but he's not like that with me. 

Recently, I put some of my clothing in the washing machine intending to wash them at night when I'm home. When I came home, he told me he did the laundry already, but only his own laundry. He actually took out my clothes specifically from the washing machine and washed only his. When I confronted him, he said that it's because he felt that it's MY clothes and thus I should wash them myself. But we're married.. is there a need to be so calculative? I've always helped him wash his clothes if i happen to see it lying around. I told him this and he said ""then don't wash my clothes in the future even if you see it lying around"". But I feel that it's only right for a married couple to help each other out right?

I usually wash my utensils right after I've used them but the few times that I've left a bowl in the sink, he wouldn't wash it for me. His theory is that it's mine and thus I should do it myself. I don't understand why he can be so helpful to his friends and relatives yet so calculating towards me. 

Another incident was when I was in the toilet and forgot to refill the toilet paper. When I shouted for him to help me take some toilet paper he actually refused to and said that I should have made sure there was toilet paper before using the toilet and he was really angry that I asked for his help. I'm really bewildered by his actions. 

I've actually confronted him before but he gets very defensive and he feels that I'm spoiled (I've had people helping me with chores before moving in with him) and thus he doesn't want to help me with any chores. But I always done my own chores in this new house, and I'm not expecting him to do my chores for me. I just want him to help me whenever I need help, or not be so calculative towards me and think that I'm out to take advantage of him. 

I've told him that I'm very hurt by his actions and I feel like we're roommates instead of a married couple. When I point out that I've washed his stuff whenever I see it lying around, he denies it and says that he has never seen me doing it. Why would I lie about helping him? 

I get that perhaps he thinks I'm spoilt and thus need ""lessons"" but I get really hurt by it and I'm really trying to help out around the house and do chores. The thing is if he already has such a perception of me, everything I do will only serve to reinforce this perception. For example, I can wash my dishes ten times but the one time I leave my cup around he will think ""yup, she's being spoilt or entitled again, expecting me to help her"" when I'm not. 

Going off tangent for a bit but he also never ever asks me out unless I explicitly tell him to, and though he knows that I like flowers and gifts he never buys them for me of his own accord (I have to specifically tell him and remind him to buy them for me for my birthday so I don't get upset). It makes me feel so unloved, like I'm not deserving of any gifts or pampering and it really upsets me. I've pointed it out to him many times but it doesn't seem like he's making an effort to change. 

I don't know if this is something that'll get better with time and I'm at my wits end. I just feel so unloved and I feel that this is so unhealthy for a marriage. And I'm worried that it'll only get worse after we have kids (we're planning to conceive in a year or two). I've been struggling with anxiety for a while now and this is not helping at all. 

Tl;dr Husband wants to draw a line with chores and doesn't want to help me with anything around the house. "
44,"Did my [22/f] boyfriend [22/m] try to cheat on me with my best friend [22/] bizzare conversation


I’m confused about exactly what happened, I told my boyfriend I was going to watch some tv but I fell asleep. He then panicked when I didn’t reply several hours later. So he messaged my best friend, but instead of asking her if I was okay, he asked if she wanted to spend time with him, and why she hasn’t replied. The conversation then continued like this

Best friend: what about x?
Boyfriend: who is x??
Best friend: is this a joke? X is your girlfriend
Boyfriend: how do you know x??
Bestfriend: are you joking? She is my best friend
Boyfriend: please I made a mistake, you mustn’t tell her
I only messaged you because I was worried x didn’t reply to me.

Now absolutely nothing makes sense to me. If he was worried about me then he should have started the conversation asking her if I was okay. The most confusing part is despite talking to her many times he doesn’t seem to remember she is my best friend and when he realises the mistake he begs her not to mention. But how could he have forgotten she is my best friend? I figured he was talking to so many girls he couldn’t remember who she was. 

The thing is, normally I’d break things off straight away, but my boyfriend is usually a lovely caring person and I just can’t understand what happened. English isn’t his first language so he claims it’s a misunderstanding but I’m not sure what to believe.

TLDR boyfriend sent strange messages to best friend, was he going to cheat on me."
45,"I [M 26] need advice on how to handle getting chlamydia from my GF [F 24] of 7+ years


Hi all,

I have a lot of stuff going on in my life right now, and I just got this bombshell of news.  My girlfriend of almost 8 years called me on Friday morning, frantically asking if I was sleeping around.  I say no (which is the truth) and she then says she tested positive for chlamydia during her routine checkup at the OBGYN.  I soon realize that I have it too, which explains the slight discomfort I've had while peeing the past month and a half.

So I go to the clinic, test positive and get treated.  It sucks, but I'm more concerned about the repercussions to our relationship.  She is my first, and I'm her first, so we can rule out the possibility of it coming from a previous partner.

In a situation full of uncertainty, the one thing I know for sure is that I have not put my self in any situation to get chlamydia from anyone else.  She has not accused me on cheating except for the initial phone call.  We talked later that night and she promises me that she didn't cheat on me.  Once or twice a month, she'll go out with friends and drink.  She claims that she's never been in a situation where she's not around her friends where she could've been taken advantage of.  She also is home at a reasonable time too, so it's not like she's going out and not coming home.  The only time she started crying during this talk, is when she said she's terrified of losing me over a false accusation.

One of the best parts of my GF has been her loyalty.  We've had our share of issues during our relationship, but never had any suspicions of infidelity.  We made it thru the dramatic HS and college days fine, but now we have this huge issue to work through.  She regularly compliments my man parts, talks about marriage &amp; family, and has no history of cheating.  

She knows I'm skeptical, and knows that I don't think she caught it by using a porta-potty or trying on a bikini (two scenarios she has suggested).  She actually has been very nice throughout this time, while I've been more distant and skeptical.  I just really don't know how to move on from this.  If she did cheat on me, I'd break up with her in a heartbeat and move.  

This is such a shitty thing to happen because I don't know if I should risk 8 years of a happy relationship (and probably the person I'll marry) over something I'll never fully be able to prove.  It also doesn't help that I live with her.

Any help with how I should handle things is greatly appreciated.

TL/DR

\- Girlfriend says she has chlamydia, I test positive too

\- I have not put myself in any situation to get it from someone else

\- GF and I have a history of faithfulness and claims to have not cheated

\- GF hasn't accused me, and thinks she contracted it in a non-sexual way

\- OP has no clue what to do"
46,"My (28m) fiancé (24f) constantly mentioning her ""the one that got away"" and it makes me jealous


It's late so I apologize for any errors and I will keep this as short as possible. Also apologize if the title isn't right or doesn't make sense. 

I met April and we immediately had a connection, and such amazing chemistry.. I knew I'd fall for her quick.

When we met, she'd been kind of freshly single, and had broken up with her boyfriend of almost a year 2 months prior. 

We are engaged and have a wedding planned for fall, but lately I'm questioning our relationship a bit. 

The guy she was with previously was her first serious relationship, and he broke up with her. He had cheated countless times, was a serial liar but she wanted him anyway.  She's told my stories and they sound insane and I don't know why she stayed as long as she did. 

She *constantly* talks about this guy. And she talks about him like he's the most amazing person on the planet. 

We got into an argument about it about 2 months ago.. She's stopped talking about him to me, but is actively talking about him to friends and she's still looking him up on social media. 

Ive read texts where she's gone on and on about how amazing he is, he's the most perfect guy in the world, she'll never love anyone as much as she loved him, he's perfect, etc. And she's mentioned that she'd get back with him immediately if he wanted. 

We've fought over this, we've had calm CL conversations, but nothing changes. Her argument is always ""everyone has someone they regret losing. Someone they love forever even if they aren't there. Someone they'd drop anyone to be with again."" but I don't have that at all.. And none of my friends are obsessed with an ex? 

I'm just not sure how to handle this. I saw just 3 days ago she was looking him up on IG and it makes my heart just sink. I don't feel good enough and I feel like she will forever compare me to him. Or I'm a placeholder. I don't know. Any advice? 

Tl;dr; fiancé always talking about her ex and says she'd be with him if he asked. We're about to be married but this is making me question our relationship and worry"
47,"My (F25) husband (M25) came out to me as bisexual


First - I DO NOT think bisexual = infidelity. I'm NOT concerned about fidelity.

My husband just admitted to me he has found himself wanting some of his male coworkers sexually. He has only had female sexual partners. In our dating life, he, imo, projected how he thought sexually submissive men were ""weak"". In our engagement he became open to prostate stimulation and craving kinky submissive sex. Now that we are married, he gets genuinely more excitement from pegging and blowjobs. 

I asked him gentle questions to better understand him. I can tell he finds me a safe haven to open up with so I don't want to ruin that by saying something that could make him feel ashamed. However, I have no one to process this with. I'm confused and kind of hurt by this exchange:

Me: Could you be happy without vagina?

Him: I could be ok if I never got vagina and you only pegged me and gave oral

Me: Do you think that's because you want more focused attention on you?

Him: If you had a penis and no vagina, I could live with that as long as I could still do anal on you.

So I now feel mixed up. I feel a little mislead. I feel sort of not appreciated (?) sexually, which hurts me the most because sexual intimacy is a big deal for me especially since he's my one and only. I understand I fell in love with him for him and someone's sexuality really has no bearing on another person - it's the choices we make that do. I've been feeling put off by how much more he wants what I don't naturally have to offer. I'd appreciate if anyone could help me name what I'm actually upset about and if anyone could share their similar experience.

\*\*Tl:Dr\*\* My husband came out to me as sexually attracted to men and I'm a little mixed up inside."
48,"My (27/F) boyfriend (28/M) of two years has been acting really suspicious on his trip with friends.


We travel a lot for work, together and with friends. 

Usually we text and call before bed. 

On this current trip, my boyfriend has only texted me a few times in the space of three days and he missed the call that we scheduled for the second night. 

I’ve never felt that he would cheat on me. But a few of my friends are saying things like this usually come to light two years in. One person in the relationship gets too comfortable and you either grow together or you grow apart. 

At first I was just worried but he sent me a quick text the following morning to let me know that he had just fallen asleep early. They’re staying in a cabin, doing a bunch of hiking and outdoor activities during the day so it’s completely possible that he had tired himself out and forgot to call. I didn’t think anything of it but then I noticed on IG that one of his friends posted a photo from the previous night that was taken at some sort of pub with a bunch of random girls hanging all over them. My boyfriend was looking away from the camera so might not have known that his photo was taken. He didn’t mention going to a pub to me, and he definitely didn’t mention any girls. 

I did some clicking around and found the IG of one of those girls. Not the one who was practically sitting on his lap. A different one. She posted some more photos from that night, in which my boyfriend and this other girl were *really* close. They weren’t kissing or doing anything overtly sexual, but her ass was hanging out and she was giving him fuck eyes for sure. His focus was on that girl in every photo from multiple IG’s. It was like they couldn’t see anyone else around them. 

I immediately asked my boyfriend to explain and he’s basically ignored me since then. Maybe I’m stupid but I thought we were good together before he left. I had no concerns. He’s allowed to talk to and hang out with whoever he wants. That’s not my concern. It’s when I see multiple photos of him where a random girl is on his lap and touching his leg and squeezing her chest together inches away from his face. All on the same night that he said he “fell asleep early”.

We live together. He’s met my family. I’ve met his. 

I don’t know what to think at this point. Not once in our relationship has he left me hanging like this. He didn’t even bother to tell me that it wasn’t true and that those photos were just photos. He just said, “It looks bad,” and hasn’t said anything since. I’m not sure what he expects me to think, but in my mind he either cheated on me or got really close to cheating on me. He knows that I know and now he’s just trying to figure out a way to explain the photos. 

This is so fucked up. I don’t know what to do. I only asked him to explain the photos to me twice. Now it’s his job to reach out, but he doesn’t appear to want to because he clearly did something wrong. Even if it’s just what was in the photos. 

Suggestions? Thoughts? 

**tl;dr** I saw photos of him with a random girl on his lap and giving him fuck eyes on a friend’s IG. He said he fell asleep early that night. Now that I’ve asked him to explain the photos, he hasn’t said a word. 
"
49,"My (F/27) boyfriend (M/28) of 4 years is an aspiring author, but won't get a job in the meantime.


We met in graduate school. I had a job lined up post-graduation. He decided now that he had finished school, he wanted to use his time to focus on his writing. That soon became his plan for the future, he wants to be a successful novelist and is working on his first book. 

Because of that he says the book effectively is his job right now, and so he doesn't have to apply anywhere. He says ""Just because I'm not going to a place where I do work for someone who gives me money doesn't mean I'm not working."" 

I understand that, I'm glad he's so motivated to pursue his dream. But, it doesn't change the fact that until that dream becomes real, we still have expenses that I can't cover completely on my own salary. 

To this he suggested we just use a credit card...he'd rather pay off debt in the future than have a job right now. Sorry but that's just a bad idea.

I'm increasingly unhappy with this. Things have been more and more stressful between us recently because of the job issue. If he worked even part time it would help and he'd still have plenty of time to write! He doesn't believe this. He's unwilling to look for a job, let alone work at one, because he insists the whole day should be used for writing. He's very intense about it.

Again, I know how serious he is about this goal, and I think that's great! But! -- how can I get him to see that employment in the meantime is just a financial necessity, not something I'm asking because I don't support him?

Tl;dr: My boyfriend refuses to get a job while working on his first novel. He only wants his career to be writing. I really want him to have a job because it's really hard to budget everything on just my salary. Also, and I haven't said this, but if his book doesn't end up getting published he will definitely need to have something else in place."
50,"I (20f) forgot to disconnect my phone from car's bluetooth during conversation with boyfriend (21m)


A few days ago, I went out with a group of friends for dinner. The day before, my boyfriend agreed to go, but on the day of, he couldn't make it in time, which was fine. After dinner, we decided to drive to this place where you could see the stars and one of his friends called him to ask if he wanted to come with us. He said no and his friend then asked me to call him and convince him to go. He immediately got angry with me and told me to fuck off. There was a long silence and then he hung up. He didn't realize that my phone was connected to the car's speakers by bluetooth and that everyone had heard what he said. When I told him this the day after, he became angry and borderline violent because it made him look bad. I can understand his anger but a few years ago, I was in Mexico with a friend and got super drunk. I called him and was an emotional wreck and we ended up fighting. I later learned that he was in a  group call with his friends at the time and that he had intentionally put our conversation on speaker because he thought it would be funny. This probably doesn't justify my actions and I didn't want to bring this up because it would probably further anger him.

Was I wrong in this situation? What can I do to make it right? 

TL;DR  forgot to disconnect my phone from the car's speakers during conversation with boyfriend, he told me to fuck off, and got mad when I told him about the situation the day after"
51,"My [28M] future stepdaughter[F13] has been telling her friends I'm her boyfriend and is overly friendly and attached to me; how do I fix this gently with minimal emotional collateral?


**Mandatory Background Info:** I am a very short and small Asian man (5'3, \~96lbs). I am both tiny and baby-faced and the approximate size of a middleschooler. That's just the lot I rolled in life. I'm engaged to and have been dating (let's call her \[F13\]) Brandi's *father* \[M49\] for five years. Brandi is a sweet girl but an ugly duckling with a twin sister who is already a swan. Brandi's sister, much to everyone's chagrin, always has boys paying attention to her. I've been trying to boost Brandi's self-esteem and spending extra time with her and she's developed a little crush on me.

\----------------------------

I dropped Brandi off for her practice today on and discovered that she's been passing me off as her high school age boyfriend. I pick her up and drop her off almost every day when her dad can't and I'm a familiar face with most of the teachers and most parents. Normally I'd brush it off because it's a silly thing and kids do that sort of stuff while trying to impress their peers and whatnot. When I dropped her off, I noticed that some of the other parents were talking to the lead camp admin and pointing me out. 

The short story is Brandi has been prolifically spreading around that I'm her boyfriend to the other kids and some parents caught wind of it and were disturbed that a 13 year old was 'dating' a kid who had to be at least 16. I cleared the air of that misconception from the parents immediately and am still upset and perturbed. What I'm more worried about is Brandi. I've been talking it over with the girls' father and he was more bemused than anything else and says it's a phase that will die out. Be that as it may, I don't appreciate this position I'm in.

How do I best start those conversations with not only Brandi but her dad? I don't want to wait for her crush to die out because I'd rather nip it in the bud. Her father thinks it's funny and kind of cute but not a serious situation in the least. I don't think he realizes that due to the way I look, people actually believe at first sight that I could be Brandi's boyfriend. It's stressful to me, but something I can easily dispel *as an almost 30 year old man who you can tell is clearly not 16 when I talk*. I want to help Brandi out because I know a lot of this situation spawned from jealousy over her sister's social graces and from me bending over backwards to bolster her up because I know how it feels to be in her position; I was the duckling too. Still am, but was then also. 

How can I drive the point home without attacking her or making her feel like me offering encouragement and trying to help her out is anything more than that? She's (apparently ???) been taking my ""Hey you did really great today!/I'm proud of you/You're awesome at that"" type comments and willingness to talk and listen to her as something more than a parental figure wanting to be involved in her life and caring about her well-being and happiness. 

Any advice on how to best navigate these waters would be appreciated.

**Tl;Dr:** Future stepdaughter is emotionally attached to me because I encourage her to do her best and pay attention to her and spread it around her peer group and beyond that I was her boyfriend. I'm a super tiny person, parents of the kids believed it, but I cleared that situation yet need help on how to talk to Brandi about how that's not acceptable without botching her self-esteem and the rapport that's being established?"
52,"My boyfriend [24 M] is really rude about my [25 F] business trips, calling them my ""Instagram Vacations""



I do government contracted engineering work, city infrastructure related stuff. Most of our customers are outside the US. And it's crazy how much money gets thrown around in my business, especially when corruption comes into play. Some of the governments we work with are the type where bribery and horrible mismanagement of tax money is the norm. 

I travel a lot for work, and basically everyone who travels for my company gets travel finance approvals for fancy hotels, rented luxury cars, meals at nice places, expensive last minute flights, whatever. All paid by the customer. It was a huge culture shock when I started here, I grew up pretty broke. So my boss encouraging me to rent luxury sports cars for a business trip, when I'm still driving my 15 year old rust bucket at home? Or encouraging me to eat at the fanciest places when traveling, when I'm usually eating pasta or hot dogs at home? Bizarre. 

It's been really nice seeing the world for free, even though it's just weekends of sightseeing sandwiched by weeks of hard work.

My boyfriend keeps criticizing me harshly, when I talk about work. Like if I mention renting a fancy car, or a hotel having perks. He gets jealous I'm off ""on my Instagram vacation"" 

I've told him that my job is hard work, they're not sending me on vacation. And yeah, I do take pictures of the cool stuff I see, or cool cars my coworkers and I rent, for Instagram, but honestly sightseeing is not the point of my trips. I also never take or post work related photos on social media because of confidentiality agreements. But he's always acting snippy about me doing anything excessive. Or snippy about me having a day or two to sightsee each week. Or posting pictures from my trips on Instagram.

I told him that travel can often be exhausting work. Days spent in airports and on planes. Working with customers, often times having to communicate difficult technical concepts through a language barrier. Weeks spent on industrial sites, with long hours each day, all the research and preparation before each trip. Staying up late at night on the computer, working in the hotel, just to wake up the next day and do it again.

To that, he always says stuff like ""I work hard too, I work long hours, but you don't see me driving around in a hundred thousand dollar car afterwards. 

I feel like he's jealous, without understanding all the work that goes into my job. I busted my ass during college, and throughout my career. It's not been easy or fun, and not felt like a vacation at all.

TLDR - My boyfriend is really jealous and nitpicky about the luxuries I enjoy on business trips. He doesn't seem to understand how hard I work, and that it's not all some ""Instagram vacation"" "
53,"My mom (60) gave three family heirlooms (rings) to my sister (29) and nothing to me (32). Feeling left out of some family memories and not sure if it's worth bringing up


I have one sibling -- a younger sister (29). For years, my sister struggled with school and in her personal life, and in a (what I believe) was a misguided attempt to help, my parents babied her big time. They moved her into an apartment while she was in school and paid her rent/expenses. Meanwhile, I couldn’t move out until I was 22 and could afford rent/all my expenses on my own or with roommates. Today I have a good job, and although I'm not well off by any stretch, I'm doing pretty good for myself. 

My sister finished school last year and now also has a good job. One that if she really applies herself, she could make more than I do. However, I recently learned something and I'm not sure how to feel about it.

For years, my mom always said that Sarah would get my great-grandmother's engagement ring. This thing is a serious rock. It's beautiful, with several huge diamonds. Fine by me -- It's not quite my style and my mom said that she believed the ""types of guys"" my sister dated would never be able to give her anything like it. I always thought that the latter was a weird reason (and a big assumption) but the former reason making sense -- It's maybe not something I'd appreciate as much as she would).

Fine, totally fine. However, now, I was at my sister's last week and she ended up showing me two more rings -- one from the same grandmother, and another from our other grandmother -- that my mother also gave to her. Now, one of those rings I always loved -- it's more of a vintage-looking band and I always assumed it was probably costume jewelry, but my sister told me she had it appraised just to see, and it's actually very much a real gold band with real diamonds. The other ring is a gold band my other grandmother used to always wear. That one is a little strange to me that my mother would have given it away, as it was her mother's and the only thing she had of her mother's (one of my aunts wiped out my grandmother's place when she died).

I really don't know how to feel here. The not-as-important factor here is the fact that my sister now has or will every valuable family heirloom from both our grandmothers, and the main factor is that my mother seems to have left me out of all of these discussions/isn't setting any heirlooms aside for me. I don't know how to bring it up to her either, because she's super sensitive/nonconfrontational and will either try immediately to say she didn't mean Sarah could keep them forever/she didn't mean to/Sarah just asked for them so she didn't know what to do/I'm so independent and Sarah is not so she'll never be able to buy something like that for herself. IDK…I feel kind of hurt, but also like maybe I'll need to just let it go. Thoughts? Should I try to bring up? I really would hate if my mom thought I was fishing for valuables or something. 

$%\^&amp;\*()&amp;$%\^&amp;\*()

TLDR: Found out my mom gave my sister two valuable rings/family heirlooms and has another set aside for her for down the road. To my knowledge, there isn't anything set aside for me and I feel like I've been left out of having any piece of family memories. Should I let it go or bring it up to my very sensitive mother? "
54,"I [26M] am very close to obtaining a Title in Chess, but my SO [26F] thinks I should quit the game.


We have only been together for roughly two months, and during that time I have played chess 3 hours every Monday, Thursday and Sunday. I attend medical school, and am generally a busy man. We see eachother 2-3 times a week, mostly for dinner and sleepover, and every sunday for a walk in a forest nearby.

For those of you who play/watch/know chess, to obtain a title there are certain requirements, many (if not all) of which requires you to attend international, or atleast national, tournaments.

Chess has been a huge part of my life as a kid, and in my teens my interest in becoming a Grandmaster declined, as I realised just how much work that would be for me. I decided that I would practice it as a hobby, and perhaps in the future try for a title.

I am now in the fortunate situation that my rating is just below the requirements for a FIDE Master title. The next 3 months are the only months in which I can attend tournaments due to my busy schedule. I therefore wanted to spend more, like.. 3-5 hours a day studying and preparing.

I told my SO about this, and her reaction was very mixed. She said that she always thought me playing chess was kind of cute, but she would prefer that I had a different hobby. I could not understand this. I asked if this was because she was bummed out that I would have less time in the 3 month break from school, this was not the case.

I am the regional master, but have not won the National championship. She thinks I should be happy with what I have achieved, and spend my time on more productive things. When I asked what, she said school - but I have nothing but A's and B's for grades, and I already spend a lot of time reading.

She never gave me an ultimatum, but she strongly implied that the more chess I played, the less interested she would be in me. She claims this has nothing to do with her finding chess boring, me having less time to see her or the fact that Chess is not 'cool'. She refuses to give me an actual reason, other than 'It's not worthwhile.'

I feel like I have to choose between her and finally getting a title, but most importantly, I don't know if I could ever give up chess without a proper reason. She refuses to talk about this matter any more, and I am unsure as to what my next move should be.

Kind regards.

\[TL;DR\] My girlfriend implied that the more chess I play, the less she would be interested in me. She won't give me a reason, and I had planned to spend more time playing chess during my break from studies.

EDIT: Forgot to mention that my father spent hours on hours teaching me Chess as a kid, with the hope that I could one day achieve a Grandmaster title. He himself loves the game, but started playing in his 30's, and never got too far. When I told him that I wanted to spend less time on Chess, he said 'You are now old enough to make your own decisions, and I only ever wanted you to earn a title because you and I would have even more reason to spend time together.' I always found this response to be very admirable, and I kind of want to surprise him, as I am sure he would still be very happy we made it."
55,"I (20/F) just made my Grandmother (77/F) cry and I don’t feel that I am in the wrong.


I still live at home with my mom (50/F) and sisters (16/F and 18/F) but I am saving up to move out in 6 months to a year. I don’t drive because I have epilepsy and my mom informed me that  my sister (18/F) had a doctors appointment that my grandmother would be taking us to. My grandmother is also insistent that she goes with us inside the doctors office, and we allow her to do so, which now that I think about it is a terrible idea. My grandmother and I don’t really get along because we are two very different people. She has made comments about my weight in the past and when I told her that she hurt my feelings instead she said “So I can’t say anything that’s true?,” and got upset with me. 

 When I was in the sixth grade I was failing math class and I was taken to class early to see what I could do to fix my grade. I was upset and began to cry and she went to hug me. I refused to hug her and instead of letting it go she continued to attempt to hug me. She went to my mom, who when she got home from work gave me a spanking and forced me to write an apology note. She is also incredibly judgemental and slightly homophobic. 

 Today at the doctors appointment whenever I talked to my doctor she would give me this look that meant she thought I was lying, which upset and annoyed me. She also added on to my statements and said things that I would have rather kept private. After we left the doctors office she noticed that I was annoyed and told me to stop being annoyed. I told her that in a year I would be able to legally drink and that I able to vote and that I felt like she was being condescending. After that she got mad and I told her that from now on I would catch the bus or Uber to appointments. After we were in the car I noticed she was crying. Instead of feeling bad I felt annoyed. My mom has also had the same experiences. My mom once told her to stop looking at her bank account and my grandmother started crying. Am I in the wrong?

TL;DR: I told my grandmother that I felt she was being condescending and she started crying. This is not the first time she has done this and I’m tired of being made the bad guy."
56,"How can I [22 M] confront my mother [50 F] about spending money she owes me on unwanted gifts for me then calling it even.


When I was a teenager I didn't have my own bank account, so my part-time paycheck went into Liquid Gold savings account. These accounts have no debit card and are controlled by your parent so I had to access all my money through my mother.

She would occasionally buy gifts for me and take the money out of my account to pay for them. The final nail in the coffin was when I was 17 and she bought me an iPad that ""would be useful for university"" and took the money from me. I never properly confronted her about it, but set up my own bank account and asked her to transfer all my money to me.

Fast forward to this summer, I went on holiday with my family. I paid for a few things like a family ticket to a theme park because it makes things cheaper when you buy together. Altogether she owed me around £120 for things I spent on her, my younger sibling and my dad.

While we were on holiday I turned down offers to have a cup of instant coffee in the morning, because I don't like instant coffee and only sometimes drink the milky drip coffee they have in shops.

For some reason ""I don't really like instant coffee"" in her brain translates to ""I'm a massive coffee snob"" so she bought me a £120 cappuccino machine so I can drink the coffee ""I like"" at home. She then wanted to call it even for the money I owed.

I will never use this machine, not even once, but when I asked for the receipt to get it returned she said she threw it away, and got angry at me saying I was a ""spoiled little brat"" who's ungrateful for the kindness my mother is offering me.

What would be the best way for me to approach this situation and ask for my money? Or should I just accept the loss and move on seeing what I can sell the machine for? I doubt I'll get more than £30 for it looking at how cheap second hand ones go for on eBay/Facebook.

TL:DR: My mum owed me £120, and instead bought me a coffee machine. When confronted she got angry, can't get a refund and won't pay me."
57,"One of my [25/m] best friends [25/m] got back together with an ex [25/f] who cheated on him repeatedly and I'm having trouble respecting him.


This might be a weird problem to have as it really doesn't affect my day to day life but here goes. 

My friend, John, was with his girlfriend, Joanna, since they were around 15. We were all best friends in high school along with a small group of friends. Over the years some friends dropped off but there were still a few of us left, we would hang out once a week and drink/hang out. John and Joanna got engaged to each other a few years ago, the rest of the group didn't really like Joanna because she always seemed to have one foot out the door, but we were happy for John. 

Last November John called us all and let us know that he and Joanna had broken up because she cheated on him with multiple guys. I can't say I was shocked because she never really seemed trustworthy. What did shock me was when she called me and asked if I wanted to join her for a drink. I turned her down and let John know, turns out she had called our other friends too asking the same question. John was really hurt and we all tried our best to be there for him and help anyway we could. 

Fast forward to last week, John calls us all again and tells us that he's getting back together with Joanna and we should all get together and hang out. Immediately I hate this idea because I really don't respect her as a person after what she did. But after thinking about it for a while, I find myself not respecting John either, why would he get back together with someone who treated him so poorly? 

TLDR: Friend got back together with a cheating ex, expects us all to be friends again. I can't respect him or his decision. Any advice on how to move forward? "
58,"My [M34] brother is 32 years old and on divorce #3. He's already dating a new girl who's 21, and she's pregnant.


Warning: very, very trashy.

With that out of the way:

My brother can't be single. Since he was 14 he's had at least one girlfriend at any given time. Even when he's in these relationships he craves attention from other women. He is a serial cheater. His entire self concept revolves around women validating him, as many as possible.

Currently he's going through his third divorce. Wife #3 has split because she caught him cheating with the 21 year old I mentioned in the title. 

They are BOTH pregnant--his ex-wife and the other girl. He already has a 2 year old son with Wife #3. He's also got a 5 year old son from Wife #2 and daughters ages 8 and 11 from Wife #1. Frankly I wouldn't be surprised if there's a dozen other kids running around out there being raised by single mothers he swept off their feet in a bar some random night and then ghosted. 

This 21 year old girl has dropped out of college to have my brother's baby. As he gets older, the women he chases just get younger. Until this, I thought his most recent ex wife was too young for him at age 25. Now women his own age just won't do anymore. The attention has to be from women a decade younger. 

His social media postings have even changed to appeal to that age group. He's slowly changed the way he types and the things he references. All while he's courting the 21 year old he knocked up, he's on Instagram and Twitter posting shirtless ""muscle"" selfies and flirting with a dozen emojis on college girls' pictures.

He is behind on child support payments to all his baby mama's because he works a minimum wage job with no desire to upgrade. This job is at a seedy strip club as a ""security guard"" (in practice there's a lot less security involved than facilitating backroom activities between strippers and clients, which he takes a cut of, and which is also under the table.) 

Told you this would get trashy.

So, even with that additional income, he has very little left after all his child support payments. He usually blows most of the rest on weed and booze. 

He's currently living with his ""girlfriend"" at her apartment, rent-free. He tells me this is so they can ""start their life together.""

And apparently the girl will soon be working at the strip club too, while pregnant!! That was his solution to his money troubles instead of, I don't know, getting himself a real fucking job!

Anyway, that's mostly all background...

Today he told me he's planning to propose to her sometime this week! They've known each other for all of 3 months. The divorce was only initiated 2 weeks ago. 

I kind of lost it and told him straight out that four marriages, three divorces, and four (at least) baby mama's of six (at least) kids by age 32 is RIDICULOUS. 99% of men die at ripe old ages without ever racking up numbers like that.  

He told me to ""mind my own fucking business"" despite him being the one to call ME for advice on the engagement. He has serious self-esteem issues and needs constant approval from the women he's involved with. He said it would ""destroy him"" if she turned down his proposal, so he needed a romantic way to make her see that he's the one for her, he'll defend his family to the death, hlah blah blah. He acts like a dramatic 15 year old dealing with his first crush.

I don't have time for his bullshit. I would have cut ties long ago if not for all the innocent kids he leaves in his wake, out of a sense of obligation to be a stable adult figure in their lives. But I don't know how much more I can take of trying to mitigate the effects of his behavior on other people.

I ended the call angrier than I'm proud of. Basically told him to grow up, get a normal respectable job that can support a child + all the payments for his other kids including his now-ex wife's, get over the obsession with needing female attention, and be someone these kids can be proud to call their father. 

I'm sick of his drama, I don't understand how he can live like this. I didn't go to his third marriage and word got back to me that he chewed me out in front of everyone there. I dealt with it then and I can deal with it happening this time but I just don't get it. It is simpler and easier NOT to keep getting married only to cheat on them and never visit the kids you father (except when he feels like stirring up shit with their mothers.) 

Why is he like this?

Can I just step out of everything? I'd like to, except for wanting to be there for my nieces and nephews.

Tl;dr: My brother is a mess. Plans on proposing to what will become his fourth wife, a 21 year old he cheated on his third wife with and got pregnant. Is it time to stop telling him how to fix his life when he doesn't seem to care?"
59,"I've stopped trying to initiate with my S.O. of 6 years


The relationship is great outside of the bedroom. We cook together, go on hikes together, play games/watch movies together. We both love EDM and go to music festivals a couple times a year. A couple months back I began to feel like I was pushing for sex a majority of the time (and often being shot down) so I brought it up to her. 

""I'm tired at night, you should try sometime when we are not going to bed"" turned into ""I'm groggy in the morning, you shouldn't expect me to do that when I wake up"" which turned into ""not now, I'm trying to do ____"".

Rinse/repeat this cycle for weeks and I finally got to a point where I would rather take care of business by myself than to put forth an effort. Last time we did anything in the bedroom has been about month ago and I don't even think she has noticed.

This lack of intimacy is stressful and I don't know how to handle it.

**TL;DR** I'd rather ""self serve"" than to initiate sex with my SO of 6 years

60,"My (34f) husband (38m) maintained contact with a woman I asked him not to.


3 years ago we briefly had a financial planner who was an attractive single 20something. She friended us both on Facebook.




After a brief time, she changed jobs and no longer was doing financial planning, but she remained our friend on Facebook.  No problem.  However, she's the type of person who posts nearly daily selfies.  I started to notice my husband would leave little comments (nothing rude or inappropriate....mostly just silly or teasing her).  



I asked him a couple of times why he was doing that, and he said he always jokes around on friend's photos. I reminded him she's not even his friend, and he said she's as much a friend as his other virtual friends.  


Last year in one week she posted 2 pretty revealing photos.  One was her naked side (showing hip/butt) to show her new tattoo.  He wrote: looks amazing, but ouch!  Now, this sounds really silly, but he hates tattoos in general, so it irritated me that he's basically complimenting her on something I know he doesn't like.  The other was a pic of her laying down on the beach in a very tiny bikini.  He put a heart on that one.



I know I'm too old to be insecure about this stuff, but you guys, it just bugged me.  I also have a tattoo and he's never complimented me...in fact he's told me he isn't fond of any tattoos.  Either way, I had a discussion with him and told him I didn't like the way he interacts with her on Facebook, especially since she's not his friend and no longer has any professional dealings with us.  He apologized.






Recently my friend told me she saw him at a restaurant with her and her daughter. I asked him, and he looked scared but then admitted one day after work she had texted him asking if he liked the new financial planner, and he had been at a restaurant having a few beers with his male friend who had to leave so he invited her to join him.




I was really upset and casually mentioned this outing to her. She said yes, they had dinner and he was a bit wasted. She quickly told me it was nothing romantic (I believe it wasn't, at least on her side).  She also mentioned how they had met once before for drinks at this place just to ""shoot the breeze"".



He had never mentioned to me that he continued contact with her.  He sure didn't mention that he was hanging out with her ever.  He wouldn't have told me about this either had my friend not seen him.  We had a very explosive argument about it.  I accused him of continuing secret contact with her because he finds her attractive. He admitted she's fun to look at, but he never intended anything to happen in any way. He claims he just was bored and a bit drunk and wanted company. He reminded me that her daughter was there too.




He thinks I'm making a big deal out of something minor and that if he's guilty of anything it is not telling me that he continued contact with her, and of stupidly inviting her to join him because he was bored and wanted to drink some more.




I am in the thick of it, so I can't see if I'm being unreasonable.





**tldr; husband maintained contact with a woman I asked him not to, and in fact invited her and her child to eat dinner with him at a restaurant one night while he was drinking.**"
61,"Is it a red flag/deal breaker that my girlfriend [31F] begged me [27M] to pay for her dog's emergency surgery with the money I was supposed to spend for us to go to a mutual friend's destination wedding, but then is attending the wedding WITHOUT me because someone offered to pay for her travel expe


  I have been dating ""Maribel"" for two years. Maribel is a sales associate at a clothing store at the mall. I am a software engineer. Maribel used to have a roommate in an apartment, but within the last four months has moved in with me in my apartment.   
  

Maribel brought her thirteen year old chihuahua ""Max"" with her.   


  Max is aging and required a major stomach surgery, according to his vet, or else he would die.   


  Maribel cried and begged me to loan her the oney to pay for the surgery, which was several thousand dollars.   


  Our mutual friend ""Christie"" \[30F\] is having a fancy destination wedding near Halloween. Christie has always been ""goth"" so the Halloween theme, dressing all in black for the wedding is part of her persona. Christie and I knew each other briefly in high school but not for long as she was a senior and I was a freshman. We reconnected as adults because we work for the same tech company, and have been colleagues for five years. Ours is a strictly platonic relationship. Because Maribel is my girlfriend and always with me, she became Christie's good friend as well.     


  Christie invited both of us to go to the wedding but said she'd understand if we couldn't go, because it would be expensive to fly ourselves to the destination and rent a hotel room. I have a few thousand saved up for fun stuff, so I said we could go.   


  Then the thing with Max happened, so I naturally thought we could no longer go to the wedding.   


  However, one of Maribel's relatives offered her a couple thousand dollars so that she could buy herself a ticket and hotel accommodation and still attend the wedding.   


  Maribel said that if I could just come up with a few thousand dollars more, I can still attend, too.   


  I for one am thinking that Maribel should be worried more about paying me back the money I spent on her dog than attending a wedding. I also told her that I have zero intention of setting aside more of my paycheck to go to the wedding after I already spent thousands of dollars on a dog she does not consider mine also, but only hers. I am also doing her an emormous favor by letting her live in my much nicer apartment for practically nothing.   


  My original advice to her, which was that her dog is already quite old and surgery is risky and might not really improve the quality of his remaining life was met with comments by her that I was being ""cruel"" and ""selfish"" to think of money when ""family"" was at risk for dying. I don't think I should consider Max family if she consistently refers to him only as HER dog and not our dog, even though she will gladly let me buy his food and, obviously, pay his vet bills. Also, I think it says something about Maribel's responsibility as a pet owner if she does not have pet insurance or at least has some money put away for emergencies.   


  Maribel fully intends to attend the wedding while I will presumably be at home walking and feeding her dog. I know that if the situation were reversed (well, it would never actually happen because I would actually have money for emergencies), I wouldn't dream of leaving my SO at home to attend a wedding where we both had mutual friends. I would form a united front with my SO.  
 

 Am I being unreasonable feeling ill-used here? Is Maribel right that I am being cruel? Other than this thing, Maribel is in most other respects considerate and nice to me; we have a healthy sexual relationship, we have fun together. This just leaves me with a very negative feeling, though.  


  Whatever happens, I already have a gut feeling ever since the beginning that I will not see one red cent of my money again. I'm just wondering if this is a normal relationship thing.   
  Appreciate any insight!

  \*\*tl;dr: girlfriend borrowed my money for her dog's surgery. That money was supposed to fly us out to a friend's destination wedding. Now a relative of hers has offered to pay her expenses to the wedding. Girlfriend intends to go, and leave me behind. Am I wrong to feel bad?\*\* "
62,"My (25F) FWB's (32M) ex secretly teamed up with him and my BFF to get me a birthday gift


I'm changing some of the details here so my FWB can't find this easily.

I have two best friends, one male and one female. Let's call them **Paula** and **Danny**. Paula has been a friend of mine for about three years. Danny I've known for the same length of time, but we only became close in the last year, and during that time we also have dabbled in some sexual/lightly flirtatious stuff. Basically the most casual version of a relationship that you can get, which you will probably agree is for the best in light of what I'm about to say:

Danny is not over his ex,  who we'll call **Annette**. Danny and Annette broke up before I met either of them (aka: at least three years ago) but the dark cloud of their relationship has always kind of been something I am aware of. Annette was the dumper here-- she is one of those ""everything is rainbows, nothing could possibly be wrong in the world"" girls who probably hasn't dealt with too big of problems in her life, and lives comfortably working freelance and having her income supplemented by her family. Danny, on the other hand, deals with major depression and has for years. He also lives pretty comfortably but he came from nothing and has earned everything he's got. I don't know too much about the relationship but presumably that dynamic was not sustainable.

I will add as a disclaimer to this that Annette is still very much a presence in Danny's life in a way I don't really understand or like, and frankly seems unhealthy for both of them. Annette wants to believe she's helping Danny by insisting that she be there to support him through depression, but I think all Danny sees when he looks at her is this girl who broke his heart, but he doesn't put up boundaries for himself so he can heal on his own. One time when I was making out with Danny on a couch at a party, Annette walked by and flashed her ass at him. I gave her the eyebrow, and she giggled and skipped away. I thought it was in really poor taste, and I kind of got to see in that moment what the dynamic here is. I wouldn't call Annette my friend, but she is a person who is around my social circle occasionally, so I kind of just grin and bear the whole thing.

ANYWAY onto the story...

I was hanging out at Danny's house with him when he was showing me something on Facebook. My eyes caught sight of a group chat he had open-- only three people in the group chat were Danny, his ex Annette, and... my best female friend, Paula. Now, these three never hang out and would have no real reason to all 3 be talking to each other, so I got instantly suspicious. I apologized for being snoopy, but I did ask him what they were chatting about. He got really defensive, assuring me it was, ""Nothing for me to worry about.""

Well, I got worried anyway (I have clinical anxiety) and so for the rest of the day I was kind of fidgeting and quiet and really uncomfortable, and I'm generally trying to be better about pushing people, so in my head I was like, ""Ugh, you know what, I won't even ask him, I'll just let it go,"" which of course gave way within five minutes to my brain going, ""Why on Earth are my two best friends talking to one another, not only without me, but with Annette, who is a person I'm not a huge fan of to begin with?"" Anxiety is a trip!

Eventually I think Danny noticed it and we talked about what was up, he got ""permission"" to spill the story to me, and this is what he told me, basically (I am paraphrasing):

&gt;""Annette saw a post that you made a while back of a piece of jewelry you put on Facebook. She wanted to get you it as a gift for your birthday, but she didn't have the money, so I guess she messaged Paula to help her get the money. When Paula didn't have enough either, they both messaged me to help out. So, we've been talking trying to get it shipped out here and wrapped. I didn't think you'd see anything or get this nervous, though.""

I did not feel satisfied by this explanation but I didn't yet understand why, so I brushed it off and said, ""Aw, that's so sweet! Well, I'll give all of you a big hug and accept it. At least now we know for next time: I'm not a big fan of surprises."" Nice and clean, no problems.

However, I need to work through this in my head because I have to say I feel really weird about the fact that this was a situation that was started by Annette. This is kind of the crux of my question-- is it weird for me to receive a birthday gift from my two best friends, but one that had to be motivated by my one friend's ex? When he is currently sleeping with me??? Does this not seem strange?

Like I said, I don't understand Annette as a person very well, and to some extent I don't necessarily trust her/her motives, because I don't know what they are. I don't know that I would ever see one of my ex's current flings want a gift, and then go, ""Oh, I'm going to team up with my ex to get her that gift.""

It seems like this may be one of those ""Mean Girls"" tactics that people use on each other, and part of me can't help but feel like this gorgeous necklace I'm going to receive is one big trap somehow. It's also possible that Annette really is just as warm and bubbly as she makes herself out to be, and this is just such unbridled altruism that my cold dark heart can't comprehend it. Feel free to ask any questions if you need me to provide more context.

**TL;DR - My FWB's ex suggested they both (and my other best friend) get me a birthday gift. Should I feel weird that the idea came from her or should I just be grateful for the gift?**"
63,"My partner [35M] expects me [28F] to relocate for his career, but won't contemplate doing the same for me


My partner John [35M] of four years and I [28F] recently moved from a small quiet city on the west coast, where we met and lived together for several years, to a large city on the east coast. We were motivated to do this for a number of reasons - better professional opportunities, proximity to family, but most of all we were ready to try life in a big urban centre again.

We decided about a two years ago we wanted to try to relocate to the east coast, and both started applying on jobs. I had assumed that we'd jump on the first good offer either one of us got. That turned out to be me, but when the time came to make a decision John wasn't comfortable with the idea of being unemployed for an undefined amount of time, and so I passed. We had a big fight about it, but he felt that I had more opportunities that he did in the city we were trying to get to, so we should wait until he got something and I could find another job at that point (he was probably right). A few months later he got a great offer and took it, and we moved about a year ago. I pounded the pavement when we got here, and landed a fantastic job pretty much right away that I love.

Unfortunately, while the whole move worked out great for me, he hasn't been too happy with our new home city, and is struggling in the job. We're contemplating moving back west in another couple years, and started talking tonight about how we might go about that. I feel like I could stay here but John is unhappy, and I know I'm okay living in either place. I expressed that I didn't want what happened last time to happen again - if we were to move back, I wanted an opportunity for either one of us to be able to get us there. This is probably also a good time to mention that we make equal salaries (my earning potential likely higher than his overall); I'm generally more career-motivated; but he has considerably more years of experience than I do (age difference).

The discussion completely blew up. Even though it's John who wants to get back to our old city, he doesn't like the idea of me being the slingshot that takes us both there if I can find a job before he can. He saw his mom be financially vulnerable her whole life, and never wants to be in that position himself - even though I feel we are a committed couple and I'd be more than happy (and financially capable with my salary) to support us both while he finds a new job. He just can't handle the idea of being unemployed -- but has no problem expecting me to follow him back there without a job.

I'm frustrated. He insists he respects my career, and acknowledges that I place more value on my career than he does his. But the hypocrisy is really hard to deal with, especially when I've already been put in the position of relocating without a job in the bag once, and we're considering another cross-country move because he's so miserable with big city life. I know not everything in relationships is perfectly equal and that's okay, and that this is still a hypothetical decision a couple years away, but am I crazy for thinking this is really unfair? We're usually able to talk through conflict, but he can't seem to empathize with me on this, and I feel like we're totally stuck.

TL;DR - my partner and I moved across the country for his job, and we're looking at moving back in a couple years. He will only entertain a move back if he gets a job offer, and isn't comfortable following my career there, even though we're on equal footing salary-wise. I don't know how to move this conversation forward."
64,"I [21F] finally caved and snooped on his [21] phone. I found what I feared


This is very long, so please read the TL;DR if you need!

Been with my SO for 11 months. Until April, everything was great - perfect even. But then I found out he was texting his ex behind my back inappropriately.
Now, according to him, their relationship was extremely toxic and they fought constantly.

He had told me they were not in contact anymore, but when we were chilling, she randomly called him out of the blue and he panicked. He quickly deleted all of their texts, so I guess I will never know what they actually said to each other. Obviously this was a big red f*cking flag waving straight in front of my face, but he somehow managed to convince me it was nothing, so I forgot about it.

That is until a month later I stumbled across his ACTUAL Instagram (that he had previously denied he actually has) with flirtatious comments on his ex's pictures from whilst we had been dating. I flipped, we nearly broke up, and I was absolutely devastated. Again, I was so in denial about the situation that he managed to convince me nothing was going on. I told him I couldn't be with him if he was talking to her anymore. I'm all cool with ex's being friends, but he crossed a line I am not comfortable with AT ALL. He apologised and cried, telling me he will erase her from everything and that he would do anything to earn my trust back.

However since then, I have never trusted him the same. Yesterday I did something I have never done - I snooped on his social media. I know it was wrong and a complete invasion of privacy, but I had a gut feeling something was wrong. And bingo, I was right. After promising to remove her from everything, he has re-added her on social media, and they have talked since he made the promise to me. Since it was Snapchat, their conversation was gone. But it still had a time stamp dating to a month AFTER he had agreed not to contact her again. Of course, he doesn't know that I know.

So, this is where I need help. My SO gets very defensive during arguments and I want to raise this as non-confrontationally as possible. Although I've caught him lying, I feel infinitely ashamed that I snooped. How should I go about this reddit?

TL;DR: after my SO lied twice about talking to his ex inappropriately, so I gave him an ultimatum of cutting contact or the relationship ending. Months later I had a hunch about this still continuing, so I snooped. As I thought, they are still in contact and he has broken his promise to build trust. Unsure of how to proceed"
65,"I (24M) have hit the career lottery, but the deal requires moving to another major city. My gf (24f) of 4 years now gets upset at the mere mention of the city's name.


Firstly, I apologize for the wall of text and deeply appreciate anyone who would try to navigate my semicoherent ramblings to give me perspective that I am clearly lacking. I've tried to talk to a few people in real life for advice, including people who normally understand and take her side, and am still completely lost. Feel free to be brutally honest with me. I'm clearly missing something, and if whatever that is hurts then I'd rather hear it now than figure it out later.

We are both career oriented, and a year ago I left my own company to take a bet on a small startup working on a product I really believed in.

That company is now getting rolled into a company that is internationally famous for being an amazing place to work, and I would actually have the opportunity to work at the intersection of my two largest interests directly with the head of a division (young exec at our company that I am really cool with / look up to and want to keep working with and learning from) they are creating out of this deal to do basically exactly what I have wanted to do at a scale that I've always dreamed of, with a boss that would give me a ton of autonomy to do what I want and own it. We both have good careers, but I already am the primary breadwinner and based on conversations with our CEO I expect my comp to more than double.

Long story short, I love my girlfriend and am serious about our relationship, but this deal is so good that I am not sure that I could turn it down without regretting it forever and becoming resentful. Plus this company was the only company I could find doing this kind of work here (even it is in a smaller neighboring city that I have to commute to) and it's not going to be here anymore, so I don't even know what I would do if I stayed. I could definitely find a job, but probably not something I'd be happy doing in as interesting or lucrative of a niche.

The only catch is that I have to move to another city in a relatively quick timeline (6 months). I don't like the city I live in currently (she has known this since we first met, and living here this long has been a negotiated compromise on my side) and have always planned to move anyway (there isn't a real ecosystem for my long term goals here), with this new city being one of my top choices, so this is actually a plus from my perspective. She really likes her company, and they have another larger office in this new city that she could transfer to, and it would probably be a good career decision for her to do so as this new city is probably the most important city in the world for her industry. We also already have friends there, and the new city is a relatively reasonable train ride away (like 3 hrs), so I don't see this as that drastic of a transition.

We have talked about moving repeatedly since literally the day we met, as I was considering dropping out of college to move away at the time, so this isn't out of left field. She's always been tepid about the prospect, but generally open to the idea, particularly if it was for a lucrative reason.

Now that it is a reality, she essentially won't even discuss it. When I bring it up she says the city is dirty and she would be miserable there, reiterating that point many times, and then making off the cuff remarks about people who lived there and eventually moved back. After many attempts at understanding and trying to be supportive while still being clear about how insane this opportunity is, that we can live in whatever nice part  of the city we want where we'll both be able to walk to work, that we can come back whenever we want to visit, and move back in a year if we need to, that I'd take care of everything, and that we already have a social circle there, she's mentioned that she had a traumatic experience being forced to move states in her last year and a half of highschool, and that this brings up the same feelings. 

I think this emotional backdrop likely is the real reason for her not wanting to move. I have tried to be clear that I understand that it must have been painful to uprooted from your friends at such an important time, and that I want to help assuage these concerns and make her feel good about the whole arrangement, that we can live anywhere we want there and that there are nice areas seeing as it's one of the most expensive cities in the world, if cleanliness is a concern I'll pay for a maid service, that I'll be socially proactive to make us feel at home there, that it doesn't have to be a permanent move, that we can come back whenever we want, and that we'll have eachother and wouldn't be alone like she was when she moved when she was younger. The only thing I guess I can't do is integrate her into the new office, but she's sociable and an extrovert anyway, so I don't really think that's a major problem. We

I'm not sure what else I can do, and am very serious about our relationship, but I also don't realistically think I can turn down this offer without regretting it forever.

This unwillingness to even seriously discuss the possibility of moving to take the offer up, even for a year, despite me currently living here as a known compromise on my end and having talked about this kind of thing for years has me confused and a bit frustrated. 

I would be ecstatic if the roles were reversed and she got an offer in a major city to do exactly what she wants at multiple times what I make, and would go with her in a heartbeat, so I am having a hard time understanding.

Should I move by myself and just have us visit in both directions for a while to ease her into the idea? I would then end up paying for two apartments (or one and a half I guess) in two of the most expensive cities in the country since she couldn't quite afford our current place by herself, which I wouldn't be stoked about, especially since I want to live together and think we would have a great time in that new city together, but that's whatever I guess.

&gt;tl;dr: I have the offer I've been dreaming about for my entire career, but have to move to take it. We've talked about moving the entire time we've been together, even about this city in particular, but now that it's a real thing my gf won't even talk about it.

Does anyone have any insight into what I'm missing or what I should do? I'm just completely lost."
66,"Am I(27m) wrong for not letting my gf(27f) drive my car?


We've been dating 8 months and moved in together a month ago. She doesn't have a vehicle currently because her last one got repossessed. 

The long story short version is that I drive a Dodge Challenger. I worked hard to get it and I put alot of effort into maintaining it and driving it safely. It is my dream car that I put in a bunch of sweat and tears into being able to afford. It's a car I want to pass on one day.

She's wanting to get on the insurance so she can drive it. But, She has a history of careless driving. Multiple wrecks, tickets,etc. This makes her insurance incredibly expensive. 


The insurance on her last vehicle(a kia suv) was 300 a month. My insurance on my Challenger with full coverage is $85.(I don't even know if we could afford her being insured for my car).

I don't let anyone else drive it and the thought of her driving it gives my anxiety. Am I overreacting?


Tl;dr: My girlfriend doesn't drive safe and is mad I won't let her drive my car. Who is right?"
67,"My [19f] so called friend [19f] told the guy I am dating [19m] to not ask me out. She thinks she was ""being protective"". What do I do?


So, to spare all the long details, the guy I am dating who I really like and I wish to keep dating told me my friend told him to not even ask me out.

She lied and said I wasn't interested in dating at the moment and he wasn't my type anyway. He asked me out anyway and I was thrilled. My friend didn't like it but kept quiet.

Now he told me and I was pretty angry about it. She later said she is ""very protective"" of me and has shoo'd away other guys before. I was speechless and just left.

I really have no words and I'm considering ending everything with her, but I still have to see her for the rest of our college career. I don't mean to forgive her just because of this, but it will sure be awkward.

What should I do? Sorry if this is too dramatic. I tried to keep the long dramatic details to the minimum.

68,"My [20M] younger brother's [17M] boyfriend [17M] sent my brother screenshots of fake texts that showed me as homophobic


We have been close ever since childhood. When he was coming out out as gay, I was the first person he told. I went off to college a couple years ago and we still talk every day.  He started dating his boyfriend a couple months ago. I honestly did not like him though. He never gave my brother much respect and my brother essentially put up with it.

Recently they have hit a rough patch and my brother would talk to me about it every night. I told him he should do what makes him happy and if that means he should break up with his boyfriend then he should. I'm not sure but I think his boyfriend saw these texts and got very upset with me.

Last night, by brother sent me an angry text asking what the hell was going on. He then sent me screenshots of a conversation I had with his boyfriend but it included texts that I never sent him. I was talking to him about what to get my brother for his birthday. There was a fake text in there that said something along the lines of ""I don't understand what you gays like."" That wasn't the only one but they were all homophobic.

My brother was very angry. He thought I was homophobic and that the texts were real. I tried to explain everything but he just wouldn't listen.

I am not sure what to do right now. We are still apart because I found a job while at college so I can't talk to him face to face. Is there a way to show him the texts aren't real? We all have an Iphone if that helps but I don't think it does.

tl;dr my brother's boyfriend sent him screenshots of fake texts and I don't know how to prove they are fake."
69,"My (30sF) parents (late 60s M/F) are considering returning a generous gift from my in-laws (early 60s M/F). Need advice on how to keep the peace!


So earlier this month, me, my husband, my parents and my in-laws all spent a week together at my parents beach house. 

They have owned this house for years and do not live there. They have also never rented it and have always been very generous in letting anyone in our family who asks stay there for free.

My husband and I have stayed there in the past and always bought and left some kind of thank you gift - a nice bottle of bourbon for my Dad, a restaurant gift card, etc.  In total, we usually spend between $150 and $250 on this gift depending on how long we stayed and how many people were there.  Basically acknowledging that we inflated their utilities for however long and we appreciate using the house. 

This year, my husband and I bought my parents a gift card and my in-laws took us all out to dinner while we were there. I figured that was that. 

But a few days after we returned, my parents called and said that my in-laws had left $500 in cash as a thank you gift in the room where they stayed.

My parents say they are hurt and offended by this money and are going to return it to them.

My in-laws are very proud and stubborn people and I know if my parents do this they will be extremely offended. I don’t know if it will effect my relationship with them but I know for certain it will effect their relationship with my parents.

I’ve tried to talk to my Mom about this but she basically shuts down and says their pride was hurt and they consider us all family and guests at their home.  They also say they don’t want to accept the money because they don’t want it to happen again. 

Knowing my in-laws, if my parents return this money they will never come to the beach house again. 

I’d like some help trying to understand my parents position so I can talk to them before they put this money in an envelope and mail it back.  

I’ve suggested donating the money to charity or saving it for a nice dinner for the next time we are all together - both suggestions are not well-received. 

My husband thinks I should stay out of it - but I am really afraid of how much this will damage their relationship as well as the relationship I currently have with my in-laws.

Also any advice you have on how to get my parents to see the other side of this, not just their hurt pride would be appreciated! 

TL;DR: In-laws gave my parents $500 as a thank you for letting them stay at their beach house during a family vacation. My parents want to return it."
70,"Friend (24F) cheated on mutual friend (26M) and is now upset we’re hanging out without her.


So, I have a group of friends and we’re used to hanging out pretty frequently, every weekend, at the very least. We go to the movies, party, or just hang out &amp; play some games, drink some beers. Some of us even found a shared hobby we really like and now we do that together as well. 


Anyways, one of our friends, Lola, got into a relationship with George. They’ve been on and off for some years now and about two months ago, they weren’t together and she started insinuating that she wanted something with him again - inviting him over to sleep at her house, kissing him, holding hands, inviting him over for family dinner, etc. George is also my boyfriend’s brother and they live together, so we saw the relationship develop. Turns out, she was lying to our other friends and telling them that nothing was going on between them. George is the stoic type, so he pretended like he was unaffected but pretty soon he became anxious and wanted to know what was going on. He asked Lola and she said she wanted a relationship, a “casual” one but monogamous. She said that she could see herself with him in the future. George told us all of this, and the group dynamic stayed the same. We made plans together, just like always. I was excited because we were all pretty hyped about this new hobby and sharing articles / techniques / etc. 


I went away for a couple of weeks &amp; it turns out that she had gone on vacation with another guy and cheated on George. She told him and said she’d give it a try with that dude. But meanwhile she kept texting me like nothing happened and kept on making plans with me, so I didn’t say anything, but I was confused because clearly those plans would be compromised if she was with another dude. George wouldn’t be able to be there, my boyfriend would be pretty uncomfortable and I guess I’d be uncomfortable too. 


So this weekend we hung out together / went to parties / played games like we always do but Lola wasn’t there. She hasn’t told me anything but I texted her and she was pretty cold with me. My friends say that she’s angry that she’s been left out but imo she’s the one who wronged George and she needs to deal with not being invited sometimes after she’s done something like that. But I can’t even tell her that because she never said a thing about their relationship to me and now seems to be angry. 


I guess what I want to know is how to navigate this. Would I be wrong if I was angry with her? I feel like she doesn’t trust me and I thought we had a better relationship than that. But at the same time I don’t even know if we’re friends like that. I have a hard time reading levels of intimacy and since she’s so loving and has given me super dedicated and detailed gifts I thought we were good friends. Could I say anything or wait until it blows over? 


**TL;DR**: Friend (24F) cheated on a mutual friend (26M) and is now upset with us when we hang out without her. I don’t know if I should be angry at her, say something to her about it or let it blow over and talk to her when things are more calm. "
71,"My Husband [32M] keeps threatening me [27F] for Divorce after 1 month of Marriage


I have been married a month now and it's been a mess. I moved to the south where my husband is, and really disliked it. He's been telling me to find a job, and I've been looking for something part time, but I have been feeling especially homesick (I've never left my mother and siblings before marriage; my father had passed away), and I left my amazing career and a master's program to be with him. I would keep asking if he would consider moving up north. We would end up getting into HUGE fights, to the point where he would threaten me with divorce (he did it with my mom on facetime last time) and he'd slam the door and go to his family's home, leaving me in the apartment alone. His family DENIES everything he does or says. Up to this point, he has threatened me with divorce 3 times. At one point, he dragged me to his parent's house, bashed me in front of them, screamed and called me a liar, and left me crying on the couch by myself in front of his mom and dad. I was beyond hurt and disappointed, especially since I told him to keep things between us only. I'm back at home to visit, but he picked a fight with me because I didn't answer the phone, even though he knew I was at a funeral. He kept telling me I was lying, that he wanted me to stay away. I told him fine. And that was the 3rd time he threatened me with divorce.

My mom called his father but he took his son's side, saying his son doesn't owe an apology and that I'm being a ""bad wife"" by staying away. My husband eats up this NONSENSE and is acting like I'M the one who is asking for divorce. I just feel so devastated. Things unraveled so fast, and there's so much disrespect towards myself and my family. My husband wouldn't treat me like something of value when I was there; he never took my opinion and would constantly call his mother, tell her about his day, and ask for her opinion. I got so offended at one point, I argued with him about it and he felt bad. There are times where I feel like he's capable of changing, but when I remember his temper tantrums, and the fact that he listens to his family and tells them everything between us, then lies about doing so, I get sick to my stomach.

**TL;DR:** It has been a messy  month of marriage, and I feel like my husband has disrespected me by threatening divorce 3 times. Should I be the one to do it?"
72,"My boyfriend [20M] ripped my [19F] favorite dress during foreplay and we both got upset at each other. Am I overreacting/being unreasonable?


Last night, my boyfriend and I were fooling around on his bed after we got back from a night out. I was wearing my favorite dress that my mom passed down to me. It's this vintage and handmade, black-mini dress made out of pure silk. It was my mom's favorite dress when she was young. It also comes from her home country so it's not made here in the US and of course, they don't make these dresses anymore. It's also the dress that my mom wore when she went to the premier of the first film she directed. I love this dress so so much and it means a lot to me.

Anyway, my boyfriend was on top of me and we were just making out. Then, he stuck his hand underneath my dress from the bottom and was pretty gently so I didn't say anything more than, ""be careful with my dress"" to which he grunted his acknowledgement to. Then out of fucking nowhere he retreats his hand to the bottom edge of my dress and starts trying to tug it off. Of course silk is not a stretchy material at all and is very delicate. So all he had to do was tug forcefully once and it tore apart at the seam along my leg. I heard the tear before I even registered what he was trying to do and I just froze. I shoved him off, sat up and sure enough, saw the foot-long tear. He saw too and all he said was, ""Oops, sorry.""   


I immediately started just bawling and asking him how he could do this through my tears. Now, he knows the significance of this dress to me. I've explained it to him many many times. I yelled some things out of anger like ""Could you fucking be any less careful?"" and ""Are you fucking serious?! I told you to be careful!!"". He told me to, ""Chill the fuck out"" and said that ""it's just a dress for fuck's sake"" I just stared at him like how the fuck can he say that?! Especially since I've explained the significance to him before. Then he blamed me for ""killing the mood"" and ""ruining the night"". After he said that, I basically blew up at him and we had a screaming match. After that, I fled his place (still in tears) and ubered home where I cried even more. 

I haven't spoken to him since last night and I really don't want to. I'm still so fucking pissed and angry at him. I'll admit that I blamed him last night and said some shitty things but only after he began telling me that ""it's just a fucking dress"" and accusing me. I thought my anger was pretty justified. 

Am I overreacting/being unreasonable? Who should apologize here?

TL;DR: Boyfriend ripped my favorite dress during foreplay last night. The dress has emotional significance to me as well as being one of a kind. I cried and he told me to ""chill the fuck out"" and that it's ""just a fucking dress"", then accused me of ruining the mood. I also screamed at him and blamed him but felt that my anger was justified. Am I overreacting/being unreasonable?"
73,"Me [26M] with my girlfriend [26F] Of two years. She told a horrible lie and I don't know what to do


My girlfriend ""Callie"" met in college, but we only started dating two years ago, after we graduated. We went to a really small school, where it's possible to know a large portion of the students. Callie was extroverted and involved in a lot of activities, so she had a lot of friends.

One day during the summer between sophomore and Junior year, Callie told me and all her other college friends about this crazy girl, ""Monica"" whom Callie had gone to high school with. Callie explained that after Monica's parents split, Monica's father and Callie's mother dated for awhile. Monica was delusional, and was convinced that she and Callie were actually sisters, and that Callie's mother was responsible for Monica's parents splitting up. Monica ended up harassing Callie, and it got so bad that Callie ended up transferring to another school. Callie wanted to warn us in advance in case Monica said something to us.

Obviously, I wasn't going to be friends with someone like Monica, so I figured I'd just stay away from her, but unfortunately, she ended up being in some of my classes because we had the same major. Even worse, she ended up filling the empty room in a suite with my girlfriend at the time (not Callie). My girlfriend and her other roommates said Monica was clearly nuts. She was obsessed with Callie, and constantly talked about how Callie and her mom were liars, and how Monica would make sure everyone knew the truth.

My girlfriend told me that Monica tried to show her proof of all of this. My girlfriend didn't want to see it and told Monica to back off. Monica shoved the phone in her face to show her a screen shot of a conversation between Monica and Callie, where Callie acknowledged that they were sisters, and that their father had cheated on Monica's mother with Callie's mother, but my girlfriend said it was obviously photo shopped. My girlfriend told a bunch of people what Monica did, and Callie explained that she had done the same thing back in high school, but people had believed Monica back then, which caused the harassment.

One of the other roommates had another incident with Monica, when Monica tried to get the roommate to talk to one of Monica's high school friends who was on the phone, saying that the friend could vouch for Monica, but the roommate didn't want to hear it, and screamed at Monica in earshot of a bunch of other people, which kept the gossip going. This was a small school, so at that point a lot of people knew Monica as the crazy one.

The last time I saw Monica, I was with my gaming club in the student Union. Monica asked me if she could join, and I said okay, but that didn't make me her brother. The whole group laughed, including me. I don't really know why I said that. Monica ran out of the room crying, and moved out of the dorm shortly after, and didn't come back to school.

Now in the present, I hadn't thought about Monica for awhile, but something reminded me of her. I asked Callie if she had ever heard from Monica after that or knew what happened to her.

Callie got a guilty look on her face and told me the truth. Callie had apparently been lying the whole time. Callie's mother and father had had an affair while no Monica's mother was pregnant, and Callie was born a few months later. Their father left Monica's mother for Callie's mother. He eventually skipped out on Callie and her mother too, so it wasn't until high school that Callie and Monica found out that they were sisters. So Monica was never crazy after all.

Callie swore that she told the truth about the harassment, and that she told the lie to protect herself. According to Callie, Monica had sent her a message taunting her about how she was going to start at our college, and tell everyone about Callie's ""slut mom"". 

The thing is, I don't know if I believe Callie that Monica was that bad. Callie has lied so much already, between the smear campaign and never telling me, her boyfriend of two years, that she had a sister. Callie told me that her strategy was to control the whole thing by starting the rumor first, so that nobody would believe Monica. But the whole thing seemed devious and cruel. She does not seem to understand or care that she did the same thing that Monica apparently did to her. And it was unnecessary. Callie was already well liked, nobody would have harassed her, even if they believed what Monica said. Callie basically ruined someone's college experience over something that didn't even happen. I also think it's possible that Monica only acted that way because she showed up to school to find that everyone already hated her and thought she was crazy.

I don't know how to verify anything Callie said. She said the message from Monica is long gone, and the only people I know who could verify the harassment from high school are Callie's family, who would probably tell her if I asked questions.

I don't know how to best react now that I know the truth. I'm not saying Callie should have been Monica's friend or treated her as family, but I really think this crossed a line. I know this happened awhile ago, but I'm seeing a darker side of Callie now. It occurred to me that she could do this to someone else she doesn't like. I also regret how I made Monica's time at school worse, and I feel awful now that I know the truth. Do you have any advice on how to handle this?

Tldr: my girlfriend made a bunch of people believe that a classmate was crazy, but my girlfriend lied to make her leave the school.
"
74,"My boyfriend [24m] always tells me [22f] not to talk about inappropriate topics in public. I feel like I can't have a conversation at all without him telling me to change the topic.



My boyfriend Dan always tells me ""Don't talk about that when people can hear you"" and I feel like most of the stuff he says that about is stuff that's just normal conversation. I'll give a couple examples so you get the idea.

We were at the supermarket and he asked me if I was going to my friend Jim's party. I said I wasn't sure yet. He asked why. I said ""I told Jim that me and the girls wouldn't go if Mark was gonna be there, cause Mark's been a huge creep to us all."" Dan shushed me, and whispered ""Don't talk about that here"" 

Another time, we were on the bus, and I was talking about my old roommate, and how she was still dating a teacher she had in high school, who came onto her basically immediately after she graduated. And how sketchy that was. Dan basically told me off for saying that on the bus. Which felt kinda ridiculous because there's worse stuff you hear on buses; there was some strung out druggie woman talking to herself just a few seats back.

Another time, we were in the pharmacy, and I said ""What brand of lube did you like better? I forget"" And held up two bottles. He got really irritated when we got back in the car.

And one more time, he got snippy with me for saying ""Did I tell you what my therapist said this morning?"" Because apparently seeing a therapist is another inappropriate topic.

In general, I feel like I have to put on some kinda picture perfect act every time we're outside one of our apartments. Like I can't tell the truth about conflicts in my friend group, weird shit I've seen in life, or ask even basic questions about lube and condoms, in the lube and condoms aisle of the pharmacy...

It's not like he minds those topics in general. I think it's more like an anxiety thing, that he's worried about strangers overhearing and judging us. But it's really stressing me out, because I never know what he's going to tell me is a no-no topic for him. I feel like I've got to put on an act every time we're outside, or else we're going to argue.

But I don't know if I'm in the wrong, and I really could do to tone it down a little. So I'm looking for a few second opinions. Is the kinda stuff I say stuff I should be embarrassed to say in a public place? If not, how can I talk to my boyfriend about how much this is stressing me out?

TLDR - My boyfriend frequently tells me the stuff I talk about is inappropriate to say in public, but I'm not so sure it is.


"
75,"My husband (27M) very early in our marriage, was caught spreading my nudes on tumblr. I (30F) forgave him at the time but had lost much love, trust, and respect for him.


Throwaway account since many IRL knows my Reddit handle. Long post, so sorry for the wall of text.

I was married last year. We had lived together 6 months before marriage, had been in relationship a year before that, and had known each other a year before, so I thought when I married him, I had known everything necessary that should be known. Boy I was wrong. 

About a month after marriage, a foreign friend sent me a screenshot of a post he found on Tumblr. It was something called covered-and-uncovered, depicting a picture of me (in full clothes with my face in full view and very identifiable) next to a picture of someone naked who looked like me. I was overwhelmed with horror. Thankfully, I was able to prove to my friend it wasn't me although the lady looked very similar (I had a surgery scar on my stomach, the naked woman in the picture did not). 

Naturally, I told my husband about this. I asked Tumblr to remove the picture and then mentioned to my husband that I would pursue police, since I was sure it was someone who knew me who posted it. Why else would that someone go through the trouble of looking a look-alike? 

My husband shared my grief and anger... until the next day. He asked me what I would do if I catch the perpetrator, and I answered in anger, ""Why, I'd kill him, of course!""

He was silent for a while, and then suddenly burst in tears. He admitted to me he was the one who posted it online. He had this fetish, that he got horny when people admire me or mention wanting to fuck me, but he didn't really want it to happen IRL so he posted it on Tumblr. Tumblr isn't widespread in my country and it is blocked by our ministry of communication so he thought it a perfect media (he forgot I studied abroad so I had a lot of foreign friends, and one of these happened to see that post). That picture he posted before we were married. He begged me for forgiveness and promised to never do it again.

I was... a coward. It was very early in our marriage. My parents might really kill themselves had they known this from shame (yes, it was just such a culture with us). I was crazily in love with him. Outside of this side of him, he was the perfect partner. In a culture where husbands expect to be waited on hands-and-feet by their wives, I thought I was lucky to find someone who sees me as an equal partner. All my friends whom I introduced to him said he was a good man. He was the golden child of my parents, and he never hesitate to show that he loves me. But that day, all of this was shattered. 

In the end, I chose to forgive him. I knew if I divorce him, the reason why would come out. Police would move since posting nudes is considered pornography in my country and my husband might get up to 6 years sentence. Prison life here is brutal; if someone gets in whose crime relate to sexual matters, just expect that his asshole would be much, much wider by the time he comes out. My husband isn't a very strong man physically and a life like that in prison would have killed him. 

In the end, I decided to give him another chance. I told my concerned friend that everything is solved and the post has already been taken down by Tumblr following my request. But even though I forgave him, I couldn't help breeding a resentment. 

Life was back to normal for a few weeks after that... when once again the same friend, who was really a Tumblr afficionado, sent me another post. This time it was really my nudes. It was me posing for my husband in skirt only and no panties, and the skirt had a very unique pattern that I instantly knew it was me although the face was not shown. And next to the picture, was the picture of me walking around shopping at a mall for identification. My husband, my beloved husband whom I crazily loved, posted my nudes with my normal picture for identification. Under that, there were still many posts, most of them my nudes from different angles, all without face. 

I was more than horrified this time. I confronted my husband, he admitted it (in another burst of tears) that he posted them around the same time, but didn't have the courage to admit everything to me because he feared I would leave him if I found out he had gone farther than just posting a look-alike. 

Very stupidly, for the same reason, I forgave him... again. He swore he wouldn't do that again, I requested Tumblr to take down everything again, and life was back to normal. Except that it wasn't.

I was breeding a very strong resentment. I felt humiliated, deceived, and used, like a sex doll whose purpose was only for his pleasure, especially after he admitted his fetish, he started to talk dirty when we had sex as if he wanted me to be fucked by many strangers. It killed my mood but I didn't have the heart to tell him, so I just played along. I didn't want to hear the necessary drama had I brought this up. My husband is a very emotional person and would cry and beat his head against a wall until it bleeds crazy if I remind him in what he did, just like when I confronted him with the Tumblr post. 

And so a year passed. But I couldn't get rid of the resentment. Even worse, my love, trust, and respect for him had mostly vanish. I still care about him and his well-being, of course. But I no longer wanted to have any children with this man (and had put an IUD which I refused to take out no matter what). I no longer wanted to have sex with him - and every time we did, I would fake orgasm as quickly as possible so we could finish faster and I could go back to whatever I was doing.

Now, I feel frustrated, resenting, and out of respect. But I couldn't bring up the source problem since it has been a year. It's like heating an already rotting food; it's long overdue. 

I had contemplated divorce a few times, but fail to find any reason to pursue it. Besides I am afraid that in my 30th year, nobody would want to be with me again and I would be lonely all my life (in my country, women over 25 are considered leftover, old virgin, a spinster, and the chance of marriage especially if a divorced widow, will diminish heavily). I didn't know what to do, and it makes me crazy. Therapy is not available in my country except something relating to religion, and most therapists will just say I didn't pray enough, while I am an atheist. This is a country whose majority think earthquakes and tsunamis are God's punishment for allowing LGBT to exist. I didn't want to go to any religion-based therapy over here. 

I couldn't tell this to anyone IRL. I only have you, Reddit, to turn into. I was hoping you could give me outside perspective. Was what he did a year ago enough reason for me to contemplate divorce? Should I tell him everything? Should I tell someone else? 

TL;DR: My newly married husband shared nudes of me on Tumblr a year ago because he had a fetish. I forgave him, but has been building resentment along with the drastic decrease in love, trust, and respect for my husband. Have been contemplating divorce over the past year, but since I had forgiven him, I didn't know if it was okay or not to confront him again with my feelings?"
76,"My husband [26M] of two years gets extremely mad at our dogs for situations that are his fault


I know this might sound like a weird marriage problem, but it's been giving me a lot of anxiety. Me [23F] and my husband have three dogs and a cat. He has his dog before we got married, and was always pretty strict with him, but never excessively so.

When we moved into our first house together, he suddenly got obsessed with the dogs having to ""listen."" My dog has some separation anxiety, and if you leave dirty clothes in the floor he'll chew on them if he is left for more than a few hours. It's as easy to fix as just putting dirty clothes on the counter or in the hamper if we plan to be gone for a while. This doesn't stop my husband from forgetting to pick up his clothes and then getting insanely mad when the dogs chews a hole in something. Supposedly because the dogs should ""know better"" and ""just listen to him.""

There are many situations that are similar to this, but the biggest happened recently. He has a nice gaming computer that is set up in the living room, but most of the accessories are corded and run to his lounge chair. The only way to navigate our tight living room is to step over the cords and walk in front of the TV to get to the front door. So we've had some incidents where the dogs run in and accidentally get tangled in the cords because they misjudge the jump. My husband has the habit of leaving all his accessories in the chair even when he isn't playing, which leaves the cords stretched across the walkway.

I've been preventing accidents by disconnecting his accessories before I let the dogs in, but he refuses to follow suit. So the other morning he let the dogs in and they pulled his computer off the shelf and it hit the floor. Since then he has been insufferable about the animals. If he isn't shutting them in a bedroom saying they need to ""learn a lesson"" he is saying we should just give the animals away.

I know the dogs have no idea why he is mad and it's completely inappropriate how he is treating them. Especially since all of this is preventable if he would just pick up after himself! If I talk to him about this, he just gets extremely mad and tells me that I am too soft and don't know how to raise a dog? I don't know what to do anymore!

TL;DR: Husband is punishing the dogs for things they do that were preventable by him just picking up after himself. I'm tired of the dog abuse but he won't listen."
77,"I'm (28 M) worried that my wife's (26 F) hobby is becoming an obsession


(Been married about a year) 

A few months ago my wife started getting really into decorative gourd painting, she's always been an artsy person so this wasn't that weird. She started following a bunch of accounts of people on Etsy and Pinterest who do it. 

She buys a lot of painted gourds from these people, and also tries to make her own. She does it by buying fresh gourds from the farmer's market then trying to cure them, but she doesn't usually do it correctly so they end up going bad (I have no idea what proper gourd preservation technique is, I just know they're supposed to last several weeks to months)

Now here's the thing, when they go bad she denies that they're bad. They'll just sit there rotting away because she insists she did it right. 

I have found rotten, nearly liquid gourd on the top of the cabinets after having a bad smell in the kitchen for a week. I understand the reluctance to get rid of something she worked on, but by then they're not even gourds anymore, they're moldy sludge. They've gone bad inside a display cabinet she bought, in bowls, and on windowsills. 

Also our apartment is practically overflowing with decorative gourds at this point. She just keeps buying them and doing this nearly every day. All the rooms have at least a few gourd displays even the bathroom. There's one on top of the toilet tank. There's a huge pile on the kitchen table, that is so big it covers almost the whole table. It's not just a few in the center, that would be fine, I mean that there's so many gourds they're spread out almost to the edges. We can't eat at the table without moving some, which she won't do. 

I've started to get worried about our budget because the amount she spends on Etsy decorative gourds, farmers market gourds, and gourd curing/painting supplies surpasses even the monthly rent. 

I'm also worried about her mental health, when nearly all her time is spent on this. Sometimes she'll watch a show with me at night but usually she's either on the internet looking at gourd stuff or working on her own displays. I'm starting to feel like we barely spend any time together even though we live together. 

As an outside observer her focus on this to the exclusion of most other things is a really big change to me, she doesn't seem unhappy but she used to have other interests. Now this is all she wants to do.

To be clear I'm not saying I want her to quit the gourd hobby completely. But any hint that maybe she buys more than she needs (seriously, there's 3 bags full of ones she hasn't touched yet) is met with categorical denial. She doesn't even consider that it might be excessive if there's over 30 decorative gourds in a single room (This is the living room, just counted 32. She says it's no different from a room with 32 books or 32 dvd's)

Am I over-reacting? How do I express my worries without sounding like I'm accusing her of being crazy or wanting her to stop doing something she likes? Maybe focus just on the money issue?

tl;dr: My wife of almost a year has been cultivating a massive ornamental gourd collection. She doesn't like to throw them out when they start rotting. Most surfaces in our apartment are taken over by gourd displays and it's difficult to use them now. I'm worried about money and her single-minded attitude around this one activity. I feel like I hardly get any real time with her."
78,"My [25F] friend [26M] won't believe that he smells. How do I convince him that he does?


He does not believe that he sweats.  He has been shown evidence, but he still doesn't believe anyone when they tell him that he sweats.  He gets in arguments if anyone tried to tell him that he does.  He's convinced that he is some kind of superhuman that never sweats.  He also believes that he has special genetics that make it so never smells.  Then he sits in the sun with a sweater on, sweats, and stinks up the whole house when he visits.  I don't think he washes his hair because it's always greasy.  I do believe that he takes a shower every day, but I highly doubt that he uses soap.  He doesn't wear deodorant.

He's on the Autism spectrum and I think that might be part of his beliefs about not sweating.  But, I can't go one more day with him smelling like dirty genitals.  I've tried the gentle approach, tried the blunt approach, and nothing has worked.  Is there any way I can tell him that he smells without hurting his feelings?

I'm asking because it's been years and it's still happening, regardless of parent intervention.

TL;DR:  Autistic friend believes he's a superhuman that doesn't sweat and I'm sick of him stinking up my house when he visits."
79,"One of my (24 f) oldest male friends (26 m) cheated on his long-term gf (24 f) and I'm having trouble looking at him the same way.


I (24 f) have a really good guy friend (26 m) I've known since high school. Let's call him Tim. Tim had a long term girlfriend he dated over 2 years (24 f). Let's call her Lily. Tim and Lily had a pretty solid relationship. She was a really sweet girl. Me and my fiance (28 m) loved double dating with the two of them. I'm super close to Tim. I definitely consider him one of my best friends. 

A few weeks ago, Tim completely dropped off the face of the Earth. He wasn't answering my calls or texts. Then, he randomly re-surfaced and started making all these super depressing posts on Twitter that were filled with self-hatred. I texted him and asked him what was wrong. He confessed to me that sometime last year, he cheated on Lily with a random girl he met on social media. Eventually he couldn't handle the guilt, so he confessed his transgression to Lily. She immediately broke up with him, and wants absolutely nothing to do with him. 

To make the situation even worse, Lily's older sister is dating one of Tim's best friends from kindergarten. Tim's friend is so disgusted with him now he wants nothing to do with him as well. So, not only did Tim lose his girlfriend, he lost his childhood best friend. 

When Tim told me all this, I was pretty grossed out by his actions as well. Lily invested so much time and energy into their relationship. I can't imagine how she must be feeling. He threw so much away over a stupid hook up. It annoys me, and I'm having trouble feeling sorry whatsoever for him. 

He realizes how badly he messed up and completely hates himself. He texts me a lot at random times totally having a mental breakdown. I feel obligated to respond because I don't want him to do anything stupid, but deep down I'm really grossed out by this whole situation. I'm so tired of people falling into social media traps and being disloyal to their SOs. 

This whole incident has really changed my view of him. I feel slightly silly because the whole thing really isn't my business, but for some reason, I find myself questioning whether or not Tim is a good person. What he did was so grimy and out-of-the-blue. Has anyone else ever had a friend that did something along these lines that troubled you to this extent? I don't know how to reconcile my friendship with Tim with the fact that he made a really stupid, destructive decision that hurt a lot of people, including himself. 

TLDR: My best guy friend cheated on his girlfriend with some random social media girl, and I'm having trouble looking at him the same way.

80,"I refused my boyfriend's unsolicited help and he's shutting me down for days. Don't know what I did wrong. :/ ?


My BF (27) had helped me with my school work this summer and we fought 5 times in the past month over his teaching style and my learning skill. I did appreciate his help sometimes but after the 2nd fight over the same thing, I told him we should not do this together anymore and that I would just take care of it myself. In fact, it's my school work and I can ask him whenever I need his help but the thing is that he wants to walk me through from A to Z. He says he just tries to help and make sure I do not make mistakes. I said I don't mind making mistakes and if I do, that's a part of learning. I learn through those mistakes, I said. Then he insisted; I gave up and let him teach me. Another reason why I do not want him to tutor me is that he speaks in a very condescending tone. He also gets agitated so easily if I don't provide right answers or said ""I don't know or remember."" I get nervous and my brain starts to freeze around him every time he raises his voice. It has been so discouraging and demotivating that I told him that I want to give up and called it a night. Thing got awkward but things quickly became okay and I completed my assignment myself. It took more time without his help but I actually learn better myself. Three days ago, he asked me if I had finished my homework and said he wanted to help. I said it's okay and that I want to do it myself. He insisted and I resfectully turned down his offer a few more times. He would not quit. So I repeated the same thing that I told him in the past week. I told him I don't feel comfortable with the way he speaks to me and that it makes me nervous around him. He did not understand why. I told him (again) it's because of your discouraging and negative tone when speaking to me when teaching. Whenever he tutors me, he becomes makes comments, such as "" how many times did I tell you?"" "" how come you don't remember this?"" ""Come on, we just covered it earlier."" These comments does NOT help me remember anything. In fact, it works the other way around. He makes me feel that I can't figure things out on my own or he does not trust me to figure it out.

More importantly, I pointed out the number of same fights over and over again. I told him I really want to avoid the same fight. He replied, ""Avoidance is not a solution and it's not good for our relationship."" Then he said, he ""must help my schoolwork since we are a couple."" Since when your partner's education became couple's shared duty? All I want is a sense of independence and full control on my homework.

I asked him to carry a dining table on the same day. He replied, ""Obviously, you don't need my help."" That was the last word coming out of his mouth and he has been shutting me down since then. I feel like that he would not talk to me for days. I really want to understand what I did wrong and how to fix this awkward situation. Please advise!

**\*\* TL/DR \*\***

1. BF offered me unsolicited help for my homework;
2. I refused because I want to do it myself and avoid repeated fights over this;
3. He is mad and shutting me down for days."
81,"Update: My (20f) parents have decided to bring back my mentally ill suster (33f) out of rehab to come stay with them because they're convinced that they can heal her themselves

Hey it's me again, just needed more advice about stuff and to just update you on what's happening since major stuff happened like an hour ago and I don't know what to do anymore. I'm sorry if this sounds a bit ranty.

So after the first post, a lot of people suggested I move out (I was planning on it after graduation but a lot of you pushed for immediately). Anyway, a friend of mine was looking for a roommate so I asked her if she was still looking for roommates and houses and she said yes so we spent a few days after college calling a bunch of people and walking around the area looking for houses and asking around and stuff. 

It was a stupid thing to do, but I have no money so I asked my dad if he'd be willing to cover my side of the down payment and two months of rent till I get a job close to college where I'd be able to support myself. My family isn't in the best financial state right now, so he flat out said no and he told me he hadn't paid two months of my sister's rent when she was in rehab and he wanted to put her in a technical course and he needed money for that too so I was on my own. He never explicitly said he was ok with me leaving, but he was sure I wouldn't be able to anyway without the money and I was too.

I was talking about it with my ldr boyfriend and he offered to loan me the money that I'd need for my side of the rent for 2 months and the deposit. I was beyond ecstatic and I was really glad I'd finally be able to pay to move out. However, the problem was that I didn't know how to tell my parents that I was going to move out. They're usually very volatile people and sometimes I'm scared they'll throw the biggest fit if they don't get their way (they do that at home but I'm scared it'll happen in public). Plus they don't know I have a boyfriend so they'd be suspicious about where I'd gotten the money.

We found a house pretty close to college today and the landlady is very nice and even though the house isn't great, it's dirt cheap and we aren't incredibly picky. We're still deciding on it.

I was planning on telling my parents today about it. Specifically my dad because he's the more rational of the two (when my mom isn't around) and I was waiting to tell them in a way that wouldn't fuck up my relationship with them and where everyone would be (somewhat) happy.

So that's just to catch you up to today. Today, I came back home and when I went to my bathroom, there was blue paint and glitter floating around in the kommode. I immediately knew it was my sister and I went downstairs to ask her why she did it. She gave me some bullshit about how it's easier to clean paintbrushes there than in the sink. I told her this was just like the last time (before she went to rehab she emptied bottles of my paints and ink into buckets filled with water and soaked a bunch of her clothes in it and stained the walls). She asked me what the fuck I was talking about (I assume she presumably forgot about all of her fucking shenanigans from last time). She then went on to tell my mother about I have a huge problem with her and how she feels like I don't want her at home (no shit). Then she told me to fucking grow up because she didn't have her own room when she was my age and how I'm so pampered and all that jazz and I told her that I'm not her and long story short that I don't see why I should share a room with a 35 year old woman (see note at end). I basically told her how she can conveniently forget all the bad shit she does and how my parents can look past it but I have to deal with all this bullshit and she told me to grow up again for some reason (because apparently standing up for yourself is childish, especially coming from a grown woman who everybody regards as sane and whose diet consists of 50% chocolate and candy). The whole time this is happening, my sister is sitting on the couch, I'm standing on the stairs about to go to my room and my mum is between the two of us yelling at us to stop yelling.

I lose it at this point and basically tell my mom that I'm leaving and that by this time next week I'll be gone. She starts chasing me up the stairs and tells me that no one leaves this house and that no one has permission to leave their house and everyone has to say until they say so and I tell her that I'm legally an adult and that I have every right to leave (again see note at end). Anyway while all this happens, I get to my room and shut the door in her face and tell her that I see no reason as to why I should be forced to live with their bad decisions and she calls me a coward for closing the door and yelling at her. I open the door and throw the money she had give me earlier at her face and shut the door again. 

Now I'm just sitting here and I don't know what to do and where to go from here. I fucked up really bad and I just don't know how I'm going to move without my parents showing up and making a big scene. My landlady is pretty conservative too and she wants to meet my parents and I can't risk having them come there and cause a scene and basically having me kicked out of there because my landlady will obviously take my parents side. I don't know what to do. My only support system at this point is my boyfriend and I feel so alone.

Note: I know all of this could have been handled way better than I did. I was stressed and tired and the only reason I went downstairs at all was to get something for a migraine. I know this isn't any reason for behaving the way that I did, but I'm at my wits end and I've just given up.

Tl;Dr: found houses and roommate and money to move out pretty much immediately. Tried to tell parents in a way that would make them not mad because I don't want to go NC. Sister pulls her dumb shit again and I lose it and she loses it and in my rage I tell them that I'm leaving and they get mad. Don't know how to move out without them causing a scene and getting me kicked out by landlady."
82,"My mom invited my ex [21M] and his family to our private family dinner that I [20F] invited my boyfriend [24M] to.


I'm still fuming atm so I'm sorry if this post turns more into a rant than a description of events. 

Some background: I have a super strict and traditional Asian mother. If I were 16 again, I would've definitely ranted about her on  r / raisedbynarcissists. Anyway, she's pressured me into things my entire life and I don't even want to get into specifics. Also, there's been verbal and slight physical abuse my entire life. Things have gotten better after I went off the college but I stayed close to home which means I see her often (I go back every weekend). 

She pays for my college tuition. My dad travels a lot due to his job so he's basically never home but he's definitely a lot better than my mom. 

I started dating my ex my freshman year of college but he actually went high school with me too. My mom absolutely loves him. He's ""very tall and handsome Asian boy"" from a rich Asian family who's pursuing medicine. My mom was absolutely delighted when I introduced him. She welcomed him into our family almost immediately and befriended his entire family. About a year into our relationship, we ran into some issues and because of those issues, I began to fall out of love with him so I ended it. I told my mom this and she was devastated, she even cried. She actually thought that he would be the one and I would end up marrying him. She also blamed me for not making it work. UGH.

I was single for about half a year and during that entire time, she was trying to get us back together. She tried everything from planning double family outings, to calling him (Idek how she managed to get his number) and telling him that I missed him and still loved him but didn't have the courage to call him. I got a phone call from him and imagine my embarrassment and shock when he asked me if I wanted to get back together. WTF MOM.

I met my current boyfriend my sophomore year and we've been together about half a year. My mom refuses to meet him. Why? Because he's white and not Asian. She's always wanted me to marry an Asian guy. I think it's mainly because she dislikes the cultural disconnect and awkwardness that could result from me being with someone from another race. Funny thing is, my boyfriend is literally everything my mom likes, if not better. He's in med school but majored in CS &amp; Engineering (she's always wanted me to marry a guy who does both engineering and medicine), comes from a respected and rich family, and is tall and handsome. She hasn't even met him but has already decided she hates him. 

I literally begged her to just give him a chance and meet him because I thought that if they could meet, she'd like him. I finally get her to agree to let him come to dinner at our house after I blew up at her calling her racist and unreasonable. We had a huge fight but in the end, she relented. It just so happened my dad was home at the time too and I knew that my dad would be welcoming and balance my mom out. 

The night of, my boyfriend and I get dressed up and he even baked a Chinese dessert to bring. Right after we stepped inside, I saw my ex and his mom and dad sitting in our living room. I think I said WTF out loud. Then my mom comes rushing over to us and with a fake ass smile tells us that they ""dropped by to say hello but since we're all having dinner, I just invited them to join us"". BULLSHIT. I just shook my head at her. My boyfriend had no idea what was up so he went around introducing himself. I felt so fucking bad and angry at the same time. I might've been thinking irrationally but I walked up to my dad, told him that mom is absolutely out of her fucking mind and that I would never talk to her again. I then just grabbed my boyfriend and told him that we're leaving and I led him straight out the fucking door and back into our car where I cried as he drove us back to his place. I told him the truth and he didn't take it to well. I guess he just didn't understand. He was pretty upset but didn't blame me and said that what my mom did was pretty fucked up, to which I wholeheartedly agreed. We ended up ordering some food and just chilling at his place.

After I got him this morning, I'd gotten like 20 calls from my mom and dad, a series of angry texts from my mom blaming me for leaving and being a disrespectful ""prostitute"" and shaming me for embarrassing her in front of her guests, and two calls from my ex. I haven't responded to a single one but I really want to respond to my mom. I am still so so so angry. How could she do this?? Who in their right mind does this type of fucked up shit?!?!

Now I'm worried that me and my boyfriend's relationship is fucked. Is there anything else I could say to him to remedy this whole ordeal? What should I even do about my mom? What should I say in my response? I don't want to resort to derogatory insults but that really seems appealing right now. 

TL;DR: Racist Asian mother disapproves of my white boyfriend. When she finally agreed to meet him at a family dinner, she ended up inviting my ex, who she loves and is Asian, and his family to the dinner. Bf and I walked out but he was pretty freaked. I don't know what I should even do about my mom and now I'm worried that this is a deal breaker for my bf.
