0,"UPDATE: My [26F] boyfriend's [25M] friends [20s Ms] keep telling him to break up with me while I'm grieving my mother's death.


Original post:  [https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/aqcc5k/my\_26f\_boyfriends\_25m\_friends\_20s\_ms\_keep\_telling/](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/aqcc5k/my_26f_boyfriends_25m_friends_20s_ms_keep_telling/) 

My post didn't get very much attention, but I thought I'd post an update anyway because I like them so much.  I'm also hoping it might be therapeutic to write this out.

I did break up with my boyfriend, albeit not immediately after Reddit resoundingly told me to.  A lot of people were saying to me that by doing this to me (especially at this time), Andrew was expressing a lack of commitment to me and consideration for me.  I think part of me knew that as soon as it happened, but I just wasn't ready to accept it yet.

We ended up staying together after the incident I described in my post, partially because he apologized profusely and reassured me, but mostly because I had just lost my mom and I wasn't ready to lose him too.  I don't regret staying with him these past few months; he's provided me a lot of support that I would have been to afraid to ask for from anyone else in my life.  But as time went on, his lack of consideration for my feelings and our clear incompatibility continued to resurface.  We talked about breaking up a couple times, and I finally decided to pull the plug last night.  Unsurprisingly, he was pretty relieved.  He admitted that he has wanted this for awhile, but has ""wronged"" me so many times in our relationship that he felt an obligation to ""do right by me"" and not end things until I was ready.  

It's hard to take this kind of loss while I'm still dealing with the loss of my mother, but I know it's for the better.  Thanks for the advice, Reddit.  

**TL;DR: We finally broke up.**"
1,"My [23f] ex [22m] posted a long ""apology"" detailing his behavior on facebook, now I feel like my relationships with my current boyfriend [24m] and family are deteriorating and I don't know what to do


\*tl;dr\* my ex boyfriend posted about how he abused me on Facebook as an ""apology,"" my family is pressuring me to forgive him and my boyfriend wants to confront him, I feel like no one is listening to me. What do I do?

My ex boyfriend and I were together for 4 years on and off in a very volatile and violent relationship. I struggled with my self esteem and kept going back to him. I spent about 2 years single and in therapy until I met my current boyfriend, who is not at all like my former boyfriend.

My ex likes to reach out and try to reconcile once every few months. I've blocked him, but he makes new emails and phone numbers to reach out again. He hasn't done anything in a long time that the police care about, so I have no legal remedies. 

I guess after 3 years apart, my ex realized that I am not going to come back to him and went for a last ditch effort by making an ""accountability"" post on facebook, where he detailed the abuse and manipulation for everyone to read. He didn't name me, but anyone who knows him or me knows it's about me. He framed it as holding himself accountable and making a public apology so that everyone can see that he messed up and he's owning up to it.

At this point, my family, friends, and boyfriend have all seen the post, either on my ex's page or being shared, because some of his friends are sharing it and praising him for being open about his past ""mistakes."" 

I still hold anger for some of the things that happened then (anger which, for the record, my therapist says is healthy and ok) and I just don't feel comfortable with ""forgiving"" my ex, and I never will. It doesn't consume me or anything, but I just need to hold him accountable mentally. Not here to debate that.

Anyway, my family and friends are pushing me to forgive him and see the good in him because he owned up to his behavior. They want me to reach out and tell him I forgive him but I don't want him around to give him closure. They keep pressuring me no matter how many times I tell them no. They talk about it with me all the time.

On the other hand, my boyfriend is really furious. He tried reporting the post to facebook, as did a bunch of my friends, but facebook won't take it down because he didn't mention me by name. Now he wants to go to my ex's house and tell him face to face to take it down, or at least he wants to contact my ex and tell him to take it down so I don't have to contact him. I feel like I'm constantly talking my boyfriend down.

From my perspective, all of these reactions seem like what my ex wants. I think he wants me to contact him and that's why he did this. I keep telling my family and boyfriend to ignore it and not add fuel to the fire, but no one will listen. Everyone wants to share their opinion on the situation and tell me how to handle it, and I feel like no one is respecting my perspective. This upsets me even more because I think that I am the most experienced with how to deal with the person that I was with for 4 years.

I am not looking for advice on how to move on from anger or abuse or anything like that. I'm just here to ask: how do I convey to my family and boyfriend that they are not helping? How do I let them know that I value their opinions and I know they care, but they're making it worse? I don't want them to feel attacked, but I want them to listen to me. How do I navigate this situation with the people who I love and who love me but who are handling this in a really unhelpful way?"
2,"UPDATE: I've [M26] decided to break up with my fiancé [F26] of 8 years. Need advice on how to proceed.


Link to original post https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/bylrpo/ive_m26_decided_to_break_up_with_my_fiancé_f26/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share

I appreciate all of the advice on my last post. i didn't expect to get so much attention on it. But things went about as expected. She cried, I cried, she begged. It wasn't pretty. But for two weeks we've been broken up and she moved out today. The first few days were aweful. But afterwards we were able to talk to each other like normal people. And I helped her with everything I could. I let her take the room while I slept on the couch so she could have space and I tried to make myself as scarce as possible.

It's been a sad time and a sigh of relief. She also admitted to me that the reason she never tried to fix anything was because she didn't believe I would ever actually break up with her. She apologized and promised to work on herself. Which I appreciate. I told her there wasn't a chance we could get back together. We just aren't right. And she even said she is willing to try being friends after a while and I told her she is free to talk to me anytime but I won't bother her while she is getting over things.

I'm going to have to work things out properly with my financial status. But this is all for the best and I'm glad It happened. I only wish I could have done it earlier.

Thanks again for the advice. It helped a ton.

TL:DR I went through with the breakup and we are both doing fine now. Thank you for your help."
3,"Husband ignored my mom's emergency call for help, has sabotaged every mourning event since she died.


It's long - I'm angry and verbose. TL;DR! Husband has done some egregious things with regard to my mother in the last year which I believe are unforgivable. I think he is unaware of how disgusting his behavior has been. I asked him to go to counseling to talk about things because I don't think I can talk directly to him without screaming at him. We have now moved into initiating a divorce, and he still does not know what he did. I need him to know how awful he was, but have no idea how to approach it, if we are skipping counseling and moving straight to divorce. 

&amp;#x200B;

 My (42F) mom (73F) passed away two months ago.  Last year she decided she could not live alone any more, and was looking into assisted living. She had a long term illness but was not close to death. I expected we would have 5 years at least. My husband (43M married 7 years) and I offered her the lower level of our home so that she could be with her grand kids and near my sister.  He told me he never believed she would agree to come to live at our house. She did. 

&amp;#x200B;

My mom moves in and things are OK at first. She was mentally all there, but severely limited physically. She spent most of her time in the house and had a to-do list for me every day when I got home from work, even though my husband was home after 2pm. He would not go speak to her at all. The only thing he would do is ask her if she was coming upstairs for dinner. My kids would go down and play with her and she liked that. 

&amp;#x200B;

About 4 weeks after she moved in, she got the flu and ended up in the ICU for 10 days. They had us making phone calls at 3AM telling family she was going to die. They told us if she survived, she would have brain damage. I slept at the hospital for 2 days. She survived and was able to come home. She had more needs than before but my husband still would not talk to her. When I asked him to help, he said he was busy with the kids and was tired. Note for the record - I was also tired.

&amp;#x200B;

She lived with us for five more months, hospitalized 4 more times before she passed. 

&amp;#x200B;

Here is the event that is sticking with me, and I don't know what to deal with: We had installed emergency buttons in her space in case she needed help right away. It rings a doorbell upstairs. She used one the night she went to the hospital the first time. This happened on a different day. On this occasion it was the middle of the day on the weekend. My husband was taking a nap. I was doing laundry, kids were playing in the living room. My mom was having trouble breathing, needed to go to the hospital, and rang her bell. Our laundry is in the garage, so I did not hear it. My three-year old shouted to me, but I could not hear her, and my kids shout to me a lot, and I told her I would answer her in a few minutes. I was in the garage for another 3-5 minutes when I went inside and asked my daughter what she needed. She said she heard Grandma's bell, and that is when I learned about it. Husband told me later that he heard the bell, but knew I was around, so ignored it, and went back to sleep. I told him I expected him to answer EVERY TIME she rang the bell, and we left it at that. He did not apologize. I couldn't process it at the time because I was caring for my mom, my kids, and still going to work. I've been able to process it and I am so angry at him and he doesn't know why. He doesn't think he did anything wrong. There are more events after this that he doesn't know how awful he was. 

&amp;#x200B;

Months later she dies. The night before we took her to the hospital I was reading to my kids for bedtime and I don't bring my phone in with me when I read to them. He was parked in front of his computer. She texted both of us saying she thought she needed to go to the hospital. He told me he did not hear/notice the message. I was in with my kids so didn't see it for another half an hour. I don't know at this point if I believe he did not see it. 

&amp;#x200B;

She died in the hospital 3 days after that message. On a Tuesday. We had been scheduled to have our nephew (his brother's son) for the weekend, Easter weekend. It was to give nephew's parents a chance to get ready to move to a new house. He's a great kid and before mom died I had no problem having him for the weekend. His parents have tough schedules and it is actually very hard for them to get a weekend off together. 

&amp;#x200B;

So he came Friday night and the overnights were a clusterfuck. My kids had just lost their grandma and my nephew is going nuts with all my kids toys and it is awful. They did not sleep until midnight. On Easter Sunday, my sister and I had decided to do Easter because my mom had made baskets for all the kids and had filled eggs for an egg hunt and was really looking forward to it. So we had my sister's family over and did the egg hunt and the kids loved it, but it was very hard, since we had it in her space. My husband was supposed to take nephew home around noon, but did not. I kept asking him to take him home, but he told me he wanted to give his brother as much time as possible, and did not take him home until after dinner. Every hour was excruciating when I just wanted to cry in private and could not get a moment's peace.

&amp;#x200B;

Later that week, my husband's step-mother asked me why we had had my nephew over when the whole family (3 households) had offered to take him after my mom died. My husband told everyone that no - we said we would take him and so we would take him.  He did not even ask me. I told him I was disappointed that his brother was his priority on the week my mother died. He did not respond at the time, but told me later that he was following my lead (AKA - ALL MY FAULT) because we hadn't cancelled Easter. When I pointed out that it was all my mom's plan and my sister and her daughter had just lost their mom/grandma, so we were celebrating my mom - he said he got that now but did not get it then. 

&amp;#x200B;

Two weeks later we had my mom's funeral. We had family (4 adults) coming in who would be staying with us in my mom's space. We had drama with another family member who were rude while my mom was sick which didn't affect anything except stress levels. Emotions were high. I had had to meet with the pastor and help plan the service, help notify all the family, and help my kids work through their grief and answer questions about death. Our neighbors down the street were VERY pregnant, with a scheduled induction the day of the funeral. He offered to take their oldest child for a sleepover, even though their parents were in town, and we have a neighborhood full of friendly houses who would take him if they were at the hospital. I asked him directly why he would invite another kid to the house when I had told him specifically how hurtful that was to me before. He said he did not really think they would ask us to take them (so it was an empty offer). He did not apologize to me, he did not offer to make other arrangements. I had to tell him directly that he needed to change it, and that it would not be OK to have another kid there. He did make other arrangements. 

&amp;#x200B;

His mom attended the funeral, and had a serious health event during. She ended up spending the night at our very full house. She slept in our bed, I slept in a recliner, and my husband slept on the couch. I had planned to take the next day off work to take care of myself. He asked me to take care of his mom that day, since I would be home, instead of him taking a day off to care for his own mom. I had been on a leave of absence from work, and had taken a great deal of time off to take care of my mom. It infuriates me that he could not take one goddamned day to care for his own mother and to allow me to care for myself. I took care of his mom. 

&amp;#x200B;

Mother's day was three weeks after my mom died. It was a hard day for me. I was crying a lot. He planned nothing except to take kids shopping for presents (after he tried to make plans with other kids that day and I reminded him it was mother's day). The kids wanted to make me breakfast in bed which he helped them with. All morning he kept asking me well what do you want to do? What do you want to do? (for mother's day). I was broken down crying and my kids were asking me what was so upsetting and I talked to them about their grandma. I told him (crying) that I was upset that he had not hugged or kissed me at all that day. He didn't answer. I was crying more and said ""really? Nothing??"" and he patted me on the shoulder. I took the kids out of the house for the rest of the day. Later he apologized but told me I had not been affectionate with him recently (WHILE MY MOM WAS DYING) and so he didn't feel comfortable. (AKA-ALL MY FAULT)

&amp;#x200B;

He has done nothing to help deal with my mom's estate. I am a co-executor and have to deal with financial accounts, but he could make phone calls to cancel credit cards, deal with her health equipment, dispose of her meds - or even just fucking get the mail, which he also does not do. I have told him I am overwhelmed with the work and he offers nothing. I have asked him to do minimal tasks like putting the car tabs on the car, which he could not manage and I had to do. 

&amp;#x200B;

A few weeks after she died was her birthday. We had a party for her to celebrate her so that our kids could have something positive about her where none of their grownups are crying. My husband hates my sister and her husband. It was at my house, so I told him he could just be upstairs and not join in. He asked if I would prefer it that way, and I said yes. Note that he has told me directly that he hates them and refuses to go to their home at this point. His reason is stupid, IMO, and it broke my sister when she figured it out. During the party the kids asked if he would play with him and he told them I would be angry with him if he did, so he couldn't play with them. I sent them up with a plate of appetizers, which he rejected. I sent a kid up to ask if he wanted a plate of food for dinner because he had been upstairs all day. He sent me a text telling me not to involve the kids in this - I told him (via text) he was the one who told them I would be angry if he played with them and all I did was offer him food. Anyway lots of texts back and forth and we end up in a screaming match. I had had drinks. I was screaming at him that he hated my mom and wanted her dead and hated my family and was awful. He screamed that he wanted a divorce. 

&amp;#x200B;

He emailed later to apologize for ruining the day. I am fucking done with him and told him I would work with a mediator to split assets and make a parenting plan. He told me he would 'let me schedule it' to work with my schedule. So now I'm in charge of the fucking divorce, too. I have an appointment with an attorney in a couple weeks. I'm so fucking angry knowing that I will end up doing 90% of the work to sell/pack our house. If I want out I need to do it, but I'm still dealing with my mom's estate, and STILL GRIEVING. Also way behind at work because I took so much time out. He's a teacher and has only one class all summer. He is staying home with kids. He is so fucking lazy and won't do anything. 

&amp;#x200B;

He still brings up what a great thing we did by letting my mom move in. He is really proud of himself. He thinks he is amazing. He doesn't know he did almost fucking nothing. I don't know how to communicate this to him without drunken screaming or a counselor present. I'm not working on the marriage, he is unforgivable, but he needs to know. How do I communicate this while we need to work together to get through the divorce, and need to co-parent for at least 14 more years?"
4,"UPDATE: Me [26F] with my boyfriend [34M] of 2 years, I feel very guilty about possibly moving us for my career


Original post: [https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/8a92r3/me\_26f\_with\_my\_boyfriend\_34m\_of\_2\_years\_i\_feel/](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/8a92r3/me_26f_with_my_boyfriend_34m_of_2_years_i_feel/)

&amp;#x200B;

Several months after I made this post, I made the final decision to apply to postdoc positions all across the US.  I received many great offers and decided to move several states away to work with a well known PI in my field whom my advisors greatly respect.  After enduring a couple months of long distance and uncertainty, we learned today that my (now) fiance got his dream job in the city I moved to.  Not only does he get to remain a government employee, but his salary is also significantly higher than what he was making before.

&amp;#x200B;

Thank you so much for all your encouragement and replies.  It gave me the push I really needed to take that dive to move cross country for a new job.  In the end, it really paid off and we finally get to move on with the rest of our lives together.

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR I decided to take Reddit's advice to take a job in another state.  My now fiance found his dream job there and will be following me down to the city I currently live in."
5,"My family expects me (30F) to leave my family (and small child) indefinitely and move across county to care for my mother (66F), and I don’t know how to react. No expectations fall to my drug-addicted (36M) brother.


My mother is disabled due to a neurological illness. She was diagnosed in her late thirties and I remember her mostly as being sick and needing help. I used to really look up to her as super-mom who could overcome any obstacle. That was until my father died. My father passed over a decade ago while I was still in high school. My brother (36M) and I lived with my parents at the time.  I got a job while in high school after he passed, cleaned the house, mowed the grass, bought food with money from my job, paid bills when I could (minimum wage isn’t much), and made dinner most nights for my mom and me. My brother was rarely in the home unless to sleep or because he wanted money. 

Over the years, my brother has been in and out of prison dozens and dozens of times for everything from drunk driving to drug possession to stealing from our mother to assault. He is currently incarcerated. No one mentions him or expects anything of him, except my mother who, in violation of a court order for her own protection that she herself asked for, sends him money and speaks to him weekly as well as sends letters. 

Back to my father’s death (a seven month bout with illness). 

Nearly two years after my father passed. I graduated high school and left for college out of state. I would send my mom money while in college and I distinctly remember, for instance, using my stipend I received in December to buy my mother and brother Christmas gifts because I knew they wouldn’t have anything if I didn’t. No one reciprocated, but I didn’t expect it. Honestly, I didn’t care either until it became a pattern over the next decade. That particular Christmas, barely 18 years old, and I was scraping together pennies to buy a cheap fridge after I came home on winter break with gifts only to realize there was no food in the house.  My brother, in a drug-fueled rage, tore down the Christmas tree I had bought and decorated and threatened to kill himself unless I gave him money because “no one loved him” and it would prove that I “cared.” It is important to note even at this time my mother continued to let my now-felon brother back into home. 

I’ll try to skip through the college and graduate studies years but suffice it to say I met my now-husband and I spent less and less time at home. When I was home or when my husband and I visited, it was as follows: clean my mom’s home, buy my mom food, cook for my mom, take care of my mom. I was and remain very clear with my mother that I will not let my brother into my life as he has threatened to kill me (over prescription cough syrup!), thrown me down my stairs, and broken down a door to get at me (and the little bit of cash I had on me at the time). I have no doubt he would try to hurt my child, my husband, or me to get what he wants. He has told me he will find me and he “get me” for his perception that I have wronged him (for not giving him money), and I have ZERO contact with him. I have blocked all numbers that have any correlation to him including friends he has call from outside prison. Note: My mother let him get my number off her phone. 

I have told me mother for years that I cannot have my brother in my life until he at least goes one year drug-free. To date, he’s been unable to do so. He has stolen tens of thousands of dollars from her. She always says she won’t let him back in her house, but she in the end forgives him and the cycle repeats. Next year, when he’s released again, she has told me under no uncertain terms that he won’t live with her but she admits she remains in contact, sends him money, and thinks this is “the Devil” in him that makes him a drug-addict. He will move back in. 

I have offered to help my mom move closer to me as I live many states away. My husband and I even had a realtor come out and start the process of listing our home so we could find a home with space for my mom. My only condition was that she not bring my brother into my son’s life. She has adamantly refused same. She has also refused to look at assisted living facilities, even though I reached out on my own accord and found great recommendations from her doctors.

Now that she had surgery this week, I have had family come out of the woodwork. Honestly, I am resentful of this. I’ve had people who can’t even send me a reciprocal Christmas card tell me that I am “neglecting” my mother by refusing to take time off work and travel to her to take care of her. They do not care that I don’t have the vacation days and would likely lose my job. One even stated that “I wouldn’t care about putting groceries on my table. I wouldn’t work for an employer like that.” Easy words to say; tell that to my hungry toddler. They have said, “Who do you think cared for you as a baby?” and, honestly this one gets to me, “Sometimes you have to learn to deal with life. You can’t just ignore it.”—because “dealing with life” includes losing my job, moving away from my toddler in his formative years, and caring for my mother, I guess? 

You can probably tell at this point that I am fed up. I am in a no win position where literally the ONLY surviving family members are telling me to leave my job, my family, my small child, to come care for my mom and help her. They also refuse to put a timeframe on this; it would be “as long as she needed.” I am expected to care for her 24/7, no questions asked. I also strongly feel like they are taking their own resentment at my mother asking them for favors out on me, though I have explained multiple times that I offered for her to stay with us and have the surgery here (at no cost to her, mind you) and she declined. They tell me in response she has a “right to be near her friends.” I have also tried to explain that by bending down to her every beck and call, they are enabling her, but they don’t want to hear it. They do not seem to hear me when I try to explain that, for example, helping her check out of physical therapy facility a week and a half before her doctor’s recommendation, is enabling her and in the long run, not good for her independence. She has grown accustomed to everyone doing everything for her (example, on this past visit, she got very upset with me for not taking her to Wal-Mart because she had to go there at nearly the toddler’s bedtime. This wasn’t an emergency. She wanted to “look around.”). 

My mother in all of this mess has taken the position that although she doesn’t “want me to lose my job,” a good daughter should care for her mother. I honestly have a lot of animosity toward this proclamation because my mother has not, since before my father died, called me on my birthday; tried to establish any relationship with my son (I am always the one trying to get them to FaceTime or speak on the phone); and in the last twelve years, I can count on one hand the number of times she has called me just to check in on me or my son or ask how we are doing. If she does reach or and contact, there is always an ulterior motive (money for my brother or for her because she’s given my brother everything). 

I am at my breaking point. 

I can’t work full-time, care for my family, and also be expected to hear multiple times a week how I am a shitty person for refusing to abandon everything I have worked so hard for to care for my mother. Despite everything, I love my mom. My husband and his family have all seen this unfold and multiple people have remarked “Why do you even try anymore?” (meaning try to schedule calls to allow her to talk to / see my son). I invited her to my home earlier this month, scheduled the plane tickets, assistance though airport, etc., only to watch her play on her phone or spend time playing fetch with her dog rather than read a book to my toddler, who just wanted her attention. 

Today, as if a final straw was needed, I called to check in on her and she proclaimed she was going home against doctor’s orders because her dog NEEDS her because the dog is sick. First of all, he has a very minor skin condition that is nearly 100% resolved thanks to her friend  giving him the prescribed ointment. Secondly, my toddler got sick this week (meaning out of daycare for three days sick), and even after I told her of same, she never once called to check on him, just like she never called to check on him when he got the Flu last year, or when he had a mysterious week-and-a-half long illness earlier this year that resulted in four doctor’s appointments and a 104 degree temperature.

I can’t stand it anymore. I am literally writing this as a last resort. My husband is saying to go no contact with everyone (this is ALL the family I have left, except one aunt on my father’s side) because he sees me crying when the hurtful comments role in and the guilt trips. He sees me trying to hide it from my child. But then I feel like I am giving them what they want, right? Look at LittleMissPotatoe, such a crappy human being and so inept at “dealing with life,” she just chose to ignore all of us. But I can’t spend my days defending myself to extended family members I have seen in over a decade or, in some cases, over two decades. 

Nothing I say is good enough. And nothing I say ever
will be. 

TL;DR: I have been told in no uncertain terms that I am a horrible person for refusing to abandon my husband and small child and move across county for care for my mother."
6,"I (20F) found a blog post by my sister (23F) written about me. She says I am a terrible person and all this other horrible stuff. I had no idea she thought of me this way, and I don't know how to confront her about this.


My sister has always been sort of the 'good' one of the family. She got amazing grades, she never partied, she works very hard at her career and is very responsible. I wasn't necessarily the bad one, I never did anything too bad, but I was never quite as 'good' as my sister. The worst I ever did really was smoke pot a bit and go to parties and stuff. Even my parents weren't too weirded out by any of that, but regardless, my sister always frowned upon it.I got a 87 average graduating high school (I think that is like a 3.4 GPA? not even sure), and in college right now my GPA is a 3.2. I go to the same college my sister went to, although she graduated already.  I knew that she absolutely despised the 'cool' kids at school, and while I was never one of them, I still would sometimes go to their parties and such. She didn't despise them because of jealousy, she hated them because she thought they were reckless and irresponsible and would end up fucking up their lives. There were always big kind of social gaps between us. I went through a scene kid phase, she never really stopped being anything but a more preppy girl. I bleached my hair and got piercings and wore a leather jacket in college, she mostly wore more normal clothes. But she never really commented on any of that. 

&amp;#x200B;

Anyways, we live together. Her computer broke, so she used my dads computer. I use my dads computer to play video games sometimes (my laptop barely even has a video card lol), and when I went on, I noticed she had tabs open. One of them was to a blog post. I started reading it, and soon enough, I realized this was FROM HER. She was writing it. It was her ranting about her job, which I thought funny. I probably shouldn't have read more, but I couldn't resist. It seemed incredibly harmless, she was just complaining that her office had ugly wallpaper and that her coworkers wore ugly clothes. Then I skimmed down and there was stuff written about me. Horrible stuff, like really insulting stuff that she has never said to my face. She said I was going to end up a drug addict, that I could never get my life together, that whenever faced with any form of challenge I make excuses, that I probably slept with half of my college by now (no, not at all). It was like 3-4 paragraphs of ranting, making me out to be some kind of wrecking ball of a girl. She even ranted about me getting a tattoo. A tattoo of my dog, on my shoulder. Literally the smallest, most harmless tattoo imaginable. She also said I let guys treat me like shit, and that every relationship I have been in has been with some asshole. Okay, half true. But still, the way she wrote it made it seem as I was responsible for that somehow, that the only men I attract are assholes because that is 'what I deserve, with the way I am'. She said that I never respected our parents and never cared about advancing my life, that I was a waste of space. It was horrible. I just felt this terrible feeling in my gut, 

&amp;#x200B;

I was just astounded at what she wrote. I always knew she kind of shook her head at my previous shenanigans but I never knew she truly detested me like this and viewed me as some kind of... bad person? I don't even know the word to use. We don't exactly talk that much really. I mean, sometimes, but in general she was always busy. When we did talk though I never got the vibe that she hated me, we sometimes joked around and laughed. Its just so weird and hurtful to hear this. I don't even want to live in the same house as her, I feel disgusted. 

&amp;#x200B;

How do I bring this up? Do I bring this up? Is it even worth it? I feel almost like all of the previous things I have ever had with her have always been some sort of facade she put on now. 

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR - - I found a blog post written by my sister saying I am a terrible person."
7,"My wife [24F] told her friends that she wouldn’t care if I [26M] cheated on her.


My wife and I have been married for 3 years. We have a 2 year old daughter and another one on the way.  We have been together for a total of 6 years. We are each others best friends. I truly believe that she is my soulmate. She also always tells me that she loves me.

I have never so much as flirted with another woman while we were together. No other woman measures up to her. I would certainly never cheat on her.

I travel a lot for my living though, and my coworkers are not the most faithful guys. A lot of them are having affairs. Gossip spreads and my wife knows about their reputations as well. I never thought she’d lump me together with them.

Yesterday she was talking with her friends. I heard a commotion and realized one of her friends was crying. I was in my office but I wanted to know what was happening, so I leaned against the wall to listen. 

This friend of hers was telling my wife that she suspected her fiancee of cheating on her. My wife comforted her and said “I’m pretty sure my husband is cheating on me too. I wouldn’t even care if that was the case, because its so common.” She then said that unfortunately men are “biologically” unable to remain monogamous. Then she told her friend not to worry and just talk to her fiancee upfront and try to get to the bottom of it. After, the friends left.

I told my wife later that I heard their convo. I told her it was untrue and hurtful of her to assume that I would cheat on her, and perhaps the worst thing is that she admitted she wouldn’t care if I did. I asked her if she really loved me. She just laughed and said I need to relax and stop overreacting. Am I reading more into this than I should? I don’t know when she started being so oddly cynical. Could it be due to pregnancy hormones? 

TL;DR: Wife told friend she wouldn’t care if I cheated on her."
8,"Me (25M) and best friend (28F) recently slept together, now causing huge issues and tension, no clue what to do


 Repost as removed as broke a rule in error - apologies!

Throwaway for obvious reasons. First things first this may be long and windy, I hope it all makes sense but I think just typing it out and getting it off my chest will help massively anyway. I need some advice on what I can do here and where I go - i need to keep my friend.

&amp;#x200B;

I met her two years ago when we worked together and quickly became very close. She helped me through the darkest times of my life (i was mid split with an abusive ex when we met), and I helped her through some really tough and unimaginable things. There were lots of rumours at the time we were seeing each other and everyone assumed we were an item, but for the past two years our relationship has been purely platonic - she is (was?) my best friend and up until a few weeks back I don't think we'd even ever hugged.

&amp;#x200B;

Fast forward to a week ago - she came over for dinner and wine, this is very common and normal. We had more than usual and she was over the limit so couldn't drive, so she stayed the night. We slept in the same bed but apart and no physical contact again, it was completely normal and just as expected. We somehow didn't get up and ended up staying in bed until 10pm the next day just talking. Sometime during that evening she got upset about something going on in her life, I rubbed her back while telling her everything will be ok and then we just cuddled - probably the first bit of real physical contact between us but nothing was sexual, didn't feel weird and she went home and it was all OK.

&amp;#x200B;

This last weekend we had a hiking holiday planned, where we'd be sleeping in her van (she has a converted transit). It's one bed but we thought we'd be fine. First night it was freezing, ending up cuddling and spooning but again didn't feel sexual. Second night is where it all went a bit wrong, we drank a bit too much and the spoon ended up getting carried away - it seems to be a joint thing and before I knew it we were kissing and touching each other everywhere. It was a bit of a frenzy of this for about 15 minutes until we both stopped and realised what we just did. After this we spoke a little and asked if either of us regretted it, we both said we didn't but it was odd. She got upset and I told her it was ok - it didn't change anything and we could just draw a line under it. We woke up the next morning and it happened again, we didn't talk too much but then went for a walk and then just before we headed home we ended up all over each other again, we were completely naked but again stopped, cuddled and lay there. We both agreed it was a ""what happens in X, stays in X"" type event.

&amp;#x200B;

It was a really long trip home (6 hours+), during this she would rest her head on my, hand on lap ect and it seemed very different to our usual dynamic. When we stopped at services for breaks we seemed to walk arm in arm, we kept kissing on and off but it seems strangely normal? We arrived back at her home, she lives with her dad at the moment but just before I left she kissed me again and thanked me for a wonderful weekend.

&amp;#x200B;

The following day (two days ago) she came over to get some stuff I took home with me, we end up just cuddling, kissing, feeling and so on again. We are on my bed and dry humping but she has dinner with a friend and we stop it there, she goes on her way. Two days later she comes over for a film and food - we had a lovely night, she ends up staying and we end up having sex twice. This should feel really weird and strange, but it felt completely normal and we both discussed it that it was so odd it felt normal.

&amp;#x200B;

Yesterday she turned up unannounced at my place (which is not a normal thing) with coffee and doughnuts, we end up talking, cuddling, kissing again and then we end up talking about what this is - que the big problem. Neither of us were sure, she got panicky and burst out in tears and left. She said she was really scared and her words were ""I think I will end up pushing you away and hurting you and I don't want to do that to you"". I told her I would come and see her later and talk. I drove to her house but her ex was there, another slight issue. They broke up 6 years ago stayed close friends, he is a lovely bloke but in his head he is certain they will get married and have children. She's had the conversation with him but he seems to shut it off. If he found out she was seeing anyone he would get extremely angry, but there's so much family history intertwined between the both it's really complicated. For that reason she has avoided seeing anyone in the past 6 years. The reason he turned up is she hadn't responded to him since the night we kissed. I went home when I saw his car and just said she could come to mine to chat later.

&amp;#x200B;

She turned up, sad and very emotional. She explained she ran off because she is terrified of losing our friendship, I said let's just cut the romance out, draw a line under it and be friends again but she seemed to not speak much when I said this. I asked if her ex was the issue - she said it was nothing to do with us but a whole other issue, but that was not impacting what was going on between us. We sat quietly, hugged and I tried to reassure it would be OK, and I wasn't going to start hating her for whatever reason, and I am completely fine with just being platonic friends again. We both agree and say whatever happens we stay friends and nobody gets hurt but we will pull back from the more physical side. This somehow ends up with us kissing? We kiss for a little while and I tell her she should probably go home and get some rest, but everything is ok. We get up and she helps make my bed, I give her a hug and open my bedroom door so she can leave, she then takes the door off me, closes it and kisses me - this then leads to sex and we have really passionate sex for about an hour. We get up, cuddle, kiss and she leaves.

&amp;#x200B;

I woke up this morning really panicky, I have no idea where we are, where we stand and absolutely terrified of losing our friendship. I don't know what to do or say. I've felt sick to my stomach and can't eat at the thought of this. She is coming around later to collect some of her clothes she left last night and I am thinking I need a plan of what to say/do.I cannot lose my best friend - she is absolutely everything to me but I am worried we crossed a line and there's only one eventual outcome which won't be good.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm super sorry if this is hard to read, but man it felt like a weight off my shoulders just typing this out. If there's a more appropriate sub for this I can post there instead

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR; slept with my absolute best friend of 2 years, both now having serious panic issues and overthinking with not knowing what to do. I don't know what I want and I think she is confused too - what on earth can we do to try and protect either of us from getting hurt???"
9,"I (26 F) know my roommate (21 F) contaminated my salicylic acid facial cleanser with Pine-Sol. She won’t fess up to it. We’re in the military and I don’t know if I should tell our higher ups.


**TL;DR** My roommate put what I believe is Pine-Sol in my facial cleanser. After unexplained animosity shown toward me, I believe she was either trying to prank me, ruin my stuff, or - at worst - chemically burn my face with this mixture. 

The title pretty much sums it up. I have two roommates, both of which I’m pretty good friends with. On Saturday, I took one of my roommates out with me all day (we’ll call her “S”) while the other one (we’ll call her “K”) stayed behind by herself all day. 

So here’s some background for you all. K and I have been best friends since basic training, so I don’t know where her sudden animosity toward me came from. Ever since we became roommates at AIT (Advanced Individual Training), she’s been acting differently. I will say that she *is* nice to my face, but she does some shady shit behind my back. For example, when I leave the room, she talks mad shit about me to our roommate, saying I don’t belong in the military and that I’m a “little bitch” for being medically discharged (I sustained fractures to both legs and a break to my already-once-broken foot during training lol).  When I’m not around, she calls her mom and obsessively talks about how she can’t stand me, how I’m annoying when I talk to my boyfriend, how she hates how I wear my makeup, etc. (All of this is coming from S, who made me swear not to say anything about it to K). S keeps to herself and will often pretend to have music playing through her headphones just to eavesdrop on K’s conversations (because K talks a lot of shit about S too). 

S also told me that, while I was away on leave last weekend for my sister’s wedding, she caught K rummaging through my drawers and belongings. She didn’t say anything to K about it, but she definitely told me about it right away. 

Fast forward to Saturday. I use this Clean ‘n’ Clear salicylic acid cleanser on my face every single day to avoid breakouts. We’re training in hot ass Texas, so we’re always sweating. Anyways, Saturday morning, before going out with S, I used the facial astringent and put my makeup on. K was in our room *all day long, all by herself.* Once S and I got back, I went to the bathroom sink and *immediately* noticed a drastic change in color to my facial astringent. It’s normally a grapefruit pink color, but it was now dark and murky purple. *The only purple thing we have is Pine-Sol.* I smelled the bottle, and it smelled like the salicylic acid mixed with flowery cleaner - the same scent as our Pine-Sol. I asked both roommates if they were pranking me, as I had *literally just* used the astringent before we left for the day. S reminded me that she was with me the whole day. K denied touching my facial cleaner. I asked K again, knowing she was full of shit. She, of course, continued to deny it. 

S insists that there’s no way K would go so far as to attempt to chemically burn my fucking face off by mixing my cleanser with Pine-Sol. I’m surprised she was dumb enough to think I wouldn’t notice the color change. Or maybe she was stupid and didn’t think there’d *be* a color change. Regardless, I can’t figure out what her motive would be, and quite frankly, I don’t care. I  gave her three opportunities to come clean and tell me she put something in my face sauce. Given that I only had a little bit of salicylic acid left in that particular bottle, I made it very clear that I wouldn’t be upset if she was just pranking me or something, because I had to go out and buy some more anyway. But no. She fiercely denies touching my facial cleanser, and insists that “*something*” must have mysteriously gotten into it.

Now I’m conflicted as to whether or not I should report this to cadre (i.e. our drill sergeants). I *know* she put *something* in my facial cleanser, and I don’t have a single doubt in my mind that it was her. But if it was some innocent prank and she’s just embarrassed to come forward, I don’t know if I should get her in trouble. I sound crazy right now, I know. 

Be as ruthless as you need to be in guiding me with this situation please!"
10,"Mom [50F] seemingly hates my [19F] younger sister [11F]. How can I help?


**TLDR: Sister is a difficult child, mom makes it worse. I'm worried for how my sister will grow up if this behaviour from both of them continues. What should I do?**

Sister [11F] was born at an inopportune time for my parents. We were short on money, our electricity/heating would go out every couple months, and my parent's business was failing. My mom's pregnancy was also very complicated, because unfortunately, sister [11F] has a heart condition (which added some expense to her birth). We got evicted 3 years after sister [11F] was born, and 2 years after sister [11F] was born, we both got a new younger sister [0F].

Sister [11F] has always been a ""problem child"". She struggles to make/keep friends in school. She is angry because she is constantly yelled at, which makes her yell more, parents punish her instead of trying to understand her, etc. She is bullied; kids steal her lunch and the teacher doesn't do much about it. Kids post mean things about her online. She struggles academically sometimes as well, but mostly socially. 

Other sister [9F] is completely the opposite. Fairly quiet kid, she'll do what you ask usually without question, easy time making friends. So my parents constantly compare [9F] to [11F] and you can tell who is the favourite. I'm sure if I can tell, [11F] can as well. 

The reason for writing this post is that my boyfriend and I decided to take my two sisters to an amusement park last Monday. This has been planned for a while, my parents both knew about it. I told my sisters Sunday night what the plans were for Monday (it was a surprise for them) and apparently my sister [11F] broke out in tears (**I no longer live with my parents or siblings, which is why I say ""apparently""**). My mother could not figure out why she was crying, so my mom just screamed at her that ""fine, you arent going tomorrow and that's it"". Which of course, makes her cry more.

I eventually figured out that [11F] was upset that her younger sister [9F] had already been to this amusement park twice with her friends, and [11F] was upset because she had never gone before, because she doesn't have friends to take her. I told her I understood her frustration. She apologized to my mom for not communicating. My mom accepted the apology, but then said to me over the phone that ""it was good she apologized, but shes still not going, because she was in a bad mood anyway so she doesn't deserve to go."" (We ended up going after much much convincing. I also already had the tickets which are 40 dollars each, so I didn't want to waste my money as well).

These types of situations happen quite often. My family is very toxic. As another example, when we went to the amusement park my mom packed us all a lunch. She forgot [11F]'s lunch but nobody elses, so I gave my mom a call and said ""Hey, did you pack [11F]'s lunch?"" 
My mom said ""No, I forgot, sorry.""
I said ""Oh. Well, we'll figure something out for her then.""
My mom said ""Is she upset [that she didn't get her lunch]?""
I said ""well, sort of. She is hungry and she was looking forward to it""
Mom says ""Oh well, she can starve for all I care.""

Like who says that?

I am so worried for how [11F] will grow up in this toxic household. Sometimes I regret moving out because I feel like maybe I could have protected them better. I don't know what I can do to help."
11,"I [F27] think my SO’s mother [F50s] has a life-threatening illness but is it my business?


The title sounds dramatic but it’s honestly what I’m suspecting. I’ve been with my SO [M27] for 10y but getting married isn’t our priority right now. His parents are super chilled (as are mine) and just last year we had a loose discussion about marriage in general and his mom said we were too young and should enjoy our lives and save up for a house and vacations etc. His mom has always advised against marriage and always used to go on about how young we are and how much is ahead of us etc. 

Lately, his mom has been having several private specialist appointments with doctors and his parents are spending their savings. We know this because his brother [18M] told us and he is worried. 

I was with my SO at his parents’ house last month. Literally out of the blue, she said “you know you guys should get married, I would love to see that”. She sounded serious and a little downtrodden tbh so I thought my SO had told her something that made her doubt our relationship but he denied this. I made a joke about us being young but she was super serious. She looked depressed. 

Last week, I went to lunch with her and she said something about us being good parents “one day” and “I can’t be around for all of it but I wish I could be”. I wanted to ask her what she meant but in the moment I thought I was overthinking things. 

I have discussed this extensively with my SO. He worries about his loved ones very intensely. He also pushes his worries to the back of his mind until he can’t ignore them. I don’t tell him when I’m a little bit sick because he worries and he often finds out about his mom or dad’s illnesses (3 incidences) way after they’ve happened. He thinks I’m overthinking things but usually I have a pretty good gut feeling. I know he’s thinking the same, as is his brother, but he’s trying to sweep it under the carpet. 

I basically want other people’s opinions about whether it is my place to approach his mother about this or if we can all sit down together and talk. I am so sure about this that I don’t even think I’m wrong and that I’ll make a fool out of myself. But I’m not even a fiancée, just a long-term girlfriend so I wonder if I’m overstepping. 

TL;DR I think my future MIL is seriously unwell but hiding it"
12,"My (25M) Mother (56F) has become obsessed with a YouTuber and I don't know how to approach this.


My Mother started watching a YouTuber that is based in our city in March of this year. She found a few of his videos and enjoyed them a lot, so she became a fan and started watching all of his content. No big deal, she's allowed to do whatever she wants. She's a grown adult and how she spends her time is her business.

He posts a new video at 8 am, every single day. He has a podcast in video and audio form, and he does live streams to talk to his fans. In 3 months, she has watched every video, listened to and watched every podcast, and been there for every stream. This was a bit odd, but still, not a cause for any major concern.

It became a problem when she found out that he worked out of an office that she recognized (from a video that he posted) and planned to go there to meet him and give him a gift. I let her know that that was NOT okay, and that she should respect his privacy as he is still a person, and she thinks that it's fine. She's met him before and he is always happy to meet fans should they happen to meet in public, but she doesn't seem to understand the difference between meeting him in a grocery store and going to an office that he has not released the address of publicly.

How do I approach this? How do I convince her that doxxing people from the content they post is NEVER okay and that she needs to respect his privacy? I don't want her to think she's not allowed to enjoy things but I really need her to understand that this is NOT okay.

TL;DR Mom is obsessed with a Youtuber, doxxed him and made plans to visit his office. How do I convince her that this is NOT okay without stifling her interest?"
13,"UPDATE: I [22 M] cannot seem to move past my father's [47 M] treatment of me when I was a child even though I really want to. Any suggestions for how to approach this?


I originally posted around September last year for advice ([here's](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/9fvtwf/i_22_m_cannot_seem_to_move_past_my_fathers_47_m/) the original post), and I finally have an update if any of the people who posted advice to me are interested.

So last year after the post I (now 23 M) decided I didn't want to talk to my father (47 M). I was initially supposed to see him the following month, but opted not to. After asking a friend for some advice I decided not to talk to my father anymore. So for about a week I didn't, and it seemed to go fairly well. Then he rang one day (landline doesn't have caller ID) and completely threw me off. I was short with him, which he noticed and asked me if I was okay. I lied and said I was tired which he appeared to accept, although rather reluctantly. 

About ten minutes after I hung up, he called my mother (48 F) on her phone. He asked if there was anything wrong with me, and she explained (with my permission) that I was upset because of how he treated me during my childhood. He understood, and was apologetic for it. She also told him that I didn't want to speak to him, and that I would contact him when I was comfortable to. 

A few weeks later after no contact he rang me to apologise, and I ended up reestablishing contact with him. This continued for several months, and seemed to be going pretty well. Then he started having issues at home, and started being more distant - he'd make excuses to not have a long phone call, we'd go a few weeks to a month without any contact, that sort of thing. I realise this probably doesn't sound like much, but it was depressing not to talk to him for long periods of time.

Anyway, something happened which made me think ""he's never going to change"". He was apparently treating his girlfriend poorly, acting sullen around her and making her feel bad. This was how he used to treat me as a child, and I decided I was done. I didn't want someone like this in my life, and so I made the decision to go no-contact. I sent him an email explaining how he made me feel as a child, gave examples of things he'd done and told him I didn't want to talk to him again. It was not an easy thing to do, and part of me still wonders if I did the wrong thing. What doesn't help was his response - he was completely understanding and apologetic, and said he was still there for me if I changed my mind. I know this sounds odd, but if he'd sent me some sort of scathing reply it would have been a lot easier for me.

Anyway, there's the update. Sorry for how long it is.

TLDR: Went no-contact with my dad, he got back in touch, talked for several months until I decided to go no-contact again."
14,"My[18F] brother-in-law[38M] kissed me, and tried to sleep with me. I am so confused on what to do because my future is on the line.


My sister Teresa[33F] has been married to Rick[38M] for 15 years, but they have been together for around 18. That being said, I have known Rick for my entire life. He has always been like a real brother to me. So much so, when my parents moved back to California after I turned 12, Teresa and Rick let me live with them, and have taken care of me since then.

From the outside looking in, Rick and my sister seemed to have a perfect relationship too, they hardly argued, and my sister has not had to work one day in her life. Rick always just bought her everything she asked for, he always did the same for me too.

I recently learned that I got into NYU, but I had no idea how I would afford it. My parents aren't rich, and I thought I would have to work 2 jobs and go to school full time, plus go into debt for the rest of my life. Again, Rick comes to my rescue, and promises he will take care of everything for me.

Fast forward to last night, I went to a party at a friends. It was a beginning of summer pool party. I dont usually drink,  but for some reason I did. I got extremely drunk. My best friend called my sister to pick me up at the end of the night, and Teresa sent Rick instead. During the ride home, for some reason, I got a bit emotional. I started telling him that he was such a great man, and that I hope I find someone like him one day,  and that my sister was so lucky etc. 

He started talking about how proud he was of me. And how I grew up into such a smart, beautiful woman. I didn't notice that he had pulled over by this point. He touched my face and called me beautiful again. I was so dumb, I have been in that situation with boys before, I should have known where it was headed, but I didn't. 

He reached over and pulled me in for a kiss. I should have stopped him, or smacked him or something. But I didn't. I just kind of froze and let him kiss me. He started to grope me under my bikini top. I still didn't say anything. He was touching me all over and kissing my neck. I finally whimpered out to him to stop when he started to put his hand into my bottoms.

He didn't stop right away, I dont k ow if he heard me. I said it a little louder twice more. And he stopped. He asked what was wrong, and was I okay. I started to cry. I cried like i have never cried before. I said why did you do that, my sister is going to hate me. You ruined everything. 

He just sat and stared at me for a little while. After a few minutes, he asked me if I were calm. He said that my sister would be fine. She wouldn't hate me. This whole thing was just a mistake, a misunderstanding. He apologized. He said I should just forget all about it. I said I dont know if I could. He said he knows I can, and will. He said that this was my last summer at home after all. In the fall I would go to NYU,  and also, he was going to surprise me later, but he and my sister had decided to buy me a brand new car to use at school. He said that he really was proud of all of my hard work, and he would hate for it all to be for nothing just because of an embarrassing misunderstanding. 

We drove the rest of the way home in silence.  This morning he took the whole family, including me to denny's.  It was like none of that even happened. He went to work a bit later. 

I dont know what to do. I dont know if I should tell my sister, or if I should just keep it to myself. Telling would affect so many people. I dont know if in my drunkenness i sent him signals. If i tell, i will ruin things for my sister, for my nephew[8M], for Rick,  and for me.

What should I do?

**TL;DR** After knowing him my entire life, my sisters husband kissed me and tried to sleep with me. I stopped him, and  he said it was just a misunderstanding and I should forget about it. I dont know if I can."
15,"I (29F) am considering uninviting my fiance's (30M) best friend (31M) from our wedding


Backstory: I met Matt 5 years ago and we started dating shortly after. He was best friend with one of his coworkers, Alex, who was dating Kate at the time.  We all got along very well and became a close knit group. When Matt and I moved in together, we lived very close to Kate and Alex and we hang out all the time. We were all there for each other, planned holidays together and laughed about how our future kids will probably have to marry each other. 

Kate and Alex got engaged last year and we were thrilled for them. Then they bought a house together and then Matt and I got engaged and were looking for a house in the same neighbourhood. Life seemed pretty cool. 

Then everything basically went to shit. A new woman joined Alex and Matt's office, let's name her Tina. All of a sudden, I kept hearing about her. After work drinks? Tina was there. Gym during lunch hour? Tina was there. Office darts team? You guessed it, Tina. The thing is, all these groups used to be guys only before. Then Matt started mentioning how well and and Tina were getting along and I just knew something wasn't right. 

Long story short, he ended up confessing to Kate that he had cheated with Tina. Obviously, everybody was heartbroken. Kate moved out and stayed with us for a while. Matt and I were in the middle, listening to both their sides and trying to make sense of everything. A lot more issues in their relationship came to light. For months it kept dragging on and they kept going back and forth in whether they should break up or not.

Finally, everything finalised when Alex announced he was now dating Tina. Kate moved back home with her parents, in a different city. Things seem to have settled down somewhat.

Now Matt and I are planning our wedding. I want Kate there, she has been a great friend to me. Obviously Matt wants Alex there, they've been friends since school. And of course I want Alex there,  we are very close. The only problem is Alex asked if he could bring Tina. I said no and explained that Kate is one of my best friends and what happened between them is still so fresh. I don't want her uncomfortable and hurt on my wedding day. Also, selfish or not, I don't want this drama on my special day.

I have made it clear to Alex from the beginning that I think what he did was awful and I blame Tina for her part in this as well, as she knew he was engaged and still she pursued him. However, I told him I am not in the position to interfere in his life and choices so if he wants to date Tina and she makes him happy, then I'm happy for him. But I draw the line at my wedding.

Alex says he understands but that Tina already feels like a pariah in our extended group of friends because everyone loved Kate so much. He says he has to think whether he is comfortable coming to the wedding without her. Now Matt is hurt because he might not have his best friend there.

All in all it's a shitty situation. What would you guys do?

TL;DR: my fiance's best friend cheated on his SO and wants to bring his new girlfriend to our wedding. The problem is his ex is one of my closest friends and also attending the wedding."
16,"My [26 F] roommate(s) of 5 months [27 M, 27F] has/have messy diarrhea every day and want to take turns cleaning rather than hiring someone, looking for help approaching this tactfully


Hey! So I (F26) have been living with a couple (M/F 27) for the last 5 months. They are super nice people, but at least one of them has diarrhea every single day. There is always a speckling of poo around the toilet bowl and the bathroom usually doesn’t smell very fresh.

When I first moved in I suggested we hire someone to clean the apartment once/month, which would come out to $25 per person. They came back saying that it was too expensive for them and that they wanted to just all take turns cleaning. That would be fine, but it really bothers me to clean up someone else’s literal chunks of poo. They also have a lovely dog who sheds a lot, so when it’s my turn I also have to spend a lot of time taking care of the fur- again feels like someone else’s mess rather than a shared mess.

I want to bring up hiring someone again, but I need to be prepared to hear “no”. I haven’t specifically brought up the diarrhea because it’d be quite awkward, but at this point I feel like I might have to. Any advice for dealing with this tactfully?

TLDR: How do I talk to my roommates about hiring someone to clean, because I really can't stomach cleaning their poop up anymore"
17,"My [M 25] Future Father in Law [M 50+] is angry that I didn't invite him to my Bachelor Party


We've know each other for 4 years now.

I just got back from a 3 day long bachelor party in Las Vegas and I'm trying to figure out why my future father in law is so angry about the situation. 

I'm going to call Future Father in Law FFIL throughout the post.

The party was planned with a couple friends from High school and college. We planned around going to Las Vegas, gambling, drinking, clubbing, the whole 9 yards.

I posted a daily update at the end of each day on social media to celebrate how awesome my friends are and how memorable the trip has been. The first day FFIL posts a passive aggressive comment on my post of ""why are you in Vegas?"" And ""thanks for the invite 😕😕😕"". I ignore him.

Day 2 comes and I do it again and he posts ""😠😠😠"" all over my posts. I just ignore him.

Day 3 comes and I'm playing blackjack in a casino when I receive this exact message ""you might not have been the one who organized the bachelor party, but I should have been invited. I probably would have not been able to attend, but I should have been given the opportunity to go."" 

Mind you I had been drinking, I was in a casino and I didn't want to deal with it, but I didn't want to ignore him either so I responded ""I'd be happy to talk about it when I get home if you want. Let me know.""

FFIL also responded with ""Not scoring a lot of points with me lately. I feel a bit disrespected twice now. You don't have the decency to even talk to me about your intent to marry my daughter. I approve, but you should have at least let me know you were going to propose to her.""

That last point was had a long conversation we had months ago and I had thought we came to a mutual understanding that I just am not traditional like that. Desperate the that he felt the need to bring it up again.

Day 3 of the party is over in which I reported I actually made over $400 in the casino, and FFIL passive aggressive comments continue.

Now that I'm home my open invitation to talk to me is still open to him but he hasn't taken my up on it. He's been silent since I've offered to resolve this face to face.

Not really sure what to do at this point. Do I wait for him to talk to me, or do I reach out to him? What should I say/do?

TLDR: FFIL is mad I didn't invite him to my Bachelor party and during the trip he blew up my social media and private messages me multiple times to express his disappointment."
18,"I (31F) don’t want to give an ultimatum on engagement but can’t keep waiting for bf (31M)


My boyfriend and I have been together for nearly 4 years. I can honestly say he’s my best friend and I can always trust that he has my best interest at heart. We’re very different in that I am type A (goal-driven and vigilantly responsible but also high anxiety and risk averse), while my bf is more of a free spirit (spontaneous and joyful but also struggles with structure and goals). 

We have been through a lot together and have worked very hard to build our relationship to where it is today. My bf struggled with depression, job loss, deaths in his family, and some significant credit card debt. I’ve struggled with a few major bouts of anxiety, separating my relationship with my emotionally abusive mother, and a significant health scare. Through all this we’ve learned to work together as a team and have both become better people.

The struggle I’m having is that I feel like we’ve reached a point where we should get engaged. I’m 31 and the women in my family have all had issues conceiving children / having healthy pregnancies and children after their mid-30s. I adamantly don’t want to have children after 36/37. I would love to have children, but only if I’m married with the right partner before that age. The other, smaller issue, is my family is conservative and very unhappy that after nearly a year of living together my bf has not proposed. My family is starting to feel like my boyfriend is using me because I make a lot more and pay for most things, but he won’t do the responsible thing and get engaged. Other than this issue my family has welcomed my boyfriend and supported us. I worry that by dragging things out my family’s opinion of my bf will continue to change for the worse.

My bf is adamant that he wants to get married someday and wants to have multiple children. I’ve shared with him my concerns. Specifically, that if we wait too long I will not want / be able to have children - which I know is a dealbreaker for him. My boyfriend says he feels like life is good and we’re happy so there’s no rush for engagement. He says he wants to get married someday, but the timing hasn’t felt right and he wants to wait until he can ‘feel it’. 

I’ve sometimes struggled to ask for what I want because I often feel I don’t deserve them. It is behavior I’m trying to change. I want to give my bf a timeline that we get engaged by my 32nd birthday (timing wise it makes sense if we want kids) or break up. I feel like after 4 years of dating and a year living together if we’re not sure of getting married we will never be sure.

On the other hand I don’t want him to propose just because I’ve given him an ultimatum. if he proposes after an ultimatum I will always worry that it was because I forced him to. I want him to want to do it. I feel like I’m going around in circles and just need to figure it out. I would appreciate any advice on how to handle this?


TLDR: After 4 yrs dating, I (31F) want to get engaged and have kids before 37 due to health concerns. My bf (31M) doesn’t feel the timing is right but is also adamant about eventually getting married and having 2-3 kids. I think this puts a timeline on engagement, but don’t want to have to make an ultimatum. Not sure what to do."
19,"Need advise. My father in-law Took me aside and told me to never ever degrade and disrespect his daughter again.


Last Sunday I was having breakfast with my wife and parents in-law. Out of the blue my father wanted to talk to me outside. He wanted to look at all the yard work I did for them Saturday. He started off with a compliment and he said that he appreciated the hard work.. All of a sudden he got very angry and told me to never ever degrade his daughter and disrespect his wife in front of him..He told me to never tell my wife to shut up. (I never have).

&amp;#x200B;

It took me a moment to realize what he was saying. I asked him specifically what I said that offended him so much. He couldn't say or remember. (we were just having breakfast a few min ago) I told him that I would never disrespect my wife and that I had no idea what he was talking about.

At this point I got angry also and made several comments that I was offended. I looked him straight in the eyes and he backed down and looked confused.

I realized again that nothing actually happened.. My wife and I did not have any argument what so ever and there was simply nothing that could have been interpreted as disrespectful towards my wife and mother in-law.

I calmed down again, lowered my voice and asked him again what happened? Asked him what it was that made him mad. He didn't know, apologized and said he may have misunderstood or misinterpreted the situation.

We both started walking back inside. I still felt that it wasn't resolved so I told him again that I love them both and that I would never mistreat his daughter (my wife). I gave him a hug and asked him if we could keep this between us.  
He agreed.

&amp;#x200B;

It's important to note that his heart is in a poor condition. His brain is not getting the normal amount of oxygen.  
My wife told me later that day that he got a 1000 dollars from their bank account and lost it. Even worse he got angry with his wife because he told her he never went to the bank in the first place. (They went together)

He is obviously struggling with remembering things. He is very argumentative when his wife tells him he is wrong.  
He was convinced he visited China in the past and his wife had to tell him several times that they never visited China.  
Many more examples I hope you get the picture.

My question is this. Was I wrong asking him to keep it between us? I was trying to not upset my wife about his memory loss even more. (she is having a very difficult time at work and we just lost our oldest pet Friday).

Should I tell my wife what happened anyway?  
Should I tell my mother in-law what happened?  
Thank you, I am struggling to figure out what to do with this.

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR: My father in law was very angry with me. No apparent reason. I suspect a mental/medical issue. Should I tell my wife what happened?"
20,"My [28F] grandparents [87F/94M] thought I stole money from them when I didn't. My grandmother most likely has Alzheimer's and convinced the family I did. It's now been proven that I didn't. How should I move forward?


What the title says... My grandfather called me earlier and left a voicemail asking for me to call back, I assume to apologize. My dad threatened to kick me out and made me get a drug test and checked my arm for heroin marks because they had convinced him I stole money and was possibly on drugs. Well, I didn't steal the money. I passed by the drug test. The money was found later by my dad and I. My psychologist says this sounds like it could be early Alzheimer's with my grandmother. She misplaced money and was so convinced I stole it she cried and told everyone I did. I had gone over to help them with their computer. She asks the same questions in the same conversation and my grandfather drives her places now because she gets lost on her own. My dad is now mad at my family because they seem to not want to get her a diagnosis and think this was all a misunderstanding.

My grandfather even asked my dad if it was possible I planted the money after taking it.

My grandfather just called I'm guessing to apologize but I'm still mad about getting accused, so I haven't called him back yet. With my dad emotionally worked up about it still, I'm feeling kind of overwhelmed on how to handle this situation with my family.

Tldr; Grandmother who probably has Alzheimer's convinced the family I stole money when I didn't. The money was found. Now it's awkward. Not sure how to proceed."
21,"I (19f) recently discovered that I have a brother (44m) and I don't know how to talk to him about my[our] apparently abusive mother(63f)


The title might not be click-worthy but I am completely lost and as you can see my two lasts post are also about him in other subs, I'm afraid to lose him. There's a lot to unpack please stay with me.

TL;DR My mother acts pretty badly with me but my brother knows her as an extremely nice person, I really need support and to talk about this to someone I'm close to but I don't want him to think that I'm lying about her/using him for money as I really appreciate him.

Some ***context***: my Mother had my Brother around 18, then his father died and she left my brother with his grandparents. She took him back in her life multiples times but only a few years as she went to another country to have a stable life. Then later on (44) she had me. My father happened to be a pedophile and my mother left with me to another city and I live with her only since I'm 4. I wasn't aware of his existence (or very vaguely) until this year. First time I met him was a quick dinner where I also met his daughter(9) second time was 3 weeks ago where I spent a day with him, my mother and his daughter.

I've always been very very close to my mother until I turned 16 I think? That's when she noticed that I loved drawing and decided to shut down this passion by every means, she would tear up my stuff, screams when she saw a doodle in my HS textbook and blames everything on my art ""If you have bad marks it's because you draw."" ""Keep on drawing and you will fail in life."" It's also the moment where I started to spiral into depression. She strongly believes that depression doesn't exist: ""It's a thing that white people made up to have an excuse when they are just really lazy."" So no support for me from her.

It spiraled so badly that one day when I was basically begging for support I came to her saying that I wanted to kill myself and she simply said: ""Then go ahead what do you want me to say?"" I felt very betrayed. It never ameliorated. The week before my hs finals she threw me out at 3 AM because I told her that saying that Asian people are all dogs wasn't really correct. And this happens a lot so I learned to shut up when she says this kind of things (I mean I'm trying, she still threw me out recently because I pointed out that we had Arabs in our football team and she told me to get fucked by Syrians???) She is like this a lot. I shut up when we get into arguments but she always compares me to my father, ""You're just like your father."" ""A monster that's what you are don't you have any respect for me? Just like he had for you when you were a child."" And this over literally anything. I can't say anything bad to her because ""I saved you from him all by myself you should be grateful."" ""How dare you talk like this to the person who sacrificed everything for you?"". She also guilts me a lot into telling her that she a good mother, sometimes after her screaming monologues she would cry saying that she's a bad mother and she worked hard for nothing and such and I feel bad enough to say the opposite.

A moment to remember is when she said while crying that I was the only one that ever helped her because one day I surprised her by inviting her to a restaurant while my grown brother only called her in 30 years to ask for money. Later you'll see that it was a big big lie.

So 3 weeks ago ***I met my brother*** with the rest of our 4 persons little family, he's amazing, has a lot of life experience and made his own fortune all by himself when no one believed in him! He took back some businesses that didn't work, made them work so good that everyone asked him to make their work again and he owns a restoration chain in the US that he wants to expand in the UK in the next few years. When he talked to me about his life stories, every time he says that he worked on something that didn't work my mother muttered that it was a bad idea and that he could've lost it all/shouldn't have done that. If he had listened to her, he wouldn't be here now.

Then at the restaurant, I joked saying that he could pay something for our mother for once and he responded by ""every time you come to the Caribbeans I'm paying everything for you both but I can pay the bill now if mom wants me to."" Oh. Ok. We're going here a lot so he's far from not helping financially as she said to me.

At one point we were talking about our mother, he said that she reads a lot and loved books, I told him that in 19 years of life I never ever saw her reading a book and that she constantly watches TV, this is a very important bit as she said to him ***""See how she badmouth your mother, making me look like I'm not an intellectual? Just like your father's mother badmouthed everyone.""***

First I noticed that we were far from knowing the same person and that he will now think that I talk shit about her.

It went great with my brother tho, he loves comics as well! And videogames, history, and philosophy! I was so happy to talk to someone who, when disagreeing with me, simply explained his point of view and had greats and diverse arguments instead of screaming at me. We talked a lot while walking however every two minutes or so, my mother would turn around and say ""We aren't here to hear you talking."" ""Do you even breath sometimes?"" ""You annoy me please stop talking."" ""It's been a few times that you said this name, I don't care."" And she snapped when we arrived close to a monument ""Anon shut the fuck up now we're in a family meeting not in a we-have-to-listen-to-your-lunatic-speech meeting."" And I shut up. It made me terribly sad as we had a lot of fun with my brother, you know when two best friends scream together ""YESSSSS"" when they notice that they like the same thing? We did this a lot. He's great.

~~I'm putting here some more things that happened but if you don't care I'll just state my issue below this copied paragraph from a discord discussion: ""his little girl is 9, we walked in Paris for 6 hours so she was getting tired you know. And I don't know why my mother adores guilting people but apparently, any ages are fine for her. She took my niece and told her ""I told my son to come today in the morning instead of tomorrow just for you not to be tired. Are you tired? If so I asked your father to move our meeting for nothing and next time we won't be bringing you. Do you get this? So are you tried now? Tell your grandma if you're tired."" See how she guilt her if she's tired and forces her to say that she's not, no matters what ? She is fucking n I n e. Then I told her calmly that she has the right to be tired maybe she should not force her to say the opposite. She screamed at me so hard that the nine years old cried in my brother's arms ????? Then my mother turned at me and said right in my face ""See? This is your fault, you're being too controlling, you should stop talking."" And she hugged my niece saying ""It's fine I'm not screaming at you, at least you're having a good time with your grandma right ?""
I can't believe that.
My brother was surprised and told me that he didn't know that she was like that when she said: ""Oh yeah that's since Anon is born, she took my last bit of kindness away from me.""~~

So yeah. Before leaving he made me install Whatsapp so we could talk together, I'm very glad that I have a nice family member to talk to however, I don't know how to talk to him about what's happening, why do I want to leave the house and if he could help me with art school. I'm seriously afraid that he will think that I'm lying about our mother to make her look bad and that I'm using him only for money. Please any help would be appreciated. Thanks !"
22,"Apparently everyone knows that my (41F) husband (45M) is cheating, but me


I am still at work typing this and I just found out by accident. We have 3 kids together and what I thought was a great life. I get that cheating is not all that uncommon but ya know, you always think it can’t/won’t happen to you. Well it did and I feel like I was punched in the gut with full force. This post contains some TMI/NSFW. 

My husband and I met in high school, dated all the way through college and married after graduation. We have 3 wonderful children, the oldest is 18, youngest is 13. Please pardon if this is TMI. Our sex life has been alright, we are certainly not having as much sex as we did in our younger years, which I thought was normal for 2 busy adults with full time jobs and kids. We engage in sexual activities probably 3 times per month. Lately, I have been the one initiating, while in the past he would always do this. Did not think much of it since he has a big project going on at work and I pinned it on the crazy schedule and stress. He also had some erection problems in the past 2-3 months, which in the light of this news, might be because he isn’t attracted to me anymore. 

Today I met with a neighbor who is getting divorced herself. We exchanged the usual pleasantries, then she asked if she could give me some advice even though it is not her place to get involved. I said sure. Turns out my husband has been having his mistress over AT OUR HOUSE when I work nights. WITH OUR KIDS ASLEEP. She went on saying that this vehicle kept coming into our driveway every time I was working night shift. The car would come in the evening and leave at 6-7am, which is right before our kids wake up for school. Neighbor said that other neighbors also noticed and saw my husband kissing this lady out front. I’m gutted and I excused myself, she probably felt bad for breaking the news to me like that. 

My husband was at work so I went to his laptop (probably shouldn’t have) and did some digging. What I found was even worse. They have videos and pictures of them doing...things that I cannot even describe. I’m so embarrassed. Pardon my French - I saw my husband getting fucked by this lady with a dildo. Him sucking on that object. In addition to all the other debauchery. He never, even when we were younger, expressed any interest in...flipping the table so to speak. When we do have sex, it’s generally vanilla. We tried to spice things up a while ago but we never went anywhere near this sort of kinky. 

I had to go to work so I put his laptop away and dragged myself to work. I can’t focus on anything. Now I question everything, our whole 25+ relationship. Why would he do this to me and to our family? I’m especially bothered that he invited this lady into our home and bed, with our children in the same house. From the pictures, she seems really young, maybe 25 years old and definitely better looking than me. I don’t know for how long this has been going on, the neighbor only told me she noticed the suspect car 3 months ago. I’m disgusted by what I saw in those pictures, that is not the man I married. I dread going back home after work and I don’t know how to start the conversation or what to say. Some guidance?

TL;DR: my husband has been bringing his mistress into our home and our neighbors knew about it"
23,"I (29F) may be going on vacation with my dad (77M) overseas for a week this summer, and my boyfriend (33M) of 8 years, thinks it is weird


I have been with my boyfriend for 8 years now. We have lived together for the past 6 years. I moved to the other end of the country to live with him. We have since moved to a half way point between his family and my family. 9ish hours to either family. My dad wants to go across seas this summer for a week and wants to treat me to my ticket. He is getting older and I only see him a few times a year. So I was pretty excited when he mentioned he wanted to go on an adventure with me. He didnt mention anything about inviting my boyfriend and he probably didnt realize it may hurt my boyfriends feeling, being excluded from the plan.  I understand him wanting to spend quality time with me as we are very close. And, since I live and work with my boyfriend, I dont think it's a huge deal if i take a vacation without, and just go with my dad. My boyfriend thinks it is weird to go on vacation with just your parent and that he is excluded. Am I in the wrong for not finding it necessary that he comes along ? Thanks in advance!

TL; DR: my dad wants to go on vacation with just me for a week, and my boyfriend thinks it's ""weird"" that he wasn't invited and thinks it is weird to vacation with just a parent."
24,"One of my [30F] coworkers [30sM] that I supervise asked me out and got turned down and now everything is awkward.


One of my [30F] coworkers [30sM] that I supervise asked me out and got turned down and now everything is awkward.

So at my job we work in teams of three. There's one supervising person and two who work under them. I currently supervise two guys. We have to work together, sometimes one on one for days at a time. The company has several of these teams.

A couple days ago, one of the guys I supervise started using every available chance he got to touch me. Anytime he was within reach he'd reach over and pat me on the back. Now, this would be annoying under normal circumstances but I have haphephobia (fear of being touched), and I'm especially afraid of being touched by men. Needless to say, I wasn't feeling great about it. He did it around five times in two hours while I was just trying to work. I was pretty much trapped in the work room until the end of the day so I couldn't just walk away, and I tried to avoid giving him the opportunity to keep reaching over and touching me, but I'm partially deaf so he just kept sneaking up on me.

At the end of the day I sort of wrote it off as weird behavior that maybe I was making too much out of because of my phobia, but he did it again the next morning. Then as we were leaving for lunch he blocked the exit of the room I was in and confessed that he had a huge crush on me and asked me out. I told him I wasn't interested. I'm also gay, but didn't mention it at the time because I was too weirded out. Unfortunately since he picked the middle of the day for this, I had to go back to work with him for the next four hours. It was extremely awkward.

The next day I wound up having to tell my own supervisor what had happened because I started having a mild anxiety attack at the thought of having to work so closely with him after that. My supervisor spoke to HR and they both think I need to have a one on one conversation with the guy to ""clear the air"" and then keep working with the guy on my three person team. The thought of talking to him about it again is really stressing me out and I don't really want to have to work one on one with this guy every day now. What should I say/do?

TL;DR One of the guys I supervise started touching me all the time, then confessed his love and asked me out while I was trying to work. I shot him down, but now I'm really uncomfortable around him and my boss wants me to talk to the guy and make it less awkward."
25,"My [28F] younger coworker [21F] is in a relationship with a ton of red flags and I'm concerned for her, but I'm not sure what, if anything, I should say to her.


I've been working with her for a few years and I am somewhat of a mentor/supervisor to her. Lately we've been working more closely which leads to more conversations, including learning more about her relationship. In a few conversations with her about her boyfriend, she complained about the following:

1) He came home late and didn't fully close the back door which caused the cat to get out. She woke up early in the morning and realized that the cat got out and her boyfriend wouldn't get up to help her retrieve the cat. She said this has happened several times.

2) She didn't sleep well last night because she had to sleep on the living room floor, because her boyfriend snores.

3) He complained to her that she had a tendency to talk over people and was obnoxious in social groups, then used a description of her astrological sign to support his description of her. When she said he'd hurt her feelings, he said that she was talking it too personally and blamed THAT on her astrological sign as well.

4) Several allusions to his heavy drinking.

After hearing more about their relationship, I had this nagging feeling that there was a weird power imbalance in their relationship so I asked how old he was...lo and behold, he's 41 years old. I'm worried for her because she has a history of self-harm and depression, and she doesn't have a good relationship with her parent. This relationship has ALL the red flags and I want to have a serious talk with her to try to get her to see this, but I'm afraid that if I say anything she will clam up and the only thing it will achieve is to stop her feeling comfortable confiding in me. She's supposedly planning on buying a house with this man in a couple of months, yet this afternoon she texted saying that he called in sick to work because he stayed out too late last night and now he's out drinking with a woman and avoiding her messages. How can I support her? Is it possible to help her see some sense, or is it best to just be a shoulder to cry on?

TL;DR:. My younger coworker is in a relationship that is teeming with red flags, including a 20 year age difference. Is it possible to help her see that this relationship is not healthy?"
26,"I (F26) feel terrible for cutting off all contact with my younger brother (M25) and letting him stay homeless.


 

My younger brother Pete (25) and I (26) do not have any other family around us. Growing up, Pete and I were really close and did anything to help each other out. Our mom passed away 3 years ago, and our father was never present. I guess that probably has a lot to do with Pete's ongoing mental issues. He has been clinically diagnosed with depression since he was a teen, however, he has not been on any meds for at least 5 years.He has voluntarily stopped going to any therapy visits because he thinks he is ""just fine."" Time and time again, I've tried to be supportive of him, only for him to say there is nothing wrong with him. I've been trying my best to understand his actions as of lately. I think I am just fed up and don't really know what to do at this point.

Pete is probably the laziest and most entitled person that I know. He refuses to work full time, yet he expects to be paid at least $1000 a week without having any sort of skill or degree other than a high school diploma. He is currently on the verge of getting fired because his work ethic and attitude are terrible. This isn't news to me, because we worked as servers at the same restaurant a few years ago (I actually helped him get that job). He often stood in the kitchen and got into altercations with other coworkers. He ended up getting fired because he was caught taking bites off customers' meals. A bunch of us servers heard him yelling at our manager, saying ""I work here so I get to have the food that I want!""

I've let Pete stay with my boyfriend and me a few times this past year. He has been sleeping on his friends' couches when he isn't staying with us, only for him to get kicked out by them too. Otherwise, he would sleep in his car. My boyfriend and I never really allowed him to stay for more than 2 weeks because he never seems to respect our space, belongings, or our time. Every time that we allowed him to stay, it would start off okay for the first few days. Eventually, he would let his ""true"" side come out. He would always leave dirty dishes and cups in random places in the house, refused to do his own laundry/buy his own groceries/make his own food, kept leaving lights on around the house, and blasted his music really loudly in the guest room. We would notice a sharp increase in our electricity usage every time that Pete stayed with us, it was just getting too out of hand. Anytime my boyfriend and I would intervene, Pete would say something to the effect of ""I'm a grown man and this is my place, I do what I want!"" My boyfriend and I agreed last month that Pete could stay in the guest room if he cleaned up after himself, stayed relatively quiet, and got a full time job. We would charge him a flat rate of $400/mo, which is less than half of what rent would cost if he stayed in a studio in town. Unsurprisingly, this conversation didn't go well with Pete because he expected to have free rent. Apparently, he deserves that amenity because I'm his sister. He ended up grabbing a remote control and hurling it at our TV. Needless to say, he is not welcome here anymore.

Most recently, he has been reported to the police by his now ex-girlfriend, Hannah (23). This is probably the most significant reason why I am not allowing Pete to stay with my boyfriend and I again. Pete and Hannah started dating earlier around April of this year. Now that I look back on it, I was foolish to think that Pete was getting better because of Hannah, even though he seemed to be happier while they were in a relationship. I've met Hannah a few times. She seems to be a well-intentioned girl, maybe a little too nice for her own good. A month into their relationship, Hannah and I had a one-on-one conversation when I noticed that Pete had yelled at her for not buying him something that he wanted. She was hesitant to tell me that this was a somewhat regular occurrence. She had also been picking up 100% of the tab whenever they went out on dates. Pete had lied to her about having a stable job and his own place to stay when he met her. Basically, I got the impression that Hannah felt obligated to help Pete in every way possible. I told her that she deserved better, and her helping Pete without him putting any effort will just enable him to keep treating her the way he does. I also had a one-on-one with Pete (definitely not for the first time), basically telling him to cut out his BS. Again, he insisted that he was doing nothing wrong.

Hannah is a recent college grad and has been staying at an older female's house to help keep living expenses down. She told me that one rule that she and her roommate established upon moving in was that Hannah could not have any overnight male company. Hannah has a job where she can work from home 3 days of the week, and that's when she will let Pete come over to eat, rest, shower, or do what he needs to, while her roommate is gone for work. Long story short, he became increasingly angry that he was not allowed to spend the night with her (according to him, because that's what couples do, she's supposed to look out for her man, accusing her of bringing another man over, etc.). He punched her in the arm because she suggested that he stay at a men's homeless shelter. He demanded that she get him his own apartment under her name. He then demanded that she get him a hotel room instead, but she said no because she couldn't afford it. She called me in tears last week after it had happened. She plans on staying at a women's shelter for at least another week, and is in the process of having a protective order filed against him.

I've decided to cut all contact with Pete. There is a repeated pattern of him using and disrespecting people that I can't deal with it anymore. Even though I have him blocked, his texts go into a ""blacklist"" folder that I check occasionally. Yesterday, he texted me saying that his car has been repossessed and he has no where to stay because all his friends are ignoring him too. I know he hadn't been keeping up with his car payments, but whether or not he is lying about it being repossessed, I'm just having a hard time garnering any sympathy for him. As far as I know, he is on foot using his last bit of cash to go wherever he needs to. It's hard for me to think that he could die out on these streets knowing how dangerous it gets at night, but it's probably for the best for everyone involved. My boyfriend and I are highly considering breaking our lease (we've saved up enough $$ for it) and not telling Pete where we live if we decide to move out.

I can't say that I don't feel ashamed for giving up on Pete. I'm really all he has left. My boyfriend told me that he doesn't know how either of us could be happy or safe if we allow Pete in our lives again, and I'm inclined to think that he is right. Is this wrong?

&amp;#x200B;

tl;dr - Younger brother has issues with using people and getting upset with them if he doesn't get his way. He physically abused his now ex-gf and now I don't want to help him or have anything to do with him. He has no where to stay and is about to lose his job."
27,"My (21F) older sister (26f) destroys my hobbies by upstaging me. (Very long)


Apologies for the length!

I used to write short stories in high school and post them up online. It was fun, I earned new online friends and I did well in English. I did all types of writing: flash fiction, prose, poetry, novellas and even started working on a larger novel that was an estimated 65,000&gt; words.

I kept it to myself and retrospectively, I should have continued keeping it a personal hobby because my older sister ruined it for me.

She started writing too and it was fun in the beginning to have someone to share it with. But, she started to ""upstage"" me. She would aim to write more chapters than I did, constantly brag about her readership stats and encourage the rest of my family to laugh at my stories. If I wrote romance, she would tell me I was sexually repressed. If I wrote horror or suspense, I was messed up and needed a stern talking-to. If I wrote fluff/feel-good fics, I was boring and had no imagination. If I wrote historical/sci-fi, I was being factually-incorrect or too weird.

She made me feel like whatever I did, she would always do better. She's always in competition with me, pretending to be my friend and then tearing me down. She has done this for my whole life and no one cares.

Now, she's jealous of me. She constantly asks me ""how much money do you have in your bank account, how can you afford this, why are you buying that, how much money did you get for your birthday/xmas/whatever"".

I recently bought a drawing pad with money I got for my 21st to help with graphic design and drawing for uni. The next time I visit her, she makes a show of taking me to pick up an online order in-store for her more expensive, brandname drawing pad. She complains that she has no money, but goes out of her way to buy all these expensive things to show off?

She has done this with video games, anime/manga, books, tv series, arts and crafts, music and pretty much anything else under the sun. It's not a general 'like' for the hobby either - she goes completely fangirl-bonkers over something I like and acts like it's her new, fandangle thing she has fallen in love with and she loves *so much better* than I do.

She really kills my vibe with it and puts me off doing it completely. I've been living with depression since I was 14 and it's hard to find a hobby that I want to stick with. It's worse when she comes in and tries to be better than me because I don't want to compete with her (or anyone else). I've spent most of my life comparing myself to everyone else because I think I'm not good enough and it's shitty that when I try to change myself, there she is.

She is an okay sister. She's an hour away when I live with my mother and three hours away when I'm at uni, so it's not an everyday thing. Sometimes I think that I complain about her too much, but she pulls shit like this and then I'm back to feeling like I did when I was 14, silently hating her for stirring shit. I mean, come on! She's five years older than me, married and moved out of home. Why the obsession?

Plenty of people have told me I'm overreacting. I've heard it all: ""imitation is the sincerest form of flattery"", ""sisters are meant to share hobbies"", ""you're being selfish, she's not hurting anyone"", ""I'm sure you copy her too"", ""don't be cold, she's just trying to show you that she loves you"". I'm over it. I don't need her hijacking every ounce of happiness in my life to prove she's better.

I'm trying to reconnect with my old hobbies and all these bitter-sweet memories come flooding back and put me in a pit again. I want to have her in my life but she makes my life devoid of joy and passion. It would be easier to shut her out if she was a friend or classmate, but she's my sister.

For now, I'm just trying to focus on myself. I'm starting back up with writing and drawing, and even thinking of starting a WordPress blog. It's going to take a lot to reignite my old passions and hold the depression at bay, but I can only try. I just hope my sister doesn't try to hijack everything again.

How do I deal with this?

Tl;dr when I get a new hobby, sister comes in and ruins it by belittling my talent and acting like she's better. Nobody else cares and just thinks I'm mean. Now I hate having hobbies and I'm miserable."
28,"My (28m) gf (27f) went to Vegas last summer with mostly male friends, news comes out a year later


This is a throwaway for anonymity and names have been changed

Backstory: Dating my gf Harriet for 2.5 years at the time and we are still currently dating. Her amateur billiard team (they are mostly all friends from childhood) won state championship and were awarded free trip to Las Vegas to compete in national tournament. She is the only female on the team. She did not want me to go on the trip because she said it was a team event. I wanted to go, but whatever, i hate pool and I am not really good friends with anyone on the team. Obviously I was a little nervous because she will be the only girl on a trip to Vegas with shared hotel rooms. She promises that she will not share a bed with any male because that is disrespectful to our relationship and that puts me at ease. Trip happens, one of her old friends, Mike, shows up. He is not on the pool team. She never mentioned to me he would be there until I saw him in a group picture she posted while there and she says it was a surprise. Mike lives in LA and they all grew up together. Ok fine, she says he is staying at a different hotel with a friend. She returned, they lost, everything is fine.

Fast forward to now about a year later: she tells me Saturday night, Matt had nowhere to stay and slept in her bed for 2 nights. When she told me and I confronted her about it, she thinks it is no big deal, and that she hasn't lied to me and that i am making this into a huge problem and it isn't one. I am hurt because i feel she broke a promise to me and she did not think it was important enough to tell me until now.

So Reddit, what do you think? Is there more to the story she isn't letting on? Why would she tell me now?

tl;dr gf went to Vegas on trip with all all male pool team, old male friend friend shows up announced and sleeps in gfs bed. she tells me a year later"
29,"I (28m) believe that getting married to my wife (28f) has been the single biggest mistake of my life.


This is a throwaway for obvious reasons. I have been married to my wife for going on two years. I absolutely believe it has been the biggest mistake of my life so far. I have ostracized my family (deserved) and my friends (undeserved), and my work performance has declined considerably. I went from being debt free to over 50k in debt not including my house, and the intimate side of the relationship exists maybe once a month.

She continually puts me down for my career choice (I have had an extremely successful career thus far in the enlisted side of the military) for the lack of money being able to support the quality of life that she (and I) want. She has had four jobs since we have been married, and continually quits them. It’s never her fault in her mind. She always deserves more for the effort she puts in, even though she would continually call off or be late. 

I transferred my GI Bill that would pay for her college to her, and support her trying to be a writer off of my pay check so that she could have a career that she wants. However, it has continually been brought up that she has given up all of her career in retail to move out to shit military towns to follow my career which won’t support the quality of life we want. I offer to get out of the military and it’s simply an unrealistic option given the financial situation.

I’m not perfect, and I know this. I work 60 to 80 hour weeks, so I am away from home quite a bit. I am so burnt out from work that some simple tasks I truly forget to do. I have been brought up to be emotionally distant, which I know is not healthy in a relationship. I have started counseling though. I offered for it to be together as marriage counseling, but nope, she refuses. I don’t think she believes she has ever done anything wrong. She has threatened divorce three times in the past.

Overall the last month has been better in terms of arguments, but I am still unhappy. Where I’m fucked up is that I go out of my way to pretend to show that I love her, and that nothing is wrong. I try and cuddle, I kiss on her, I do everything I can to help out, but deep down, all I want to do is leave. But I’m guilted because she has nothing. She moved out to a military town where she has one friend, no job, no degree, and no money. I frankly don’t know what to do because I do care about her, so I continue to pretend nothing is wrong.

&amp;#x200B;

**TL;DR** I am pretending to be happily married when in fact I think it has been the biggest mistake of my life."
30,"19 Me [42/F] with my husband [54 M] 18 yrs, lots of petty shit and some major issues. How do I say I want a divorce?


I’m not willing to work on it anymore. The tv issue is dumb and disrespectful. He also refuses to stop eating in the bedroom. He’s gained a good 100lbs and will not take care of himself. He won’t cook for himself or clean up after himself. 

His passive aggressiveness doesn’t stop there. He gives me the silent treatment when he’s mad. We don’t have a sex life. I don’t know if he can live on his own. He’s obviously not good at taking care of himself and he also doesn’t make enough money to live on his own. But I’m DONE. 

TLDR: Too much petty bullshit plus some major issues. DO NOT WABT to be married. How do I say I’m out?"
31,"Best Friend Cut Me Off For Not Reacting The Way She Wanted Me To To Her Engagement


Hi all, I'm wondering if this has happened to any of you and if you can explain why this may be happening. I'm extremely confused and upset.

My best friend from college of ten years (27F) and I (28F) live in separate states. She just got engaged. I thought everything went pretty well when she told me the news - she texted me to call her, so I left a voicemail, texted, we chatted on the phone, I left her a video, liked all her social posts, everything. In my voicemail I did state that I couldn't talk for long and that if we didn't chat on the phone we could the next day. We did however end up speaking on the phone. I congratulated her and all that.

A few days later I sent her a message thanking her for understanding my low energy on the call and that I didn't want that to be translated into me not being excited for her. I had just gotten back from a trip and I was mentally and physically exhausted. I knew my friend was getting engaged so I wasn't surprised either.

About a week later she sends me an email (she hadn't been responding to my message) saying that she needs space. She says that I wasn't there for her in the way she needed and deserved during her special time of engagement. She says that she disappointed in my reaction. She says I didn't show that I wanted to hear the special news when she called. She says that this has 'consequences that you did not intend for.'

I'm... So confused. I feel like I did everything I was supposed to do and I all but apologized when I told her my reaction may have been off due to my low energy. I also felt like the email was extremely patronizing - saying I'm now suffering from consequences I wasn't aware of so now I'll need to take space.

Am I missing something or is my friend totally out of line? I'm extremely hurt and I think about this every day. I haven't spoken to her in weeks now. Prior to this everything was fine and I can't tell if she's projecting?

I'm at the point where I feel like I deserve an apology for being treated this way. However my friends are like family to me and they mean everything to me. This particular person has a history of cutting people off. I just never thought I would be caught in the line of fire. And why me?

TL;DR! best friend cut me off after I didn't react the way she wanted me to to her engagement"
32,"My best friend [26 M] cheated on his girl. How do I tell her without losing our friendship?


Basically I have been friends with a guy since middle school, and he’s my closest friend. He has been dating on and off with another one of our friends. Basically they date for a months/a year then breakup for a few weeks/months and get back together. It’s like a cycle. The last time they broke up “for good” my best friend tried seeing other people and found this really nice girl he started dating. I really thought they were a good match and she treated him really well. 2 months into his relationship with her, he calls me to tell me they broke up and he is back with his ex (the one that’s been on and off with him). I asked what happened and he said that him and his ex went to get drinks to catch up and went to her apartment together. Things started getting a little touchy and they were both in bed naked. His ex told him if he wanted her he had to call his gf and break up then and there. So my friend called his gf and broke up over the phone with her so he could have sex and be with his ex. He didn’t tell her why he broke up with her and just said it was because he wasn’t ready for a relationship. I found this absolutely awful and felt really bad for his girlfriend as she was great and such a genuinely sweet person. 2 days later his ex breaks up with him and says she’s not ready for another relationship with him. So then, he calls up his gf of 2 months and tells her he was sorry and confused and wants to get back together. She agreed and they’re back together now but I feel awful knowing he cheated and is still dating her and she has no idea. He’s my closest friend and I don’t want to lose our friendship but I feel guilty whenever we hangout together because she seems to genuinely really like him. How do I approach this? Is there any way of telling her without losing him as a friend?

TLDR; he cheated on his girlfriend and now I’m unsure how to approach this without losing our friendship. We’re really close longtime best friends."
33,"BIL (M/34) being weird to me, his brothers wife (F/38)


At a family get together on Friday my brother in law (M/34) said and did some things that were a bit off. When we were talking about my husband (M/40) being away on business this week he said ""oh so do want me to come over then while he's away then?"" I just said no way I'm looking forward to a few nights by myself! Then later when he was leaving he came to find me in the kitchen as I was washing dishes to say goodbye, he gave me a hug which is usual but he also kissed me on the neck just below and sort of behind my ear. Which felt a bit intimate.

He has done stuff like that before trying to flirt with me or cop a feel but usually when he is really drunk and he makes a big joke out of it but he wasn't drunk at all on friday. He is married himself and his wife (F/33) is heavily pregnant at the moment and was there on friday. In the past my husband has had to speak to his brother about his behaviour but he has typically been a lot better of late. 

For context I have been with  my husband since I was 17 and have known my brother in law since he was 13.

At this stage it feels like a long running joke but it also sometimes feels like he is trying his luck and I'd just be curious to what others think about this? For the record I am not attracted to him.

Tl;dr: BIL (M/34) always paws at me and flirts when he is drunk its made out to be a joke but started to do so when sober and it feels weird."
34,"My [23F] boyfriend's [M24] mom said something inappropriate to me, and everyone thinks it is ok.


My boyfriend and I have been dating for almost 6 years.  He is very busy, and I oftentimes cook for him and make him meals to put in the freezer so he can eat something homemade as opposed to fast food when he gets home late or has a lot of work to do.  These are typically foods that are healthy (vegetable soups, curries, vegetable chili, etc). Sometimes, I will make something unhealthy if we have food about to spoil that needs to be used up (for example, mac and cheese to use up milk and cheese).  This is a very small portion of the meals, as they are mostly healthy with lots of vegetables.  One time, his parents visited and saw all of the portioned meals in the freezer. His mom turned to me and told me that I was killing him by making him fat (my boyfriend has been overweight ever since before I knew him). I explained that these were healthy foods that I made and put into portion control sizes for him so he has an alternative to fast food.  She again repeated that I was killing him by cooking for him.  She was not joking or kidding around.  This upset me a great amount because I spend a lot of time and money preparing these foods for him.  I feel like her comment was completely out of line.  Both her and my boyfriend fail to see why I am upset by this comment.  Am I overreacting by being upset? How do I handle this situation? Thank you

&amp;#x200B;

35,"Coworker [40sF] won't stop talking and I [30sF] have tried EVERYTHING


Please, please, please help me.

&amp;#x200B;

So I've been sharing an office with a coworker (let's call her Jane) for about a year now.  Jane is EXTREMELY extroverted. I am  EXTREMELY introverted. Seeing as my irritation could be fueled by my own idiosyncrasies, I've tried to keep myself  in check by being extraordinarily patient with all of her chatter... but she chatters NON-STOP... ALL DAY LONG.

  
For illustrate my point: I can listen to whatever I want while working. One day I tried to listen to a 15 minute youtube video. I was not able to get through that until noon. I started listening to it at 7am. **In 5 hours I got 15 minutes of uninterrupted time TOTAL.**

&amp;#x200B;

Things I've tried:

&amp;#x200B;

* If I put on my headphones, Jane will either: tap me on the shoulder, stand next to my computer screen until I'm forced to acknowledge her or swing her chair around until she's directly beside me  until I'm forced to acknowledge her.
* If I stop responding to her or try to ignore her, Jane will ask ""did you hear what I said?""
* If I tell her I have that I'm swamped and have a lot of work to do right then so I can't talk right now, she *might* give me 30-60 minutes before she starts talking again.
* When I suggest black-out periods for longer periods of time because I'm getting farther behind, it's not long before she forgets and/or reverts back to her old habits. Furthermore, conversations regarding how she's falling behind as well are met with, ""I could go faster if I stopped talking but I don't want to work like that.""

&amp;#x200B;

I reached my breaking point when I told her directly that ""I cannot talk about \[this subject\] anymore and I have to get my work done."" She responded by getting quiet... and then **MOTHER-FREAKING TEXTING ME** while she was sitting directly behind me.

&amp;#x200B;

TL; DR: I like Jane very much, and I don't want to hurt her. I also would rather not get her in trouble or make her look bad by involving my boss. She doesn't respect my headphones as a symbol or silence and I am most definitely communicating my needs directly to her. What else can I do?"
36,"i (24F) am starting to realize that I am too good for my boyfriend (25M) but I just can’t break it off.


I don’t mean this in a stuck up way. And not by looks in any means. If anything he may even be slightly more attractive than me. 


What I mean is that I’m starting to just notice things that really aren’t.. well.. good. We’ve been dating about 10 months and it’s been obvious since the 2nd month of dating he is a very insecure and jealous guy. He questions every time I talk to a male and thinks I flirt with guys often because I mess with my earrings or my hair (truly a habit, my parents tell me I do it too). 


He is just really judgmental. He makes comments on everything everyone does that’s wrong and that’s just not me at all. And he does give off the “better than you” vibe sometimes. He’s a pretty negative guy which isn’t me either. And even though he seems to be the more possessive one, he also can be really inconsiderate to my feelings and the way he does things and says things. Things that I know he’d be so mad at me if I did. (i.e. going out with friends and not texting me back for 3 hours with his location off)(just happened right now)



To clarify, I trust him and know he’s not cheating or doing anything like that but what makes me so angry is if I did that, it would be a huge deal to him. But when he does it, it’s just an “oh sorry I totally have not been checking my phone!”. It’s crazy cuz normally, with the amount that I trust him, I wouldn’t be mad at all. Hell I’ve gone out with friends and just not looked at my phone due to a good time and was definitely not cheating. But it’s the fact that I know he would be mad at me that makes me want to just get so mad and start a fight and just shake him and say “how can you not see this?!” 



And I’m not trying to say I’m this perfect person! But I know that I am confident in who I am. I know that I’m at least good looking and I work really hard at taking care of myself (gym, health, sleep, work/ social balance). I am really not and have never been a judgemental person. People are just doing their own things and unless I really really know you I don’t feel I can make assumptions about you. I am generally a positive, find happiness in the little things kinda girl and unfortunately my boyfriend is kinda opposite those things.. 




After reading this you’re probably like, dude! Break up with him! But on the other side of things.... I have truly never felt like any of my past boyfriends loved me as much as he does. I’ve always been the one to care more. And for the first time I truly feel my boyfriend cares so much about me. He is one of the funniest people I know and we can be weird and make each other laugh. He really listens to me and tries to help me through my problems and i think i do the same to him.


And like I said, I’m not perfect. I know I could be less argumentative and sensitive about little things. I know I get upset with him easier and find it hard to forgive quickly. But I do genuinely feel I am a good girlfriend to him and he always tells me how much he admires me as a person and it’s sad to say that I don’t feel I can say the same about him which I feel so mean even typing.. 



Unfortunately lately it seems like his negatives are starting to outweigh the positives in my eyes and it sucks cuz he’s not a horrible guy. But I’m just kinda feeling like this isn’t this great guy that I want to end up with. I know nobody is perfect but I don’t think that asking for a trusting, confident, nonjudgmental nice guy is a lot to ask for right? (Lol or is that a joke). Idk. Maybe this is just a phase or a bump. I don’t want to start to resent him and stay with him and prolong this if it isn’t meant for me but I can’t seem to break up with him cuz it’s not like his negatives are horrible things and when he’s his best self just hanging and cracking jokes I really just love being with him. But it’s also not “I hate the way he leaves his dishes in the sink or chomps his food!” It’s like his actual personality traits... is this something all couples gotta just get past. It has been less than a year. Any advice?




TLDR; 

I’m starting to really dislike the negative traits my boyfriend has. I’m wondering if this is a phase and a bump couples go through or if he isn’t the guy for me."
37,"My Mom gave my fiancée [25f] a wedding gift and wants it back


My mother is a recovering alcoholic. When she was drinking, she gave my fiancée a necklace to wear for our wedding and keep as a wedding gift. 

Now, several weeks before our wedding, she is saying she “loaned” the necklace and did not intend for it to be a gift at all. Then she went on to say that my fiancée should apologize for misremembering things...

The rest of my family is also backing my mom up on this, insisting we are misremembering, which is infuriating because my mom was not sober then and they know this. 

My fiancée plans to return the necklace, and will no longer wear it to the wedding. But my mom isn’t having it, she now says she should keep it, and is playing the victim...but still demands an apology.

Married for 3 months, dating just shy of 4 years. We'd both agreed early on that we wanted kids. She recently told me that she's changed her mind, that given the current state of the planet, it would be irresponsible to have children. That if we really wanted what was best for our future children, we wouldn't have them. She's also opposed to adopting a baby, citing corruption and exploitation. She wants to foster children who will have a harder time getting adopted. I think this will be a huge pain in the ass. We don't know anything about children, and aren't trained to take on difficult ones. She isn't willing to compromise. Where do I go from here?

39,"My (24f) husbands (27m) money management skills are really making it hard to see a future with him


A little background: we got married super young. I’m almost 24, he’s 27. Been married almost 5 years. The first 4 years together we lived rent free in his parents guest house. At the time I was making $36k/yr and he was making $24k/yr. we racked up some serious credit cards debt, young and dumb. He had about $30k in cc’s at the time and I had about $10k.

My mother in law passed away and left my husband $90k. We paid off our debt, moved across county to my home state and starting renting our first apartment. I found a job immediately. I’m making a little over $100k/year now. He spent 7 months unemployed and blew thru all of the money his mom left him. He’s finally found a job and makes $30k/year. He’s not a very hard worker and is totally fine with calling out of work quite often. 

I pay all the bills. Every single one. Rent, daycare, car, our insurance, the loan I took out to consolidate his cc debt a year ago, electric, water, you name it. I pay for it. Obviously I don’t mind paying the majority of the bills since I make a lot more. He has no drive to find a better paying job to help me. He’s also racked up another $15k in cc debt. I have 0 cc debt and pay everything with cash I have in my debit card. 

My husband eats out for basically 3 meals a day. He doesn’t see a problem in this. He’s fine with using his credit card to buy action figures and whatever games he want as soon as it comes out. His truck payment is $610 a month so really after his truck payment and his minimum payments on his cc’s, all of his money is gone. He will not be able to pay off his debt. I think he’s just waiting to his depressed father to die to receive another lump sum of cash.

I’m starting to resent the irresponsibility on his end and would appreciate any advice I could get.

Tl;dr my husband sucks at managing money and I don’t know what I should do"
40,"I (27F) haven't had sex with my boyfriend (28M) in over 3 years. There are just so many issues and I don't know if it is worth trying to salvage the relationship


*Already posted this in* deadbedrooms *but thought maybe I might receive some advice or insight here*

I've (27F) been with my boyfriend (28M) for about 3.5 years. At the start everything was fine - the sex was ok but we really connected on an emotional level which was enough to overcome the mediocre sex. I assumed that things would get better the longer we were together as we got to know each other's preferences.

We moved in together after we had been dating for about 6 months. By this point all intimacy had stopped; tbh I thought moving in together would help as we would have privacy and time together.

Fast forward to now - we have been together for over 3.5 years and there is literally nothing going on in the bedroom. We haven't had sex since before the 6 month mark. The last time we did anything sexual (a blowjob) was about 3 months ago.

I have tried talking about it so many times but I feel like I am just talking to a brick wall. He gets upset and shuts down and won't say anything. When I push him he'll just reply with ""well what do you want me to say?"" I stopped caring so long ago but then I found this sub and now I'm just feeling so bummed about the whole situation.

He smokes weed every day, which he knows I hate. When we started dating we smoked it together a lot, but as the years went by I went back to college for my masters and stopped being such a total dropkick. I don't smoke or do any drugs anymore and I have asked him so many times to cut back. Once he stopped smoking for about 2 weeks to prove that he could then celebrated by spending two days chain smoking joints.

He grew out his hair and I find it just so unattractive. At first I never said anything because like, I respect his bodily autonomy. But it has become such a sticking point for me. He is losing his hair and it just looks thin and greasy all the time. I hate it. I drop hints about hairstyles that would look good and he gets angry at me about it.

He doesn't brush his teeth. This has been a huge issue over the three years and every time I try to make him brush his teeth he has like a childish tantrum. He stinks of weed and smelly breath and then he tries to kiss me and I just cringe away. He ""compromised"" by brushing his teeth most nights and acts like it's a massive achievement when my 3-year-old nephew has better oral hygiene.

And finally - he has phimosis and refuses to do anything about it. I have booked him doctors' appointments to discuss options. I have bought him special silicone rings to help stretch the skin. He does nothing.

I even got him to see a psychologist who specialises in sexual health - he went once and never again.

So yeah. The DB goes both ways I guess. He never wants sex/won't have it because of the phimosis but he won't do anything about it. I find him kind of gross these days. Being with him makes me feel so goddamn unattractive that I've relapsed back into an eating disorder because my crazy brain tells me that maybe he would want to touch me if I weigh &lt;100lbs.

Fuck me, typing this out just makes this sound like a joke. Why the fuck am I with him? What do I do?? How do I break up with someone when we have a lease together? Neither of us could afford the place alone. The lease runs out in a few months, am I a bad person if I'm just ""holding on"" until then????

**tl;dr in a sad, sexless relationship with a guy who I think I've outgrown. I don't want to break up but I don't know how to resolve anything**"
41,"My (24F) boyfriend (31m) gets angry a lot. This time it's about mistaking his voice in a video game. Am I crazy?


Writing this on mobilw, throwaway, yada yada yada.

My boyfriend and I play a lot of video games, especially online games. It's how we spend time together, especially after work. 

We were playing in different parts of the map, and I heard someone over microphone make a panicked yell. I immediately asked over Discord if my boyfriend needed me to rotate to that part of the map and help him. He started getting upset and saying, ""No...that wasn't me. It was [insert name of character played by another player]."" Basically, another player on our team made a little yelp and I thought it was my boyfriend. 

I said sorry, that I made a mistake, and kept playing. Throughout the game, he kept asking me why I thought that voice was him. I started getting anxious, but responded that I hadn't properly processed the voice and because I had been so focused on the game, thought that voice might have been him.

After the game, he asked me again. He got angrier and angrier as our conversation went on. He said, ""how could you think that voice sounded like me?"" (The particular player had a nasaly voice and sounded nothing like him).

I tried to explain, but then he interrupted me multiple times and then yelled: 

""My point is that you f*ing thought that p*ssy sounded like me. Do you think that sounds like me? Do you know what my voice sounds like?"" 

He gets really scary when he's angry. I usually get mad and start crying. I didn't think this situation warranted that severe of a reaction, but this happens all the time over little things, like things I say, things I forget to say, things I get anxious about. I have PMDD, and I get more anxious before my period, and he says because of that, he gets angrier. So I just try to diffuse things every time it happens. 

When this happens, I eventually just get a panic attack. He's been getting better with his anger (he used to throw things and punch holes into furniture), but he only yells now.

Now I'm sitting in the bathtub and crying. He knows this means my alone time and space so he leaves me be. But after a while he will come in, and he'll want to resolve things and I'm not ready. I say I want physical space, and he gets mad asking ""Why, do you think I'll hurt you? What do you think I'll do?"" 

And I just answer no, I just want space because I'm freaked out and not ready. And he says, ""Do you hate my presence? Is that why?"" And he says it in such a scary way that even if I don't feel good saying it, I just say back,"" Of course I love your presence. I'm just scared right now.""

We have these similar exchanges a lot. I feel guilted into saying something that I may believe, but don't want to say at the moment because I'm upset. But if I don't say it, he keeps asking and blows up.

I'm not sure what to do, honestly. Every time this happens I want to leave. And by leave, I mean _leave_. But we have been together for over 5 years and I do love him -- he's very nice and kind when he isn't mad. He's just mad a lot and I get scared when he's mad. He gets mad when I say he gets mad a lot or all the time, so I change it to ""you get mad frequently"".

Honestly, I feel like I put a lot in this relationship. I think about this every time I get in these moods. I have been paying for everything right now, since he's been making very little (not going to mention his profession, since it would be too identifying at this point), and I do make a lot more. I pay for rent, internet, utilities, food incidentals, flights, even some of his work stuff.

He doesn't like it when I say it's my money, because since we are planning to get married, it should be our money. And he doesn't like it when I accidentally say it's ""my cat"" or ""my apartment"" or ""my mom"" because he has an insecurity about things not being ours. He gets mad when I say he has an insecurity, but it's true. He does. I don't know if saying that is wrong. And if I accidentally say ""I"" instead of ""our"", I have to apologise. He has a lot of other little rules, but he calls them preferences. Some rules (he also doesn't like it when I call them rules. They're ""preferences"" But they feel like rules, sometimes) include, always saying an endearment after a sentence starts with ""let's..."", or not saying ""I don't know"" as a figure of speech, not saying we are having an ""argument"", but a ""heated discussion"", and other little things. He says I don't have to follow these rules if I don't want to. He just gets sad if I don't and it knots his stomach up. So I say these things because I love him. But sometimes I forget. I forget, then he gets mad, but he tells me he's working on not being as mad. And he has been getting better, and being more understanding when I make a mistake. 

In terms of money, he said he would pay for me if I was making less. I believe him, but I'm also just frustrated at that also since I'm not saving as much as I want. We are planning a move soon across the country for his new job, and I'm paying for all of that too. He will be making slightly more money when we move (just not a lot still), and he said that will be a net gain in the end. 

I'm feeling a lite resentful about the move since I'll be leaving all my friends here, and although the move will be closer to my brother, I feel a little scared and upset, and I'm not sure if I'm crazy or not anymore, or if I have a right to feel this way.

I talked to my psychiatrist when I gave his mom a few grand because she was in debt. She said it's not strange to think of it as ""our money"" but I didn't have to. But I don't want to be not giving. I don't want to not help him out when he's in need when clearly I can help. 

Anyway, eventually, when I leave the bathtub and we talk, we do resolve things. I want to make a post like this, but then I never do because I forget about it until the next time. I'm just wondering if I'm crazy. Am I crazy? Am I thinking too much? Am I too resentful and selfish? Is this a normal relationship? Is it healthy and he just has an anger problem he's trying to fix? He doesn't hit me, ever. He doesn't verbally abuse me or call me names. I just feel drained.

TL;DR: boyfriend gets mad over me mistaking his voice in a video game. I get scared. Is it normal?"
42,"My [29F] husband [30M] has slept with another woman, and I have decided to end our marriage.


Warning: this is looooooong.

I’ve been with my husband for nearly 10 years, since we were early 20’s and yesterday he admitted he had a one night stand with a girl he met in a club. 

In the interest of complete transparency here, our marriage hasn’t been great lately (it’s not been awful though either), we’ve become complacent and a bit boring, existing as a couple rather than truly living as one. We’re still having sex at least twice/three times a week, even if I’m not in the mood we’ll do other acts to satisfy him (he has a very high sex drive) and whilst I thought we were a bit “blah” lately I put it down to us being together 10 years and just letting general life get in the way of our relationship. Both of us are equally to blame for this slump.

Two weeks ago today, I was at a concert with my friends having the time of my life. We had moved away from our hometown but were both back for a weekend out with friends. My husband was out with his friends in a different town that night, due to be staying at his best friends house and I knew he was very drunk, his texts to me were complete gibberish but this is normal for him, he has a wild party side and only drinks to get very, very drunk. He doesn’t do it a lot and I’ve never had an issue with him letting off steam with his friends before. As a side note, the best friend he was out with cheated on his wife after a year of marriage and has bounced from relationship to relationship since - cheating on them, always texting other girls and generally being an asshole to women. I’ve always been hesitant for him to go out with this friend because their nights out have ended in trouble before. My husband admits that when he’s out with this friend, he makes bad decisions that he wouldn’t normally make with other friends.

Around 2am I was texting my husband, he tells me he’s at his friends new girlfriends house and they’re having drinks. This is fine, I’m not a wife who doesn’t let my husband speak to other women, or demands he be home at a certain time. I ask him what time he’s picking me up in the morning (I was staying at my best friends house and he was meant to pick me up the next morning to take us to see my parents and grandparents) and he says he’ll see me at around 9am.

The next morning I text him at 10am as I’ve not heard anything but after his texts last night I imagine he’s just waiting to sober up before driving. I get no reply. I try calling, his phone goes straight to voicemail. I message the friend he’s with, no reply to that either. Eventually I call his friend and he puts me on the phone to my husband. He’s still at the girlfriends house, and his phone is out of battery. I don’t bat an eyelid at this, I presume he’s stayed over because his friend wanted to be with his girlfriend instead of going back to his house. I ask what time he’ll be picking me up and he doesn’t even know what time it is now, I tell him it is 11am and he is shocked, he’s just woken up and doesn’t think he’s sober enough to drive yet. My husband usually wakes up around 7am every day, regardless of whether he’s been out drinking, and for him to be a) still sleeping at 11am and b) still blowing high numbers on the breathalyser makes it very obvious he was drinking until the early morning. He says it was a great night, he’s accidentally broken his glasses and that he drank 2 bottles of wine, countless cocktails and vodka, and got into the whiskey after leaving the club and going to his friends girlfriends house (no wonder he couldn’t drive until 1pm!!). We text for a bit, I tell him my dad is going to pick me up and I’ll meet him back at my dads house once he’s sober enough to drive.

He arrives around 2pm and heads straight for the shower, he’s a bit quiet but I presume that’s the hangover kicking in and that he’s feeling rough. Over that day and night he’s behaving very strange, very quiet and doesn’t talk much to me, my parents or my grandparents who we visit later in the day. Once again, I presume it’s the hangover from hell and don’t question it.

The next day we go to a cabin for a week as a “staycation”, he’s generally ok for the first few days, he drinks A LOT during these days and puts away multiple bottles of wine on two nights, and nearly a whole bottle of vodka on the third night but is still in a good mood. We have oral sex and penetrative sex (unprotected as I’m on the contraceptive pill, this is important later). Towards the half way point he starts to get moody and withdrawn, saying he’s not enjoying the holiday and that he wants to go home. I agree because I’ve come down with an awful cold and can’t get off the sofa for any longer than 5 minutes. We head home 2 days early and life is normal for the next week, we have work and get on well. 

This Thursday we have sex, I’ve not been feeling great due to the cold but on Thursday the fog is lifting and we get intimate, once again no protection as I’m on the pill. On Friday morning, we go to work and my husband is going out that night with work friends so won’t be home until later. I agree I’ll pick him up and tell him to text me when he’s ready to come home. At 10pm I collect him and once again he’s very drunk, he goes to bed and completely conks out. This is the part I’m not proud of...

I knew something has been weird since that night he went out with his friends. He’s been running a lot, going to the gym and generally trying to be out the house as much as possible. I didn’t expect he’d cheated but I wanted to put my mind at rest so I look through his phone. Major red flag - he’s deleted his what’s app chat with the best friend he was out with. He doesn’t delete WhatsApp chats, EVER. This puts me on high alert as I’m not sure why he’d delete that chat if it didn’t contain evidence of something he didn’t want me to know (I have all his passwords to his phone, as he has mine but we’re not a couple that needs to check all the time as I thought we had complete understanding that cheating was a dealbreaker for both of us). So I check his actual messages, nothing in there. My husband has a habit of accidentally screenshotting his phone screen when he doesn’t mean to (half his pictures are genuinely screenshots of texts, or webpages that he’s accidentally screenshot whilst using his phone). So I decide to see if he’s accidentally screenshot the WhatsApp chat he deleted with his friend. He hasn’t but I do find something that makes my heart drop to my stomach. 

I find a picture of an email to a girl called Lisa (not her real name), sent 2 days after this night out. In this email he says “sorry for rushing off on Sunday morning, that’s not the way I’d liked to have ended the night” and “hope you had a good night, it was very good”. He’s obviously emailed her and taken a picture of this to send to his friend. He’s used his work email because he knows it doesn’t flash up on his phone like texts or WhatsApp. 

I find more emails, she’s responded saying it was a good night but nothing more incriminating. I found the email from him to his friend asking for Lisa’s email address as he “hated rushing off like that and he wanted to apologise”. Finally, I find an email from that very night, two hours before he was picked up by me saying “I just wanted you to know I think you’re absolutely stunning and I hope to see you again” followed by another email 30 minutes later saying “like really fucking hot”. That’s it. He has definitely cheated on me. 

I wake him up and ask him if he slept with Lisa. He says no, repeatedly, and I start screaming at him to tell me because I’ve seen the emails and I know he’s done it. He admits it, he slept with another woman and my heart shatters on the spot. I let out the most animalistic noise I’ve ever heard and didn’t think was possible for myself to make. I demand he gets out of bed now and tell me everything.

Over the next 9 hours I hear how he met her at 1am in the club, and the “chemistry” they had was undeniable, he knew they were going to fuck that night because he fancied her more than me and that he didn’t think of me, or the fact he was married, at all whilst he was fucking her. He fucked her without a condom, she gave him a blowjob and he performed oral sex on her as well (hence why I am now having to go to the sexual health clinic to make sure I haven’t caught anything). He lied about using a condom 5 times before he admitted he didn’t use one (which to me is an ultimate lack of respect for me, when I could have caught an STI he decides to put himself first and try to bullshit me about having a condom in his wallet - I’ve been with this dumbass for 10 years, he’s never had a condom in there!). He blamed my weight and my anxiety for our marriage troubles (I’ve had severe anxiety issues for the last 2 years and he has never offered an iota of support, which he did admit to. I’ve put on 2 stone in the time we’ve been together - he has put on 4 stone in the same time!!) and that he’s not been happy for 6 months (news to me!). He says he was unhappy at the cabin because of the fact he cheated that night and that he drank so much to get his mind off it. He doesn’t want a divorce, he loves me but knew the minute he did it that I was going to leave him. At first he was petulant and seemed bored by the conversation (possibly alcohol induced at that time) but by the end he was sobbing as much as me. He knows he has fucked up and can’t give me any other reason than “I just really fancied her and she really fancied me” for taking a sledgehammer to our marriage. The final nail is the coffin for me was realising he’d sent the email to her apologising for rushing off WHILST SITTING NEXT TO ME. Worst of all he actually said “I almost told you that first night in the cabin” but instead he sent her than email and decided to take a risk I wouldn’t find out about any of this. The last emails about how he hoped to see her again were 2 hours before I picked him up that very night. He hadn’t text me at all that night, I clearly was not on his mind at all.

This man, I loved him from the moment we got together. I sang his praises to everyone, I supported him through job loss, two master degrees, a car crash and paid for nearly everything for the best part of 8 years. I gave him everything I have, mentally, physically and financially. I knew the marriage wasn’t as good as it had been but I don’t believe we were not in love. I don’t believe he was sex deprived. I think he wanted someone to make him feel like I did, 10 years ago before real life bills, stress, jobs, pets, etc got in the way and he wasn’t my sole focus day in day out.

I am 48 hours now from the moment I found out and currently am feeling extremely numb. There is no pain, only emptiness. I have used the word “gut wrenching” very flippantly in the past, but after feeling like someone was ripping every organ in my body out my throat yesterday I now know the true meaning of that phrase. I wanted to lie on the floor because the pain was too much but I knew if I did I’d never get up, so I kept fucking standing. 

Every piece of my body wants to hold him and tell him it’s going to be ok, he was my best friend and I truly saw us being together forever. My brain however is trying to remind me of the fact he emailed her wishing to see her again, he barely apologised throughout our whole conversation, and he didn’t promise it would never happen again (when I asked him if he could ever say he’d never do it again his answer was - and I swear to god this is verbatim - “well I won’t be out in *town he met her in* any time soon” ... ARE YOU FUCKING KIDDING ME?! That’s your answer to that question?!). 

For the first time in 10 years I have decisions to make, by myself. I have no idea what I’m going to do with my (unwanted) fresh start at life. I am 30 in 5 months and am devastated my best friend isn’t going to walk into my third decade with me. My family have been amazing thus far and say they support whatever I want. I’ve not told my friends yet and am too humiliated to right now, but I know they will be right behind me too. 

The next few weeks (months??) will be tough, and I really hope that in the darkest moments I remember that this isn’t my fault, I didn’t deserve this and I don’t have to let this define the rest of my life. 

It’s really, really fucking shit though.

TLDR: my husband cheated on me, aka - how to wreck a marriage in just 3 hours!"
43,"My (24F) husband (24M) of less than a month threw something out the window for no reason, to hit a guy below? WTF?


(Recently married, together for around two and a half years total)

I took a shower this morning and when I went into our room after, it was just in time to see my husband fling an object out the open window, then there was a scream down below. We live on the 6th floor of a building. I saw a guy crouched on the sidewalk on the other side of the street holding his arm. I do not know what my husband threw. He refuses to tell me and I haven't noticed anything missing.

So, what the fuck? I immediately demanded to know what I'd just seen and why he did it. He insisted I was mistaken, that the guy had just tripped by himself at the same time my husband was opening the window. No, I know what I saw - the window was already open (screen included, we never put the screens up) and I caught him right in the moment he had his arm way back. Followed by an obvious, intentional, throwing motion. 

I told him to stop lying and explain. That started a half hour back and forth argument of him continuing to try to convince me I'd seen it wrong.

He eventually admitted there had been something in his hand but that it was just garbage and he was dropping it to the curb below. More bullshit. But this is the story he's sticking to. He won't tell me what the thing was. He will not say why he threw it, as that would involve telling the truth.

He has now avoided me all day. He had work, but then tonight he's been at the bar with some friends. I sent two texts pushing the issue that he didn't answer, the third text today was me asking where he was once it was 9pm, and he followed his response about the bar with a link to a facebook post he knew I'd be interested in, and also asking if I need any groceries as he's going to do a run before he comes home. To me this all feels like he's trying to act as if it never happened, get me to drop the subject for something else.

I assume he'll be home any time now and I don't know what to do. He seems determined not to talk about it. It's making me feel like I'll be crazy if I keep bringing it up. But what the hell? Don't I have a reasonable right to know why my husband hurled something out a window at a random stranger??

What should I do here?

TL;DR: I walked in on my husband throwing something out our bedroom window and hitting a dude across the street. He won't explain anything."
44,"I am worried about a new guy I’m dating because my ex said I smelled terribly


I’m interested in having sex with a guy I’m dating, but I am super paranoid about my smell now. My ex said I smelled terrible, I got tested for BV (didn’t have or yeast) and am very clean. My gynecologist said he was an asshole and I should dump him, because I had no odor. My ex was most likely being an extreme asshole, but now I just don’t want to have sex with anyone because of fear. My diet has changed completely, it’s very clean and I’m completely plant based. I lost some weight too and feel I look good/feel great otherwise. I like only want to have sex if I can wash for like 30 minutes before (not practical).

Tdlr; my ex said I smelled terribly and I’m worried about sex with a guy I really like and don’t want to be intimate"
45,"The older we get, the more my husband (33M) and I (34F) are finding that we're becoming increasingly isolated without having any friends. How do we get around this?


My husband and I have been married around eleven years now.  Now that we're in our mid thirties, it just seems like a lot of other people in life are starting to pass us by and leave us behind.  We opted early on that we didn't want to have kids, and neither of us have ever really been workahaulics or overly-networky.  Kind of doing our own thing has sort of put us into an area where we're kind of alone now.

Just about everyone we knew from high school, college, and even later on have also gotten married and now even have kids sometimes as old as middle school age.  Ever seeing them anymore is a huge challenge as we're always a way lower priority to sports games, dance recitals, and all sorts of things like that.  Anyone who hasn't had kids seems to always be super into things like coworking groups, MLM schemes, or whatever else.  We always make an effort to try and invite people out or to our house, but there's always something more important to us.

It's kind of hurtful that whenever we do get to hang out with someone, they tend to want something out of us or use us for something.  My husband and I have been blessed to do fairly good in life, and having dual incomes with no kids certainly helps.  For example, if we're offering to pay for a hotel room for a weekend out, people tend to show up.  If we just want someone to hang out with on a Saturday night either at our place or out for dinner, everyone suddenly has something better to do. 

We've tried getting out there and trying to meet new people of course, but that's been a huge challenge too.  We've been to board game nights, workshops, classes, meetups, even tried meeting friends on apps like Bumble.  It just always feels super awkward and we've never really hit it off with anyone at all.  We've both also tried doing some of these things individually on our own instead of as a couple and haven't had any luck either.

It also is a little annoying that as a married couple, we're expected to only behave a certain way and only be interested in certain things.  I've lost count of how many times we haven't been invited to something because people assumed we wouldn't be interested, how many times there's been conversations we were left out of because it was assumed we'd be ""too innocent"" for as a married couple.

It's all just super frustrating and I'm not sure what to do.  Can anyone offer any advice on this?

TLDR - My husband and I are having such a hard time meeting anyone to have a real connection with and are becoming increasingly isolated.  We tend to not have any friends to hang out with unless they have something to gain from us, and we seem to have an expectation to only act a certain way as a married couple.  It's really frustrating and I don't know how to get out of this."
46,"Me (24M) and my wife (23F) are both virgins but I wish we could change that


Our 3 year anniversary is approaching next month, and I feel really sad that we’ve never had sex. When we started dating in high school, we would make out infrequently and it made me excited to eventually have sex. Unfortunately that opportunity never came. I used to try to make little flirty comments, and compliment her on her looks, but she would always get mad at me about that so I stopped. When we were getting close to getting married I would sometimes start to touch her, kind of nudging towards more sexual touching. Never going further than her boundaries, but kinda lightly testing them, and it would always end in her yelling at me, and her not talking to me for a few hours. I mean, I guess it’s fair of her to not want to have sex, but I wish she would talk to me about it so I could understand. I’ve tried asking questions, kind of dodging around the bush, not being too direct so as to come off as judging, but they always end in fights, and I find I don’t end up learning any more about why she feels that way or anything. I’m still attracted to her, and sometimes when I see her dressed up looking really gorgeous I get really sick feeling, and have to go masturbate in secret when she leaves. Doing so usually makes me feel worse about myself and I feel disloyal for doing it. I guess I don’t really know what to do. Any advice? Thank you in advance


tl;dr Despite being married 3 years we’ve never had sexual intercourse and I don’t know how to talk to her about it, as I’m kind of scared of her"
47,"My (21F) boyfriend (25M) always tells me to reach out to a now famous girl I knew in high school


So I went to high school with a girl who has become a very big singer in the US in the last couple years, I was briefly friends with her in high school before she dropped out to start singing but it was never a legit friendship where we still talk, at all, ever. 

My boyfriend is a fan of her music and every single time he mentions her, it never fails, he tells me I should message her, reach out to her, get back in contact with her because she’s famous and why wouldn’t I? I always shut him down because i don’t know, I’m not interested and I’m also not an asshole who rekindles friendships over fame? He just mentioned her new music video asking if I’d seen it and I said no, I don’t keep up with her and he replies “well you should start to or we’ll never get on the inside” and I said I don’t care and he responded “guess you don’t care about what I want”. Not only is he entirely unrealistic with this situation, he’s also super childish about it and I’m beginning to get very irritated over this shit. I don’t want to be her friend, I don’t care at all about anything she does or doesn’t do and when I say no to him he always makes a comment like “wow... kind of rude you don’t want to be her friend” etc. Things that just make no sense and are only meant to make me look like I’m doing something wrong. How do I get him to shut up?

TLDR: I went to high school and was briefly friends with a now famous singer who my boyfriend is a fan of and he constantly tells me to get back in touch with her so we can benefit by going to shows, etc. and when I tell him no he gives stupid, unrealistic and manipulative responses such as me not caring about what he wants, etc."
48,"I (27F) feel totally stuck in my life. I don’t know how to catch up with everyone else but I’m tired of being so lonely.


The title says it all. It recently hit me that my life is kind of falling apart. My friends are all getting married or having kids or moving across the country for work. I’m still friendly with all of them, but we’re drifting apart and I’m floundering. I keep trying to hang onto what we had in the past and it’s not working. I don’t have any concrete plans for my future. I have vague goals about places I’d like to go, things I would like to do, but it’s just talk at this point. Sometimes my loneliness is completely overpowering and I wallow around in self-pity for a few days. Then I feel guilty because my life is relatively easy and I don’t have anything to feel this sad about. 

A little background: 

* I have a decent job. It’s not my dream job but I’m not unhappy here, and I enjoy the perks enough to stay. 

* I currently live with my parents. A few years ago I was in the middle of moving out when my sibling died very suddenly. My other siblings scattered afterwards and I stayed put because I didn’t want to leave my parents all alone. Since then I’ve just gotten comfortable. 

* I’ve never been on a date or even seriously flirted with anyone. I have a ridiculous sex drive but I’m so scared of dating and putting myself out there that I would rather just masturbate and go on. I don’t know why anyone would be attracted to me and on the very, very rare occasion that a man shows interest I always shut it down. I’ve been asked out exactly twice and the first time was just the guy trying to get out of a date with another girl. 

* I want physical contact so much. The last time I got my hair cut I almost cried because it felt so good to be touched by another person. I’m also very reserved and don’t initiate hugs with friends or even much contact with my family. People give me a wide berth because of this. 

* I used to have a pretty big friend group. Gradually everyone had drifted apart. It seems like now when I talk to my married friends or friends who have kids, the conversation stalls and none of us know what to say. I’m still back here and it feels like they’re twenty steps ahead. 

I want to move ahead. I want to be an adult and make a life for myself, but I don’t know how. My parents seem just as bewildered as I am. They’re both go getters who dated and moved around and took risks at my age. 

Moving to my own place is something that I want very much, but I’m also afraid that if I do that I’ll be even more lonely. Instead of going home after work and chatting with my parents over dinner, I’ll go home to an empty house. What’s the point? 

Anyone else out there struggling with this? Any advice? 

TL;DR I feel like I should be a full fledged adult by now doing adult things like dating and having sex and buying a house. Instead I’m doing basically nothing and I don’t know how to get out of this rut."
49,"Today, I [23M] told my mom about my girlfriend [22F]. She doesn't like how she looks. I need help please!


This breaks my heart, literally it does. And I hate to believe that something like this is coming from my mom whom I used to love and respect so much. I think some of my respect just burnt to ashes after her comment.

I told her everything about how we met and that we have been in a relationship. I literally didn't fall in love with my girlfriend for how she looks. It's the connection we have.

I was really excited to tell my mom about her and to my surprise, after she looked at her pictures, she said, ""She isn't fair skinned and she isn't much good looking. She's got pimples all over her face.""

My heart simply was struck by an arrow. I never imagine something like this could ever come from my mother. 

When I told my girlfriend about my confession to my mom, she was so happy you guys should have seen her. I believe in the relationship we have. I tried telling my mom, ""Stop being absurd. She's good at heart and is smarter than most women these days. Why does her dark skin and how she looks should matter?""

According to her she isn't cute enough for me and that according to her I am way more good looking.

I even told my mom how my girlfriend has had childhood trauma and shame about her complexion. But my mom keeps saying that over and over again looking at her Facebook profile.

I told my girlfriend that my mom was stalking her on Facebook and she thought my mom likes her. I fucking feel like crying. I don't want to hurt her innocence.

Help me please. I don't know what to do. Certainly breaking up is just not an option and we have promised each other that we'd be there for each other no matter what. There's no way I can think of letting her go.

In India, we stay here with out parents for as long as we can, and certainly we stay with our parents before we get a job. I'm jobless and I just graduated yesterday. I still don't earn money yet.

What should I do?

Tl;dr - My mom doesn't like how my girlfriend looks and I don't know how to make her understand or handle the situation."
50,"(M 28) I'm a former gang member and I've been to prison before - I'm afraid to tell my girlfriend (F 25)


I was locked up when I was 18 on drug charges. Did four years. That wasn't my first run in with the law. Got in all kinds of trouble with coppers when I was a lad growing up. Did a few months in juvenile for getting caught with a knife when I was 14 as well. 

Like father like son in a sense cause my dad was always in and out as well. My mum died of HIV when I was 11. She was a prostitute. My dad weren't around so got took in by the state and my life just spiralled. Always bunked off school, joined a gang, fought with rival gang lads, did drugs, sold drugs. Saw a good mate of mine get stabbed to death when I was 16. Still have PTSD from that today. I can't lie, sometimes I just break down crying when I remember it. 

Going to prison was actually the best thing that could have happened to me. I think if I didn't I would have been dead by 21. Got my act together inside and did my GCSEs and A Levels. When I got out of jail I was able to go to uni cause of my studies inside and I did. Got my degree and haven't looked back in life. Left all the old gangmates and that life behind. Though I do still go back to the estate cause I have started working with youth intervention groups in my free time.

Met my girl through a friend at work. She is amazing oh my God. Like we have only been together just over a month and I'm already head over heels. She's just wonderful. We have started sharing more things about each other and my past has been weighing on my mind. I mean my girl already knows my childhood wasn't easy but she don't know the details. And I feel like if we are to progress as a couple then I gotta tell her. Don't want no skeletons in the closet ya know.

But thing is I'm just terrified she will reject me cause of it. I mean I'm already on thin ice regards to this cause she comes from a proper nice and posh background and I'm a bloke from a fucking impoverished hood in South East London (I still ask myself what she sees in me). I met her sister before and she took the piss outta my accent. Like it was all in good fun but it did make me feel self-conscious. I ain't met her parents and just the thought of it makes me weak in the knees cause surely they will think I'm not good enough for their daughter. I've also been on nights out with some of the posh mates she went to uni with and fucking hell, those kinds of people make me sweat more than I did when the judge read out my sentence.

**tl;dr**

I honestly fear the worst regarding telling her. I think I'm fucked. I think she will look at me as a criminal and will end it there and then. And the thought of that kills me. Really does cause I really like her. A colleague told me I shouldn't tell her, that what happened is in the past and she doesn't need to know. But I feel like she does and I'm resigned to telling her. How do I go about it though? And was my colleague right about ""keeping it in the past?"""
51,"My [25f] boyfriend [27m] kicks me out of his apartment when he’s upset


My boyfriend and I have been together 3 years. Everything is great. We have the same interests, laugh a lot, have a lot of chemistry, and all of it has stayed consistently great throughout the years we’ve been together. 

The only thing is that when he gets upset, his go-to reaction is to tell me to leave. It can sometimes be something so small that it doesn’t add up to me. For example, we could have a disagreement about dinner plans, he will just tell me to leave instead of going to dinner with me at all. I have to admit that sometimes I get upset, and say “no I’m not leaving over something so silly.” This has evolved into him consistently telling me before we hang out (every single time we have plans) “if I ask you to leave today, you need to leave.”  He will even tell me to leave when I have been drinking. When I tell him I can’t drive, he will tell me to get an Uber, and proceed to lock the door behind me. It makes me feel unwanted, disposable, and disrespected.

I have expressed my concerns to him, and he doesn’t seem to think it’s an issue because it’s “his apartment.” It also bothers me because I feel like I am so scared to disagree with him in any way at all, because it will result in me having to leave. Therefore, I feel like I have been stripped of my voice in the relationship.

I love him dearly, and want to spend my life with him. Breaking up is not an option I’m considering right now. When we are getting along, it’s seriously perfect! Does anyone have advice on how I can get him to stop kicking me out all the time? It would be much appreciated! 

TLDR; my boyfriend’s go-to reaction when we are arguing is to ask me to leave his apartment. I want to find a way to stop this behavior."
52,"I (31F) saw my married friend (32M) on a date with another woman (?). I'm also friends with his wife (25F). Should I say something?


Hello!

Title says it all. Basically I was out with a group of friends from work and saw my married friend with another woman in a very intimate scenario.

He has cheated on his wife when they were dating, more than 5 years ago. They are newly married (less than 1 year), I was one of the bridesmaids. I'm also friends with his wife, even more friends with her. But I only met her because of my friend when they started to date.

Now I don't know if I should tell the wife. He saw me after a while (I couldn't not stare and he ended up noticing) he sent me a texto later asking me not to tell her that the wife doesn't have to know and that he loves his wife but can't be faithful because he loves to be with different women so as long as the wife doesn't know she won't suffer since she loves him so much and would probably end up forgiving.

I am really confused. 

What should I do?

**TL;DR** : Should I tell my friends wife that I saw him cheating on her? They are married less than 1 year."
53,"Me[30M] with my Wife[31F] of 5 years and a child, we can never agree on how often or long I get out with friends. One night every week or two is all I ask, this isn't too much right?


TLDR at the bottom 

Backstory: Wife and I have a daughter of 2. Ever since she was born my wife and I have had problems. Wife suffered from postpartum depression, did see someone for a little bit, but stopped (time and money; had I known the seriousness I would have encouraged her to keep going). She was also harassed by her boss for trying to pump. She went to HR but there was only so much they would do so she ended up quitting almost a year after instead of risking termination and not being able to be hired again

I (felt I) was patient, 8 months after baby was born I tried to sit down and talk with her about us, well that lead to a huge fight.  It was lack of sex (or any sort of romance), her spending, and me not being able to see friends.  About 9 months after this fight, and a few months after she quit (nothing had improved), I gave her an ultimatum, things needed to change or I was ready for a divorce, I was half sure she'd say lets end it, but she fought and convinced me things would change.   Since then, a little over a year now things have been improving

Those first two issues are better.  She's read and listened to a lot of self help stuff and it's helped her a lot, she's happier in general.  There is still room for improvement, but I'm happy with our progress and I am again happy to spend time her

Our biggest problem, and I feel it must be a symptom of something else, is me getting out of the house with friends once in a while.  Ideally it would be once a week, but I can settle for every other week, and it is kind of what we did in the fall and it kind of worked. I say if her or our child is sick, or having meltdown, ask and I'll stay (if it's obvious I can figure it out), and I'm okay with that, though there are a few times I feel she's just been tired and just didn't want to deal with our kid.  I do my best to not hold resentment or throw it back at her later, but there is no urgency for her to ""make it up"" to me and make sure I get to go next time so when there is a time it looks like I can go, I get adamant that I get out that week and I do try to defend my position on it, but it ends up me talking about what I do to help out and how little I have been able to go, which often leads to a fight.

Before I go on too much, it's important to know our rolls.  I work in education, I get a couple months off in summer, plus breaks.  My wife is part time and started online masters in January.  We discussed at beginning of her schooling that it would be harder for me to go out during the week, and I understand that.  So a lot of time she isn't able to do much school work until the weekend or the evening after I get home.  At home I feel I do my fair share, I cook dinner every night, I pick up the kitchen, I now put the kid to sleep every night (bathe, read and sometimes play with until tired), I handle breakfast and lunches for our kid on the weekends and my breaks, I try to help pick up around the house in the evening (A lot of this I did before ). I've started taking our kid to swim and music so wife can get more her time.  In summer I often look after our kid during the day so my wife can do work and relax and I like doing it, it is fun, I get an enjoyment I could never imagined in the past, but it does wear you out. I crave adult time.  We have had a few dates this summer and need to do more, but I am also someone who needs time with friends.

My wife is a homebody, I'm not (so when I tell her to go out with friends, she declines).  This was never really a problem until our kid was here.  What I feel like I'm asking for is not too crazy.  Our friends go Mondays to the pub for trivia.  It runs from  7-9, I usually stayed until around a little after 9, when we all turned in tabs and home by about 930.  Some friends would stick around or go to another bar, but I don't do that anymore. Would I like to sometimes?  Sure, but I'm trying to meet my wife half way here

My wife has wanted to put a hard cap on this, she mentioned leave at 8:30 after the last time I went, which I thought was only if she worked the next day because last time she worked the day after. I did get home probably 15 minutes later than I said I would; we were at the last question and then there was a wreck that doubled my lateness.  So I'm not perfect on it, but I get so few opportunities to go, and it feels wrong to have a ""curfew"".  Most of these friends dont have kids, three others do, one a couple that their toddler has a late bedtime anyway and another who has 4 kids (two less than a year and two about 4), he makes it most times and even stays out another hour with the kidless friends.

Last Monday I was excited to go, it was planned, wife didn't work the next day, but she brought up the whole me leaving at 8:30 and it caught me off guard because I (stupidly) assumed that our previous conversation about a hard cutoff was if she worked the next day, well it wasn't and that led to a massive fight.  A couple months ago we talked about how we'll handle the upcoming school year and she told me that weekends work better and I'd need to try and set up things on the weekend, but if it can't work in the summer, how the hell is it going to work during the school year?

There are some other factors, my wife has a sleep disorder, requiring closer to 9 hrs of sleep (which she doesn't always stick to, hell last night she went to bed at 9:50 when she knew she had to get up at 5), she does have a hard time falling back asleep after being woken up so it's hard for me to not wake her or the baby because of her yappy dog, or I have to text her to wake her up or she stays up to let the dog out so I can come in without it barking.  I've offered to sneak in and sleep on the couch, or do all my night time stuff in the guest bathroom and then slip in bedroom, not good enough.  She says she can't sleep well till she knows I'm home so it's gonna cause her to sleep poorly.

I feel it's ridiculous and she doesn't want to budge either. We've been fighting about this for two years off and on and I'm tired of it.   We do go to bigger group events on the weekend when they happen, but those are maybe 6 or 7 times a year, and toddler is in tow and while it's fun to bring her, I'm still in dad mode when she's there

I told my wife that if our genders were reversed, her friends would say I was controlling and manipulative, she was really hurt by this, and I understand why, but it is how I feel sometimes.  I don't feel my needs are a priority, nor does she on some things, so we're in this spiral of one will try but the other doesn't feel like it, then the first person stops, roles will flip and it's the same thing all over again.  She told me she was really worried about us and feels like we had a lot of problems still, that she doesn't feel any connection with me, I mean I knew it wasn't perfect in the past, but I felt things were getting better and I thought we were both happy.  And some of it is I dont feel like I can connect fully with her again while I feel like she's my mom or boss part of the time.

During the fight she also told me that it could be some subconscious ptsd from an ex she dated for way too long, he was a druggy, stayed out as late as he wanted with no window of when he'd be home and it wasn't uncommon to get late night calls, 2 am that they needed a ride home, or were in jail.  She's come home to him ODed before and was always expecting one day to get a call that he had ODed and was dead.  I can't comment on how this affects someone as I've not lived in her shoes, but I have shown no history of anything close to this.

I agree that her and I still have a few things we can work on, but it's hard for either of us as we feel dug in on this one issue.  It makes me feel unrespected and that my needs aren't important.  How am I supposed to want to grow close to my wife like this?  I've grabbed a couple books from the library on relationships and I'm gonna check those out.  I suggested counseling, which I think we could really use if we can't figure out this issue or what is causing it.  She was not as dismissive about it as she was in the past, though finding funds and time would be tricky, but I think we could make it work.  After all the progress we've made I would feel disappointed if this issue is what breaks everything

**TLDR** My wife and I fight over how often and for how long I can go out with friends.  She has had personal issues, and shes worked on them, so I cant comment how they affect(ed) her, but after awhile it starts to take a toll on me.  I help out with the child and at home a lot and am looking for 1 evening out every week or two and get home by around 930.  We've had other problems, we have fixed or improved those, but this one problem still lingers.  I don't want this or feel like this should be the thing that makes or breaks us, but it's holding back some progress and causes building resentment in myself because I feel my needs never take a priority despite me feeling like I do a lot for her.  What I'm asking for isn't too much or ridiculous, right?"
54,"Don't know how to tell friend to not visit and stay over at our house so often


My wife (f28) and I (m28) have a friend (f28) whom we've known for a long time. She moved to a different city awhile back, but will drive back here whenever she needs a haircut, dentist, etc... She will usually schedule these on a thursday or Friday then spend the weekend at our house before going home Sunday afternoon. It used to be only every once and awhile and we said she was welcome anytime, but is now every two weeks or more and for the foreseeable future she seems to have a reason to come to town like that and wants to spend the weekend at our place.
 Usually this was never a problem and it was nice to have her over, but she has a very blah attitude about life which kind of gets to you after awhile.

 We don't really know why she always wants to spend the whole weekend with us everytime when could easily drive back home for the weekend. She never gets up before noon at the absolute earliest. Other than occasionally visiting her family she stays in the guest room until we are home from work, which is usually late as we both have demanding work schedules, watch a movie, all the while texting her new boyfriend, then back to bed and repeat. If we have the day off we will hang out, but that's not everytime. I know she doesn't get along with her parents very well so she won't stay there anymore, has never given any reason why she doesn't stay with siblings, her boyfriend works on the road and lives quite far away. 

It sounds like a ridiculous problem to have, but how do we get her to not come so often and not stay the whole weekend when we know we will barely have time to actually spend with her? We plan to be gone this weekend and she knows that but still is asking if she can stay at the house. 

Neither of us can think of a way to talk to her about this without sounding like assholes (again it sounds ridiculous given that this our own house we are talking about) she has some depression issues and can be a bit sensitive, and don't want to wreck our friendship. 

Tldr 
Want to know how to tell friend who visits and spends the weekend to not do that so much"
55,"Getting over my husband's weed habit


Hey reddit, I (25 F) recently found out that my husband (37 M) has been lying to me about some of his habits that I told him were dealbreakers for me when we were dating.

A little backstory, my husband and I have been married for almost a year now and we are about to have our first baby after much struggle with fertility. When we were dating, I found out about six months in that he was a heavy pot user and drank excessively. At this point, we weren't super committed, just having fun with each other, so I sat him down and told him that while I did like him, the pot and alcohol were dealbreakers for me and that we should go our separate ways because I didn't think it would work out. I said that because I have my own trauma with weed and users, and I've come to learn that it isn't something I can deal with/ learn to accept in my partner. I suggested we break up as it wouldn't turn out to be a good match. He then teared up and told me he loved me and would do anything to keep me around, saying that he would quit the pot and only drink moderately. I was very hesitant but he eventually convinced me he only smoked for fun and there was no dependancy issue, therefore making it a very simple and easy thing for him to let go of. Needless to say, I stayed with him. We were living in different parts of town which were pretty far away and working full time so there was no way we met up often enough or for enough time that I was able to ensure that he did/didn't give up the pot. Anyways, things go well aside with us aside from the fact that my family did not want me dating him (he comes from a different financial background than me. Not that it mattered to me) and opposed us vehemently. A year passed and he proposes to me. I accept and my family cuts me off. We get married after another year and now start living together. I notice bits and pieces of weed and weed stuff around the house but he claims they're from years ago. I find packets of shatter and glass pipe in our bedroom. I ask him politely if he still uses and he declines every time, making me feel bad for asking, saying how could I accuse him of such a thing. Me, being the idiot that I am, I trust him. Then yesterday, he sends me a text message by accident of his weed order which was supposed to go to his dealer.
I sat him down and confronted him. I didn't want to believe it at all and he kept denying until I showed him the message. He finally fesses up to everything and reveals he has kept up with his habit. I feel awful that he could lie to me like that, right to my face without batting an eye. I asked why he has put me in this situation when I am now pregnant, cut off from my family, and having to deal with his lies. He then proceeds to tell me it's my fault. That the stress surrounding my family's disapproval of him, of finding a place together, and just the general stress of adjusting to live together made it the only way he could relieve himself. To a certain extent, I could understand needing a stress reliever. But these past few months have not been easy for me either. I have been dealing with everything he has plus the pregnancy. He said everything was my fault and he couldn't be blamed for lying to me. I felt like I did my due diligence by telling him it was a dealbreaker all throughout the time we were dating. The weed and the lies repulse me to no end and I want to leave him but the baby and the prospect of having no family support is stopping me. I love him still, but my past with weed and users has been far too traumatic (he knows all the gory details) for me to deal with all this again. What should I do? Pick up the courage to leave, or will something fix this for the both of us?

Tl;dr my husband has been lying to me about his weed habit, even though I told him it was a dealbreaker early on and asked to break up. He still uses and I don't know if I should leave him."
56,"I [18F] lost my virginity to a good friend and now my Mom thinks I’m a total slut.


So, this should be fun. Well, my mom [49F] and I [18F] have always had a super close relationship. It’s just her and I in the house and I have always had no reason to hide stuff from her. I’m her only daughter, and she hasn’t remarried since my parents divorced when I was a baby, so we’re naturally very close. 

Well, as I’m finishing up my senior year of high school, I was always curious about sex and just wanted to experience the fun that everyone else raves about. I went all throughout high school only going as far as making out with a few guys. I genuinely wanted to just have fun and experience these things with someone I trusted before I started university in the fall. 

So, I began talking to my long time guy friend from school [18M] about wanting to hang with him at his house one day. He’s expressed interest in me before, but, I’m not really interested in the idea of starting a relationship right before my first year of college. He totally understood, and was down to just have some fun together and keep it super casual. Great, I think. 

So I tell my Mom I’m going to hang out with this guy, and that’s he’s my good friend. She hasn’t met him, but he’s genuinely a really nice person to hangout with. She doesn’t think much of it. I know something may happen, but I honestly don’t know for 100%, so I keep my thoughts to myself since I don’t know what’s going to happen anyways.

Alright! So, while I’m at his house, and we’re getting very flirty, just having fun. We’re fooling around, going down on eachother, making out, it’s so much fun! He was not pressuring me whatsoever (he had a lot more experience than me anyways). He was totally fine to not go any further, however, I asked him if he was willing to try and have sex. He made sure I was certain it was okay, and he agreed. I’m already on birth control and he used condoms, I wanted to make sure it was responsible. We only ended up having PIV sex for a few minutes, as I was experiencing pains. He totally understood, stopped, and we went back to fooling around like before. Perfect day, and I totally appreciated his patience. 

Well, fast forward to when I come home. My mom was home from work and I sit down around her, make small talk, the usual. Well, I’ve always been open to her about these things, and I wanted to establish open communication and made sure she knew I was honest. I tell her that my friend and I fooled around a bit, and we tried to have sex.

She’s taken off guard. Completely and utterly confused. “But you don’t even like the guy?” “You’re not dating him, how can you sleep with someone you’re not even crushing on?” “Its your FIRST TIME! I would’ve thought you would want it with a boyfriend!” 

This is what made me confused. I understand it’s an instinct for my mom to get protective, but at the same time, I told her I felt ready and I wanted to have sex with someone I trusted and felt comfortable with. I don’t regret a single second of my time with my friend. It was more than I could’ve asked for. I don’t think a label really changes anything, it’s more of how I felt with the guy at the time. 

Now, my mom thinks that “if I can sleep with this guy, you’re just going to become a slut in university.” No, Mom. Is it wrong for me to just wanted to have experienced sex after waiting all throughout high school? It’s not like I just gave it away to a random on the street, I trusted my friend and he supported me all throughout. I just think she’s being extremely hypocritical. She lost her virginity younger than I did, and even though I’m an adult, it’s unacceptable and she can’t understand why I would do it? Now I’m the slut for losing it to my friend? 

I just don’t think it’s her decision to understand. I made a decision, I was responsible and used protection, and I’m the one who is going to live with the outcome. I don’t regret my decisions, if anything I’m proud to have had my first time be with someone who was so understanding. I’m just beyond frustrated and confused. I need an outsiders point of view. Thank you all for listening to my rant. 

TLDR: I lost my virginity to my more experienced friend. Mom thinks I’m a slut and will continue to be so going into University."
57,"My [17F] best friend’s [18F,19F] slept with my brother [20M] during a sleepover, I don’t know if I should cut them off or what.


I am pretty conflicted right now. I have known both of my best friend’s since 7th grade and we all just graduated together. I’m so pissed and hurt about what happened and I never thought that they would backstab me like this. So, we usually have sleepovers at my place since I am the only one with a pool, and we hang out like this almost every weekend (fridays and saturdays). 

I knew that they found my brother attractive (everyone does) because they had told me before, but I did not expect them to mess around and actually pursue him. We usually all sleep in my room on the floor during the sleepovers , and my brother does talk with us or hang our with us sometimes but I kick hik out because I know he is just trying to get at my friends. 

This barely happened. I had woken up at night to use the restroom, and I noticed that not only one, but BOTH pf my friends were not sleeping and I kind of looked around the house for them. I checked my brother’s room and they were in there having sex with him. I don’t think I need to say much more, but I got pissed and we all got into a big argument. 

My friends have tried apologizing and talking with me, but I am having a hard time looking at them because of what they did. I’m also really conflicted because I have known them for years and we are all soo close. What should I do? Should I give them some time before I even try to cut them off or something?

TL;DR My 2 best friends snuck around during a sleepover and had turns with my brother in bed, I’m hurt and don’t know how to move forward."
58,"I (24M) broke up with my gf (25F) after she hit me in the face during an argument. I know I did the right thing, but I need help getting over her.


We've been together for a little more than 1,5 years.

She did not slap me, she punched me in the face and I pushed her away. We had been out drinking and were both drunk. We ended up in a small argument which heated up pretty quickly into unnecessary accusations. She got very upset and ot all ended up with her suddenly throwing a punch right at my lower jaw.

The reason I'm making this is because I don't know how to cope with the fact that the person that is supposed to love me decided to actually hit me so suddenly. I'm so confused and sad.  

Tldr: gf (25F) decided to hit me (24M) during an argument. I broke up. I don't know how to cope with it."
59,"How do I (19F) get it across to my boyfriend (21M) that he needs to help clean the house?


For some context: When we were living in our apartment, and for the first two months living in this house, I was unemployed. So, I was the one who did the dishes in the sink, cleaned the floors, took our the trash and what not while he was at his job. Recently, because he was getting angry about struggling with money, I got a job too. I now have considerably less time to clean the house, so it does get a bit messy.

Today, my boyfriend woke up and wouldn't speak to me. He glared at me, then went straight to the bathroom and locked the door. I waited for him to come out of his shower, but he brushed past me and went to his computer. I went in the kiss his cheek, and he said no. He then said that he is pissed off at me because our house looks bad, and he thinks he saw a roach in the kitchen. He then launched a game and told me to clean. 

I understand that I've been a bit slack lately on cleaning, as my job has me on my feet a lot and I'm still not used to it. But, he doesn't raise a finger to help me. In the entire time we've been together he has washed maybe two dishes, and cleaned out the bath tub before he wants a bath. He seems to think that all of the cleaning falls on me, and gets angry and will not talk to me if the house isn't perfect. All he does on his weekends is sleep and play MMOs, essentially. I desperately need his help on cleaning, but he doesn't seem to think its his responsibility. This has already caused days of him ignoring me, and shouting matches. How do I make him understand that it's hard for me to keep up my job and keep the house perfect without his help?

TL;DR: Got a job, struggling to keep the house as clean as before. Boyfriend gets angry at the mess, but refuses to help. How do I get him to help me out?"
60,"My [26M] coworkers have started treating me differently for seemingly no reason. I may quit.


I work at a fast casual restaurant chain you've heard of. I've been there about 3 months now, and at first it was good. I can be awkward, but I was making friends and getting better at the job. I felt like part of the team, and it felt like a job I could do till I figured some stuff out. A few weeks ago, it all changed.

 It was clear a rumor spread about me. One manager avoids me. Another literally won't talk to me, sends someone else if she needs to tell me something. People whisper about me. People who I was sort of becoming friends with (work friends anyway) no longer like me. When I asked people (including managers) about it to figure out what was going on they pretend they have no clue, or give me a look like ""you should f***ing know."" I'm cool with new hires at first, till they hear whatever the rumor is and then they act the same way as everyone else. I also have social anxiety that used to be really, really bad, and this is making it bad again (my roommate who I've known forever even said I remind him of the way I was in early college, a very bad sign). 

The job pays pretty well (blows most fast food places out of the water, its actually a living wage) and I actually kinda like customer service (don't ask, idk why either), so I don't want to quit over ""my feelings"" but I know myself and I'm not going to survive in an environment like that where I'm literally an outcast. I have a second job freelancing in my field that makes me some money, its just not consistent enough, but its something to sort of fall back on till I find a new thing.

But I'm tired of finding new things. My life was a bit unstable before this, and I finally felt like I'd found a job I enjoyed, that payed well, that I could do while I built a real career in my field in my free time. I just want to find a solution besides quitting.

Tl;dr Coworkers at a job I like ostracized me over some rumor no one will tell me. Its getting so bad and affecting me so much I may quit"
61,"I(26f) just had a baby with my bf(26m) of a year and a half. I think I want to leave.


Throwaway for obvious reasons.

I'm gonna say I know my choices haven't been the best and I made a mess. I'm not excusing my actions.

About a year and half ago I was coming out of a divorce. It was messy. Me and my ex had been together for 7 years when he asked for a divorce. 

About 5 months later, I met Jake(26m). I understand rebounding and heard all the warnings. But he was a breath of fresh air after everything. My ex was hateful and mean during it and pointed out every insecurity I had felt about myself when he ended things. The girl he was talking to behind my back messaged me a lot of things comparing us and him claiming he loved her the entire time we were together. 

I guess my whole point is I felt like trash and was desperate to feel loved or worth something to somebody.

But everything was going great. He was amazing. I had car troubles in the middle of the night and he drove an hour to help me. Always was offering to buy things for me because he knew the divorce had destroyed my finances. He was attentive and always caring. 

7 months after being together, I ended up pregnant.  I fully understand why I was an idiot. I was careless one night and that's it. And honestly after trying for a child over a year with my ex husband, I thought there was a possibility I couldn't get pregnant. Regardless we talk about it and we decide to keep him. I moved in with him shortly after.

He was born 3 weeks ago after a really hard pregnancy and I had to be induced 6 weeks early. I love him and everything is amazing with him.

It seems as soon as I moved in with him, something snapped. He literally picked a fight with me a day after we moved in together and I had to apologize 5000 times.

I'm just gonna list examples of things he's said and done:
-Told me I was gonna be an awful mother. I don't remember what that was over, but he said shit like that all the time if I did anything he didn't like.

- told me I was damaged goods and nobody would want me if we broke up because no man wants a single mom. Later said he was joking.

- one night he was tickling me and I was asking him to stop. I HATE being tickled. He kept doing it and I accidentally hit him in the face. I was heavily pregnant at this point and barely could breath and was trying to push me him off me. He accused me of being abusive. 

- if I say anything he doesn't like, he going into where he can cut me hard at. Disagreement about who needs to be cleaning the kitchen? I just like his crazy ex and more insults about what kind of mom I'm gonna be.

- jokes constantly about fucking my friends and sisters to make me jealous. 

- another thing, he jokes constantly but some of the things he says just aren't funny and more offensive than anything. 4 family members have spoken up and said he's constantly degrading me. But again he's just ""joking"". 

- yells as me if he has to repeat himself or I don't understand something quick enough. We took a CPR class before we could bring our son home and I was in tears at the end of it because I was getting yelled at each time I didn't do something right.. like I just rewinded a certain part to watch again and he lost it with me. I know the nurses heard because they were very stand offish with him and being extra friendly with me.

- I'm the one with our son the majority of the time. I'm on maternity leave. Yet feels the need to correct me over everything and seems to think  I know nothing. I'm doing everything the exact way the nurses taught me. Burping, holding him, bathing him, changing his diaper etc everything. Again I get yelled at.

- I need to go pick my car up so I have a car during the day while he's gone to go to the store or if something happens. ""Why do you need a car? You have the baby and need to stay home"".

-refused to help me around the house. I was working 60 hours at the end of my pregnancy, still wouldn't do anything to help me.

- I end up being admitted to the hospital because I had very high blood pressure and they were going to take the baby early. He still was picking fights with me. I got yelled at for asking him to go get me water and made me call a nurse to. 

- I can't blame him for me developing preclamspia,  but I don't think he made it easier or helped take any stress off me. He was picking fights with me, yelling, accusing me of being ""weak"" even as my doctors told him ""she's getting really sick"", refused to help me around the house. He made the stress 10x worse. Even when he joking he just doesn't know how to stop, even when I'm telling him to. 

-makes jokes about me taking the easy way out of labor or not being a real woman because after 10 hours of it I had to have an emergency csection. Ya know, because my blood pressure shot to 240/120 after my epidural. This is particularly hurtful for me because yes, I do feel like my body failed me. My epidural ended up sliding out and had to be put under so I didn't even get to see my son until 10 hours later.

- finally, jealousy is coming out. Almost immediately after I had the baby. A man talks to me, it turns into an argument. He's currently jealous over my ex husband that I've had 3 email exchanges with in the last 6 month over some financial loose ends. He's threatened to message him and I've had to beg him not to. I don't want my ex back nor would I ever or have cheated. There's nothing emotional in those emails and he read them. He sends threatening messages to any man he thinks is flirting with me.

A lot of other things hes done that hurt me, but I'm trying to avoid turning this into a novel.

Family members are worried. My mom was in a physically abusive relationship a few years ago and says she sees the same characteristics in him that she did her ex. 

I can leave and I fortunately have options and now make enough money that I can support both me and my son without child support, even if things are tight. But he does absolutely love his son. I don't have a problem with him in how he cares for his son, because he does help out with him a great deal. And he can be kind to me and does try to help me in other ways. 

I don't know if he will change or things will get better. I don't know if all this might be the stress of an unplanned pregnancy and a baby. But I don't want my son growing up thinking it's normal to talk to or treat anyone this way. Or having to endure the fights. But I wanted a family and I know his dad loves him. I want things to get better but I tired of feeling like a worthless idiot. I just need advice if this is even salvageable at this point or if it's worth trying to fix things. Today he snapped at me again after us talking last night that he needs to control his temper, and I'm just not sure if he's capable of communicating with me.

I'm sorry this got so long. 

Tl;dr Just had a baby. Boyfriend has temper and it's gotten increasingly worse. Not sure if it's worth sticking out for"
62,"My [28F] married coworker [33M] out of the blue asked if I wanted to call off my wedding to be with him


(Throwaway for privacy. I'm surprised this username was free.)

&amp;#x200B;

When I joined my tiny tech company a few years ago the culture was quiet and standoffish. Being a friendly extrovert who craves social interaction, I began organizing social events to get the team talking and hanging out. The company culture has slowly become more friendly and open, and I consider many of my coworkers to be friends. I love my job, it's a uniquely amazing situation.

&amp;#x200B;

One coworker, “Matt”, recently started messaging me inside and outside of work hours. Not unusual, but his tone and emoji usage gave me some flirtatious vibes, so I stopped replying outside of work hours and made sure to constantly bring up my extremely funny and good-looking fiancé and our upcoming wedding.

&amp;#x200B;

Last week, after a team happy hour that included my fiancé, Matt, and Matt’s wife, I got a message from Matt that went like this:

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;“Can I ask you something in confidence? I have very serious feelings for you. I really tried not to, I’ve just never met anyone like you. Do you want to talk before you take your vows or are you happy where you’re at? I’m totally ready to drop it if you’re sure that’s what you want. I don’t want to put you in a bad spot. I just have to be honest”

&amp;#x200B;

I felt sick and showed my fiancé. We were both gobsmacked and a little angry. I’m friendly with everyone and I joke around a lot which I know can come off as flirty, but I had been careful to send zero confusing signals to this guy. We work together closely on a lot of projects. His desk is next to mine. I had thought we had built up a friendly rapport. He’s MARRIED and his wife is VERY COOL.

&amp;#x200B;

I ended up sending only this in response:

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;“I’m blown away that you thought this was appropriate. What does your wife think? Are you going to tell her about this? What part of me constantly talking about \[Fiancé\] and our wedding gave you anything to misread? What made you think I would keep a text like that from him? I thought we were coworkers becoming friends but obviously I also misread the situation. You need to keep it strictly professional with me from now on. If you ever bring this up again, I will have to report it.”

&amp;#x200B;

Matt spent the rest of the night apologizing and backpedaling and saying he felt very stupid and would keep it professional now. He then put in PTO for the rest of the week. He hasn’t contacted me since.

&amp;#x200B;

My fiancé thinks I should go to leadership with the texts, and I hate that I feel this way, but... I don’t want to. I know he’d probably be fired, and being a tiny tight-knit company, everyone would find out what happened, and I just don’t want to be in the middle of a dramatic shitstorm like that. I hate that my reluctance to navigate the exhausting task of holding him accountable feels like I’m defending him. I'm also thinking about his stay-at-home wife. I tried to find her contact info and failed.

&amp;#x200B;

I’ll see him for the first time at work on Monday. I’m thinking about asking him to find a reason to move desks. I plan to act breezily professional and feel it out, but I'm worried he'll say something else or the job I love will be made awkward. Where can I go from here?

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR; Married coworker asked out of the blue if I wanted to call off my wedding to be with him, I shot him down and showed my fiancé, how do I navigate work after this?"
63,"How do I [F35] navigate this major culture clash between me and DH [M35] ?


We are both Southeast Asian and were both born and raised in the US. I was raised in a very modern Westernised way with a view to integrating into the Western society, but most definitely still had some traditional values instilled in me. DH was raised in a very old school Eastern way typical of back in our parents home country.

When we dated I saw no cultural differences as we had a very modern relationship following the Western norms. Throughout wedding planning I saw how overbearing and controlling his parents were and how conflict avoidant my husband was, but thought perhaps that would subside once the wedding was over. Now that we are married, I see we have a huge culture clash and that the controlling parents and my submissive husband is the nature of their relationship. In generations before us, arranged marriages were the norm in which daughter in laws often lived with their in-laws and were treated poorly and were basically treated like maids and had to conform and obey. Their husbands did not have their wives back, they put their parents first and one of the key focuses of the marriage was to have and raise children. There was no intimacy or closeness in these marriages.

Now whilst my husband is not to this extreme and we do not live with my in-laws, my husband has definitely stood by and watched his family treat me poorly and done nothing about it. They do not have any daughters and do not know how to respect women. My husband has stood by and watched his own mother treated poorly by her MIL whilst his Dad joined in. I have chosen to keep away from the family, but my husband continues to see them 3 times a week which I find excessive but also hurtful in light of how they have treated me.

What baffles me is that he expects certain aspects of our marriage to follow the typical cultural norms of Southeast Asia, but then he wants the love and closeness and intimacy of a Western marriage. These two do not go hand in hand. If your marriage is one whereby you put your family of origin before your wife, what on earth makes him think I am going to want to be intimate with him? He is saying we should be able to take the best bits of both cultures, but what I see is him taking the bits which benefit him. So it is beneficial for him to devote 3 evenings a week to his family who have treated me poorly, but it is also beneficial for him to then expect to come home, snuggle and be close, and have a date night. I just don’t see it possible for me to give him the intimacy that derives from Western relationships when he wants to make his family such a huge priority which is typical of eastern marriages?

Tl;dr DH wants me to go along with whichever eastern and western cultural norms benefit him, but I don’t see how this will work"
64,"I [30F] found out my [30M] boyfriend of 8 months is going to break up with me in two weeks


I posted this thread a couple weeks ago because I was sensing my boyfriend was going to break-up with me.

Turns out I was right. I saw a text pop up on my boyfriend's phone this morning asking if he broke up with me yet. I am heartbroken and feel incredibly embarassed. I didn't say anything because we have tickets with his friends to go to this event in two weeks, so he's waiting to do it until then.Anyways - he could tell I was acting weird and asked what was wrong. I said I felt like he's been distant lately and he asked how? I said he hasn't been affectionate and i can sense something is off. He was super quiet and said he would do better, but deep down I know he was thinking that he is going to break up with me but can't do it yet.

I told him I feel stupid. He gave me a hug and asked why. I said I don't feel stupid for bringing this conversation up, I feel stupid for giving all of myself to you and I don't even know how you feel.

So we left for work and no kiss or anything. Just an awkward hug and I'm going away on vacation for a week so I just said have a good week.

I'm so upset. I feel like i must have done something for him to fall out of love with me. Just breaks my heart.

I don't know what to do about the tickets we have with all his friends. I bought a cute outfit and everything.

Any advice/support would be really helpful and appreciated.

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR; Found out my boyfriend is going to break up with me soon and I am heartbroken. I dont know what to do."
65,"Do I (29F) tell a man that I’ve started seeing (37M) that the sex is so bad it may be a deal breaker?


Throwaway for obvious reasons.

I met a man on tinder that I like. He’s kind, smart, funny, and treats me really well. I enjoy his company and have enjoyed getting to know him over these last few weeks. 

Recently, we had sex. The kissing and foreplay were pretty dang good. The sex was brutal. I thought maybe it was because he was nervous or whatever so I didn’t think much of it. I ended up spending the night and we tried a few more times throughout the evening. Each time was about the same. *I should note, he is smaller than average and was not able to maintain an erection. He would say he was erect but in my experience (realizing I do not have a penis) he was not hard. This was the problem.* He was able to finish twice and was nice but I had the feeling neither of us was all that amped about it. 

When I left in the morning I kind of thought that would be the end of it. I like him but sex is very important to me and I didn’t think we had much chemistry in the bedroom. I was under the impression he felt the same way.

We made some small talk for the rest of the week, he was going away on vacation so we would be communicating sparsely anyways. On the night that he was coming home he texted me that he missed me and couldn’t wait to see me. He has asked me to hangout again and keeps asking for dates I’m free. 

I actually like him as a person. I enjoy his company and we are compatible in a lot of ways. I don’t feel the crazy I want to jump your bones sex vibes but I am attracted to him. I think I could handle if the sex was okay (not great) but I don’t know if I could handle bad sex. 

My question is: do I talk to him about the terrible sex or do I end things based on this incompatibility? If I talk to him about it, how do I do it in a way that will not permanently scar him? 

All feedback is welcome!!

TL;DR! Seeing a new man but the sex was awful. Do I tell him how I feel about the sex or end things?"
66,"I [23 F] told a girl [21 F] that she was cheated on last year after the rest of my friend group [20s] have been lying to her about it. Now everyone is mad at me.


For some context, I used to be a part of a friend group a year ago, but was having a lot of personal issues that were making me go kind of crazy so I went MIA for a little over a year to work on myself. No social media, no friends, just wanted to work on myself alone. 

&amp;#x200B;

Recently, they reached out to me again and wanted me to hang out with them, I agreed and it's been nice, except dynamics have changed a bit. My main friend now has a girlfriend, and a girl that I believed to be the ex of one of the other guys now hangs out more regularly and they are ""back together."" I assumed they were ""back"" together because the entire time I hung out with them last year, he was sleeping with a different girl (one of my friends) and told me he had dumped this girl.

&amp;#x200B;

Come to find out, he never dumped her...which made a lot of things make sense. Like, why she would occasionally be in his room while he was seeing someone else and why she would post on social media as if they were still together. He explained it back then as, ""Oh, she's fucking psycho. She still thinks we're dating."" He allowed people to call her psycho in his presence and perpetuated it quite a bit to the point where a lot of people even outside the friend group called her ""psycho"" and still do to this day.

&amp;#x200B;

Apparently, she did not know that he was sleeping with someone else during this period but suspected. I brought it up to my main friend and his gal and they told me not to say anything and that the scores were settled anyway because she also cheated once upon a time. My friend also claimed to ""not remember"" any of events of last year.

&amp;#x200B;

Well, me and this girl end up hitting it off (I'm also female, not trying to slide in). She brings up the fact that I used to be friends with the girl she suspects her boyfriend cheated with. My friend's girlfriend was giving me a, ""Don't say shit,"" look, but I cracked. I couldn't keep that in and just straight up lie to her face. 

&amp;#x200B;

Obviously, she was upset but she thanked me for telling her. My friend's girlfriend was pissed at me, she immediately locked herself in her room and started texting my friend informing him of what I did and all Hell broke loose.

&amp;#x200B;

She (friend's girlfriend) also warned me that I shouldn't have said anything because all I did was start shit.

&amp;#x200B;

I also told the girl that my friend and his girlfriend were also aware of the cheating and lied to her every time she asked.

&amp;#x200B;

Pretty soon after, my friend and this girl's boyfriend were slandering me, saying that I'm ""crazy"" and trying to start shit and that I've always been ""jaded"" and how they thought that after this year-long break that I took that I was, ""Not crazy anymore, but I guess we were wrong."" That hurt, because I've been going to counseling and really put in an effort to not be ""crazy."" 

&amp;#x200B;

The boyfriend also denied the cheating, that I was witness to for 5 months.

&amp;#x200B;

I don't think what I did was wrong per se, but I do feel like I might be *in* the wrong for coming back into this friend group for no less than a month and basically wrecking it overnight with the truth.

The only reason I said anything was because this girl was starting to tell me that she was glad that we met because she thought I was ""real"" and ""cool"" and wanted to hang out more. I have previously been cheated on and everyone knew but me and I felt like an idiot, so I sympathized with her.

&amp;#x200B;

What do y'all think? I already apologized to them for causing a riff, but explained my position of being uncomfortable with lying to this girl like they've been doing for a year. 

They're no longer talking to me, though. 

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR: Got back into a friend group that I was gone from for a year, immediately found out they were lying to one friend about her boyfriend having not cheated on her during the period I was actively friends with them and decided to tell the truth. Now all except her are mad at me."
67,"[M23] Spending time with GF (or friends) feels like a chore and I want to do something about this.


Hey Reddit ! 

So I’ve noticed this pattern that I usually end my relationships because they feel like a chore even if I really like the person I’m going out with. 

I work shifts at hospital and I know this will sound weird but spending my day off with someone feels like actually “doing something” and not relaxing. When I’m alone I can tidy up my apartment, cook etc but when I spend a day with my GF (or friends too) it doesn’t feel like a day off. And I do realize the issue is within me because this is the main reason all my relationships failed. And I don’t even have a clue where to start to change this. I don’t want another relationship to fail just because this.

Anyone had experience with this? How would you start working on this, what should I do? 

Thanks a lot for any kind of answer and have a great day!

TLDR: Spending time with GF (or anyone else) feels like a chore and keeps me from developing a solid relationship."
68,"I (23m) think that my gf’s (22f) best friend (25m) is in love with her


Together for 3 years. 

6 months ago she met a guy in university and they immediately started hanging out a lot. In such a short period of time they became best friends. 

I trust my gf, but this guy seems suspicious to me. They are always teasing each other and he is telling her he hates her the most in the world and that he rarely feels that about somebody. After lectures, he walks or drives her home. He told her that his perfect girlfriend would be a smart and witty, blonde girl (exactly my gf). 

Once a colleague was a bit rude to her and her best friend was so pissed to hear that, that when he saw that person he yelled at them. 

Needless to say that he texts her a lot etc, drives her everywhere and is proud that she ‘trusts him enough to let him drive her’. 

They disagree a lot on religion and he never allows anyone to really argue his views, but she can literally insult him and he laughs. Idk

69,"My (19F) family calls my sister (14F) fat even though she is not


My family is Asian and they’re very critical of weight, especially my mother and aunts. No one in my family is close to fat, we’re all average weight and my sister is the skinny one. We’re both 5’5"" and I’m 120lb and she is 100lb. My mom sometimes calls me fat, a pig, or makes snarky comments if I’m eating junk food or getting a second helping. My aunts live in another country and when we meet up they always comment on how I’ve gotten fatter. It made me feel terrible and in high school I starved myself which then resulted in a binge eating disorder. When my dad noticed I wasn’t eating a lot he talked to me about how dangerous anorexia was, to which my mom said that being fat was worse. It was a horrible two years and it messed up my relationship with food, but now I am better.


Recently these past few months they’re starting to call my sister fat even though she is 100lb and totally fine. In the past they always talked about how skinny she was, but now if she eats a lot or goes clothes shopping for bigger sizes (you know, to replace clothes from her childhood) they say how she’s fat now. A picture of my sister was posted to a family chat and the first comment was my aunt saying how she looked fat, which my mom was happy to share with my sister. I don’t know how my sister feels about this because we haven’t really talked about it, mostly she just rolls her eyes at the comments and we make fun of how dumb and rude they are. I messaged one of them to stop but she just ignored me. I hate my mom and aunts for being adults who have to make comments about a healthy, growing teenager’s weight. My aunts are visiting this summer and I know they’re going to make more rude comments. I’m concerned that my sister will grow self conscious or develop some eating disorder. I don’t think my aunts will change because they are very stubborn, but my mom is nice in other aspects, how do I talk to her and get her to stop using the word fat? And should I say anything to my sister? - we’re close but she really hasn’t said much about it and I don’t want to make a big deal out of it. 

TL;DR: Family calls sister fat even though she is skinny, worried it’ll mess up her body image or something"
70,"My(23M) girlfriend(22F) makes me uncomfortable when she is drunk and I don’t know how to bring it up.


TL;DR:Girlfriend gets embarrassing when drunk and I don’t know how to bring this up to her without hurting her feelings.

Like the title says, when my girlfriend gets drunk she gets quite embarrassing in front of others.

For her it only takes about 4 drinks before she is quite drunk, when this happened she starts asking questions like “do you still love me” in like a pouty baby voice and of course I say yes, but then she will continue asking for like half an hour all while pouting more because she can tell I’m getting annoyed at these questions especially around friends. She will also typically act far too sexual towards me in front of others which makes me extremely uncomfortable because I feel like it would make everyone else uncomfortable. I admit that I probably have a stick up my ass and am a bit too conservative about these actions just due to the way I grew up, but I really feel like it goes to far because I always feel like I have to baby her in front of others when this is happening. The longer it goes the more annoyed I get which makes her keep doing it all because I guess she gets worried that I don’t love her despite the fact that I spend literally all my time with her as we live together. And we do do things like dates, cuddling, and all that great stuff but the second it stops she thinks I don’t love her. I can hardly have a night to myself anymore without her pouting when u want time to myself. I don’t think she does it on purpose though, she has high anxiety and isn’t great at hiding her emotions.

When I try to bring this up when we are sober she either gets super pouty again about it or acts like it’s just my problem that I feel this way and that it’s stupid and gets annoyed. Now I avoid drinking with her in public because of this. I don’t know if I’m being crazy about this and being too conservative, but I don’t know how to bring this up without making her sad, or if I even should. And please don’t get me wrong, she is a loving and supportive girlfriend who I really do get along with. I’m also pretty bad at communicating my feelings in the moment so I’m worried I won’t say the right things. I just feel a bit suffocated by her if that makes sense. I don’t want these feeling to keep building up before they cause a problem. Thanks for any input!!"
71,"Is my new gf (22f) showing some early red flags?


I was set up with my girlfriend two months ago by her sister, who is a close friend of mine. We began dating officially about 5 weeks ago but I’ve begun to notice some red flags but I’m not sure what to do.

The first night after she moved back out here, so really the second night I had spent time with her, she asked me if she could tell me something. I was expecting a confession of love or something but she said, “It really bugged me how close you are to your friends. . . Like if you love them so much why don’t you go join their relationships?” 

It was bizarre and I just kind of changed the subject. I had talked only a few times about how much they meant to me, and she had never spent time with me and them so I can’t imagine why she would be saying this. My friends are great people. They are friends with her family and they grew up near each other. It really bothered me. It would be like someone telling you that they were bothered that you were close to your family. I didn’t get it. 

It came up again when she snapped at me once while I’m as telling her a story about how I brought almost all of my friends to my family’s house for my birthday dinner. All my favorite people in one place, and I wanted my family to know that side of my life. She snapped, “Why would you bring your friends home?” 

I was weirded out by it. Extremely. I asked her why she had a problem with me bringing my friends home and she said that she just thinks some things should be done without friends involved. I explained how important 4 of my friends have been and how I consider them to be family. Again recounting how I am invited on their family vacations and invited to many family functions. It’s one of the only places I truly feel known and loved. She told me she just didn’t understand because her family was so close. It bothered me that this bothered her. I couldn’t think of a reason. Two weeks went by and I came up with excuse after excuse to tell my friends when they asked if I could bring her over so they could get to know her better.

She refused most of the time,and then I just stopped asking. All the while she is going off about how she wants me to fly home with her for the 4th of July to meet the rest of her family. I’m already close friends with two of her siblings and her brother in law.

Wednesday was a weird night. We have been telling each other “I love you” for about a week now. I held her as we said goodbye and I whispered “I love you.” She didn’t reciprocate and coldly asked, “Why?” I stammered out a few answers but she didn’t respond and we said goodbye. She didn’t send me a typical goodnight text, and didn’t respond to my morning text until about 3pm. She canceled on plans I had with her and some friends to go get dinner. She said she had things to do. I accepted she needed some space.

Friday she blew up at me for not telling her I had canceled dinner plans. I apologized and told her that I felt she needed a day and was confused by her bailing. She wasn’t happy with he explanation but we had planned on camping so we just hugged it out and I told her I was sorry.

Friday night we went camping. The trip was awesome. She seemed to have a lot of fun! She had her closest friends and a very close cousin there, I had a few of my closest friends that she knows pretty well and grew up with, and then there was a large group of people neither of us knew very well. We had a lot of fun and and the end of the day we went to bed and that was that. 

Saturday we spent the morning together, then a little bit at my friends house for a big BBQ. That night we watched a movie at her sisters house on a kind of double date. It was fun and at the end of the night we were parting ways and I was kissing her goodnight when she told me that we needed to talk.

For the next 3 hours I sat and listened, hardly speaking, as she angrily told me that she doesn’t like it when we are with my friends. She told me she has no interest in being friends with them and that she knew right away because you can “just tell.” 

I waited and listened until she finally asked me if I would say something. I told her that hearing this was hard for me. She has been snapping at me all week long having fights like this so early on in a relationship scares me.. and about what?? The people I have professed my most profound love for. She just told me she doesn’t like the. 

She began to back pedal and tell me that she is willing to be friends with them, but i brought up how weird it was that she said so early on that she was bothered by my friendships. 

I feel alone because this is a girl I actually am falling in love with and the people I would normally turn to for advice. . . Are effected. I can’t tell them that my gf does like them. That will throw a wrench in all of our relationships going forward. Thats a nasty fog to try and dispel later on.

I’m worried this kind of thing will manifest itself really negatively in the future and i don’t know how to deal with it. What do you guys think?

**TL;DR** My gf of 5 weeks is acting weird, picking fights, and from the very beginning told me she doesn’t like that I have close friendships. Just now she’s told me she has no interest in becoming friends with them"
72,"My (21M) girlfriend (19F) Photoshops her Instagram pictures for hours and it’s a major turnoff for me


My girlfriend fits the mold of the typical blonde sorority girl who goes out all the time and posts Snapchat stories with girls she later says she can’t stand. I’m her first ever boyfriend of a long line of thirsty boys who’d invite her over to have sex then never talk to her again unless they’re horny. 

Of course, I don’t see her that way (honestly I did when we first started, but I’ve realized there’s so much more to her that I love). I love her so much and she tells me that I’m helping her love herself and raise her standards for how people treat her. 

But she still takes around 80-100 takes of the same pic of herself to curate her Instagram (that’s not an exaggeration). She takes a bunch with me and complains that they’re “not cute”. Personally, I think every picture with me and her in it is a cute picture and I think she’s the prettiest girl in the world. 

But now she has started Photoshopping her Instagram pics and the amount she cares about her image is a major turn off to me. 

I know it’s not my job, but I want to make her feel better about it and make her stop caring so much about having a curated social media persona. It gets hard hearing when she doesn’t think pics of us are good because they’re not staged and edited, but I don’t know what to do. 

It’s such a bummer because I love her just the way she is and I hate when she feels like she has to impress random strangers she doesn’t even care about. How do I deal with it?

**TL;DR My girlfriend has self esteem issues from her past and puts a lot of her self worth into her Instagram persona. It’s a major turnoff for me and idk what to do**"
73,"My mother [40F] is kicking me out and disowning me [17M] for ""being abusive""


This happened in the span of the last two days, I need to make it as detailed as possible because this will be my record of what happened. This will in no way be a perfect account of things, as in the timeline might be different but these things did happen without a doubt.

&amp;#x200B;

This all started with a glass of juice. Two days ago I spilled some juice in the middle of the night and tried to clean it up as best as i could, I had work that morning and decided to tell her afterwards. The next morning at work she calls me completely livid and tells me I'm paying for a cleaning fee and get my car taken away for a week, fair enough for me. After work I come home and nobody's there. After a while my younger sister \[14F\] comes home with some friends that I know are my mothers friends kids and they told me everyone else was at the community pool. We spend some time together and we have a good time. 

My mother comes home and i go to greet her and apologize but she storms past me and I see her visibly upset. My step dad runs over to her and is trying to figure out what was wrong. My friends mother picks up her kids and they get out really fast. She slammed the door in our neighbors face and is raving how he doesn't have the right to tell her to slow down when she's going 25. According to my sister who was there she had a mixture of vodka and about two bottles of wine. She's blaming my step dad for ""embarrassing her in front of her friends and neighbors"" and she's yelling at him and saying he didn't have her back and betrayed her. At this point I check up on my sister and asks her if she wants to leave for a while. She says she doesn't but invites me to go water our grans garden. 

While we're doing that our step dad comes over and explains what happened and what he knows. We hear a loud thud in the garage and he sends me to go check it out. She ripped up my sisters old dollhouse and its on the floor in the middle of the garage. The garage door is open and I went to look for her. She was storming off to our neighbors and I chased after her. She knocked on his door and I came between her and the door and started pushing her away from the door telling her to go back inside. She tries to push me away but I lift her up and start carrying her. Once I'm at our property I put her down on the grass and ask her if she's going to go inside. She tries to push me away to go yell at the neighbor who is outside looking at us asking us what's going on. She keeps pushing me so I pick her up the rest of the way to the front door. My step comes and is talking to my mother saying she needs to go inside or the neighbors are gonna call the cops. I eventually lead her inside and she starts saying that I betrayed her and I didn't have her best interest in mind. I eventually break down after a few minutes of this and I yell at her in Russian (our native tongue) saying stuff like what the fuck are you doing. 

I calm down and my step dad goes to speak to the neighbors as I'm keeping her away from the door. She keeps yelling how we don't have her interest in mind and that I'm betraying her. Our step dad comes back and she puts all the blame on him. She starts yelling that she wants a divorce and she starts pushing and punching him. She tells him to get out of her house (they bought the house together) and he eventually leaves to try to diffuse the situation. As soon as she leaves she turns to me and starts yelling at me and eventually it escalates to her punching me in the gut, ribs, chest, and face as I ask her to stop hitting me. I defend myself as best as I can but I just break and I slap her across the face as hard as I can. She is in shock and says I assaulted her and starts punching as hard as she can. I push her to the ground and she starts hitting my feet. She grabs them and then grabs my shirt as I try to pull away. I break down as I plead to her to let go as my sister comes and helps take my shirt off. I get away from her and called my step and explained she was hitting me and i slapped her. She is walking pace chasing me yelling at me that I assaulted her. She comes and starts hitting me again on the back and I push her away and leave to my room. My sister is holding her in place as she's trying to calm her down. My mom is bleeding from the mouth and my sister starts crying. I talk to my step dad and he calms me down and tells me not to hit her and to keep an eye on her. 

My sister helps my mother clean up and I come back and she tells me I'm abusive and she is no longer my mother and doesn't love me, I said that she scared me and wouldn't stop hitting me. She leaves the house and gets in the car. Before the my step dad hid the keys. She realizes she can't drive and demands her keys which I tell her I don't have. She goes inside and keeps yelling at me and goes upstairs and says she is all alone and no one cares for her. I follow her because I'm scared she might do something to herself and she makes it to the bedroom where she tries to lock the door. I open the door before she has a chance to and she starts yelling at me to get out. At this point I should have left but I was genuinely scared that she was going to hurt herself. My sister comes upstairs and tells her to go lie down in bed. she refuses and tries to lock herself in the bathroom. I open the door and accidentally hit her with the door. She calls me abusive again. Before this she started prodding at me saying how I think I'm ""righteous"" and that I think that I'm all that and I know right from wrong. She then says that I am pathetic because I think i have depression and that I used to cut myself, and that she isn't going to a therapist whining about her problems to someone (recently started going to therapy and exercising to improve my mood). She keeps calling me pathetic and repeating her previous insults as well as ranting about the spilled juice and how I disrespected her. 

She then breaks down and starts saying that she wasn't abusive to us and starts yelling at us about her childhood and how she had to wipe down the house with a rag two times a week and take public transport three times a week to water plants (she grew up in soviet Kazakhstan). She calls us all spoiled and ungrateful. She then tells me to go wipe down all of downstairs I say okay and I go to the balcony and dump all the water out. She sees this and is visibly upset. She goes downstairs and demands her phone and my keys (I drive her old car). I said I didn't know where either were and she tells me to go find them (I didn't know where the keys were hidden). At some point I sit down on the couch to get a break. She keeps asking if I thought what I did was right. I said that she was being stupid when she decided to drink and drive, speed, and then try to yell at the neighbors as well as hitting her son. She than says that she never hit me and keeps yelling at me. She goes away to try to call my step dad from her ipad and I ask my sister if she wants to leave. 

She says yes and I tell her to pack. I text my friend to go to the basket ball court to meet us there and that it was an emergency. I later call him and tell him to pick us up directly from my house. I go find her phone and hand it to her. She calls my step dad who ive been in touch with and she yells at him. He hangs up and she keeps calling him. She goes upstairs and I start grabbing stuff for one night. I hear her calling for my step dads  cat. I check my phone and I see texts from my dad that she is threatening to harm his cat. I tell my sis we're taking the pets and to be ready. My mother comes downstairs and she takes my sisters and my stepfathers and goes to the garage. I follow her and see her throwing them away. I come to her and she screams at me telling me to get out of her face. She starts hitting me and I brace myself to try not to use violence against her. She starts punching me in the gut and ribs and i push her away, she falls on the ground and i take the ipads out of the garbage and leave. She runs at me and i lock the garage door. I calm down and try to let her in but she isnt there. My sister finds her in the back with a jar preparing to smash it into the glass door. I unlock the door for her and she and my sister are arguing, my mother is telling her to go wash the plants. I tell her the door is unlocked and she storms by me and goes upstairs saying I cut all bonds with her and that I am on my own for the rest of my life. 

Throughout this I have kept my other friend/ex gf updated on what has been happening, though i stopped for a while about half way through. I check on my mum and she is on her phone in her room. We decide to leave at that point. We grab our two cats and our chihuahua, we have to leave behind my grans dog because she was too big but we knew she was gonna be okay. I forget my phone of course and we run out and get into his car. i explain what happened and he drives us to our friends house. We get there and explain what has happened to her mother. She understands and helps us out. My friend comes home and we all go to a grocery store to get a litter box for the cats and for me to withdraw all my money from my account. I explain to them in detail what has happened. We get back and use my sisters phone text our mother that we are safe while she is threatening with police and court. She sends a pic of her face saying that I hit her and she isn't going to work the next day. She blows up our phone with text as the father gives us advice on what to do. We text our stepfather that we are safe and so are the pets. We turn off the phone and we try to get some rest.

The next day our step dad comes back from work and picks us up. He is shocked with our mothers behavior. We come home and she's asleep. When she gets up she doesnt talk. My step dad tells me to go apologize to try to diffuse the situation even if she was in the wrong. I come up and say ""hey mom, i'm sorry"" she doesnt look at me and doesnt say anything so i leave. She comes into my room and demands my keys and I say I dont know where they are and she says to not touch her car. This morning she came into my room and demands my keys and says to not call her mother. She says to show her my bruises, I dont have any but I say i have two ripped shirts that she threw away. She said it was self defense. She calls me abusive and she tells me to leave the house. I said alright, I'm leaving today and she says that I'm not. The day after my birthday she expects me to be gone. 

&amp;#x200B;

Okay, that was all of what happened, what I need right now is a plan. 

I live in the US

Right now my plan is to save up as much as I can as well as sell some of my musical equipment that I received from a friend who moved out of state (about $1000 worth of stuff). I'm going to move that equipment to my friends house where I can sell it safely.

I'm going to ask for more hours at work to stay away from the house as well as to make money. 

I'm going to ask my coworkers who room together for advice on finding my own place. I will try to stay at my friends house for as long as I am able before I get get on my own feet. 

I don't know if I own this car, I am insured in my name but I think the car is still in my mothers name. 

I don't have my phone, she promised it back to me after work.

I plan on taking documents such as my SC card, passport, diploma, etc. Should i take my birth certificate or should I get another copy from the government.

When should I move out? Frankly, I don't want to stay but I can see that living here at least until I'm 18 would be smart (I turn 18 on the 13th of July)

Please let me know if you have any further advice, I know I did not handle this perfectly, I don't have any evidence besides my sister being a witness. 

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR: My mother drank a lot, drove, sped, got angry at the neighbors for telling her to slow down, hit me, I hit her back, I left the house with my sister to my friends, came back the next day, she calls me abusive, disowns me, and is kicking me out soon."
74,"Husband (33M) cheated on me (29F). How do I walk away?


I’ve been with my husband for 16 years. We have had our ups and downs over the years but we’re very much happily married. He is my best friend. We also have 2 kids.
 

So a few weeks ago he comes home from work and ask me if I would be okay with him having a female friend. Says she was going through a lot, she needed a friend and he wanted to be there for her. I trusted my husband so I said yes. 


A week goes by and one night he’s on his phone and I go to kiss him and he turns the phone away from me. This is not normal behavior. I check the phone bill and see that since the time I okayed them talking he has been texting her from morning till night and having conversations on the phone. I got mad and confronted up about that not being normal. That is relationship stuff not friendship stuff. He defended and said that he couldn’t be the type of friend I wanted him to be and to back off. Despite the red flag, I trusted my husband so I backed off. 


My intuition is going off telling me something is wrong and I keep talking to him but he swears they are just friends. As stupid as it may sound, I wanted to believe him. 


I had a preplanned vacation, just me and the kids as he couldn’t take off of work. The first night I’m away we have a big argument. I tell him I’m not okay with this friendship anymore and it needs to end. He gets mad, screams and me and hangs up the phone. The next morning I call and he tells me he ended the friendship and they are done. I told him that needed to happen but I was hurt and that wasn’t going to go away overnight. He said that if he knew his gesture wasn’t going to be enough, he never would have stopped talking to her. 


That hurt. After a day we just tried to get past it. I was pretending nothing happened, with the idea of us talking when I got back home. We got along really well, back to our normal. Well the next day I couldn’t shake this sinking feeling in my stomach. I knew something was wrong. I cut my trip short and went home. I found him sleeping in bed alone. 


We talked, but I knew he was lying to me. We had about 7 of these conversations. In each he would give me a bit of truth: he drove her around in my car, they had a moment where they almost kissed, they hugged once, etc. But something didn’t feel right. I think I just needed proof of what I thought I knew. One of the big problems was that he wouldn’t let me see his phone. So I signed on our cellphone account and starting reading the messages. He was alerted by our carrier and deleted them. I still saw some of it: He talked about how in love he was. How he never felt so complete. How she was his now. He tried recreating our inside jokes with her. This was only two weeks of them knowing each other. 


It broke my heart but like the idiot I am I still let him explain himself. He swore he never slept with her. He crossed boundaries and he knew it. That’s why he stopped talking to her. He wanted me and our marriage and would spend the rest of our lives making it up to me. 


I fell for it. We tried to rebuild our relationship. Working on being friends and trusting each other. Eventually, we had sex. 


I know many will judge this but at some point I reach out to the girl. We clicked, like you see in movies. She was sweet and honest and I genuinely liked her. Like all the lies were wrong but after talking to her I felt that I understood. In a moment of craziness I decided to try for the three of us to be friends. I suggested it to them both (separately) and they were both happy with it. At some point in us talking about the idea of it over text she reveals that she wants us to have a threesome/open relationship together. My husband tells me what to write to her. He’s totally good with the idea and encourages me to chase after her when she plays hard to get. I was willing to do anything for him, even this craziness. This was just one day of talking. That night he tells me that there is one more thing I didn’t know. He had sex with her and she has herpes. He tested himself and was clean but he couldn’t allow me to be friends with her. 


He tested himself after 7 days and thinks it’s sufficient. I tell him it’s not. I gave him every chance to be honest and he still continued to lie to me. I tried, even considering this crazy idea and he encouraged me to talk to her knowing they fucked. Also turns out that the reason they stopped talking is because she asked him to leave me for her and he said no. I feel like the biggest fool in the world. I can forgive him for lying, for exposing me to a lifelong disease and for being the puppeteer and encouraging me to talk to her. 


I want to leave but I recently lost my job and am unemployed. I don’t know where to go. And my kids love their dad so much and don’t want to leave. They are 12&amp;10. 


I know I was an idiot in all of this. I don’t anyone else to tell me that. But can anyone please give me advice? He is begging me to forgive him. He’s off for the next few days and spends the entire day trying to convince me. Even when he’s not, I can’t seem to stay away from him. I’m so angry and hurt but I have no one to turn to and end up venting and ranting to him. How in the world do I walk away? I don’t think I can stay here for the two months he says he needs before he can get his stuff together and move. 


TLDR My husband had a friendship and crossed lines and I ignored every red flag.  He eventually cuts her off and apologizes to me and says he will spend the rest of his life making it up to me. Except that after sleeping with me and me considering allowing her into our relationship, he reveals that he had sex with her and she has herpes. Being unemployed and having two kids, how do I get myself out of this marriage?"
75,"Just found out my (f25) boyfriend (m23) has been cheating on me and is currently at a weekend long festival with her(f24


Hi everyone, never thought I would ever post on here but here I am. Just looking for guidance on how to not be a crazy ex and how to get over him. 

TL;DR - LDR boyfriend of four years has been cheating on me with his friend that I never trusted, told me not to worry because she is engaged and even made a point not to hang out with her. Turns out she broke of her engagement to be with him. 

I’ve been in a LDR relationship with R for four years, we live in opposite regions of the US and talk to each other a lot throughout the day and sleep with each other at night. I had plans to move to his city soon so we can be together. 

He has a friend M(f24) that I have been wary of from the start and he assured me that she was fine because she was engaged although I thought it was a little worrying that she hung out with R and his friends a lot, even spending a week long camping trip together with just R,M and one of R’s friends. 

Because of my insecurity surrounding M ( and i know that’s an issue I need to deal with myself) R has made a point to spend less time with her and after I asked about her engagement last week, he said he hasn’t spoken to her for a couple months. I had checked her social sites so I knew this was untrue, M has removed all her pictures with her fiancé and changed her relationship status. So maybe R really didn’t know or he was lying (turns out he was lying) 

Fast forward to this week, R has been planning for a weekend festival with two male friends. He has been overly clear that it was just the guys after I asked a couple times about their plans. He’s at the festival right now, and he sends me a car selfie and says his two male friends are sitting in the back because the passenger seat was too hot. In the reflection of R’s sunglasses, I see legs on the dash, legs belonging to M. 

So he lied about her going, he lied about talking to her for the past months and after talking to him tonight and finally admitted that she went along too, but was afraid to tell me because of my feelings towards her. After asking multiple times about the nature of their relationship, he has admitted to having feelings for her. 

M also broke off her engagement two months ago to be with R. Once R found out, he finally confessed to being in a relationship with me and so she’s been aware of my presence. Regardless of R not being single and M knowing that I exist, they continued a flirty relationship that led to being more than just friends. Although they are still in the early stages of their relationship, R has told me that he loves her. 

So of course I’m in shock, I have trusted him and always had a terrible gut feeling about her and all my fears have come true. 

Sorry this is long and winding but I need to get this is all out. I still love him, he says he still loves me but has developed feelings for M. 

So right now, he’s at a festival with a girl that he has feelings for, that he’s been emotionally and physically cheating on me with, sharing a tent with her.  After confronting him about this all last night and finally getting the truth from him, I asked that he not sleep with her at the festival so we can figure this out. 

How do I move on? I love this person so fucking much and have spent everyday of the last four years loving him and missing him. Should I transition out of daily talks with him or just quit talking to him completely? Do I even try to salvage a relationship? Should we remain friends? And I mean this guy is my best fucking friend and I lost him. I talk to him everyday, about everything. He has plans to come to my city in two weeks. My heart fucking hurts but I need some guidance."

tl:dr I ended my relationship with my friend and he misunderstood it. He now thinks that I never liked him and that i exploited him.

&amp;#x200B;

So I finally collected enough courage to end the relationship with my best friend. I wrote him a big letter saying that I our relationship was toxic and that we couldn't continue on with it. I explained that he could be very controlling and that when we have arguments, he uses the silent treatment until I bring the argument up or I apologize. 

&amp;#x200B;

His reaction to this was very bad. He responded saying that he was very disappointed in me and proceeded to explain how good of a friend he is. He said that he had bought me gifts, introduced me to the gym and been there for me when I was sad. This is true, but he is using these previous actions of kindness as extortion material to accuse me of being ungrateful and exploiting him. He said that ""now that you've gotten new friends, it's a good time to leave me, how long have you been planning this?"" 

&amp;#x200B;

Yesterday I woke up only to find out I've lost 10 followers on Instagram. I scrolled through and noticed that it was all of our common friends that had unfollowed. So my former best friend had already told everyone we knew together how much of a monster I am. He even told people that we barely spoke to. This type of smearing is dirty. Those friends, who have only heard his side of the story will now believe it and everyone is going to think that I exploit people, that I am ungrateful and overall a bad human being.

&amp;#x200B;

This annoys me a lot. I'm fine with not being friends with him, but now that he is misunderstanding me it can potentially be dangerous. Right now he's angry and that anger can quickly turn to hate and the hate can lead to ugly consequences."
77,"I (25F) was cheated on after 8 years. Talked to another guy who distracted me from the break up but only led me on. Now I'm feeling really lonely, empty and not sure where to take my life from here.


 

Honestly, I’m not even sure what kind of advice I’m looking for. I think a part of me just wants to rant and to have someone to talk to

I’ve been in a relationship since I was 18, now I’m 25 turning 26 soon, 8 years. My boyfriend and I just broke up after he cheated on me, I won’t go into details on that but lets just say it wasn’t the first or the second time he did it but I forgave him. It’s been about 2 months since we broke up and we still haven’t fully dealt with the logistics such as lease, moving my stuff out etc. When we first ‘separated’ we both agreed that some time apart would do us good, I packed a few necessities and went to my brother’s place, I haven’t seen my ex since then, we broke up over the phone. It wasn’t just a “lets break up we’re done” thing, it happened over many conversations. Honestly, even though I was sad I wasn’t super super sad about it. I think it was because I was sensitized about it because he had cheated a few times over the course of our relationship so it was a bit of a “yeah I saw it coming”.

A month ago I started getting close to this guy, he wasn’t a guy I just met, I’ve known him for years but we were never super close. We met over games and he also lived in a different state so we never met in person. When I started playing the game again as a distraction from my break up, I confined in him and he showed an immediate interest in me. Just talking to me a lot, asking me about my life, complimenting me etc etc. Honestly, it was never super obvious that he liked me, wasn’t really super flirty or said anything sexual. The company really helped kept me distracted from my break up and just kept me from feeling lonely in general. Just 2 nights ago he visited my state, he was just doing a really quick trip for work, we met, talked and hooked up, I left his hotel that night because I didn’t have any belongings with me and he was going home the next morning anyway. Long story short, because like I said, I wasn’t exactly sure how he felt about me I asked him about it straight out. I asked him “what is this to you? Because I’m not really sure how you feel” and that I just wanted to manage my expectations with him. He told me he didn’t want to be with anyone right now. I was obviously, quite disappointed. I didn’t push for any more of an explanation than that, just said ""alright"" and that was it, just felt kindda saddened and weird. Why flirt with me for over a month to only tell me he didn’t want to be with anyone?

Anyway, now that is out of the way I feel, weird. I feel like I’m starting to get anxiety about being alone. It really just feels like… life is so quiet and different. I’ve spent the whole of my adult life in a relationship, I never imagined I'd be afraid of being alone until it actually happened. Friend suggested for me to use a dating app but I feel like it’s too out of my element. I really just want to meet a guy and feel some sort of connection right away but obviously I know I’m not in the right place to do it. Frankly speaking I don’t have a lot of friends right here as well, we’ve moved around a lot. I feel weird living with my brother, then probably having to move out soon to live by myself. How do I manage moving out? what should I take and what shouldn't I take lol, how do we deal with things we ""share"". I’m just.. nervous, lonely and not really sure what to do right now.

Tldr: cheated on by my boyfriend, met another guy, who led me on then told me he didn’t want to be with someone. I feel so odd being single after being in a relationship for 8 years, how do I deal?"
78,"Should I (26M) tell my friend (24F) I lost interest in her because of her gay best friend(20M)?


**tldr** A girl I liked had a best friend clinging to her nonstop and it killed my interest. A year later she posts saying she doesn't know why people don't give her a chance, and I don't know if I should tell her it's because of her best friend.

Two years ago I met a girl through a friend (Tyler, her best friend) and she had similar interests. Then a year ago she approached me and started talking a lot more. We got pretty close over the course of a month, lots of texts, tons and tons of texts and messages, but never ever calling or meeting.

Everything was great about her except for her best friend (who was also my friend). She will get into a phone call with him the minute she's off work, she'll stay in calls with him while texting me, he would join in for anything her and I planned to do. After a month of that I did less with her and my attraction to her died, since I liked her, not her and him.

We dropped contact and two weeks ago she started texting me again and it feels like she's pushing to be close and hinting, saying things like ""you would be such a great father you're such an amazing guy"", ""I remember how handsome you looked wearing blah blah blah"", ""how are you not married already??"". When she made a comment about how I'm not married, I told her I'm in a relationship and I hope it leads to marriage some day and she just responded a day later saying she ""wishes me the best and I can always talk to her about anything and she thinks of me a lot.""

We didn't talk for a few days and I saw she recently posted something along the lines of ""why doesn't anyone give me a chance"". 


She doesn't seem to realize how unappealing it is to have someone else glued to the side of the girl you're interested in. I'm sure I can't be the only guy who got sick of, ""okay! Me and Tyler will be there in 20 minutes!"" When you ask her if she wants to hang out at the mall.

Tyler is an amazing guy, he's extremely nice and positive and is a joy to be around, but suffers from loneliness horribly so it also feels bad taking her away from him.

I feel like I should tell her that the way her best friend clings is what pushed me away, but I don't know if too much time has passed and if it'll even help, or if it's not even my business."
79,"I [22F] am afraid my boyfriend [21M] is too obsessed with me.


I've been dating someone for about three months, and I'm just now starting to realize that some of his behaviors get on my nerves. However, I don't know if there's something wrong with me as a girlfriend that I need to work on, or if he really is too clingy. Is there a measure of clingy-ness that's expected in a relationship?

My boyfriend texts constantly. When we were flirty, I thought it was a cute expression of interest. Now, after I text ""Sorry, I'm working. I'll text later,"" and he follows up with 10-12 texts, I feel myself getting frustrated and resentful. He also calls constantly without warning, which is something I dislike even in my friendships. I have asked him many times to give me some time to respond and to set up a scheduled time we can call each other when we're both free, but he responds with, ""That's not how calls work! They're supposed to be a surprise!""

If I put down my phone for a while to read or work, he'll manipulate me into texting him back with ""Help!"" or ""I'm dying! You won't believe what's happening!"" until I respond with ""What's wrong!?"" Then, he'll just go on to tell me about his day and never tell me what was ""wrong."" If I don't fall for it and don't respond at all for a few hours while I work, drive, or visit a friend, he acts like I've treated him like dirt. He'll say, ""I was really lonely today,"" ""I guess I just need to hold somebody,"" or something equally dramatic.

He's also told me he dreams of me every night, thinks of me all day long, and talks about me to his friends and family constantly. He's written me long letters, poems, and songs. He texts long paragraphs about how beautiful and perfect I am, and how I fulfill all his fantasies. When we hang out, all he wants to do is cuddle and make out for hours on end. He asks if he can visit every single day, even if I'd seen him the day before. I'm realizing that this level of intensity isn't attractive to me at all. In fact, it kind of creeps me out.

The problem is, my family thinks he's the sweetest guy ever. He brings me flowers, goes out of his way to buy me gifts (although I've told him it makes me uncomfortable). He wants to take me on trips, opens car doors for me, and is really a very kind and generous guy. If I told my family I was going to break up with him, they'd never understand how I could break such a sweet guy's heart. I'd really feel like a bad person to break it off, and I'm not sure what I would say.

As someone who hasn't been in many serious relationships, I want to know: am I just not a romantic person? Do I need to take some time to work on myself and my role as a girlfriend? Or is this behavior too clingy and intense? Thank you for your help!

TL;DR: Boyfriend texts, calls, and invites himself over to cuddle multiple times a day and it creeps me out. Is this clingy behavior or am I just not a romantic person?"
80,"Bf masturbated to my friend


My bf and I (22/23 years old) have been together for four years. We have had an amazing relationship with ups and downs of course. Anyways I have this beautiful friend (she has the same body type as me, but I feel like she had a much prettier face than I do. We sometimes look a little similar) since high school. After high school we kind of fell apart but that’s okay that kind of things usually happens. My bf, her and me occasionally hang out, but I never felt insecure about my bf been around her because I trusted him. Anyways not too long ago I had a party and invited a couple of my friends over. My phone wasn’t working so I asked my bf to take pictures on his phone. The next day I asked him for his phone to send the pictures to mine he gave me the phone with no problem. As I was sending the pics to my phone I came across a picture of my friend by herself, then I noticed that he had cropped me off the picture and only left her. When I asked him about it at first he played dumb, but after awhile he confessed to me that he had used the picture to masturbate to my friend. He begin to cry and to apologize (he said I wasn’t supposed to find out, that he had forgotten to delete the picture) he said he doesn’t like it that it was just something stupid he did in the moment. He says he doesn’t have a connection to her, that he loves me and he only wants me. As I kept asking him questions he said that when he was madturbating he imagine of her, me and him were having a threesome, but I don’t believe him because he cropped me off the picture if it was a threesome he could’ve kept me in it. Ever since I found out about this I have felt so insecure, sometimes I catch myself comparing myself to my friend, I was never like this. Yes I have always known my friend is really pretty but that was it now I feel like my bf wants her. He assured me that even if he had the chance to have her he would never do that to me because he loves me but I am questioning our whole relationship. He’s an amazing guy one of the good ones, well at least I thought he was. What do you guys think? Is this normal for a guy to fantasize about friends of their girls? What should I do?

tl;dr... I’m summary bf cropped me off to masturbate to my friend. He’s a good guy but I don’t know how to get over what he did"
