0,"Long-term boyfriend doesn't like my recovery weight


Sorry if this is somewhat long and poorly written, tldr at the bottom!

So I, 27 (f) have been with the same guy more or less ever since I was 16, he's a year older. There was a one and a half year period where we weren't dating, but we've since reconnected and have now been back together for 2 years. 

The issue at hand is that I've struggled with a very ugly mixture of bulimia and anorexia for many years, I can't even remember when it started. I've sort of 'always' been underweight, to the point where friends and family told me I looked sickly and were genuinely worried about my health. For safety reasons I won't name any numbers, but I was unhealthily underweight. 

Anyway, over the past year I've really been taking therapy seriously and have been working on myself. Along with a much needed change in the way I think came a noticeable increase of my body weight. I'm not anywhere near overweight, but I do have hips and breasts and thighs now, and my stomach is no longer concave- and you know what, thanks to an incredibly awesome therapist and the support system of friends and family that I am lucky to have, it doesn't bother me nearly as much as I thought it would. The disordered voice that tells me I need to be thinner, thinner, thinner is still there, but due to the amount of love people have shown me and the hard work I've done with my therapist- along with a solid portion of luck- I am able to silence it most of the time. 

The boyfriend and I have a long distance relationship (his choice, he wanted to study abroad so he did). I went to visit him in another country for 10 days recently, and was happy to see him as I had missed him badly. There were a few moments when he commented oddly on my body that felt weird ('I can see the bulge of your tummy' after a steak dinner, me wearing a thin t-shirt) that I chose to ignore, but one evening he just flat out told me that he prefers me thinner. I didnt know what to say. I felt like he had shoved a dagger straight into my heart (sorry if this is dramatic). I had never felt so ugly in my life, all of my acceptance of my new healthy body just left my head. He suggested I should lose weight, but told me I didn't have to do it by puking and/or restricting excessively. I felt so hurt, misunderstood and offended- we've had countless conversations about my eating disorder, he knows all the facts, he's had all the triggers explained to him, I've even told him if this makes him uncomfortable and he wants to leave, I completely understand- and he still says something like this. 

Unfortunately, it's fucked my brain up good and proper. I've contacted my therapist to set up another appointment to 'minimize the damage', the next appointment is in 2 months. Meanwhile, the eating disordered portion of my brain is having a field day, like a kid left unsupervised in a candy store. Bulimia and restricting are just running rampant and I feel completely out of control. I've tried to explain this to the bf and ask him to not say anything about my weight in the future, but he just won't listen, he says he should be allowed to voice his preferences about my body. 

English isn't my first language, sorry about any mistakes!

Tldr: I love this guy, but he is unsupportive of my recovery. Any advice on what I could do? Am I overreacting because I feel distraught at his reaction?"
1,"I (21F) am distraught because my (23M) boyfriend told OUR *pregnant* female friend that he should have been the one to have her kid.


So my boyfriend and I have been going through a rough patch for a few weeks now. Mainly because he has been having issues with his depression and I’ve been by my side doing everything that I can to make sure he is okay. We just found our our friend is pregnant (she has been with the same guy for 6 years) and my boyfriend had introduced me to her and her bf and we have all been really good friends. She had called me last night and told me she needs to get something off her chest. She showed me texts that my boyfriend had sent her, where he was telling her that he can’t help but feel like the baby should have been his and that he felt like the were gonna end up together. Her response was that he is messed up for saying that and then she asked what about ___ (me) and why he was saying that when he claims that he loves me. He then told her that He “doesn’t know if we’re gonna last” and that he “loves me” but believes that I’m too good for him. Wtf???? I honestly don’t know what to even think. I texted him right after I had this conversation saying I know about everything he has said and that I’m disgusted and that he shouldn’t be with me if he has any thoughts about any other woman like that. He just read the message and hasn’t replied yet. Mind you, we have been together for over a year and been friends since 2015. He always tells me that I’m the person he wants to spend his life with and wants kids with, etc. i’m so upset right now. Advice? What should I do? This is all just weird

TLDR: bf told pregnant friend that he wanted to have her kid, need advice"
2,"[Update]: I [23F] have always had intense, toxic relationships. Finally in a healthy relationship with a great guy [26M] and no idea if what I’m feeling is normal.


[Previous post](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/aiyf0c/i_23f_have_always_had_intense_toxic_relationships/)

A few months ago I wrote about dating an actually stable guy after only having toxic relationships. The post got more traction than I expected so I figured it might be nice to do an update. Thank you so much to everyone who replied to my post, all the replies really helped. 

As it turns out, the guy I was seeing found the Reddit post, clicked that it was me, and talked to me about it. Turns out he actually felt the same way in terms of low intensity but he liked that, and I decided to keep dating him for as long as we kept having fun together. 

Well, I’m happy to say that last week we celebrated being together for six months, and that we are quite madly in love with each other :) 

After we talked I took the advice of some of the commenters and tried to just enjoy my time with him instead of worrying about the depth of my feelings. I soon realised that he’s a kind, thoughtful, intelligent person and we totally get each other. He makes me laugh with the most inane stuff and he thinks my dumb jokes are funny too. We can talk for hours and hours about anything at all and I rarely feel like I have to justify or explain my point of view at all - he just understands me. One of the first times I knew I was really falling in love, we were chatting in bed, and suddenly it was 3 in the morning and I realised we’d been chatting for three hours without a single awkward pause. I’ve rarely had that with anyone else, and never with a previous boyfriend. 

I think most of the commenters were right. My other longest relationships were all built around toxic intensity and wild passion, and while this relationship definitely isn’t lacking in the bedroom, I’d say it’s much more built on a sort of close friendship and respect for each other. It’s certainly not as filled with longing and deep passion as other relationships I’ve had, but honestly I prefer being with him. I feel like I have not just someone to go out with or to cuddle up to, but a genuine life partner - somebody who supports me, who I can talk to about anything, someone who makes me want to be a better person. It just took me a while to realise how much better that calmer, more peaceful love is instead of the rollercoaster/intensely toxic relationships, and I almost made the mistake of thinking that it was boring and throwing it away. I really just needed time to get used to dating someone who doesn’t play games and displays his affection openly and frequently. 

We did have some slight issues with communication - mainly me being afraid to bring issues up/suggest things because of other boyfriends overreacting terribly in the past - but after lots of talking he’s been very supportive and proven himself to be a mature enough adult that he can handle occasional criticism without getting super defensive. It’s been really refreshing to be in such a drama-free relationship. 

Thank you to everyone who replied - you all helped a lot and I’m really glad I took your advice and didn’t just break up with him. I love him a lot and I can see us being together a long time. Thanks :) 

**TL;DR:** Turns out I just needed to adjust to a healthy relationship. Boyfriend is great and we love each other a lot. Everything is awesome, basically."
3,"My (28/M) brother’s (26/M) wedding planning has become extremely dramatic, not sure if I should even go anymore?


My brother (26/M) and his fiancé (25/F) are getting married in about a month, and all the planning leading up to the wedding has been fraught with drama within my family. They decided to have a destination wedding, as part his fiancé’s long planned family reunion. My family will be driving roughly 12 hours to be there.


The costs of everything keep changing – now I’m being asked to pay double what was initially talked about for a room at the hotel, and I just found out from my sister that it’s because my cousins decided not to come because of the cost, so it’s being deflected onto me. My brother and fiancé continue to insist the higher sum was what they initially asked for despite the message I have from them to the contrary. Now the brides father has begun calling me asking for more money.


His fiancé also sent me a long and expensive list of clothing I need to have fitted and purchase as a groomsman, and is now calling every day asking if I’ve ordered it – what’s the ETA, etc. When I didn’t answer for two days because I was busy with work, I got a nasty text from her about how “everyone is busy and it’s no excuse.”


My brother’s fiancé and her family has also been extremely insulting towards the rest of my family – the fiance’s father telling my mother she was irresponsible because she “wasn’t prepared” to pay for a larger sum of the destination wedding. The fiancé got upset with my sister when she refused to pay $200 to “have her makeup done professionally.” My mom is so upset by the way the bride’s parents spoke to her that she is considering not going.


I’m really at a loss of how to navigate this – I feel like I’ll irreparably damage my relationship with my brother if I don’t attend his wedding, yet me and my family are insulted by the bride-to-be and her family each time we interact. I never thought I would seriously consider not going but at this point I am dreading seeing these people, I’ll be spending nearly $1000 just to be there, and they’re asking for “donations to the honeymoon fund,” on top of this all.


I’m worried for my brother because he seems very quiet about this – we’ll talk calmly about the wedding and two hours later his fiancé will text me and be very demanding. Regardless I don’t understand, I’ve been to lots of weddings without all of this insanity.


TL;DR – Brother’s (28/M) wedding is in less than a month, his fiancé (25/F) and her family have been extremely rude to my family and me. Demanding money for their destination wedding and texting/calling nearly every day. Both my mom and I are considering not going due to all of this but unsure if I’ll damage my relationship with my brother irreparably."
4,"I (31F) cut contact with my parents. Sister (25F) wants me to reconnect with them.


Background:

I was a ""difficult child"" growing up, to use my mother's favorite term for me. The oldest of five kids, never interested in boys, really into science and math, etc. My mom especially kept trying to pressure me into more traditionally feminine pursuits, and starting in my junior year of high school started trying to set me up with boys from families she approved of (arranged marriages are common in my parents' culture). We fought, a lot.

I was able to get through all of that and thanks to scholarships was able to go to college. My parents grumbled, but I have a passion for a field that happens to be very high paying, and my mom wasn't subtle about pushing me to get an MRS degree. Things came to a head when three things happened all at once:

I got a terrific job offer from a major company in my field. It required me to move to another state, but they'd pay me to finish my degree. I took the offer immediately, which gave me the independence to do the two other things.

I came out as gay. My parents went back and forth between refusing to believe me and insisting that it was wrong and brought shame on our family.

I converted to another religion. At the time I was getting serious with a woman of a different faith than the one I'd been raised in, and while I didn't convert purely because of her, she was a factor. My parents did not approve to say the least.

In short, the resulting series of fights lead to my parents declaring that if I took this job and continued on my course of being a lesbian and converting to this other religion, they'd disown me. I let them disown me and completely cut contact with everyone in my family except my little sister. She was still living at home with my parents and we'd always gotten along very well, so I quietly kept in contact with her.

I haven't seen or spoken a word to my parents or anyone in my family except my little sister in seven years.

I'm still working for the same company, now in a higher level position that gives me a very comfortable living. I'm also now married to a woman, not the one I'd been dating when I cut contact with my family but of the same religion and faith is important to us both. I have a lovely little girl, my wife's from a previous [heterosexual] marriage and through IVF I'm now pregnant. Our wedding was a small, private thing mostly with my wife's family and some friends. No one from my family was present.

Now:

A few days ago my sister was in a car accident. Drunk driver and she's not at fault, but I was able to step in and cover her medical bills since her job doesn't pay enough for how badly she was hurt. I was on the phone with my sister talking about possibly coming to visit and we were talking about whether my daughter should come with me when I suddenly heard my mom's voice yell ""DAUGHTER?!""

My mom was apparently visiting my sister and grabbed the phone away from her. She started screaming at me about how could I have a daughter, why did I not tell her I was getting married, how could I steal her grandchildren from her, etc. Eventually I snapped, told her ""I have a daughter, you do not have a granddaughter"" and hung up.

Predictably my social media and phone have been blowing up with my parents and relatives who think they have a right to my life and my daughter (and child or children I'm pregnant with) after they disowned me for pursuing a life of my own, being gay, and converting to another religion. They've really focused on my daughter especially, I'm apparently the first of my parents' children to have kids and my parents have gone nuts with OUR GRANDDAUGHTER. I've blocked everyone I can, and my wife (who's been a champ about the whole thing) already took precautions to make sure no one can do something crazy like I've read about estranged parents pulling on this forum - trying to pick up our daughter from school without us, breaking into our house, etc.

Problem is, my sister thinks I'm being mean. She'd like to meet my wife and her niece without hiding it from the family, and thinks I can meet my family somewhere in the middle.

My gut feeling says no, my family burned their bridges years ago and I don't want my daughter exposed to people who think I'm sick, shameful, and sinful for living my life the way I've chosen. My wife agrees.

Still, from someone who's not intimately tied up in this mess, am I being unfair to my parents? Should I hear them out? Or should I just keep stonewalling them?

tl;dr: Cut contact with family over lifestyle choices 7 years ago, recently was put into contact with them on accident. I think I should keep them out, my sister wants me to try to reconcile, not positive what I should do."
5,"I just found out my (39F) husband (43M) is spending $250 a month on junk food and fast food, all while asking me to do things to help him lose weight.


 My husband and I are both overweight. We've both tried various things over the years, but nothing's really worked (mostly due to the fact that we have very inactive lives). Recently I've found a measure of success since I've been biking 25 minutes to work a few times a week and sticking with a light IF diet, but his weight has stayed the same (and even gone up). It's not possible for him to bike to work like I do, so I've been trying my best to encourage and help in other ways. He asked me to try cooking keto for him for a while, which I did despite the fact that I don't eat a lot of meat and was essentially making two different meals for us. He doesn't like to exercise alone, so even on the days I biked to work, I'd go with him to the gym. Keto didn't work, so he asked me to put everything I cook into calorie trackers to make sure that the lunches and dinners I make for him stay under certain amounts.

Fast forward till yesterday, when I downloaded three months of statements from both of our credit cards to get a better grasp of our monthly finances and see if there was anywhere to cut back and save more. This wasn't anything sneaky- I'm the one who tracks our finances and investments and check his bank account once a month to see the various totals so I can put them into a spreadsheet I keep. Technically I'm even on his bank account, although I never really use it.

However, when I started going through the transactions and assigning categories, I realized I was typing in ""Fast food/junk food"" way more than I expected. In the end, my summary showed that he spent over $750 in three months at fast food restaurants and convenience stores. There are visits to donut shops almost every day, plus regular lunches at various places even though I make him a lunch every day. I work full time too, so I do most of the cooking for the week on weekends, and every time I put everything together I ask him what he wants in his lunches during the week, and yet it looks like he's either throwing a third of them out or eating them plus $10 worth of Wendy's or McDonalds.

I don't know how to bring this up with him, or even if I should. We don't set limits on what we each spend (we both work full time, don't have kids, and make enough that even without real budgets we still manage to save decent amounts for retirement). He also makes more than i do, and pays for a bigger portion our monthly expenses. Still, I feel like he's eating himself into an early grave if he keeps this up. In addition, I want to keep being supportive and I don't mind putting in extra work to cook healthily for him, but not if there is literally no point since he's eating out so much.

How do I address this (if you even think I should)?

tl;dr: My husband has been spending an average of $250 a month on junk food.  We don't normally monitor each other's spending- should I take it up with him?"
6,"My neighbor (40s m) keeps being a busy body whenever my housemate (26f) and I (23f) go outside.




I'm a young professional living just outside a small city in the US. I rented out the whole bottom level of a house that has been split into two separate apartments. Me and my upstairs neighbor Claire (who rents the top floor of the house) each have our own space, except for the lawn and porches which are shared.

I quickly became friends with Claire after moving in, she was super sweet and welcoming when I moved to a city where I hardly knew anyone. We spend a lot of time together and she's introduced me to a bunch of her friends too.

We like hanging out outside since the summer is beautiful here. We grill dinner outside on the weekends, have bonfires in the fire pit sometimes and hang out and drink around the fire, we both sunbathe and read in the yard often. We have friends over sometimes too. 

It's the perfect living situation, having my own space but also having a great friend close by. 

Except... Our neighbor to the right, Dylan. He's an insane busybody and it's driving Claire and I up the wall.

Over the last few months, he's...

- Told us off for sunbathing in bikinis in the front yard, saying we should be ashamed of ourselves since there are a lot of families with kids nearby.

- When we've had friends over and they've parked in the street, which has public parking, we caught him putting homemade flyers under their windshield saying that this was a residential neighborhood, and that they'd be towed if they parked in front of people's homes again. (Any legit towing company wouldn't tow them, everyone parked legally, and I figure that's why he just left flyers with empty threats.) A couple of our friends were annoyed at having their cars touched.

- We do anything outside and he will stare which is honestly kind of creepy, being eyed by an older dude day-in and day-out

- We have fires (legally) and he comes over and complains about the smoke

- Someone drove a loud motorcycle through the cul de sac a few times and he assumed it was one of our friends even though it wasn't.

- He complained about the grass in the yard being too long, which is against some rule. And I said that by my lease, it's the landlord's responsibility to maintain the yard, so he should call him. But that hasn't stopped him from telling me to cut the grass, complain about weeds, etc. Each time, I tell him that he needs to tell my landlord if he has a problem with it.

He has a family but from what I've seen, his wife is very quiet and keeps to herself with the two young kids a lot.

I'm just getting so fed up, and kind of creeped out because of how much he's staring. Recently I've started wearing noise cancelling headphones when I come and go from my house, and ignoring him when he yells stuff over the fence when Claire and I are hanging out, but that's honestly made things worse. What can Claire and I do? 

tldr - being driven up the wall by a busybody neighbor."
7,"My husband (M40) and good friend (F38) have started an exclusive friendship.


My husband (M40) and I (F39) have been married for 15 years. We have been close friends with another couple for 6 years. The past 6 months my husband and the woman of the couple have started spending one on one time together often only telling me after the fact, even though these activities are planned in advance. It started with group events they would attend individually that they had invited each other to. Now they are running errands together, having lunch just the two of them and even spending alone time together at my house while I am work. She has become his plus one when I can not attend due to my job. Some of these events do not require a companion and he has stated they can be awkward because people assume she is his wife, yet he continues to take her places. A group text including the two of them, her husband and myself has taken the back burner to them individually texting. I found out his co-workers have a nick name for her as he works retail and she drops by to see him. Am I wrong to think they are headed down a slippery slope? They have both told me I am.

Tl;dr: My husband and close friend have started an exclusive friendship. Am I wrong to think something is going on when they are spending hours alone together."
8,"My (27F) friend (27F) of over 12 years wouldn't accept finals as my reason to not attend her out of state Bachelorette party. I agreed to make it work, but now there's absolutely no plan even though its in 4 days and I'm starting to feel bitter.


One of my best friends of over 12 years is getting married in October and chose a college friend to be her maid of honor. There was just one weekend thrown out to have both a bridal shower and bachelorette party, in a city 600 miles away from me. Unfortunately, it is the weekend that my finals and group projects are due for graduate school and it's the first week of school for me, as I work as a behavior therapist in a school. Once I discovered this, I immediately drafted an email explaining the situation, including several other weekends that my husband and I could come up to celebrate, and apologizing profusely. I get an email back about how everyone's ""busy"", but she thought I would be the one to understand since I just got married (about a year ago) and how she went to all my festivities. Against the wishes of my husband and therapist, who I'm working with to say no during this busy time in my life, I agreed to make it work, and have made arrangements to take finals early and have working with my group to try to finish our work before we leave. 

The party is this coming up weekend, 4 days away. I have not been told a schedule, don't know where we're staying, how much anything will cost, etc. The MOH has been flaky with email, didn't tell me which airport to fly into (since the initial thought was bridal shower in one city and bach party in another, but who knows what the plan is now) so now I'm driving 8 hours on Friday to get there. Since the MOH hasn't been answering me, I had to text the bride asking for a plan and she said she knows nothing either, but asked if I could potentially drive people back from Bach location to bridal shower location, which would add 2 hours to my already 8 hour drive. I have no idea when I'll have wifi to look over my group project and already have to change my work schedule during the first week to accommodate this party, of which, there is literally no plan. 

Originally, my plan was to just suck it up and not add drama to the situation by chalking the rude email up to wedding stress and just not saying anything; however, now I'm at the point where I'm feeling such bitterness toward my friend and basically want her to know how much I'm sacrificing to be there for her and this terribly planned weekend. Do I talk to her about it? What do I even say? 

TL;DR Friend guilted me into attending bridal shower/bach party in a city 600 miles away from me even though I told her I had finals and it was my first week of school, as I work in a school. The party is 4 days away and there is no plan and now I'm starting to feel bitter and don't know whether to say anything or if I should, what to say."
9,"I (33f) keep getting steamrolled by visitors to my house.


Tl;dr Visitors to my home keep ignoring my specific instructions to not do things, is this just how older people visiting are, or how can I be more assertive?

My boyfriend (36M) and I (33F) bought an older house four years ago near a town where we moved. We're from 2 different countries, and we're living in another one. When we have visitors, they have to stay a while because it takes a while and a bit of money to get here. 

I'm running into a recurring problem when we have older visitors coming, from both our families.

The house we bought is not perfect and needs some work, but it’s perfectly liveable. We know we have some large expensive chuncks of renovation that will need to be done (new roof, better isolation) and we've been saving up for these. There are other problems that are small or more cosmetic that would cost some money to fix, but we chose to set these aside while saving up for the rest.

My issue is that when older visitors come (and it's only older people), they decide to go off and fix my house even when I ask them not to.

Example 1: Boyfriend's parents come over for a visit. There was some ivy growing on a wall outside that would need a trim within a couple month. However, our ladder is broken, and my boyfriend knows he can get a ladder from his work in a couple weeks. My father in law decides he's going to trim the ivy, and I explain to him that we don't have a safe ladder to do so, and I'll get to it in a couple weeks. I leave him alone a few minutes to take a shower, and come back outside to find him having built a completely unsafe table to stand on to reach the top of the ivy (like, even less safe than he broken ladder) and trim it. I asked him five times to come down because I could see the structure wobbling and I was terrified he'd fall and get hurt. He ignored me, and when he eventually came down smiled and said ""see, nothing happened"". I was furious. I told him I was angry at him, and even that didn't get through to him.

Example 2: My dad visits with my aunt and uncle. One of the small issues with the house is that the water pressure isn't great. I know the cause, and I know it will take a plumber to have it fixed - we need to replace some pipes that are placed in a way that we need a professional. It's actually not a big bother - just don't do the dishes at the same time someone takes a shower and no one even notices the problem. my dad and uncle decide that they want to fix it anyway. I tells them not to - and explain why I know it will take a professional. Same as with my FIL - I go do something else and before I know it, they've cut the main water to fix the pipes. I go tell them to stop and they don't. Short of me physically pushing them away, I try everything to stop them, no luck. Exactly as I had planned, though, the problem can only be fixed by a professional, and long story short, they mess things enough that we have to cut the water to the whole house until a plumber can be called. It's Sunday night, so I only got someone coming around the next morning. I had to dip into the structural changes savings fund to pay the plumber, and the long term issue with the pressure is still there - we still have to replace the pipes some day. Again, I was furious at my dad and uncle, and they didn't even apologize.

Example 3: my mom is over this week. She was making food in a very nice iron pan we have that we have been seasoning for over a year. This means the bottom of the pan is blackened. If this was a teflon pan, it would be a sign it's unusable, but for an iron pan, it means it's just right. I told that to my mom multiple times, but would not believe me and tried to scrub off the seasoning behind my back, causing small specks to go in the food. Again, these are not dangerous, but we do need to redo the seasoning on the pan now. She nearly destroyed the pan and would not believe me until I made her read the manufacturer's website. 

I am a very conflict-avoiding person. It's already taking a lot of going against my nature to stand up to all these people and say ""no, don't do that"", but I do it every time. I'm sure there's an element of sexism here (this only happens when my boyfriend isn't home). I want to figure out how to make myself more assertive, and for all these people to just listen to me in my own home. I'm tried of getting steamrolled, and I am coming to dread those visits.

Tl;dr Visitors to my home keep ignoring my specific instructions to not do things, is this just how older people visiting are, or how can I be more assertive?"
10,"My(f32) mother(f54) is contacting my friends to find out how to contact my therapist. How do I deal with her?


My mother and I haven't had a good relationship since about the time I turned 13. My pet theory is I was developing into my own person and she couldn't handle the loss of control. She got more controlling, manipulative, and emotionally abusive in response. Which I responded to by rebelling harder and harder. It was a vicious cycle.

She spent most of the time telling me there was something wrong with me and trying to figure out what it was. She'd drag me to family counselling where I'd be asked again and again why I wanted to make my family miserable. My parents nickname for me with their friends was devil daughter. She was constantly making me take personality tests, the meyers briggs one most often. She'd lecture me about how I don't deserve to have self esteem because I had nothing to be proud of. Nothing I did was ever good enough because even when it was...it wasn't something she thought was important.

So I stopped talking to her. And everyone else in my family. Not completely, I still lived with my parents and saw family regularly. But I kept my thoughts and interests to myself and limited conversations to pleasantries. Which was easy because my mom sort of dominated any gathering she was at.

This lead to both my parents starting to pump any friend of mine they met for information about me. Her and my father would search my room while I was at school, one time I got home and they were sitting on the floor of my room reading my journal. She spent the rest of the day interrogating me about the contents.

I spiraled hard after that. Drank a lot, used a lot of drugs, was very promiscuous with much older men. It went on until I was in my late twenties and tried to kill myself. That was when I finally got help and could start sorting myself out. I had no idea my family was a huge part of the problem until I'd been in therapy for a year and a half.

My BF called me this morning to tell me he'd just gotten a call from my mom. She found out I'm seeing a therapist and she was begging BF to give her my doctors contact information so she could tell him the problems she had with me and my behavior. My BF ended up telling her she needed to talk to me about that and hanging up on her. Then he told me and I'm just furious.

I don't know what to do about her. Every response I think of both seems like too much and not enough. I'm so tired of having my privacy invaded, I'm over 30 ffs. I'm sick of hearing every one tell me what a saint my mom is and knowing they'd never believe me if I tried to tell them how she's treated me over my life. I just want to live and be left alone to find my own happiness. I could cut her out, but that means cutting out the rest of my family too. Sometimes I feel like they've built a cult based on the mythology of how wonderful my mom is and I can see on their faces they don't really believe me when I try to give my side of the story. But also they're my family and I love them and it would hurt to not see them anymore. So what do I do?

tl;dr My mother is making me miserable and invading my privacy. Again. How do I get her to stop?"
11,"My fiancé (33M) only touches me (33F) for 5-10 minutes everyday


I’ve been with my fiancé for 3 years and plan to get married next year. We love each other and are committed to building a life and home together.

But I crave intimacy and physical contact. I find myself crying to sleep most nights.

We used to have sex multiple times a week, but now we have sex once a week at most. And if we do have sex, I have to initiate it. I will always initiate foreplay and will almost always give him oral sex. It is rare that he returns the favor. Almost every time, the foreplay is abruptly ended when he tells me, “just get on top”— so he can finish. Sex ends when he finishes. We only have sex when I’m on top because it’s the most pleasurable for him. Sex with him is not intimate. He lays on his back with his eyes closed. There is no touching outside of the penetration. I have to force his hands on my breasts. Sex is sterile and feels transactional. As soon as he’s done, he goes to sleep. I have never orgasmed. On the most frustrated nights, I force his hands into my vagina so I can finish as well. 

When we first started dating, he used to masturbate in bed while I would be next to him. He would masturbate before attempting to initiate sex with me. This erupted in a big fight and he no longer does this. Now I can’t help but feel like I’ve just replaced his hand. 

A few weeks ago, we went camping and he couldn’t sleep. He wanted to have sex so he can orgasm and sleep. That was obviously not the most romantic way to go about initiating sex. I’ve never felt so used in my life.

After work every night when we are home, we will kiss each other sporadically the night. His kisses are just little pecks on the lips when we’re watching tv. I barely feel his lips. I have to pull him towards me to ask for a real passionate kiss. I ask to cuddle or hug or embrace but he says it’s not comfortable for him to do so on the couch.

Every night, we’ll be on the couch (not touching, with a body of space between us)  and then he will take a hit of marijuana and all of sudden will say he’s going to bed. He’ll crawl into bed as I get ready for bed. When I’m ready to sleep and get into bed, he’s already sleeping and I have to strain myself to reach over to kiss him on the lips goodnight.

As we are in bed, his back is towards me. It is hard for me to fall asleep without warmth or some physical touch. I find myself grasping at a pillow and putting a pillow on my back to mimic that physical human comfort. Again, I will cry myself to sleep or go on my phone until I’m tired. At this point, he is fast asleep.

He wakes up before me and I feel that he is. Every day I feel a little hope that he will grab to cuddle me. But every day he will only cuddle when he knows I’m half awake and will do so for about 5-10 minutes before jumping up to sit on the couch, go on his phone, watch espn and walk the dog. I hear these activities every morning as I lay in bed awake, with my pillows again near me for physical comfort.

On weekend nights, I get the most sexual energy from him, but that is after him getting high all day. Again the sex feels very one sided, but at least he will tell me  he wants sex. The night on a sex night will end with him rolled over and again without me feeling recognized.

I have tried talking to him on several occasions but it usually ends up with him yelling at me saying it’s all not true and “we do cuddle!!!” With all the yelling and the lack of change, am I doomed for a marriage with zero intimacy?

TL;DR - My love language is physical touch and I’m not feeling loved."
12,"I [24F] am feeling disappointed that date night wasn't what I expected. BF [25M] says I should have had fun regardless.


My BF \[25M\] of 1 year and I \[24F\] had plans yesterday to go to a fair that is in his town. I was really looking forward to this because I had a long day at work and a rough dentist appointment that day. He lives a little over an hour away from my office so I left straight from work at 5. I had not been to a carnival in a long time so i was excited to do all the cheesy couple things games, rides, etc.

When we got to the fair he mentioned he wanted to see a horse race. I initially thought this was cool because I had never seen one. When we were walking to the track i mentioned at some point we had to get food because I hadn't eaten since 12:30 and it was now 6:30. he said I should grab something now because we would be at the track for a while, so i got a pretzel. 

When we went in the track five of his friends were already there and we spent the next 3+ hours watching races and him and his friends were placing bets. I felt like I didn't have much to add to the convo because I don't know anything about gambling or horse racing. After that, his friends wanted to all meet at a bar in the fair.

I told BF that I wasn't expecting to spend the whole night drinking because I had to drive home at 6:30 am for work, he said we drink all the time. I said I felt like I was intruding on what should've been a ""guys night"". He said I need to learn to adapt and not let it ruin my whole night.

It was obvious by the end of the night I was tired and not in a great mood. I felt bad for wanting to leave but it was close to 11:00 and I had to be up at 6:30 to drive an hour home then straight to work. Now I feel like I ruined the night. Was I wrong for feeling disappointed? 

TD;LR I wanted to spend a date night with just my BF, he wanted us to stay out drinking with his friends and was annoyed that I wanted to leave, and wasn't having fun."
13,"My (30F) husband (28M) is angry about EVERYTHING and I can't take it!


My husband and I both suffer from depression but unlike me who has learned to cope (after many years of therapy), by doing my very best to always look for the bright side, he seems to RELISH in the anger.

EVERYTHING makes him angry! Just today we had a discussion about pop music (he listens to heavy metal of course) and he started getting enraged how all pop music is worthless and people who listen to pop music are assholes (sounds more like metalheads to me) and he got so angry when I calmly asked him for a logical reason why he felt that way.

He literally hates everyone and everyone the whole world, even his family (who are just fine if you ask me), except me. He's a GEM to me, absolutely perfect husband, and never takes his anger out on me.

But I have a really hard time keeping my mental health in check when he's not even trying to combat the rage and has outwardly stated he has no interest in doing so.

He feels just fine being angry. What do I do?

TL;DR - Husband is full of rage at life and isn't looking to calm down. Harbors irrational anger for everything except me."
14,"I (F29) am losing attraction to my (M29) partner, but I'm not sure how to tactfully address this with him without hurting his feelings


I'm hoping I don't come across as an awful and shallow person, but I'm starting to lose some attraction to my partner. We've been together for almost five years and this is becoming more of a turn-off as we get older. 


I love his personality and love him as a person, but I'm losing attraction because he doesn't take care of himself, put in any effort to take care of himself, or our things. 


I have a few examples off the top of my head. He complains about his body acne ALL OF THE TIME. He picks at it before bed and it leaves blood marks on our sheets and pillowcases or leaves marks on the mirror from him picking at it. His body acne does not bother me in the least, but blood and goop on our pillowcases and mirror does. He makes no effort to clean it up or just not do it in the first place. I also bought him body wash for his acne after he complained over and over again, but it just sits untouched. I've offered to make a dermatologist appointment, but he doesn't want to go, he just wants to complain. Even the fact that I'm offering to make appointments, buying body wash, and reminding him to wipe off the mirror makes me feel like I'm living with a 16 year old. 


He eats horribly. Lots and lots of fast food. We only eat nutritious meals because I make them. If I leave for work he's back to eating junk and makes jokes about how he eats junk when I'm not there. It's just a turn-off and isn't funny. We both ate crappy in our early 20s, but I've started to take care of myself more as I've gotten older and he just doesn't care. It's just a huge turn-off. I'll mention diseases that run in our family and that it's important to exercise and eat well to prevent that and he just shrugs it off. He gripes about public health and how people in the U.S. don't exercise and overindulge all while he just puts junk into his body and doesnt make any effort to get off of the couch. 


He'll wear socks/shirts with holes or stains unless I buy him clothes to wear. If I don't buy him clothes, he'll just continue wearing raggedy shirts from high school. I don't particularly care how he dresses, it just isn't always appropriate for the venue and is kind of embarrassing. I also don't want to constantly shop for him like I would for a kid and want him to be an adult and walk into a store if he needs to and buy something for himself. 


I really do love him, but I guess I just want to feel like I'm with an adult instead of a teenager. I don't want to outgrow each other, I just want him to act like an adult and not feel like I have to take care of him and do everything for him. He appreciates that I eat healthy, exercise, and try to look nice for him, but he doesnt do the same in return. I'm not sure how I can tactfully bring this up without hurting his feelings? I don't want to change who he is or bring down his self esteem.  I love his personality and him as a person, I just want him to grow up. 


Tl;dr Partner doesn't put in any effort into taking care of himself and it's becoming a turnoff as we get older. Oftentimes I feel more like a parent who is taking care of him than his GF. I'm losing attraction because of this. I want him to grow up, but I'm not sure how to tactfully tell him this without hurting his feelings or making him feel like I'm attacking him."
15,"I (25F) found a tracking device on my car, and I think my husband (27M) put it there.


I have no idea what's going on, or what to think.

Two days ago, I told my husband around dinner that I was going to get the oil changed in my car. He asked me when, and I told him in the morning. After dinner, he went out to the garage to check the oil change date on his car.

So the next day (yesterday), I got my oil changed and everything went fine. 

This morning, I noticed that the steering was a little weird, and my tire pressure was a bit off. I brought it into the shop to have it looked at in case there was a problem with the steering alignment etc etc. They told me it was just a small nail in the tire, causing a leak. They patched it up. The mechanic told me that he found a small tracking device on my car. It was on the body of my car, where the back passenger tire was. He took a picture of it, but didn't touch it out of caution. 

I was shocked. I had no idea who or why someone would put a tracking device on my car. The only logical explanation I could think of is that it was my husband. They didn't see it the first time, and the mechanic was very certain he didn't see it (or else he would have told me). I think my husband removed it when I told him I was going to get my car checked out. He doesn't act weird or anything, and I'm just so confused. 

how do I talk to him?

&amp;#x200B;

tl;dr- the mechanic told me he found a tracking device on my car, and I think my husband put it there"
16,"I (M15) need help with my relationship with my girlfriend (F14).


Hi, it's my first time posting here so if its not good or belongs somewhere else just let me know.

I need some advice about my relationship. I have been dating this girl (F14) for about 4 months. I love her so much but I'm scared that I'm not being a good bf due to a point my friend raised with me. My girlfriend and I haven't kissed and I've been told I should've just kissed her already. The reason I haven't kissed her yet is I've been trying to give her space and go at a pace she's comfortable with. I'm really scared of making her uncomfortable or scaring her away as well due to past experiences. 

What can I do to push through my fears and show her intimacy, and what can I do to be a better boyfriend?

TL;DR: I, M15, want to be the best boyfriend I can but I'm scared to make my girlfriend (F14) uncomfortable."
17,"My boyfriend (23M) now wears a necklace gifted to him by his coworker (24F) who has previously confessed having feelings for him


Here is some background (all names have been changed)...

I (22F) have been dating my boyfriend DJ (23M) for a year and a half. Just over a year into our relationship, a mutual friend of ours named Allie (24F) confessed to DJ that she has feelings for him. DJ and Allie work together freelancing in the same creative field, so I think those feelings developed while they were working on a project together. 

Allie's confession was in the form of a text where she essentially said, ""I need some space because I have feelings for you."" I know this because DJ showed me the texts and informed me of the situation right away. I felt crushed, not at DJ, but at Allie because I thought she was my friend and would respect me and my relationship with DJ more than that. 

In my opinion, her confession seemed like she was putting out feelers with DJ to see if he maybe felt the same way about her. She said she needed ""space"" to get over her feelings for DJ mere hours before they were to attend the same work party, which just reinforced my thinking that she was actively trying to make moves on him. DJ disagrees and thinks Allie was just texting him to try to clear the air between them and move on in a professional matter. Anyway. DJ ended up replying to Allie saying that some space would be good.

Prior to this confession, DJ agreed to work on a long term project for Allie. After the confession, they agreed to proceed with the project anyway, which they have now been working on together all summer. While this confession ended my friendship with Allie (which still bums me out to this day), DJ has maintained a friendly/professional relationship with her.


Now for the necklace bit....

DJ just had a birthday and I spent the entire day with him. After that day, we were both really busy, so I didn't see him for a week. Today was the first day we've hung out since then, and he shows up at my house wearing a necklace. I noticed it right away and asked why he's wearing it. This dude does NOT wear any jewelry, the closest he's come is this one time we made goofy bracelets together (which he never wears). 

When I ask him about it, apparently it's a birthday gift from Allie. She decided that a necklace would look good on him with the shirts he likes to wear (they have a low collar) so she gave him this necklace for his birthday. Now, all of a sudden, DJ is a jewelry guy. The whole situation made me very uncomfortable, and when I told DJ this, it spiraled into a fight.

I feel like a necklace is a pretty intimate gift, and it really upsets me that he accepted it and wears it around. The last thing I want to be is a controlling partner, and while I did tell him the necklace situation makes me really uncomfortable, I don't want to be manipulative. I can honestly say from the bottom of my heart that I'm not jealous of Allie, but I really don't like her and talking about her makes me feel angry and sad. It hurts me that DJ seems to disregard how much Allie hurt me when she confessed her feelings for him. Am I being unreasonably upset over this stupid little necklace? The idea of asking a partner to ""Not wear *item*"" seems obnoxious and controlling to me, but in this case I find myself wanting to say it. Advice on how to handle this situation would be appreciated, I would like boundaries to be respected without being controlling or manipulative.

TL;DR: My boyfriend now wears a necklace given to him by his coworker who has previously confessed to having feelings for him. I feel uncomfortable and don't want him to wear the necklace, but I also don't want to be controlling."
18,"[Update] I'm divorcing my abusive husband and am being harrassed by his family. [30F/M] What do I tell my boss/team when I don't want them to know the details?


 

Original post: https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/bz1jaz/im\_divorcing\_my\_abusive\_husband\_and\_am\_being/

So I told my boss the blunt facts instead of a ""curated version"". 

I'm escaping an abusive situation, blablah, I need my obligations reduced. I cried a lot.

He was absolutely fantastic. The best boss ever. Even weeks after he asked about whether I'd found a support system etc. 

I got so much time off, and he made it clear that I could take even more off as needed. A few times I was emotional and chatted with him about my personal situation or ranted about something, which is probably bad. I also feel really guilty for multiple reasons. For example, a contractor on my project will see its hours reduced if my low output continues.

My mental health is really poor but I have a therapist now. Also the abuse situation calmed down enough that my life is no longer at risk. There is more to execute on my escape plan, but the mental health crisis is so bad that I am paralysed. 

But that's ok too…

The first step of the escape was to be safe. I did that. The second step is to get a little bit stronger, and not doing anything is part of that. I think? 

The third step is the biggest and will involve moving again and complete the divorce \*(lots of context here, legal actions halted for my safety. Planning to move to a location not known to anyone. Out of all my family, friends and acquiantances, only two, fricking TWO, people did not act as flying monkeys. Remember that a restraining order can be broken…)\*.

After going through so much abuse and sometimes literal torture, it often feel like I can never be okay again. This job probably saved my life. It's not the money, it is the HOPE. I can tell myself when feeling worthless, that I am at least worth an hourly dollar amount, that I can do shit. I can tell myself that I have this platform and can rise up by working harder. And it also gives the tiniest amount of structure to my (non-off) days, which feels good for my mental health.

\###”If you can look up, you can get up.”

TL;DR I have the best boss in the world. As much time off as I want... and he was also understanding, concerned and supportive!"
19,"My boyfriend made a medical decision about me behind my back


Tldr: bf offered to buy me a sugar monitor machine for my diabetes, only to admit 2 months later that he doesn't want me to have one at all

I was diagnosed with diabetes 6 months ago. I don't need to do insulin shots luckily. My partner and I want to start a family but the nurse that's following me suggested to wait until I have my glucose level under control. In order to do so, she suggested a couple of months ago that I buy a sugar blood monitor to keep an eye on which foods make it worse etc.
My partner said that he would get me one from amazon as soon as he got paid. He kept making excuses about why the monitor isn't here yet and every time I suggested I'd buy it myself he would get offended, saying that he wants to take care of me etc.
Well, last night I had enough and said that today I'd go buy it myself and that's when he confessed that the reason why he hasn't bought it is because he doesn't want me to self medicate. I was in shock. Not only that's the stupidest, most ignorant thing I've ever heard (he thought I meant I'd be injecting myself stuff), but I feel disgusted and betrayed. How dare he makes (wrong) medical decisions concerning me without talking to me first? I've never been so angry and disappointed in him and right now I cannot even look at him, even if he admitted he has done wrong and apologised profusely. 

Am I overreacting?"
20,"My [26F] husband [34M] is doing an activity that he knows I want to do by himself for my birthday.


I'm pretty upset right now. Me and my husband have always talked about skydiving together. Well for context, we had a child not that long ago and I haven't lost all the weight from the pregnancy yet (though I've been working on it). 


He told me the other night that he reserved a ticket for skydiving for my birthday... but he only bought one for now and will get mine after I weigh myself in front of him. I told him I'd rather him not know my exact weight, and asked why he needed to know it. He said you had to be within a certain BMI to do the skydiving so I told him to tell me what that was and I'd just tell him if I could do it. He kept refusing saying he wanted to know my exact weight. 


When I told him that I probably don't hit the BMI requirements (he barely passes and I know mine is higher than his) and that maybe we should just stick to eating out for my birthday. He got mad at me for not being able to do it and said that hes going anyways and I can find my own thing to do alone for my birthday, and that I'm lucky he was drunk most of my pregnancy because he probably wouldn't of stuck around if he noticed I gained so much weight.


I'm heartbroken right now. I'm already sensitive about my weight (which was in big part due to undiagnosed thyroid problems), and I can't believe he'd go do something I've always wanted to do on my birthday and leave me to celebrate alone.


Tl;dr husband is going skydiving for my birthday, knowing ive always wanted to, leaving me to celebrate alone because I gained too much weight during pregnancy."
21,"My [F28] neighbor [F50 maybe?] has taken it upon herself to inform the rest of the neighbors that my German Shepherds are dangerous.


I just moved into my new neighborhood. Single gal, two German Shepherds. At 28, I’m definitely on the younger side of the demographic here, but that may or may not be part of the issue.

The dogs are German Shepherds, one black and one bi-color so I do understand that visually they’re intimidating (as GSDs of any color can be, really), but they’re both *exceptionally* well trained and under control at all times. They don’t bark or growl or freak out over other dogs/people, and when we’re outside of the yard I follow all the neighborhood leash laws.

I have been training dogs since my late teens and have owned working dogs for over a decade. I take part in a number of training “clubs,” including a bite club and tracking club. My new place sits on a hair over two acres with a large expanse of open grass on one side, so I periodically host other trainers and dogs, and this is where the problem with my neighbor seems to have started. 

The neighbor in question was walking by with her husband as a group of four or five of us trainers were working with about ten dogs. Bite suits and sleeves, so “aggressive” but obviously under control. Dogs trained in personal protection and bite work have a solid on/off switch. Frankly, they’re much safer than dogs NOT trained in bite work.

The next day, said neighbor stopped me at the mailbox and informed me my dogs should be leashed anytime they’re outside or behind the back fence. -
She was also adamant I have “beware of dog” signs (I actually do in my front window and on the fence gates). The next morning, I found a handmade sign warning about my dogs posted in front of my lot. I took it down. Since then, I’ve also been treated to a letter from the HOA stating a complaint had been made about my “aggressive” animals. When I called the board representative to inquire about the details of the complaint, he was unable to cite a specific incident with the dogs, only stating that my neighbor had seen them display what she referred to as aggressive behavior. I advised him not to contact me again without an actual incident, which meant I’d never hear a peep again. I invited him and any other HOA members who were concerned to come meet my dogs and watch them work. Now I’ve heard from a couple other neighbors that they’ve received letters stuffed into their doors warning them about my dogs. A couple of these people have met my dogs and find it laughable, but when I run or bike with the dogs I also see people I don’t know as well cross the street to avoid us.

Do I even say anything to this busybody woman with the issue, or do I just let it go? If I do say something, what do I say?

**TL;DR:** My [F28] new neighbor [F50 maybe?] is apparently terrified of my GSDs. She’s taken it so far as to complain about them to the HOA and stuff “anonymous” letters about them into other neighbors’ doors. Do I approach her or just let it go?"
22,"My wife (35F) won't stop spending most of our spare cash on her mom


My wife (35F) and I (37M) are currently fighting over what to do about her mom (63F) and I need some advice on how to reach some kind of understanding.  For three years, my wife and I have been financially supporting her mom.  My wife is an only child.  This started when my wife’s father passed away and escalated more when her mom had to go on medical disability.  At the time, we just wanted to try to help her through a tough time.  She had been living on her acreage for decades and desperately wanted to keep living there as long as possible.  My wife and I had enough spare cash every month that we didn’t have much trouble doing this.

Soon after this, my wife became pregnant with our son and he was born in June of 2017.  Parenthood has been great so far, but it certainly added a lot to our monthly living expenses.  Even though money was tight, we still were able to maintain a decent amount of savings and keep our credit card debt low.

In the summer of 2018, my MIL’s car crapped out on her.  My MIL had no money to buy a new car so my wife and I had to buy one for her.  This was a real turning point for us because we had to use a large chunk of what was left of our savings for a down payment and the new car loan and insurance bill put us close to living paycheck to paycheck.  We have been spending about $900 a month on her since then.  Lately, we’ve had no choice but to charge any large unexpected expenses to our credit card.

I can’t really stop my wife from spending this money on her mom.  Our paychecks still go into our respective personal bank accounts that we had from before we started dating.  My wife basically spends whatever is needed on her mom and then spends whatever is left on our bills and her personal expenses.  I have no access to her account.  I know that she regularly burns through her entire paycheck by the end of each month. 

I’ve confronted my wife about our dangerous financial situation multiple times and she is still strongly committed to continuing as usual despite having no plan for how we could get back on a more solid footing financially.  She even told me I should divorce her if I don’t want to deal with this anymore.  It seems that she desperately wants to be a hero for her mom and prevent her from feeling any sort of hardship ever again.

What’s particularly frustrating is that the math doesn’t really add up when it comes to my MIL’s finances.  Despite us paying all of her bills, my MIL is always short on cash.  Somehow, she’s blowing through about $1100 a month and doesn’t have much to show for it.  This is in rural Iowa so that amount of money should be way more than enough for food and basic necessities for one person.  She has a few pets, but I don’t see how she could be spending more that $250 a month on them.  I’m not allowed to question this though.  It just leads to a fight with my wife.

At this point, I’m just done emotionally with this situation. I’d estimate that we’ve spent about $25,000 on my MIL.  I’m tired of not having any money. I’m tired of being expected to do grunt work around my MIL’s acreage.  I’m tired of not having any time and money to work on my own house.  I’m extremely frustrated with my MIL’s reluctance to make any necessary lifestyle changes.  I’m angry at my wife’s insistence on enabling this behavior.

I could really use your help Reddit!  How can I get my wife to see that we can’t continue to throw all our spare cash at her mom?  How can I convince my MIL that she needs to start living within her means even if it means giving up her dream of living on her acreage?

TL:DR - My wife if spending almost all of our spare cash on her mom and I don’t have a good way to stop her."
23,"Husband [34 M] says he's not in love with me [34 F] after 14 years.


 

My husband and I have been together for 14 years, married for 9. We have two boys, ages 3 and 5.

I love my husband. He is a truly good man in a way I feel is very rare today. He is always kind and does what he thinks is right. We do not fight. I am a much better person today because of him.

My husband says the spark is gone from our marriage. He says he loves me, as a family member and a partner, but that he is not ""in love"" with me. He says things have been really downhill for the past three years. I acknowledged that I de-prioritized our relationship when our second son was born. We stopped spending time together as a couple and just did our own thing when the kids were sleeping. But I am still in love with him. I still crave his arms around me and smile when I see him walking towards me.

Physical affection is sort of limited. He kisses me, but its just perfunctory. He lets me snuggle him but I think that is just out of kindness. We do have sex occasionally, but he says sometimes he ""feels bad afterwards"".

He recently developed a crush on another woman. He had a conversation with her where he shut down their relationship before it crossed a line. I think he is feeling heartbroken about it still. He felt that wonderful rush when he was around her. He wants that feeling in his life again but I don't think a 14 year relationship can really deliver those intense feelings.

My hope is that these crush feelings will pass and that my husband will rediscover romantic feelings for me. I asked him if he thought we could get that spark back, and he just shrugged and said ""Well, I guess we have to try.""

I know I can't control my husband's feelings, but want to do everything I can right now to win him back. I am losing weight, dressing better, exercising and getting into his hobbies. We are spending time together in the evenings and taking a day off from work to spend together in a couple of weeks. We can still have a good time hanging out together, even if its just friendly.

We have had several conversations about all of this.  It's painful but I'm glad we are being honest with each other.

I imagine ""falling out of love"" after over a decade of being together is a fairly common experience, so I am hoping to hear from others who have gone through this with their spouse.  Right now, I am just so sad and terrified.  I miss seeing him smile when he sees me.  I can't believe I might never see that smile again.

tl;dr: My husband doesn't have romantic feelings for me anymore but we still get along and are kind to each other."
24,"I (28/M) am putting off proposing to my GF (27/F) until we can come to an agreement about her $300k in student loan debt and $20k in credit card debt


I’ve been dating my SO since October of last year and am strongly considering making this woman my wife...but


She has $290k in student loan debt and wants to wait 10 years for her loans to be forgiven. 

She is a doctor, an OB GYN doctor and I work in a hospital earning about $50k annually. She wants to take on a mortgage NEXT year. 

I am torn between switching fields and doing a code boot camp to increase my income by at least $10-15k to help pay off the debt sooner. 

Ideally, if the chips fall into place correctly, we could strike a 3-4 year plan to pay off the debt halfway through her designated “plan” to depend on the government.

I want to have this conversation with her soon because I have plans on proposing sometime I. February (doing the ring fund soon). 

Any tips on how to tackle debt as a couple? I don’t know where to start... and if we can’t come to a consensus on this; then I’ll indefinitely have to put off proposing. I’m in no way interested in being over half a million in debt... trying to build wealth here and yes, I do listen to Dave Ramsey...


TL; DR - GF has $300k in student loan debt and I want to propose but I’m putting it off until we can come to a consensus on how to tackle the debt."
25,"How do I convince myself that I didn't see a text I'm positive I saw?


TL;DR I thought I saw a text on my wife's phone saying ""love u 2"" to someone else.


So yesterday I (M29) was setting up a new WiFi router at home and I was connecting all the devices back to it, I asked for my wife's (F28) phone to connect it for her and when I pulled down the notification bar to go onto the WiFi I see a text thread. I'm positive that one of the messages said ""love u 2"". She quickly took the phone back and swiped the notifications away. When I asked her who she was texting she said ""no-one"" in a sarcastic way, like she was trying to hide something. I let it stew for a few hours while I had thoughts running around my head! 

I eventually asked her again and she said it was probably some shit that she had been sent. She promised that she never sent the text and that she hadn't said she loves someone else and all that. We've been inseparable since we left college about 12 years ago now and I like to think I know her pretty well. I know she isn't the type to just randomly hook up with guys or start flirting with anyone, she's really just a shy girl! I absolutely do trust her but I'll bet my life that I saw what I saw. 

How do I stop the war going on in my head?"
26,"Sister [14f] got cut from volleyball tryouts and cried. Is there anything I [21m] can do?


She spent pretty much the entire winter break practicing and playing in different street or academic venues to get better and pass the tryouts (she was also cut at the start of the school year), but she was cut too.

She came back home and locked herself in the room and cried. I went in and gave her a hug and she kept crying.

Last time she was cut she was a lot more motivated and more like this was a challenge she could overcome by winter break, but this time she just cried her heart out.

I don't really know what to think. Like, maybe she's... not that good? Or maybe the competition is too hard in her school? I don't really know much about volleyball besides the basic but she's worked enough that there's a noticeable difference in her game before vs now.

From what I've seen, she's been pretty realistic about it, too. I've never seen her make any bragging comments or even claim that she's good, she's basically all about training more. No excuses.

So, damn. I don't know. Is there anything I could do? She's been in her room since she came back. Didn't have dinner even though I made something she likes (not like, ""eat this and get better"", I just did to maybe see if she liked it).

Anything I can do at some point?

**tl;dr:** Sister was cut from volleyball tryouts at the beginning of the school year, trained for months, and now got cut again. She cried her heart out when she came home. Is there anything I can do to help her feel better?"
27,"My (21F) dad is angry that we don’t interact with him but interacting with him sucks


My dad is a very confrontational/aggressive, narcissistic, controlling person and is emotionally abusive at times. 

Our relationship broke down in my teen years and now I just act civil/try to avoid him when I’m living at my parents house. Honestly I’m pretty much NC with him when I’m living elsewhere.

I’ve tried to ask him questions about things, he always gives a condescending answer as if my questions are stupid. If I try to talk to him about things in my life he will act in the same way, very short, pessimistic and simply mean replies. When *he* is in a good mood and wants someone to talk to he will make you sit there while he rants at you for as long as you let him. Other than this, he will only speak to me if I’ve done something ‘wrong’. I don’t enjoy any of our interactions at all and my brother is the same.

I don’t know how he can be so blind to not see that we don’t enjoy speaking with him and that we aren’t happy around him. I honestly feel like a shell of a human around him.

Does anyone have a similar situation/know how to deal with this?

TLDR My dad wants his kids to interact to him more but doesn’t know how to interact with us nicely."
28,"My [19f] boyfriend [22m] is absolutely intolerant to anything ""mainstream,"" and makes fun of me for the things that I like. He doesn't understand why it's hurtful/annoying.


My boyfriend and I have been together for 2 years. When we met, I was 17 and still in my phase of ""everything mainstream sucks, I'm different and cool!"" We avoided things like like pop music, reality TV, mainstream fashion culture, whatever like it was the plague. Anything that got too popular was automatically ""lame"" to us, end of story. 

I don't feel that way anymore at all. I started listening to ""basic white girl pop music"" sometimes, watch ""trashy"" TV shows, wear what I want whether it's trendy or not, much to my boyfriend's dismay. I just like what I like, I'll try anything once. I've also matured a lot in the past two years, and I don't judge people for the things that they like/enjoy anymore because life is too damn short. I like to feel that respect and treatment in return from the people that I surround myself with, and for the most part, I have, except for my boyfriend.

The issue for me isn't that he doesn't share my tastes. Obviously I wish he would be a little more open minded and at least attempt to share these interests with me, but that's another story. I just want him to stop scoffing and making sarcastic comments every time I bring something up that I like and he doesn't. I just don't know how to get it across how annoying it is that he does this. I've brought it up before and he doesn't take me seriously. He just does it again the next time. It's like he can't help himself.

For example, the other day I was folding my laundry in his room and had  ""pop"" music (he hates Khalid, I like him) playing in the background. Bf walks in and IMMEDIATELY he starts going off about how he doesn't understand how I can listen to and enjoy such ""generic, shitty music"" and asking me to turn it off. He only ever wants to listen to music that he already likes; if I play music that he thinks is stupid or generic he immediately asks me to turn it off. It's really frustrating.

Or another day, we were in bed and doing our own thing on our computers. I decided to watch an episode of Riverdale. This was met with comments about how terrible the acting/writing is, that watching it is a waste of time, etc. Anytime I bring up a TV show that I'm watching that he thinks is trashy, he'll immediately shut down the conversation and say something like ""I really don't wanna listen to you talk about this."" 

This is really hurtful to me. He's my best friend, and I don't like feeling judged. He's a great boyfriend in most other areas, so it's not breakup-worthy for me, but it's really wearing on me. When he makes comments like this, I'll sometimes call it out and respond with something like ""why do you have to judge the things that I like? I don't judge the things that you like, so please stop doing it to me"" but he just scoffs and shrugs it off and does the same thing again next time. I don't know how to make him take me seriously and stop. I'm at a loss for how else to bring this up and make him listen to me, and would really appreciate any suggestions.

TL;DR: My boyfriend makes nasty/sarcastic comments about the things that I like but he doesn't. I've tried to express that it's hurtful and just plain annoying when he does this, but he won't listen to me. Need advice on how else I can attempt to bring this up and actually get through to him."
29,"Me [32/F] with my boyfriend [36/m] of 2.5 years has been treating me less and less like a partner.


My guy and I have been in a rough patch but it doesn’t seem to be coming to an end. We fight constantly because he expects me to spoil him all the time. And I literally mean all the time. I could be in bed falling asleep and he will “subtly” ask for a drink or a snack. And I mean my glasses are off I’m snuggled in the covers and he does this. Or asks for a massage or various other things. 

In the beginning, we spoiled each other.  He treated me like a queen and I didn’t mind spoiling him because he always seemed to want to spoil me too. Now, he doesn’t do anything for me. He doesn’t offer to get me something to drink, or rub my back or anything.

 Best example; I was bed ridden for almost two weeks because of a severe back injury. I couldn’t go to the bathroom without help because it was so painful to walk. The first day I was relieved because he was legitimately concerned. He took me to the doctor and after, he did things like make sure i was comfortable and got me a heating pad and other things so I would be comfortable. 

That same night, I had been crying from the pain, the meds the doctor gave me weren’t working, I’m laying in bed trying to sleep and he climbs in bed and says “okay massage me”. I said “are you serious?” And he says “yes my back hurts too”. He went with me to the doctor who said that I threw out my back pretty severely and that unless I had to move to not to. 

Last week, he called me and said we were going out. Like a night on the town with friends. We haven’t gone on a date like that in close to a year. I got all dressed up, met him at his house and we didn’t go. He sat and played on his phone. The same thing happened tonight. I get my hopes up and think I’ll finally get to be spoiled and some attention, and the when I try and talk to him about how I’ve been feeling (like actual talking not fighting) he turns it into a fight and says “I’m treating you the way you deserve”. 

I feel like I do a lot for him and he doesn’t do much for me. I spoil him, I do his laundry when he comes over, I get him things to eat (I’m not a great cook) and drink. I give him a massage almost every night. When he wants sex and I don’t (I usually just give in because I know my sex drive is way down and I want him to be happy) I try not to fuss about it. I put things I want to do on hold for him. I’ve cleaned his house on occasion. I give him all of my attention. If he wants to talk I listen. If I mess up I legit apologize. I hardly ask for anything to my knowledge. Just for time and attention and for him to look away from his phone. I don’t even ask to go out anymore. 

Lately I have started saying no because I’m sick of how he treats me and I tell him that. 

TLDR; should I do more in my relationship and wait on him hand and foot when he won’t do the same for me anymore? I have tried to talk it out with him but he doesn’t talk he just argues and says “I treat you how you deserve to be treated”"
30,"My [F19] mom [F39] is upset at me because i dont tell her what’s happening in my life after she read my journal containing intimate stuff without my consent


I have always been kinda shy to tell my mom whats happening with me. I try to break free from that but in fear of them (parents) getting paranoid that i party/drink too much or basically worry about me too much i dont tell them stuff. 

Theyve been so proud that im “not that interested in getting a bf” and that i “have my priorities straight” even after sending me away to college to a faraway land. But yea a few months ago, my mom read my journal that contains shit like me having a bf that they dont know about and very private stuff like my bf and i exploring sexually like where we did shit, when...just the whole freakin thing. You can imagine my disbelief and just the utter sense of betrayal. And they disclosed that they too felt betrayed because they “thought our goals were the same”. Basically all the details of my sexual awakeninng and sexual adventures...they know all of it. My dad was more chill about it but my mom was crying and was really worried that i was gonna get pregnant despite me being on the pill, using a condom, and pullingg out. There were also stuff in my journal like me wanting to die, dreading about the future—ya know basic millenial problems.  But they spoke none of that.  

My parents are more open now. They told me they just feel slightly betrayed that i didnt tell them i dont have a bf. She told me she felt desperate that she didnt know whats going on with me so she resd my journal. Mom asked me if i wanted pills or if i wanted to visit an ob. Shes good tho. My dad’s kinda passive aggressive but he knows im growing up but im responsible enough. 

I just want my mom and i to be close and have a relationship where i can tell her everything. But somehow, her invading my private thoughts made me push up my walls higher. 

Tl;dr: i want my mom and i to have a close relationship but after she read my journal containing intimate moments with my bf i feel sorta betrayed and i became more closed off."
31,"My [17F] twin [17M] said he'd be happy once I was put of his life.


I have a twin brother. We live in the same house and will continue to do so until next year when we move to university and our parents move to Spain and sell the house.

Our parents are caring, loving and have taught us much, and we both have good relationships with them.

But what happened today shocked me immensely. 
I sat down talking to my brother today, because my dad told me that he had sensed that we both were getting more and more distant and thought maybe something was wrong. And he was correct. I have not been feeling the same kind of affection from my brother that I used to.

So when I told my brother what I had been feeling, he said it wouldn't make any sense to talk to me and solve the problem, because I wouldn't listen and I wouldn't change. I said no, I wanted to change. Whatever it is. I wanted to have that stable, loving relationship back that we had had before. And what he told me next just broke my heart.

He told me he didn't want to have me in his life and would be happy once I was gone.

And after that I just went to my room and started sobbing uncontrollably, I didn't even know what came over me in that moment. I was and I'm still so incredibly hurt from that comment and I don't even know why. It was something you'd say in a serious fight and forget about it later, but he just said it so calmly and in all seriousness, it just broke me. I don't know what to do, I don't want to lose him, because I love him, but apparently the feeling isn't mutual.

Please I need help. How can I save our relationship?

TL;DR: My brother suddenly told me he didn't want me in his life and I can't handle it emotionally."
32,"My best friend (18M) and I (19F) are both college burnouts; he has no tact whatsoever and it's driving me insane


I met my friend at freshman orientation last year. We were both former high school nerds looking to break free of that label in college. Unfortunately, because we had no life experience, neither of us took to ""freedom"" well. My vice was alcohol, his was promiscuous sex- over 50 partners in less than a year. (I should say here that he's gay and I was not involved in any way.) He frequently recounts these encounters in gory detail, sometimes in public settings where we can easily be overheard by strangers or other students. He's talked about sex (and by talked about I don't mean ""oh I just had sex with someone"", I mean ""he had a nice thick dick... I bet [my crush] has one too"") while visiting me at my work-study job, while we were on a public bus, while we were in a study lounge, and most bizarrely, he started to have phone sex with someone (including pulling down his pants) while we were in my dorm room- I was lying in bed and looking the other way, but I had a roommate and she could have walked in at any time. All along it made me uncomfortable (not just the sexual discussions, but the general lack of respect or care- for example, one of my work-study supervisors told him to be quiet one time and he flipped her off behind her back), but he doesn't react well to anyone telling him what to do, so my input would do nothing at best and piss him off at worst.

Our off-color/irresponsible behavior has made us a joke to some other people and made it near impossible to get out of the echo chamber of bad decisions (for example, we both got into the school newspaper and barely did anything to it, and we're a ""meme"" to the club sport we tried to join and ended up causing a major drama in- it seemed like we fucked up *everything* we touched). Unsurprisingly, our grades were horrible. I'm going back on academic probation, and he's taking some time off. Since I found out I was on probation, my tolerance for this kind of stuff has gone down exponentially. I thought that this would be a wake up call for him too, and it seemed like it was for a brief period of time, but now it seems like like he's sliding back into his old ways. A few days ago he slept with someone new, and called me at two in the morning to tell me about it (he's enlisted me to be his point of contact when he meets up with a new guy so I can call for help if I don't hear from him). He told me about this guy's dick in graphic detail- while, apparently, walking down the street. At one point he asked me if I also felt ""dirty"" after getting off (he knows that I watch porn and masturbate, which I've never told anyone else in my life, but that doesn't mean I want to discuss it), and I just said ""I don't know how to answer that"".

I don't even know how or if to address this, because I honestly don't know if this is just regular college-age stupidity that I'm overreacting to or if he has a problem. I don't want it to still be like this when school starts again, because I know it'll make it hard for me to change my own behavior improve my grades. How should I bring this up to him, and what can I do to improve myself? I'm cutting way down on drinking and partying (as in only going to extracurricular BYOs/parties that happen 1-2 times a semester and maybe out on Halloween), strategically chose my classes, got an online therapist, and downloaded some productivity apps (a planner, a widget that shows my upcoming assignments on my home screen, and one that restricts my access to time-wasting apps), but I want to do everything I can to ensure my success in the rest of my college career.

**TL;DR Best friend and I were total messes freshman year. His lack of a filter has always made me uncomfortable, but after suffering academic consequences of being messes, it's become unbearable. He seems slow to change. What do I do?**"
33,"My (F25) boyfriend (M30) does absolutely no chores at our house. Is it okay for me to stop doing chores and start being messy to teach him a lesson?


Tldr: boyfriend does no chores and I want to stop doing them too to teach him a lesson.

We've dated for 7 years and lived together 5 of them. Last year we had a long distance relationship due to work and we lived in separate towns. We moved back together this spring and since then my boyfriend hasn't done the dishes, laundry or cleaned in any way more than five times. I've told him to clean more and every time I bring it up, he says to ""stop nagging about it"". Last week I told him that I'm tired of being his mom and basically keeping this household together. Nothing has changed since last week and I'm running out of options. 

Is it okay for me to start being as messy as him? Start leaving the dishes around the house and doing laundry only for myself? Or leaving shoes in the middle of the hallway and stop taking the trash out?

We both have lived alone at some point in our lives so it's not like he moved out of his familyhouse straight to our house."
34,"My date for over a year (40m) tried to access my (31f) fb thinking I wouldn't find out.


Tl;dr at the bottom

This happened last week. I was at the gym and got a notification on my fb telling me someone tried to access it. I use a two step authentication for fb so there is no way to access it without having my phone.

I immediately knew it was him and when I asked him he instantly confessed. He told me he was having a moment of weakness and saw my fb with autofill on my computer and he ""just clicked it"".

I don't have anything to hide. What bothers me is that when presented with the opportunity he doesn't hesitate to do try and secretly go behind my back to access personal conversations thinking I wouldn't find out.

In a previous relationship I broke up with my significant other after I found out he had been accessing my phone and computer behind my back. Again - it's not that I have anything to hide and he never found anything - it's the act of distrust and projecting their insecurity on to me while going through my personal conversations behind my back.

My girlfriends share awkward things, secrets, rants and so on on there. Stuff meant for my eyes only. The thought of my grown up significant other going behind my back to read these things, hoping to what? Find out that their period pain is shitty this month? Is just infuriating.

I told him I needed some time alone.
How do I approach this? I am in love with this person and this is the first time (that I know of) that he has done anything like this to me.

Tl;dr: The guy I've been dating for a while tried to access my fb and failed. Fessed up and is sorry but I am pissed off."
35,"My cousin [32 F] wants my [27 F] mother's [44 F] help in court to not lose custody of her baby, but I think she deserves to lose it


I really don't know if this is the right place for this but I don't know where else to post. I'll give some backstory so you can see where I am coming from. I have this cousin, 32 female, that's been in and out of jail, she does pills, drinks, etc, has multiple DUI's, can't drive anymore because of her record, etc. A few years ago my mother wanted my sister and I to hang out with her, she went over to our house first since she said she wanted to use the restroom - we were going to go to the mall together - but instead she immediately goes through our medical cabinet and took some perceset that got assigned to my sister after her surgery. My sister did not even use all of it since she did not want to get addicted, but this woman, this pathetic excuse of a person stole the pills just to feed her addiction. 

I was younger then and in too much in shock to say something, but trust me things would be so different now if she tried to pull the same stunt. So the cousin decided to go off with some guy she met at work while her husband was allegedly being abusive towards her. She is still married to him and I don't think they filed for any form of divorce since the husband does not want to leave her and they are apparently broke. The cousin and her husband had an apartment together but since she moved out to live with her new boyfriend the husband could not afford the apartment by himself and is living elsewhere now, not sure where.  

So she got pregnant with allegedly her new boyfriend's baby. Things seemed fine at first and they seemed really happy before the baby was born. The baby was cute. This is all years later after the incident so we thought maybe, maybe she might have changed, esp. with the new baby. When the baby was born for some reason her new boyfriend kept sending her to the psychiatric hospital. We visited her once but I don't know what that was all about. Then apparently she threw a cell phone at him and he called the police on her. She was supposed to be drug tested and alcohol tested and to take some classes and the night before one of her classes she got drunk with one of her friends and decided to skip a test since she knew it would be positive. 

Her new boyfriend apparently had enough since he kicked her out and is apparently going to try to win sole custody. She said on the birth certificate it's blank on the father since she could not write her boyfriend's name since she was married to someone else. And apparently she slept with her husband at least once while also with her boyfriend so it might not even be her boyfriend's kid after all. 

So they are having some kind of hearing later in the week and she wants my mother to go and give them a character statement / show that she has family support since apparently her boyfriend says the cousin is broke and all alone and has no support and because of her record should have sole custody. I don't want my mom to go since my cousin clearly will never get better, not even having a baby and maybe losing that baby might change her, so nothing will. What do y'all think? Honestly I can't believe this is one of my own family members and not one of those mediocre lifetime shows my mom and I like to watch. 

TL;DR My female cousin who has made every bad choice humanly possible as shown above wants my mother's help in court to not lose custody of her new baby with a man that's not her husband. I don't want my mom pulled into all that bs. What do y'all think?"
36,"My (40F) friends (30sM/F) want me to get over my cheating ex (38M) because he's their friend and it's been two years. Am I being unreasonable?


Throwaway obviously.

&amp;#x200B;

**Background:**  Almost two years ago, I discovered that my now-ex had been having an affair with a woman ten years younger for about six months.  I confronted my husband and he admitted it immediately, told me the plan was to leave me after Christmas (about two months away), and he would now be moving in with his girlfriend ASAP.  You know those people who always say, ""if he cheats, I'm out?"" I was one of them.  And it turned out not to be true - I begged him to stay, work on us, stop seeing her and give me a chance, etc.  He coldly refused all of this, told me he loved me ""like a friend or aunt"" but our 15-year marriage was over, hoped we could be friends and ... goodbye.  We split all assets amicably (I got businesslike thinking the reality would hit him hard, now I just think I smoothed his way).  We self-filed the divorce petition (no kids) and I was divorced inside six months of finding out about his affair and plan to walk out on me.

&amp;#x200B;

He and his affair partner are now engaged (she was married too, what a prize right?) and their life is apparently better than anything he and I ever had.  His family NEVER made the effort to get along with me, but they plainly love HER.  His friends and family say that they've ""never seen him happier"" and it's like I never existed.  Even people who know what he has done - which is pretty much everyone - now congratulate him on his upcoming wedding and professional successes, etc.  Doesn't help that his new piece is also a standout in our field (shared by all three of us), receiving multiple awards and nominations which he brags about on social media.  Yes, I'm bitter about the fact that he wronged me, broke his vows to me, and appears to be none the worse for any of it.  I have tried to date but I'm not ready and no one interests me.

&amp;#x200B;

**Now to the point**.  Our friends Joe and Karin have a five year-old son, and we (ex and I) are his godparents.  He is very precious to me (I wanted kids but that didn't happen).  Ex and I both attended his #4 birthday party, which was right before our divorce was finalized, and kept things civil/even gave him a joint gift (and I admit, I thought at this time he might still change his mind and come back).  When his #5 party rolled around, I asked Joe and Karin to please leave me off the list if they were going to invite Ex, because I don't want to see him and can't handle it - it's too painful.  Joe and Karin invited me and not the ex, and I felt a small victory.  

&amp;#x200B;

Apparently this upset the ex because months and months later, Joe an Karin have sat me down for A Talk.  They told me that my godson still wants to see Ex, and they don't want to cut him out of their child's life.  Further, they're not interested in cutting him out as a friend (they never really did, but Karin didn't see him for a long time and his friendship with Joe was mostly over the phone/text, I know this from asking Joe and Karin about it).  They both told me they found his behavior reprehensible and acknowledged that he wronged me, etc.  But now they want to be friends with him again and are not going to work to keep him away from me.  This means I must now endure Ex's presence at life events for our godson... birthdays, upcoming graduations, his wedding? and more.  And I am warned that eventually godson will also meet Ex's now-fiancee, and she will be invited in the future, as well.  They have apparently made friends with this woman behind my back.  If I cannot understand this/behave myself, I don't have to come around and I will be sorely missed.

&amp;#x200B;

Am I crazy in thinking that I should not be made to endure any of this?  I can't lose this little boy from my life but I can't fathom being around Ex, or worse, Ex and the new piece.  How do I explain this to my friends?  Or am I being unreasonable because I'm so bitter?

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR: Ex husband cheated, left me for side piece, is going to marry her.  Mutual friends/parents of godson say it's been long enough that I should be able to get over it and they should be allowed to invited my ex to godson's events and we should all be civil."
37,"Girl at work [24-ishF] tried hitting on my [22F] husband [24M] as a power move. How do I go back to work now?


I recently graduating from the Paul Mitchell School, and I started working at a salon a few months ago.

I really like most of the girls I work with, but there is one girl in particular (Erin) who just does not like me. I really don’t understand what I did to her but she made it very clear she does not like me at all very early on.

It did culminate this last week when I put a lady in my seat who is apparently one of Erin’s regulars. I didn’t mean at all to steal business from her. She came in for a walk-in on Erin’s day off and I just said I could take her. Maybe I messed up but it was an accident.

Erin got all bent out of shape about it and it culminated with her chewing me out in the back room, at which point she told me she “could ruin my life.”

Today we had a social thing in the salon. They do this every six months or so where they close the shop and have a potluck and you can bring in SO’s and whatnot. It’s supposed to build up a family atmosphere I guess.

So I brought my husband in, we were having a good time. I intentionally avoided Erin but she found her way over to us.

She didn’t say a word to me but introduced herself to my husband. He tried to be polite but I could tell he was weirded out (and I had kept him up to date on my issues with this girl).

She got very flirty, and maybe it’s just my imagination but I swear she looked me in the eyes while she did it. She went as far as telling him if we “don’t work out” he should talk to her.

That prompted my husband to get pissed and tell her to leave him alone and we wound up leaving.


I am so pissed off by this! I don’t know what Erin’s fucking problem with me is, but that is over the line! 

I like my job and my salon, but it’s going to be pretty hard to look at Erin again without hauling off and breaking her nose.

Is there a solution? The other girls and the boss like me, or seem to, but Erin’s worked there for years and is in the OG club. Am I done at this salon? Can I work this out? 


**TL;DR**: Girl at work brazenly flirted with my husband as a power move. How do I possibly work next to her again?"
38,"My Parents [M48, F48] don't think my [F21] Boyfriend [M22] of 2 years is ambitious enough


This all happened last night. 


I live at home with both my parents. I joking around with them about getting an engagement ring from my boyfriend of over 2 years when my dad said ""Are you sure he's the one."" I said ""Yes of course!"" (But we are not planning on getting married for another 3 years). And then my dad said something along the lines of him being concerned that my boyfriend might not wanna help me do things around the house and that he doesn't want my future husband to just work 9 to 5 and come home and do nothing. My mom just agreed and said he doesn't seem very ambitious. I replied that he is not like that at all. I knew I would get upset so I just left and went upstairs. 


For context my boyfriend is almost done his first year of school for electrical engineering. He is in school full time right now and paying for it himself. He started school late because he did one semester of university right after high school, but didn't like the program. He then worked a bunch of labour jobs and saved $60,000 in the process. He worked 12 hours multiple times, and went up north to the oil rigs and worked night shift in those years off from school. He is very smart and wants to own an engineering firm/business one day.


My mistake was coming back downstairs because I felt all flustered and confused. I wanted to know exactly why they thought this about my boyfriend. My dad was no longer in the room so I asked my mom why she thought he wasnt ambitious. She said well he doesn't have a part time job (which he doesn't really need one but has been lately talking about working at Starbucks), he lives at home and his mom takes car of him (well he pays rent and she doesn't do any chores for him or anything), and he doesn't seem like he would help around the house (but he vacuums, does dishes &amp; laundry, and mows the lawn at his house, while also helping me with my car, editing my papers, ect.). Then I told her that he pays rent and she just got all mad at me and deflective. She started yelling at me how I don't help enough around here because she was doing dishes while I was talking to her. 


I told my boyfriend over text that I was so upset and that my parents think he won't help me around the house or work extra hours if needed. I felt like they were insinuating that he isnt good enough. I made clear that I don't think that but I know my boyfriend is upset my parents think this. It also makes it worse that his parents adore me. While mine just like him and think hes ""fine"". 


I don't know if it makes a difference but I am going into my 3rd year of business school and I work as a lifeguard/swim instructor once a week during the school year. I don't pay my parents rent, they pay for my school, and my mom is a stay at home mom who does my laundry and cooks supper almost every night for our family. 


How do I handle my parents and what do I do to make my boyfriend feel better?


TL;DR: Parents dont think my boyfriend is ambitious enough. I don't think this is true but I am upset and so is my boyfriend. How do I fix this situation?"
39,"My (18f) boyfriend (22m) assaulted me. I want to break up with him but everyone in my life is telling me not to because it's a mistake. I need advice


This is my first time ever making a post here and I'm on my phone so sorry for any mistakes. To make a long story short, we met when I was in 6th grade and he was in 8th. We started dating when I was in 8th grade (I was 13, he was 17 and already a sophomore in high school. My parents were ok with it so we have been together for 5 years now) we started officially living together when I turned 18 and we've only been living together for a couple of months now. 
so my issue is, I take medication for several things. I have really bad sleep problems and take heavy medication for it, plus medication to help keep my blood pressure lower and help with night terrors. Along with medication for anxiety and depression. It's a lot. My boyfriend knows this. There have been several times where he's woken me up by trying to start having sex with me. He's always stopped when I've asked him to but he gets moody and upset the next day when he doesn't get what he wants. 

Yesterday, I woke up and I just felt gross. I don't want to go into full details but I had what I could only guess was semen stuck between my thighs. I can't explain it but I just felt nasty and really sore down there. I got up and showered like I normally do and just could not shake the feeling of feeling yucky all day. I went to work like normal and when I got back to our apartment, I straight up asked him ""did you have sex with me while I was asleep?""

His answer: ""yeah you were asleep I figured you wouldn't mind""

Me: ""I'm not ok with that. why didn't you wake me up?""

He just shrugged and said he didn't think I would csre and that I ""looked sexy"" sleeping and it was ""something he wanted to do"" ever since we started dating/sleeping together

Now I'm scared to take my medicine tonight. What if he keeps doing it even after I said I wasn't ok with this? I never told him this was something I wanted to do. I have no interest in having sex when I'm asleep because I definitely can't enjoy it when I'm dead to the world.


This isn't the first issue we've had but it's really the biggest one so far. I feel disrespected and really mad over it. I told one of my friends what happened and what should I do and she said I should think of it as a compliment because he apparently couldn't help himself?? I don't get that line of thinking. I even called my mom and didn't go into full details but gave her a short story of what happened and her response was ""He's a man. So what? He has urges that he can't control"" and called him a nice guy and I shouldn't ""make a mistake""

I don't know what I'm doing. I've never been in a relationship before this. I don't know if this is really ok and if I'm overreacting or not. Someone tell me what they would do in this situation. 


*TL;DR:** Boyfriend did things to me while I was asleep that I'm not comfortable with. Both my mom and a friend say I'm making a mistake if I break up with him. I really don't know what to do."
40,"I [20F] had a heart-to-heart conversation with my dad [48M] last week, then I heard him calling me names over the phone when he was talking to my mom [45F] about our coversation


My parents have been fighting over an issue for 4 months now. This issue concerns my dad's parents and my mom who never got along. In between, my dad took a job in a different state and moved away from us. I try to be as objective as possible and take neither side, however, this fight has caused me a lot of anxiety and stress.

I have a good father. I am his only child and I know he dearly loves me. He is very well educated and made good enough money to put me through the best schools and provide a comfortable life for us. However, I have always had issues with my father since childhood. He has been verbally abusive to my mom and me. My mom always tells me the only reason he stayed with him is because of me.

My parents always fought so it is not a new thing for me, but it has never been this big. I am preparing myself for graduating next year and going to law school and this fight has caused me a lot of stress. My mom comes home from work and all she talks about is about this drama. She has become very unhappy and sad yet, I can't do anything about it. I know that this drama is mainly my dad's fault, but he is very stubborn and doesn't listen to anyone. He yells as soon as I bring anything up. He just doesn't listen to anyone.  

A week ago, I called my dad and I told him that I am sick and tired of this crap. I asked him to end this drama and I poured my heart out, telling him how much I have struggled in the past couple of months because of this. I didn't judge him or took anyone's side. Yet, he yelled at me, I yelled at him, I cried over the phone for him, he cried for me, and I begged him to stop this. We talked for 3 hours and he promised me that he will call my mom, and fix this situation because he doesn't wanna see me distressed. I was happy that I finally made some progress to end this.

Tonight, I heard my mom yelling over the phone. I went to check what is going on, and she put it on speaker. It was my dad. As soon as she put him on, he mentioned my name. He called me ""worthless"" and ""childish"" and some other names which are not appropriate to mention here (he didn't know I was listening). He was telling my mom about our heart-to-heart conversation and the fact that how little he thinks of me after that. 

I was shocked. I could not believe how mean he could be towards me.  All my life, I worked so hard to make him proud; I went to one of the top universities in the world with amazing grades, have always been obedient and never did anything wrong in my life, yet, he said that he doesn't regard me ""as his own anymore"". I am very heartbroken and angry right now and don't know how to react. 

&amp;#x200B;

tl;dr:  My parents have been fighting over an issue for 4 months now. I had a heart-to-heart conversation with my dad \[48M\] last week, then I heard him calling me names over the phone when he was talking to my mom about our conversation."
41,"I (27F) can’t deal with my boyfriend’s (27M) family low hygiene standards anymore


I was actually writing a post about a whole other issue but it got too long and honestly this is the one I’m most ashamed about because I don’t want to tell any of our friends because I don’t want to embarrass him. Also, sorry for any typos, I wrote it on a word document while I was deciding about posting it and it autocorrects to spanish.

So, we’ve been together for more that 6 years. When we started dating, he lived with his parents and I shared a place with some roomates, and he spent most of the time at my house. He was a total disaster. He didn’t even know how to sweep. I had to remind him to wash his hands constantly. He really needed to experience living alone for some time, and it showed. I got diagnosed with a rare autoimmune disease shortly after we started dating, and my health got progressively worse so 4 years later I had to move back to my parents house, in another city, while I got used to it/got better, so we both still live with our parents (not a weird thing in my country). So now, when we go visit, we stay in each other’s houses, and it’s a nightmare.

His house is filthy. His dad and his brother don’t give and absolute fuck about the trash they leave around.  I remember seeing a piece of prawn sticked to the tablecloth for DAYS, and when I asked him, you know, trying to be discreet, how often they changed and washed the tablecloth he said: “I don’t think we’ve ever washed it since we got it”. I had to convince him to buy a plastic one so we could at least clean it with a wet rag. When his brother had to have surgery (phimosis), he would leave blood all over the floor and counters everytime he changed his bandages, and then leave the bloody bandages there (his brother is in his 20s). They would also leave used cotton swabs everywhere in the bathroom, dirty smelly socks on the sofa. They overload the dishwasher so much that everything comes out dirty and sticky. I’ll be using a “clean” spoon and it would taste like old greasy food.

But the worst thing is the fridge. That goddamn fridge smells like there’s a dead body inside. Here’s the thing: I have an overactive sense of smell, which is a nightmare for me, and a blessing for everybody else: I can smell food that’s going bad before it looks like it, and I detected a couple of fires in my neighbour’s houses before they could even realized it (my dad showed up with a fire extinguisher saying “let me in, please, your house is on fire”). So maybe I’m overreacting a little bit. But it’s so bad. Years ago I could stand being in the kitchen while the fridge was open, now I can even be near it when it’s closed. And that smell gets EVERYWHERE. You want some cold water? It tastes like that. Some butter? Also tastes like that. Some cheese? Same. Even the plastic bags they store near the fridge smell like that. 

The worst thing is, he says it smells like food. Let me tell you, if a restaurant smelled like that I would call for an inspection. I would call for a priest, that smell comes straight from hell. It’s so disgusting, and I don’t even know what it is, I’ve never smelled anything like that, and I’ve spent a lot of time in a microbiology lab.

And I could kind of deal with all of these if it didn’t make me literally sick. I had a flare up of my autoimmune disease everytime I visited them. At first I thought it had to do with stress, but then I saw his father pick up a toast from their dirty ass floor, look at it like he was deciding to eat it, and then PUT IT BACK ON THE BAG. And nobody said ANYTHING. I talked to my boyfriend, he said that had to be a one time thing, but since then I just eat take out or things that we buy and are still sealed. I still get sick, but not that often and not that bad.

Now, I know you’ll probably say to not stay at their house, but we can’t afford a hotel or Airbnb and I try to go there as little as I can, but still have to do it from time to time (his birthday, for example). And my problem is that, yeah, he tries to accomodate me, but he is so dismissive. He says the fridge smell is normal. He says his house is clean, that it’s just his dad and his brother. He says I’m getting sick for other reasons. And he says they are used to it and it’s not wrong. And I’m so scared of the idea of moving together. I’m immunocompromised, I catch everything, and I can’t afford getting sick so many times. Cortisone is not a harmless treatment, immunosuppresants either. And the thing is, he is a biologist. He did many microbiology courses, and still gets surprised when I got sick because he forgot to store some burgers in the freezer and let them over the counter for a whole ass day and then gave them to me (I didn’t know). 

I just can’t understand it. I can’t live like that, I don’t have the patience to keep teaching him the same things over and over again. If we ever have children, I don’t want to let them visit such a filthy house. Funny thing, his mother has been working as a cleaner for years.

I don’t know what to do. I don’t know if I’m overreacting. I don’t know how to make him realized that this is not normal, or healthy, just because he’s used to it. And I get that it’s not my house and I’m trying my best to not show how repulsed I am, but everytime I go to his house we have this conversation because he would say: “I’ve clean the whole house!” and it looks and smells the same. I just don’t know if I can deal with this anymore, and I need some advice because if this relationship ends I don't want it to be because a nasty ass fridge. Thank you.

TLDR: My boyfriend's house is filthy and I can't take it anymore. I don't know if he's going to be able to improve those hygiene standards when he gets out of that house and I need it for health reasons (and also because it's nasty)."
42,"Advice please. Husband wants me to give up regular job for high stress job with long hours.


Hello! This is my first time posting on Reddit so please be gentle...

My husband and I are both 40 and have been married for 13 yrs with two little ones.  In an ideal world we’d both stay in our careers long term.

As things stand, my husband works in a lab almost 1.5 hours away from our current house and he gets up at 5:30 AM to get to work so that he can leave earlier and get home by a decent time.  I have an amazing 8-5 job as a pulmonary attending (minimal critical care). I have time to care for both children and drop them off at daycare before leaving for work and my husband picks them up in the afternoon.

I have been under a lot of pressure from both his family and my family to move closer to where he works.  When I look into jobs near his lab most are pulmonary and critical care jobs that are standard 7AM-7 PM shifts or vise versa 7PM-7AM (1 week on, 1 week off).  Working in a MICU is also highly stressful and frankly some nights I don’t sleep at all due to the acuity of patient care.  Most night I get fragmented sleep with 2-3 hours here or there between pages.  I’m also making a little more than double his salary but frankly, I don’t care about my salary so much as having a decent quality of life and being able to spend time with the children. As people say back in school, what’s the point of having a big house if you can’t live in it? Incidentally we have 1.5k sq ft colonial built in the 1940s and really do need a bigger house the accommodate everyone.

My husband and both our families would like me to move.  He often brings up his commute time during family gatherings and have even begun looking up job opportunities and forwarding them to me.  I love my husband very much and am concerned for his safety, but when I asked him why he cannot move instead he says that as a Princeton graduate he can “accomplish more” at his current lab than anywhere else.  As far as I know he has made no effort to explore other job opportunities because he wants to retire at his current position. 

So in summary if I move I will have to resume a highly stressful job with long hours, poor to sometimes no sleep, and a high burnout rate(48 % per 2018 Medscape survey but lower than some other medical specialities) . The advantage would be that we can probably get a bigger house without spending a ton since the area is more rural.  If my husband moves, he may not accomplish as much academically as he would like but at least it will still be a 9-5 job. In fact if he moved we can both have stable 9-5 and family friendly jobs.  I’ve told him it’s highly unlikely that any new job for him will require an urgent analysis at 3AM whereas that’s exactly what I I will be doing if I gave up my job instead.

Anyways, am I being unreasonable by not finding another job?  Should I just take the plunge, get a new job, sell the house and move closer to his employer?  Or should we move so that I drive 30 min and he 1 hr for work instead with me keeping my job?  Everyone seems to prioritize his career over BOTH of us having decent job hours or some semblance of quality of life.  If he moved closer to where I am working we can potentially be set for years (assuming it works for him), but considering that he refuses to change jobs and said that he’d rather drive than switch jobs I feel enormous pressure to switch instead.  

We have a nice house in a safe community, excellent schools, and I like my current job very much.  I don’t want to switch jobs, hate the stress and the hours, and end up resenting him for making me move in the first place but I feel enormous guilty seeing him drive so far every day.  I keep thinking that if only he’s accept “accomplishing less” and get at 9-5 near me then we’d be set.  I know it’s not nearly that simple but any advice or suggestions would be greatly appreciated.

tl:dr   My husband refuses to consider a job switch and would prefer that I give up my job to take on a highly stressful and physically demanding job instead."
43,"My (27 F) Fiancé (32 M) peed on me during an argument....


Hello reddit, using a throwaway for obvious reasons. Not really sure what I should do in this situation.

My fiancé and I have lived together for about 5 years, we met 7 years ago and have been dating around 6 years total. Tonight we were drinking wine and getting it to an argument about how I felt disrespected when he made a joke about me at the bar. He kept belittling me and telling me to take a joke better and not be so sensitive.

This escalated (too long to tell specifics) I was yelling at him, he was yelling at me....then all of a sudden he pulled out his penis and began peeing on me. I tried to run away but he wouldn’t stop. He got it on my face, my shirt, my back.....he continued to yell at me. I just left his house.....we don’t fight often so I’m not exactly sure how to proceed. I just spent a decent chuck of money on a hotel room for tonight.

TLDR: fiancé and I had a drunk argument that needed in him peeing on me maliciously"
44,"I (23M) am starting to get a little worried about how my wife (24F) is with my best friend (24M)


I'll try and give as much details as possible and I do want to say upfront that I really do trust my wife and haven't said a word to her about any of this because of that. It is getting increasingly worrisome once one of my wife's friends pointed it out to me.

Some backstory here, I have been married to my wife for a little over a year and together for 3 years. She is incredible and we have had practically 0 relationship issues.

My best friend has been my best friend since I was two years old. We are inseparable and extremely close. He just graduated college and moved back to our town and my wife helped him out by getting him a job at her work (Insurance Company) as a financial adviser. They have never been friends before this and just talked because I'm obviously very close with both of them so they would interact while I was with both of them.

He got the job 4 months ago. Since the day he started the following things have started happening.

1. They text all the time. I see it at a glance but never really go through them, but they never once texted before. It isn't that weird considering they work together now but the volume is a lot.
2. He doesn't respond to me anymore. If I message him on Facebook or text him, he reads it and doesn't respond or if he does its 3-4 days later and he says he has just been really busy.
3. He insists on picking my wife up for their weekly office meetings and telling her how cool they look arriving in his sports car.
4. I get home from work and he has been there multiple times. Nothing weird happening, but he is just there watching TV and hanging out with her or doing whatever. He acts normal when I come in and acts like my buddy.
5. He gets licences to start working effectively and he doesn't tell me he passed his tests at all and he goes to dinner with my wife to celebrate. No invitation for me and I found out like 2 weeks later.
6. They go to Seattle every year for a big work conference and are now going together. They aren't sharing a room together but have made it clear they will be spending the whole time together and are going to an amusement park and stuff just them.
7. He made my wife switch gyms to go to his and they go nearly every day when before she went 2-3 times a week
8. He comments on all her pictures now going cuuuuuutttteeeeeee or something like that.

Am I insane? There are other small stuff I don't need to list out like how they talk sometimes. Am I being paranoid here? I haven't said a word to either of them except one quick snide comment to my wife as sort of a joke and she just brushed it off saying ""Oh yeah its cause we work together and you guys are best friends anyways"".

As I said before my wife's best friend pointed this out to me when I was only barely paying attention to it before at a house party we had last week and I started to realize it a little more.

A lot of it could be my insecurity. I'm not afraid to admit he is better looking than me and in really good shape. He has said before (like guys do sometimes) when we got together that my girlfriend was hot.

What do I do here? Any advice would be great.

TLDR: Wife is getting really close with my best friend after she got him a job when they had no previous relationship beforehand and it has me worried."
45,"I (F33) didn’t do a favour for my husband (M36) and he is giving me silent treatment and locked me out of parts of the house. How should I approach this?


Hi.

So my husband has a female friend he plays music with that I have been really uncomfortable with because she touches him (rubbed his belly and he downplayed it and said it was a joke and I was being OTT), they’ve been calling each other for hours without me knowing recently while he told me they “rarely talked” and I just don’t have a good feeling about her for countless incidents where I perceive she’s trying to lord herself over me.

As it became too much after I realised they’d been spending hours on the phone (again while he told me they rarely talked) I asked him to cease personal contact with her last week. He’s been extremely distant and annoyed since then and on the weekend, he was away until Sunday on a weekend tour.  When he got back in Sunday he had to go straight to a show with this girl somewhere else from the airport. 

On Thursday we made a suggestion I MAY pick him up Sunday and drive him to his show he had with this girl - however no actual plans were made and he also suggested he may just borrow a guitar from a friend he was touring with and go to the gig himself as that was an option. At no point did we make any firm plans and he indicated he had other options. 

He left Friday for his weekend shows but was still grumpy about this girl and me wanting him to cease personal contact (i indicated I’m still okay for him to work with her but not the long personal phone calls and her ignoring me then texting him early morning or late at night, or doing free studio work for her). He spent the whole weekend giving me silent treatment and then sent a series of sarcastic and grating texts Saturday before ignoring me again. No good mornings or good nights - just Straight out silent treatment and rude messages. I had a pretty bad weekend because when he ignores me I find i feel really down.  

On Sunday he finally sent a message at 1am saying “I’m guessing our plans not going ahead” then another text hours before the show with the girl I don’t like after he flew in asking if I was driving his stuff to her for him or whether he needed to look into another option. As he mentioned he could have borrowed a guitar I said I didn’t want to help him on account of not wanting to see this girl but also that he had given me silent treatment all weekend and I was not cool to drop everything and help him after this. I’ve never set a boundary like this and it was really hard. 

He did not respond and went back into silent treatment but then I panicked and called the friend he was supposed to borrow the guitar off to ask if he had done so or whether I needed to drop his stuff.  His friend said he had declined the offer he was made for the guitar and for a ride, and that he called the girl to say he was cancelling the work with her. His friend said he appeared completely fine with this.

Long story short, my husband got home Sunday and ignored me. We have two sections of our home and he came, locked himself downstairs and then sent me a text saying this:

I am angry about you embarrassing me and leaving me stranded today, also the money that I need that I have now lost. If I knew this was happening I would have at least made other choices. I guess you got to make your point. Thanks for teaching me a lesson. I will remember this. Do not come near me. I have sorted myself downstairs and I don’t want to see you or talk to you. I will not be sending any messages after this. Leave me alone.”

I then woke up and he had deadlocked multiple parts of the house as well as removed keys from the house from my key ring so I have no access to do anything like laundry. He has locked me out of the house before but this has now been ongoing Since Sunday and I haven’t seen him with the exception of him coming upstairs briefly yesterday and nearly barging me - then not saying hi and telling me to get out of the bathroom. 

I’m annoyed because 
-there was no firm plans and I had no idea based on his behaviour all weekend he wanted me to drive his things still. 
-he enacted silent treatment all weekend and was rude and then suddenly expected me to drop everything and transport him to a gig with a girl I really don’t like 
-he told me he had other options and his friend offered him equipment and a ride which he declined
-he is blaming me for something that is not my responsibility 
-at no point did he tell me he’d have to cancel the gig with the girl if I didn’t help me but rather didn’t respond to me saying I dint want to help.

How should I react to this and what should I do? Do I need to be apologising here?  At this point he hasn’t talked to me for ages, has locked me out of part of the house and removed my keys and has told me I’m not allowed to talk to him.

He’s done this before but not this long and I’m really feeling upset and not coping. Any thoughts or advice appreciated. 

TLDR; husband has locked me out of house and is giving silent treatment because I didn’t want to do him a favour after he was rude all weekend to me."
46,"Wife wants me to ask my sister (26F) if she could not sleep in the same room as her fiancee (27M) while we're staying here because he has the flu.


My wife and I are visiting family in Australia, and we're staying with my sister for the next week before we go to see my parents. It's winter here in Australia and the flu is making its way around. My sister's boyfriend currently has the flu. You can tell he's sick as a dog and his asthma doesn't help things. My sister has been letting him rests but checks if he needs anything. She goes to bed pretty early so he's not alone and they watch TV. 

My wife has this problem with germs and she just can't deal with people being sick. She wants me to ask to my sister if she could sleep in a seperate room to her fiance while he's sick. I know, it's insane, but she insists that she doesn't want to get sick while we're here. We had a whole argument about it today and she's pouting in our room. 

TL;DR: Wife wants me to do something rude and is upset because I don't want to do it, and is throwing a tantrum."
47,"Everyone is mad at me [M/21] because I won't let my recovering addict auntie [F/45] use my car after she totaled the last one I had


When I was a senior in high school I bought an 1986 Buick Grand National GNX, which is a car that I had been obsessed with since I was 3 years old. I had the car for about 18 months and my auntie asked me if she could use it to run some errands while I was at college during the day. I thought that meant that she wanted to go to the Barton Creek Mall or the outlets in Round Rock, but apparently what she actually meant was that she wanted to go to the liquor store and to a drug dealer. She got into a really bad accident that day, by God's grace all she got was a broken arm but the car was mangled so badly that the cops were shocked that she wasn't dead. She got a DWI and went to rehab for 60 days, got out and relapsed again within a month, this time we sent her to the Betty Ford Clinic in California where she was for over 5 months, relapsed again and went back there for another 6 months. She just got back home a couple weeks ago.

In the meantime I bought another classic car, a 1966 Mustang, because that's just my thing. Since she's been back she has been asking to use my car, I told her no but I offered to drive her wherever she needs to go because these days I only have about 7 hours of classes a week, but she is adamant about her taking the car by herself. She told my parents I said no to her and they came down on me for ""treating my auntie like an untrustworthy junkie after all of her hard work"", and that isn't the case, I know she has worked hard but I also know addiction is a very strong thing that can make a person throw everything away, and frankly I'm suspicious that she is so adamant about being alone just to ""run errands"". I don't want her to die, I also don't want my car which I love to get destroyed. When I told my parents that they should lend her one of their cars instead, they said that's ridiculous because my daddy needs to go to work and my mama needs to go to the supermarket, the hairdresser, tennis lessons, drop off and pick up my brothers etc. and when I suggested that she take an Uber to where she needed to go, they all scoffed and my mama started talking about that girl in South Carolina who was murdered by her Uber driver, when I said that she was a college student taking a ride at 2am and not a 45 year old woman out during the day she wouldn't hear it. The only person who agrees with me is her husband, my uncle by marriage, who said that he also offered to drive her around but she wouldn't have it and is angry because he said that he wouldn't buy her a car of her own until she had a year clean out of rehab, which I think is fair.


I love my auntie, I don't want her to feel badly and I am happy to take her where she needs to go but giving her my keys is a risk too far for me right now. 


**TLDR:** Everyone is angry because I won't let my recovering addict auntie drive my car"
48,"I (m29) stay stressed out and my (f30)wife thinks the world revolves around her to the point where I have no one to talk to.


TL;DR I have marriage issues that I have no one to talk to about and its starting to drive me crazy. I love myself as a person and dont feel like harming myself but I do think I will end up in a crazy hospital.

This is going to be a long one because there is a lot on my chest I need to get out.

My wife is a stay at home mother and I work full time at a stay at home job making above average money for the city and state we live in but not enough for two kids(80k). I feel like with how my life is situated right now that I have literally every single responsibility that you could put on someone and my wifes sole responsibility is the kids from 9 to 5. My wife was raised with a silver spoon in her mouth and needs everything done for her(examples: oh man this firestick wont come on can you fix it? Come and unplug the power cable and plug it back in.(this is all while still working as well)). I take care of all the money and any time I have ever brought up that we need to stop spending as much, we get into a huge argument leading to her talking about her anxiety and depression cant handle it which I TRY to be as careful as I can because I know that stuff is a serious issue but truly its an easy out of any adult responsibility.

This is a separate rant on top of the last sentence. I figuered up the amount of money we were spending in a months time on LITERALLY just food be it grocery store or out to eat and it was 2300 a month....... I get paid only about 4300 dollars a month. Our bills that are every month add up to 2500 dollars so that alone is over how much I get paid. Which doesnt even add the cost of our medical bills which is another rant I have coming up.

I feel like all the stress I have is effecting my mental health severely. Im not currently suicidal as I am actually happy with my self which is extremely hard to explain but I hate my current situation. Everyone that knows me says I used to be this outgoing person that would give the best hugs and always be smiling but now I seem miserable and I really feel like I am. 

One of the current things that is making me actually write this is that my wife is sick and we found that she has something dealing with motion sickness issues but all the time(trying to be least descriptive as I can just in case she were to see this). Its not a serious issue but its also not something I'd say id take for granted that she doesnt feel like shit. The only problem is that my wife is so useless outside of being sick that when shes sick its 10x worse to the point where im taking care of the kids while working and doing all the house work while she lays around and reminds me every 30 mins how bad she feels. This happens almost monthly where she has some sort of sickness that disables her from her normal responsibilities. Not to mention going back to our money issues that she doesnt have to worry about, these doctor visits are so much that ive literally HAD to let 3 or 4 of them just go against our credit as there would be no way for me to pay them 10 dollars here and 10 dollars there because theres 0 dollars in my account.

I feel like I cant breathe sometimes like this isnt even all of the problems that we have. I dread coming down stairs from work to be around her and she likes to bring up in arguments that I dont want to spend time with my family and would rather be playing video games(SHE FUCKING DESPISES VIDEO GAMES). When in reality my kids mean more to me then life it self and I could give anything in the world for them I just hate being around her. Even when playing with my kids she tries to control the way that I play with them. Like she belittles me for not wanting to play barbies with them like I am a bad father. Which that was because I grew so poor that I never had toys so I had to go play outside not sit inside up my moms butt and play with her all day.

I have 1000 more things but literally typing all this out kind of is bumming me out when I should relaxing in this bathtub because my kids are asleep and my work is done for the day."
49,"How do I (29F) get through to my boyfriend (36M) that his demands for sex are going to destroy our relationship?


I’m (29F) at my wits end with my boyfriend (36M). We’ve been together a year and a half and living together since the beginning of this year.

His sex drive is insatiable. He wants to have sex every day. When he doesn’t, after 2-3 days he’ll pout and give me the guilt-trippy silent treatment and act like a puppy who’s been kicked. My libido is lower than it’s been in the past because I’m on Lexapro, but more so lately because I find his whiny nagging and groping at me to be such a turnoff. I can’t get out of the shower and walk to our bedroom in a towel without him having to aggressively sexualize it. Changing clothes, putting on lotion, wearing shorts, literally anything I try to do even vaguely sexual and I feel like I’m being catcalled in my own home. A few weeks ago I had a serious depressive episode and was naked in bed because I literally did not have the energy to get up to put on pajamas, and he had to sexualize the moment despite knowing the state I was in. He has no clue what’s appropriate and what’s not and acts like he’s the one being put out.


The weird part about the situation is that I’ve been in the exact same position as him before and it, along with other things, ended my 5-year marriage. So to an extent I understand his frustration, but if anything it makes me even more irritated with him because my ex would go months without initiating sex, and even with me initiating it was 2-3 times a month maximum. My boyfriend and I have sex 2-3 times a WEEK and he treats me like I’m a terrible frigid partner. He compares me to his ex-wife if 12 years who wanted to have sex with him whenever he wanted it and couldn’t get enough. It makes me want to beat my head against the wall.

How do I get through to him? We’ve talked and talked and talked and it gets us nowhere, he refuses to even consider that he’s unreasonable. He truly believes with all his heart that I’m the one with the problem here. Outside of this he’s the perfect partner, sweet and loving and supportive. But this is going to break us if we don’t get it sorted.

**tl;dr:** my boyfriend of a year and a half has an insatiable libido and we’re on a crash course towards a breakup if we can’t get on the same page. How can I get this through to him?"
50,"My friends made fun of me because of my skin color, again ..


My friends and I are medical interns and this happened today in-between morning rounds. I’ll try my best to translate to English.

Three of my friends were talking and cracking jokes, and I was standing opposite them leaning on the wall, on my phone. Two of them I’ve known for YEARS (let’s call them A and F) and the third one (M) we met a few weeks ago.

For context: I live in the middle-east, and the majority of people here have copper/olive colored skin. I am biracial, my dad is middle-eastern and my mom is Syrian (white skin tone). I am white like my mother.

Anyway, back to today

So they were talking, laughing when suddenly (A) looked up at me and said, “look at that (racial word)”. The word is in Arabic and it’s an offensive racial term against Syrians.

They all laughed.

It was the first time I hear him say this word.

(F) then proceeded to make fun of my hair, comparing it to the hair of people of an another Arab country (as if it was an insult), again all 3 laughed. I was shocked, I didn’t say anything. I just walked away and stood in a corner.

My friends always made fun of my skin color, comparing me to a white wall, my lab coat, a ghost, so it’s not the first time they target me.

The hair thing I could take but the racial slur hit really deep. I’ve been called that word so many times in school. I was cussed at, called names, shoved aside, spit on, just because of my skin color. And hearing this word today brought back so many bad memories.

(A) &amp; (M) realized something was wrong because my mood instantly flipped. (A) grabbed my arm to pull me aside to talk to me but I jerked it away and told him to leave me alone. (M) came up and started patting my shoulder telling me to “wake up” because I’m usually this bubbly smiley person. I moved away from him and stood alone.

The rest of the day I completely ignored all three. A couple of hours later (A) pulled me to the side again and started apologizing. I admit I’m not perfect, but all my friends (including A) know I’m sensitive about this subject, so hearing him apologize felt empty. Especially when he said “I have many friends who are” then trailed off. He meant to say “I have many friends who are Syrian”. I just walked away after hearing that.

I need advice you guys. Am I overreacting ?? What should I do?

TL;DR :

Friend called me a racial slur (against Syrians) and other friends proceeded to laugh at me. I was bullied in school because of my skin color and this word brought back so many bad memories."
51,"My dad (52M) wanted to open a credit card in my (18M) name, and he’s mad that I didn’t let him...


Basically we are remodeling my dads house and he wanted to open a Costco card in my name to buy a new couch, because he currently isn’t able to purchase it otherwise. I’ve lived with my dad for 18 years, and I’ve seen first hand how he is irresponsible with money. He’s opened and closed countless credit cards, in his name, his brothers, my moms, etc. and his been in debt most of his life. So me, wanting to protect myself, said I didn’t want him to open a card in my name, even though he said he’d pay it off quickly. He took it super offensively and started screaming at me at so many things, that I’m betraying him and that he’s paid for me all my life, he raised me and he’s done everything for me. Also, I owe him some money because I got into a car accident (which I am paying back slowly), and he used that against me as if I owe it to him to let him open a card in my name. It obviously gave him a huge blow to his ego. From my point of view I understand why he would be offended, but I’m just trying to protect myself. If I let him open this card, it will just encourage him to open more and more cards under my name, and eventually it will get out if control. My dad says he would never do anything to ruin my life or credit, but to be honest I just don’t trust him. He did it to his brother and wife, why wouldn’t he do it to me?  I think owing him money and opening a card in my name are two totally different things. Me owing him money doesn’t give him the right to open things in my name. I will pay him back the money as I am doing over time, without risking anyone’s future. I thought I was doing the right thing but from his reaction I feel really bad about it, like I was wrong to do that to him. As he was angry and yelling he told me “you’re on your own now, I’m not paying for shit anymore.”

I just personally feel this wasn’t the right way for him to go about the situation and he has no right to open things in my name regardless of what he’s done for me. If I owe you money I’ll pay it back, that’s it. My dad has always been sort of a narcissist and had a sense of entitlement. There’s been family problems in my house since I was a little kid and I don’t want this to affect me anymore. I just felt like I was making the right decision but now he’s making me feel guilty for it. How do I respond to him when he’s yelling at me like this? Was I wrong to make the choice I made?


**tl;dr** my dad is mad that I wouldn’t let him open a credit card in my name."
52,"I (F28) dont know if I'm being naive or if my (m28) husband is cheating on me


I'm not sure if my husband has cheated on me/is cheating on me and just want some advice. There are two situations that occurred that make me suspicious, but he has vehemently denied. I dont know if itll be so obvious to everyone else and I'm just being naive so please be honest (but nice if possible because I am already very torn up). We have been married for 5 years and honestly I just couldnt picture him doing this, but I'm sure this is what everyone says who was cheated on :( This is long so I TRULY appreciate anyone who reads through and offers insight. 


Situation One: 
A while ago, I logged into his email and saw that he had an email notification from tumblr. I opened it and saw that the email notification was a woman responding to a message and saying that she wasnt interested. So what it looked like was HE sent some random woman on tumblr a message hitting on her and she responded that she wasnt interested. 


I was at work when I saw this and called him right away. He denied having a tumblr account and said he had no idea what that was about. I was so angry that he started crying because he said he had no way to prove he didnt send anyone a message over tumblr and he knew what it looked like to me and had no idea how to prove it wasnt him. He said maybe somebody typed in their email address wrong and was accidentally using his email for their tumblr account. 


A while later, I looked through his Google playlist and it showed that he downloaded tumblr on his phone a month before I saw that email. I confronted him and he admitted that he downloaded the app, but said he never created an account and just used it to browse memes and again denied that he ever sent that message.


Situation Two: 
He left on a work trip recently and one night he was drunk and called his friend, let's call him Alex, and told Alex that a woman was trying to show him her boobs or he was trying to see a woman's boobs. Alex told his wife about this phone call and his wife messaged me and told me. 


I asked him a very direct line of questioning after I found this out, (ie have you been out drinking on your work trip? Have you gotten drunk since you've been there? Have you ever called a friend while drunk in your life? Have you asked anyone to see their boobs/have they asked you Etc). He answered NO to all of these. Two hours later he called me back and said he had something to confess. He said he was volunteering at a concert with his coworkers and was selling beer at the concession stand and a woman offered to flash him for free beer.


Now I suppose this is believable, but why lie about being drunk and why call me two hours later and not tell me this right away, especially if it was so innocent. I talked to him the night of the concert when he was wrapping up and he didnt mention anything to me about that. He said he freaked out when I asked those questions because he had no clue how I would know about any of that which is why he got off the phone and called back two hours later. 


So I dont know what to make of any of this. He sounds so believable but I just have this voice in the back of my head telling me I'm being stupid and naive for believing him and that to anyone else itd be so obvious. I'm heartbroken just thinking about it and dont know what to make of it. I have always trusted him but now I am questioning. I dont want to be with someone who cheats on me, but I dont know if he is or not. Any advice or insight would be helpful and very appreciated. 


Tl;dr two situations make me question whether I am being cheated on."
53,"I [32F] just found out that my boyfriend[31M] hasn't actually read any of the 700+ books in his home.


We've been dating for five months. When I first visited his home, I was amazed by how many books he had. He had wall to wall shelves in his living room with 700+ books. He claimed to have read almost all of them. I am an avid reader, so this was very attractive to me. 

After looking through his shelves, it became clear that we read different genres. He had tons of philosophy, history, and economic books. I mostly read fiction, so we didnt talk much about the current books we were reading. After a few months of dating though, I decided to read one of his books so we could talk about it. 

When I finished it, I tried to ask him about it, but he claimed it was one of the ones he hadn't read yet. So I asked him to choose one for me to read, and he responded by telling me that it was ok that I didnt like his books and I didnt need to read one. 

Recently, his dog had surgery, right before he was going on a vacation with his friends. I stayed at his place for six days caring for his dog so he wouldnt have to cancel his trip. While I was there, I read four of his books. 

When he got back, I tried to talk about them, but it became clear after a while that he hadnt actually read any of them. So I pressed him about why he hadn't read any of the books I had, if he had read almost all of them. He made excuses but I kept asking him. Eventually he admitted that he just buys books every week for ""decoration purposes"" and hasnt actually read them all. I asked him which of of the books has he read then, and admitted that he had only skimmed a few of them. 

I was devastated to hear that. Reading is a big part of my life and I want to be with someone who also loves to read. Our relationship is great in all other aspects. Am I overreacting by considering breaking up with him?

**TL;DR** Boyfriend claims to have almost every book in 700+ book library, but admitted that he lied and hadn't read any of them."
54,"Is it normal that my parents [50s] track my location [22F] and ask me to text them constantly when im out?


My mother is extremely anxious about my safety, and has many routines in place to make sure that she knows where I am and that I am ""safe."" some examples:

\-She uses ""find my friends"" to track my location 

\-If I am going out, I must text her updates each time I arrive and leave a new location. (i.e. ""at walmart,"" ""leaving walmart,"" ""getting on the train,"" etc.)

\-If I am going to meet someone new or that i recently met, I must give her all the information I have (address, full name, pictures, phone number, etc). 

\-If i am not at home (staying with a friend, living on campus, etc) I must text every night that I am in my room safely and won't leave for the rest of the night, so she can sleep knowing i'm safe.

\-I cannot take lyft or uber alone, and she discourages me from taking trains or walking alone and usually wants to drive me/pick me up when I go out.

\-She says she cannot do anything productive if me or my brother are out of the house, because she needs to check our location constantly and be available if something happens and we need help. She does not have a job and considers parenting her full time job (her youngest is 18). I have had to cancel plans because she had something she needed to focus on. 

\-If I do not answer my phone within a few hours she will show up to wherever I am. (she recently showed up to a date's apartment because we were having sex and I did not answer my phone.)

I am moving out in a couple weeks but I know that is not going to change much. she also tracks my sister who is 25 and lives several states away with her fiancé. Me and my brother both picked an out of state college to transfer to, and my mom is now moving an hour away from that college (she says that it's to get my brother in-state tuition). 

How much of this is reasonable? Is it healthy to be this concerned about my safety? I am trying to figure out what healthy boundaries should be and im stuck between feeling suffocated by my parents, but also understanding they want to make sure im safe and alive. 

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR: My mom tracks my location AND asks that I text every time I change locations, etc. I'm feeling suffocated but don't know what reasonable healthy boundaries look like."
55,"So... my [29f] parents [50s] forgot my birthday and I'm feeling really hurt. Do I say something or am I being unreasonable?


Basically the title. It was my birthday yesterday and neither of my parents said anything at all.

I try not to be too demanding or have too many expectations about my birthday, a text message is enough for me, but they didn't even manage that and it really hurts. All day I waited for a call that didn't come, and it just brought up all these feelings that I don't really know what to do with. I feel like the black sheep in my family and have struggled with that my whole life so maybe I am just more sensitive than most about this kind of thing.

In my family we ALWAYS do a birthday dinner with the immediate family/spouses when someone's birthday comes along and this is the third year in the row that they have missed mine (everyone else got a birthday dinner, but not me).... but this is the first time they've gone the whole day without even saying anything. It's starting to feel intentional and not just a matter of mismatched schedules or whatever.  


On one hand, I'm 29 years old and I feel like this shouldn't bother me as much as it does. I'm a big girl, I should be able to roll with the punches. But at the same time, I feel really left out and neglected by my family, especially when they are willing to pull out all the stops with a handmade cake etc. for my SIL and BIL, but can't be bothered to send me a text message.  


I don't know if it's worth saying anything to them about how hurt I feel. I don't think it would change anything, and might just set me up for more disappointment next year if they forget again. I don't even think they noticed that I didn't get a birthday dinner these past few years to be honest.. but I don't want to have to ask for it you know?   


Am I unreasonable for feeling hurt? Are birthdays just something that naturally falls to the wayside as you get older? Do I care about this stuff too much or would this hurt your feelings too?  


**TL;DR: My parents forgot my birthday. They make a big deal out of everyone else's birthdays, including my siblings' spouses, but  for 3 years in a row now they have skipped over mine and this time they didn't even bother to send me a text message.  Is it wrong of me to feel extremely hurt by this? Should I try to talk to them?**"
56,"My [f34] marriage with my husband [m38] is falling apart before my eyes which started when I got pregnant nearly 3 years ago


My husband \[m38\] and I \[f34\] met at work and have been together since which has been 5 years now. Things were great in the bedroom until I got pregnant. I had a miserable pregnancy where I ended up gaining 80+ lbs. Things were dead in the bedroom because I felt awful constantly with a crazy list of issues. After I gave birth I lost over 70lbs in the first 3 weeks. I got an IUD due to being terrified of having to go through that nightmare again. 

21 months since I gave birth things are still completely dead in the bedroom. We both work full-time jobs and both make the same amount (my point being it is a 50/50 contribution).  I do all the cooking, mowing the yard most weeks, cleaning (dishes, cleaning after animals, floors, etc), and take care of the baby when we are at home. He does handle most of the laundry and weed wacks the yard 1-2 times a month. It is frustrating to do the extra work but I deal with it. 

Today, I actually understood why I don't try to pursue him more in the bedroom. He is almost always complaining that something hurts like his neck, back, shoulder, and/or arm multiple times a day. I have given up on trying to help him because he doesn't listen or refuses to try anything I suggest but he also refuses to go to the doctor for anything. I do understand not going to the doctor for every little sniffle but IMO if it is bad enough to complain about constantly for several weeks/months then it is bad enough to go to the doctor. How can I pursue someone in the bedroom who is always complaining of being in pain? 

Besides the bedroom issues, I feel taken for granted. I don't make a big deal out of holidays/birthdays but it is nice when someone thinks of me during these times. Mother's day, my husband handed me a card that he literally just went to the store and got and said he didn't have time to write anything in it. He didn't even sign his name or put the card in the envelope. Something as simple as breakfast in bed would have been great. Just something that showed he thought about me and appreciated me. 

My birthday, he forgot until my dad called me to wish me a happy birthday. He then went to harbor freight to get me a workbench I was looking at the week before but they were out. It was however on sale so he got a rain check and handed it to me when he got home. There was never a word about that workbench again and here we are 8 months later. 

Just for a bit of perspective, on Father's day, I painted a wooden panel that hangs on the wall which said Dad &amp; (daughters name) with lots of photos of the 2 of them together attached using wooden clips. I spent months on this for him. It is sitting in the closet now. For his birthday, I planned out the entire day with a sitter, dinner, movie and Dave and Busters and of course a card from our daughter and me. 

Anytime I try to talk to my husband about fixing us, he immediately starts to cry and assumes I am kicking him out and ending the relationship which I would never do that. I ask him for suggestions but I get 0 input. I love my husband and I do want us to be a family but I feel like we are parents who are just staying together for the kid. I feel neglected. How can I make this work and get through to him? How can I get things going in the bedroom nearly 3 years of having a dead bedroom? I am not ready to throw in the towel. 

TL;DR

My \[f34\] marriage with my husband \[m38\] is falling apart before my eyes which started when I got pregnant nearly 3 years ago. We have not had sex since our daughter was concieved nearly 3 years ago."
57,"I (F26) just found my husband’s (M26) open to Grindr


Bear with me, this just happened and I’m in shock.

We have two young children. I am previously divorced from a really bad, abusive marriage. My husband is not openly bisexual but I know he is sexually attracted to men and women.

Our sex life is pretty good. It’s not daily or anything, but it’s pretty healthy. We both seem to enjoy it and we experiment enough to keep it enjoyable. He has mentioned being interested in a threesome at some point but has never pushed the issue past my comfort zone.

I stayed up later than him tonight and when I came to bed, he had fallen asleep with his phone in his hand. It was open to Grindr.

I didn’t know he had Grindr. He’s been a little uncharacteristically protective of his phone lately, and I just brushed it off. I didn’t dig through. I was half afraid of waking him up and half afraid of what I might find. As I closed the app, I saw that he also has tinder.

I just..I don’t even know. I feel like my world just got turned upside down. I got out of this shit marriage a few years ago. I met my husband and we had a great relationship. I’ve dealt with many other shitty situations since, but our relationship has stayed pretty strong.

How do I even confront him about this? What do I say? I can’t believe this is happening.

Here’s the kicker-he started becoming protective of his phone a few months ago after I started down the road to possible diagnosis with a degenerative disease.

I don’t know. Part of me feels like this is my fault. If my health is deteriorating, maybe this is his way of coping? I’m so lost. 
  
TL;DR: Married, 2 young kids. Husband is bi. I thought our relationship was happy and I love him very much. Just found he’s been browsing Grindr and Tinder. Don’t know how to address it. Please help."
58,"My (26f) bf(26m) is sharing a hotel room with female friend and I’m freaking out


Original post deleted for using the d word.

Hello all. Longtime lurker on my main account, new time poster. I (26f) will try to make this short. TLDR at bottom. Posted on JustNoSo as well so sorry if this is the second time you see this post!

So for a bit of history: my bf (26m) has always come off a bit selfish in our 4.5 years together. We used to fight a lot about it in the beginning of our relationship and I used to post on my other account asking advice when he was being a jerk and a lot of people made me realize that I was more like a mother to him than SO. We had discussions about it and he said he would work on himself to be a better partner. In 4 years he’s def made progress and I’m proud of him but he always hiccups here and there. We’re at a point in our relationship (post-fight from three weeks ago) where we are finally completely open and honest about our feelings and the things we are working on to be better partners to each other and holding each other and ourselves accountable when we start to lapse in our growth.

The friend: so my BF is kind of up and coming in this gaming community and this girl has been helping him as a guide and friend to get him into tournaments and network. Super cool and supportive of this as I want him to enjoy his hobbies as life professionally for him has been really rough. She has been there for him in both the gaming community and at times of emotional support where I was absent. I started to feel insecure about her because I obvs should have been the emotional support he needed but it was her and well yeah I feel insecure. That and they have a really core thing in common was making me feel out of place as my bf and I don’t do a whole lot together in terms of hobbies. I just try to be ok and supportive of it.

My beef with her rn: overall she seems cool imo, but their friendship is starting to get weird and needy. They talk pretty regularly over this game but two/three weeks ago she was going through a thing and he told her he would be there for her when she needs. Going as far and staying up all night or waking up early to make sure he called her to tell her to go to bed. Then the phone calls started happening more frequently and personal. I sometimes overhear minor but sometimes still inappropriate things from both sides (mostly her and he just sort of brushes it off). Then she invites him to Vegas for a tournament and he jumped at the chance. That pissed me off bc for four days I’ve been trying to get him to go to some job fairs with me for employment and he wasn’t budging and I was upset that he was choosing her and this event over me and our professional growth. 

He is still going to Vegas but agreed to go to one job fair with me. In this past week, this girl calls and wants to talk to him between 2-5 times a day, and learned his identity for hotel purposes (he is super secretive and paranoid of his identity for doxxing reasons and this kinda bothered me bc he gave her his identity as if it was no big deal but I guess since they’re going to this tournament together it’s par for the course.)

Then I learn they’re SHARING A ROOM. I was like absolutely not wtf and he said he didn’t find it weird bc he makes sure to set friendship boundaries and swears they’re just bros and that she’s gay so there’s no way anything will happen. I have complete trust in him and not worried about him hooking up with her but this hotel issue is bothering me from a boundary standpoint and idk how to address it. Plus just bc she’s gay doesn’t mean she wouldn’t be interesting in experimenting with someone she likes and is very good looking? That’s how I was able to discover my own bisexual identity. 

The cherry on top was this weekend. All weekend they were on call together and me and her actually started doing parallel things that freaked me out. Like she called to tell him she was making pesto shrimp pasta while I just happened to be doing the exact same thing. Then she kept drawing all these parallels between us and making jokes that we’re alike and asked him if we did one more parallel thing would he cancel the trip? He said yes because it’s kind of weird. She laughed it off. This happened last night when me and him were supposed to hang out. I was initially cool with him taking the call bc at least I was in the room and she said she was going to bed in 5 minutes. 5 turned to 40 and she’s asked to see pics of my tattoo and asking me what my recipes are and just a bunch of stuff. And finally I asked bf to get off call bc of the time. He ends the call and I start the talk.

I said I’m insulted that she keeps calling and that he keeps taking her calls, especially when we’re hanging out, even if it’s not anything special. He said it’s bc she asks (and I don’t have the exact wording he said but the ways she asks is IMO just the tiniest bit manipulative) bc she always prefaces it with hey can we talk something happened and sometimes something has happened but not always and she just wants to talk and so he always answers (he’ll ask me if I’m cool with it and I don’t say no bc I don’t want to be controlling or anything).  He said he understood but feels an obligation to her bc he said he would be there for her and she has recently made a Twitter comment about how talking to her friends more often and openly has been making her so happy. I said I’m happy you’re making a positive change in someone’s life, but you need to set boundaries rn before she becomes codependent on you. You can’t have two girlfriends. We had a small talk about it before we established that from now on, if we’re spending time together he won’t answer her or anyone else’s calls and schedule calls for when we’re not having bonding time. I agree and go to sleep.

Am I overreacting for wanting some boundaries between them? I have no issues with them being friends, but the truth is, they’ve been friends for like three weeks (he’s respected her and talked with her in the gaming group for maybe half a year?) and now he’s going two time zones away to be with her for the weekend sharing a hotel room? That on top of her sudden desire to see what else we have in common and how funny it will be if more parallels happen (I.e cooking the same dish, watching the same show, saying the same opinion out loud at the same time, driving the same car) is starting to really freak me out. I don’t think she’s actually trying to be me for him or what but I feel super out of place. I feel like there’s nothing I can do with my bf without her being on the call or doing the same thing, just without my bf being there. Coupled with the fact that they have this game in common that’s a big part of his life, I almost feel replaced by this girl. Last night bf reaffirmed his love for me and told me I’m his best friend which def made me feel better, but idk Reddit, this girl feels like a threat to me and idk how to move forward with this trip coming up in about 30 days.
 
Advice ok if anyone wants give up some hard pills to swallow.

TLDR; bf’s friend is becoming dependent on him and is sharing a hotel with him and I feel like she’s replacing me.

Edit: on last post someone pointed out that he’s cheating or emotionally cheating or the friend is planning to make a move. I just want to say, he’s not cheating we live together and she lives in a different state they just talk on discord and he’s very open with me about their friendship so I know everything about her and what they talk about. MY BIGGEST FEAR is that this girl is gonna try and hook up with him or try to get him to leave me bc she feels she has an in and I feel like he’s overlooking this bc he wants to be a big brother."
59,"Mom (50F) is making me(17F) pay a lot just for bringing my bf (19M) on a vacation


So this requires a little backstory.  
My mom and dad are divorced, and my mom only works 14 hours a week. We basically live off of alimoney, and I don't get a lot of money to buy clothes etc. Hence I have been working since I am 13. I have never ever made a single problem out of it that, I always just paid my own stuff and gave things to my little brother (13M).   
Me and my bf have been together for 5 months now, and since 3 months ago we have been planning for him to join on the vacation. He would be driving one car, my mom and her BF would be driving the other.   
Since my sister and her best friend would join  on the vacation too (spoiler: they don't have to pay anything for the vacation) we need two cars, and if my BF would not join they would need to rent a bigger car. (for 7 persons for two weeks, so that'd be crazy expensive).  


I thought it was quite reasonable when my mom made me pay €200 for the vacation, because he will both save us money but of course it's just the justified thing to do since we have to cook extra meals etc. If you would really make an equation, he saves us more money than he costs us, but I don't mind just the 200 euros (it's about a month's salary for me so it's still a lot, but I did not complain about that, even though my sister doesn't have to pay for anything).  


Thing is, after we decided I'd be paying €200, which I split up with my BF because that's obviously more fair, my mom started bugging me every day about wanting his parents to pay for it too. She wanted more and more money, and she said that only when she had €500 she would consider me not paying anymore. I got absolutely furious about this, because the vacation in itself is very very cheap (we are driving from the Netherlands to France, and we are renting a very cheap place there. We won't eat any meals out or do any expensive activities), but I kept quiet because my mom and me have a lot of fights already.  


It didn't stop there though, she went on and on disrespecting my BF's parents. I know that they are amazing persons that work very hard for their children, so I got mad about it and tried telling her to stop, with no result. My BF talked to his parents and they decided to spend €100 (Which is completely justified, they have 5 children and it's not like they're rich but it's already pretty generous since he is an adult). When I notified my mom about this, she was super disrespectful again, saying that it was really not enough and that she thinkgs it's bad of them.  
My mom has never paid anyone else for vacations my sister&amp; I had joined on, and my sister never had to pay for any vacation her best friend joined on. It's absolutely hypocritical in my eyes.  


I tried to talk to her about this but it ended up in a fight. I want to approach her about this subject because in my eyes I have to pay quite a lot and she is just being so disrespectful. I don't want my BF to feel uncomfortable at my house because of this. How do you all think I should approach the situation without causing fights?  


TL;DR My mom makes me pay for the vacation in a hypocritical way (in my eyes) which causes fights and I really want to resolve this situation to make it stop."
60,"I'm (27F) feeling conflicting and frustrating feelings about my boyfriend (36) grabbing a drink with his female coworker (27F).


I guess I'm upset because I've never found my boyfriend's coworker to be particularly friendly towards me. She's not overtly mean but she'll definitely box me out of the conversation and steer the conversation towards work (which I can't contribute to because I don't work with them). Last time I bumped into her without my boyfriend present she told me that they were planning a camping trip together and made no suggestion that I was invited. I told all of this - my feelings, that interaction - to my boyfriend and he shrugged most of it off but clarified that the camping thing was just an idea that he knew would fall through and went along with it for the sake of friendliness. 

I think I should mention that right now my boyfriend has a leg injury that has him in a cast and crutches. I've been running around taking care of him - grocery shopping, cooking, taking him to appointments, getting up early to take the dog to daycare, running errands. On top of a 3 hour round trip commute to work every day.

I'm. So. Tired.

But I also love that dummy so of course I would do anything for him and it didn't bother me until tonight.

Because of his injury, my boyfriend has been a homebody and when I've wanted to get out and blow off some steam, he hasn't wanted to join.

The other day I couldn't take the dog to daycare so my boyfriend had his coworker stop by the house and hang out with the dog for an hour. And i'm grateful for that favor. But...

What bothers me is that right now he's at a bar having drinks with her as a ""thank you"" for watching the dog. I hauled ass at work so I could leave early to pick him up from work and halfway home he mentions that he has plans with her and that ""you can come if you want to"".

That really got my blood boiling.

I'm jealous that he's putting in the effort to do something nice for her, but can't seem to muster up the energy to do something nice for me despite my giving him all my time for the last few weeks.

I realize that sometimes in relationships you start to take your partner for granted. I don't know how to bring up my frustration without sounding petty, because this feels petty. 

tl;dr

I'm jealous that my boyfriend made time to hang out with his female coworker (who I dislike) but doesn't have the energy to go out with me despite me taking care of him around the clock."
61,"How do I (25F) respond to compliments or questions on unintentional weight loss?


To make a long story short, I have had a difficult two years. After two particularly traumatic events, I began suffering from severe depression and anxiety. Before these events occurred, I was obese. Unfortunately, in approximately 20 months, I have lost 150 pounds due to the physical manifestations of my mental health issues. 

I don’t know how to respond when people compliment me. I say thanks and try to leave it alone, but many people follow up with a question about “how I did it,” and I don’t know what to say. I didn’t put in effort aside from doing some walking in an attempt to feel better, so I feel some guilt. In addition, people don’t understand that I have been ill and I wouldn’t wish my “weight loss experience” on anyone. I’m visiting some friends I haven’t seen in a couple of years, so I would really appreciate the help. Thank-you.

TL;DR How do I respond to compliments on unintentional weight loss due to depression and anxiety without making it awkward?"
62,"My[25F] BF [30M] of 5 years lied about where he was after not coming home for a couple days


Hello lovely redditors! The title sounds slightly deceiving, but I didn't know a better way to word it without being too specific. Let me say upfront, I don't think he is cheating or anything, but I don't know how to resolve these trust issues.

&amp;#x200B;

So my BF and I have been dating 5 years, living together for 4. Things have been pretty great for the most part, although finances and chores have been the main subject of concern in terms of arguments we have every now and then. I won't get into that right now because there is another more concerning incident that happened recently.

&amp;#x200B;

So last Friday, like every other Friday, we left for work in the morning and said our goodbyes, love yous, see you later sort of thing. I come home from work later that day and my partner isn't home in the evening, He stays out late at work often with his coworkers so I wasn't too worried. Midnight hits so I send a text asking if he is out and get no response. 3 AM hits and I start to get worried as my partner sometimes gets a little crazy and passes out at bars/friends places. I send another message, try a call but no response. His messenger says inactive for a while, I assume his phone is dead but my anxiety is still amped. 

&amp;#x200B;

I woke up on Saturday and he still wasn't home. Ask if he is okay and still receive no answer. He finally gets home on Sunday night and tells me he got in an accident. I freaked out and felt really bad for being mad at him for never letting me know where he was.  He said he got in an accident, then stayed at a friends place and went straight to work the following day. He complained he back was hurting all night and said he thought he might have a concussion.

&amp;#x200B;

Tonight he tells me he didn't actually get in an accident. He actually went to see the new remake of my favorite childhood film (probably an easy guess for you all). He went with some people across from the place he works but they also took psychedelics for it and he thought I would be mad so he lied. I'm not mad about the psychs as this is something I enjoy as well and has given me so much perspective and thankfulness in my life. I am mostly upset he felt he had to lie to me. I am also a little upset since I have been in love with this film since I was a kid and he chose to go see it with some acquaintances instead of his partner. We had talked about seeing it together before it came out, but never specifically made plans so I can forgive that. But the randomly not coming home for a few days and lying about being injured is what really gets me. I literally went full caretaker mode as soon as he said he was hurt. But he made it up. 

&amp;#x200B;

We just signed a new lease for our place for the coming year. Things have been slightly rocky but I haven't been outright lied to before, as far as I know. I don't even know why I'm posting this, this is obviously a boundary for me. For context, I am the most open, honest person ever, pretty much to a fault so this actually kills me a bit that he felt like he had to lie to me. I grew up with a very abusive and manipulative mother so I feel extra cautious going forward. I have tried to make it work but he doesn't put in much effort around the house and apparently is lying now. He owes me a lot of money so I feel a little trapped, though if he can't even be honest with me I don't know if it is even worth it at all. This is mostly a rant, I apologize, I just need some motivation. I'm in therapy for my childhood/sexual trauma, but I can never get rid of the feeling that I am overreacting. I have been wanting to do a couples therapy session to resolve these trust issues, but it's pricey and I don't even know if it is worth if he is just straight-up lying to me.

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR; Live-in BF was gone without any response/notice for a couple of days. When he got back he said he got injured in an accident and stayed at a friends house. Later told me he lied about the accident and went to see my favorite childhood film remake in theatres, tripping with some people he works across the street from."
63,"Me [32 M] with my girlfriend [28 F]. We planned a vacation and she just remembered she has an important work thing during the dates we've set in stone together. Not the first event of this type and I'm at my wits end.


I love my girlfriend. We get along great. We are like minded, we have interesting conversations and the sex is simply amazing and fulfilling for both of us.

But she can't adult for shit. She has trouble getting her shit together, planning things and being responsible in general. Which is weird, because her line of work is really hard and demands a lot of organization. 

The armchair psychologist in me thinks that it's because her parents spoiled her all of her life, and enabled this kind of behavior. They're amazing people. They bought her a condo in a hip district in town, pay for her car and do everything for her. It's full of love but I believe it lacks a bit of toughness sometimes.

I digress.

We've been a couple for about 5 months. During this time, which was mostly amazing, a few events of this type happened. She'd double book things, she'd forget things we planned together and she showed some signs of irresponsibility.

It's something we've fought about and discussed thoroughly, most of the times in a constructive manner. She's clearly putting in some effort to get her shit together, but it's obviously a work in progress. We've discussed of potential areas of improvement and ways to get her on track, such as using her agenda to book things and double checking when planning things.

It’s summer and we’ve been having a great time. We’ve discussed going on vacation together and we were both interested in a road trip in the eastern US. We’ve settled on some dates in early September. I asked her multiple times to double check that there were no conflicts, as my workplace can be a bit iffy when asking for vacation on such “short notice”. She told me that there would be no issue, so I asked for the time off, which was a pain as we’re starting a new project and things are going fast and there’s a lot of work to do. After some negotiation and the approval of my team mates, I was able to get the time off.

We start planning the trip and we’re both excited. We have a vague plan of what and when, but nothing set in stone, just how we like it. I call my parents and arrange for them to dog sit. Everything is looking perfect so far.

Yesterday, we were having a great day, until we went to the park to chill and take out the dog. I mentioned that I checked some places we could stay and visit during the trip. She then nonchalantly told me: “oh, about the vacation, there’s a problem”. 

Apparently she forgot she had a work event right in the middle of the dates. She forgot to book it in her agenda and there is no one else that can take over for her.

I was livid. I didn’t lose it, just went silent and tried to process the whole thing until we could have a rational conversation about it. She respected my wish for space, apologized and went silent too.

She apologized profusely, and was obviously feeling badly about the whole thing. She blamed herself a lot and understood my frustration. I really wasn’t angry at that point, more disapointed than anything. I told her how hyped I was for everything, how I had to work a lot of get the time off and how I tried to organize everything only for it all to fall apart.
She asked me if I was sick of her shit. I didn’t really have an answer.

We discussed during the night, relatively calmly. I asserted that she needed to get her shit together and that I would get sick of her. I also told her that I know she’s a work in progress and I can see how much effort she’s putting in, and that forgetting is human. I tried to power through it. 

This morning things were kinda normal, but she was obviously still feeling bad about herself. I told her I want to move on and learn from our mistakes, and try to reschedule or make everything work in some way.

But as the day goes on, I just feel annoyed and irritated about the whole thing. I’m really trying to be considerate of the fact that she’s trying hard and this was a mistake, but I’m also sick of this shit. 

I’m not sure what to do at this point, or even what I’m asking for with this post. Advice on how to improve this, maybe? I’m not sure. Perhaps it’s just venting.


TLDR: booked vacation with girlfriend, she didnt check her dates and had a work thing right in the middle, not the first time a thing like this happened, not sure what to do now."
64,"My [26F] boyfriend [30M] has brain cancer and his medication is changing who he is. I don't know how to handle it


My boyfriend ""B"" \[30M\] and I \[26F\] have been together for 2 years, and it has been quite the whirlwind. Shortly after we started dating he was diagnosed with terminal brain cancer (glioblastoma multiform, stage IV). I want to preface this entire post with the fact that I truly believe this man is the love of my life and the person I want to be with for as long as humanly possible. He is everything I want and more, but we have had some very concerning incidents that I’m hoping others can provide perspective on. I want to be a supportive partner and be able to handle the lowest of the lows but I feel like I have zero understanding of what is happening.

Because he presented with seizures, B has been on an anti-seizure medication called Keppra since before his craniotomy, and was ramped up to the highest dose possible (3000mg per day). Keppra is a known mood altering medication, there have even been published scientific research articles investigating what has been coined “Kepprage”. Essentially, we both blame this drug for turning my loving and caring boyfriend into a complete asshole (at times). Since being together, B has done the following to me:

* Try and end the relationship multiple times, and within an hour or so will take it back
* Called me every name in the book
* Comes up with hypothetical situations and then proceeds to get angry at me over them
* is constantly paranoid I am cheating on him
   * This one comes with a caveat: No I have not cheated on him, but before we were official I had flirted with a few guys (nothing physical, and no dates, just texting). When he interrogated me I admitted to this. 
* He has spat on me 4 or 5 times in heated arguments, interrogating me about my faithfulness
* He has kicked and shoved me twice in heated arguments, punched walls/furniture and broken things. This one sucks, because the guy I dated before B was physically abusive, and B knows this. 

After these incidents he is always completely disgusted with himself and says that a blind rage takes over him, and he feels out of control. He claims to have never ever acted this way in any relationship in the past. I am inclined to believe him because I met his previous ex whom he was with for a decade and they are still friends. But my fear is that I have never known my boyfriend off of Keppra. We are currently looking into switching him to another medication, but that could take months. I understand there are also a hundred other emotions at play here. My young, capable boyfriend is still coming to grips with the fact that he may die very soon depending on how treatment goes. I can’t even begin to understand what that feels like. I want to be the most supportive person that I can while we battle through this, but sometimes I feel like I’m only making it worse by being here and causing him all this stress. 

I guess what I’m looking for from this community is:

1. Do you have loved ones who react like this on specific medication? How do you manage it, and how can I provide support when it seems all rationality leaves the room? 
2. Is this relationship worth pushing through these really difficult incidents that are likely a combination of medication side effects, grief, anxiety, depression, fear, etc? I don’t want to give up on my partner, but I’m starting to question whether I’m actually helping him or not.
3. If anyone here has taken Keppra or knows someone who has, I would love to hear anything and everything you have to say. 

&amp;#x200B;

**TLDR: My boyfriend is battling stage 4 brain cancer and is on a mood altering medication for seizures, which is impacting our relationship significantly. What the hell do I do? How do I be supportive when shit hits the fan?**"
65,"My (24F) boyfriend (23M) forbid me to talk about our future together


Two days ago I decided to have a talk with my boyfriend of 2,5 years about future plans. The reason why I decided to do that is because three months ago he returned back home from nearly 1,5 years of studies abroad and I thought the moment would be very fitting.


I explained, that I wanted to find out what’s the next move for me/him/us, so that we can be on the same page and, potentially, plan some things out. He has yet to find a job and has just been enjoying his time of peace away from studies, while still living with his parents. I thought this might be a good timing to figure out if he plans on finding his own place or, maybe, moving in together. 

So — the call started with talks about things not related to our relationship directly: work, education, hobbies and so on. As soon as we finished talking about that, without saying a single word about our relationship, he changed the subject and wanted to move on. So I decided to bring us up. 

I asked him if he has any plans concerning us, now that he’s back in town for good. He replied: “Just continuing being happy with you”, which I thought was him eluding from being specific. I made sure to clarify what I meant, by giving examples of travel, moving in together etc. 

His then response killed me. The first thing that I hear him say about his vision for our future was: “I can’t see myself living with you anytime soon” with “I can’t see myself being married within the next 10 years” following shortly. When I was just about to speak, he also managed to add: “Oh, and I don’t even know if I want kids”. It’s funny he even mentioned the latter, because I entered this relationship saying that I’m not dating to break up and that I would love to have a family someday and he agreed and said that’s what he wants, too. I felt slightly betrayed hearing that. 

Needless to say, the conversation went downhill very quick and we ended the call upset. 

The next day he reached out to me by text and wrote: 

“Yesterday’s conversation was extremely hard. I don’t want to hear any talks about the future, ideally, for the next several years. I hope you won’t bring it up again, because for me that would be a deal breaker”. 

Reddit, I am, honestly, speechless and beyond confused. We had lighthearted conversations about our future plans before and he never got this upset. I don’t know what I did wrong by trying to have a serious and very important talk... 

At this point I’m wondering — does he even see a future with me? Or he just freaked up? 

TL;DR: I talked to my boyfriend about our future together and he took it very bad, saying that if I mention it anytime soon, he might break up with me."
66,"Boyfriend (29M) Finds My (27F) sister (25F) Attractive


A little background: we've been dating for a little over a year. We connect on many levels, but I do sometimes feel some distance, as we can both be a bit closed off at times - that's something we're working on. I love this guy but I'm not sure yet if we will last, for a few unrelated reasons. This is my first serious relationship. I'm considered very attractive, but I don't fall into conventional Western beauty standards. My sister, however, is a classic beauty that fits into European beauty ideals (big lips, sculpted nose, etc..) We are a visible minority, my boyfriend is Caucasian. Reddit, the first time he met her, he literally blushed. From unrelated conversations with him, I know that she is exactly his type, and that he has a strong preference for it. This alone maybe I could get over, but what concerns me is that he has been overly critical of her on a few occasions. It felt unwarranted, and in my gut I have to wonder if this isn't a reaction to being attracted to her/conflicted about his attraction.

I find that my confidence has taken a hit being in this relationship. I always knew that my sister was considered conventionally prettier than me, but I loved my unique look and was secure in it, because I always thought that we all have people who will find us attractive, some one out there for everyone etc.. I believe his feelings for me are genuine, I don't want these doubts to ruin what we have, even if it won't last, because I really care about him and I feel sad that distrust is causing me to miss out on enjoying the love we share. It's also not something I can bring up, I feel, because once it's out there, you can't back track. One part of me says, hold it in, don't ruin what you have, but the hurt keeps pushing its head. 

tl;dr: I have a hunch that my boyfriend finds my sister attractive and it upsets me and undermines my confidence and trust in the relationship."
67,"My[26F] fiancé [25M] always tries to cancel plans to isolate us


Throw away. We’ve been together for 5 years. We’ve been having some rough patches, but one thing that’s really bothering me is whenever we have plans to hang out with our group of friends he tells me last minute he no longer wants to go. Which means I don’t get to go. And then flips the situation to say he would rather just do something with me and makes me seem like the bad person for wanting to keep the original plan. He hates going places and would much rather just sit at home playing games. 

For example, we were supposed to go on a trip this weekend. However, after work yesterday our friend grabbed him and me and took us to dinner and just hang out. Well he was so against doing it, because it meant not sitting at home, but didn’t say no to it, that when we got home I could tell something was wrong he got all short with me. Then told me he doesn’t want to go camping this weekend. When I told him I’m really looking forward to it and really want to go, he shut it down saying he doesn’t want to. Then said he wanted a weekend just the two of us. (Which is what we did the past two weeks in a row).  I would also like to add that last weekend we skipped a day trip so that he would want to go camping this weekend and didn’t have to go places two weekends in a row. 

My issue with this, is I don’t like canceling premade plans to schedule new ones. Especially because it’s the ONLY time he ever tries to plan something for the two to us. And I’ve been really looking forward to the camping trip. This is the first summer in 4 years I get to have a summer to go places and do things, and he is upset that I’m not staying at home every day/weekend. Told me I don’t like hanging out with him, even though we live together and spend every day together. 

This is going to end in one of two ways like it always does. I either give in and don’t get to go, or I push it and we end up going but he complains the whole time and is pissed off. Am I the bad guy in this? He said if my fiancé wants to do something I should cancel all plans to do them. 

I wanted to add also, the reason I say I can’t go without him is because one of our main friends I used to sort of be in a LDR with. Nothing ever physical but we did share pictures and stuff, so now that we know in person I’m not allowed to be around him without my fiancé. 


TL;DR: Fiancé doesn’t like going places, tried to cancel premade plans with friends to isolate us into doing something just the two of us. Only makes plans for the two of us if there are already plans made he decides he doesn’t want to do. Am I in the wrong for not wanting to cancel already made plans?"
68,"I (35/f) went on a job interview without telling my husband (37/m). Now he’s pissed. Was I wrong?


I’ve been looking for a new job. My husband knows that.
Last week I went on an interview. I didn’t tell anyone including my husband. It’s not that I have anything to hide. It’s that I have a lot of anxiety about the possibility of being rejected. I find job hunting to be very stressful and I’m looking to leave my current job ASAP so the pressure is on.

After the fact, I told my husband that I went on the interview and wanted to talk about it with him (I don’t even have an offer from the company at this point).He was fuming that I did not tell him beforehand. He’s refusing to talk about it with me now because he’s so upset.

Was I way out of line here? Or is he overreacting?

TL; DR: my husband is pissed that I went on a job interview and did not tell him until after the interview"
69,"My [30F] fiancée just admitted to cheating on [30M]me


At her bachelorette party this weekend. She told me this because ""we don't keep secrets""

I couldn't bare to listen to it. I stormed out of our apartment and got a hotel where I an currently laying in a  bed drinking whiskey. I figured it was better to just leave before I said or did something I regret. Im taking the day off work tomorrow to hike and try to get my head straight before I confront her. But here's what she told me:

They we're out doing typical bachelorette party things. Her best friend and maid of honor, invited two guys they met to come back to the house they rented for after hours. Per fiancee, she was extremely drunk (not an excuse) and her friends were egging her on (also not an excuse). Honestly, that aspect equally unbelievable as the whole thing as I had high opinions on most of them before this weekend but not so much anymore.  Anyway, she was really drunk and asshole guy was very aggressive ( also not excuse). They made out and eventually slept in the same bed together. She said that nothing else beyond that happened. She said she's  knows this because she was not quite as drunk at this point. She also admitted to making out with a girl at some point this weekend as well. 

She's never really given me any reason not to trust her until today. Though for obvious reasons I have serious doubts about her recollection of the night. I'll  never really know if anything beyond kissing actually took place. I imagine her shitty friends would cover for her if I asked them. I'm so shocked, hurt, and furious. I feel betrayed. I felt like we had truly special but now my trust in her is shattered. How can I marry someone I don't trust?

Is what I described above worth throwing everything away? Am I overreacting? Our wedding is in 7 weeks and we've been together for over 6 years. What the hell am I supposed to do about this?


tl;dr : my fiancee admitted to sleeping with another man during her bachelorette party.  Claims that they did nothing more than kissing but I dont know if I believe her or if that even matters."
70,"My (30f) fiance (37m) hasn’t paid a dime for our wedding and now all of a sudden he can afford a 900 dollar tux.


I really need advice here that’s unbiased so I hope you guys can help. My fiancé doesn’t make a lot of money. He said from the start that he wouldn’t be able to contribute to the wedding, but that he could save and pay for when we move in a year. I figured that was reasonable and the wedding isn’t extravagant. I make a lot of money so I don’t mind helping out. 

The last thing I’ve wanted to do is pressure him to help, but sometimes I was mad. The cake is like 50-80 bucks depending on our head count and he said he couldn’t even afford that. We saw a 300 dollar custom tux that he could own and he said he couldn’t afford that either. He said he was going to use a tux from ten years ago and just pay to get it altered and dry cleaned. He asked me if I wanted to go on a honeymoon and I said, “yes, but I’m not paying for anything else. I’m stressed out financially and it’s hard when you can’t help with anything. I don’t want to make you feel bad. I understand you make less than me. Maybe when you start making more, you can take me on one later?” He said, “ok. I wish I could afford more. I’m sorry.”

That convo happened a week ago about the honeymoon and last night he came home and said he decided to pay for a 900 dollar suit. I was so confused. This whole time he’s been telling me how he can’t even afford a 50 dollar cake or 300 dollar tux and now he’s spending 900?! He claims now that he’s full time at his job (happened last month) that he felt like it was important he spent the money to look good. While I appreciate the sentiment, I’m really upset bc he didn’t even offer to help with anything I asked for the last few months. In addition, our reception is 785. He could pay off our reception costs for less than his tux!!

I’m starting to second guess getting married now. I don’t want to walk down the isle with someone who’s so selfish. He claims looking good was for me, but I feel taken advantage of for some reason. I feel like he’s gravely under appreciated me for paying for it all and I’m sad that when he came upon money, he didn’t even offer to pay for anything towards the wedding. 

TL;DR fiancé makes less than me and told me he couldn’t contribute anything to our wedding, despite my financial stress. Now, he’s saying he can afford a 900 dollar tux and is wanting to do that, but never offered to pay for anything I’ve been asking for these last months. I feel confused on what to do. Wondering if I should marry someone who I know see as selfish and ungrateful. I can’t see it from his side which is “I did it for you, so you can think I look good and be proud.”"
71,"Are we [27F/29M] falling out of love? Is this normal when couples move out together?


 

Hi all. I’m pretty new to posting, so please bear with me. I’d love to hear your opinions/advice because I don’t know who else to turn to :( 

SO \[29M\] and I \[27F\] have been dating for 5 years, moved in together for 1 year. Prior to moving in, we saw each other once a week at most. Because of his long and inconsistent hours of work, we cherished our time together more as we don’t know when we’ll see each other next. Since the beginning of our relationship, we have not had any major fights and got along really well. Four years into dating, we felt it was ready for the next chapter of our life to move in together. The idea was to get a glimpse of what marriage would look like, financially and emotionally, before a lifetime commitment.  

Fast forward one year, we’ve adapted to our new lifestyle together with no major issues. But I hate to admit that I’m feeling a bit stressed, bored and less attached/intimate. Most of our “dates” right now comprises of grocery shopping, house chores, Netflix and the rare day out. Because of his work schedule, he’s usually too tired to go out and would rather stay in and game with his buddies. I don’t have a problem with him gaming, but I do have a problem with him not spending quality time together. When we are spending time together, he’s always scrolling on his phone (it drives me crazy!). 

I feel like we’ve become too comfortable with each other and not making an effort anymore. Often times, I wished we were how we used to be — even though we saw each other less, we actually went on adventurous dates. I’m stressing because we’re just dating now, how will it be when we’re married or have kids? Is it normal to go through this “comfortable” stage in life or does it mean we’re falling out of love? Any advice is much appreciated! 

**TD;LR! SO \[29M\] and I \[27F\] moved in together to get a glimpse of what marriage would look like. After one year of living together, I’m feeling stressed, bored and less intimate. Is this normal or are we falling out of love? Advice?**"
72,"My (24F) autistic neighbor (30sM) has a crush on me, and it's getting to the point I can't go in my front yard anymore.


My neighbor lives with his parents as he's incredibly low functioning. He has the mind of a child, and I am very understanding of disabilities such as this, my best friends little sister had autism, but she's high functioning, like she'll be able to eventually move out on her own, drive a car, etc while he never will be able to.

I moved into my house about 2 and a half years ago, his parents are awesome neighbors. They are aware of what's going on. They told me straight from the get go, if I have any issues to go to them. But we're both running out of ideas. When I moved in I was blonde, and he apparently has a thing for blondes. No big deal. It all started out with him just waving at me and bowing from his front porch, didn't bother me at all. Crushes happen!

Well about a month or two ago I was outside washing my car and right when I finished he waved me over, and I decided to talk to (because up to this point he hadn't done anything other than wave) and he asked me on a date. I told him no thank you, I'm busy, and he asked me ""well what about in two weeks?"" and I said I'm not sure. A few days later I talked to his mom about it and she said she'd handle it. Well, he left me alone for a month or two. But now I've realized he waits until they leave to come outside, and watch me, and talk to me. He usually never left his yard.

Today I was, once again, cleaning my car. I saw his parents leave while I was doing it, and about 10 minutes later he was going in and out of the house, watching me. I knew what was about to happen, and when I finished I tried really quickly to put my car back in the garage, but he ran over into my yard, and told me it was nice to see me. I was shocked he came onto my property. He shook my hand and asked me out, again. I said no, I was about to leave for dinner, got in my car, and left. I parked in a Tim Hortons parking lot for an hour, went home, and he was waiting for me. I pulled in my garage and closed the door before even getting out of the car.

So, the only time he doesn't talk to me when I'm outside is if my dog is with me, he's scared of dogs. But it's not plausible for me to bring my dog outside with me every single time I go in my yard. She's scared of water (so she doesn't like me washing my car around her), I don't want to make her sit in the sun, etc. I also have to mow the yard, can't bring my dog with me to do that.

His parents know but they also have a lifestyle that doesn't allow them to always be home with him, nor afford anyone to watch him, and their family all lives in another state. Before I moved in, this wasn't a problem and they've lived in this neighborhood for 30 years, so this wasn't exactly something they ever had to budget for.

He doesn't scare me, but I also don't want to have to talk to someone everytime I'm outside and his parents aren't home or turn down dates, etc. They've talked to him but we are unsure of what to do. I'm unsure of what to do on my end.

Tldr: low functioning autistic neighbor keeps asking me out when his parents aren't around, they've talked to him and nothing works. I want to go outside without him always trying to talk to me."
73,"My wife [26F] gets mad/irritated whenever my [26M] parents ask me to watch their house/pets whenever they go out of town. I’m tired of being caught in the middle, how do I go about this?


My wife, let’s call her Alice, and I have been together for 10+ years, we got married very recently, this past May. We’ve always had one continuous rough spot, it’s always whenever my parents are going on vacation or going out of town, they ask me to watch the pets while they are gone. I oblige, because they are my parents. 

It usually consists of me just doing my own thing during the day, heading over around dinner time and staying the night at their house for no more than usually 2-3 days at a time. 

They asked me to watch their house next week and are especially leaning on me because they have a sick older dog who cannot walk very well, and one of their cats just recently contracted FIV (aids in cats) and is now almost fully blind. I grew up with both of these animals and I would watch the house no problem.

But, Alice hates it when I do and it’s always pulling teeth asking/telling her when my parents want me to watch the house. 

Her reasoning is that I have my own full time job, a wife, and that they are not my responsibility, we have 3 pets of our own we need to take care of and it is not fair for me to leave her to handle them for a set of pets that aren’t my own (which is tough to fathom, I grew up with those pets my parents have and I do feel obligated to help). She also says she feels like they are treating me like I’m still in high school and I just have all the free time in the world to help them with whatever. 

This has always been an issue for as long as I’ve been with her and it really sucks for me, I feel like I’m constantly put in a bind between her and my parents. 

I don’t mind watching the house, to which I would normally say yes, but I have told my parents no a few times before and they always ask me “why not?” And of course I can’t sit there and say “well, Alice said I can’t.” And I don’t want to anyone in a weird position, so I often just makeup some weird excuse.

Yes I’ve talked to Alice about this many times and it never really gets resolved. I’ve also talked to my parents about it and have recommended maybe they find another pet sitter in the future in case I cannot help and they haven’t done that either. 

It’s just very annoying to be put in this predicament every time the issue comes up. I don’t really know how to proceed.

**TL;DR - Parents want me to watch pets while they are gone, wife gets irritated and says I have other responsibilities and shouldn’t. I feel obligated to help but I’m torn between two sides all the time.**"
74,"Me F (65) Husband M (65) leaving 35 year marriage


My husband and I have been married for 35 years and we have 2 adult children living away from the family home.

Our marriage is not perfect but I thought we were good together, we own a business together and I thought everything was good until he told me a few days ago he wanted a divorce. I was shocked.

He is leaving our marriage to be with a woman 30 years his junior that he met through tutoring her (he is a retired mathematician). He told me he felt an incredible connection to her and this is something he wants to pursue with her. I was able to access some messages they have been sending to each other. It seems she had a rough patch with a guy she was with and my husband was supporting her through that time and they have now fallen for each other! They have spoken marriage and he has told her (from the messages i have read) that when he divorces me he will marry her. I can see from her messages that she resides in the other half of the world and she is moving here to our country to be with my husband. I am devestated. I don't know what to think or do. Is he having a midlife crisis? Is there anything I can do to make him stay? Has he lost his mind?

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR - husband leaving 35 year marriage for a woman 30 years his junior!"
75,"I [22F] am concerned my lifelong childhood friend [22M] is making a mistake dating this girl.


Our friend D, group met his girlfriend a few months back at a party. I am the only female in this friend group and have known D the longest. We have a special bond, like brother and sister, no feelings of attraction whatsoever as far as I know. Anyways, we meet this girl at the party and I notice a few red flags.

Flag 1. As soon as it's mentioned by D, that I've been by his side the longest and that I'm an important person to him, she gives me side eye and a sarcastic jealous tone. ""Oh isn't that soooooo great that your only remaining childhood friend is a female and she means soooooo much to you"" Everyone seems to ignore this,  but I noticed. 

Flag 2. We're playing a game of truth or dare/ fuck marry kill(idk not my idea). It's his gf's turn. She says she'd kill one guy, marry D, and fuck me. Again, the insecure/jealous tone comes out as she says to the group ,"" I'd fuck her because obviously she's the prettiest one here, I mean look at her, up and down, really give her a good look. I'm sure all of you could agree?"". Everyone nods except D, who looks down at the floor as his gf death glares at him.  I mean, this made me highly uncomfortable,  but I felt more bad for D.

Flag 3. She was yelling and screaming and lightly hitting him at one point because she took another guys phone and couldn't give it back.  So D, reached from under her after about 5 straight minutes of her arguing that it's hers now and wriggling so he couldn't grab it, to hand it back to the guy. D then said himself that she's a bit of a kleptomaniac.

Flag 4. She openly flirted with another guy in the friend group. D, looked embarrassed and a bit upset by this. 

After all this,  I have a bad taste in my mouth about her. I don't want D to get hurt, but he has a really hard time sticking up for himself and can get pushed around until someone steps in.

TLDR; Childhood friend has a gf that raises some red flags. I don't want him getting hurt, but don't know if I should speak up."
76,"I (F25) suspect that my husband (M26) is abusing our infant (10 m/o) daughter. What do I do?


Throwaway for obvious reasons.

I got pregnant while we were going through an extremely tough patch which I believe caused my husband to resent our daughter. He insisted on the pregnancy believing that it would save our relationship. It didn’t make things any better because his depression and other issues continue to go untreated as he doesn’t believe he has a problem. When I got pregnancy, he spent the entire 9 months telling me that the child wasn’t his. I’ve never been unfaithful. 

While he has never abused our son, I am concerned when it comes to our daughter. I feel like I sound crazy for even thinking of this but nothing else makes sense. For the last seven months, she has randomly had bruises throughout her body. In the beginning, I’d leave her with him to run an errand, and I’d come back to find her bruised in her face, arms or legs. Now, if I leave her with him for a second or two, she will come back to me with a bruise. He always brushed it off by either telling me she fell, or that our son somehow hurt her while he was looking away. 

Now she is extremely terrified of him. She will scream endlessly if he is to hold her. I no longer leave her with him, but if they are in the same room, she will quickly crawl to me or cry for me to pick her up. It has gotten to the point where she will go with a complete stranger instead of him. In return, he gets even more frustrated that she does not like him and calls her annoying and a brat. 

I truthfully don’t know if my mind is playing tricks on me or if she is trying to tell me something and I don’t know. I don’t know where to go from this, and how to begin and where to start. I love my baby more than anything in this world and I can’t dream of any harm coming to her. What do I even do? How do I even approach this?

TL;DR! I suspect that my husband is physically abusing our infant daughter. She is always bruised after being with him, even if just got a couple of minutes while I get something done. How do I approach the situation/confront him?"
77,"My (24 F) bf (24 M) is taking me being mugged extremely personally


I originally made this too long so I'm going to try to shorten it, hopefully it's detailed enough. 

Last night, I was mugged when me and my bf were walking home from a restaurant. The guy was huge - like over 6' and heavyset. Me and my bf are both around 5'5"", 5'6"" and slim. I had a crossbody purse so when the guy went to grab it, he ended up snatching me down with it. My bf begins to start fighting the guy for it and throwing punches. I tell him to stop because who knows if this guy has a weapon or something and nothing of value is really in my purse either. I was scared of the guy hurting him. I just unwrapped the strap from around me and handed it to the guy and he ran off. My bf continued to try to grab it for a second while I'm telling him to stop and the guy pushes him to the ground. This all happened in like 2 minutes. I only had my card in there but I easily turned it off with my banking app, and my phone was in my back pocket so nothing was really lost. My wrist was hurt a little from falling and my purse strap scratched my neck a little but that was it. 

However, my bf took this extremely hard. He said that he didn't protect me like he should have and basically said he let me down and was a horrible boyfriend and just was really distraught and embarrassed about it and being really hard on himself. That night we went to sleep, Im pretty sure he thought I was asleep but I was laying with my back against him and could feel his body shaking like he was sobbing and he was and tried to play it off like he wasn't. I tried talking to him about it and he didn't really want to talk about anything. 

Today he's still been having a hard time with it no matter how much I insist I'm fine. Idk if it just hurt his ego really bad. I know he has insecurities regarding his size. I'm not really sure why he's reacted so strongly. We live in a big city. This happens. I'll be fine. How can I comfort him? Help him deal with this?

TLDR; Was mugged while walking home with my bf; He unsuccessfully tried to intervene, was shoved down; Says he feels like he should have been able to protect me, is having a hard time dealing with it. How can I assure him it's okay and help him deal with this?"
78,"I (28F) have been upset because my husband (28M) said that his name should be on my diploma because he paid for it


Hi reddit, not sure where to start, but here goes. Please tell me if I'm being too sensitive and need to let this go. Sorry that it's a bit long, but feels good to get my feelings out. 


Husband has been supportive overall throughout our five years of marriage and was supportive of me while I was in graduate school. He knew that I planned to apply to a graduate program while we were dating so it's not like I sprung this on him. 


While I was in school, he would comment to his friends that he was paying for my school. I know this might sound minuscule, but those remarks hurt me. I was working full-time while I was attending classes. His paychecks covered bills and left us with spending money. My paychecks covered my tuition, went to our savings, and left us with more spending money. It felt like a team effort to me and like we were both contributing. Initially I thought that maybe he was trying to show off in some weird way, but eventually his remarks made me feel as though my financial contributions were being minimized. He actually encouraged me to quit working and focus on school at one point, but I opted not to because I didn't want to graduate in debt and knew that I would need to take out loans if we only had one income.  


After he made that comment several times, I told him that it was hurtful and made me feel like he didnt see us as equal partners. He apologized, but then made the same remark again after we discussed it. I, again, explained to him in a different way. He, again, apologized and this time around responded in a way in which I thought he understood why I felt the way I did. 


Fast forward to my recent graduation. I didn't go because I have no family where we live and I didn't want my husband to be alone and bored for however many hours. I had my diploma mailed to my mom's house because I wasn't sure if we would move by the time it came in the mail. We recently went to visit family and my mom brought my diploma and wanted to celebrate. When she brought out my diploma to give to me and congratulate me, the first words out of his mouth were, ""My name should be on there too because I paid for it."" My first time celebrating with family and those were the first words out of his mouth after the two conversations we had.


He apologized and told me he was joking, but how many times do I need to have a conversation explaining to him that his remarks and jokes make me feel like he's minimizing my accomplishments, minimizing my contributions, and not seeing us as equal partners? I'm at a loss. Maybe we need to go to therapy to discuss this, but will that even help? What will a therapist even tell him that I havent already said? He wants to start a family in the next couple of years now that school is over and we're more settled. He ideally would like me to be at home for a couple of years. If I'm already feeling belittled while I am contributing, is he going to belittle me even more if I stay at home with a baby? Perhaps he didnt mean any harm nor have malicious intentions? Just want an outsider's perspective. 

tl;dr Feeling as though my financial contributions and achievements are being minimized"
79,"I (16F) pushed my mum (40F) because she thinks that me and my brother (19) have a sexual relationship


Hey so I am 16, my brother is 19, my mum has said multiple times that she thinks me and my brother do things. She will be like “why are you guys cozied up together” or “what are you doing in your sisters room” or “get out of your brothers room I don’t want anything happening”. She will ask if my brother has touched me sexually and I’m just getting so sick of it she’s making me not want to hang out with my brother and it’s straining our relationship, when we have NEVER done anything I love him as a sibling that’s it. So I pushed her tonight, I just wanted her to get the fuck out, she didn’t fall down but she just got pushed back a bit. She got so upset and told me she couldn’t believe I did that. I was just over her accusations about me and my brother so I just got mad. She has no reason to think it. Was it really bad for me to do that?

TLDR; I pushed my mum tonight because she keeps thinking I have a sexual relationship with my brother, am I wrong for doing that?"
80,"My friend Jay (M16) and I (F15) recently found out that our friend Nat (M18) is dating a 12 year old.


TLDR; Jay and I are at a loss of what to do after finding out one of our friends who is going into college is dating a 6th grader. 

   Today I was told by my friend Jay that a 12 year old, who I will call Hanna, is dating an 18 year old. 
  This girl is in 6th grade, and sent screenshots to my friend Jay of Nat and her sexting. She told him not tell Nat what she was saying to us and obviously we aren’t going to do that, since this is disgusting behavior by Nat. We have told Hanna the consequences of her actions, but I think she is too young to understand the weight of the situation. Our friend Nat has no idea we know yet.
Hanna also told Jay that her and Nat are planning to have sex before school starts. I’m at a loss of words for how disgusting and vile Nat is being. I honestly didn’t expect him to be like that, explaining how he wants to do all these disgusting things to a 12 year old in the screenshots Hanna sent Jay. What the fuck do we do? How do we go about this? Do we confront him?"
81,"My (32F) sister (27F) wants to marry my childhood friend/high school sweetheart but he (31M) slept with our estranged mom and my sister does not know, I think.


I grew up with my three sisters and mom - our father separated himself from our mom when our youngest sister was born. Our neighbor was also a single mom and had two sons. Me and her son David were very close growing up and dated all through high school. Growing up my mom had several set backs and unfortunate events which slowly chipped away at her mental health. In addition, during my senior year of high school and freshman year of college I rebelled against everyone and everything - especially my mom. I completely destroyed my relationship with David and my mom. I was a horrible daughter and even worse girlfriend to David. I lied, cheated, and manipulated both of them to get my way. David was amazing - no matter what I did he put up with it and supported me. My mom could see through all my bullshit and would constantly call me out on it. Eventually things came to a crash.   
My mom came home and I was fooling around with another guy in my room. She barged in and refused to leave until the guy left - by this point I was heavy into drinking and was sleeping around - shortly after my mom barged in David came walking into my room. David knew our relationship was not good but he didn't know I was cheating on him. I still remember the look on his face - he sat muted in our living room couch as I tried to explain what happened and how much it wasn't my fault; nothing but lies. A few days later I ran away from home - I spent the next few months crashing at friends houses. I eventually got a job and rented my own place - got sober and met my now husband. We have two kids and live in Spain - he is in the Army and is stationed here.  
David and his family were always very close with my family since we lived next door and basically grew up together. My mom always favored David - he really was/is perfect. Shortly after I ran away my mom decided to purse David - David himself went off the deep end and started drinking and partying. One thing lead to another and David and my mom end up sleeping together. The only reason why I found out is because my youngest sister caught them - I then confronted my mom over a phone call and she admitted it. She said it was a one time thing and would never happen again. By this point I didn't care and had hurt both my mom and David so much I just dropped the whole thing. I was already married and pregnant with my first. My two sisters had moved out as soon as my youngest sister turned 18. My mom lives on her own and moves around a lot. She has issues with anxiety and sometimes gets into states of depression.  
My sisters and I are not close - we speak a few times and year. Around 2018 my youngest sister mentioned that David and my younger sister Ana were spending a lot of time together. Last week I got a call from Ana letting me know that her and David had discussed getting engaged and married by the end of the year. I haven't spoke to David in years. I called my youngest sister and asked if Ana knew about our mom and David sleeping together - she told me she never told anyone but me and was not planning on telling anyone else.   


Is it even my place to say anything? I don't know if David told her?  
I have kept my distance from my family since I have hurt them so much and now I feel if I speak up I could cause more damage.  


TL;DR - Dated my childhood friend David during high school/college - cheated on him and was a terrible person/girlfriend. Lied and manipulated my family and mom. Took advantage of my moms mental health issues. Ran away got my act together, got married, had kids, moved to Spain. During that time David and my mom had sex. Years later David and my younger sister Ana became very close and are dating. They want to get engaged and married by the end of the year. I don't think Ana knows David and my mom had sex. At this point I think myself, Ana, and my mom have had sex with David."
