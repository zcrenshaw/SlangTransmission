"TIFU: I have officially branded myself as the biggest perv... and I 100% deserve it...


This happened an hour ago, and I’m still shaking in fear about how my life will now become from now on....

There’s 2 “situations” that leads to the conclusion of the FU.

First situation:

Asked sister-in-law to borrow her 360 pocket camera for a trip wife and I are soon vacationing to.

Found out the memory card still had content.

Her husband travels a lot, and she made a 1-hour POV style 360 “porn” video, assuming sent to him a while back.

I’ve had the hots for her for the past 8+ years. Before she got married and I have, there were several times sexual tensions arose between the two of us. Living together for a year as strictly roommates, movies, dinners, getting drunk while watching movies just the two of us, breakfasts, etc.

A certain trust (or test?) was implemented and nothing ever happened between the two of us, as at the time I was dating my now wife which was working at a distance. But damn it at the time if she just had touched my hand once back then, I think I would have lived a whole different life.

So finding this video... I thought I struck gold, I could have what I’ve always fantasized about, “gifting my past self”, while living my happy current life.

Second accident:

I have an automated house that lights up the house with geolocation. Before the app worked with Apple HomeKit, a third party app needed to be downloaded which tracks your family and friends. Free version only allows you to add 1 person, so my wife.

Wife and I have had this app for 3 years now even if it’s useless now after an app update a couple years back on the original app. We never deleted it since it was so useful for tracking each other using notifications. I get a notification when she’s at work and when I arrive at work, we also both get notifications when one arrives home. Good for times where she does groceries for example and I get a notification to prompt me to go out and help her out. Or when I work late and finally leave the office prompting her to set-up the dinning table.

Last night she fell asleep without charging her phone. I hate when she does that, today she goes to work with barely any battery, what if she needs to call the police or hospital for an emergency?

I have the day off today, today was the day I’d do the “deed”. I don’t only go with simple 360 video.... but literally set it up on my VR headset in bed with AirPods on. The whole experience.

This would have lasted me tops 5 mins.

But the “foreplay” she does, is long and boring. Then the action starts and I go on.

Wife’s phone didn’t give a notification as she arrived, because of her now dead phone.

She comes to the bedroom to see me master bating in bed with VR goggles on.

She knows I masterbate occasionally but never saw me do it, I sneak it in here and there.

But VR porn was never “discussed” as an “is it cheating if....” thing. You know the convo I’m talking about, “is it cheating if you have a sex doll”, “is it cheating if it’s a robot”, “is it cheating if you put a pleasure toy on and someone from across the Internet strokes you in real time”, etc...

It was the type of convo we’d have at the very start of our relationship when we were still friends 10 years ago, to see how far one could take it. Weird I know, but let’s say it was one of these pre-game convos to see if we’re on the same page before things started getting serious. Pre-game convos were not only about sex by the way.

Anyways, VR wasn’t a “thing” back then so was never discussed. So I never knew if it was “right” or “wrong” for me to do so. I guess it was “wrong” since she rushed in and ripped the goggles from my face. That’s when I see her in the room.

“The fuck??” she says.

Then she looks inside.

“Is that my sister?!?!”

I’m fucked.

She still had her shoes on from arriving. So she just grabbed her bag WITH the VR headset and left the house.

Seeing from the tracking app... she’s at her parents house.... which are neighbours of the sister-in-law.

I’m fucked.

TL;DR: Masterbated in VR with sister-in-law’s 360 porn video, got caught in the act, now feeling out of body experience and don’t know what’s going to happen."
"TIFU by swiping on my girlfriend’s phone NSFW


So this happened a few days ago and I’m still not sure I’m 100% ready to tell the story but here goes.

I’ve been with my girlfriend for about a year and I already know she is the love of my life. She’s perfect for me. We’re perfect for eachother. We’re getting ready to move in with eachother and I want nothing more than to start a family with her and spend the rest of my life with her.

We went on a short vacation last week and when we returned she gave me her phone to look at some photos from the trip. 

She went to the bathroom while I had her phone, and as I was scrolling through the pictures it kind of jumped to a period that was about a year and a half ago. If you have an iPhone you know what I’m talking about, you scroll a little bit too fast and all of a sudden you’re back at the start of the photo album. It’s annoying as hell.

But some photos caught my eye. Some photos that I really shouldn’t be seeing, of her and a previous boyfriend.

There she is, the love of my life, TRYING to get her mouth around the biggest dick I’ve ever seen in my life. I’ve watched porn - a lot. I’ve never seen a dick like this. I’m talking bigger than 2 coke cans stacked on top of eachother. Longer and thicker. As far as I could tell she was unable to get her teeth around it.

I could see another thumbnail of her comparing the size of his dick to her forearm with a look of wonder and glee on her face.

I closed the pictures and I’ve acted like nothing has happened, but I cannot get these images out of my mind. I’ve never been self-conscious about my dick size - in fact if you believe the stats I’m significantly above average, but this has destroyed my self esteem.

We haven’t had sex since. I can’t concentrate on my work. I just wish I had never seen those damn pictures.

TL;DR accidentally saw some pictures of the love of my life sucking the biggest dick on earth and my stupid male ego is destroyed"
"TIFU by accidentally pulling out my GF's tampon while watching TV


 Yesterday evening my GF and i thought it would be nice to watch Lord of the Rings after coming home quite late. After aproximately 4 hours i was really tired and couldnt think straight anymore. She had her ""strawberry week"" so she was plugged, which I frankly didnt care too much about. We just came along the credits in the movie and i was casually stroking her ass when i realised there is a thread hanging somewhere.

I thought its just a random thread from the blanket, you know the ones hanging from some clothes.

I think it was muscle reflexes or something like this, my tired brain didnt think at all and i just pulled hard without realising of what i just did.

My girlfriend said: "" WTF are you do-"" and it was already out creating a mess everywhere until i realised what actually happened.

After explaining that i thought its from the blanket, my GF couldnt stop laughing and i felt quite ashamed. Made up the bed right after and went to sleep right next to my still giggling GF.

**TL;DR:** Accidentally ""unplugged"" my girlfriend while watching a movie creating a mess in my bed"
"Tifu by telling my gf to go right.


I finally get to post a fuck up. Happened an hour ago, still afraid for my life.

My gf and I were playing mario party 7 for the first time ever. Awful game by the way. Anyways, as most of you probably know, you can pick what direction you character travels around the map. The gf, in 3rd place with nearly 100 coins is making her way around the map.

The star was right in front of her at the crossroad. 

As she approached the crossroad to pick up the star, i sarcastically suggested she go right.

Which she immediately did.

I have never seen anyone so angry in my life, and I've worked both as nightclub security and loss prevention in my time. Nor have I ever been so afraid. She ended the game with 0 stars...

""I will kill you in your sleep"" she stated.

The rest of the game was spent in dread. Its now 3am and I'm hiding in the bathroom typing this while she makes serial killer noises.

Goodbye.

Tl;dr Mario Party 7 is a terrible game."
"TIFU by stripping in front of my girlfriends BFF's [NSFW]


It’s as stupid as it sounds.

Yesterday my girl had her weekly friends evening with her BFF’s. They usually come over to our flat and they drink, talk and watch movies.

Around that time I’m usually at the gym so to not disturb them. But yesterday, a friend of mine wanted to come along, so I went there an hour earlier.

Sometimes, after I come home from training, we have spontaneous sex, as she likes me being sweaty from the gym.
So, I come home early and hear the TV running and I assumed, that she didn’t hear me.
That’s when the dick-driven idiot part of my brain forgot about the fact, that she had girls evening and suggested to get rid of all clothes and jump her on the couch.

I busted through the door and...have more eyes on me than planned.
Her best friends stare at me in complete disbelief, nobody saying a word. Some get red and look away, some stare at me like they’ve never seen a mans private’s before and my girlfriend started to gasp, followed with more gasping and stumps of words and ending with a well deserved WTF. 

The silence after that was fucking killing me, but my girlfriend came to the rescue. I uttered a loud FUCK and she instantly replied with: „Good plan, bad execution.“ Her friends all laughed and even I had to smile at that, before fleeing the scene to get some clothes.

I even joined them after that, although still embarrassed. Of course my dick was the talk of the town, but they at least all took it with humor.

Tl;dr: Busted naked into my SO’s girl evening."
"TIFU by unknowingly doping for the entire school year


  

This TIFU has been the in the making since last September. This is a throwaway account, as my real one is known to my friends.

Late last summer I started having some heart problems; irregular heartbeat, high pulse and the works. Naturally my family doctor prescribed a daily 25mg tablet of metoprolol, which kept the symptoms to a minimum. I'm a pretty private guy, so nobody but my close family knew.

Though I’ve always been pretty healthy, that was the wake-up call I needed to start working out. Beside hitting the gym, I also joined a sharpshooting club, and was I was natural at it. Over the course of a few months I moved from shooting prone with a help of a few sandbags to shooting standing up. My aim was steady, breathing as slow as possible, heartbeat minimal.

I’m pretty sure you guys have already made the connection between the heart meds and my fantastic performance, but I sure as hell didn’t. In the mean time a cardiologist said “Tough shit” and pumped up the meds.

During the course of this school year I was consistently better than the other newcomers at sharpshooting, winning small tournaments in the club. Soon they decided to have me participate in a bigger tournament, with an actual prize. The stakes were high, but I was a stone cold shooter. Later that day checking out my Fitbit, I found that my pulse had never gone over 85, and that was when I had to bicycle over the the range.

Flash forward 2 more tournaments to today. My friend jokingly mentioned that I must’ve been doping to do so well and the dots connected. I googled “metoprolol doping”, there there it was. I still haven’t told anyone, but Reddit. What the hell do I do now?

TL:DR Started taking beta blockers for heart problems, joined a sharpshooting club and unknowingly won 3 tournaments by using a common doping drug."
"TIFU BY GETTING IN MY EX GIRLFRIENDS NEW BOYFRIENDS CAR


So this actually happened about a week and a half ago. Some pre knowledge. I dated my next door neighbor for about a year and a half, but then we eventually broke up. So the other day I was really hungry and wanted some Panda Express Orange chicken. I texted my friend to see if he wanted to go get some panda with me and he replied sure but that he wanted to drive because he had gotten a new car and wanted to surprise me with it. I was like “alright sounds good brother see you in a bit”. 
A couple minutes later a car rolls up in front of my house. So naturally I got went out and got in thinking that it was my friend. I got in and buckled and was ready to go when the driver looked over and said, “ummm you’re not my girlfriend,” quickly I looked up and realized “oh god I am in my ex girlfriends new boyfriends car. I started to unbuckle and get out. I opened the door and heard a thunk. Now I’m thinking to myself “oh god I just hit the door against the curb but when I looked up it turns out I actually hit my ex with the door. Quickly I apologized and got out and waited for my friend inside my house. 

TL;DR I got in my ex girlfriends new boyfriends car thinking that it was my friend. Then when I got out I hit her with the door."
"TIFU by not closing the tab of porn on my phone after masturbating.


Here we go. This happened yesterday in university. 

So, I wake up at 7 and I have two mid-term internal class tests from 8:30 to 9:30 and another from 9:30 to 10:30.

I brush my teeth and take a bath and go to my room to get dressed. As I am drying myself I pick up the phone to check time and it’s only 7:20 yet and I have good 30 minutes as breakfast plus travel only takes 40 minutes from my home to university and I haven’t had a good release since a week. 

I take my phone, sit on my bed, scratch my balls while searching PornHub. I take my time and find some videos and start doing my own rhythm. I am all into it and realise I have only 5 more minutes left. I give myself the dopamine and get dressed in a hurry. 

I reach university and the examination hall is already full. Here (India) you can only take your stationary, water bottle, calculator (scientific not programmable) and your Exam Registration. I take my stuff and enter the classroom. 

The invigilator signs me in and hands me the answer sheet and question paper. I go to my desk and as I am fumbling around for my pen, my hand senses the phone in my left pocket. I lose my shit and get all tensed up. 

I try to keep calm and switch it to Silent Mode and tell myself if I act normally I won’t get caught with it and will probably not get into any trouble. 

Soon after the Unfair Means Squad (They check if you have something to cheat) enter the class and go around checking for books or questionable stuff. I keep my head down and act like I have nothing. 

One of the female professors lands next to me and tells me to get up. I start sweating and I almost shit my pants. She tells me to empty my pockets and I take everything out and put it on the desk.

 She stares at me and picks up my phone. 

“You seem like a studious one. Why are you cheating?” She said. 

“I am not. It’s an honest mistake.” 

Then she asks me to unlock it so that she can check if I have any PDF or Browser open and says that if she finds nothing, she’ll let me go. 

My heart finally stops powering a jet and I place my finger over the fingerprint and it opens. 

My heart now starts powering a rocket as I recognise the black screen with a buffer between it. The video paused.  There’s nothing on the screen though. No image or thumbnail. 

“Cheating from a video?” She says and she clicks play button on the bottom left. 

There it is. Dani Daniels and Manuel Ferrara going at it. The sound of Dani Daniels screaming like a cat being strangled echoes through out the hall. 

The professor dropped my phone and had a face as if I was masturbating in front of her. 

Now I have failed Computational Mathematics and have to give a written apology to the Dean of Academics and Convenor of Examination. 

Anyway, one girl who was sitting somewhere around me asked which porn was it. Had to send the link. 


TL;DR : I forgot to close my porn window after masturbating. Accidentally took my phone to the examination hall where it wasn’t allowed and thr professor caught me. She checked the phone and the porn plays at full volume in the hall with 70 people sitting in it."
"TIFU by cripwalking out of my maths class


No, isn't a joke. This happened less than 2 hours ago.

So you might be wondering, how in the fuck did I manage to cripwalk out of my maths class? Why on earth would I do it? Well, let me tell you. Here I am, chilling in class, while we're doing simple quadratic formulas, and one of our classmates could not even comprehend HOW to count it. My teacher, of course, gets pissed, and then she catches a student chatting, which led her to losing her shit. She starts saying how we all copy our answers when doing work, and tells us that if we don't enjoy the class, we can exit the room, pointing to the open door.

I sat there hesitating for about a few seconds, thinking ""Should I? Nahh"" and then thought: it's the end of the year, nothing will happen and everyone would get a good laugh out of this! Maybe. But not the teacher.

So I get up, put my books in my bag while everyone is giving me confused looks (including the teacher), and I shit you not, I cripwalk out the door, closing the door on the way out. As soon as I'm outside the classroom, the whole class is fucking HOWLING, literally screaming, you could even hear it from the first floor.

I'm feeling all slick and shit thinking ""That was definitely worth it"", but then it fucking dawns on me. **The parent-teacher conference is today, in less than 3 hours. AND I HAVE TO GO TO IT TOO.**

&amp;#x200B;

*Yeah, I'm fucked. Please pray for me*

&amp;#x200B;

**TL:DR** \- I tried to be funny by cripwalking out of my maths class when my teacher offered us to leave the classroom and the parent-teacher conference starts in less than 3 hours now. RIP me"
"TIFU by thinking my wife was being sexy


 

This happened yesterday morning. Just a short and sweet TIFU.

Yesterday morning I hop out of the shower and see my wife in the bathroom finishing brushing her teeth. She's wearing her robe with just her birthday suit underneath. She turns towards me as she puts down her toothbrush and I get the full (and amazing) view of her from the front. Naturally, I walk over to get a little touching in as our son is downstairs playing some vids before we head out for the day.

I start caressing her leg as she leans over into my ear and whispers ""stick your finger gently in my pussy.""

BOOM! Near instantly hard and I obey her wishes, especially ones like that. I slide my middle finger gently up there as she said and it's already extremely wet, so we're definitely about to get a quickie in before we leave. This time, I whisper back, ""why are you so wet already?""

Expecting a sexy, hot response back she whispers, ""I'm on my period"" and starts bursting out laughing. Of course, I pull out my finger which is now covered in blood that's beginning to drip down the palm of my hand.

I walked away as she nearly died of laughter to wash my hands. No sexy time happened. 

TL;DR - Wife played a prank by pretending her period blood was her being wet and horny."
"TIFU by leaving my Facial Cleansing Brush in my boyfriend’s parents bathroom


This happened 2 weeks ago and I’ve only just stopped cringing entirely when I think about it.

My boyfriend and I were visiting his (quite conservative) parents house for the weekend. I took a shower, and I remember feeling really smug because I remembered to bring all of my cleansing stuff with me, including my new cleansing brush. For anyone that doesn’t know what it is, it’s literally a small handheld electronic contraption with a brush at the end of it, and does a better job of cleansing your face and leaving your skin smooth af than if you just used a flannel. 

After using it, I wrapped myself in a towel and was sorting out my shower bag when I had the amazing idea of detaching the brush from my cleanser, and leaving both parts on the windowsill to dry. It’s important to note that I had the contraption body facing away, towards the window, so you could only really see the handle and then the back of the ‘head’ of it.

Anyway, everything’s fine for a couple of hours - boyfriend and I are sitting in his bedroom when his dad knocks on the door, gives me a really shifty look and then asks for “a word” with my boyfriend. We both looked at each other weirded out, but my boyfriend obliged and went outside to the hallway.

After a few moments he comes back in a bit red in the face, sits down on the bed and says “why did you leave a sex toy in the bathroom?”  Obviously I was perplexed, saying I REALLY had no idea what he was talking about. He was embarrassed rather than accusatory, and explained his dad had briefly described it as “pink with a big bulb” and then it hit me.

I too, went bright red and laughed rather uncomfortably as I explained what it was. Unfortunately, I didn’t realise his dad was lingering outside the door still. 

“You don’t have to lie BloatedRabbit, it’s ok but just next time don’t leave it around for everyone to see.”

“I swear on my life it’s a face cleanser!” I said, rushing up and retrieving it with the brush attachment. I handed it over and he looked really sheepish and apologised, and we both had a bit of an awkward laugh about it. My boyfriend then decides to take the jokes up a notch and say how stupid his dad is, and how he’s a dirty old man for thinking like that. His dad got a bit defensive, and his response still makes me want to crawl into a hole and die when I think about it.

“Well I’m sorry, but it looks just like one of your mother’s toys!” 


I’m not religious at all, but when I say I wanted God to beam me up there and then... I’m not kidding. I felt like jumping out the window. The whole energy of the room shifted. His dad made a hasty retreat as my boyfriend stood there gobsmacked, and we didn’t dare leave the bedroom again for the next couple of hours.

Worst part was we had a family dinner that night, and his mum asked me about the facial cleanser and where to buy one. My boyfriend and his dad put their forks down at the same time. Talk about awkward.

TL;DR I left my facial cleansing brush on the windowsill of my boyfriend’s conservative parents bathroom. His dad found it, thought it was a sex toy, and when boyfriend took the piss he accidentally revealed it looked like one of my boyfriend’s mum’s toys."
"TIFU by joining my girlfriend’s sister in the shower


Long story short, my girlfriend (18) is getting her license next week so I have to pick her up to go to my house and drop her back off at her place (40 min round trip).

Last night I dropped her off at midnight and she wanted me to stay since I had work at 6AM and my workplace is down the street from her house.

My girlfriend and I regularly shower together at her house. She woke up and told me she was going to take a shower, and left the room, thinking I was going to sleep a little longer. To surprise her, I slyly walked into the bathroom and stripped naked. She was humming in the shower and I thought it’d be funny to scare her, so I opened to shower curtain, penor hanging loose, and yelled “surprise!!!” To my shock, it was her sister, and she screamed at the top of her lungs. I stood there for a second trying to process what was going on and just yelled sorry and ran out butt naked.

My girlfriend was in the kitchen and thought it was hilarious when I explained, but her sister and I haven’t made eye contact since and haven’t said a word to each other. Fml.

Tl;dr - walked in on my girlfriend’s sister naked in the shower thinking it was my girlfriend."
"TIFU by causing about 40 people to fall down an escalator at the airport.


Okay, it wasn't today but it was recent. That's all I can give you.

I was at a UK airport and as a perk of my job I had a business class ticket to fly to Brazil. I'd never flown first class before and felt pretty giddy and excited, i mean, why wouldn't I?

I was going to Brazil, for 3 weeks, busines class in a five star hotel I hadn't had to pay for. To make it even better as it was technically a business trip I was getting paid to be there.

I'm heading to the departure gate and I ended up on one of those long escalators, you know the kind they have in airports that you silently note to yourself ""hey, that's a big escalator.""

I'm going down, got my backpack on, my headphones in and I'm in a good mood, such a good mood I decide to jump the last few steps, just because I'm a little giddy thinking about all those Brazilian girls, some sunshine, some cheap booze and absolutely NO stuffy office and intolerable moody co-workers.

So i jump, hit the plate at the bottom and the fucking thing locks up and makes a high pitched noise. It doesn't gradually come to a stop, it just stops. 

It's a busy airport, it's a busy escalator too. I turn around and see people tumbling down this thing, crashing into people and more people falling. An alarm goes off and people in uniforms come running out shouting into walkie talkies.

I try my absolute best to disappear into the crowd, another shocked bistander wondering what's going on.

I see a lady bleeding from her nose, a man with a probably broken arm, kids crying and I know it's my fault. I feel horrible, but not just horrible, worried. Worried i won't be going anywhere. What will work say?!

I head to the departure gate and bored my flight without issue, the business class is severely tainted. I spend the whole trip worried I'll be arrested at the other end, every possible scenario goes through my head.

I get off scot free but I'm still feeling bad about it so i thought I'd come and tell all of you about it, so you can judge me instead.

**TL;DR Don't jump the last few steps of an escalator**"
"TIFU by giving a dude head and texting my mom about it


This happened about 10 minutes ago.... 

I'm recently single living with my sister and her family. My mom and I talk every day, but I don't tell her about the dumb shit I do. Anyway, I've been spending time with this guy that's definitely bad news. He works a ton, but he's a goddamn mess. 

My mom knows that I've been ""seeing"" this guy because my sister told her. She interrogated me about it tonight. I tried to say good things about him because otherwise it reflects badly on me...

Anyway, dude and I are hanging out tonight drinking whiskey and beer. We have sex. I get off, but he doesn't. I decide to go down on him... and he fucking falls asleep. In. The. Middle. 

Obviously, I stop and text my best friend about it. Except I text my mom and say ""he fell asleep with his dick IN MY MOUTH"" 😩😩😩😩 Immediately text her back saying that wasn't meant for her... 

So, she's going to wake up tomorrow, to go to YOGA, and see how I had some drunk dudes dick in my mouth who passed out. I don't know if she'll be more upset that I text her in the middle of the night or that I'm apparently so shitty that dudes pass out on me.... 

TL;DR told my mom that a dude passed out with his dick in my mouth"
"TIFU by getting my whole family mega high on edibles for 48 hours over CHRISTMAS


So as the title says this wasn’t today, it all started on Christmas Eve. I’ll set the scene, it’s Christmas Eve at my family home with my parents, brother, sister, my gf and my brothers gf. All of us are in our early 20s, besides my parents who are mid 50s. They have never had a problem with us smoking weed and would do it with us on occasion. A few months before, me and my gf had made a batch of edibles and got pretty high off them but nothing too crazy. So on Christmas Eve I thought it would be a great idea to make a new batch of similar strength and get the whole family high as we are rarely all together as all us kids are at different universities. So I start making the edibles but I can’t remember exactly how much weed I used in the first batch. I had 6 grams on me and used it all as there was 7 of us so nothing too crazy, or so I thought. Now when we made the first batch me and my gf cut the brownies into 12 pieces and only ever had 1 at a time. However my mum has a fancy brownie maker which cuts them for you into 9 pieces. So straight away I knew these would be a bit stronger than before but still I didn’t think they would be that strong, boy was I wrong. So I finish baking the brownies at around 2pm on Christmas Eve and the family descends on them like a plague of locusts. Half an hour goes by and no one is feeling anything. Mum is just about to serve up dinner, we had it early as we knew no one would be able to make it later. We sit down to start eating and then one by one we start to feel it. My dad, who has a history of passing out after smoking weed, finished his dinner in a matter of seconds and crawls off to the sofa as he “can’t stand up” and needs to “lie down”. So off he goes and about 15 minutes later we finish our dinner and go to see where he has got too. We walk into our lounge to discover him already asleep on the sofa. So about 20 more minutes go by and we are all feeling pretty high at this point. My mum starts freaking out and saying she “doesn’t like this at all” and needs some way to stop the high. I tell her that there is no way to stop it and to just ride it out. After about another 30 minutes my dad suddenly gets up from the sofa like he’s the Undertaker and dashed off to the kitchen as he “needs more food”. He then proceeds to make about 15 slices of toast for everyone to eat as well as about 5 for himself. At this point we realise that no one has wrapped any presents yet and my 85 year old grandmother is coming round for Christmas tomorrow. So we hastily try to wrap some presents but no one really gets anything done as by this point no one can even stand up anymore. Now me and my brother are seasoned stoners but even we can’t move more than 2 steps before falling to the floor and needing 15 minutes rest to get up again. We decide that the only thing we can do is to try and sleep it off and hopefully we feel better in the morning. So after a while of all 7 of us struggling up the stairs we finally make it into our beds and try to sleep it off. We all wake up on Christmas Day still whacked out of our minds and not able to function properly. We then realise that we have to go and pick up my brothers friend up who is joining us for Christmas but none of us are in any state to drive. So, after explaining to my grandmother that none of us can drive to pick up the friend as we are all too high to move, we had to call an Uber to bring the friend to us which cost a small fortune as it was Christmas as he was about 25 miles away. So we soldier on through Christmas all of us trying to just not be high anymore and we finally make it to the end of the day still high as a kite. We go to sleep and wake up the next stay and guess what, we’re still high as fuck. I genuinely thought it would never end but eventually later that day we all started coming back down to planet earth. So yeah, I ruined Christmas by getting my whole family too high to move.


TL DR: I accidentally made my family a crazy strong batch of edibles and ruined Christmas"
"TIFU by playing porn on the TV at work


Pretty short story, but so embarrassing.

Happened 3 days ago. I work as a receptionist for a small, but busy office, and we have a TV that I frequently change channels to entertain those in the waiting room. So, the other day it was FULL, all seats taken (about 30 people), and i noticed a few children looking bored and annoying everyone. (I'm at an angle to where to can't see the TV unless I stand up and lean over the desk). So, I grabbed the remote and began flipping through the TV guide when i came across ""Big Mama's House"". Haven't watched it personally, but i remember growing up hearing about how funny it was. So I thought ""Oh great, a funny movie everyone here can enjoy"", and hit ""SELECT"" on the remote. When I hit ""SELECT"", I sat down immediately...

I have never heard such a loud and in unison ""OH MY GOD!"" in my life. I started panicking and jumped out of my chair thinking something has happened with one of the patients waiting, but I was wrong, so so wrong. When I noticed everyone looking up in the same direction, covering their children's eyes, and yelling, I saw that this wasn't ""Big Mamas House"" starring Martin Lawrence. 

I turned off the TV so quick and sat down in such embarrassment that I couldn't make eye contact with any of these people. My boss was well aware of what had happened and apologized to everyone since all adult channels should be blocked. She later spoke to me after we closed and told me not to worry about anything, since it was not my fault that it wasn't blocked.

Still so embarrassing.

TLDR; Changed the channel at work thinking i was going to play a comedy movie for everyone in the waiting room to enjoy. Was porn instead."
"TIFU by taking a nude photo on my wife’s phone


So my wife left her phone in the bathroom a few days ago and I saw it as I got out of the shower, so I did what any dumbass husband would do, I took ridiculously cheesy nude photos of myself around the house. Nothing sexual or anything. Just things like me eating cereal with my diving hood on and legs spread eagle for no reason, or me watering the plants willst my legs were unnecessarily too far apart and so on. 

We don’t really go out much and we have no friends in this country (we just moved), so I thought she’d find it really funny when she came home. 

Well, I went to work and forgot all about it completely. Fast forward to today. We’re at H&amp;M and trying to pay. My wife uses this member thing (I don’t really know exactly what it is. I guess you could be an H&amp;M member or something) that’s on an app on her phone and for some reason, the barcode just won’t scan! 2 people at the counter are trying everything possible. No luck. My wife gets the clever idea that maybe she should take a screenshot of the barcode, zoom in and enlarge it. Maybe it will work then. 

By this point, there’s a bit of a queue behind us, and the 2nd cashier has to give up and start getting this under control. She’s ringing up the lady next to us. Her kid’s basically watching our cashier basically frantically try to find some sort of solution whilst staring at my wife’s screen, and when my wife opens her photos, well,  20 incredibly unflattering naked photos of myself popped up, the cashier gasps loudly says “oh my god!”, and this little fucking kid shouts “he is naked mommy! That man is naked!!!” My wife’s a fucking tomato , a group of teenage girls behind us burst out laughing at the whole situation and my pits began sweating in ways I never knew my body was capable of. 

Anyway, my wife didn’t find those pictures as funny as she would’ve at home*, I scarred a child and won’t ever be going back to that particular branch ever again. 

I should be asleep, but I keep thinking about this and audibly groaning. Probably the most embarrassing thing that’s ever happened to me. 

Oh and we couldn’t find a solution about the app thing. She told my wife to do something online, but I was so embarrassed my brain shut off. 

**Tl;Dr: My wife unwittingly unleashed my unflattering nudes on a child and our cashier at an H&amp;M.**

* as I was typing this post, she’s laughing her ass off at the photos now, 12 hours later."
"TIFU by showing my mom her dad’s death certificate from +30 years ago.


So I know that sounds kinda bad, but let me explain.

So yesterday my mom took my grandma to go get a bank account and a debit card. My family and I came from Chile and my grandma is 71 so it was kind of a big deal to her. So big in fact that she decided to put some of the bank documents in her “important papers box.” When she saw me, she was so excited she just had to show me. At first I was like “Oh Lala (what We call her) that’s pretty cool!” and then I noticed this old-looking paper book looking thing. I asked her what it was. She grabbed it out of the book and told me it was the equivalent of a marriage certificate in Chile that had her and my grandpa’s marriage certified and any children born in that marriage as well. As she was flipping through it showing me the contents, there was a little yellow folded up sheet that kinda looked like my birth certificate, but it was yellow instead of aqua. So I asked her what it was and she unfolded it and told me it was my grandpa’s death certificate. It had his date of death and location. 

You see, I was born in 1994 and he died in 1985 and there aren’t that many photos of him so I barely know the man. He’s always just been a dead relative to me. I asked my grandma if she could leave that for me [when she passes in the future] and she told me that she would rather give it to me now so I can keep it. I was really happy because I like having that kind of stuff. When my family and I moved from Chile when I was 6, we practically left our whole history behind us and aside from what little my dad has, I barely know anything about my grandpa.the only things that I know about him are that he used to be the equivalent of a governor in Chile, at some point probably murdered some guy, and that he left my grandma a drunk and died on the streets at some point. I don’t really want to pry into the sensitive topics of my family history so that’s all I picked up on over the years.

Anyway, I take the book and certificate and put them in my safe along with my own legal documents. Eventually my mom comes home and she comes to my room, where my wife and I are just relaxing, to talk about something or another. After she’s done talking, I tell her “Look what Lala gave me to keep” because I was honestly excited. She looks at it and says “What is it?” And I open it up to show her her parent’s marriage certificate, and then her and her sisters registered as their children. It didn’t hit me there and then that this was the first time my mom had ever seen this, and as she’s flipping through it she sees her dad’s information and says “So he was born on March 15th…”

At that point I realized that my mom might’ve not know her dad as much as I thought. She’d tell me stories from before he left how he’d take her to all these government buildings and get her nice dresses and stuff so I made assumptions like anyone else would. She seemed kinda mesmerized by it and then I told her “Here, take a look at this.” and handed her the death certificate. She looked at it and just kinda stared at it. Then she started crying, not sobbing, but just tearing up and crying looking at the piece of paper in her hands.

Then I put two and two together and came to the realization that she never knew exactly when her dad died. Just that one day he left, and then one day she was told that he was found dead on the side of a street after another night of drinking in a completely different city. But this certificate…it was real. It was accurate down from a year but to a day of a month to the hour and the minute when he was declared dead.

I felt horrible and immediately went and hugged my mom and tried to console her. He died over 30 years ago but I felt like I had been the person that told her that her dad was dead. 

Some say that ignorance is bliss or that closure brings peace to people, but all I know was that in that moment I was the one making my mom cry.

Eventually my mom left the room and silently went to bed and my wife, who had watched the whole encounter in silence, didn’t say anything but I felt terrible nonetheless.

Tl;dr: Made my mom cry by showing her her dad’s death certificate."
"TIFU getting caught masturbating at work.


As you may already be judging me by the title, I already know how bad this sounds.

Working my job I have a lot of walking around our huge building to do. Sometimes if I have even the slightest mildly erotic thought and the blood goes straight to my junk and DOES NOT go.. not matter how hard I try to think of hideous things. 

To solve this problem and not seem unprofessional or revolting or even get done for sexual assault, I go to jack off in the toilets. I do this usually maybe twice a day. 

Well today I forgot to lock the toilet door, I was in the motions of doing the deed when none other that the company director walks in (probably needing the bathroom) and catch’s me, I had no time to react and let go of my private’s immediately but I obviously had a raging boner.

He left immediately and waited outside to have a word with me, I was told to take the rest of the week off and have a meeting with HR next Wednesday... am expecting the worst, I just hope it’s not illegal what I did as I meant no harm to anyone.

TL:DR  TIFU I got caught pumping the turkey neck in the work restroom, suspended with pay for the rest of the week."
"TIFUpdate: Getting Caught Masturbating to Myself


 

Original post: [https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/boznue/tifu\_by\_getting\_caught\_masturbating\_to\_myself/](https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/boznue/tifu_by_getting_caught_masturbating_to_myself/)

So I woke up to a text from my girlfriend in the morning telling me to call her once I'm awake. She's an early bird so I kinda expected this. So I called her and said I wanted to talk about what happened last night. The call was slightly awkward at first but we decided to meet up to talk about it.

She was actually quite understanding about all this and we ended up opening up a lot about our sexual fetishes and stuff. Told her it was just a passing moment kinda thing and although this isn't a lie, she assured me that it would be totally fine if it wasn't a passing moment.

Long story short, she took it well enough and this fuck up ended not being a fuck up and actually benefited me in some way. Looks like my sex life has gone from vanilla to kinky pretty damn quick. I'll spare the details ;)

And no, she didn't and won't tell anyone so my dark secret is safe with her and hundreds of strangers who read my original post.

Some of you have also been asking me for pictures. Guys, in case you haven't realized, this is a throwaway and it's a throwaway for a reason so.... I'd rather not share my embarrassing pictures online where some of my Redditor friends lurk around. In fact, i actually changed some tiny details of the original story just so that they won't realize it's me if they do come across this TIFU.

HOWEVER, if this post or the original post reaches the front page, I MIGHT reconsider. (Things I do for karma huh... and it's not even my main account)

TL;DR - Fuck up turned into a fuck yes. Anyone asking for pictures gets a fuck off, at least for now."
"TIFU and gave my dad herpes


Let me preface this by saying I did not fuck my dad. I think the rule is 3 pumps right? Kidding, anyways.. 

I’ll start by saying I am in a very religious family, or at least my parents are, where they believe nobody should have sex until marriage. Fair enough, I guess. I, on the other hand, do not believe that. 

My parents immigrated to Canada when I was very young so we grew up very different. 

So I was the first daughter in the family to go to college. It’s not necessarily a huge accomplishment but for my family it is, as females generally do not attend school (rarely even high school) where I am from. 

So I go to college and it’s not like I’m racking up the kills, but I experiment a little as I was very shy growing up. I also learned that I’m supposed to shave my pubic hair? I never was comfortable talking about sex with my friends growing up so it was news to me.The guy actually didn’t make a big deal of (what my close friend referred to as a bush) it but acted surprised so ended up talking about it. Anyways I started shaving my pubes no big deal. 

I continued to be somewhat promiscuous and a one night stand turned into be me getting herpes. Awful, but the medication I take now really suppresses my symptoms and makes it very unlikely to pass it to others. Apparently not. 

Let’s skip to me coming home for Christmas during my 3rd year at school. A boy I had a crush on in high school was going to be at a party I was going to. I was given somewhat late notice and only had a couple hours to get ready. I figure who knows what’s going to happen, but I’ll give all my areas a good touch up. 

I realize I don’t have any razors at home so I use a disposable one of my father’s. FUCK I’m rushing and I cut myself a little. I go to the party, we don’t hook up, no big deal. 

A couple months go by and I get a Skype call from my mom (she refuses to get an iPhone). She’s hysterically crying and she’s moving back to our home country. My parents are getting a divorce. I have no idea what happens but she gets interrupted with another call and says she’ll call me back. 

My parents have been together since they were both 18 and I’m freaking out. I FaceTime my dad. He answers and his face is covered in a rash. He’s telling me he has herpes, but he never cheated and has no idea how this happened. We talk for awhile and I’m confused and mad and don’t know what to believe. 

It takes me 2 full weeks to realize this could have been me. By this time my mom has actually flown home to stay with her sister. I start googling things and realize this is a possibility, and that the herpes could have been dormant so he didn’t have symptoms instantly. 

The dilemma: There’s a lot of moving parts to this. My parents do not think I’m sexually active and it would be a big disappointment to admit this let alone say I have herpes. Maybe my dad cheat I don’t know. Ok he didn’t cheat fuck I have to tell them. 

Long story short, I tell them, my mom moves back and I didn’t entirely ruin my family. It took a lot more work than this makes it seem but that is how I gave my dad herpes.

TL;DR I gave my dad herpes by sharing a razor I forgot I left in our family shower."
"TIFU by getting a girl pregnant at prom


First off this FU didn't happen today it happened about a month and a half ago. However I didn't find out until yesterday.

Second I'm on mobile so sorry about the formatting

Third a little bit of backstory. I'm 16 and a sophomore in highschool. Every year a bunch of schools in my area put on a giant prom with around 2,000 students. Me and a group of friends had gone last year and I really enjoyed it. I was super excited for this year and had been preparing for a long time, as it was a big event. Now I've never been much of a womanizer. I've had a few close female friends, but have never had a girlfriend and haven't even had sex. My parents are conservative Christians so I'd be in big trouble if they every found out. Anyway I never really had any intention to have sex that night but things don't always go the way we plan.

Me and my best friend end up carpooling to the event. He's 19 and graduated the year before, but they allow alumni to go 1 year after graduation. It was his last year so we were planning on a lot of fun. When we get there he introduced me to a few friends I hadn't met yet. One of them was a girl who had gone to our school for a few years now but I had never really gotten to know. She's a 10/10 and literally every guy in the school has a crush on her. Now I'm not a bad looking dude but Im also realistic so I don't think I've much of a chance with her. But long behold we hit it off and find out we have a lot in common. I think my luck is starting to turn as she's being quite flirty which is rare from her. She's never really been known to make sexual advances on guys and rejects almost all of them. She had one boyfriend back in middle School but they broke up on bad terms. Anyway at the need of the night we wants some peace and quiet so we head over to the hotel across the street and go to her room. Now like I said I had no intention to have sex. It's not that big a deal to me I know the dangers all to well (a good friend got a girl pregnant and it majorly screwed up his life). I was planning on just having a bit of a chat, Getting her number than heading home. She apparently has another idea. She starts coming on to me pretty hard. She says she's never had sex before, but she really likes me and thinks it'll be fun. Now I have nothing against sex and am kinda turned on at the moment. I don't have a condom on me at the time, but, like any guy during his first time, I'm already too far gone and think, ""fuck it it won't hurt to hit it raw"". But boy was I wrong. It last about 20 minutes, I came, we cuddle for a few minutes and then I realize I need to get home.

 Over the next month or so I don't think much about it. Me and her hang out a few times, but I'm focused on finishing up the school year so I didn't see her too much. No one knew that we did it either as we both wanted to keep it on the down low. She's got Christian parents as well and if either of our parents found out it might slip that we went to the hotel prom night. Anyway School got out last Friday. So I don't have a care in the world I'm planning on getting a group together to see detective Pikachu. When I get a text from her. She says she needs to see me and that it's kinda important. Im a little curious  as to what's the big deal but tell her that I'll be gone for the evening with some friends. She calls and says the she needs to see me right away, it also sounds like she's crying. I'm pretty sure it's important so I put all plans on hold and tell her to meet me at a park near both our houses. At this point I'm really curious as to what's going on. She shows up around 10 minutes after I do. She's obviously been crying so I ask her what's wrong. She says she's pregnant. She then burst into tears and tells me about how her parents will be disappointed and she doesn't know what to do. I tell her it's going to be all right and we'll figure this out. Me and her are the only ones who know. We sat around for an hour or so completely silent and tell her she needs some rest and we'll work it out tomorrow.

This morning she calls and says she's planning on telling her parents but wants me to be there I'm headed to her house in 30 minutes or so. I have absolutely no idea what to do

TLDR: I got a girl pregnant at prom and have no clue what to do"
"TIFU by telling my son his butt has a crack


This happened last week^tm.

Bath time at the Vacuum house is family time. We have three boys, a subset of whom often bath together in the garden tub in our master bathroom. The tub is often full of small toys, like boats, cars, and action figures, since the kids like to play a bit after getting cleaned up. 

My youngest (4) was horsing around in the tub with one of his older brothers - standing up, kicking, sloshing, the usual. Just as I was reminding him that this sort of behavior usually ends painfully, I see it. The look. That sudden interaction with gravity that widens the eyes and sends the arms flailing. I was helpless to save him, and I knew the math - the odds were long that he’d miss a toy when he landed. 

While the culprit was never identified, some hatchimal or hot wheel caught him right in the butt, and it based on his reaction, it was... unpleasant. While I was trying to console him, and make sure it didn’t hit anything TOO sensitive, the dad in me saw an opportunity too good to miss. 

“Let me check your bottom - Uh uh, there’s a crack!”

He obviously didn’t get the joke, and became even more distraught. Try as I might to convince him I was joking, that his butt always looked like that, that his brother’s butt looks like that, that my... well, he was not to be consoled. Days later, he’s blaming various ailments on his cracked butt. We live in fear that every stranger we meet will be the next to learn of his shocking injury. My wife’s eyes have still not stopped rolling. 

TL;DR - I told my 4 year old his butt had a crack, and he believed me"
"TIFU by finding my Girlfriends dildo.


 So this isn't a recent thing but is something I've always had conflicting thoughts about the past few years and needed a second opinion.

My GF at the time (currently my ex) was my first, in terms of a real relationship and not just sexually. We understood each other on a different level to which I had never experienced before and it was truly great. That is, everything other than the sex. She had an extremely low sex drive which I think came about after she started taking birth control at the start of the relationship (otherwise she **was** very active). At the start, we were going like rabbits, but after the hormones from the birth control hit we were having sex once or twice a month, it depleted to nothing over time. This took its toll on me as I didn't feel appreciated, but I understood the circumstances and didn't resent her for it, just science. I would occasionally perform oral on her but it was never returned. This was a three-year relationship whereas everything else was perfect, but it started to feel one-sided. I grew extremely insecure, thinking my penis was too small or that I was doing something wrong and couldn't turn her on.

I'd talk to her about it (as we were an honest and open couple) and express my concerns but she would always confess her love for me and felt extremely bad for not being able to *want* to have sex. She assured me there was nothing wrong with my penis and that she was just never in the mood. Not her fault. I get it, so I just sucked it up and moved on.

That is, until one day at her house I dropped something on the floor (maybe my phone or something IDK) and reached below the bed to retrieve it. Whilst scrambling through the mess that was her storage, conveniently placed in arms reach, I come across a dildo. But this wasn't just a regular dildo, this was homemade, and this thing was **huge.**

Easily 10'' and girthy. Myself, I'm not small, but I'm certainly not *that* big. Finding this broke me and my already present insecurities skyrocketed.

For a two year relationship of little to no sex with someone who claimed to have no sex drive, finding proof that she masturbating threw me. Not only was she sexually active at times, but she was doing it with a 10'' dildo that she personalised herself. She knew I was desperate for any affection and it genuinely broke me. I felt worthless. I resented the size of my penis and to this day, still, don't feel like it's enough.

Don't get me wrong, I have no problem with masturbation because we all need alone time. I don't think I would have even found a problem with a regular dildo, it would have raised questions but I know they come in set sizes so I would have just asked her about it. But this was a homemade dildo, personalised to be much bigger than mine and I just felt lied to. Clearly, I wasn't doing it for her but you'd have thought she would have at least shared the experience or told me if I was doing something wrong. Is that selfish of me to assume? I was just desperate for love.

Either way, I asked her about it and she didn't really have anything to say, she knew I was hurt and tried to express her affection for me but it fell on deaf ears. I just couldn't believe anything she said, all her compliments felt like lies and I've never taken a compliment seriously ever since. She might have meant them but my insecurity levels were so high I refuse to believe anyone anymore. Was I being dramatic? Was it wrong of me to take it that way? Was it a reasonable reaction? How can I move on from this?

We broke up not long after as I was working away and she couldn't 'live with the distance'. Funnily enough, she got in a relationship with my best friend a week after. I have suspicions she was cheating on me whilst I worked away from home. My heart was torn out of my chest, stomped on and discarded all at the same time. 

Honestly, I just want to get over it because it's still affecting me to this day. 2 years later. I just can't accept the fact I'm ever enough for someone and felt like I wasted 3 years of my life. I know I shouldn't feel this way and just want advice. Girls, I'd appreciate any insight.

Edit: I have no reason to believe she was cheating on me the rest of the time we were together, just the time I was away with work. This was a two month period towards the end of our relationship whereas we were with each other every day prior. 

TL;DR: Was in a relationship for 3 years with a girl that had no sex drive, found a giant homemade dildo, became increasingly insecure, we break up and she dates my best friend a week later."
