"My gay son is better but my wife has gone really bad


She and a few of her friends opened a small website for women's shoes collections a few years ago. She loves it. Her friends however decided they no longer want to work with her because her son is gay. And now they terminated her from her position. She quit her main job and now she got kicked out of here. She is really depressed. I can't say I am not sad either. Ever since our son came out we have been totally cut off and ostracised from every single one of our friends and family members. My sister passed me on the street and didn't even look at me the other day. But I am doing it for my son. So I manage to accept it somehow. My wife on the other hand has always been very social and she has gone really depressed these days. Like big time. She works from home as a translator but she quit her main job in the legalization translation of documents. 









I tried to get her to apply to teach at the language highschool in the city. She used to teach Russian there for like 15 years. But she says she doesn't want to be made fun of by the students and her co workers. I am really worried about her. She doesn't seem to accept our son's sexual orientation either. I have tried explaining it to her but you can imagine what 15 years of life in Saint Petersburg did for her ""understanding"" of gay people. It's so hard. "
"My 91 year old grandma just told me she couldn't wait to meet my BF


This isn't really a question, I'm sorry. I just got off the phone with my grandma after she recently found out I was gay and had a BF, and she told me that she couldn't wait to meet him and that next time I see him that I should give him a hug from her. I'm kind of tearing up a lot. I'm not sad, I just can't help but think of what it would be like to live in a world where everyone is just genuinely happy for us for loving who we love."
"Im Proud to be brown and gay


Lots of people are mean to me because of my skin colour and because of my sexuality and I just want to say I don't care I'm proud of what I am and if anyone has a problem with me they can tell me and I'll deal with them as I see fit"
"Is America ready for a gay President?


So I watched Pete Buttigieg's CNN town hall yesterday and I was really impressed by him. I don't know how this guy flew under my radar. He's definitely the dark horse in this race. He just seems so articulate and likeable. And the man is clearly intelligent and capable, he's a harvard graduate and rhodes scholar. Speaks multiple languages. Seems well informed on all the issues and he's also a veteran. Pete has definitely moved into my top choices for 2020, if not *the* top choice. I think this guy is so impressive even homophobes would have hard time holding his sexuality against him. And if nothing else, him running would at least normalize the idea of a gay president and make it easier for the next person. What do you guys think?

Some clips of last night's CNN town hall:

"I just ran out a grindr situation


This guy takes me to motel 6 and smokes crack... He went to the restroom and I was like ‚ÄúI have a phone call to take‚Äù and ran so fucking fast üò©"
"He put his tongue IN my ear!


So a month ago I was hooking up with some guy off Grindr. We were making out, kissing each other‚Äôs necks, nibbling each other‚Äôs ears. Generally normal stuff. When suddenly, he just shoves his tongue deep inside my ear and works it around in there. And naturally, I‚Äôm in a state of shock, because who fucking expects *that* move? 

But at the same time I‚Äôm overcome with the most bizarre and intense pleasure. It feels like he‚Äôs directly eating out my brain. It‚Äôs like ASMR but real and about 20 times more intense. And it was so unexpectedly intimate. Like after he stopped I felt kind of embarrassed.

So now I fucking hate this guy, because he introduces me to the world of *auralingus* and then drops off the face of the earth. So I‚Äôm left with what I can only assume is a fairly uncommon fetish. One which I can‚Äôt perform alone and which seems too weird to like ask any random Grindr hookup to do to me.

So yeah. Try getting your ears tongue-fucked. It‚Äôll complicate your sex life.

*Apologies that this isn‚Äôt a question.*"
"Any gays that pass for straight and find it difficult to casually bring up their sexuality?


Just what the title says.  I have recently gotten to know a lot of developers after going through a coding bootcamp and I have met a lot of new people and have made some new friends and plenty of acquaintances.  I also tutor and TA for my school now.  I think maybe 3 people of all the new people I've met over the past year know I'm gay, and it's largely because I rarely talk about my relationships and when I do mention having dated, I usually just say something cowardly like ""people I've dated"" or ""my ex blah blah"" then switch the subject because I don't want the focus of the convo to suddenly shift to my sexuality.  It's not that I am afraid anyone is homophobic.  I'm in a really liberal city.  I'm just awkward I guess and have gone my whole life just being comfy having people find out by hearing something or I'll just mention a ""he"" when talking relationships once I've started opening up to someone more, but that can often take awhile.  I've always been rather anxious.  Anyone else experience this?  "
"I followed the given advice and came out to my parents


I wrote about it- my boyfriend and I are thinking about getting married but I was still in the closet cause I didn't want to lose my family. I came out to them, went to their place and did it. It went as expected. They have disowned me completely. My dad literally kicked me out. My brother called me a few hours later to yell at me and told me never to come close to his family(kids and wife). I tried calling my sister but she didn't pick up. I tried to chat her up on facebook and she blocked me. Yesterday life was going good. And today and for the future life is SHIT."
"Is anyone else hard all the time around their SO?


Sitting next to them? Probably hard. Making out? Hard. Sex and climax? Still hard. Shower afterwards? Hard. Spooning and falling asleep? Still hard. 

I'm almost self conscious about it... I'm 26 so I guess it's better than starting to have problems getting it up but it's annoying "
"As a gay guy, what's the straightest thing you've done?


Mine is probably going through a phase of studying lot of women's arses and concluding that their shape in general isn't nearly as nice as the male arse shape."
"Anyone else prefer to suck dick rather than have their dick sucked?


I'd say I'm more of a vers top but I WAY prefer to suck a dick rather than have mine sucked. Any other guys like that?"
"Are we birds on Grindr?

"Anyone like when guys are just shirtless?


I like dicks and butts and stuff but something about a guys wearing shorts but without a shirt on is hot. Either skinny/chubby guys, doesn't matter. I get really turned on when I don't have a shirt on, but not really in the shower or anything. I wish I had a more fit body that guys would like though lol"
"Unpopular opinion: Grindr is not as toxic as this sub makes it out to be


Sure, it can be not great, there are racists, and you get ghosted and randomly blocked, but let's be real: it's a hookup app. 

Its purpose is to let guys meet for cheap casual sex. It shouldn't be used to make friends or dates as a primary purpose. 

It shouldn't be the focal point of your social life *at all,* and if your social life revolves around it to such an extent that you blame an app for being toxic, you're part of the problem. "
"Finally left my abusive relationship


About five months ago I wrote this post:

https://www.reddit.com/r/askgaybros/comments/9kk2r0/heart_is_breaking/

Long story short, I didn‚Äôt end up actually leaving. I stayed behind and talked with him and promised me he would change and go to therapy and just be n all around great guy. He was, for about two months..

Then it all started again, except this time it was worse. I honestly felt like I couldn‚Äôt even breathe in his direction without setting off a trigger to tear me apart. 

So I left, for good this time. I took the dog and I found my own place. I‚Äôm devastated though. I can‚Äôt stop thinking about how upset he‚Äôll be. I also don‚Äôt know when I‚Äôll feel ok. 

The worst part is he is looking for me. I had to block him and tell my family to as well. He keeps calling my office, he texted my mom and threatened to call the police on me. I just feel like I‚Äôm living a nightmare. "
"My dads a dick


I‚Äôm 16 and I told him was gay in a big argument. One thing led to another and he was screaming (while drunk) at me for some stupid reason and I let it slip. He doesn‚Äôt know that I‚Äôm with my best friend who I‚Äôve been friends with since birth. But he knows and he just walked away and hasn‚Äôt said anything else. I live with my mom mainly but I also stay with him. They have joint custody but I‚Äôm worried about what he‚Äôs gonna do or say. He has violent behavior. Should I just avoid him till it calms down or what?"
