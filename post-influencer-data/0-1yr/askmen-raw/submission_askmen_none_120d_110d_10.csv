I walk my dog in the evening when I get home from work on a local trail. I frequently walk past women who are alone and act like I'm the next Ted Bundy. I get it, they're obviously in a vulnerable position, but what am I supposed to do to let them know I mean them no harm?"

6,"What's your favorite porn plot line?


Sexy, funny, sweet, whatever! Hit me with it.

Mine: Couple went on a ""game show"" where the boyfriend hid in a living room that had closets cut into the furniture with gloryholes. A grandfather clock, a coffee table, the couch. Other guys hid with their dicks poking out and the woman came in to figure out which one was her boyfriend's. After trying out several, to say it was her final answer, she had to make the dude cum. 

There were some high stakes for being wrong across multiple rounds. All the other guys would take her in a raucous orgy after 3 strikes. 

Fun but also weirdly erotic how they kept cutting to the boyfriend's reaction cam as he's watching her go to town on some other dude certain it's him."

Essentially, I've been on a 1st date with 2 different women. They both went very well. I know this may seem like a stupid question to some of you, but can I date them both for now?

And when I want to switch channels he wakes up instantly. And wants me to switch back to the original channel where he can fall asleep again."

13,"Men who chose to advance their careers at a young age at the expense of their social lives. How did it turn out?


I am 26 years old. About a year and a half ago, I took a promotion about an hour and a half away from all my family and friends where I knew nobody. My first full year in the job (at age 25) I made $90k and this year I am on pace to make about $105k. I've been able to pay off all my debt, shovel money into my retirement savings and still have excess to be able to afford basically whatever I want within reason and have an emergency fund while saving for a house.

Financial security is important to me as I saw my parents struggle with money when I was growing up. I want to advance my career while I can and make sure that when the time comes to start a family I can support them comfortably and I also want to be able to retire comfortably which is why I think starting young was important with compounding interest and shoveling money into my 401k.

I also travel a bit in my job and I think now is the good time to do it because I'm not tied down.

With that being said, I feel like I am missing out on a lot of things that people my age should be doing. I am able to get home on weekends fairly often to hang with friends, but I'm missing out on things like random Tuesday quizzos or going to watch the game with my boys. Dating has also been hard because I'm very busy and I work remotely so I dont meet local people at work.

I'm in better financial position than my friends are and I'm hoping that long term this grants me the ability to have some more fun.

But sometimes, I wonder, is it worth it? Should I focus more on my social life while I'm young and not worry about saving for retirement and money in general as much? For all I know I could die tomorrow or when I'm 40 and its all for nothing?

Just looking for perspectives of others who did what I did and what would you change and how it worked out long-term.

tl;dr chose to focus on career over social life at a young age where social life should be booming"

Me: Well son, think of babies like pie. You know how you have to bake pies in the oven right?   
Son: Yes dad.  
Me: Well, daddy has all the ingredients to make a pie inside of him. BUT, daddy can’t make a pie without an oven now can he?  
Son: No. But wait....so you mean you have pie ingredients inside you dad?   
Me: Yeah something like that son. Now you know how daddy said you need an oven to make pie right?  
Son: Yeah  
Me: Well, mommy is the oven son! All daddy does is take his pie ingredients and give them to mommy and she lets the pie (which is your little sister) bake, and in 9 months the pie baby will be finished.

16,"Guys how did you find something worth living for?


Guys I need your opinions, how do you find new passions? I've been so depressed for years and I cannot seem to find a thing I'm absolutely passionate about. I love to write but I cannot force myself to do that everyday and I do it by myself without people.. I've always held up my identity onto dating and relationships and feel worthless without that but don't really have anything that defines me. My day off is always staying in bed and feeling miserable and I don't have anything to take my mind off. Any tips?"
17,"How do I make/keep male friends without them becoming romantically interested/assuming I’m romantically interested?


Please forgive me if this comes off as brash, but I’m sincerely asking. 

Growing up I’ve always been around boys, so I kind of grew up like one. Obviously things got weird around puberty but even well into teenage-hood and adult-hood, I always find myself gravitating towards male friend circles.

I also have tons of female friends that I relate to of course, but I would say I make friends with more guys than most of the girls I know.

It sounds terrible but I often get hit on by my friends or asked out and it always ends terribly. I lose someone that I had a connection with and they have hurt feelings. I’ve asked my female friends advice, but they’ve just said to “just stick with girl friends” cause it “won’t change” but I think that’s ridiculous.

So, if you don’t mind offering some insight or help, how could a girl become genuine friends with you and do it in a way where you would just see her as a friend? 

Again, sorry if this seems rude or inappropriate to this sub, but I figure I should try."

22,"What do you do if a girl is mentally your perfect gf, but you aren't attracted to her physically?


Help, I need advice. 

I've been dating a girl for a year who is mentally my ideal partner. She is outgoing, drags me out of my comfort zone, gets excited about everything and somehow whenever we spend time together it turns into the whole day.

The problem is she is quite literally the opposite of my type. This manifests in that she is quite short, doesn't have a nice butt and most of all I don't really like her clothing style. Bear in mind she is not unattractive, just not my type.

I feel bad for being so superficial, but whenever i'm out and about I keep seeing girls that are my type which keeps reminding me that i'm not that attracted to this girl. 

But maybe I am being too perfectionistic. I keep worrying that if I go back to this girl i'll be thinking ""what if"". ""what if there's someone who's as fun as her but also is what i'm attracted to?"".

As a final important piece of information, we dated for about a year but we've broken up for a few months now. It's weird because we still spend a lot of time together and that is not awkward at all.

Therefore I want some outside advice. What would you do in this situation?"

Depressed, anxious and addicted to porn! Thats my 20s in a broad stroke. Barely any sexual experiences because I was too scared of being rejected and not good enough. Now however after a few years in therapy, having romantic relationships with women is becoming less frightening. But I'm still scared! I'd love to hear from guys getting into the game at an earlier age and how you went about doing it.

How did you deal with the anxiety and inexperience?"
25,"Guys, what were your reasons for rejecting a girl &amp; how do you show interest?


I'm 23(F) and I met this guy in one of my college courses last year. We really hit it off and had real conversations about everything, not just small talk. I'm not kidding, talked about everything under the sun...from things as chill as music suggestions to family stuff. In class he also acted very differently towards me than anyone else, though I feel now that this was probably just familiarity, but at the time I read too much into it. Stuff like saying my name/addressing me by my name in private conversation, lingering eye contact, raised eyebrows when he'd see me, seeking me out in a group, the shared 'look' when someone else says something stupid etc. Outside of class we often ran into eachother because there was some overlap, it got to the point we expected it and he'd come over and sit near me and we'd talk until we had to part ways. One night I skipped, and next time I saw him he asked where I was/said he missed me (not like gushy missed me just casual ""missed you there, what happened?). At the end of the semester, he took me aside and requested we stayed in touch/don't be scarce. He acted really playful and teasing, even hinted at getting my number but I was afraid I was wrong and we parted ways. No big deal, emailed back and forth so ridiculously often that numbers ended up being exchanged. Texted daily, throughout the day starting in the mornings...same conversation as before, but now with a few winky faces (his part) being tossed in and when we shared music sometimes they'd get really either NSFW or romantically inclined- again probably just me reading too much into it/hearing what I wanted to hear. ANYWAYS long story made not so short, I developed a crush and felt I had every reason to believe it was mutual. I casually told him I liked him, but didn't have any expectations. I just wanted him to know and if it was mutual then cool, and if not then that was okay too I really liked hanging out and talking with him. He was incredibly polite and very very considerate in his response, I was honestly floored since it can be scary risking the loss of a friend. He basically said that he simply didn't feel the same way, but that he liked hanging out and talking with me too, and that I'm an amazing and beautiful girl and it wasn't anything to do with me. I felt a little sad of course, but appreciated it. We kept talking, still talk, and things are all good (truly).   


That said, I've never dated anyone or admitted a crush before etc. I'm 23 and I've never so much as kissed anyone. This was, despite it being the best way to be turned down- was a huge blow to my confidence and hit me hard self esteem wise. I didn't tell him that of course, my intentions aren't to manipulate and this has nothing to do with him. He will never know so don't suggest asking him, please! We're still friends and I wouldn't want to cause any guilt, he's a nice guy. But yeah, this sucked and it still sucks. I feel hurt but not by him specifically, just in general. It makes me wonder what's wrong with me, or why nobody has seen me in a romantic or even sexual light. I'm not unattractive, but I'm not a model either. I'd say I'm average and can add some points if I wear makeup or dress it up a little. I'm not painfully shy, in fact I'm friendly and outgoing. I talk to people, generally make friends easily. Have numerous aquantainces. I'm still working on my neuro degree, but I feel that I have a lot to offer...I run my own small dog training business and I own my own house. My friends who are girls say I'm a catch, that I'm pretty and funny etc. but I feel like I'm not enough for anyone. That I'm missing something fundamentally, and maybe it's experience, but I just don't know how to fix this and I'm embarassed I read my friend so wrong!   


Guys, how do you show a girl you're interested? What are some signals that I couldn't possibly misread? If you've ever rejected a girl (I need a softer word- rejection sounds like I think you're a bad person for it, which couldn't be further from the truth), how come? Was your reasoning specific or just eh, wasn't feeling the spark? Give me your thoughts :(   
It's been a year since and I hate that it's still getting to me and affecting my confidence in trying again with someone new. Thank you in advance for any insight :)&lt;3"

Don’t get me started on sex. We’ve been together eight years, married for four. She acts like we’ve been married for twenty-five years. I don’t know what to do.
