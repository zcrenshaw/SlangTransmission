0,"What’s a fact that you just can’t wrap your head around/accept?


For me it’s the fact that people who are completely blind don’t see black, they just don’t see anything. 

Some people try explaining it by saying that it’s like trying to see out of the back of your head. While I understand what they’re getting at, my brain just can’t accept the concept of seeing nothing."
1,"What's the weirdest social interaction you've ever been part of?


For me, the cake definitely goes to that one time I was was told by a woman in line at the drug store, out of the blue, that she used to breastfeed me.

Explanation: I was in college and one weekend went back to my small hometown and ran some errands for my parents. Was in a drugstore and this woman that was roughly my mother's age came to me and started talking:

W: hey, are you by any chance u/h1l3e, son of (mom's name)?

Me: uh, yeah, do I know you?

W: you might not remember me, but (gets closer to me and whispers to my ear) I used to breastfeed you when you were a baby, because your mother didn't lactate.

Me:

W:

Me:

W: anyway tell your mother I said hi! See you around! "

3,"What's the best way you got back a roommate for having loud sex?


So I have mentioned this story before, but my roommate last semester was a man hoe. He would frequently bring girls back to the dorm even though he claimed he had a girlfriend. Anyways one night he brought a girl home who woke me up at 3am by screaming during sex. I consider myself to be a calm reasonable person so I did what any calm reasonable person would do. I got out my phone connected to the Bluetooth speaker in his room and played a [video](https://youtu.be/xFOeQDJjSos) about queefing at max volume. She shut up really quickly and my roommate told me they were so embarrassed they just layed on the bed listening to some girl explain queefs to them for five minutes. I slept like a baby after that.

5,"Men: How do you NOT glance at a woman’s chest when she’s wearing a revealing shirt?


Every. Damn. Time. Ever since I read a post asking women about it, I’ve learned they can see this glance every time. I’m not trying to stare these girls down, but as a salesman walking into an office, I try to keep eye contact 100% of the time, but when they’ve got the warlocks out, it’s impossible for me to not glance at least once.

Today as I was heading to the grocery store, my wife says ""Ooh, will you buy some pastrami?  It sounds really good.""  Jokingly, I replied with ""What do I get out of it?"" and she came up and whispered ""A blowjob"" in my ear.  I guess I know what my wife's price is now.  The funniest part is that I was already going to buy lunch meat, she only changed what kind I was going to buy."

I always feel guys don't pick up signals. I try  touch them on their arms and chest, look at their crotch and show off my leg or try to show off down my top, be flirty but it doesn't seem to work. 
Do I have to put my hand on their dick or something to show them?"

17,"Girlfriend(18?F) lied about her age. What would you have done?


So I've (19m) been with this girl for awhile now, we get along well and things were looking great until she told me something after lunch today.

After we finished our lunch at a relatively quiet restraunt she starts with, ""I have to tell you something but don't get mad"". I start warming up my mind to be level-headed as possible. With a poker face I listen, she tells me she's really 17 and was going to tell me when we celebrated our birthday together seeing how they're two days apart. I tell her calmly I need some time to think and left, she also leaves with a worried look. I didn't kiss her goodbye like I usually do because truthfully speaking, I am so fucking embarrassed right now. The fact that she said she wasn't going to tell me until 4 months later just leaves me with a significant amount of distrust. I broke up through a phone call 15 minutes after we parted ways.

The reason why she told me why she lied was because she didn't want me to think she was immature because of her age. I honestly think now she's childish as fuck and lacks self awareness even more so she's a hypocrite after she laid out she expects honesty in a relationship but she can't even do the same. I could've been absolutely fucked if the age of consent wasn't 17 where I live.

Was I right in dumping her? "
18,"No reaction is the best reaction when seeing an ex. What are your thoughts?


Recently ran in to an ex with her fiancé to be at a comedy night. Instead of causing a scene or doing something destructive, I ended up watching the show and left without saying a word or interacting with them.

Feeling a lot stronger I sat through that instead of running away, but would like to know where having no reaction has paid off?"
19,"Gents, how many of you were a bit emotional when you had to get rid of your first car?


Either later today or tomorrow, I will be replacing my first car. It has been with me for almost 13 years now, from fall of 2006 until now. It’s become part of my identity kinda, having an ancient clunker(it’s a 97). But I can now afford to get something that isn’t falling apart, so I’m doing it. However, I know I’m going to miss my car. It’s been with me through quite a lot, from to-and-from work monotony, to a thousand mile round trip to look at a school, to more 4am, way over the speed limit, metal-blaring therapy drives than I care to admit to. It really has not helped that it is a cold and rainy mornin, and a few sappy love songs came on as I drove to work, where I now sit and ask the question: Am I weird for hugging my car and getting a little misty eyed over this?

mobile, formatting, ect."
20,"Men, what is the funnest thing you do/did while recieving oral sex?


I personally enjoy intently watching my girl do it, uncovered, but apparently people are different.

I know what your gunna say, ""WHO DOESN'T LIKE TO WATCH THAT?!?!"" But let me explain:

I was discussing oral sex with my buddy yesterday  and he said that he enjoys it more when his girl's entire head is under the sheets just bobbin' up and down. He uses that time to browse his phone, play phone apps, or just stare at the ceiling and wonder.

I personally love watching a girl in the act. Hell, I make it my mission to move her hair and get the perfect angle while she gobbles my knobble.

I've watched way too much porn to look away.

So are you a ""lay back with your arms under your head while staring at the ceiling"" kinda guy

Or a ""POV camera man getting the perfect shot"" kinda guy? 

Or neither??"

So having never grown up with a father figure around, was never shown  how to tinker with cars or any of that cliche stuff. 
Now i have a 4 year old son who im trying to do my absolute best for and want to teach him cool little things,  obviously i never had inspiration growing up so im reaxhing out,  im after the sort of stuff that makes their face light up when they see something that blows their mind as simple as it might seem to us. 
My question to you guys then is what things can i do around the house/ outdoors that require minimum cost that are seemingly simple but would be absolutely mind blowing to a 4 year old boy.
