0,"What does ""split the bill"" mean to you? [Literally]


The question came from me seeing a post from a girl who offered to split the bill and was disturbed when a guy started calculating what he ordered. Obviously she was thinking that splitting is dividing the whole sum in 2 equal parts. So it got me thinking.

&amp;#x200B;

For me it means and always meant everybody pays for himself (herself), no matter if it is a date, 2 buddies hanging out, a group of friends or any other possible scenario."

3,"What is the best most mind blowing comment that girl made towards you that made your think more of yourself?


I once went out with a girl that I had history with. We went out after not seeing her for 2 years. We had an amazing night with a lot of romantic tension between us. When. I dropped her off at her house after the night out. She leaned in for a kiss and stopped and said:

""Waif, I know you don't just kiss any girl"""
4,"What should girls do in a situation where the guy is a ""loner""?


I'm actually terrified to ask this because I know he has a Reddit lol don't let it get popular. 
There is a guy (M22) that I (F20) have gotten to know over a year at a college we attend and work together at (and soon no longer will be) and he is honestly one of the very few people in my life who I genuinely enjoy talking to that doesn't bring stress or drama into my life. He got me into watching anime, and helped me out a ton when I built my first PC. We online game, send memes here and there, and it's a cool friendship. In other words, I am really interested. 
There are some positive signs he might be interested back, but here is the thing:
He is someone who would rather stay home and have no friends. No hanging out/no friends = no drama in his eyes. He jokes about having no friends, but he really does not go out. I don't mind that he is that way, but how should I know if he'd be willing to ""let me in"", or do I move on?"

6,"Are there really men who are physically attracted to obese women? If so, what is it that attracts you?


One of my friends is trying to lose weight because ‚Äúno one wants a fat wife/girlfriend.‚Äù My other friend argues that ‚ÄúTONS of men love fat women, you‚Äôd be surprised.‚Äù They argued back and forth for 20 minutes. What is your opinion?"
7,"How would you react to a guy friend of your girlfriend having a crush on her?


He hangs with her often, and buys her presents. He also holds her hand and puts his arm around her. He also physically picked her up once when she was tired and wanted to go to bed, but needed help getting to her bed.

My girl has admitted that she slept with him in the past and that they hooked up whenever she wasn‚Äôt dating her exes. She is my first girlfriend."
8,"Men with trust issues, have you stopped dating a girl you really liked that you felt was too attractive for you because of the attention she gets and then gone back to dating ‚Äòless‚Äô attractive people because you found them easier to trust? Why?

9,"When and how did it become cool/normal for boys and men to (generally) adopt defeating habits such as not caring about school, being addicted to video games, thinking it‚Äôs ‚Äúgirly‚Äù to read, etc?


I know this question sounds aggressive, however, I am not sure how I would rephrase it. I‚Äôm just wondering about the reasons behind boys and men choosing/being coerced to adopt troubling habits.

Also, I am not implying that each boy/man adopts these traits. 

Here are some of my ideas:
1) the feminization of lower and middle school grades has created a learning environment unfriendly to boys which causes them to be jaded toward school - the higher the number of boys who are jaded, the more likely it is that it will be acceptable or even cool to not care about school 
2) having a lack of guidance means there is a lack of control of a person‚Äôs life, and using video games to control the outcomes in that virtual reality world gives boys/men a sense of power.

13,"This question is not dating-oriented, but directed at friendships: How often do older males (25+) hang out with their friends?


I am a male of 27 years. I find myself decently mature for my age, but when it comes to how often I hang out with my friends, I think I may have some unrealistic ideas of how often you hang out is normal.

I feel like hanging out with or speaking with a good friend once or twice a week is pretty normal, but it doesn't seem to be the general case with other people my age.
It can leave me a bit lonely at times, that some friends don't seem to have that ""need"" in a good friendship.

Is it that uncommon, or could it be that I'm just not a top priority friend?"
14,"What was running into your ex like while you were on a date with another girl?


Just looking for others opinions/experiences here...

Been dating this guy who is recently out of a serious relationship. At first he played it off like he was over it but then after a month or so he admitted he was feeling bad about the breakup again.... Apparently it was a bad breakup and it's obvious there's unresolved feels and we had a short falling out until recently.

We were on a date the other day and guess who walked into the restaurant - his ex. He immediately got super awkward, tried to not be seen, didn't really talk to me for a good 10-20minutes (focusing on the game on tv instead), I felt awkward... We got the check rather quickly and decided to go elsewhere. But even when leaving, he was walking like 20 ft in front of me! I felt like he didn't want to be seen with me and I was trailing him like a fucking puppy dog.

After the awkward settled, I ask about their relationship and he immediately got defensive and like I should've known better than to ask. (i think that's a bit insensitive to me, especially when the date was basically ruined) turned into a huge fight and he told me he didn't want to talk to me.  naturally, i pester more and air out the feelings i've held back about the situation, like he treats me like shit basically and has 0 respect for me. His response: nothing.  Cool, thanks for the confirmation. 

Has this happened to you - dating while still not over your ex and have a run in like this? Did you feel bad for the new girl at all, or were you just so consumed by your ex that you really didn't give a shit about the new girls feelings?"
15,"How can I become less intolerant of other cultures?


So in case it matters, I‚Äôm a white guy. I never wanted to be one of those intolerant white guys, because it seems so limiting on how you can live your life. When I was younger I had no problem whatsoever with intolerance, but as I grew up, things started to change. I kept getting exposed to these cultures, but people around me started saying that it was unnatural to expose yourself to these things, and that I should steer clear at all costs. I didn‚Äôt accept that thinking at first, after all I‚Äôd been consuming these cultures without issue, and I felt that diversity could never hurt. 

Nowadays however, I think the intolerance has hit me. I‚Äôll be exposed to cultures that I‚Äôm not ‚Äúsupposed to‚Äù be around and it starts making me sick to my stomach. What used to be rich and sweet is now a muddled mess of discomfort and I hate it. At this point, I‚Äôm not sure what causes this sickness, but it means I can‚Äôt even enjoy some of the things I used to enjoy. I miss being able to eat yogurts and cheeses, but my intolerance makes me regret it every time, and the bacterial cultures certainly aren‚Äôt helping my gut either. Have any of you managed to work past this and become more tolerant?"
16,"My (24F) boyfriend (29M) is going out of town for a week and has asked me to house sit. What can I do around the house as a nice surprise for when he gets back?


I currently live at my parents house to save money so my boyfriend asked me to ‚Äúhouse sit‚Äù while he is traveling for work. Basically I can have a week long break from my parents and also watch his house. I want to do something really nice for him while he‚Äôs gone. So far I‚Äôve thought of cooking a bunch of freezer meals so that he doesn‚Äôt have to cook for a while (he hates cooking) and doing a deep clean (vacuuming, sweeping, cleaning the bathroom etc...). 

What else would you like someone to do for you around the house?"

18,"As Men, do you resent that when something bad happens, you have to be the shoulder to cry on rather than crying yourself?


I remember when I was 16 my finger got badly infected and, long story short, I ended up having to have surgery that took like half an inch of my left index finger. I woke up with it already bandaged, not knowing how bad it was. When they took the bandages off, my mum was there, and she immediately lost her head and started sobbing loudly in front of the doctor. Because of that, I think I felt pressure not to process how I felt, and reassure her, even though it was my finger and I felt terrible about it as well. 

I thought it was selfish of her at the time, being the adult in the situation, not to comfort me rather than it having to be the other way around. It's like my choice of how I wanted to react was taken away from me.  

Maybe six years earlier, our house got burgled and they took my dad's car. When we found out in the morning, my mum and sister started crying, not just cause of the car but because of the thought other people had been our house while we were asleep. I was about to start crying too, but I remember that my dad put his hand on my shoulder and told me to keep it together for the others, even though I was the youngest one in the family by far. 

Anyone else relate? Have any other stories?"
19,"How do you handle getting rejected by a girl?


I‚Äôve gotten to know this girl at work, started to like her.. after work, built up the courage to go and ask her out.. only to have her say ‚Äúohh.. sorry I don‚Äôt like you like that‚Äù. I played it cool and said oh okay.. but my heart feels like it was ripped from its chest. Rejection is the worst, it‚Äôs literally somebody just straight up denying you. Feels like shit."

21,"Helplessness in a woman is very unattractive trait. How does it look like IRL?


There is a comment on askmen from a thread ( ""what do women think is attractive but isn't""). It was gilded last time I checked 19 times. 

&gt;  Helplessness. It does not make me feel more like a man to help you through a bunch of simple bullshit daily tasks and listen to you agonize over minor, forgettable issues. It makes you look like a useless complaint factory. Am I your man or your dad? I'll fuck you or your mom. Pick one.

This thing really took me by surprise.  

I'm working on myself right now and I want to be a better future partner. This hit home since I feel I suffer from ""learned helplessness"" because of a abusive background. I know this is a weird question but I'm not the smartest socially. I would like to know your experiences with this irl, examples of this trait and how it looks like. I want to learn how to not be this comment."

My (24f) boyfriend (28m) of 4 years won‚Äôt let me see his naked booty. I can see every other inch of him, but he will not let me see it. Is this common among men, or could there be an underlying reason why he won‚Äôt show it to me? He‚Äôs a very attractive guy, and is very confident in his body so I‚Äôm not sure what it could be!"
24,"How do you react to your girlfriend's male friends?


The post yesterday about the girlfriend and her friend inspired me to write this.

My girlfriend and I live and study in the same city but live separately. I'm from here, she isn't. During university break she'll go back home for a period of the holidays.

I'm pretty confident in our relationship, but one of her best friends is a male who she spends a lot of time with when she's back home. When they're in the same city, they'll go out to eat one on one, and do other similar things. They've known each other for close to a decade but only really became close friends in the last year or so.

I wasn't worried when I first got into the relationship with her (I knew him before), but over the last 6 months he's become more attractive (spent time running it seems). He's taller than me. He's coming to our city next month and she's paying for some of his flight here. Recently she drunk texted him saying that she misses him. They talk often.

As far as I know they've always been platonic friends. Do I have anything to worry about?"

31,"What was the worst poo you've ever pooped?


For me personally... I had quit coffee and because coffee acts as a laxative, when you quit you get constipated to an extent. 

One day i had enough and decided to try get some laxatives to help ""clean me out"". I wanted a natural laxative to reduce damage or what ever. So because i heard prunes were amazing i decided to get prune juice. 

However i grossly underestimated how potent prune juice is. I thought because it was natural i would need to drink the whole 1 litre bottle to get that empty feeling. 

So i drank it, and had to take my gf to her house. She lives 40 mins from mine... 20 mins in i realise ive made a huge mistake,  but i kept telling myself that im going to make it. 

Well we were probably 5 mins away from her house when i couldnt handle it any longer. I pull into McDonalds and empty my guts. Liquid fire. This is when i realised that my morning breakfast that i put ghost pepper sauce on (i love spicy foods) has turned into a liquid and is now ruining my asshole. 

Soon i can leave McDonald's but it doesnt end. The next 8 hours or so, i spent on the toilet. By the end of it, my anus was bleeding. Thank you for reading."

I don‚Äôt hear these stories from my male friends though; even when it‚Äôs highly plausible (not to mention likely) that they face things like this.
