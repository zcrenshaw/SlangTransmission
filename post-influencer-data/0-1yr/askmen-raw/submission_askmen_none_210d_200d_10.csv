0,"What is the right moment to tell your date/fling that you have a micropenis? And how do you go about it?


Not asking for a friend. I never expected to ever have sex, let alone get someone on a date but It happened last week. Everything went well and the second time we met, we both went to her apartment to drink and watch a movie. After we kissed, I just noped the fuck out because I couldn't handle the stress. When do I tell women this info, if at all? "

Just got into Princeton’s summer research program! It’s highly selective and only 10% of applicants get admitted. Have nobody to really share it with but my mom and my brothers and I REALLLLY wanted to tell somebody (:. What brag-worthy things has happened to you recently?"
7,"Have you walked away from someone you love for your own mental health/insecurities? If so, how did it work out for you?


I \[26m\] ended a very good relationship with my now ex gf \[25f\] because i've got some baggage from my previous relationship. I was with my previous ex on/off for four years, it was very draining and emotionally abusive. She would threaten me with ruining my career and family relationships and guilt trip me if i tried to leave. We argued non-stop.

My new relationship wasn't like that but I began doing the same behaviours; not being 100% honest in fear the truth might spark an irrational argument, being defensive over mundane questions like 'wuu2?'. So i ended things last week as i just felt so awful that I was doing this to someone who didn't deserve it.

I'm struggling to come to terms with my decision. We are otherwise very happy and we feel like we love each other (i know some people think 6 months isn't long enough) but I don't know how to get over these issues i have without continuing to drag her into it.

Has anyone else stepped away from something great to work on themselves? How did it go for you?"
8,"Guys of reddit, those of you who have been abusive to partners in the past, how are you now? Have you changed? Do you feel remorse? Not here to judge - I am genuinely curious.


So long story short when I was 15 I was in an abusive relationship with a boy the same age (I am female). He used to hurt me physically and emotionally, and once “entered” (for want of a better word) me condomless non consensually. It’s been a good ten years or so since all this happened and I was just interested in how people on the other side of this now feel. It’s a big ask I’m aware, but it could be really helpful. 

No sympathy please - it’s really not needed although I appreciate the sentiment behind it, I really do not take to it very well.  Thanks everyone! "

10,"Men who were in a seemingly perfect never ending relationship, what caused it to end?


My friends have been telling me I’m “not a real man unless I’ve experienced heartbreak”, and that I’m not completely emotionally mature until that moment either. I’m 20M, been with my partner for almost 2 years, and my life with her is perfect. We rarely fight, parents get along, are accepted into each other’s families, I’m on my way in life being accepted into my dream university and everyone is happy with me. I cannot envision a world in which I lose the love of my life, yet I know that countless men break up with their partners who also have seemingly perfect lives. 

Is this a question that can be answered or is my own naivety holding me from the answer?"
11,"How do you stay interesting as an adult?


When I was in highschool/college, I was never the coolest guy, but I was interesting. I played a couple sports, I had a couple hobbies, I was involved in clubs, whatever.

As I've aged, I've fallen into just keeping up with the hobbies of my friends. And I love my friends, but they just want to play video games, for hours a day every day. I was more or less okay with immersing myself in the gamer lifestyle for a few years, but now I'm in my late twenties and I just feel... *boring*. 

I don't want to be boring anymore, but I also don't just want to go back to doing the kinds of things I did in school. How do you get invested in a new hobby as an adult? What kind of hobbies should I be looking at getting into? "
12,"Men of Reddit, when do you know its time to go to a therapist.

17,"How many of you would date a single mom and how many would not?


I came across a few articles online as to why you shouldn't be with or date a single mom. So I'm now curious to know your take on this. 

A little about me. I'm 24 and I have a 4 year old son. To be honest don't want to have anymore kids. I have been separated and divorced for about 2 years now. I'm not really interested in dating at the moment. I have career goals I'd like to accomplish first as well as maybe going back to school, I haven't decided yet. 

I have used dating apps before, but never included anything about being a mom on bio and it seems like the conversation just dies off once I do mention being a single mom. 

If I do ever meet someone I'd rather not involve my son in to it until i know it's getting serious. Also I would like to wait 6 months before making any introductions. Does that seem reasonable? 

"
18,"How do you cope with being ""just another guy"" in the modern dating scene?


I recently broke up with my only ever girlfriend of 6 years. I'm in my mid twenties and after a decebt period after the break up have tried to put myself out there again.

I haven't had the best luck but recently went on a date with a really wonderful girl. We kissed at the end and I felt a real connection. We have been talking and she says that she had an amazing time and really wants to go on another date.

Recently (as in a couple of hours ago) her close friend told me that she was actively seeing some other guy at the moment. Apparently she has been seeing him for a bit longer than me and they sleep together regularly etc

I'm pretty torn up about it tbh and I expressed this to our mutual friend who said something along the lines of ""she is a free spirit and this is what modern dating is, every girl sees multiple guys"". 

How do you guys cope with that? I don't want to be a part of this modern dating game if I'm just another guy competing for someone's affection. I don't what to know the person I shared a moment with is going home and sleeping with some other guy. Any advice would be appreciated!"

27,"Guys of Reddit, what's your Monday-Thursday after work thing? Also, what's your age? Leaving Friday out because things are usually different that evening.


I'm just curious to know what the guys of Reddit do after work during the Mon-Thur week? When it comes to me, I get home kind of late because I work an hour and a half away from home, so I eat dinner (thanks to my wife preparing it once she is off work), help tidy up and then I play with my toddler until we put him to sleep. Then I try to knock out any miscellaneous tasks, like pay a bill or two or answer some emails that I didn't get to during the day. After I'm done with that, I try to spend some time with my wife or read. If I spend my time with the wife, we'll either lay in bed together and casually watch something while we talk about our day, or we'll fold a huge pile of laundry while we talk and then we go to sleep. If I've had a really busy day, then I'll spend about an hour with the wife and then play video games for an hour or two and then it's lights out at 11 pm with a wake up time of 7 am. Friday evening and weekends are a whole different story, but whats your Mon-Thur weekday routine after work?  I'm 25, btw.

38,"What is an inconvenient truth that growing up has taught you?


I guess I have two. The first is that looks do play a large role in how people perceive your actions. I learned this one early with the whole ""the cute kid is able to get away with a lot in class"" thing. As I have grown into an adult I have definitely seen first hand how people tend to stick a halo on conventionally attractive people and horns on the conventionally ugly people. They then tend to view their actions kinder and harsher than they should objectively should be respectfully. The second one I have learned is that it seems like the cruelest most sadistic people out there are the ones who can put on an air of being a cute innocent girl or charming man by day, but then once the doors close they can suddenly turn.

&amp;#x200B;

Anyways what has age taught you guys? "
