2,"Those of you who have had a midlife crisis and left their wives. How did it work out?


My ex husband cheated on me, then ran off with the woman, leaving me behind to pick up the pieces with my kids.  It was completely out of the blue.    It’s 16 months down the track now, we’re divorced and he got remarried and they’re planning on having a baby soon.  I’m still trying to figure out what the fuck actually happened.   Any insights would be welcome.

6,"(Serious) Widow here. How do I help my 8 yr old son become a better man?


I'm a widow with a young son (8yrs old). His dad was sickly all my son's life and suffered oxygen deprivation/brain damage at the end, so my son only saw an adult man that was laying down, having temper tantrums, and didn't help. My husband died when my son was 6.

&amp;#x200B;

I was the strong one, and modeled ""roll up my sleeves and get shit done"" behavior.  

Its been two years since my husband died and i've been noticing that my son is not showing the type of behavior that I really want to see out of him. 

 \- he cries when he's not winning at games. He shoves game pieces roughly and makes snotty pouting noises. 

 \- he whines when he does not get his way. 

 \- he does the bare minimum of any task. 

 \- he complains about things like ""having to walk too far"" and collapses on the ground, whining

 \- he gets really upset if anyone calls him out on these issues, unable to accept any valid criticism

 \- he's starting to comment that he's getting picked on (which does not surprise me) 

&amp;#x200B;

I call out these behaviors when they manifest. I calmly explain how these behaviors will make people not want to play games with him, will not respect him. I offer him opportunities to step up and praise him when he does. I model hard core ""getting shit done without complaining"" behavior myself and I am paying close attention to my own behavior to see if I'm enabling him. I've been the one who fixes things, earns all the money, and solves all the problems for their entire lives.  His twin (a girl) exhibits the traits that I want to see in an adult (the same ones I'm asking of my boy). 

&amp;#x200B;

Advice please, Men. I don't have man in my life that my son can look up to that can call him out on this bullshit. I don't want to raise a whiny, wimpy asshole who expect to get his way and won't step up to do a decent day's work.  

&amp;#x200B;

Help?

9,"My father and I moved in together to save money while we started our business. I'm 30 and recently single and wondering how to explain this to women without seeming like a basement dweller.


1.5 years ago my dad and I moved to a new city and started a business together.  We chose to get a house together to save money and will be living together for another 7 months. Before this I had a nice house and lived on my own and plan to as soon as I can. Recently I got out of a LTR where this wasn't and issue, but now that I am single I'm concerned how this may come across to women.

But the business is doing pretty well, we just opened our second location. Unfortunately I'm still paying myself peanuts. "
10,"How many 6-year-old's do you think you could fight before being overwhelmed?


My nephews are both 6 and we play wrestle sometimes, I'm supremely confident that if they came at me for real I could take them out with one punch each. But then I got to thinking...what if they got all their friends to team up on me? And what if their friends each brought two friends, and *they* brought two friends, and so on. How many of those little shits could I defeat in combat before they brought me down?  
  
So here's the scenario: You're in the middle of field (football, soccer, doesn't matter, it's an open field) and they start swarming towards you. Angry 6-year-old's, a never ending swarm of snot-nosed rage coming at you from all directions. Lets say they reach you in groups of 5 every ten seconds.  
No weapons. No armor.  
  
How long do you survive and how many do you take down before your inevitable demise?  "
