0,"What NSFW male lifestyle hack can you share?


"
1,"Men of Reddit Y'all ever goto take shit and when you goto take a piss the pee slidees between the toilet seat and the toilet and you don't realize or hear it because you apparently have pissed all over your own shorts?


I'm not the only one right?"
2,"Older men, how do I accept that I’m probably going to live an average, maybe slightly boring life?


I’m in the second half of my 20s and life is good, but it’s average and slightly boring and I always hoped I’d do more, or at least something important. I don’t make six figures but I have a good job doing medic a imaging and make a good salary. I have an amazing fiancée that has a good job too and we live a good life. 

I realize I’ll probably continue my life like this forever, working a decent job, probably have a family, travel a bit, and that’ll be my life. It wouldn’t be a bad life but sometimes I feel very empty thinking that that’s it. How do I accept that I’ll live an average life and that’s it?"
3,"What is the most ‘wtf’ thing you’ve done out of horniness?


I’m a girl and one time out of extreme horniness I googled ‘how to make your phone vibrate nonstop’. I had to take a step back and take a cold shower. But it made me wonder what weird things people can do out of sheer sexual desperation."
4,"What was the most WTF wet dream you ever had?


So for context I have sleep paralysis issues sometimes and I sleep on the bottom bunk in my dorm.

So I have a bit of a crush on a girl in my class. Last night I was dreaming about her and in my dream we were laughing and giggling together in the halls. She then came in for a kiss and right when we were about to make contact I woke up while orgasming. However my sleep paralysis kicked in and I was having to lay there with wet boxers while the disembodied head of Zeus was coming out of the top of my bunk with a puckered face like he was trying to kiss me. It was the weirdest 30 seconds of my life and probably the only sleep paralysis I have had that was simply just WTF instead of scary. 

TLDR: I think I got fucked by Zeus last night. Anyways what is your guy's story?"
5,"What have you done in your past that you could never tell your current partner?


"
6,"Which fictional character you would definitely bang?


"
7,"What's your ""I stuck my dick in crazy"" story?


"
8,"What was the worst moment for your brain to malfunction?


I remember I was going out with this girl I just met, we were talking in the coffee shop and I was gonna say something like
 -What the fuck?
My words changed to
-Want to fuck?

Yelled it by accident.

Ended up with a hand print on my cheek."
9,"How would you react if your SO made you a blanket? I’m on a blanket-making kick and I’m also a single hopeless romantic


"
10,"How do I ask a guy to be my FWB?


I met this guy a year ago through a friend. We are not really good friends or anything but we do text each other once in a while etc. Since we met there's been an instant attraction between us but nothing substantial ever happened until last weekend.

I haven't spoken to him since then and I'm fine with it as that's not outside the norm for us, but I did enjoy the sex with him. How do I let him know politely that I'd like to do it more often and maybe be FWB?

Advice from men needed."
11,"Men of reddit with daughters, has your view of women changed since having a daughter? If so, what?



Feel free to elaborate either way! 

Also if you know anything you view differently now since having a child (boy or girl) feel free to share!"
12,"How long would you let one of your friends who is homeless stay at your house?


One of my friends signed a short term lease a few months ago, knowing that the lease expired at the end of July. Now the friend has been living with me for the past two weeks as he didn't find a new place before the lease expired. He has a job but doesn't really seem to be looking for a new place, and recently left on a trip with his family. Kind of feel like my hospitality is being taken advantage of.


What would you do in this situation?"
13,"How did your wife/SO change after having children?


"
14,"I got told that having a popsocket wasn't manly. What's the dumbest thing that an insecure dude ""called you out"" on for being ""effeminate""?


Question is pretty straight up. I didn't know that holding my phone comfortably was only for girls and women."
15,"What are some great ideas to surprise your wife/gf?


C’mon guy most/some of us are not that creative. But if we band together and brain storm, imagine what we can accomplish and how many browny points will have."
16,"We all know what ""basic white girl"" entails, but what are the qualities of a ""basic white guy""?


"
17,"What are your experiences with controlling or possessive women?


"
18,"What is something that a women has done that made your heart skip a beat?


Me and my cousin visited our friend at the hospital. She  came up behind me and hugged me while putting her head on my shoulder. 
First time ive ever experienced that. Caught me off guard to. He’s still not feeling well so yeah."
19,"What's the weirdest/funniest thing you've seen watching porn?


I was watching porn one time and this guy and girl were getting busy in their backyard by a fence. After a few minutes the neighbor leaned his head over the fence, watched for a few seconds, and then casually sprayed them w a hose. They stopped what they were doing and walked back inside as if it's totally normal to be caught fucking by your neighbor and sprayed with a hose."
20,"Men of reddit, what advice would you give to someone who's never been in a fistfight?


As the title says, I lived in a pretty calm area, out of town, with no brothers, only times I had to fight I can't even remember and it wasn't really a big deal. Thing is I've moved and I now live in the big city. I don't wanna get into fights but I know that at some points it's bound to happen. I've been around fights in my home town but never had to partake. I just wanted to know if you guys had any advices or stories about that sort of things."
21,"Guys who invited a girl out platonically but she thought it was a date, what happened afterwards?


 The lines between ""hanging out"" and ""dating"" seem to be getting more and more blurry. I'd invite any one of my female friends to the movies or to try a new restaurant or like even stuff like camping and it would be completely platonic. I just want to have a good time with my friend. But I recently saw a post on another subreddit that talked about women being told after the fact that they were not on dates and they were completely unaware, and it's for stuff exactly like this."
22,"How do you deal with being the ugly friend?


I am a conventionally unattractive man. I have a weak jawline, a big nose, bug eyes, and facial asymmetry. My friends don't treat me differently at all. It's only when we go out and socialize that I notice the difference between my friends and I. I am invisible and not extroverted or funny enough to make myself noticable. They try to keep me included in the conversation,  but most of the time the focus is on them. I am just an afterthought and it hurts my friendship with them since it makes me not want to go out and do things with them. I'm honestly starved for attention, and I don't want to push my friends away due to insecurities. Its extremely hard to accept your looks though when you are reminded of the difference when you have good looking friends. 

How do I move on from this and accept my looks? How do I not give a shit?"
23,"What’s it feel like having a penis?


So umm what does it feel like having an penis?? Like really, what’s it like? Is it like a really big finger or does it feel... idk different? My ex could move it around up and down but not really sideways I think. Can you move it sideways? Does it feel like a finger when I touch it, but it’s just down there? What about when we suck it or lick? What’s the closest thing it feels like?

I’m trying to imagine if I had a finger down there and was moving it around or if someone is sucking my thumb??"
24,"What can I teach my 7 year old son that will benefit him now and later?


I am a 26F with a 7 year old son entering 2nd grade. What are things I can start teaching him, or doing with him now that will be good for him now and even later down the road. Is there anything your mother did specifically that you remember and cherish from your younger days? Thanks in advance for any advice or opinions!"
25,"What would you say if you found out your SO was posting naked photos of herself online?


Coming from a girl who does this I'm curious about whether most men would be amused or consider it a deal breaker."
26,"For anyone that has suffered from forward leaning head/neck posture, also know as “text neck”, how did you end up fixing your posture?


"
27,"What are some of the more intimate things you enjoy during sex?


Personally I love getting my check and neck getting kissed on. But I never really hear of other men talking about the more intimate acts they enjoy, it’s always the cliche bro stuff like slapping the females ass or stuff like that."
28,"So what kind of lady scares you


I’m taking about a clear walk away situation. What kind of lady/ person are you right away like - that’s an absolute no way Jose. No offense to José."
29,"Men of Reddit who have dated someone with low self-esteem, how did it work out? Did they eventually improve?


I am a woman above the age when insecurities, especially physical ones, can be attributed to teenage hormones and I have been in a happy, monogamous relationship with the same man for over 8 years now. I know that in my case, there is a bit more to it than just plain ol' disliking myself, but the NHS is rubbish when it comes to mental health so I'm trying to conquer this mentality on my own for now.
My SO is amazingly supportive and he's never said a bad word about my body, but there is a limit to how honest I can be about my own self-loathing with him without straining the relationship. I tend to seek far too much validation from him and it's getting to the point where I've accidentally started arguments over practically nothing. The newest target of my own negative thoughts are my breasts - I'm fairly thin and I have the itty-bitty-not-too-pretty titties to go with that frame, so I've been considering getting them augmented. The problem is that my man is a tits man, plain and simple, and even if he says that I don't need to get anything done, he's never given me the illusion that they were perfect. For better or for worse, I even know who some of his favourite porn actresses are (nothing against watching porn) and they're all either C-cups or have brilliantly sculpted natural breasts. And believe me, as much as I try to deny it, I hadn't personally wanted to change my breasts before I found that out.
So basically, I'm looking for anyone who has had to deal with a partner who struggles with themselves, despite every assurance from yourselves to the contrary: how did you handle it, did things eventually improve or worsen?"
30,"Men who packed a bag &amp; left somewhere without looking back, what are your stories? How did things work out?


"
31,"Men who’ve had to pack up and restart, what’s your story?


Well I’m 27 and my wife just left me. She took all my prized belongings and threw them in donation bins. We’ve been together 7 years; in that time we have a mortgage, a puppy, a car loan, but thankfully no children.

All I have now is my trusty station wagon, my road bike, a few dusty belongings I had packed up. I live in a city without many friends as I moved to be with my soon to be ex wife. I guess I’m lucky in that I have a well paying job - of which I’m meant to be on leave from for the next month -  so finance will be tight for the near future with potential to earn once I can pick up a few contracts. 

So I’m sitting in my car at midnight (I’m in Australia), it’s pretty fucking cold lol and I’d love to read any stories of how you picked yourself up from your lowest moment!"
32,"Why are a lot of younger men checking out of trying to better themselves?


Am 36, have a 16 year old step son at home and an early 20s one that just moved out. They seem to have no desire in life. They are content to have a nice computer and spend their time online living with roomates. They did well at school. But no desire to pursue engineering/a good trade, even though they excelled in those subjects. This seems to be common among young men, heard Redditors refer to those as ""grass-eaters"". What is going on? I mean, the world has new challenges, but I'm seeing a giant ""fuck it"" from a lot of (frankly nerdy - hey I'm one too) young men."
