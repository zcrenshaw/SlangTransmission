"
1,"What do you do with the limitless power of pockets.


I‚Äôm a 21 year old female and recently got jeans that had actual pockets. I‚Äôve never had this power before so I didn‚Äôt know what to put in my pockets. When I got to my college class I pulled a shit ton of legos out of my pockets and some of the guys in the class looked at me weird. What are you supposed to put in your pockets? If it‚Äôs not legos then I don‚Äôt know what to do with this newly bestowed power."
2,"Just chased down a lady who hit my car, what is your most ridiculous car accident story?


I was sitting in my car and a lady clipped my back end and kept driving off, I had to chase her down and call the police. She claimed she didn‚Äôt realize she hit me, she was driving for work and her supervisor came and gave me a hard time about their not being any pieces of my car on the ground. I calmly shut her up by telling her the pieces were 2 blocks away because her employee tried to flee the scene."
3,"What's that porn video you keep ""coming"" back to?


"
4,"What's the strangest comment a woman has made about your penis?


I went out with a girl last year and when were getting ready to bump uglies, she was going down on me, stopped and said ""Wow, your penis is really pretty"".

I was weird but I was flattered and the BJ was great.

Please share your stories with some random guy on the internet!"
5,"Men of reddit, what makes you feel unappreciated?

"
8,"I just had my first serious break-up, what happens to my hoodies?


I'm quite concerned, as I don't know what the standard way to handle this is. Do I wait for her to reach out about returning those? Or do I ask myself? Or are they lost forever and I need to invest in new ones?"
9,"Men with 6 pack abs: how hard did you have to work for it?

10,"Men who met the love of your life young (let's say early 20s), how did you make your relationship strong, mature and longlasting despite your age?

11,"My favorite hoodie has been destroyed. I am looking to love again and find a hoodie that actually has a large hood, and not something that wraps my head like a condom. Where can I find one?


My hoodie was the best. It had long sleeves, it was soft, warm, and the hood was gigantic enough for my big ass melon. All the other hoodies I've been in since then haven't felt nearly as good. 

In my arrogance, I destroyed it working on cars while wearing it. 

Pls help. "
12,"How do I stop/prevent being boring?


On quite a few threads on this sub now I've seen comments stating ""Perhaps you're just boring"" and the likes.

I'm noticing the same with me, I can't really have a 1 on 1 conversation, my mind just goes blank and I don't know anything to say. While this is extra when talking to girls, it happens with basically anyone.

And it's not one of those comfortable silences."
13,"How do you deal with the silent treatment from your SO?


Hey guys (possibly gals), I've been with my girlfriend for about 9 months and live together. Overall, I think we have a good relationship, buy one thing that has been a source of frustration for me is the silent treatment. If I say/do something she doesn't like, she just completely shuts down.

Most recent example... Last night we are hugging and I ask, ""Hey, how would you feel if I did this thing?""
""Why?""
""Because I want to.""

At that she immediately leaves the room and doesn't say more than 2 words to me at a time and only when I directly ask her a question. She has done this multiple times in the past and at first, I was understanding, but after multiple instances, I have asked that she communicate with me instead of being silent. We had a pretty good conversation the last time (about 3 weeks ago) and I thought we came to an understanding that she would try to communicate more about how she is feeling and not just shut down.

How do you all deal with that? I'm at a loss."
14,"What are some unexpected expenses for single man that younger guys don't think of?


So, I am currently 19 years old, and because I really disliked school and I studied on industry high school (it's a thing here to prepare people for qualified work if they don't want to study) I went straight to work. I snatched job at security company and I earn pretty much what's average, and now I am planning on moving out from home and sorting my finances. What are some expenses that you discovered when living alone as a single men that most don't think of? "
15,"What should you do when most of your friends are going nowhere in life?


I've got a friend group of about 9 of us. We're all 18-19 yrs old. I'm only super close with a couple of them but we're all friends. I love chilling with them, don't get me wrong, but as I said in the title, most of them are kinda losers, not on a great path. Most of them are super lazy, 0 aspirations. Some don't even have a job, or even a license. We're in all in college, but only a couple of us actually work to get good grades and care about our academics. They just want to smoke weed and play video games all the time.  I don't see very bright futures for most of them, and feel I should distance myself a bit from them, but I don't want to start to lose my friends."
16,"After repeated instances of a school doing nothing with an annoying child, how do you tell your child to react to that annoying child?


Here‚Äôs the story. Kid has adhd. Unmedicated. So he gets a pass on everything. Oh ‚ÄúGeorge is just have a tough day‚Äù. I‚Äôve worked with numerous adhd kids...they aren‚Äôt assholes but this 13 year old is. But the school doesn‚Äôt do shit.

I have a very chill son. He‚Äôs pretty mellow and just rolls with it. But he‚Äôs even tired of the constant hitting, kicking, Name calling, teasing, ect. My ex husband is a freaking wimp and is up the school principle and super‚Äôs ass. He‚Äôs gotta be the golden child so he‚Äôs zero help.

I grew up with this: if someone is messing with you and the adults do nothing, then you take care of it and make sure you come out on top. I‚Äôm at the point, that I wa t to tell my child to take this kid down. Teach him a lesson and let him know he‚Äôs not taking his shit anymore.

And I NEVER condone violence. But here I am. What would you do????"
17,"Men who have never been in a romantic relationship, how do you remain confident?


Badically title.  If you havent been in a romantic relationship, how do you avoid feeling down?"
18,"Men who occasionally or often cum early during sex, how do you and your partner deal with it?


Hey all, just looking for some discussion or advice on the topic of cumming early. Unfortunately, my partner and I are having some trouble as the last couple week's I have been cumming early, my SO is obviously abit upset about it and I'd like to find some kind of solution.

Any anecdotes or advice is highly appreciated. üòä"

20,"What (non-firearm) ‚Äúweapon‚Äù do you have at the ready in case of a break in?


Mostly just curious how many of you have swords. "
21,"How much time or how many meetings do you need, before you feel comfortable to sleep with a new partner?


For the past few years I've been dating around a bit more and as a result, I had more sexual partners and experienced more situations, where I got to know myself better.

In the beginning, I wanted to do the ""hookup culture"" thing and have some ONS. But after some time I realized, that I usually need a few meeting to really open up, when it comes to physical intimacy. Sure, there have been situations, where we had sex on day 1, but in general it wasn't nearly as good for me as when I waited for the second or third meeting - I was more guarded than aroused.

I thought it was odd, that I don't feel like having sex with somebody I just met, but then I talked to a friend, who told me he usually needs 4-5 meetings before he feels comfortable. I talked to another friend, who essentially told me that he is way more picky about having sex than I am (both good looking, successful guys).

Which kinda made me think, that perhaps, it's not that weird for men to need some time to open up? What about you guys?"
22,"How often do you pat your pockets to make sure everything is there?


Bonus question, how often is it because you thought someone might've picked your pockets?"

25,"Any idea how to make a recent amputee boyfriend feel desirable again?


Last summer he lost his left leg up to a knee, due to an accident. He insists on wearing long pants all the time, in bed he's wearing pajamas and he keps making grim jokes suggesting that he would understand if I wanted to leave him.

The psychologist says that all amputees have to go through a period of adjustment, so it's nothing special, but what's unique in this situation is that he's been very confident his whole life, as he is a very attractive guy and now he feels like he lost it.

Any ideas?"

29,"I'll be driving some coworkers around for several hours. What is some ""average"" music people listen to nowadays?


Like, I'm down with pretty much everything but I don't have a defined musical taste so my usual playlists have Finnish death metal next to Stevie Wonder followed by grandpa rock with Linkin Park for dessert and I think that if I were to expose an average human to this for 4-5 hours he will likely commit sudoku, so I'd like to be a merciful god and make a ""neutral"" playlist for my passengers "
30,"Men in your 30s and beyond, what physical changes do you experience and how do you adapt?


Hey guys, I turned 31 a few months ago and feel like I'm starting to fall apart. I remember when I was in my late 20s, a friend in his early 30s said ""one day you willl wake up and feel older"". I thought he was joking. He was not joking.

* Recently, I've noticed ear hair (why is this a thing?) and picked up a trimmer to tackle it.
* My hair is thinning on the top of my head (trying out Rogaine to see if it will work) and noticing more hair just about everywhere else but the top of my head.
* I've been feeling like I need *support* down below to combat gravity (I was warned I wouldn't be able to wear boxers for forever, as I slowly replace boxers with briefs).
* My knee makes the funniest noises and hurts long after a workout (thank goodness for pain relievers).
* Anything more than two beers on guys night, and I feel it the next day (even worse if there is fried food involved).

Not that getting older is a bad thing, but sometimes you can really feel it.

Can you guys relate? What changes are you guys seeing as you get older? And more importantly, how do you cope?"
31,"To the guys in early 30s: Have any of you ever felt really unmotivated suddenly and stopped enjoying things that you loved to do once? How to bring back that motivation and lack of focus, when you are passing through such kind of existential crisis and anxiety?

32,"Men who grew up with porn. Uh, how did you adjust to what actual women look like.


This is an embarrassing problem, but I feel like I've kind of lost my ability to be attracted to women in the real world. I've had porn for as long as I've liked girls and that kinda set my expectation that all the women I've seen naked have huge round boobs and asses, zero body hair, no stretch marks/blemishes, makeup done at all times, etc. And that's not even getting into the views of what sex looks like.   

I basically don't have a reasonable concept of women. Does this go away? How do I learn to be attracted to someone real?"
33,"Men of Reddit, how do you deal with a lover that gets too wet/lubricated during intercourse, to the extent that you eventually lose meaningful stimulation?

35,"How do you prefer to be cold approached by women?


I'm a woman and have never approached men that I've found attractive before. So I'm curious how different men prefer to be approached and what would be a turn off to you.

Online dating sucks... So I mean in person."
36,"How can i make things better for my husband who is a full time employee and student?


My husband seems really overwhelmed with school and work right now. If he isn't at work he is either at school or studying. Besides having his morning cup of coffee ready for him when he gets up and making him meals, what are some ways I can make this grind less brutal for him? I realize this is all to make a better future for us. He never takes a sick day. His one day off from work is spent studying, and I honestly feel so bad for him. He is doing really good in school and I'm so proud of him, but I feel bad because he has no time for leisurely activities or fun in general. So, what can I do to make everything a little less difficult for him? Sorry if this type of question isn't allowed or is asked too often. I just found this sub."
37,"How do you guys stop letting small things get to you?


Maybe I'm hypersensitive or something, but really small insignificant things which happen through the day make me stay up longer than I should feeling more anxious than I should. Like at work, some of the authoritative figures who work at front reception can be really condescending, rude, you name it, and I manage to feel anxious because of them or things they've said all day, help &lt;3"
38,"How did you choose your Reddit username?


A few days before signing up for Reddit a woman whose divorce I'm handling brought in a big box of her husband's porn movies. She said there was some disturbing content on there. She thought we might be able to use it as leverage against her husband.

&amp;#x200B;

I handed the box off to one of the firm's investigators and told him to take a look and let me know.

&amp;#x200B;

About an hour later I walk into the video room. On the 60"" screen is a dude dressed up as Hitler. Mustache, uniform, swastika armband, thew whole nine yards.

&amp;#x200B;

Hitler is bent over a table and being butt fucked by an incredibly well endowed black man in Marine Corps dress blues.

&amp;#x200B;

Herr Hitler was taking a fearsome pounding and there was an alarmingly large pool of blood on the floor.

&amp;#x200B;

Seeing this really stuck in my head and when I signed up for Reddit it seemed like a way to get it out."
