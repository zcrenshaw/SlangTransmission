4,"What was your most humiliating hook up experience?


So there is generally a lot of attention given to when girls feel humiliated after a hook up, but I would like to hear from my fellow guys.

My personal most humiliating one was when I made it as far as getting on a girls bed, but she thought I had abs because of the fact I'm fit. I used to be obese so I do have loose skin in my stomach and she didn't like that. It was pretty humiliating taking off my shirt and then just seeing her interest die in her eyes. I later cried in my dorm afterward. 

Anyways what is your guy's stories?"
5,"Sup dudes. I didn't grow up with a father figure and haven't really learned on my own. What are some tips you would give to your male sons about the hygiene?

6,"when watching porn, how often do you try to cum as the same time as the guy in the video?


I do this a lot, it's very satisfying"
7,"How do I get guys to realize they’re attractive?


I keep running into the issue where I find guys incredibly attractive (they are, its not just me) and try to tell them via compliments or reassurance so they’ll feel good about themselves, but usually they just brush it off and/or don’t believe me. What can I do to make it stick and help them see what I see?"

10,"What emotional labor do men put in that goes unnoticed by women?


Inspired by my CMV post I'm interested in the little things that men do in relationships with women that usually go unnoticed as we often hear about women putting in emotional labor of reminding their husbands to wash dishes or calling relatives and stuff."
11,"Fellow uncles and dads with daughters, my niece got her first period, how can I make this a little more comfortable for her?


Earlier today I got a pretty miserable girl dropped off at my house, she got her first period and she bled through her underwear, her shorts, and on the guest bed at her friend's house. She walked here, got cleaned up, cried a bit, and decided to lay on the couch. Thankfully I keep some pads and midol here for friends and hookups (LPT for you younger guys) so we got the situation under control.  What else can I do to make the rest of today and tonight better for her?"

"
14,"Men: how do you approach the situation when your SO flirts with other guys when you are out partying?


Have the general experience that when we are out, she gets hit on quite  frequently but leads the guys on by flirting back.


Im not really bothered that she gets hit on, i take that more as a compliment  for her and for me, but the fact that shes flirtatious and sometimes completely disregards me makes me wonder how i should approach it if and when it will happen again."

"
25,"I just got dumped for asking consent to have sex. How do you get consent while still being smooth?


We were in bed, undressing, and I wanted to make sure she was ok so I asked if she was ""ready"". She got up, got dressed, said she ""I hate when men ask me to have sex... you should just do it."" Then she left.

After all this me tooo stuff I've been trying to be more considerate and explicitly ask a woman to have sex. But apparently that makes some women mad or turns them off. How do you guys navigate this?"
26,"[NSFW] Guys who hookup with ugly women when desperate, how does the sex differ from sex with attractive women?


So theres no point in asking ""do guys hookup with unattractive women"" because that's been answered and the response seems to be ""plenty do if they're desperate enough."" But how does the actual sex differ? Do you avoid kissing? Do you avoid foreplay? Is it literally just the case of ""penis in vagina and leave when I cum""?"

"
31,"Men of Reddit, what made you think she was into you but turned out she is not?


I've been in this situation. I've known this girl for a a year. She's an introvert, so it was a real challenge for me to talk her at first. But later we would talk for hours. Eventually, I got her on a date. The date went well, she said it took her 3 hours to prepare, she wore short skirt and highheels to my surprise, I had never seen her in these. And a deep cut v-neck shirt (I just call it like that, idk much about women' clothes). Near the end of the date, I confessed and she rejected me with grace.

&amp;#x200B;

My point is, who put that much effort just to hang out with a friend?"
32,"Men in your 20s, what are your biggest frustrations with women who are the same age as you?


Guys in their 20s, when it comes to dating or generally interacting with women in the same age range what are your biggest frustrations &amp; why?"
33,"How do you talk about your day, interests, etc? (23M)


I’ve always struggled with this, and it frustrates my wife to no end. I hate talking with her and most others about what’s going on in my life, the things I’m interested in, what I’m thinking about, the like. 

Whenever I think about sharing, I just feel cringey and stupid, as if talking about what I did at work that day is the stupidest thing I could do in that moment. It’s the worst with my wife, as soon as I think about starting to tell her about something I just shut down. Even though  I know it’s not true, I always just feel like nobody wants to hear about anything I have to say. The only person I really talk a lot to is my best friend because he already has almost 100% of the context for anything I might share from having the same interests for a 13 year friendship. 

Any other men feel the same way and have advice? I know it would make my wife happy if I was able to share more, but it feels like my stomach twists up every time I try, I’m open to try different things"
34,"What was the best dating bullet you dodged?


"
35,"Have you ever resigned from a job? How did it go?


I did, yesterday. The first sentence out of my bosses mouth was ""well, don't expect the grass to be greener on the other side...."". For some perspective: my new job offers better pay, better conditions, and the communication so far has been extremely respectful and positive. My current boss however has called me and my colleagues ""incompetent fools"" more often than he has given basic compliments, you know, a ""good job"" or a ""well done"". 

Which reactions have you received to resignations?"
36,"Straight men, what is a question you have always wanted to ask gay men but afraid to ask (stolen from askreddit)?


Can be nsfw or not, doesn't matter (you don't even have to be pc as long as you aren't an ass). I'll try to answer a lot of these questions, but I also encourage other gay guys in this sub (assuming this sub isn't all straight men) to answer as well."
37,"What new sexual thing have you discovered recently?


Literally got laid ten minutes (not trying to brag) and whilst kissing as usual, my partner started licking and kissing my ear and really tongued it hard. It's weird at first but it felt unbelievably good."
38,"How to gently and smoothly cut off his expectations of having sex, because I'm on my period?


Disclamer: This is maybe a stupid question created by my anxiety, but here it goes:

I'm not in this situation now, but i was before in several occasions and I think I never knew how to deal with it in the best way. So I want to be cool with it next time =p.

Situation: I went on several dates with a new guy, in the last ones we made out and now I feel I'm ready to try the bed with him and he seems to be also excited about that. However, the next date we arrange I know I'll be on my period. 

Solution 1: Sometimes I just tell him when we are already at home making out. I tell him to stop when he is reaching my panties because period... Then I feel bad and stupid cause I feel i caused an awkward moment and maybe some frustration on him. So maybe not ideal.

Solution 2: In other situations I told the guy in advance, just before we met, that we will have a chill night cause I'm on my period. In these situations i felt that they thought that I assumed that they just wanted sex and I feel stupid with that. Then I felt that they come to the date with less enthusiasm and maybe don't stay until very late cause are afraid to get too excited and then being forced to cool it down... 

Solution 3: If i don't say anything and I arrange the date far away from home, being it just another dinner or another drink at a bar, I feel that maybe they start being tired of chasing me and that I'm not interested in sex with them, when in reality I must have been dying to try it with him! Nowadays with online dating I just feel everything is so fast that I'm afraid to pass the wrong impression...

So... what do you guys think would be the best way to tell him? 
Or maybe, should I avoid a date during my period days when we are on the edge of being intimate for the first time? 😅"
