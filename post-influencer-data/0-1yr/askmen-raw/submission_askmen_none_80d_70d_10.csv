Only asking because my brother is currently in the bathroom taking a dump, while eating a bowl of lucky charms...

How?

Why?"
1,"Guys of reddit,what are some things you are expected to do in a relationship but want girls to do more often?

3 years in and I was planning how to propose to the love of my life. Zero warning and she ended it. How do I stop feeling like this?"
7,"As a man in a relationship of over 2 years I've often found that as the guy you're expected to automatically be happy or at the very least completely emotionally stable in any situation, is this common in healthy relationships, and if not what seemed to help ease it?


I can understand that it's partly just from social construct that men are supposed to be level headed and stable, and I don't mind that too much. But it'll get to situations where I'll be on the verge of freaking out from a stressful situation she knows full well I'm in, and then will get upset when I'm short with replies and get distracted. For the most part I don't mind because I'm not generally emotional, but it's situations like the one that triggered this post, where I've got a massive semester exam today and have been grinding like mad because things haven't been looking good, but she got upset because I wasn't sending full replies. Is this common in healthy relationships? And if not then how can I go about trying to correct it?"

9,"When did you guys start becoming interested in lawns?


I’ve noticed this summer that I’ve really taken an interest in lawns. Going on a walk in the neighbourhood the other day I noticed a dad sitting out front his garage. Budweiser beside him, white new balances. The dad shorts and everything.

His lawn was perfect. Immaculate. As I walked by I stared at him and told him what a great lawn he had. Easily beat his neighbouring dads beside him

He thanked me for my compliment and then proceeded to put both hands behind his head and lean back in the self-satisfaction that he knows he does a great job.

I should have befriended him, because if he can mow a perfect lawn. I have no doubt in my mind he can bbq some amazing meat."
10,"What was your awkward moment with your daughters laundry?


It finally happened this weekend, but not in the usual movie/internet sense. It was actually my wife who caused it. 

Our kids were gone all weekend leaving just the wife and I for some alone time. We're really far behind on laundry so we were working together to get it all sorted to be put away. My wife picked up a shred of black fabric that resembles shorts and says, ""ohh, maybe I'll put these on for you later."" Cue awkward moment when she grabs the over side of the waist. ""SHIT! These are Anna's."" and we had a good laugh. To her credit she did have a very similar set of skimpy black shorts in the same load that we found a minute later. It did not reduce the hilarity of the situation. 

She did not wear either shorts later -__-"
11,"How do you stop being so overly sensitive?


I'm a sensitive dude which I like about myself to a certain degree but it has lead to me being really insecure to the point where I can't stand up to myself or for myself. I let myself make all these bitch ass decisions and I don't know why. I can't stand up to adversity at all"
12,"What's your most awkward accidental penis touch story?


I've had many accidental penis touches by men in the course of my sporting career, but that's whatever. 

One time I was in class at college. Girl next to me was talking to a friend, reaches down to grab something from her backpack without looking. She froze and slowly, without letting go, turned and said ""that's not my backpack is it?"" I was like ""does it feel like your backpack? You can let go now btw"". I think she had been too stunned to register that hand removal was necessary. 

Another one, was at the gym on the leg extension machine. Girl came up and said ""hey is that your key on the ground?"". It was under the machine so I turned and started to get up. We did not coordinate well because she was bending down for the key. My pelvis met her face. Since I was wearing sweats, there wasn't much fabric between and she got the full effect of a wang to the face. She turned super red and ran off without saying anything. My buddies were coming up and were like ""damn, she bolted fast, what did you say to her?""

How bout you guys?"

16,"When you're hitting it from the back and she looks back at you, is it appropriate to give a bright smile and wave at her?


Honestly I feel self-conscious if she looks back and I'm completely silent and dead-eyed like years of covert masturbation has taught all of us, but I also feel self-conscious if I start faking moans or something. So I smile and wave."

19,"What's the dumbest, most oblivious thing you have done with a potential romantic partner?


I was reminiscing about a girl I let slip away today, so I'm wondering if anyone can make me feel better about myself, if not you can laugh at me ;)

I was dating a girl who was a really shy, sweet girl. I honestly wasn't really thinking about sex because I thought she wanted to wait, and I didn't want to pressure her.  We were having a blast and there was so much chemistry, but I hadn't made a move by the 4th date. I had already missed a ton of signals at this point, but the worst was coming.... So early on  in the date we had talked about my insomnia. I had explained to her that I work out a lot and am very active, but still have too much energy to sleep. Well at the end of the night I walked her back to her car (she lived far away so we were still at the meet at the location stage) and she said ""I hope you sleep well tonight.... Actually maybe we can think of something to wear you out..."" to which I respond something along the lines of ""what, like run home instead of drive?"" It's really funny it didn't register at the time, but now I can clearly recall her face dropping and she just said ""uh huh....""

21,"Men of Reddit who have had a girlfriend/wife die during your time together. How have you coped and have you been able to move on?


My girlfriend of five months recently passed away. Even though I didn't quite know her for that long it feels like there is a whole in my chest as she is the first girlfriend I ever had. So far my family keeps saying I'll find someone else but I don't really want to go looking for someone to fill the gap she left when she passed.

24,"How to figure out her ring size?


So I plan on proposing to my longtime girlfriend soon and want to keep it a surprise. We've talked about getting married before and such. She's told me she doesn't know what her ring size is as she doesn't wear jewelry outside of a necklace I gave her for her birthday  last Christmas. I'd assume that her family wouldn't know either since she doesn't wear any.

&amp;#x200B;

Would I be able to go to a jeweler to be able to swap it out if need be or is taking her in and having her pick one an okay strategy?

&amp;#x200B;

Also don't worry about her seeing this she thinks Pinterest is better then Reddit and I have yet to break her of that way of thinking."

30,"What's your advice to someone dating someone with avoidant attachment style?


Explanation of avoidant attachment style:

As an adult, if you display avoidant detachment behavior, you have learned to create ways to separate yourself from any possible fear. Or you may avoid close situations and intimacy to prevent the risks of loss or emotional hurt. Some examples of how you may do this are:

You may push other people away if they start to get too close. This is like a push-pull dynamic. You think you want someone around, so you pull him or her in. But then, when they are with you, you push them away. Others, especially partners, think you give mixed signals and may tell you so.

You may be big on boundaries. You may create physical and emotional space from others on a regular basis and avoid too much closeness or intimacy. You may not like discussing your emotions at all or allowing your friends or partners to know when you are upset.

You may be very independent and self-reliant, believing that you do not need others to achieve what you want in life. You may reinforce your independence with internal dialogue like “I don’t need anyone else”.

You may choose relationships or romantic partners that you know are not really a good match. Or they may be obviously unlikely to last any significant distance or depth. These may be very short-term, sexual relationships. Or casual flings with people who you know are also unable to commit. People with insecure attachment styles often form relationships with others with insecure styles.

You may find reasons why a relationship is not going to work or look for fault where there is none. You may be very critical of yourself and others in your interactions.

You may idealize what “perfect” romantic relationships and intimacy are. Or you may have unrealistic expectations of what a relationship or partnership should be.

After you finish a relationship, you may spend an extended period analyzing what happened. Then not coming up with any answers, or not acknowledging what contributed to the breakup.

You may think you want commitment and intimacy with people or your partner. Yet you run for the hills at any serious signs of this in your close relationships.

It is as if you unconsciously self-sabotage in your relationships with others and your partners."

33,"Men who avoided getting into relationships, how long did you try to stay single and what was the reason why?


I avoid relationships because even when I really like the person, becoming a thing really overwhelms me. I can’t handle the emotional attachment someone will eventually have for me, it makes me feel trapped and like they have expectations of me that I’ll struggle to maintain and let them down. 

Probably because of my shitty past relationship but hey ho. Someday right?"

So I’ve known this girl for a long time and we’ve been pretty good friends for a while now. She’s easily the best looking girl I know and I’ve told her that multiple times. She’s touchy with me a lot and when we were in the car the other day she started playing with my hair from the backseat and pinched me on the neck (it was a pretty hard pinch actually 😂) and said “let me give you a hickey” and she just started laughing. It’s so hard for me to tell because none of my other friends who are girls do that stuff with me. I always keep eye contact with her for a long time too and I always found that funny because I’m a pretty shy person. She’s so cute and sometimes I just wanna go in for the kiss but everytime I back out of it. When all that stuff happened the other night it really made me think though. 


What do you guys think? Has this kind of stuff happened to you before?"
