0,"If a girl sent you this text what would you think?


This guy and I have been flirting, we know eachother but we‚Äôve just recently expressed some interest in one another.  I had to take a work trip and he told me to let him know when I‚Äôm coming back. 

I was thinking of sending 
‚ÄúHey David just letting you know I come back next week üòä‚Äù 

Does it sound too eager? Does she sound interested or friendly? Is there a better way to phrase it?

4,"Leaving some beer spilt on carpet


So like I just spilled a decent amount of a beer on my carpet, I immediately soaked up all I could with a towel. Do I actually need to spray this with a carpet cleaner, soak it up with paper towels and all that? Like how big of a deal is it if I just leave it?

I‚Äôm 21 and living in a bit of a bachelor pad, everything is organized and fairly clean for a 21 year old dude. Only spill I‚Äôve made so far is this beer but I figured worst that would happen is the room smelling slightly of beer which none of the friends or girls I bring ever could care less about. So is soaking all I could up with a towel sufficient or do I like actually need to buy some carpet cleaner?"

10,"How to receive and respond to compliments by women?


Hi there,

&amp;#x200B;

I'm a young guy with zero experience with women. Socially inept to a certain extent. I've yet to understand how to receive and respond to compliments by women.

I'm talking about stuff like:

""Nice hat!"", ""Nice truck"" or ""I like your sunglasses"".

For example today I was at a drive through coffee joint. Girl on the other window(the one not attending my side) yells out ""I like your hat"" didn't think she was talking to me so I ignored her. Then she yells out again ""nice hat"". I didn't say anything and just gave her a thumbs up. What I really wanted to say was ""you have an amazing ass"" but of course that wouldn't be proper. Now don't get me wrong, I know these girls say nice things to get tips and not because she thinks I'm hot and she wanted the D.   


I feel like simply responding with a ""oh, thank you"" is too nice or simple and I could respond in a more interactive fashion. How do you guys respond to compliments by women? "

15,"What makes you tease your girlfriend's friends?


A few of my man's boyfriend's like to tease me sexually, nothing disrespectful, just a bit of teasing here and there (threesome jokes etc). My friends are present and they also take it lightly, no jealousy whatsoever, it's all innocent. 

But I'm just wondering if guys would tease someone even if they didn't find them attractive? Like is it just a way to make the ""third wheel"" feel included or better?"

21,"What are your experiences with ""the one who got away""?


My boss (35) apparently dated someone who had a lot of meaning to him when he was younger (20), claiming she was ""the one who got away"". According to other co-workers, he hasn't been romantically the same again. Yes he continued to date, but according to him they don't mean anything to him. 

Why I am asking this is, because me and a girl couldn't work out. We spent years talking, had mutual feelings, and clicked perfectly. But because of long distance, school, and other excuses, it couldn't workout. I'm disappointed that it couldn't work out. Im trying to not let it bother me but I've tried dating other girls but nobody attracts me. I tried to work on myself but whenever I try to date again it's just boring. 

I'm honestly scared to become like my boss, and I'm scared this girl is ""the one who got away"". I tried the advice in cutting all ties, but I guess that isn't working. Does anyone have experience in something like this? And if so any tips on moving on? "

32,"Looking for people's experience with hair products (mostly about clays)


-TLDR: looking for people's experiences with Clay's as a hair product.

Recently I decided it was finally time to try out a new hair style, and so far I'm loving it. The barber suggested I try out some products and I'd decided to take a look at them. A lot of people suggest pomades, but I'm not a big fan of the greased look. After looking around it sounds like Clay's seem pretty good. 

They can do medium to high hold depending on if you apply them to dry or wet hair. Same for low to medium shine as well. They also seem to be pretty healthy for hair as well. I've also got straight hair that's about medium length. So it shouldn't clump up like curly hair.

I've tried looking on this subreddit for peoples experience but I haven't seen much discussion on them. I'm curious why people don't discuss them that much."
