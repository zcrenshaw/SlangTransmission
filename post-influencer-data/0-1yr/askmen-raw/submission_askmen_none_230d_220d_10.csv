0,"What's the most attractive physical feature of a woman?


 I'm (21f) attracted to a man's facial features, I love my SO's big eyes and just seeing how he looks at me with them is the basis of my attraction towards him....... kind of corny but nonetheless I'm attracted to his face.

&amp;#x200B;

Also I'm attracted to a size difference if that makes sense. I like my partner's height and build because I feel a tad bit protected next to him . 

&amp;#x200B;

just curious

1,"A guy that I (F) just started seeing is amazing and we get along great. However, he’s disclosed to me that he sometimes has difficulty staying hard. How do I go about this?


I want him to feel comfortable and not judged by me. He’s an amazing guy and deserves to feel at ease. I really like him and don’t want to do anything that could be perceived as frustrated or mad at this. I feel like this might be doing a number to the way he perceives himself. I also think that a lot of it is mental, so I want him to feel comfortable around me. Any do’s/don’ts to make the best of this situation? "

7,"What did someone on a date do that made you think ""I didn't think someone like this could even exist outside of movies""?


My friend just got back from the worst date ever. The girl showed up to the restaurant, decided to get barefoot. She went into the bathroom barefoot. The topics of conversation included how clothes are pointless and how she wants to live a hippy lifestyle and doesn't believe in toilet paper. Oh yes, this was off Tinder.

She clearly lacked common hygiene, and I didn't think anyone like this could actually exist. What's your worst of the worst?"
8,"Husbands/boyfriends, how can your SO show you support and encouragement?


My husband is opening a business, and we’re about to have a second baby. He doesn’t talk about the stress but I know the changes and the pressure of supporting a growing family are weighing on him. It’s easy to get wrapped up in my own stresses (7 months pregnant is no picnic) but I want to find ways to let him know I support him, besides talking about it (which seems to stress him out more) ideas for little gifts, favors, general feel-good stuff would be helpful.

11,"How do you all maintain your pubes? I was never taught how to do it.


No one ever taught me how to do it right. Am I the only one who squats over a toilet and wraps toilet paper around the edges and on the floor to collect up any cut hairs?
Have I been doing it wrong my whole teen and adult life or is their some mysterious technique I was never educated about?

35 year old man here. This is the year I've decided maybe genetics just isn't enough to keep me fit. I've been pretty lucky with that so far, but now as I'm aging I realize that I'm actually going to have to put in some work... I've started a workout program where I'm beginning to see some real results! However, there's just one area where I'm getting nothing; my damn gut. 

Men, what's worked for you? I'd like to know some first hand accounts on what has actually worked. I don't want to look like Homer Simpson...."

I've been going through a really tough time this last week and bf has been incredibly supportive by cooking dinner, being affectionate and even offering to help me with my problem. He has just generally been there for me a lot. I normally tell him I love him, care for him and appreciate him every day so I feel like just doing that is not enough to show how grateful I am. 

What romantic gesture would you appreciate? I would plan a day out but he doesn't like going out much. "

35,"We dont know whats wrong with his hurting penis


My (f29) BF (m30) have some issues with his penis.. And I dont know how to google this issue.. 

He says it feels like his fore skin is to small. And when its pulled back, it looks like someone has put a rubber band on penis. Like some kind of pressure.. Also, he has some “dry skin” on it and looks a bit res. We have sex once a day if that matters. I give him a lot of BJs, maybe I ruined something with my teeth? Also, its not a STI/STD or allergies. 

What can this be?!"
