Please hurry. This isn't a one wiper"
2,"What innocent thing turns on your SO?


I recently found out my girlfriend thinks is super hot when I eat a lot. Like the kind of eat when nothing seems to satisfy your hunger so you just eat everything you can. She told me there's something hot and manly about a guy who just eats a lot of food like a man should. Since this revelation, I've considerablely started eating more lol 

What completely normal/innocent thing does your SO think is really hot?"
3,"Men of Reddit, what stupid things you do to annoy your SO?


When my boyfriend farts, sometimes he'll do a scissors-hand-gesture at his butt to 'cut off the fart cloud', and proceeds to 'fan the fart' towards me to mess with me.

Or when I'm taking my time going through the products at some drugstore/cosmetics &amp; beauty store, he'd sometimes tie his hoodie really tightly around his face (so that only a small part of his face is exposed) while keeping a very serious face, following me around the store. He looks absolutely ridiculous doing that and I'll just cut my shopping short because peoplr are starting to stare at him.

I may get hypertension if this goes on but eh, I love him.

So I'm wondering what do you guys do to your SO to annoy them?"

6,"Men who are Dads, what's the most most tender moment you've had with one of your children?


I've had many, but the one that stands out was probably the time me and my wife were having some money worries.  We were talking it over downstairs when our six year old came downstairs with his piggy bank and told us that we could have all his money if it would help the situation.  We hadn't even realized he'd been listening.  We gave him such a hug and it reminded us that despite being low on funds temporarily, we had so many other things to be thankful for like wonderful kids."

11,"What are the chances of peeing in my girlfriends mouth when I’m asleep?


(Posting here cause my gf doesn’t have enough karma) 

So basically, my girlfriend has asked me an interesting question. 

She’s expressed interest in waking me up in the mornings a certain way but is scared I will pee in her mouth while I’m asleep. I have absolutely no idea if this is possible aha. 

I’ve never been given a morning blowjob before and we were both curious as to if its a risk - anyone know anything about this or have similar experiences? 

Thanks!"
12,"Men over 40 how do you deal with career failure?


I've just turned 40 a few weeks ago, all of my life I have been a risk-taker —or just plain stupid— thinking that perhaps I could be great someday.

&amp;#x200B;

I've worked in 3 countries for more than 15 years just to pursue my dream, yet with the bout of depressions, struggles, frustrations, suicidal thoughts, sleepless nights, etc. the result has been another mediocrity to another the only thing that change is my greying hair and my depleting confidence.

&amp;#x200B;

My boss is 10 years younger than me, most of my friends who were partying when I was slaving in my 20s, thinking that I could become huge someday, has surpassed me already, some of them even had owned their company or become a bigshot at their work.

&amp;#x200B;

Right now I just feel drained, thankfully I still have a job and have a happy family. I wanted to quit and rest, but as the sole breadwinner and without another good option out there the only thing I could do is to endure the pain, it feels like a knife being inserted slowly into my chest."
13,"What do you guys do after work?


My current routine is wake up 6 and lay in bed until 7:10 in hopes of falling back asleep. Get to work at 8. Get off at 4:30, sometimes earlier. Go to the gym. Eat. Lay in bed and watch TV until I fall asleep. Job is super low stress and I feel like I should be doing something with my time but I lack the motivation to do anything. I think I want to just go home and lay in bed but it feels like my life is wasting away so I figure I’d ask for ideas."
14,"How do you men feel about potentially dating/ having sex with a girl with a disability?


I was born with a muscular dystrophy and am too weak to walk so I'm bound to a wheelchair.
I'm told I'm really funny, have a great personality and although I'm self conscious and shy I'm a pretty sexual person who is always open for new things. 
Because of my disability Im not very bendy and can fuck only in missionary or in a spooning-like position and can't really move a lot and be phisically initiative or take control.

What can I do to higher my chances of a guy being into me and not intimidated before really getting to know me? Is there a way to put myself out there without being an feeling like I'm an imidiate turn off or I'm humiliating myself? I feel like gonna die alone lol so guys, please be completely honest on how you feel about it."

16,"How do you deal with a girlfriend that hates men?


We've been dating for about 10 months. Last night we were laying in bed and she started on this tirade about how men were awful, awful people. Not all men, just 95 percent. Acrimony ensued. The argument continued in the morning, and she just could not understand why I was offended. Now, she has had horrible experiences with men her whole life long, and I can see why she'd feel that way. But I value that part of my identity, and I value the good men who have been my friends and mentors over the years, and for her to shit on that is not okay. I'm not going to end things over this, but I need to get right with this. Advice?"
17,"I’m wanting to get better at talking to people. How do you hang out at bars on your own?


I know this is one of those “how do I human” posts, but I don’t care. I’ve struggled talking to people my whole life, but somehow I made a few friends now. But all of them have significant others and don’t really have many friends themselves. So I never get opportunities to try and talk to new people. I’ll be honest that it scares the fuck out of me to talk with random people. I travel for work so I figure it’d be a decent idea to go to bars since my other option is to sit in a hotel all night. My goal is to improve at talking with people (girls and dudes). I figure I’m going to sound and act autistic for awhile, but I’m tired of being lonely. Anybody done something like this? Just looking for advice"
18,"I hear that girls in male-dominated classes like engineering and computer science get a lot of attention from the guys and get hit on a lot. Men in female-dominated classes (eg nursing, education), do you get the same treatment? If so, how often?


"
19,"How common is the habit of calling your SO demeaning names when arguing?


My bf calls me the worst possible things he can think of when we argue. For example, he uses the C word, calls me white trash, says I'm fat, calls me a loser, etc. Later on, he apologizes and tells me ""I didn't mean any of it, I was just mad!"" In my gut I feel this behavior is unacceptable, but then again, I have also said and done things while being angry, that I regretted later. Any thoughts on what I should do?"
20,"When did confidence finally happen for you?


Trying so hard and doing different things, have seen therapists and coaches, done meds and therapy. Nothing has clicked. I do abysmally with women and I'm lonely. The only thing I've got going for me is my career.

How did you finally get (genuine) confidence? What made it click for you?"

22,"How could women make you feel more sexy/attractive?


Coming from a girlfriend who's head over heels for her man, it breaks my heart when he gets self conscious about his body or looks. I want him to someday see how attractive he is in my own eyes, but even more so feel confident in his skin.

&amp;#x200B;

What gestures or words have or could women give to make you feel more sexy or attractive?"

24,"[Serious] What can I do/say to raise a man's low self esteem/self worth?


I'm truly lost, For 5 years I've given him so many compliments and done countless kind gestures and he still doesn't value himself. I've also written him letters telling him how much I love him, care for him, how much he means to me &amp; how much he's changed my life. It really breaks my heart when he says he doesn't care for himself. Any kind of help/advice is appreciated, as long as it's serious. Thank you for your time :)"
25,"What's your secret weapon to ending a fight or argument with your SO?


My Dad told me that whenever Mom was pissed at him, he'd just try to make her laugh or smile, even the tiniest bit. Once he would get her to that point, it was impossible for her to really stay pissed off. And even if she was still upset over something, they'd be able to talk about it a much kinder way without any yelling or anger."

39,"Men of reddit, how do you avoid mentally checking out on life?


I’m a 19 year old returning to my 3rd year of a mechanical engineering degree in the fall, and the further I progress both academically as well as into adulthood, the more disillusioned and cynical I seem to be growing with the world. Politicians are hypocritical and corrupt in the countries with democracies, and authoritarian dictators in the ones that aren’t. The oceans are filled with plastic and the planet is dying with no realistic plans of changing it soon. The wealth gap keeps getting larger, while the 0.1% approach levels of wealth they couldn’t sped if they tried. Everything has become an advertisement, and is trying to sell you something. I personally feel like I need to sell my soul to a company when I graduate,  and that the current corporate culture in the world is exploitative of consumers and employees for the benefit of a handful of people at the very top. On a personal note, I feel like I’m probably going to be alone forever, and even if someone could find a way to love me I would fuck it up. Most importantly, I feel powerless to change any of this, and will just exhaust myself by even trying. It feels like the best course of action would be to just stop questioning the world, conform to its shitty rules, become a corporate drone, and try not to think too hard about how I’ve compromised all of my former morals by participating in this flawed system. I don’t want to stop caring, but it seems beneficial to my own sanity. What do you guys do to keep yourself optimistic on your way through life?"
40,"How, if at all, do you handle being excluded from work events as a man?


I work in an office that's about 50/50 male/female, but my team is *entirely* women except for me. We get along super well, with most of my team confiding both professionally and personally in me, and often hang out outside of the office.

But it irks me that the office sponsors a women's lunch about once a month for the girls to go out to eat and bond, and there's no real men's event. It's not so much of a equality thing - the issue is that a good chunk of my professional team is regularly out of the office for extended periods of time, where I have to cover for all of them, and where I'm the lone person on my team excluded from any bonding. 

It's not the biggest deal in the world, but feels a little bit demoralizing to be the *only* one there that's excluded."
