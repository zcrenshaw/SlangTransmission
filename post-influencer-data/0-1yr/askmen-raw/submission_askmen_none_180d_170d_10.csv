0,"What's your best ""OH SHIT"" moment story when you realized you were instantly in a situation?


What is your best story where everything flipped in a moment's notice and you knew you fucked up? 

When I was in college,  I drove 3 hours back home to see my old man. We ate dinner and hung out. When he went to bed I went to see some old high school friends. I called on my way over to see who's house they were at. They told me where and said they were back in my buddy's room at his folks place,  just come on in. So,  I grabbed an 18 pack and headed over. His old man was a hardass and was on call all the time so, being polite, I slipped off my shoes on my way in the front door and snuck down the hall quietly so as not to wake him or his mom up. The house was very quiet. When I got to his room, I opened the door, flipped on the light and stared at it... empty. I didn't keep up with him real well and had been away 3 years and it was at that exact moment,  at 12:30 am that I remembered it. His mom and dad moved after high school. My heart started beating out my fucking chest. My nostrils cleared and all my senses were on end with the adrenaline rush. Whose fucking house was I in?  Is there a dog? Do they know someone is in here. Do I call out, apologize, try to explain, and hope they don't come out with a gun? Or, do I sneak back out the front door and hope I haven't been noticed?  It's a rural town. Everyone has guns. I say fuck it. Flipped the light off and started tippy toeing my bitch ass back out the front door. It seemed like it took forever but I made it back out the unlocked door,  closed the door,  and ran for my truck. Called my buddy for the new address while he laughed his ass off. As it turned out, I knew the family who bought his folk's old place and probably would have survived but holy shit that was spooky"

3,"How would you feel about your SO talking to other guys at a bar/club to get a free drink, with no other intentions? Am I being unreasonable if I think it's not appropriate?


So my girlfriend is going to Vegas in a few weeks with some of her girlfriends. She was asking me if it was okay if she hit on guys at clubs/bars while there, but only as far as to get a free drink from them. I told her I was hesitant about it and would prefer she didn't do that. 

I have complete trust in her, and I am not in the least bit worried about her doing anything (and frankly, if I did, that would be a whole different problem). I am mainly worried about her being safe - for example, she could be leading on someone who will not easily accept her just taking a free drink and moving on. In addition, the whole concept just seems a bit weird to me, and as a guy who was once single, it seems kind of messed up on the other end.

Is it too ""controlling"" or unreasonable that I prefer that she not do this? I never want to be that kind of boyfriend and that is completely not who I am, and I just wanted to know if anyone has encountered such a situation or if anyone had any thoughts about it."
4,"Guys who have their stuff together, but won't commit, what's your story?


I come across a lot of women complaining about not being able to find both qualities in a guy.

So, if you're a guy who has a great job, maybe an education or are a smart dude, you're good with people and kids, good with your finances, take care of yourself and considered attractive, you're cultured and not a douche, but you just won't commit, tell everyone why. 

As for me, I grew up with divorced parents who always spoke badly of each other and of the opposite gender.  Then, I got burned in a divorce and had to really fight to be in my kids' lives, which was especially heart wrenching. I'm almost done raising my boys and the memories of the fear of losing them still affects me. It really was the scariest time of my life."
5,"What are some relatively unknown grooming/hygiene techniques for men?


I don't know if it's an Indian thing , but my parents have never talked to me about hygiene , sex ed, or anything of that sort .
All the information I have is from friends, which is extremely unreliable at best .

I always feel dirty , even after a shower .

I'd like to know more stuff basically , I think I have very little knowledge of good etiquette"

10,"How do I handle my wife's miscarriage ?


We have been married for a year and a half.  We had been trying for a few months, and when the test was positive, we were so excited that we told family and friends immediately.   This was a mistake.

Our first dr visit, based on her last cycle, should have been her 6th week.  We were disappointed when the ultrasound only showed a gestational sack and a yolk.  A week later at our 2nd visit, both were bigger and there appeared to be a amniotic sack as well.  Our doctor predicted,  aged on her irregular cycles, that my wife just ovulated late.  We scheduled a visit for 2 weeks later.  

As we were preparing for our spring break trip to San Francisco (I'm a teacher) she began to spot and have a brown discharge.  Literally the day before we left, we had a dr appt.  We saw the gestational sack and it was bigger.  When the dr came in, we learned what I had suspected for the past week: we were losing the baby.  

We left the next day for San Francisco after many tear-filled moments of deleting pregnancy apps and storing pregnancy books and discussions of when we should tell our families, friends and bosses.

We got to SF, and it is gorgeous.  The weather is great and we have done a lot of touristy shit to distract ourselves...except...ahead is bleeding...and today she has seemed to have a chunky discharge...which led to many tears and numbed out convos in the hotel.  

Right now I'm at a bar at our hotel.  My wife is in the room.  She told me to have a few drinks bc I have been catering to her needs during our tours the past two days...havent been able to explore much.  

Idk what the f to do or say.  I'm trying to be a strong shoulder to cry on.  It is affecting me, but I'm kind of numb about it still.  Any advice is appreciated.  "
11,"What’s small steps can I take to be more masculine?


A little about me I’ve always been the softly spoken one who is never heard even in a debate people just brush over me,I’m 5ft 9 and small build and never really taken very seriously.
I’ve always struggled with weight at 19 I was 7st and have over time mostly beaten an eating disorder (with a lot of help from me amazing SO) to get to 13st and am staring to take the gym seriously.
Apart from getting bigger at the gym I can’t think of much else that will make people view me as a man and not a boy I’m almost 30 and it just really pisses me off"

24,"My brother was just assaulted by his (now ex) girlfriend, which will leave a permanent scar on his face, and everyone outside of my family has laughed at him and/or asked what he did to deserve it. What can I do to help him?


As the title says, my brother was dating/living with a girl who is an alcoholic and recently she went on a bender which ended up with him telling her she needs to move out, at which point she assaulted him (leaving multiple marks/gashes/bite marks). He did nothing to retaliate, and has on a recording her admitting that he didn’t touch her or initiate physical violence. However, he doesn’t want to press charges because he’s afraid he will get blamed for it. To make matters worse, his friends or acquaintances who have inquired about the gashes on his face have laughed at him when he’s told them it was his girlfriend because she goes into rages when she’s drunk, and she’s an alcoholic. This is just... so not okay, and I know he feels helpless and I don’t know how to help. I just want to help. "
