1,"When did your penis stop growing?


17 here, wondering if this is pretty much my final size, (which i’d be 100% fine with) or if i’ll probably be bigger by the time i’m in my 20s"
2,"My boyfriend says really mean stuff to me when he is mad or when we’re in a fight. What do I do?


He said stuff like my personality is gross and back then when we broke up he was pointing negative things out about my appearance. He says he doesn’t mean these things but I feel like he does. We have a child together and we have been better recently but these words echo trough my mind and make me feel despiteful about myself. He’s not someone who you can easily have a conversation with about these things, and he does have good things about him too... I don’t want to break my family apart but I just want to work on this because I don’t think he realizes how much it hurts me. I want to try and better myself cause I don’t love myself, and I think it’s hard for others to love me too"

6,"If you were interested in a woman who is a recovering sex addict, how would you want her to go about telling you?


I've already been on a few dates with men in which I shared usually by the second date, or earlier that I am a recovering sex addict.  A couple have responded positively to boundaries I set early, and wanted to keep seeing me, but I suspect if I knew the general male payche better, things could go smoother?
(We stopped dating for other, unrelated reasons.  Great guys, though.)

If you were interested in a woman akin to me, what would you want to know, and what would you prefer she not tell you?

Possible questions—
How long she has been in recovery? 
What led to the addiction
What led to the recovery?
Is she an insatiable sex addict or one who has perpetual sex out of a compulsion to please even when it's unhealthy for her? etc.

How early or late would you prefer she tell you along with what physical boundaries she is comfortable with?"

20,"What kind of products do you use to help take care of yourself, and how does it help?


Alright so gross secret coming out. 14 years ago I started having this weird black dots on my nose. Now I know they are blackheads. I also have a beard, and I for a long time I didn't really wash it much. I didnt use body wash, beard oil, anything really other than a bar of soap on my face and some shampoo on my head.

Now I'm in my late 20s, I started using body wash, beard oil, beard and face wash, beard softener stuff all within the past few weeks. I also bought some strips to try to remove the black heads, should get them next week. I'm excited for that, hated my nose since I was in middle school. I also got some stuff for my hair to try to style it, can't thank my sister enough for it.

I was just wondering if anyone else uses products for their beards, hair, body, etc? If so what do you use and how does it help?"
