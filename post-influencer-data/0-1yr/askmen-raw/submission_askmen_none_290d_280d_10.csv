I am a female person and have always wondered what the big deal is. What prompts this insecurity? "

6,"How competitive are you with your friends?


I've generally found men to be quite supportive when approaching new endeavours. However, I was talking to a female acquaintance of mine, and she was saying she felt bad for being jealous about a mutual friend's new project. I was quite surprised since this acquaintance is quite lovely, attractive, and successful and started her own niche business, but apparently she felt jealous if any of her friends started a new project and would hope our friend would fail!

Let's say men idolise Elon Musk, and want to be like him and start their own companies, I think most men would be quite supportive and encourage them on. Whereas, let's say a woman admires another woman, say Martha Stewart, Oprah Winfrey or Gwyneth Paltrow, or just generally anyone else, shouldn't women be flattered that they are an inspiration to others, or do women generally secretly want all other women to fail?

This is just a random example and meant as an unapologetic, perhaps widespread generalisation that may not necessarily be true. So I'm curious, are you competitive with your friends?

Just in my own perspective, I generally like to cheer on people who are my friends; people who have done me wrong, hell no though, and I couldn't care less. I wouldn't wish them ill, but I would no longer spend energy thinking about them at all, and pretty much cut them out of my life.

7,"How do you stay fit while working shifts?


I've started a job with quite an odd shift pattern, and I've noticed myself putting weight on because I just can't seem to find the time to get to the gym. I used to play football every Tuesday/Thursday/Saturday but with my hours being all over the place I can barely get to training anymore.

Anyone else working odd shifts manage to have a decent fitness regime at the same time?"

if you think independence is important to you , will you describe what it means and what do you do to keep it ?

And if it has caused any issue before ?"
10,"What -little- thing would you do for your SO?


Hello, I am a female and I just had a mini fight with my guy about something really stupid. It might be my fault and being extremely unreasonable or demanding, but I just got really disappointed when my SO refused to change his phone lock screen to a picture of us. I have a pic of us for mine. He says “its normal for girls but guys don’t usually do that.” I stated it would make me happy and I can’t really understand why he is so adamantly refusing it. I’m just a bit disappointed and hoped for more care or romance I guess. 

Men of reddit, just to get things off my mind, are there some things you would do for your SO that seems like a really small thing but makes your SO happy? Do you mind sharing what it is? 

Bonus: How do I deal with something small that a guy won’t change for me? Would you want your girlfriend to talk to you further about it, or kind of suck it up? (I’m scared of building resentment but I would like to avoid disappointments like this) "
11,"How to get to talk to people when you're feeling down?


Hiya fellas, I'll get straight to the point. I've been pretty down the last couple of weeks/months. I want to talk to people about it, like real people I know, but I don't know how to do that. I don't want them to think I'm a moaner and I don't want to get them down, I really don't know how to go about it. Even if I did talk to them, what would I say? They aren;t going to magically fix my problems. so... how to?"

20,"How do I deliver incredibly bad/sad news to my husband?


I need to inform my husband that our 12 year old dog probably has lymphoma. He doesn’t have any noticeable symptoms right now, he feels and acts completely well just the same as always. But it’s very likely at this point that in a matter of weeks or months he will suddenly become ill and decline quickly after that.

I don’t know how to tell my husband about this. He is going to be wrecked:(. I need to let him know how long we likely have and what we can expect will happen before we need to make the call to euthanize. He is somewhat introverted and prefers to be left alone when he’s dealing with harsh situations like this. I don’t want to overload him with a ton of sad information all at once. But I don’t want to deliver sadness in small increments over a longer timeframe either. Which way do you all think would be the better or most gentle choice? If you had to receive terrible news what situation would suck the least for you? "
21,"Online Dating - Guys, tell me your thoughts!


Hi guys of reddit! I rarely ever use dating apps, and I'm trying to understand how the online dating world works from a male POV. Please answer the following questions: 

&amp;#x200B;

Q1: Age and location? 

Q2: What is your relationship status?

Q3: How flirty would you say you are? (Not flirty, somewhat, moderately, huge flirt)

Q4: Have you used online dating apps like Tinder or Bumble?

Q5: What are your intentions when you use dating apps? 

Q6: If you were talking to someone and you liked her, would you still use the app to talk to other girls?

Q7: Explain the reasoning behind Q6. 

&amp;#x200B;

Thanks \~

25,"Men of Reddit, do you feel we as men deserve more compliments and attention to our insecurities?


I pour out my heart and soul into my relationship and I make sure to compliment my girlfriend, tell her I love her, spend time with her, initiate sex, and in general work to help her confidence. But I feel like it's only a one way street. I rarely, if ever, get a compliment (and when I do it's something like ""cool jacket"" or ""I like your shirt""), she never initiates sex, and in general just does nothing for my confidence. I've brought this up to her many times and have tried to explain my needs but I don't think she understands.

Does any one else relate or am I crazy? I feel like men are treated as if they're supposed to pamper their girlfriends and treat them like the fucking queen of England with nothing in return..."
