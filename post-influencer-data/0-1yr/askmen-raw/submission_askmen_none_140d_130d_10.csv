1,"What was something you learned about your partner that was a deal breaker after living with them?


Me and my girlfriend moved in together about a month ago, and everything was going well at first. Then I noticed that she goes days without washing up since she works at home. That bothered me, but I may do that myself from time to time as well so why judge her? Then one day I was looking for my keys and opened a drawer and saw LOADS of used tissue. Full of whatever she's coughed or sneezed out. I couldn't for the life of me figure out why she would be keeping this. I threw it out and didn't think anything of it. Then the next day she calls me crying, asking where her tissues went...I told her I threw them away, and she went ballistic. She drove up to my job and started yelling in front of everyone telling me not to touch her stuff and then proceeded to key my car. Needless to say I'm not with her anymore. I sent for my things about a week later and she had cut up all of my shirts and pants. I don't know why I didn't see any red flags..."

3,"At what point would your girls spending habits be a deal breaker?


My gf can’t afford her full rent on a 38k salary and yet she still eats out everyday, and will willingly drop $70 - $80 on a full price shirt or pair of jeans because “it’s cute”. 

We are still dating but she’s been making comments about combining our incomes and I’m honestly kinda scared that she will run us both into debt based on her spending habits."
4,"Just found out my wife is pregnant, now what?


As the title says, I (32m) just found out my wife (27f) is pregnant. Not very far along at all. We literally just got married in December, and while starting a family was always in our plans we weren’t even planning on trying for another year. So, here I am, with about 8 months worth of planning to make this happen. While 

I have a dad, he’s just not a very present or good one, and hers has passed. Outside of my professional life I don’t have many male mentors I can turn to about this stuff... so here I am asking reddit... wtf do I do now? What steps do I need to take? What steps should I take? How can I be the best husband possible these next 8 months? What can I do to make sure I’m the best dad possible when we get there? What books should I read? Why did I make so many I don’t have to wear condoms now that we’re married jokes? Am I supposed to keep listening to Cats in the Cradle on repeat? What should I do first?"

6,"Why do buses go PSHSHSHHTTTTT when they stop?


Ok, literally everytime I walk home from school, there's always a bus that comes past and then just explodes right next to my ear. Someone told me it was the tires letting out air so the bus could lower to let people off, but that sounds extremely stupid. So why don't cars do this??? Somone please help I'm having an existential crisis over a bus"

10,"What boosts your confidence &amp; feeling of masculinity?


Female here, my SO and I have both had major confidence issues. Over the past few years, I've working hard on it by getting into women's groups and finding support to boost my own and so far its made a profound difference in my life.

I want the same for him, but my method seems like it wouldn't fit him at all. He's a computer ""nerdy"" type, generally avoids too much social interaction, but not necessarily ""shy"" and never been into sports as long as Ive known him.

What kind of things do men do to help with self esteem/confidence/masculinity? Is it just me or are the resources for men (aside from sports) just a bit more slim?"

13,"How many men actually have or want a gaming room?


Hi fellow Redditors

I'm moving into a new flat with my gf next week and everything is going really well so far, but one thing is constantly comming up and I wonder, if that's really a thing or just something many like to dream or brag about: A gaming room.

Me and my gf are not gamers, we like to do some board or card games, but for this we just use the living room or the eating table, there's absolutely no need for a separate or special room. But many (especially men) seem to dream about that and we're not talking teenagers, we're talking men in their 30s.

I was a true gamer/LAN-party visitor when I was in my 20s, but now I just don't care about this as much anymore and I'm totally fine to use my regular office desk/PC at home to play some games every now an then. I do still have a beefy rig to properly play some new PC games, but that's it: no special room or environment.

How many of you actually have a gaming room or really want to have one somewhen in the future?"

15,"Anecdotally I've noticed a lot of male friends stay in unhappy relationships so much longer than my female friends. In your opinion, what are some of the reasons as to why?


I had a bit of an epiphany today talking in my friends group. I have so many guy friends that appear unhappy or ambivalent towards their girlfriends, just aren't in it anymore, not fulfilled. It's almost like they're paralyzed by inaction to leave, though, and are just going through the motions. 

Conversely so many girl friends I have are much quicker to leave unfulfilling relationships. It's even interesting that some of my girl friends, as they broke up, their guy partners confessed feeling the same - unhappy or just meh - and they were so happy that she pulled the trigger to initiate the break up. It's so strange, I am wondering why they can't broach the conversation themselves. Any insight?"
16,"What type of affection do you like from the person you're seeing/with?


I'm not a super affectionate person (was raised in a closed off Asian household without a lot of love lol) and I've had a few dudes mention it to me that in the past. It takes me a long time to warm up to people and even then my style is to be more reserved. I've started casually seeing this Argentinian guy who's very vocal about the fact he wants me to be more affectionate with him but I just don't know how. 

What do you guys like? Like specifically lol. Back hugs? Holding hands? Sorry that this is such a dumb question, I'm just truly, genuinely lost when it comes to this aspect of social interaction (I'm also still relatively young--as in: in college--so I'm still growing lol)."

18,"What are you actually supposed to do when you shower with a woman.


This was the first time the girl and I had done this. There a running joke between us about how awkward we are together before we get the ball running but this shit takes the cake. It ended up just being a short, moist, makeout session that could have just been done on her bed.

Do we do sexy things or showery things or both and, if so, when do we switch or combine the two? I feel so damn clueless."
19,"What are the things you guys imagine when you see a cute girl across the room?


I had a talk with my bf last night on our dinner date and I asked him:

""What was your first reaction when you saw me at Jake's birthday party?"" he asked our mutual friend to introduce him to me

He answered me with this:

""I was imagining future with you, kids, vacations with you and waking up to your very pretty face in all my mornings.""


Do guys really do this though?  I thought guys would normally be thinking like ""Damn, I wanna bed her asap"" lol. Anyways, my heart was so full last night even if it's just him being silly again haha ♥️"
20,"How can I properly show I’m attracted to a girl?

23,"My boyfriend has taken care of me as I was unwell- how do I thank him? Everything I think of seems pathetic after I think of how he helped me.


Hi Men :)

My boyfriend has just taken care of me so well. He insisted I go to the doctor, carried me in as I was very dizzy, listened to my awful symptoms, made sure I got the medication I needed then over the next few days he has helped me bathe, use the bathroom, taken care of my pets and been my absolute saviour. 

A very good example- I fainted in the parking lot as he was carrying me to the car and it was terrifying but even as I lost consciousness he was there comforting me.

I'm so in love with him it hurts my heart, and I want to thank him. 

How can I convey how much he means to me and how thankful I am that he was there for me? 

What would make you feel appreciated and special after helping someone so much? 

Thank you for your help :)"
24,"What up with guys loving their head and beard being scratched?


My boyfriend becomes a litteral cat whenever I start scratching his beard on petting his head. He scratches my head but it does not seem to have the same level of pleasure (non sexual) that it brings him. What's up with that?  Do you men of reddit experience the same thing?"

This ethos has stuck with me well into my adult life. I am constantly negating my achievements as the ‘99 goals’ and focus aggressively on incidents I perceive to be the ‘missed 1’. I feel like I’ll never be able to fully appreciate my achievements unless I change my thought process, yet I don’t know how to without feeling arrogant."

35,"How did you stop being ""the quiet type?""


27 year old guy here. I tend to stay pretty quiet at work and only focus on my job. This usually leads to people acting off put by my presence and a general feeling of uptightness. I haven't had a friend since maybe junior year of high school so I don't really know how to associate with other guys. I have a wife, but that's just not the same as Male bonding.

 I hate always being so quiet and being the awkward weird dude. When I do get recognized and interaction starts I'm usually overly excited and may come off as completely fake which then keeps me in a loop of never being able to make lasting friendships. 

How did you break your quietness and become a more well rounded and grounded man?"

37,"How to be Intimate with Zero Relationship Experience


I’m a 24 year old guy and I’ve never kissed a girl before. No confidence and varying degrees of depression since I was 14, but I’m better now. I’m healthy and active and not too bad looking, according to a gay friend and my brothers ex. I’m feeling good, focusing on improving myself. It’s showing.

I’ve just been in a dark hole through the early times of my life when I should have been becoming familiar with intimacy, and now I feel like my inexperience is almost immediately noticeable and it becomes a feedback loop in my head in real time. I’m fairly uncomfortable in even the most innocent of 1 on 1 situations with a girl and it shows.

You go out with your crush and she convinces you to fuck on the first date, she calls you up again but only to fuck. You ask her if she wants to do other things and hang outside, eat together, but she says no and only wants to fuck. She passive aggressively kicks you out of place every time you guys finish
