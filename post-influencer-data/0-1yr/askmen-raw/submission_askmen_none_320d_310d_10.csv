12,"TMen of Reddit, I've just filed a police report against my Half-Brother. Those of you who have to file criminal charges against a sibling. Why did you do it and how has it affected you?


Hi Men of Reddit, i was hoping to get some clarity on this and also a little support. I'm diagnsoed on the Autism spectrum and am actively treated and medicated for ADHD, thus i am routinely in possession of a highly restricted substance. My Half-Brother ( 40 years old ) who is living with my family at the moment, has been regularly in and out of rehab for drug and alcohol problems and been the subject of other criminal related matters, has just stolen and consumed 6 days worth of my medication. I notified my parents, apparently they were already aware and decided not to tell me, i had not used the bag i keep a 7 day supply of medication in, for a little over a week. I'm in a crunch time at the moment with final exams this upcoming week at University and having to confront my brother and knowing that personal space was completely violated, has completely sent my head through a spin. Given that my exams are approaching ive applied for special considerations on my exam this week, for this type of sitatuation, policy dictates that a police report and supporting documentation had to be provided.

 I've effectively just reported my brother to the police for stealing and consuming a schedule 8 restricted substance. Not sure if charges will be pressed, but in the event that they are and part of me feels that they should be, id like to hear about your experiences to better understand and hopefully see my situation more objectively."

15,"Met a really cool girl, what do I do?


I (19M) was traveling to see my gf (18F) a few weeks ago who's now at uni which is roughly a 3.5 hour trip to see her. I really care about her but the distance is becoming an issue but I haven't told her yet. Also as bad as it sounds I miss the intimacy as we could see each other everyday before... However I was traveling back from Manchester last week which is only about 30 minutes away and I was seeing some of my mates at uni. So me any my buddy realized how close it was until my train was going to leave from the station, so I sprinted for a good 5 minutes to get on the train, as I was sprinting a girl (21F) was doing the same behind me.

So we both get onto the train and she sits down first, there weren't many seats left but she seemed cute so i asked if it was okay to sit by her and she said it was okay, we start talking about how far it was to sprint and having a joke at how each other is so red... she's so easy to talk to and we chatted for a good hour and a half after we got off the train, we chat about the usual sort of rubbish like music, hobbies, drugs and general chit-chat. At that moment I realised shes so much more like me than my current gf, same music taste, enjoys going to amsterdam (for the culture....). What do I do????????

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

tl;dr current gf moved over 3 hours away, met a really cool girl on the train who i get along with better than my current gf. How do i go about things?"

18,"How do I stop people from mistaking assuming I'm gay?


I'd like to preface this way theres nothing wrong with being gay at all.

I'm a 21M who's currently in university right now, and a lot of my friends, and strangers people seem to think I'm gay (for the record i'm 100% straight).

It's getting to the point where if theres gay guy at a party, they'll jokingly try to make some sort of implication about it. I've actually asked a few of my close friends why and they've all said the same thing. Basically, i'm naturally flirtatious and expressive to everyone, and i'm very well groomed and dressed (i've had an interest in fashion and clothing for years) and i'm relatively lean/fit. They've also stated that in parties, I end up talking to guys more than girls. This isn't because I'm interested in guys, it's just that I'm really not the biggest fan of approaching/hitting on girls in a party setting where we're both drunk.

I'm currently single, but I've been in long term relationships before, and I'm not exactly the type to sleep around on one night stands (not really my thing).

Has anyone had this issue before, and how do I change people's perception on me? I'm getting pretty annoyed at people constantly telling me that it's okay to come out of the closet, even though i've insisted multiple times i'm 100% straight"
