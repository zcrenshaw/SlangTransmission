0,"What do you guys do with girls who are late for dates?


I had a date planned with a girl for 6pm. She called at 4pm saying she will be at my place at 6:30pm. I accepted and gave her a chance because she let me know early and it was only 30 mins.

At 6:22pm she messaged me saying ""I'm going to be late haha"".

I waited until 6:50pm and replied, ""I'm glad you find it funny, forget it.""

She reads my message 40 mins later then rings me at 7:25pm. She says she is ready in which I reply, ""That's great but I've already cancelled dinner."" 

She laughed and said that I need to stop being so proud and that I should accept it because 'she's always late'.

I got no apology and when I asked why she was late she couldn't give me a straight answer. I told her I'm not going to stand being treated like that and that I value my time.

My question is, am I really *crazy* for cancelling?

I've decided to move on from her."

2,"How do I tactfully ask my SO to put effort into her appearance again?


We’ve been dating for going on five years, and I guess comfortability and familiarity are the main culprits. There’s probably not an all around positive way to ask my SO to do this, but I’ll try. I’ve done the “we should work out together route,” along with a few more well known tactful ways. Her job doesn’t require employees to look put together, and over the past couple years, she’s ended up taking full advantage of that, slowly. This attitude at work seems to have slowly worked its way into every aspect of her life. I’m all for body and image positivity, but even when we have a date, there’s just no effort on her part anymore. I can’t remember a time in the past two years when she’s done anything more than yoga pants and a t-shirt on a date. Weight gain has been a pretty big issue too. 

I’ve addressed these things before, and we’ve never came across as an asshole about it, but it’s getting to the point where I’m just not attracted to her most of the time. 

So guys, what do I do?"

4,"We've had plenty of ""How do I become comfortable with being single"" posts. But what about the opposite? How do you motivate yourself to be social and bond with others when you have no problem with being absolutely alone?


I don't mean just being introverted either- I mean having absolutely no friends, dates, family, absolutely NO ONE and still not caring. How do you change that?"

6,"My balls just dunked into the water of a toilet bowl for the first in my life. Reddit, how do you handle micro-existential crises?


It was my non-overflowing home toilet that I use everyday.

Is this something that just happens to men as they get older, that their balls just start to sag? Why the hell didn't they cover this in sex-ed instead of spending 90% of the course on fallopian tubes and non-HPV STD's? I'm only 24, I thought my body wasn't supposed to start to crap out on me until **at least** my 30's.

I'm terrified of going back to the backroom again, do I have just cup my balls while I'm in the bathroom for the rest of my life? This is so much more worse than a Poseidon's Kiss or my pene touching the rim, at least when those happen I'm not reminded of our inevitable slow march towards the end."
7,"What's the worst ways in which you've seen social media affect the women in your life?


I've been reading a lot lately about how social media seems to have a [detrimental impact on teenage girls] (https://www.forbes.com/sites/alicegwalton/2018/03/20/social-media-may-be-more-psychologically-harmful-to-girls-than-boys/) particularly (boys don't seem to be as affected by it.) I'm wondering how many of you have observations about this from your own lives, and not just with teenage girls - adults too maybe. In what ways have you seen it negatively impact the women you know, if it has?"
8,"Guys who have accidentally knocked out your girflriend/wife, what happened?


So this happened yesterday.  My girlfriend has been doing MMA, kickboxing, and judo for the past 6 years. Her and I spar occasionally. She's fairly small at 5'4"" and 125lbs whereas I'm 6' and 190lbs. She always tells me to not take it easy on her but I always make sure to pull my punches because even though she's trained and I'm not, I'm still much bigger than her and don't want to hurt her. Well yesterday, we were sparring like we do and we started goofing off a bit and I started spamming spinning backfists intentionally not getting anywhere close to her. Well either she was attempting to move in to strike or come in with a surprise takedown (she says she doesn't remember) and timed it wrong and I caught her flush on the jaw. Her legs immediately went limp and she flopped to the ground completely unconscious.  I immediately knelt down next to her and started calling her name trying to wake her up. She finally came to after about a minute and was out of it. She knew her name and where she was but had no idea what happened so I took her straight to the ER and got her checked out. She'll be okay, just needs to rest and take it easy. I can't shake this guilty feeling though. I know it was a total accident and I'm not a bad person for what happened, but it still feels bad. She's been knocked out two other times during her combat sports career so it's not new to her and she's been totally cool about it joking around about it and all that. I try to joke about it too with her, but I still feel terrible about it. Has anyone else ever accidentally knock your girlfriend/wife out cold? If so, how did you get over the guilt even knowing it was completely accidental?"

11,"Gentlemen: When are you intimidated by a woman?


A female friend and I were discussing this, and she told me that only ever gets hit on when she is wearing no makeup and wearing baggy gym clothes, going to and from the gym. She will have men honking at her, attempting to talk to her, stopping traffic etc, the most ridiculous of attention.

However, when she is all dressed up in a pencil skirt and silk blouse with cute heels, with a Veronica Lake wavy hairstyle, and out with her friends, men never approach her ever.

If a woman looks quite polished and presentable, do you find that intimidating as opposed to a casual, relaxed, sweat pants style? 

What are some instances in which you found a woman intimidating? (could also be situational)"

13,"Men, how do you deal with the possibility you might be single forever?


I'm 26M. And I have a lot of insecurities in both my personal and professional life. I do not feel like I'm in the right place for a relationship, but that doesn't stop me from craving companionship. I haven't done much meeting anyone new. That's my fault. And I'm also getting tired of waiting for the right person to just show up. I'm worried I might still be alone at age 30, 35. I look at my own parents and they got married at age 28. Being 30 is only 4 years away. Considering the last 4 years went by in a blink of an eye, it's a very real possibility. And it scares me. How do you stop craving companionship or stop worrying about being single well into your 30s and 40s?"

24,"Have you ever been falsely accused of sexual harassment/abuse and what ended up happening?


I've been watching John Oliver's new video about workplace sexual harassment. Towards the end of it, he interviews Anita Hill who, 27 years ago, testified to the Senate Judiciary Committee about her horrible experience with one of her bosses. In that interview, she briefly talks about false claims but believes they're so rare they're not even worth making rules about it. 

Sexual abuse and harassment is to me a very big problem, but as a woman I'm not familiar with the male perspective of it, particularly on the issue of false claims. So I have to ask: have you been accused of something you didn't do, what ended up happening, and how common do you find situations like this to be?
