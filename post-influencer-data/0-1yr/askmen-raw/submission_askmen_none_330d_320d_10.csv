I lost a bunch of friends today because I decided to stay friends with a guy who I’ve known over two years who was falsely accused of something. Curious about how this kind of thing affects other guys’ lives."

3,"What made you finally get your life together?


I’m currently 18, working a job I only do for the money (even though bad), studying for a career that I know won’t fulfil me much at all and it’s just such a draining experience. I know deep down I want and I even could pursue what I’m passionate about but family, commitment and an unknown future stops me almost immediately. I’m scared of pursuing what I really enjoy and also scared of the regret that I might feel in the future if I don’t do it. "

8,"How to deal with loneliness?


Hello everyone on r/askmen, I've got one simple question. How do you deal with loneliness? For me it's getting quite difficult.

I'm 18 at college in the UK, and am taking an extra year of education before going to university. However, this means that most of my friends have left and are no longer in contact. The people that are here still often travel from far away seeing as I live in a small city. My best mate, whom I have known for 13 years has left and I see him rarely, like many others. Personally, I don't deal with loneliness well. I spiralled into depression last year but have since gotten back on to my feet. How can I stop this from happening again?

Thanks in advance for your replies.

10,"How to get out of first date hell in college?


It's my second year of college, and I feel like I'm in first date hell. It's been easy for me to flirt, get girls' #s, and go on dates, but after 2-3 dates, it fizzles out EVERY single time. Either they lose interest, I lose interest, or the momentum fades due to every day life. 

I'm in a fraternity, do well in school, play guitar, am in the best shape of my life, have a good group of friends, but at the same time, I feel like I'm the opposite of what girls think the ""stereotype"" is. I don't dress like a fratboy, hate the bar scene/rap music, one night stands, and generally just fucking around. 

I hate being stuck in limbo and am not the type of guy to just use girls for fun. I'm not sure if it's a maturity thing or value thing, but most girls I see seem to want some casual fling and nothing more.

And no I don't talk about getting serious on the first couple of dates. I just try to have fun and get to know them "
11,"Is this the point where I break up with my girlfriend?


 

More or less, I’m not sure if I should break up with my girlfriend. We’ve been dating for several months, and it started off very well; we hit it off nice, the usual happy stuff. A couple of weeks into “dating”, she told me a few sad and unfortunate things about her past, I won’t share here obviously, but you all get the point. I was surprised that she told me all this so early, we weren’t even officially dating at that point, but it appeared that she had recovered well since those times. That and any other time the first few months, she was fine talking, communication was good, and everything was great.

About one month ago, cancer she had had in the past returned. The treatment is going well, and her chances for recovery are very high; the medicines she took however increased the amount of time she spent sleeping, which emphasized some other problems she had been having. Her job has her work later in the evening, and she frequently will pull all-nighters to sometimes study for her classes, but also for parties. As a result, she has literally no sleep schedule, and skips many of her classes. She sleeps in the day often, basically whenever she can since she started taking the medicines. Due to this, most times I see her, she is tired, and often we just talk for a few minutes, and she’ll just go to sleep. She likes when I sleep with her, so sometimes, if she actually is going to bed at a normal hour, we’ll go to bed together. But that’s it, we just sleep. Little to no conversation, little to no “physical” things, just sleep. This began to wear on me, but I figured I would try to be supportive, after all, she wasn’t quite like this before the cancer returned, it’s hard to blame her, right?

Then recently, two people close to her died. This of course hit her really hard. To cope however, she drinks. She has always had a love for alcohol, slightly more love for it than I thought healthy, but she managed it properly. Until now. She copes by getting drunk with her family and avoiding conversation. The past week, she stopped by once to get some things, and she said it was the first time she had been sober in 4 days. And guess what she did then; she went to sleep after us talking for ten minutes. Aside from that, I haven’t seen her for a week. I have tried to talk with her via text, but she replied that she was in a bad emotional state (obviously) and would rather not talk at the moment. Another time a few days ago, she asked me to FaceTime her later that day, and I did, but she declined the call. When I asked her why she did that and if she was alright, she didn’t even reply. That, out of all this, is the thing that made me actually angry, that she wouldn’t even take the one minute to reply to her boyfriend about why she declined my call after asking me to do so.

So now we’re at the point I am today. It feels difficult to blame her almost; in a few weeks, the cancer she thought she had beat returned, and two people close to her died. It somewhat makes since that she would withdraw to an extent, but it feels like she isn’t even here anymore. If this is what it had been like originally, I obviously would not be dating her still. But I have seen what she is like without these extreme problems, and I miss how it was the first couple of months before this all happened. So I almost want to stay, support her through this, and hope that she recovers well enough. But it’s exhausting; now I don’t really have anyone to talk to at a deeper level like it was with her, and at this point I can’t really talk to her at all about anything. So what am I supposed to do at this point?

tldr: Girlfriend becomes significantly less intimate in all ways due to unavoidable circumstances, how long am I supposed to try to support her?"

I may be having a girl stay the night with me soon. I've had other GF's stop by to simply to hangout out or for a quickie, but I've never had anyone sleep with me before.

Is there any sort of proper etiquette in these types of situations? I know making breakfast is a nice gesture. Is there anything else I could be doing to make sure she feels comfortable and more welcome?"

So... why don't you act like a friend any more or at least distance yourself when you see me with other guys? Is it that you weren't my friend in the first place or what?"
