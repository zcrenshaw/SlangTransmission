0,"ask to show interest or better to not ask?


I don’t know anything about video games or computers but my boyfriend is in love with both topics. Even tho I don’t get the appeal, or really understand anything, I like to ask questions about it every now and again to show that I understand this is something he likes and that’s important to me. I’ve picked up on a few things from doing this so now I can ask more intelligent questions and sometimes (rarely) can point out something! But I’m getting worried that I’m annoying. Do you guys like when people ask questions about your interests or is it more annoying than anything? "

Had this discussion with my buddies and heard some pretty odd answers because we all have different routines and have them tended to our own tastes. 

Personally, I can't leave in the morning if I didn't take a 10 minute crap.

3,"How do some guys move from one relationship to another so easily?


I know not all men are like this, and that some women are guilty of such, but I want to ask. After a four-year long relationship with an ex, he moved on to a new girl within two weeks. Meanwhile, its been three months since the break up (that I initiated) and I'm terrified to be in a relationship again. Recently, one guy was really into me, but I couldn't bear to devote myself to another relationship. Just knowing he liked me made me anxious, and I cut ties with him quickly. 

I don't miss my ex, in fact, I haven't loved him in a long time, but how do some men find it so easy to move on? My dad is the same way. After he divorced my mom, he was married again within months. I just don't get it, especially from an emotional perspective.

The guy that liked me recently said that I may be slightly traumatized from my last meaningful relationship. Unfortunately, this may be true. My ex never listened to me, he was always wanting sex, he argued with me a lot, and many other little things that developed into bad habits I've adopted, such as apologizing a lot or asking permission to do things. Maybe I'm scared I'll run into another guy like him."

5,"(NSFW) M(28) Getting pains in my testicles when I don't come.


Ok so I'm not sure if this is normal or just me.

Sometimes when I'm with a girl be it hanging out or cuddling I can get hard intermittently, that's fairly natural cos she's attractive. If it's not a situation where it leads to sex and my dicks been up and down like a yoyo I start to get ball ache really bad. It can be hard to beat one out but eventually it's a huge intense orgasm.

Weird thing is it's only when I'm with a girl, day to day errections that occur are fine and I don't ache.

Any advice or anyone with a similar experience?"

10,"What can I do during this gym date?


There's this Spanish girl at my gym. I overheard her talking about some guy but I don't know if it's her ex or bf. Anyway she and I talk a lot and we're planning to work out together next week. We normally get in or leave at the same time so usually our hands touch eachothers shoulder and back while we're squeezing through the tiny locker area. So touching shoulder/back is normal for us. Next week she wants me to show her a few exercises. Obviously we're going to be staring at eachothers body. No complaints but I'd like to have some physical contact if it won't be awkward.

Is there any exercises that'd give me a reason to have my hand on her lower back? or to feel her arms? anything? My thinking is if she is enjoying it all it'd be a good idea to ask her out on a date. If she isn't then I'll touch less/not at all and maybe ask her if she's single. I just don't want to ask her if she's single, find out she has a bf and then feel awkward the rest of the time I see her which is every week"

12,"How do you break out of the cycle of self-pity and resentment?



I’m having trouble letting go and forgiving a friend who took advantage of me during a period when I was down on my luck and needed someone to turn to; even though they’ve shown themselves to be a better person afterwards. Said person repeatedly went out of their way to humiliate me in front of other people to bolster their own social status (saying things like “you’re inferior/lesser/not worth keeping around, etc.) and attacked facets of my identity that were important to me when my self-esteem was already shaky. I ended up finding my way in the end, but it left permanent scars on my psyche. Those words became a part of reoccurring insecurities I can’t seem to beat and still hurt even when they no longer apply. 

It’s been well over a year since all this happened and I still wince when I think about it; I’ve tried chocking it up as a loss and moving on but I can’t. It’s like my subconscious won’t forgive me for not standing up for myself. I’m embarrassed that I let playground level drama destroy me. I don’t vent about it to friends because I know it’s petty bs, but my misplaced anger gets confused, turns inwards and reopens the wound every time I have to confront my own inherent limitations.

So r/AskMen, where do I go from here? "

20,"How can I increase my self esteem?


I work out regularly, and I’m in an ongoing weight loss journey since my job offers free personal training.
In the past I’ve gone through a particularly painful breakup, and I’ve spent a lot of that time recovering. Working out helps my self esteem a bit, but how can I increase my self esteem and image of myself in a better way? I’d like to be more “macho” without being an asshole.
I’m naturally introverted, so in the past I’ve let people walk all over me. I’ve been better about putting boundaries down, but I’m just curious what advice r/AskMen could give me!"

22,"Dealing with a break up and the fact my ex gf told all our friends about my kinks?


I’m 18, my ex gf 19 and i recently broke up. We both go to the same small university, and share a group of friends. 

One of my guy friends told me after our breakup she told the whole group how I like water sports and some very specific details about what I like in bed. He and one of the other guys called her out for sharing that kind of info. But that doesn’t change the fact that all our friends know what I like in bed. Somethings are meant to remain private.

How do I go about facing everyone, without giving it away I’m so fucking embarrassed. I know some embarrassing stuff about her, but I would never think of telling anyone, and I won’t. I just don’t know where to go from here."
23,"Fellas! Where do you draw the line between dignity and willingness to see things through?


One thing I've wondered is how to find the right spot between not putting myself in positions where I \*think\* I am (\*or could\*) being taken advantage of, and being open-minded and being accommodating to the (dating)pursuit process. I try to put my personal preservation first and mitigate emotional risk to the point that I believe I end up cutting things short too often. 

In effect, I'm suspicious to the point of being suspicious that the suspicion may be destructive in my relationships. 

\*\*A current example of this(not required for the conversation): 

I recently matched on Tinder with a young lady. Conversation was really good, as I thought. She told me she was deleting her tinder, but gave me her number. We continued texting, and after a couple weeks, we eventually met for a date. The date went well, I dropped her off at home, and went my way. The following day I open up tinder, and happen to see in the feed that she'd changed her pictures and bio, adding wording along the lines of ""I dont like fancy people""(I don't think I'm a fancy guy in the least). I texted her, like I normally would, but no response.

Didn't hear from her that whole day.

Another day passes. And she texts me late in the evening. I have yet to respond.

In this situation, I process this as her not being interested, maybe stringing things along out of boredom. My immediate reaction is always to avoid emotional strain, so here, I would quit talking to her altogether. But I'm attempting to be critical of my thought process, and thought to ask, since this is something that comes to mind often.

TLDR; How do you guys determine when to leave situations alone? What general guidelines do you use to find where your breaking point is?"

26,"How tired are you of the online dating app culture?


I think I have an answer, or at least an alternative option, to the saturated dating app scene. But I want to get an idea if this is worth my time to pursue. So assuming you're totally frustrated with the online dating scene, how would you feel about signing up for a scavenger hunt with one random girl at a time?

Sounds crazy - but hear me out:

Let's say over the course of 2 hours or so, you're ""matched"" up with a random girl every 15 minutes (or guy! whatever you're into). Matches are created based off the profile you submit in order to participate in this event. So you have to complete X amount of challenges (clue, riddles, scavenger hunt shit) for a given set of time and then you swap out to the next match...simple, fun, adventurous.

So think the amazing race meets speed dating. The idea is you're finding like minded people - girls who like to do more than just watch netflix and brunch - because they signed up for the event too. And you're getting to know them on a  different level than just asking what they do for work. \*Bonus you don't have to buy anyone a drink to impress them\* You'll meet a handful of matches in 2 hours - saving you time from penpal-ing on the apps forever. And then after, everyone who participated meets up at the local bar for happy hour to meet the ppl they didnt get matched with for the challenges - you can buy her a drink  then.

Is this something you'd be interested in? What are your thoughts on an event like this? "
