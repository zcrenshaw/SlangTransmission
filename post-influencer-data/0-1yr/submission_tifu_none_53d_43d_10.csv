"TIFU By agreeing to an “open relationship”


Obviously a throwaway. 

To put things into perspective, I (M 20) and my GF (F 21) had been dating/together for four and a bit years. Typical high school sweethearts, we wanted to move away and start our own lives after college. 

We decide to spice things up a bit and “open” up our relationship a little. It was pretty much a join decision but looking back she was kind of insistent on the whole “sex is fun” idea.

She is on a night out with some friends when she phones me and asks if the whole open relationship thing is still cool, explaining she’s met a guy (M 24) and asks for me to pay for a hotel because she wasn’t working at the time. I agreed. I tell her to go for it, and she does. She texts me to say she had a good night and that all was well.

The week after, she mentions she’s meeting up with this guy again. Wasn’t expecting it but I’m cool with it. Again, asks for me to pay for her hotel. A decision I would live to regret. She doesn’t text me the entire night. Weird, but okay maybe she’s just having a good time?

The next day I receive a load of messages about how she needs a “break” from “everything” right now. Meeting this guy has apparently opened her eyes. A little more conversation and we’re over. She’s completely cut me out of her life. I check her snap chat story, and of course, she’s with him. I’ve heard from her friends that they’re dating now. 

TLDR; Agreed to an open relationship, basically paid for my girlfriend to find someone better and dump me."
"TIFU by forgetting to log out of reddit


TIFU by saving my reddit log in to the computer at my work. I forgot to deselect the box that remembers my log in information and now my co-worker and anyone who uses the work computer has access to my reddit account and can do whatever they want. In fact, I don't even know I've FU yet. My co-worker is hoping that I discover that I FU when I receive replies to this post. Reddit, please let me know I've FU and give my coworker recommendations of how to increase the consequences of staying logged in.

TL;DR: I forgot to log out of my reddit and now my co-worker can do what ever they want, like say the true user of this account has a small penis. But it's coming from me so you know it's credible, and that I, u/MisterWhisler_ am not the slightest bit hung."
"TIFU by deciding to hook up with my Tinder date only to get knocked the fuck


This happened last night. I'll keep it short and simple.

I am super uncomfortable with hooking up on the first date. It's not my style and I usually need to really get to know someone before I do.

After a really great date filled with laughing fits and shared humour. I felt like I clicked with this girl. As the day died out it was obvious I had to drive her home.

She asked if she could come over just to snoop my fridge and watch our favourite show.

(instantly getting the oh shit I'm getting laid vibes but in reality I just wanted to do exactly as she mentioned)

We get to my place and we have some food and relax. Soon enough we busted out a little wine.

Time fly's and we're busy laughing and I look at the clock. It's 1 am. I have not kissed or even touched this girl all night.

I tell her I got get to bed and I'll have to drive her home in the morning. I fetch her a blanket because I just want to show her respect that I don't expect her to climb in bed with me. I drop the blanket and turn around and feel her hand grab mine. She's following me.

(que the oh shit shakes I always get)

The first kiss was explosive we started making out in a way I've never liked more. It was just awesome. We were going at it so hard we didn't turn a light on everything and we stumble into my bed.

5 minutes or so into this intense session she wants to get on top and promptly trys to spin me on my back. Throwing me directly off the bed, head fucking first.

I was out cold and I slowly regain consciousness to this cute soul in full blown tears thinking she just killed her date.

I slowly get up with her help and climb into bed gripping my head. She let's out apology after apology and I slowly whispered ""Jesus fuck hulk hogan over here"" and continued to kiss her and wipe the tears.

We both started laughing like crazy and well we finished the enevitable with my bruised head.

tldr: hooked up with my Tinder roommate and she tossed me off my bed in the dark and knocked me out"
"TIFU by tipping my pizza delivery driver $1100


So today I sold my bitcoin I bought 2 years ago I spent like $100 on the investment or something, I cashed it out at a bitcoin atm and brought it home the first thing I did to celebrate was buy some edibles. I buy some edibles eat a whole brownie and am out of it, I order some pizza and take some money from my wad and put it in a pile on the table next to me total was like 20 so I put 23.

Since I'm high af the pizza delivery girl knocks I grab the wad of all the money not the $23 stack. I give it to her and she starts crying she keeps saying are you sure you dont know how much this I'd going to help me. Freaked out and high I say okay and just rush inside.

Right now after waking up being passed out I realize what I've done, gave away my bill money for this month lol.

TL;DR - I tipped my pizza delivery driver $1100 while high on brownie edibles by accident and have no money to pay for my Bill's now"
"TIFU- By not knowing about sunblock expiration dates


I applied SPF 100 sport spray, every hour (give or take) for roughly 4 hours. I was hanging out at the lake and at slightly higher elevations so the water reflection and elevation probably increased the damage. 

I pretty much had no idea that I had a problem until I scratched an itch on my back and it hurt really bad. I considered for a split second that I had a burn but like an idiot, I rationalized it as ""sunblock burned the broken skin from the scratch"". 

The blisters formed by the next day and I started reading the can to see if I missed something about applying it. I found the customer service number and called it. Before talking to anyone, I heard a recording tell me that the FDA doesn't require expiration dates on sunblock and to consider it expired after 3 years. This bottle was easily 4-5 years old.

I had no clue. 

I went to the doc and got some amazing medicated gauze and they sent me home with pain meds after cleaning the burn off and showing everyone in the building. 

It was easily one of the most painful things I have ever experienced. Except when my tank top straps got dried to my blisters on my shoulders and became part of the blister scabs overnight. Trying to pull them off was almost blackout pain. I soaked in a tub for a while until they basically melted off. 


This was preventable- Sunblock expires, please check yours and make sure you store it according to the instructions. 


TL;DR- Sunblock expires."
"TIFU by attempting suicide without realizing it


So, as I was making myself breakfast this morning, I for some reason started wondering what would happen if I touched one of the glowing wires inside the toaster while it was on. Being the very intelligent man I am, I of course did not want to touch it with my bare hands. I instead took a fork out of the drawer and without thinking, sticked it right into the toaster. A small bolt of electricity shot up from the toaster and the toaster shut itself off.

The worst part is, I still didn't realize what I had actually just done. I just thought, ""uh huh, whatever"" and put the fork back into the drawer. As I grabbed the bread it clicked on me that there is a current running through the wires and that I had almost electrocuted myself. Maybe I was saved by my other hand not being on the dishwashing table, which is made of metal. If I had been  leaning against the tabletop to reach the toaster better, I would have gotten an electric shock.

I haven't told anyone yet, and I don't think I will.

Tl;dr: Curiosity almost killed the cat."
"TIFU by forgetting babies exist.


So I’ve been spending A LOT of time around dogs. I’ve recently been hired by friends families and family friends to walk or watch their dogs. My reddit is COVERED in dogs from various sources. My Facebook is solely dog pages and dog-related charities. Basically everywhere I turn, I see dog. Not a bad life to live. Until yesterday (YIFU I know). I walked one of my mother’s friends dog to a dog friendly pub and sat in the garden enjoying a drink and the sun. It wasn’t very busy with only a few other people sat outside around me. It’s hot. I’ve just walked in the sun for maybe 20 minutes, stupidly, without water. I want to blame dehydration for this FU, but really I know I’m just an idiot. A couple of young ladies are sat a few tables away from me, talking and cooing over a pushchair. My first thought is that in that pushchair... is a dog. I don’t know. It’s a hot day and I’ve seen dogs in pushchairs before. Maybe they didn’t want its paws on hot tarmac. Maybe they’re just a little extra. Regardless, the thought that babies exist didn’t enter my tiny stupid brain. As they got up to leave and walk by me, I decided to be a friendly fellow dog walker and looked up at them, uttered the words “What breed is it?” and gestured towards the pushchair. They looked very confused, and slightly offended, and proceeded to hurry away. It was a baby. A HUMAN baby. I’m so glad they took the traditional British approach of confused stare and silence. If they had said something I think I would have disintegrated on the spot. It was a long walk home after that and thankfully, I didn’t pass anymore pushchairs. 

TL;DR I asked a woman what breed her baby was after seeing one too many dog on the Internet."
"TIFU by fulfilling a cuckolds fantasy


Obligatory this is a throwaway and this happened last winter yada yada yada.

&amp;#x200B;

 I had this couple matched on tinder for a while, never messaged them before, never really cared for the idea but I still swiped out of boredom. They were listed about mid 30's, and the woman was big, but had huuuuuuge boobs. Couldn't see her face, but that didn't matter to me. Only boob. There was no picture of her husband. I take a few shots and message them.  After like an hour of talking, I decide to just do it. We never traded any other pictures, the conversation was only about sex. She wanted me to have sex with her while her husband watched. At first I was like really not for it, I originally had no intention  of actually doing anything but more and more it didn't feel like it was me at the wheel, and I was at the peak of not caring what happened to me, even if it resulted in something tragic. At 2AM I left the house, and this is where I regret everything. 

&amp;#x200B;

After driving for about an hour, I miss their street  by a turn, and decide to turn back around through a parking lot, and while doing so drove over a curb that popped TWO of my tires. I'm in a shitty ghetto town that I've never been to, with two popped tires, not a fucking clue how I'm getting home now. I thought I was going to have to sleep in the car and call a friend and make up some story the next day. But since there was no turning back now, I decide to just walk the rest of the way to the couples house.

The husband is there waiting for me, and as soon as I see him, my gut and inner voice are SCREAMING at me, don't do this, turn back. And I wish I had listened. For reasons unknown, I followed him into the house. It was pitch black, not a single light was on. He lead me down into the basement, unsurprisingly it reeks of must and beef stew. I was unsure if they were going to rob and kill me or if this was just normal to them. If there was ever a time I disassociated, it was then and there. It was no longer me behind the wheel. The dude leads me to their bed, and shines a flashlight on his wife. Does anybody remember the scene in Blade where he shines the light on that mega obese vampire? That was what I saw. A disgusting ogre wildebeest, with a crooked line of teeth. I was horrified but at the same time, I didn't care. They both fucking STINK, that was one of the worst things. The smell took forever to wash off my hands after. Months later I'll get a whiff out of nowhere. That disgusting beef stew and body odor smell. 

I take off my clothes and get in bed with her, meanwhile the husband is talking THE ENTIRE TIME, like fucking Gollum. Saying things like ""yeah it's been a while since she's had another. Look at that beautiful pussy. Ain't she so fuckin wet?"" Nonstop. Meanwhile shining the flashlight on both of us to get a look. Like I said before, it didn't feel like it was me at the wheel, I managed to perform to a degree but I never did finish. It probably didn't help I was wearing a condom but I'm extremely glad I was. The entire time there's about 5 different things running through my head at the same time.""How the fuck am I getting home? This smell is going to kill me. How do I end this? How do I get out of here?"" 

I decided it was time, I had to get the fuck out of there asap. I told them I couldn't cum, it wasn't going to happen. They insisted I put it in her ass, and me being a polite dude, didn't want to offend them, obliged. I just wanted to make it look like I at least tried. If the smell was bad before, it took on an entirely new dimension with the smell of shit burning the hairs in my nose. I pulled out and of course there was a fat wad of shit glued to the head of my dick. I stuck it back in to hopefully wipe it off inside her asshole and called it quits. I politely reiterated I wasn't going to be able to finish. I blamed it on my tires being popped and I was too tired. They were cool about it, and I quickly gathered my things and left. 

I BARELY had the money for a tow truck driver to get home, and at least he got a kick out of the story. So we both had something to talk about for the hour long drive home. My hands reeked for at least another week, no matter how many showers I took and how many times I washed them. I blame it on a poor mental state with lack of self care for doing what I did. It took many months for me to even think about sex without being able to smell them. Easily the biggest regret of my life, and probably ruined sex for me for forever. 

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR; Drove an hour to pop both my tires in a shitty mystery ghetto town, then had traumatizing sex with a female version of Shrek while her husband shined a flashlight on us and muttered the entire time."
"TIFU by labeling the breast milk in the fridge ""Freshly Squeezed Titty Juice""


The repercussions happened today, the labeling of the titty juice was done yesterday.

My wife and I have a newborn and we've been calling her breast milk 'titty juice' from the moment she came out.  We found it funny and as we're finding out right now, having something to laugh about when you have a newborn around is very precious.

While I was at the office today my mother in law, who is a very strict and traditional Asian lady came over to help my wife out and give her a bit of a rest.  That rest was very short lived.  The baby decided it was hungry so grandma reached into the fridge to grab a package of breast milk...

When she read ""Freshly Squeezed Titty Juice 21/07/2019"" she lost her got damn mind.  She woke my wife up and aggressively expressed thoughts on how her one and only grand child is going to be corrupt from the get go.  Raised with no manners or respect.  She then left the house saying she doesn't know if she can come back.

My wife in the other hand, besides being extremely tired has had some of the hormonal challenges that can come from giving birth and getting reamed out by her mom was a tipping point.  She passed on the reaming over the phone (not the norm for her) with pretty much the gusto as her mother.

I didn't get upset because I'm not the one who squeezed out a 7.5lb creature that does not keep a schedule, respect your time and is completely dependent on you for its very survival.

TL;DR  I labeled the breast milk a crude and offensive name.  Now I have an even more tired, emotional and pissed wife to come home to who may have lost some extra support... and a mother in law who thinks I embody everything that's wrong with western culture and parents these days."
"TIFU by dropping off my dog at a kid's summer camp


Technically yesterday and not today, but YIFU sounds like some odd anime genre so...

So it's summer, which means my 6yo daughter goes to summer camp. I was dropping her off at about 8ish and I was also going to drop my dog off at doggie daycare because the gardeners are coming today and they don't appreciate her trying to protect them from those murderous rakes and lawnmowers. For the record, the dog is a 13 year old black lab / pit bull mix.

Anyway, stopped at the summer camp. My daughter grabbed the dog's leash and walked her to the drop off desk to show her to her friends. I signed my daughter in and then I.... just drove off. In my defense, well, I got nothing. Honestly, I just forgot the dog there.

So my wife picks up our daughter in the afternoon and is quite surprised to find the dog there with her. Apparently, the dog (and the kids) had a great day at summer camp. I now have pictures of my dog participating in such activities as ""paint a rock"" (she did not do very well on this one), ""learning about dinosaurs"" (did not participate) and ""digging for fossils"" (which was right in her sweet spot of digging bones out of dirt). She also enjoyed water activities and apparently stole some snacks. She got a free shirt and we got a picture of her wearing the shirt with her camp team wearing identical shirts. All in all, could have gone worse.

TL;DR - Dropped dog off at kiddie summer camp by mistake. Dog had a great time and I think she's now a camp counselor."
"TIFU by sleeping with my landlord


okay so this happened over the weekend and today. 
On Friday, i went to view an apartment. I had talked to the landlord on the phone and was seeing the apartment with the super. 
So i see the apartment, everything’s great, get an application, fill it all out and email it to the landlord. 

I get a call from him a few hours later, just going over details of my application and he offers me the apt. I’m going to go in on monday to sign the lease. 

Okay so now it’s Saturday night and i’m just swiping through tinder and match with a cute guy, mid 30s, (im 20). let’s call him steve
he messaged me, we flirt, he comes over to my place. we have mediocre sex at best, then he leaves to go home. 

So monday rolls around and I go to the apartment building to sign the lease and tie up any loose ends

I walk up the building and steve is standing outside with a woman and i see he has some papers in his hand. 

The woman waves to me and introduces herself as steve’s WIFE. steve looks totally chill, while i’m freaking outside but trying to remain calm. I did not sign up for this. 

Anyway, i feel bad for his wife and i feel like a horrible person even though i had no idea that he was married. 
Can’t wait to live there for a whole year! 

 
TL;DR 
Slept with my landlord without knowing who he was and found out he has a wife."
"TIFU twice by grabbing a new coworkers boob and then forgetting her husband died


Happened an hour ago on lunch, so a real tifu for you guys. On Wednesday’s our department head takes everyone out for a long lunch, it’s a special time we all look forward to in our boring 45 hour work week. It is normal to carpool all together and naturally I drive my two friend-coworkers each time. However this week we have a new hire just out of grad school, we’ll call her Sarah (changed). She’s quickly picking up pace with the rest of the office and settling in nicely. While everyone is leaving the office for lunch I offer her a ride in my car with the other two and she agrees and hops in the passenger seat. Now here’s where the first fuck up happens. While on the way to the restaurant Sarah is picking up on the group dynamic and tagging in on some good banter. Everything is going smooth and then while crossing into an intersection the car in front of us gets swiped by someone who thought they could make the right turn in time. Traffic comes to a halt and I slam on the breakers and in doing so reach out to my right to stop her from flying forward. I check to see we are all good and everyone is okay while realizing I am currently full on honkin Sarah’s right knocker my words start to trail off. “Damn I hope everyone is oka.....” that kind of sentence that time slows down in, yeah. Amazingly she laughs it off and says not to worry about it that I was just reacting to the situation. For the next few minutes the car was silent until Sarah said “that’s funny I haven’t had that much action in a while” which eased the mood and the car all laughed. And fuck up number two comes from my dumb ass saying “ahh well we all have our dry spells.” Something I thought was innocent enough but still playing along with the banter we had going earlier. She goes quiet the rest of the car starts chatting again. We get to lunch and everything seems okay but Sarah is a little off and not as bright or talkative as she was in the morning so I ask what’s up. She told me she was a little uneasy at my comment in the car. I instantly apologized saying I had no reason to talk about her sexuality and her private life and that I was sorry. She said she didn’t care about that and that it was fine it’s just that it reminded her of the anniversary of her husbands death coming up next month. My heart sunk. I had completely forgotten about her husband. I felt so bad I instantly started apologizing for everything in the world I felt horrible. My friend overheard this and just was white in the face, he seemed mortified to even spectate this conversation. Sarah ended up going home early about 15 minutes ago but stopped by my desk to tell me not to worry about anything from lunch. I feel so horrible that I have been sitting here unproductive writing a reddit post to cope with it. Please reddit help me feel a little better.

TLDR: I yanked a widows titty"
"TIFU By telling my best friend I love her when I thought I was going to die


Throwaway because I don't want this to be on my main account:


Obbligatory ""This didn't happen today but happened last week yadda yadda yadda""

Also please forgive my spelling mistakes because I'm in the hospital and writing this on mobile out of boredom of there being not much to do here.

So, last week I was driving casually on the country road close to my house on holiday back home for the summer after my second year of college. I wasn't paying too much attention (I assume some responsibility) and wasn't wearing a seat belt. Yes I'm an idiot I know lesson learned. WEAR YOUR SEAT BELTS KIDS! Anyway, it was just starting to rain and I saw a KID ABOUT TO GO INTO THE ROAD. For the life of me I still don't know why he thought it would he a good idea to go onto a quite highly trafficked country road so casually, but eh life is full of surprises. I was caught completely off guard and swerved into the opposing lane to avoid him, and promptly got hit head on by the car coming towards me.

Now, I was going quite fast and as I said, did not have a seat belt on. Next thing I knew I was out of my car and couldn't feel anything anymore. No pain, no panic, nothing. I just saw blood and felt the biggest adrenaline rush I've ever had in my life. I just laid there, not knowing what to do. I heard voices come towards me but didn't really know what they were saying, and couldn't really respond. I thought I was going to die. There was a lot of blood.

You know how they say your life flashes before your eyes when you're about to die? Well that didn't quite happen but I did start thinking about who I care about and who I love. Here's where I tell you about my best friend. A girl I've been in love with for around two years, I never let her know and never intended too. She was in a happy relationship she's had since her teens and I didn't want to ruin it, and if she's happy I'm happy. There's no point meddling in things bigger than you and some things aren't meant to be. But I thought I was literally dying, and all I could think about was her in those moments. The pain was starting to kick in but I was just thinking about how she'd never know how much I loved her.

I realised my phone was still in my pocket, and with all the force I could muster I took it out. It was intact and it felt like it took ages but the only message I could sent was an ""I love you"" to her. I thought that would be the last message I'd ever send.

I don't remember much after that. Days have been a blur. I've had quite a few operations, AKI due to trauma and a ruptured spleen. But my legs are starting to work again and my face looks like I got in a fight with a lion but it's slowly improving! All I do is sleep and appreciate the fact I'm alive. The other driver and the kid were okay btw.
Anyway, as you can see, I did indeed live and didn't die (so far), but I can't undo that message I sent. I've been in a lot of pain this past week, and haven't had the energy to confront the situation. I told her about the accident, and what happened, and we talked briefly but mainly about my lovely hospital experience. Earlier today she sent me a message telling me we have to talk about that message. I haven't replied yet and I don't want to. I don't know what to do. So far I've been writing this TIFU as procrastination and then after this I plan on taking a long nap. Thank you all for your attention, nap time calls me.



TLDR: Got in a car accident and while I was bleeding out I told my crush best friend I love her. She's in a 10 year relationship and I haven't talked to her about it since and it's destroying me."
"TIFU by sending a picture of the engagement ring to my girlfriend


tl;dr: Accidentally sent my gf the picture of the engagement ring, kept her from opening it, had to come up with a fake surprise to throw off her suspicions.

So this was actually a few months ago. I (24M) had just recently bought an engagement ring to propose to my at the time girlfriend (24F). I was on the phone with a good friend of ours to tell him the news, and wanted to send him the picture of the ring as a way of telling him while talking to him. 

So I put him on speaker phone and clicked into the text thread, attached the picture, and clicked send. Welp, it was immediately after clicking send that I noticed the texts in the thread didn't look right. I looked up at the name at the top of the thread and my heart stopped: It was my gf. ""Shit"" I said over the phone. My friend asked what was wrong, and I told him I'd have to call him back. Tried finding a way to cancel the message to no avail.

As a last ditch effort, I called her, as the message did not yet say ""Delivered"". She answered the phone and I immediately said ""Do you see the message I just sent?"" ""Yeah...it says attachment, why?"" Immediately I blurted ""Dont open it! Just delete the thread. Please."" 

She sounded concerned, and asked ""Is this something I should be worried about? You're kinda scaring me lol"". ""No, no,"" I said, ""I just have a little surprise for you I was trying to show someone and don't want to ruin the surprise."" She relented, but still seemed (naturally) very suspicious. ""Ok, I deleted it. Didn't look at it."" I know your first thought might be that she looked anyway, but I can 100% promise you that girl would never, ever lie to me. The 1 or 2 times I ever tried to tell a little fib to skirt around something (usually just not wanting to get nagged about something) she was highly upset about it and demanded complete honestly between us. It's just not in her to lie, and she's honestly terrible at it (ie: trying to keep anything as a surpise for me she cannot hide it to save her life).

So I had avoided the disaster of her seeing the ring, but now I had her HIGHLY suspicious of me, and needed a way to throw her off the scent. So I immediately went and found a cute little necklace on Etsy I knew she'd like, and bought it and had it shipped to her house. Later that week she got it and texted me, saying I was very sweet and she loved my surprise. Phew. A few weeks later I actually managed to pull off a surprise proposal against all odds, since she had been telling friends for a bit she suspected I was going to propose. Despite all of this, she was completely surprised when her ""girls' day"" with her bff ended with me proporsing at the waterfall near her house, and we came home to a surprise party with our parents and friends to celebrate.

When I told her about what that text really was and how I covered my tracks, she laughed, rolled her eyes, and called me an idiot. She was impressed with how I improvised and threw her off track lol. We're getting married next October :)"
"TIFU by ripping my anus open


The following events transpired yesterday. Spent last night in A&amp;E, on hardly any sleep and some pretty strong painkillers, so apologies for any mistakes here.

Me and my girlfriend are trying to lose weight, and so for the past few months we have been eating super clean. Salads, quinoa, lean meats, etc. (very few carbs). Lost some weight, gained some muscle from working out too. Very happy with our progress.

Because we had been so dsciplined and it was my birthday, we decided to treat ourselves to our previously weekly treat of takeout. A huge pizza, fries, and nachos each (I know, hence why we needed to lose weight), washed down with soda. 

We went to bed feeling very full and happy, if a little guilty.

I awoke a few hours later with intense stomach cramps. I could feel a ball of pizza nacho fries forming in the pit of my stomach and could tell it was not going to be pretty coming out. I waited till morning to go to the bathroom (small apartment, light sleeper gf), and as soon as I sat down on the crapper and pushed, I felt the most intense pain in my anal sphincter. Like it was being pulled apart from every angle. My girlfriend, who I had woken up by screaming, was now banging on the bathroom door thinking I was being murdered.

The worst part was that I couldn't exactly pinch this bad boy off, as the seal had been broken and my 'pincher' was now severely compromised. So I pushed through the pain, and could feel the ripping worsen with each push as this dry, fibrous monster made it's way out of my asshole. After about 25 minutes I had birthed the hellsnake. I only wish I had taken a photo as this thing was a sight to behold.

A painful car journey and 3 hour wait later, the doctor said I had the worst anal fissures he had ever seen. Apparently the turd was so fat and hard it'd literally ripped my asshole open in multiple places.

Sitting is agony, they itch and burn like hell and I can feel a second boulder pushing its way into my lower intestine. 

TLDR; Avoided bad food for months, gorged on pizza and nachos, gave birth to a baby sized turd that ripped my anal cavity open on its way out, resulting in the worst anal fissures my doctor had ever seen."
"TIFU by destroying my brother's smart home


This actually happened a week ago but I just found out about it today.

My brother rents a studio in NYC but he's been out of town for work. I went up to visit some friends and he said it'd be fine if I stayed at his place. When I got there the wall lights worked but for some reason none of the floor lamps did. There were 5 different floor lamps and none of them would turn on. There was also recently a power outage that affected the same area his studio is in so being the bright man that I am I figured that the power coming back must have fried the bulbs. Being a good brother I went out and bought brand new bulbs and threw out the broken ones. 

Today my brother got back and gave me a call asking if I replaced his light bulbs. I told him I did and not to worry about it but his old ones were broken so I replaced them. Turns out they weren't broken, they were just smart bulbs linked to his smart speaker. They were $60 a piece so I effectively threw out $300 of smart bulbs.

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR Brightest bulb in the closet threw out hundreds of dollars in smart bulbs"
"TIFU by asking Siri to play me a song and making her worry about my mental health


I was using a Bluetooth adapter in my car to be safe and not use my phone while driving. I asked Siri to play a song called “make me wanna die” and to my surprise, instead of playing the song she said something along the lines of “ if you’re feeling depressed the suicide hotline can help you, would you like me to call?” I screamed “ NO DO NOT DO THAT” soooo of course she did anyway. I didn’t want to hang up because idk what happens if you hang up on the suicide hotline? So some lady who had much more important stuff to do answered and I low key yelled “IMFINESIRIGOTCONFUSEDIMSOSORRY” based on her reaction it wasn’t he first time it’d happened but I was still totally mortified. 

tldr: I asked Siri to play a song and she called the suicide hotline instead"
"TIFU by poisoning my cat, Parsley


[This guy](https://i.imgur.com/uU57bdj.jpg)
Usually Parsley is a **huge dildo cat**, always wanting food and pats, biting if he doesn't get what he wants sitting on my face, **big dick energy** without the balls.

This morning when I woke up later than usual he was not up in my grill wanting food, weird but okay. He's sleeping curled up on the couch, when I say good morning he looks at me like - __- and gets up. Tries to jump of the couch, stumbles, lands **face first.**

I laugh he gets up and he starts walking weird, not limping just uncoordinated. Usually he's **pretty vocal** too especially when he's hungry but he was **completely quiet**, his sister smacked him and he barely even **reacted**

Now I'm **freaking out**, thinking he has a **blood clot or a brain tumor** or something. I book him in for an urgent appointment at the vet in half an hour.

I keep an eye on him while we wait, at one point he tried to scratch his ear with his back leg and **missed several times.** When he tried to loaf he was sort of **wibbling wobbling.** He didnt seem interested in food until I started feeding his sister Shenanigans but luckily he ate so I was feeling a bit better.

**At this point I'm crying thinking the motherfucker is gonna die on me like a bitch.**

We take him to the vet, he goes into his carrier calmly without incedent which is very unusual. Vet tests his legs, stretching them out and rotating, nothing there. He often gets abscesses from fights but nothing like that. Vet checks his gums and teeth, his gums are a bit pale which is an **indication of onion toxicity which is fatal**. We'd had nachos the night before which has a bean mix with onions. I tell them he might have gotten some from the pan since we didn't clean it up straight away. If the onion toxicity is bad enough he might **need a blood transfusion to save his life.**

He's also slightly overweight and middle aged which makes him **at risk for diabetes** which can cause nerve damage when left untreated. 

He's kept at the hospital for the rest of the day for observation and blood tests. Vet gives me **brochures on possible household toxins** that are harmful to cats. I go home in tears thinking my cat might be **dying** and blaming myself for not cleaning up the **freaking nachos** last night.

I read some of the brochures to calm down. I go through them thinking maybe he got to some lilies in a neighbours backyard or he licked bleach out of toilet. Then there was **the last entry.**

**Marijuana. Oh fucking shit fuck.**

Motherfucker id made some **super strong cannabutter** last night in prep for a Patrick swayze move night this weekend. That pot had a cup of butter and **a quarter ounce of hydro, simmering for 3 hours**. Parsley also **loves butter** and the smell of weed doesn't put him off. 

Parsley has always been **terrified of stoves** though from when he touched it while it was on so he doesn't go near them while they're lit. I'd strained and refrigerated the cannabutter quickly after making it but I'd left the dirty pot in the sink over night. I decide to check it, 

**that bitch is suspiciously clean.**

Parsley isnt fucking **dying** he's just high as a **god damn kite.**

I have to call the vet and tell them my suspicions. His blood test came back negative for anything scary and he'd had **6 serves of chicken** while at the vet and **napped** almost all day, played with some dogs and snuggled with some kittens. Motherfucker had a **great time. **


**TLDR I made dank cannabutter, left out the dirty pot in the sink overnight, stupid cat licked it clean and had a real good time on my dime. I should charge him for it. **"
"TIFU by trying to teach my daughters about savings, now I may need a chocolate coins bailout


Well, not exactly today. This started back in June, but it's only just now that I realize how deep I am and the evil little muggle I have created.

I'm a single dad from México. And every opportunity I get to teach my daughters (5 and 3) something I try to take it. And it works amazing if you put a fun little twist into it, which usually means sugar or pepperoni pizza.

Now, my daughters get an allowance from me. It's a small amount, enough to get a little something from the school's cafeteria (Privately owned) and then some to ""save"", which they never do of course. One night I was doing some shopping since they were staying with me for the whole month of June, and being the awesome dad that I am I needed to get the cutest Unicorn pajamas I could find, marshmallows and whatever bag that contained the word ""Candy"" on it in the whole store. That's when I saw Chocolate Coins, you know [This ones](https://i.imgur.com/gvflT3T.png). So I immediately thought I could turn this into a learning experience while at the same time being their hero for giving them chocolate.

Here's my thought. I'll give each of them 5 chocolate coins every Monday. They can either eat them or save them as they wish. But whatever amount of coins they had remaining by Monday morning I'd take as ""savings"" and I'd give them their 5 new ones for the week plus 50% of the total amount as a bonus. So if one of them had 2 coins remaining then she'd get 5 more on Monday morning, making it 7, I'd take that and add 50% more (3.5, rounds up to 4) so that girl would then have 2 + 5 + 4 = 11 coins. By just saving 2! But they wouldn't get any bonus if they saved just 1 or none. Here's where people who are good at math are starting to get where this is going... But it's even worse.

The little one ate all of her coins that very first Monday. I don't think she even took the wrapper off. The big one lasted until Friday. Weekends are rough man, you need your chocolate coins to relax. Next Monday I give them their 5 coins but this time they only got to eat 2 maximum a day (I needed to step in with some regulations, sue me!). By Tuesday my parents come visit and the kids want to go with them and spend the night, so of course I said yes and off they went, leaving their coins behind. One night turned into 5 actually, and they came back on Sunday to their 4 and 3 coins each.

""Thank God my parents helped me or this would've never even work"", I thought. They'll finally reap some rewards and maybe learn the lesson here. The big one eats only 1 coin and keeps 3. The little one eats her maximum amount allowed, of course, and keeps 1. Next morning they get a big surprise.

Big one gets 5 coins, saved 2, gets 4 as a bonus, so ends up with 11.

Little one gets her 5 coins, saved 1, no bonus. Ends up with 6.

I then saw it. My older daughter's eyes turned into black and I swear I could see sweatshops filled with 5 year olds working for her while she laughs maniacally. She's up to something, I just know! And boy was I right.

That Monday they started a bit of summer school. They get to see their classmates for 2 hours a day and do some random activity, the big one brings her coins for some reason, and at some point I swear I saw her smirk at me on the mirror, as if she was warning me I'd get staved 20 times from behind with a plastic retractile knife to cut fake vegetables with.

We get there, dropped them off and left to do some shopping. When I came back for them I noticed my daughter's coin bag was empty (Remember, 2 a day max) so I asked her what happened. She smiles and says ""I sold them"", ""What do you mean you sold them?"", ""Yup, they gave me real coins for them"". I was proud. I have an entrepreneur! (Or the reincarnation of Genghis Khan, not sure yet). I asked how much she got and it comes out exactly at $44 pesos, $4 for every coin. Which is about $2.2 US dollars. She actually made a profit. I buy the coins bags at the candy shop and they cost me almost exactly $1 peso per coin, she got $4 each!. Here's where it all goes down hill.

We get home and she asks if we can go to the store. Little convenience store owned by the neighborhood's grandpa. I agree and we go. She gives the old man her whole $44 pesos and asks for nothing but chocolate coins. Grandpa has to make a profit off the damn things of course, so he sells them at $2 pesos each. That means my daughter sold 11 coins and with that money she's getting 22, double the amount! I just hope she doesn't find out I outsource my product or I'll be in trouble.

I'm so proud of her, she's making a profit and she's even outsmarting me. By Friday she has already sold 96 coins, all the while eating her 2 coins a day and even keeping some money since she's only investing on 20 coins a day at grandpa's store (Parents noticed and some didn't like the little shits buying 400% price inflated chocolate from her, but she kept some regulars).

Yesterday was a Monday. My daughter had 274 coins. I gave her 5. And 50% of that total was 140 more. She has 419 now. She doesn't even need to buy coins anymore, I'm her provider and I'm doing it for free... I need a bailout.

TL;DR - I thought about teaching my daughters the importance of savings, but I instead learned some people will take advantage of everybody, and some are just happy eating some chocolate."
"TIFU By forcing a single mother to pay for both our meals


So, first time posting here, still 10 shades of red from the embarrassment. So, I decided on my payday to treat myself to a breakfast at the international house of pancakes. I get seated and enjoy my Dr pepper waiting for my meal when I see a woman across the restaurant sitting with her two small children, about 3 and 4. 

Nothing out of the ordinary, except I see that the two children are sharing a pancake and a water, and thought about my mom being single and struggling, so I decided to do something good for a change. When my waitress came by I asked if I could get my check and the woman's as well, and to tell her to order whatever she wanted. The waitress looked pleasantly surprised and informed the mother that someone offered to pay for her meal and to order whatever she wanted, so she got both the kids some pancakes in the shape of a smiley face and a stack of pancakes for herself and orange juices all around. The waitress informed the mother that I paid for the meal, (it should be noted that there were three tables being sat, and we were the ones ones in that side of the restaurant,) and she smiled and waved at me. I nodded as I finally achieved enough good karma to clear my conscious and headed for the register. 

Here's where the FU happens:
The manager checked me out and told me that paying for her meal was so nice of me to do, and I batted the compliment away just enough to be humble but stroke my ego. As she tells me the balance, I pull out my wallet and hand her my AutoZone rewards card. She stares at me blankly and when I look down,

 I AM MORTIFIED.

That is where I leave my debit card, and that's when it hits me that I bought something at Kinokuniya the day before and wrapped my receipt around my card, then threw the bag and receipt in the trash.

Now, I do have Google pay, so I figured I could pay with that since most places that take Apple pay take Google pay as well, however, they said that their location is cash only, the reason for that will never be known to me. The manager is SUPER understanding, but says something about ""things happening for a reason,"" and straight up that she can't allow me to leave without paying. I realize now that created a situation in which I've allowed a woman to order food for what she thinks is free, only for it to turn out that some a-hole left her with the bill. I have no choice but to ask the only other customer if I could have him pay for both our meals and I could follow him to the bank. 

The look on this man's face was so condescending and confused that as soon as I asked, I apologized and walked away. 

Now, with NO OTHER OPTIONS, I have to do the hands down MOST EMBARRASSING AND CRINGIEST in my life. At this point I don't know of the mother has caught wind of what is going on, but when I approached her, she told me how appreciative she was, that she had just been laid off and just wanted to let her kids eat something before she takes them to the welfare office for the rest of the day to try to get on food stamps. At this point she had tears in her eyes and I did as well, thinking of my own mother, and how little things like a pancake with a whipped cream smiley face made my whole week, and how my mother did her very best to try to allow us to have a normal childhood, and I am forever grateful to her for that. However, the whole time I'm thinking how to break it to her, and as I'm about to tell her the situation, she tells her kids to thank me, and they do, with whipped cream all over their faces, smiling and laughing, and at this point I feel as though I'm in impractical Jokers or some type of prank show. 

I had no idea how to break it to her, so I said:

""You're so welcome, but.... I actually... Kinda... Lost my debit card. I have the money in my bank account, if you have something like cash app or venmo, I could pay you. Would it.be possible to pay... for both of us?""  

I don't believe in God, but in that moment I wanted him to smite my ass and send me straight to hell.

Her face turned blank, with such a sad look on her face, as to say, "" PLEASE you can't be serious?"" I realized by her face that she didn't have the money, and we both kinda glanced at her kids who didn't have a care in the world as to what happens now.

At this point I have no idea what I'm going to do, everyone I know is at work, I'm not and my usual area, and I feel super bad for putting this lady in this position against her will. Luckily, the turning point of the story is that she said that her brother works about 10 minutes away, and he has a card and can come pay the bill. I apologised profusely, and was only trying to make her day a little better, she was also very understanding and grateful. The brother came by to pay the bill, I paid him back and then some, after it was all said and done we had a little bit of a laugh about it, and we parted ways.

TLDR; I offered to pay for a mom and her children's meal, and to order more food only to discover I lost my debit card and asked her to pay for both of our meals

"TIFU by using EasyJet


Hello Reddit!!! This is my first TIFU, and it's because I chose to fly EasyJet, even after a bunch of people told me to avoid it! I hope you all enjoy this story so here it begins.

My wife and I decided to take a trip to Amsterdam from the states this summer to visit family. During said trip we booked a seperate flight to London for 3 days. The 22nd-24th.  We arrived in Amsterdam on the 21st and left the next day, all went smooth. We enjoyed the city of London and visited pretty much all of it in the time we had. Then the chaos began.

On the 24th while at Gatwick Airport our flight to Amsterdam was canceled due to a fueling issue in Amsterdam, this was understandable as our flight home from Amsterdam was on the 28th, so no big deal; we'd catch another flight. My wife had purchased alcohol after security and was told by a manager we could get a free checked bag. After being online at customer service for 3 hours the airline said the next flight was on the 26th and they had booked us for 2 nights at a hotel. When we arrived at the hotel they said we were booked for only 1 night and dinner was no longer being served.

On the 25th we went back to the airport to request another hotel since they had mistakingly booked just a night, and we had to wait another 5 hours on line. They eventually booked us a night at a different hotel. When we arrived at the hotel they told us nothing was booked, and to go back to EasyJet. We went back and had to wait another 3 hours, totalling 8. They apologized and said the confirmation was never sent. So a whole day of opportunity wasted. We got back to the hotel and missed our food vouchers, again.

On the 26th we got to the airport and our flights were canceled again, due to weather issues. However employees told us it was due to a crew issue and other airlines were flying to Amsterdam without a problem. We had to stay on line again for 4 hours, only for them to tell us there were no available flights for a few days. We needed to be back in Amsterdam by the 28th. They hired a taxi, and drove us to Luton airport 2 hours away on the 27th. Another whole day wasted. 

On the 27th when we arrived at Luton Airport we asked about our free checked bag we were promised on the 24th, and an employee told us ""I don't care what a random person or employee told you, it's not happening"". I tried to explain how we have had multiple canceled flights and the employee said ""I'm going to walk away now.""I started to get upset.. my wife made me walk away. We decided it wasn't worth our fight. Another hour at customer service. When we got to our hotel we were told we had no food accommodations and had to argue there for an hour, which then they only allowed us pizza for dinner. Whatever, it was food! Yet again, another day wasted. 

On the 28th our 7 am flight was canceled again due to a crew issue.. It was unbelievable. We had only gotten 4 hours of sleep. In response they put us on the 8 am flight. We ran to security, got to the gate and got loaded into a bus. After 20 minutes waiting to be driven to the plane our flight got canceled.. For the fourth time; and they announced it was a crew issue. We would now miss our flight home. When we got back into the airport the attendant told us to wait in an area to recieve further information. They had then come to us and told us they don't know where our checked bags went and may be lost and could take a few hours to have them returned. I was livid! This whole trip had become a comic book! We got our bags an hour later. We waited on customer service for another 3 hours and they told us we had to go 2 hours back to Gatwick Airport to catch a flight home and they would pay for our flight to the states. We called Norwegian, who we missed, and to reschedule our flights cost us 900 pounds, which we are hoping EasyJet will refund (they said they would, and wrote a notice in our account.. But who knows, my trust is gone). They drove us back to Gatwick and we stayed the night. 

So now today, on the 29th, we were told we had no check in bags on our account. We explained our insane situation and they still were hesitant to check a bag for us at no cost. Eventually after a long period of time they did. Now we await in the airport for our 5th flight to Amsterdam.. And hopefully then home. I won't ever choose this airline again. 

I understand the first cancelation, the second, third and fourth not at all. The people we dealt with were mostly aggressive, stressful, and non-caring. We totalled 19 hours dealing with customer service, we were told different things by different employees, failures in bookings, missed accommodations, etc. 

TL;DR - Stuck in England from the 24th-29th, 4 canceled flights at 2 different airports with EasyJet. Driven to another airport a then back to the original airport. Three cancelations likely from crew issues. Miss managed accommodations, rude and aggressive employees, rescheduling our flights home, lost baggage... What a trip!"
"TIFU by hurting my kitten


This morning I was awoken by my kitten pouncing on the bed. He does this almost every morning. I’ve come to understand that this means he’s hungry. Before I get up I usually give him some belly rubs. Well today when he jumped onto my bed, I had only gotten 4ish hours of sleep and was half asleep when I gave him his belly rubs. As I was letting him I felt a lump, it was something raised on his skin. So, me being dumb, I felt it for a few second, thought “maybe it’s a tic” and went to pull to see if it would give. Welp, that was met by a sharp bite to my wrist and a few scratches on the back of my hand. I accidentally tugged on my kitten’s Johnson.  As soon as I realized what had happened I jumped up to see if he was okay. He ran under my bed and hid from me for a good 2 hours. He finally came out for some treats. I think he’s still mad at me.

TL;DR: Was half asleep and yanked my kitten’s pp. He hates me now"
"TIFU by accidentally revealing to my wife that I had slept with her sister.


So this happened a last night. She uses Reddit so I hope she doesn't read this. Thank god we dont share accounts. No I did not cheat on her with her sister. Allow me to explain.

I had met my wife some 6 years ago through a mutual friend. After a about few months of dating, we decided we wanted to move in together. She was 20 and I was 22. At this point I had not yet met her family nor has she met mine. I guess once her parents got wind of our big plans, they decided to have a celebratory dinner to meet the ""poor sucker"" as her father described me..  she and her sister lived with their parents. We got there just in time, dinner had just come out of the oven. All seated at the table, her sister comes upstairs and me and her immediately lock eyes. Was a very awkward 2 hours. Her sister pulled me aside when she got a chance and we both vowed to never speak about the one night stand. 

Fast forward to today, my wife decides to ask me funny questions she read online.  Her question was  ""where is the wierdest place you have ever had sex. We have an understanding that we both had sex lives before we met so I thought I would blow her mind with this one. 

well.
I proceed to tell her  about  the craziest place I ever had sex. I told her how our mutual friend ( same on who had introduced us)  had  a massive party. His property was huge and had a semi repurposed barn in the back. Me and some girl found a nicely secluded area of the barn and went at it like a bunch of barn animals. We were fucking vigorously that we broke some old rocking chair we were ""repurposing"" ourselves. As I'm sitting there laughing away, I notice she is not laughing. As a matter of fact she looked disgusted and shocked. Like she was about to burst into tears. I realized something was wrong.

Turns out she had asked her sister that question early. And her sister provided the same choice of craziest places right down to the broken chair and the month of the year.  I completely forgot that THAT was where I banged her sister.. well we had some unsettling words. I tried to convince her it was just a coincidence. She spoke to her sister but I dont know what was said. She hasn't spoken to me since. I slept on the guest room and she was gone for work early by the time I got up. Her sister wont answer my calls. Guess I'll find out after work what the situation will be.  

TL;DR :  I accidentally told my wife I banged her sister 6 years ago before we met and now i dont know if our relationship is over or not"
