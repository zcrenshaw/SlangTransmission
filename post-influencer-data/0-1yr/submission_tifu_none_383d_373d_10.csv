"TIFU by microwaving a chef boyardee on an active military base


As with most things this happened last week. I'm currently deployed in the middle east. We got off work a little later than expected and missed the galley hours so we stopped at the mini mart on base to grab some food. They have a decent selection mostly just your typical gas station food. So some guys grab cold sandwiches or microwavable burritos, I decided to go for the chef boyardee classic spaghetti and meatballs. Now you have to heat you food at the mini mart because they don't trust us with microwaves in our rooms. You'll understand why soon enough. I put my spaghetti in the microwave and set the timer.  We are just bullshiting in the mini waiting for our food when all of a sudden a loud bang what sounded like a gunshot goes off behind us and without skipping a beat there were 4 marines M16s raised yelling at everybody to get down as they make their way through the shop clearing the isles straight towards us. That's when I realized I forgot to remove the metal top from the spaghetti. I had to show them the inside of the microwave now covered in spaghetti sauce and meatballs before they finally relaxed and put their guns down. I ended cleaning the microwave and buying a second chef boyardee.





TL;DR I microwaved a chef boyardee with the metal top on creating a small spaghetti bomb surrounded by a bunch of trigger happy marines Creating a really world close quarters drill."
"TIFU by knocking up a girl on the first night, but wait


 Title says it all. I met her through Tinder, the condom broke but she said not to worry because she's on the pill. Fast forward a week, where I see her for the second time, and she tells me that she's pregnant. Boring story, I know. Now for the fun part. I saw self harm scars on her arm, but only on the second night (she insisted on having the lights off on the first night. She then proceeded to tell me that those were from her two previous abortions, where she was so tortured about it that she had to do this. And that now she probably couldn't handle a third abortion and that anyways she actually knows how to kill herself this time. My heart fucking sank, man. She's now coming over and will be here in an hour, so that we could continue talking. We barely slept because we were talking about it and she says she's 70% sure she wants to keep the baby, but that she wouldn't ask any help from me, except seeing the baby once in a while. I can barely believe what I'm typing right now. I bought two early pregnancy tests, the expensive kind. I don't know what to do. Any advice? 

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR I knocked up a girl on the first night seeing her, the crazy came out on the second night a week later with the news, and she's 70% sure she wants to keep it. Send help."
"TIFU (UPDATE) By knocking up a girl on the first night, but wait (there's more!)


[First post here](https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/9b5c3x/tifu_by_knocking_up_a_girl_on_the_first_night_but/)

Update time. I booked an appointment to get myself checked. I have started to look for legal advice, and I'll probably make a post in r/legaladvicecanada tomorrow.

OK, things I left out of the first post, mainly due to the general confusion of the situation and trying to recall all the stuff that happened;

\- She refused to take the home early pregnancy detection test, citing disrespect on my part (I was respectfully but firmly challenging the timeline).

\- When I asked her when was the start of her last menstrual cycle, she immediately said July 27th (I met her for the first time on August 21st).

\- She made threats. ''You should get slapped'' ''I can send some people''. I asked her if those were actual threats, she said yeah. Later, I asked her if she knew that making these kind of threats is an actual crime, she asked nervously if I had recorded it. I should have, was too nervous to think about it beforehand.

\- I did ask her to see some form of proof of pregnancy.

\- She has said earlier that she had a home abortion with a pill. I include this fact because she sent me [this](https://imgur.com/a/qA4bSmS). She has not yet answered with a picture of the dates, which makes me think this bottle might be from the previous abortion.

&amp;#x200B;

So to recap, even though she's obviously a manipulator, I think some things she said were true, like her two previous abortions and somehow, because of the swiftness of her answer, the start of her last menstrual cycle. Now, my train of thought is that if she was trying to frame me as the father, she would have planned a logical timeline that fit with our first encounter. Her starting a (assuming a somewhat regular) cycle on July 27th would approximately make her fertile from August 10th to the 14th. So a week or more before we met.

Thoughts?

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR I might not be completely cleared yet, but logic seems to be on my side. I think."
"TIFU by throwing out 18 pounds of meat in the Texas sun.


Hello!

Last Wednesday I cleared out the freezer. My shitty ex-roommates had left 18 pounds of cheap meat in there, and I was so preoccupied by my thoughts of “who the fuck even does that” that it wasn’t until after it was all in the bottom of the can that it occurred to me that the trash had just come the day before. 

Hm. Well, the lid will be closed. It’ll be fine. Right?

On Friday, I exited the house and was greeted by several dozen flies. Ah. I’ve fucked up. This is immediately apparent to me. Well, it’ll just have to wait until trash day.

Saturday. I need to take the kitchen trash out. I leave it outside, figuring that I can just wait until after the can has been cleared. 

Sunday. Raccoons have been in my bagged garbage. I need to take care of that. Hesitantly, I open the can lid. Oooooooh boy. In a split second, I get the immediate impression that there are hundreds of maggots in the can. I’m short—just barely 5’3”, So this was based entirely on the ones I could see far up the sides of the can. But I’m fairly tough, I think. I’ve pulled maggots out of a baby skunk’s leg wound before. And I’m  a budding baby biologist. I can handle this. So I throw the bag into the can.

I am now sure there are at least 1000 maggots in the can. 

Monday. Otherwise known as today. I gear up. Poison, rubber gloves, eye protecting glasses, a face mask, and a box of moth balls. I can do this. I’m a scientist. I throw open the lid. It had not occurred to me that they might be on the underside of the lid.

There were at LEAST a thousand maggots JUST on the underside of the lid. These rained down everywhere, their hideous bodies plopping onto the ground. I thank my lucky stars none got on me. I screamed like I was being murdered, an entirely involuntary sound wrenched from somewhere deep in my spine. I sprayed. And I sprayed, and I sprayed. I walked around and sprayed the writhing layer of maggots on the underside of the lid. I sprayed at the ground. A fly flew at my face and I gave up, running back inside, sobbing. 

For a while, I watched from my back window as they crawled around on the can and the ground. I called my mom, who laughed at me. I called my dad, who was seven hours away and couldn’t help. I called my boyfriend, who was five hours away and without a car. I’m here for school; I have friends, but none good enough to help me with something like this.

And it’s Labor Day. I called eight different pest control places until I found one that was both open and able to send someone out. I’m currently awaiting my savior, who should be here in a few hours. I’ll update with the cost of him coming out. 

TL;DR: grew maggots in 100° weather for a week, made it rain when I tried to take care of it. Now scarred for life. 

On the bright side, I now know for a fact that as much as I enjoy learning about bees and ants, I should not apply to that entomology master’s degree program I was looking at. "
"TIFU by letting ants eat my semen


This happened a few hours ago. Alternate account because, well... you'll see.

So it's been getting pretty hot on occasion here in Southern California. As a result, ants have been coming inside a lot more frequently to stay cool. Leave a single crumb unattended and there will be a huge swarm when you return. We've had quite a few massive invasions recently.

My school, a local community college, was off today. When parents left for the day at about noon, I decided to relieve some of the back to school stress with a good old fashioned wank session.

So the fuck-up. After blowing my load in mere seconds (you know, because stress), I made the mistake of carelessly disposing of my fapkins in the bedside wastebasket. Just temporary, I thought. I would do away with my seed more thoroughly after my post-nut shower. Of course, I didn't remember to do that, and after my shower I continued going about my lovely day off.

When I came home in the evening I was pretty tired and I was right about to slip into bed when I noticed **HUNDREDS  OF THOUSANDS** of ants clustering over my bed. I quickly realized where they were focused; the bedside trash can with my semen-laced fapkins still inside. They were using my bed as a sort of bridge to get from my cracked open window to get to the wastebasket and eat my jizz.

I discreetly threw away my fapkins as I should've done several hours earlier and began the process of ridding my house of the ants. My mom took note of the commotion and entered my room, but I was able to (rather cleverly) convince her that I had merely left a granola bar wrapper in the trash. 

There ended up being too many ants in my bed for me to sleep so I have relocated to the couch for tonight. Lesson learned; dispose of your penis grigio swiftly and efficiently.

TL;DR: Beat off, carelessly left my fapkins in my bedside wastebasket all day in my ant-infested house, came home to an army of ants swarming my bed just to eat my semen."
"TIFU by frying my Retina perminantly


You're probably wondering how a person could fry his or her retina. Staring at the sun? Flaming your eye with a lighter?(lol) Well, there's a more hazardous way that I unfortunately got involved in a few days back and I learned today that it's consequences were perminant.


As a curious teen, I loved playing around with extreme stuff such as high voltage capacitors that generate enormous sparks, neodymium magnets or even high powered lasers which shouldn't even be legal. I did fuck up with almost everything at least once but the lasers are the ones that left a perminant scar on my life. *Warning: don't get inspired by my experiences and never think of buying a high powered laser unless you truly are up for the risk*


One day, i unboxed a 3000 MilliWatt laser that i ordered online and was quite excited to use it. It was huge and solid built with a rechargeable heavy battery. I didn't want to go outside since pointing it upwards could cause disturbance in air traffic i.e: planes. And pointing it down could start a fire within seconds. The laser was so powerful that even staring at the projected dot could cause eye damage. I was stupid enough not to buy laser safety glasses because i never took precautions when doing anything. So after charging it to 100 percent i started pointing it to places like the wall, the ceiling, pretty normal stuff. I even burnt some wood and plastic for fun because why not? I took it out on a rainy day once and pointed it to my house wall from a distance around 20 meteres and it was awesome. The beam was extremely bright and looked phenomenal in the dark. 


So after a couple of hours goofing around with it, i wanted to point it near my eye from a distance to visualise the ""light saber effect""[like it wasn't bright enough already from the sides]. I placed it an arms length from my eye and stared almost directly at it. It was an unreal experience, it looked like a bright blue neon stick! I kept staring for a minute and got nervous for some reason, probably from the risk i was taking and my bottom and back had strange goosebumps that caused me to slightly move towards the death beam which was centimetres away from my left eye. I panicked and quickly tried to get up. As i forced myself up, my back tilted slightly towards the beam, it was enough to expose my whole pupil directly at it. I screamed and closed my eye instantly due to the reflex and held both my hands on it. The exposure musy have been a fraction of a second long but it literally burned my retina instantly. I told myself it wasn't a big deal and kept my eye closed for a like 10 minutes. It was burning so i took some ice and held it on the area to cool it down. When i opened my eye, there was a black/grey area i can't really describe that couldn't see color. It covers the area around my focal point (wherever i stare at). I didn't worry much since i thought it'd heal and my light sensing cells would regenerate. I was dead wrong on that. Little did i know the color sensing cells never regenerate nor heal properly, so the damage was and is perminant. I did go ti the doctor and he said the color sensing cells (rods and cones) will unfortunately never recover but scar tissue will substitute them. The ""scar tissue"" can't sense shit, it's just there to prevent more damage.



The fortunate thing i learned by experience is that our brain is an intelligent piece of meat. Although my eye has a huge blind spot near the focal point, as time passes, it's appearance is becoming more subtle and less noticeable. Basically our brain finds a way to keep us functioning normal even if we aren't. We all have a blind spot on both of our eyes. You don't notice it because the brain fills it with the surrounding colors and patterns. This is why i don't notice it much. You can find out how it functions in [this vsauce video](https://youtu.be/4I5Q3UXkGd0).


I do regret playing around with it so ordered laser safety glasses and am gonna take precautions whenever performing such dangerous experiments. Never point lasers (including those 5 milliwatt ones) to the eye even from far off. 


TL;DR: burnt my retina with a high power laser and now my left eye has a huge blind spot on it. I didn't expect the worst when experimenting with the high power diode but now i learned my lesson, don't try this kids, it ain't what you expect it to be. "
"TIFU by posting on Reddit


I’ve long wanted to tell this story because Reddit is part of the story and to that end it is something of a cautionary tale, but until I retire from this industry, this could still come back to bite me. So in order to tell it, I have to be vague (the full details are really, annoyingly juicy) and use a throwaway for, as you will find out, some people are very good at scouring through Reddit comments...  
    
Back in 2014 I was working for a big company, where I had been for just shy of 12 years. My job was on the way out because of automation but I was fine with this, it was time to move on. My company, however, were treating me and my team like pieces of shit, and as the team manager, I wasn’t letting them get away with fucking my guys about. This made me unpopular with senior management. 

One day I was called into a room and told my job was being changed dramatically. I argued that they were trying to avoid paying me my severance as stipulated in my contract (would've been about $60k) by making me so bored I’d quit. I demanded to see a new job description so I knew for sure what they expected me to do in my 40 hour week (my job was now taking 3-4 hours a week to do) and made it clear I was considering legal action (another mistake, I soon realized). 

I was sitting pretty, I felt. I was keeping my nose clean and waiting for the severance offer. I even called a meeting with my team to warn them that the company would do anything to get rid of us long-termers on the cheap.  Don't give them an excuse, I said. Little did I know, I already had... 
  
Because I was so bored all the time I was spending more and more time on Reddit. On one occasion, about two months before this kicked off, I came across a big discussion about a product that I knew a fair bit about. So I joined the conversation, defending the product and explaining that, based on some meetings I’d attended with this company, the product is going to be way better than these guys realize by the time it gets released to the public. 
    
So a few days after the initial job-change meeting, I get invited to another meeting, and on this occasion my manager pulls out some print outs featuring comments from my Reddit account. It turned out that the company who were developing the product regularly searched Reddit for stuff about them, had seen what I’d said, gone through five years worth of comments and figured out where I worked. They then compared it to their NDA lists and identified me as the likely culprit. They said I was under NDA and shouldn’t be commenting on any of their products on social media. Which, frankly, was entirely fair of them. 
  
Normally, this wouldn’t have been a huge deal. My old managers would have slapped me about and then told senior management it was taken care of. But those guys were long gone, and the management I now answered to really didn't like me or my team, and wanted to save $200k a year by getting rid of us. 
  
The Reddit comment was positive and didn’t reveal any secrets, so this company were keen for me to delete it and leave it at that, but my employer saw an opportunity to avoid paying my severance, and launched a full investigation - but they sucked at investigating, and were unable to conclusively prove I’d written any comments at all (they didn’t even ask to see my company laptop). 
  
But they tried. They found all sorts of comments from several accounts that they tried to attribute to me, but none of it stuck (and most of them had nothing to do with me, the guy investigating really didn't understand Reddit at all). The investigation lasted for nearly three months (on full pay) and my lawyer eventually advised me to sue. So the company had to offer me a settlement or face the whole thing going to court. 
  
I wanted to go through with the legal action as we all knew it was a witch hunt by now, but I was acutely aware that if they found evidence that I used that Reddit account, I would be on shaky ground. Friends and family convinced me to take the offer, so I accepted it and moved on with life, albeit about $20k down overall. 
  
TL:DR - I fucked up by posting about work on Reddit, my employer used it to try and fire me, I lost out on severance package, recovered some of it by threatening to sue. "
"TIFU by pretending to hunt a burglar with a Japanese kitchen knife


Mandatory this happened a few weeks ago. 

I was alone at my dad's in the evening and he'd just gotten these fancy new, very very sharp Japanese knives. He specifically told me not to touch them because they were sharp. I think I may be selectively deaf.

At around 11pm I decided to go upstairs and watch some YouTube videos in bed. But I suddenly heard a sound from upstairs. My brain went into full fight-mode, as in ANY SOUNDS AND MOVEMENT WILL BE TREATED AS DANGER. My imagination completely took over and I grabbed the largest fucking Japanese knife I could find. 

I was the definition of stealth. I was danger. That burglar would never see me coming. I tip-toed up the stairs, holding the knive in an upwards position. My brain was convinced the burglar was in the bathroom (because where else would he be?) so I repositioned the knife for attack-mode. 

Well, that was a mistake. You know, apparently those Japanese knives are not meant to be lightly thrown in the air and then caught like a spear. I dropped the knife after feeling it slide through my flesh like butter and searched for the lights, subsequently running into the doorframe. I cleaned up the blood in my bubble of shame. I was definitely the worst ninja ever.

I now have a scar on my palm of which I will never tell the story to anyone I know. I am 21 years old. I have now retired from nightly knife-wielding.

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR I have a vivid imagination and thought there was a burglar in my bathroom. I am very stupid. I should not touch knives."
"TIFU by using a fleshlight


Throw away account.

This happened a weeks ago. I was always curious to try the fleshlight to see how the experience was. One day I went to the shop near my house and bought one. Since I didn't have much idea about the fleshlights, I didn't buy the lubricant with it. I only realized that I needed it once I got back. Since I was in a horny mood and wanted to try out the fleshlight, I decided to give a go at it without the lubricant. Being a really intelligent guy I deduced that I could use water in place of lubricant. So I closed the blinds in my room, turned on my laptop and put on some porn. I put the fleshlight in between the blankets so that I could thrust. I started to get down with it. While I was thrusting, I did notice some kind of friction on my  penis head. But as I mentioned earlier, being horny, I ignored it and kept on going. When I realized I was about to finish, I decided to finish it with one final thrust, and I did finish with a final thrust, only to experience unimaginable pain coming from my penis. It felt as if ""something"" broke. I took my penis out of my fleshlight only to find it covered in blood. I freaked out when I saw blood coming from my penis. I rushed to the bathroom and cleaned it. The bleeding stopped immediately.  For a minute or two I didn't know what to do. After a while I had the courage to re-examine my penis properly. Thanks to the biology lessons I took while I was in highschool, I realized that I had torn my frenulum. (for guys, it is that small part that connects the foreskin to the penis glans ). After a bit googling and reading through forums I realized that it heals naturally given adequate time.  Currently waiting for it to heal properly.

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR Used a fleshlight without lubricant, ended up tearing my frenulum."
