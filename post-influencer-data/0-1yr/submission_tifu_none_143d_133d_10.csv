"TIFU by reporting a pervert to the School my sons go to.


Over the course of the last week twin 7 year old sons started telling me about a creepy man who sat it the parking lot at school and stared at them.  This morning, I finally took the initiative and called the school.  They assured me that the situation would be handled.

Now, here's how stupid I apparently am: I've been doing electrical repairs on a facility near my sons' school, and each day I park my work van in the school parking lot to eat lunch and use the WiFi.  I wave to my sons as they go from one building to the building housing the cafeteria for lunch.  

If you're realizing that I'm the ""pervert"" I reported, congratulations, you're officially sharper than me.

I didn't realize it until 3 police cars surrounded my work van.

As it turns out, between the work van they'd never seen me in, my hardhat, and my sunglasses, the boys never realized it was me.

After about a 30 minute conversation with the police and the principal, they decided I was a harmless moron and decided to let me go.  I was, however, asked not to park my van there for lunch anymore.

TL/DR: Called school over ""pervert"" watching my sons, turns out it was me the whole time. Was nearly arrested."
"TIFU by submitting hardcore furry erotica instead of my final paper.


 So, i'm currently a 4th year computer science student at a pretty respected university and was looking to graduate this semester. One of the classes I was taking was a class in modern advancements and trends in the field of technology. While the class didn't require to much heavy lifting it still was a higher level one and required a good amount of work. For our final, our professor had assigned us a 20-page research paper into a current or possible future technology of our choice whiten the field. I did my paper on helium-3 power generation. I worked my ass off on this paper and in the end was super proud of it. The papers were due last night at midnight and I held off on submitting my final draft till the end to get it as clean ass possible. This is where I fucked up big time.   

  
  Let me tell you a little about myself. I don't work a normal job. I tried it in my first year of school and I really didn't like it. I've worked internships when they came up but outside of that I really didn't “work”. This and being a student really doesn't mix well though. So, I had to make money some way. For the past 3 years i've gotten by on writing hardcore erotica on commission. Specifically, for furries. I would write anything. Any fetish, any premise, anything. In some parts of that community I became really popular. At one point I was making almost 2500$ on patron along with the amounts I charged  to my customers. Am I proud of this? No. I have written some really disgusting stuff; but it paid the bills and the money was too good to pass up. I told myself the minute I got a “real” job I was cutting and running from this work. 

    
  Well, this brings us to last night. I had not gotten any sleep for the past few nights. I had multiple projects due that in the span of a few days. I was running on nothing but coffee and rockstar. I was nothing more than a walking corpse and wanted to do nothing but sleep. I ended up doing my last read over of my final paper and submitted it before sleeping. However, instead of submitting my final paper, I somehow submitted one of the commissions I was working on. This commission is not light either. It is almost 10 pages long and contains a variety of things including vore and scat.   

  
  So, I went to bed. Submissions for the final locked and my academic career was sentenced to death then and there. When I woke up this morning I checked my grades for my other classes before noticing an email from my professor, all it says was to come to his office after class today.  

   
  I want to fucking die right now. I don't know how I'm going to explain why instead of my final I submitted a hard core erotic story with a wold man jacking off in a dragons stomach. But yeah, I fucked up big time.   

  
  Tl:Dr: In my final semester at college. Instead of submitting my final research paper, I submitted hardcore furry erotica someone paid me to make. Professor “want's to talk” and I want to die."
"TIFU by matching with my homophobic uncle on Grindr


So I have an uncle (we will call him J) who has always been VERY vocal about his disapproval of my sexuality. There is not a family gathering that goes by where he doesn't say something assholish about homosexuality or me specifically.

Well this weekend in between family gatherings I was looking to meet somebody . I started chatting with an older man because that's how I roll. A lot of older guys don't like to show their faces because they aren't out so I don't think much of it when he doesn't show me his face. We actually hit it off great and after receiving a few pics I wish I could unsee and sending a few I wish I could take back , we decided to meet up for well... you know.

So I'm at this coffee shop down the street waiting for my man to show up and you know who walks in . It is at this moment I realize my FU, I've been flirting with my gay hating closeted uncle.  He tried to play it off like a random encounter but I wasn't letting him get away with that. After some pressing he finally admits that he is the man I've been talking to and I told him I don't judge him like he does me . He apologized for the hurtful things he's said to me over the years 

He kept talking with me like he was still INTERESTED and I had to make it clear that was NOT going to happen . I had to get up and walk out and after multiple texts from him I had to go ahead and block his number. I can't believe this guy had the nerve to judge me and treat me like less of a human being all these years when he's a total creep and a massive hypocrite.

Always get a face pic, people.

TL:DR: chatted and eventually met up with a potential hookup that turned out to be my homophobic uncle . Should have insisted on the face pic"
"TIFU by trying to buy an Instant Pot at Target and probably ending up on a terrorist watchlist


This started yesterday but I didn't realize my FU until today.
Yesterday, I stumbled on a price mistake for the 6 qt Instant Pot at Target, they were ringing up at $10 a piece instead of $80. I decided I would get some Christmas shopping done early and flip a few. I ordered 10 for in store pick up and 10 for delivery in case either order got canceled.
Well the delivery order was canceled but a got an email that the in store pickup was ready. I go to Target and give them my ID, they look it up and can't find it at first. I give them the order number and I hear the one guy say to the other something about it being canceled and they are both giving my odd looks. The one says he has to let the manager know I'm there so they radio over and the manager says it was canceled because of the price mistake. Seems a little odd that they needed the manager over the radio just for that but I didn't think much of it.
Fast forward to a little earlier this afternoon. The doorbell rings and my wife comes and tells me there are 2 guys at the door asking for me. I step outside and they identify themselves as detectives from the State Police Counter Terrorism Unit and they start questioning me about why I'm trying to buy 10 pressure cookers and if I know what they can be used for, if I'm making bombs and so on; they even have a picture of my car from in the Target parking lot. I did my best to explain the price mistake and how I found it, etc. I think they accepted my explanation but I'm still nervous that I'm on a watchlist now.

TL:DR tried to take advantage of a price mistake and buy 10 Instant Pots at Target, got interrogated by State Police Counter Terrorism Unit why I was buying 10 pressure cookers that could be used to make bombs."
"TIFU by being young and dumb I guess


I was 16 when this happened. Golden age of fuck ups. 

I hooked up with one of the girls from my church. We were on opposite ends of the spectrum when it came to religious obligations. I was more of an observer in our church. Whereas as she was fully devoted to serving the Big G. However the two of us shared one common goal. We wanted to fuck. Which we did. But afterwards she was overcome with religious guilt and without warning me went straight to our pastor to confess her ""carnal sins"". She named and shamed both of us. None of this would've been that bad if it wasn't for the fucked up fact that our pastor was also my damn father. 

So thanks to that confession, that's how my dad found out his virgin son dipped his doodle in the Deacon's daughter. 

**TL:DR Fornicated with a Christian girl. She went mad with guilt and confessed all our dirty deeds the pastor of our church. Aka my dad.**"
"TIFU by losing my right testicle in a ball slapping contest


Obligatory ""didn't happen today"" but four years ago when I was 17.

Also no need for a throwaway account since pretty much everyone I know have heard the story.

&amp;#x200B;

My friend and I were in the sauna and he gets an idea that we should see which one of us could make our balls clap louder by hip thrusting back and forth and I was like ""yeah haha let's do that!"" So there we were, two straight dudes standing in the sauna hip thrusting away and laughing at the sound our sacks made. My friend won the contest and we sat down. I started to feel a little uncomfortable. Like someone was squeezing my right nut. It didn't hurt that much when I was sitting down but once I got out of the sauna and went to take a shower the pain level spiked suddenly. My vision went blurry and ears started ringing from the pain (and possibly dehydration from furiously hip thrusting in an 80 ° C sauna). I dragged myself to the kitchen and sat down. My friend brought me a glass of water and I chugged it down in one go. I told him that my testicle hurts like never before and asked if he had any painkillers. He asked me if I preferred paracetamol or ibuprofen, I said I'll have both. I chewed the pills and swallowed them without water or anything, usually I require generous amounts of water but this time it was an emergency. I laid down on his bed for a while and when the pain was at a tolerable level I told him that I'm going to head home. I had ridden my moped there so I had to ride it home as well. It was winter and the roads were bumpy. Each bump felt like someone punched me in the ball sack but I managed to get home. Once I got home I walked  straight to my room and wet to sleep. Usually I stay up late so my mom came to see me and asked why I went to sleep so early. She was worried that I had been drinking or taken drugs so I just told her that I almost fainted and want to sleep now. In the morning when I woke up the pain had eased but my testicle was oddly shaped and still a bit sore so I rode my moped to school and went to the school nurse straight away. She examined my ball and wrote me a referral to a hospital. When I got home from school I showed the referral to my dad and he drove me to the hospital. There they took a urine sample and an ultrasound. We waited for the results and an hour later a surgeon comes almost running to me and told me that I had a testicular torsion and that we would be going to the operating room immediately. A nurse handed me hospital clothes and my dad took all my personal belongings. I changed my clothes and lied down on the hospital bed and they rushed me through the hospital to the operating room. I was put to sleep and when I woke up in the recovery ward I immediately sat up. A nurse noticed me and told me about the surgery. They tried to restore the blood flow to my testicle but it had already gone necrotic and it had to be removed. I started laughing hysterically (probably due to the medication and anesthetics). The nurse informed my parents and they came to visit me an hour later. They were shocked about my condition and asked me how I was feeling ""as a man"" but I told them that I just find it funny how one one can lose a testicle in a ball slapping contest. 

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR Had a hip thrusting contest with my friend to see who could clap one's balls loudest, ended up losing the contest and my right testicle."
"TIFU by ordering food online amd essentially setting restaurant on fire with the help of bee movie script


Ok guys, gonna make it short. This happened like a year ago, but i just remembered it and wanned to share  


It was around noon, was feeling hungry, so i headed to my countries version of uber eats to order some nice lunch. Found the food i liked, proceeded to checkout and noticed, that the box where you can leave some message for the restaurant had no limit for characters.  
So i got an idea, to ""prank"" the restaurant by copypasting entire bee movie script there, so it will get printed on the receipt. Thats where ithe FU happened. Few mins after i sent the order, got message it was canceled .. ok no big deal, might happen, so i wanned to order the some food somewhere else, when i noticed some black-ish smoke in a distance (im was that far away, but was studying and didnt wanna leave my spot in library). Well shortly after also like 2 firetrucs passed by, heading the restaurants direction. (ps: was on ground floor, ""wall"" was from glass, so you could easily se on the street)  
The next day i read in local newspapers, that the exact restaurant caught fire because of some cash register malfunction

TL;DR: Ordered food online and set restaurant on fire by pasting bee movie script into the order-note box"
"TIFU by making everyone in the elevator think that they were going to die.


Alright, so this is an old story, but when I found this sub, I had to share.

When I used to be a Muslim, I had an app on my phone that would sound the adhaan, when it was time for prayer.

I was on holiday the day of the fuckup. I got into a hotel elevator, this was shortly after the Paris attacks. There were roughly six people in it. Then the adhaan for prayer started blasting from my phone. For those who don’t know, the adhaan starts with allahu Akbar. When that blasted from my phone, the elevator went into mass hysteria, people were crying, screaming, another man tackled me and held me down. I had to explain to them that I wasn’t a terrorist. Then everyone just started laughing.

I understand that everyone may think this isn’t a fuckup, but I feel like I shouldn’t have had my adhaan blasting like that after an incident like the Paris attacks.

Tl;Dr: adhaan blares in elevator, everyone thinks I’m about to blow up the elevator."
"TIFU By having, what is hopefully, the strangest sexual experience I encounter. NSFW


Literally happened a half hour ago.

Husband and I have been together 15 years.  We are both open minded and confident when it comes to sex so there is little we haven't done and we love it all.  Nothing is gross or weird with us when we're getting off.

He asked me to help wax his balls a few days ago.  I did.  Unfortunately the one section of skin came off with the wax strip.  It was about the size of a quarter but he's tough and didn't complain.

I walk out of the master bathroom to find him jerking off.  He's not home 90% of the year because of work so I, of course, wanted to help him despite staying up late drinking and fucking and therefore worrying the motion of a blow job or getting fucked might make me nauseous which would ruin the mood.  I thought ""I'll lick his perfect balls and help by applying pressure to the base of his dick right under his balls"".  

He's loving it.  I'm loving licking and sucking and cradling his balls, independently and simultaneously, in my mouth.

I feel something as I'm making circles with my tongue.  No big deal whether it's hair or lint whatever so I quickly pull my finger and thumb up to retrieve the foreign, unknown object.  As I pluck it off my tongue (trying not to miss a beat of our quality time) I glance at it.  It's grey and slimy, bunched up and longer than my longest fingernail.  It took a half a second to realize that I had literally sucked the scab off my husband's balls.  

TL;DR - Exfoliated husband's balls with my mouth."
"TIFU By Masturbating Almost Every Day in the Shower for a Few Years then Discovering Why it Won’t Drain.


As many young men find themselves the urge to please themselves, I too had found enjoyment in this. I had masturbated in the shower almost every time I took one. It became just a part of my routine: soap, shampoo, masturbate. I did this for about three years. I had never noticed any real drainage problems from built up semen or anything until today. I was taking a shower and found myself standing in still water after I’m done. I decide to wait until it drains then after the water is gone, I unscrewed the drain cover and behold, a solid block of hair and mystery substances all held together with my very own semen glue.

I instantly winced at the site. The smell that found itself protruding out was the most unbearable smell I have ever smelled in my entire life. I almost threw up. There was a small gap on the side that water must’ve seeped through to drain which would likely close up soon. I decide I must take care of this before someone else tries to take a shower and discovers my masterpiece. I grab a fork, because that was the best tool I could think of at the moment, and try to scoop the sludge out. Instead, the cheap fork I had chosen almost bends and I learned that wasn’t going to work. I needed an upgrade so I grabbed a hammer and chisel and started going at it. I also took a drill with the largest bit I had and drilled holes through the gloop so that I could break it easier. I told my family that I was just fixing the towel bar because I pulled it out of the wall to avoid any suspicions about the clatter. I work at clearing this out for about an hour. Half way through my body gave in and I heave up my dinner all over the shower so I had to clean that too. 

I clear the solid just to find a new layer which is less of a solid and more of a sticky layer of the same things. Close to peanut butter. I scoop this out and then I regurgitate whatever was left in my body. After again cleaning this vomit, I discover the final layer which consists of a chunky, gray soup with hair, semen, and now my new addition of vomit at the bottom but out of reach. There was no way I was going to be able to clean this so my work would have to suffice. I put all the substance in a plastic bag to throw away. The bag must’ve weighed over five pounds. I put the cover back on and went downstairs to throw the bag away outside which is when I noticed the smell. That putrid stench had carried itself all over the house and was noticed by my mother. I told her that I had also noticed the drain was “a little clogged” so I cleared it up. She decided she’ll buy some drain cleaner tomorrow to use. I then spent the next half hour deodorizing the house with a whole can of Febreeze. I am now sitting here typing this, partially scarred and now knowing that I will be sure to tell my future kids not to jack off in the shower or else they will have to deal with the infamous gray sludge. 

TL;DR
I masturbated in the shower daily for over three years. My shower stopped draining well so I took a look and discovered my semen had combined with hair and other things to solidify and clog the drain. I spent an hour chiseling away and discovered a gray soup at the bottom that can’t be reached then have to purify the entire house from the smell it let off."
"TIFU by disrespecting the shortest woman I've ever seen, within 2 minutes.


This happened last Saturday and the cringe is still eating me up. I'll keep it short for you peeps.

Last Saturday was Kingsday in the Netherlands. To sum it all up: Everywhere you go there are kids selling shit and parties. My friends and I decided to go to a festival and join the party club. We arrive and sooner than later I lose my friends, as is tradition. I start texting my friends asking where they went, a bit of back and forth and I got their location. Mission acquired. 


I notice I have to go past this big stage full with people to get to my friends. As I start my journey in to the abyss I walk past this VERY  small woman. Like, really really REALLY small. Not a MIDGET! Don't confuse her with one of them, I've seen my share of midgets and she definitely wasn't one. A woman, around 25/30 years old that seems to have just, shronken. She shrunk to the size of a 8 year old. I was blown away to say the least. The drugs and booze didn't help me either.

Seeing as I'm 6'11"", the ratio between us was fucking insane. I could probably lift her up with 1 hand, no joking. Kick her out of the festival ground as if she was a soccer ball. You get the idea. I start a conversation and straight up start talking about her height, in hindsight that was probably very rude and intimidating. While talking to her about her shortness and how blown away I was I notice I was getting weird looks from her friends. Then it hit me. I was standing like [this](https://previews.123rf.com/images/mangostar/mangostar1706/mangostar170600341/79673282-sportif-fatiguÃ©-s-appuyant-sur-les-genoux-Ã -l-extÃ©rieur.jpg) while talking to her. Most likely with a facial expression like [this](https://thumbs.dreamstime.com/z/happy-boy-child-leaning-forward-hands-knees-smiling-30374249.jpg)

I stand up straight and apologize by blurring out: ""Owh shit. I, uuh, I shouldn't stand like that, huh?"" Shorty says yes, you shouldn't. I just straight up bounced after that. fuck.

Fast forward to a couple hours later I found my friends. We just chilling when 1 of the girls gets a few texts. She looks at her phone and asks me wtf i've done. Shorty knows her, shorty saw her with me, shorty asks her why she standing with me.


TL;DR  I'm tall, met shortest woman I've ever seen. Stood very disrespectfull infront of her. Seriously, it isn't that long.

 Gonna hide in my bed now :("
"TIFU by coming into work early to try and impress the boss.


I work at a mid size company with around 30 employees, all the employees start at 7 AM with the exception of the Owner/boss and myself who prefer to start at 6. I have a project coming to a close and promised to have it ready for next Monday. I thought it was a good idea to come in a few hours early so 3:30 to get a head start and impress the boss. I show up right at 3:30. I unlocked the door and went to punch in my alarm code..... I completely forgot my code, I've entered it thousands of times and I just forgot. The alarm started going off and simultaneously the phone rang it was the alarm company calling for my code and I couldn't provide it. They ended up calling the owners home phone and he rushed over to turn off the alarm then of course got in an accident with an un-insured driver, had to pay everything out of pocket..... I also missed the deadline.

Tldr; went in early to impress the boss, set off the alarm, he came in to turn it off and got in an accident on the way, wasn't impressed."
"TIFU by trying to put deodorant on in an airplane bathroom


Husband just messaged me mid-flight with this story (his FU not mine, but shared with his permission):  
""So I got up to put some deodorant on in the bathroom. The kind with the roller ball. I go to put it on and nothing is coming out. So I do a quick flick of it to get the liquid inside moving. Worst case scenario The roller bar goes flying off and liquid deodorant goes flying everywhere. Mirror, walls, floor... E v e r y w h e r e...  


Even worse... The deodorant is the exact color and consistency of semen. The bathroom looked like 10 guys had an orgy. My pants are also covered with this substance. I cleaned it up the best I could but I am horrified at what people will think if I missed a spot (I debated about telling the attendant but I am 99% sure I got everything. The worst part is I didn't even get to use it.""  


TL;DR My husband tried to put deodorant while on his flight and instead made it look like he had a mile high sex party."
"TIFU by confessing to my friend I wanted to fuck her


Obligatory this happened on Monday. So, I have been single for a while and a friend of mine gave me a contact last year, saying you and this girl will probably get along well. And that we did, from December to this month we have steadily been growing closer and having tonnes of fun along the way. Sans sexual flirting though. I even nicknamed her my almost soulmate because things just flowed between us. Until last week Friday when I decided to visit her for Easter (she stays in a nearby city).

Now remember I've been single for a long time.  And my raging-hormone to logic ratio is at an all time high, thanks to a total lack of outlets. So when she said the entire visit should be spent indoors I thought Finally. This is where it happens. I packed 2 condoms to the visit and sprayed deo like a mad man. Got there and things were going great really, until after one hour of YouTube videos I got nervous and then desperate BUT I didn't make a move. For some reason I believed something would magically happen and we would end up in sexy time. You can imagine my inevitable disappointment when I had to leave.

So just before we parted she suggested we take pictures and I said cool but really all I could think about was how I had failed at the only booty chance I had had in a year. Needless to say I didn't look overly enthusiastic, or even remotely happy on the pictures. Which apparently bothered her as she thought I didn't want pics with her because she is ugly (which she isn't) and for the weekend she kept on bringing it up and I kept on saying I was really anxious to travel back home in time. Which of course she didn't buy and eventually I thought hey let me just tell her the truth. So on Monday I sent her a pic of the condoms and explained my disappointment and sexual frustration, trying to reassure her that she isn't ugly. 

And now, well, its been 3 days since we spoke. Thanks, Hormone Monster.

**TL;DR: Confessed that I was disappointed we didn't get to sexy time with a good friend and now she won't text me**"
"TIFU by wearing the wrong underwear to my kids field trip.


This happened yesterday but I’m feeling the repercussions today. 

It started with me getting dressed and just throwing on lace underwear vs cotton. I was just staying home all day so it wasn’t a big deal because after my kid leaves for school I walk around naked anyways. 

My kid reminds me that I have volunteered for his field trip and here’s a list of kids that I would be watching. 

I forgot so... Shit! I don’t have a lunch for him or I so I threw jeans on to go run to get a lunch. I figured I could change when I got back no biggie. However... My husband text me asking for me to get some things from the store that had to be picked up immediately. 

I had no time to change and made it to the field trip 10 min late. Fine, it’s fine. I’ll be ok. It’s 75degrees, I’m in jeans, lace undies, vagina freshly shaved from the night before. I didn’t think much of it. 

There’s a lot of walking on this field trip though. I’m keeping up with the 8-9 year olds and I feel my underwear pull up between the lips of my vagina. So half my vagina is rubbing the lace and jeans while I walk. 

I can’t fix it at any point and at this age I couldn’t just adjust and lie about tucking in my shirt etc. This is the age boobs and “lady parts” are a big deal. 

So for three hours my vagina is rubbing against uncomfortable fabric. It’s hot so my natural discharge and sweat are making it worse. I can’t adjust because the bathrooms are too far away for me to leave the kids and NONE of the little terds had to go! 

I got home and half my vagina was rubbed raw. My husband said it looked swollen or like a big ingrown hair was forming. So no sex and as a woman, I don’t like to waste a nicely shaved vagina. 

Today I am wide legged and have a fan going between my legs with no pants because just walking to the bathroom stings. 

Tl;dr- I shaved my vagina so had no hair buffer when my lady meat fell out of lace undies and chaffed during a three hour walk-a-thon field trip. My vagina lips are swollen and it hurts to be a functioning human."
"TIFU by 'sending' my girlfriend a dick pic


Literally happened a few minutes ago. Still shaking and crying and laughing a bit.

So it's late night, currently 2:23AM as I write this, and I was feeling horny. Decided to send my girlfriend a dick pic. 

Here's the fuckup: I added it to my FUCKING STORY instead of sending it to my girlfriend. 

I didn't realise at all.

About half an hour later (a few minutes ago) my best friend DMs me: 

&gt;REALLYFUCKINGHORNY WTF 😂😂

There it is. My fully erect dick in my hand, with the caption 'hi bb owo x'

I almost fucking died. ""WHY IS THERE A DICK ON YOUR STORY"" 
My only response to this? Sending 'bruh' with fucked up spelling over and over before I finally head on to my story to delete that mess. Luckily only my best friend saw it, and now we're even since I've seen his too.

In conclusion, r/tifu, I'm feeling a sweet mix of wanting to die with uncontrollably laughing.
Don't take your friends for granted, they'll let you know if you accidentally put your dick on your Instagram story. Needless to say I will be buying my friend a pint and serving him with my fucking life until this blows over. What a bro.

*TL;DR*: Feeling frisky, tried to send girlfriend a dick pic, accidentally sent it to my story and my best friend let me know before anyone else saw."
"TIFU by playing a home-made video in my hotel room NSFW


So this situation started last night. 

I live in the UK but the company I work for is HQed in Ireland so I spend a few nights a week there in a hotel. It just so happens that this is a super high-end hotel but we get a good corporate rate there so it works out pretty reasonable.

My girlfriend lives in Ireland and she was staying with me, and we decided to make some sex videos on my phone. I’ll spare you the full details, but let’s just say these videos were particularly dirty and verbal, with lots of slurping and gagging noises and references to my dick size.

Anyway we finish around 3-4am, and I decide to start watching some of videos back but the sound on my stupid phone isn’t working. I make sure the volume is fully up and the silent switch is off, but no luck. I play the videos a few more times and just figured that my phone is bust.

Suddenly the people in the upstairs room start stomping around and I’m thinking wtf is their problem don’t they know it’s 4am. Then I realise FUCK my Bluetooth is connected to their speaker - I WAS IN THAT ROOM LAST WEEK. The audio from my sex videos was blaring out in these poor people’s bedroom presumably while they were sleeping.

So today I’m checking out and an American guy is furious with the front desk agent telling her that the radio started playing porn in his room and that he and his wife have never been so disgusted. The agent says the hotel will perform a full investigation.

TL;DR made some sex tapes on my phone, didn’t realise my phone had connected to the speaker of the room I was in last week and I woke up some poor people with gagging noises."
"TIFU by drinking NyQuil at work not knowing what it was


Obligatory disclaimer: this actually happened yesterday, but as you'll soon find out, I was in no condition to type this out yesterday.

&amp;#x200B;

I've been suffering from a really bad cold in conjunction with some of the worst allergies I've ever experienced. Yesterday I showed up to the grocery store where I work feeling feverish, sounding quite hoarse and nursing a somewhat serious cough, as well as some other symptoms. I felt pretty terrible and under the weather but it wasn't anything serious enough to prevent me from working that day.

&amp;#x200B;

It's important to mention that I come from a family that swears by homeopathics. I'm a young adult still living with my parents and it's somewhat difficult to find name-brand medication in my house. My parents insist on trying to cure sicknesses with herbal tea and castor oil and stuff like that. Due to this, I haven't had a lot of exposure to name-brand medication, and am pretty unfamiliar with most of it (NyQuil included).

&amp;#x200B;

I struggled through the first half of my shift and then clocked out for my lunch break. I went into the breakroom and started preparing my lunch, making small talk with the other employees who were back there. One of these employees is someone that I generally trust and hold in high esteem. However, he has a dry and somewhat sarcastic sense of humor, which can sometimes make it difficult to tell if he's joking or not. He'd found a bottle of NyQuil in the first aid kit in the bathroom and (jokingly) offered it to me, saying, ""Here, drink about half of this. It'll make you feel better.""

&amp;#x200B;

Obviously if I'd known what NyQuil was, I would have realized he was joking. Either way, I was feeling really terrible and I was getting kind of desperate, so I figured I'd at least give it a try. I'd seen NyQuil advertised on television and stuff, so I vaguely knew that it was supposed to suppress coughing. I picked up the bottle and read through the label and didn't see anything that made me think twice about drinking the stuff at work, so I took a disposable cup and poured half the bottle into it. I then proceeded to fuckin DOWN that bitch. It tasted really sweet and kinda gross but it wasn't the worst thing I'd ever tasted. I was kind of out of it at the time, so I didn't really think twice about the fact that I *hadn't even bothered to check whether I'd consumed the appropriate dosage*. It honestly didn't even cross my mind to check. Not my smartest move.

&amp;#x200B;

I didn't realize I fucked up until about a half hour later, after the end of my lunch break. I was clocked back in and I was helping to bring in the pallets full of boxes that came off of the delivery truck, still with a good 3 or 4 hours to go in my shift. I wasn't feeling much different, maybe a little calmer than normal, but nothing too drastic. I had a supply manifest and I was going through and marking off all the boxes in order to double check that we'd received everything we ordered, making small talk with my supervisor as we went. I was coughing pretty badly while we were doing this, so eventually my supervisor made me stop for a second and asked if I was ok.

&amp;#x200B;

Supervisor: Dude, you sound pretty horrible right now. You should pop over to the drugstore and pick up some Claritin or something.

&amp;#x200B;

Me: Oh, I went there earlier. I took some Sudafed, some Zyrtec, and some NyQuil.

&amp;#x200B;

Supervisor: …You took *NyQuil*?

&amp;#x200B;

Me: *(realizing I fucked up)* …Yeah.

&amp;#x200B;

Supervisor: How the fuck are you awake right now?

&amp;#x200B;

Me: *(realizing NyQuil is the one that puts you to sleep, and DayQuil is the other one)* …well I drank some coffee earlier, so I guess it's because of that.

&amp;#x200B;

Supervisor: You got a real nice cocktail of drugs in your system. Let me know if you need to go home.

&amp;#x200B;

Me: Nah, I think I'll stick it out.

&amp;#x200B;

The NyQuil didn't really start to kick in until a half hour after that. I started feeling really drowsy and woozy. Everything was slower and it felt like I was moving through Jell-O. I was trying to read the supply manifest but it kept blurring in and out of focus and all I could think about was *SLEEEEEEEEEEP* so I went and I started downing a ton of coffee which just made things worse. I started getting the shakes. My hands and thighs wouldn't stop trembling and I started getting this weird sensation of pressure around my ankles. I developed one hell of a headache and a sudden urge to blink a lot more than normal. On top of everything it started to feel like I was watching myself through a TV screen, like I wasn't really there in person. All my actions felt delayed and whenever someone spoke to me it sounded like their voices were coming from really far away. My balance was off and my brain was just on this constant loop of ""i don't like this i don't like this i don't like this i don't like this"" which wasn't helping my productivity. I didn't want to go home because I'd already told my supervisor that I would stick it out and I didn't think it was worth it to leave early when I only had a couple of hours left in my shift, but those couple of hours just stretched and stretched and they became some of the most uncomfortable hours I can remember.

&amp;#x200B;

I was the laughingstock of the store for a couple hours since it was painfully obvious that I was completely fucked up on something. I kept talking about how uncomfortable I was and staring off into space randomly during conversations. I was swaying on my feet and I'm pretty sure I made it into a few people's Snapchat stories that night. On the bright side, TIL me on NyQuil is probably funnier than regular me.

&amp;#x200B;

I somehow made it through, so after clocking out I went to go find my supervisor and apologize to him. I promised him I'd be a drug-free, functioning human being upon my return to work the next day. Luckily I was with the chill, somewhat drug-friendly supervisor instead of literally any of the other ones. He just told me ""tonight never happened"" and to keep my mouth shut about it (which is obviously why I'm posting it to Reddit lol), but I'm glad it ended this way since it could have gone a lot worse.

&amp;#x200B;

I biked (very slowly) home and almost got run over because I was too busy dissociating from reality instead of watching the road, but in the end I made it home safely. As soon as I made it in my bedroom door, I went Sicko Mode.

&amp;#x200B;

*had me out like a light, yuh*

&amp;#x200B;

TL:DR Didn't know what NyQuil was and drank half a bottle in the middle of my shift. Tried to counter it with coffee and ended up super crossfaded and uncomfortable in front of all my coworkers and my supervisor."
"TIFU by asking my upstairs neighbors to not be loud during midday sex


Welp. It's worse than you're thinking, i promise.

I get it's impossible to never hear your neighbors during apparent living--it happens. I was trying to finish a commission while i had some free time today and keep hearing something weird even though I'm wearing headphones to listen to music. I take one bud out to listen and realize it's coming from above; awkwardly realizing it's a bed smacking the wall and the faint ""oh!""s of a woman. No problem; i put my earbud back in, crank up the volume, and get back to work.

Not even five minutes later i hear it again, OVER MY MUSIC.  Thinking I'm nuts, in yank off the earbuds and i swear to whatever deity you believe in it sounded like they were in my apartment, in another room!!  I'm thinking to myself ""jfc his dick can't be THAT good that you have to let the lifeforms on Mars know about it too!!""

Luckily it was over fairly quickly after that situation, so cut to a few hours later. I'm returning to my apartment from running some errands and while I'm unlocking my door, a man and woman are coming down the stairwell. I've seen her around plenty and we've spoken each time but this is my first time meeting him. So we exchange hello's and i jokingly mentioned the noise to segway into asking them to maybe just be aware of how much noise they're making next time.  I'm not gonna complain on them but I'd rather not have to listen to them if i don't have to, you know?

Well... their reactions are a little strange, so I'm thinking 'oh man i just embarrassed tf out of them gdi I'm such an asshole i shouldn't have said anything'. But before i can apologize, he suddenly turns to her and shouts, ""Did you fuck my brother!?"" And i realized then why she was making the face she was making at me...

I don't think me and her are gonna be acquaintances anymore.



TL;DR: Asked my upstairs neighbors to not broadcast when they're doing the do, only to out the woman to her man for cheating on him with his brother."
"TIFU by chemically burning my dick and my wife’s tits


So technically this happened awhile ago, but I just found this sub and want to share this embarrassing and fucked up moment with you all for a good laugh. This is really long but trust me, it’s a story that keeps on giving. 

To start off, my wife really likes Lush products. While we were on vacation we went to a Lush store to pick some up for our home, because we don’t have a store nearby. While shopping she found this “Rainbow” clay bath bomb. It’s not like a normal bath bomb, it almost feels like clay/dough but it does fizz and feels supper smooth. 

One night she came up to me, all feisty and shit, and said she wanted to get weird in the tub with some of the stuff she got. Of course I couldn’t get undressed fast enough. So I awkwardly sprint to the bathroom while taking my clothes off, run into every wall and door imaginable, then start the bath. 

She comes in a little later holding the clay bath bomb and says “I want to rub your dick with this until you cum”.  This was the only moment of clarity I had the entire night. I said “that’s a bath bomb, I doubt that would feel good”. Without responding she grabs a piece, gets it wet and starts going to town. I’ll admit, it felt pretty fucking awesome, so I grabbed some and started rubbing it on her body and then her nipples. IT WAS AMAZING, for about two minutes.... 

Then, out of nowhere, my dick started to burn as if I had stuck it into a fire-ant hill. I quickly turned to rinse it off but the hot water made it so much worse. Eventually, I was able to get it off but the damage was done. My dick was as red and blister as an albino who was left out in the sun too long. It was bad. 

That night I slept naked as to avoid anything touching it and the next morning I went to urgent care. My wife was too embarrassed to get her newly developed pepperoni nipples checked out so I went alone. 

So I walk into the urgent care with my ass sticking out while waddling like a penguin to keep my dick off my shorts and tell the receptionist what’s going on. This is the conversation that ensued. 

Rep- what can o help you with? 
Me- (trying to be as casual and nonchalant as possible) oh just a chemical burn, wanna get it checked out.  
Rep- where? 
Me- (I look around and softly whisper) on my genitals...
Rep- I didn’t here that. Where? 
Me- (slightly louder) my genitals.... 
at this point I get a glance from another patient filling out paperwork right next to me and I die inside...  
Rep- oh... okay.... I’ll get you in ASAP. 

So I wait to be seen, and then the nurse comes to get me. Which, by the way, was a fucking dime and I had to explain everything to her. You can tell she’s dying inside but trying to be professional then says the doc would be in to see me. 

As soon as she leaves I hear here bump into the doc and he asks what’s going on. I can hear their entire convo. 

Her- He’s got a chemical burn on his genitalia. 
Doc- on his dick!? 
Her- Yeah.... its bad. 
Doc- (while laughing he says) well fuck, I’ll go in now. 

*actual convo, not embellished at all, this doc was funny* 

So the doc comes in and the first thing he says is “I heard you burned your dick!”. Funniest shit ever, and I told him i did. He then said “well bust it out let’s take a look at what’s left!” I’m fucking laughing my ass off at this point and he proceeds to examine me. I’m prescribed some ointment and told to wrap it in gauze and tape it so it doesn’t fall off. He told me to tell my wife to tape her nipples too. 

He gives me the stuff and sends me on my way. As I’m leaving I see all the other nurses and docs just looking at me. You can tell they all knew lol. 

The only upside of the story was that while wearing my gauzed and taped dick my bulge look massive. So that was neat. 

This was super embarrassing but too funny to not share. Hope you enjoyed the read and had a good laugh. 

TL;DR

don’t use a bath bomb during sex, it’ll burn your dick."
"TIFU by posting pictures of my formerly feral cat's gender reveal on Facebook


TIFU by trying to be funny on FB. 

This actually happened on Saturday, and the chaos has just died down.

My friends have been following my journey to tame a feral cat that emerged from under my shed back in December. Thankfully I live in Florida (pretty sure that's a sentence never uttered before), so the cat stayed warm during the winter due to the blankets and beds my husband and I put out near its preferred home. We also bought a huge canopy to keep it dry and fed it regularly. 

This kitty is super floofy in its rear end area, and I didn't want to go digging around a possibly diseased cat's sensitive spots because I have indoor cats, so we were unsure if it was a girl or a boy. I've been posting regularly on my personal Facebook about the cat, who is a particularly stunning specimen of feline. All of our friends kept asking about the gender.

My birthday fell on the day it had surgery. We had the cat fixed, microchipped, tested, vaccinated, literally everything we could do. That happened on a weekday, and I wanted to give Floof (temporary name, maybe) time to recover from anesthesia and the procedure. I decided that since I was going to have friends over for some birthday wine and cake that weekend anyway, why not be ridiculous and get a gender reveal cake?! We can celebrate the cat being healthy and spayed/neutered and I'm happy to share my birthday with cats anytime!

I posted the gender reveal cake on a cat meme/picture Facebook group the next day, and now I'm a cishet who doesn't understand how damaging gender reveal cakes are to trans people. I've enforced gender roles that are insulting to the transgender population. My post has almost 10k likes/hates. I've apparently made the LBGTQ community uncomfortable, completely unintentionally, by trying to be funny on my birthday. In reality, I was just doing it because I thought it would be funny to tell all of my friends that our cat had balls (there were blue balls in the cake; see picture). 

TL;DR- I'm apparently a terribly intolerant person and am getting threats and lectures on my FB account because I bought a gender reveal cake for a cat."
