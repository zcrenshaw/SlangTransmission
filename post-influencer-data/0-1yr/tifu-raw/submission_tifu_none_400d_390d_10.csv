0,"TIFU by posting a pic to reddit and destroying my career


Obligatory ""this happened several months ago.""

For the past 20 years, basically right out of college, I worked in closed captioning and subtitling. This involves transcribing television programs and movies and timing the transcription to sync to the video.  It's a lot of typing and even more watching a bizarrely varied amount of TV and film.

I worked for several companies around the country. What started as a ""just for now"" job grew into a career, I became production director in a few organizations, and I became one of the fastest captioners in the country. When my company in New York City shut down, I found myself in possession of a very expensive piece of captioning software and a fair amount of clients, so I began working freelance.

The clients began to dwindle as more and more work started going overseas, but I was working steadily based on one Huge Client that had robust Netflix, HBO, and Hulu contracts, and the rates they paid were ridiculously large. If you ever watched Chicago PD or Ray Donovan with the subtitles turned on, that was me.

For the first time in my life, I was able to put money away for retirement, travel to Europe, go out to eat without checking my balance, never worry about the bank account running dry, all while working maybe 4 hours a day out of my bedroom walk-in closet. It was a magnificent few years.

One day, I am captioning a Disney Channel cartoon that I had never seen before, and in one scene, a child is hanging his doodles in an art gallery. One of the doodles is of Trogdor the Burninator of Homestar Runner fame. ""He lives on!"" I think, and then, being a hopeless reddit addict, I post a screenshot to the Homestar sub and forget all about it.

Fast forward three months when I get an email from Huge Client investigating a ""very serious matter"" in which a screenshot of a cartoon had been posted to reddit. Turns out, the cartoon had never aired before. Turns out, Disney was pissed. Turns out, the list of suspects that had access to the video was very short. 

I took immediate responsibility and profusely apologized, but the damage had been done. I had boneheadedly violated every nondisclosure and employee contract I'd signed with them by posting that single screenshot, and they terminated all future dealings with me, voided the $6,000 in invoices I had outstanding, and stated in very polite terms that I was lucky Disney wasn't suing my pasty white ass.

After the fallout settled, I had no steady income. A few commercials and YouTube broadcasts that needed subtitles, but nothing reliable, and NYC rent drains bank accounts quickly. I reached out to every other captioning outfit in the country, but no luck. So, that left me at 40 with a staggeringly narrow and largely obsolete skill set forced to start over from square one. I am currently working for the Postal Service doing blue-collar work in 90-degree heat and mourning the days when watching TV in my jammies till 3 PM was my job.

All gone because of a reddit post of a forgettable cartoon that only got a measly 150 updoots.

TLDR: I violated the terms of an absurdly kushy job by posting to reddit, and now I deliver packages."
1,"TIFU by my wife and I referring to ""No"" as the ""N Word"" with our 12 month old son and having Child Protective Services called on us


So my wife and I have a four year old and a one year old.  When our one year old is up to mischief and we tell him ""no"" he immediately looks up at us and starts crying.  It's actually pretty adorable.

In order not to upset him we frequently refer to it as the ""N Word"" when he's around.  

Queue two weeks ago when our four year old is in daycare and telling all his friends and the teacher that ""mommy and daddy use the N Word all the time and it upsets his brother and makes him cry"".  Teacher berated my wife and told her we were horrible people and didn't really get it when my wife explained that it was a big mix up.

We also got Child Protective Services called on us anonymously.  Think it's the teacher but it may have been a parent.

TLDR: Everyone at our kids school thinks we are constantly throwing ""the bad N word"" around our sons and are horrible people and parents.

2,"TIFU by Reading Contract Law Textbooks to my 2 Year Old


Obligatory this happened 7 years ago, as my son is now 9, and this decision as now come back to haunt us.

I graduated law school in December 2007 and passed the bar exam in February 2008.  I kept my BarBri materials as I was going to trade with a friend who took the bar in a state I was debating taking it in, but that never worked out, so they remained in the office.

Our son was born in 2009 and this happened in 2011-12.  He was not any easy child to get to go to bed and we would often read to him for hours.  One night I had enough and decided to find the most boring thing I could, so I pulled out my Barbri Book on Contracts and started reading it.  He was fascinated and demanded I read more and more.  He'd ask questions, like any good Dad I answered.  So I was teaching my 2.5-3 year old contract law, and eventually more advanced contract law.  

Fast forward to Kindergarten.  He got upset with his teacher one day because she entered into a verbal contract to give them an extra recess if they did X and Y.  Well they did, but it rained, so she couldn't give them the time.  This did not sit well, as our son proceeded to lecture her on the elements of a verbal contract and how one was created and she breached it.  She had no answer for him, and we had a talk about it with her.

Unfortunately, this behavior didn't stop.  He would negotiate with adults for things he wanted, and if he felt he performed his side of the contract, he would get angry if they breached.  He will explain to them what the offer was, how he accepted it, and what was the consideration.  And if they were the ones who made the offer, he would point out any ambiguity was in his favor.   When they tried pointing out kids can't enter contracts, he counters with if an adult offers the contract, they must perform their part if the child did their part and they cannot use them being a child to withhold performance.  

This eventually progressed to him negotiating contracts and deals with his classmates.  Only now he knew to put things in writing, and would get his friends to sign promissory notes.  He knew these weren't enforceable, but would point out his friends did not know this.   We eventually got him to stop this by understanding he couldn't be mad because he knows they can't form a contract.  

It culminated in Third Grade when he negotiated with his teacher to have an extra recess.  This time, he remembered to have her agree that she would honor it later if it rained (which it did).  So then she said she wouldn't, and he lost it and had to see the principal.   Who agreed with him and talked to the teacher.

Now that this happened, we had to also see the Principal to discuss this.  She is astounded how good he is at this, but acknowledges we need to put a stop to it.  So it is now put in his Education plan that adults cannot engage in negotiation with him as he is adept at contract formation and tricking adults into entering verbal contracts.  

TLDR: I taught my 2-3 year old contract law out of desperation to get him to go to bed.  When he got to school he used these skills to play adults. "
3,"TIFU by kicking a chestnut, stopping traffic for an hour and getting cornered by a lynch mob


So obligatory this happened yesterday but I’m still traumatised as I’ve never really encountered confrontation on such a big scale. 

So let me set the scene first. I live (and grew up) in a fairly densely populated city in Europe that has a good amount of nature patches. The people are genuinely quite friendly and usually not too short-tempered unless strangers (a.k.a non-locals) are involved. The location of this FU was a pretty busy junction just down the road of my flat - think two car lanes, cycling lanes, and pedestrian crossing. Anyway, it was just before rush hour, around 4 pm and the sun was grilling everyone in Europe (climate change - yeiy) for the past 3 weeks. 

I was strolling down the road towards the junction completely blanking my surrounding as I was trying to come up with the perfect dish to surprise my gf in the evening. Picture that quiet guy just minding his own business, head down, focusing on every single step - yep that’s me. Suddenly, I bump my head into a rock - or so I initially thought. I look up. It was the largest man I’ve ever seen - about the size of the mountain from GOT. He looked like a bodybuilder on steroids with a side of extra muscle (let’s call him ARNIE). I was startled for a second before I see his buddy (let’s call him SLY) who was quite a bit shorter but just as wide as he was tall - so still quite intimidating for an under-the-radar-guy like me. “Oi, watch where you are going” I bellow (jk, obviously Arnie did). So being super alpha and dominant I mumble “Sorry” and move around them to continue my walk to the supermarket. “I mean how the f\*\*\* was I meant to walk past them when they literally block the whole pavement standing next to each other.” I think and kick a chestnut out of frustration - metaphorically releasing and passing on all my problems. And oh boy that worked - somewhat. What happened next I could not have imagined in a thousand lifetimes. Hey, I mean even with the current AI technology I doubt they would have been able to predict that outcome.

I see the chestnut flying Roberto Carlos style towards the junction (hell, I heard the crowd roaring) and IMO it probably even broke the sound barrier. While the chestnut was still in flight I raise my hand in pride having reclaimed my manliness with this superb treasure of a shot. And I’m talking the eager-please-pick-me-keen-bean-Susan from middle-school hand raise (no, Susan mayonnaise is not an instrument). 

Suddenly everything kept coming down. 

The chestnut flew past a motorcyclist (around 3 feet high) who must have registered some kind of movement in front of him and he immediately hit the break. Remember how I said they had nature patches in the city? Well, the city installed sprinklers to keep the grass hydrated and green, but they somehow have their own spirit and love releasing water into the most inconvenient directions. 

You guessed it, despite almost 40°C there was a puddle the size of a small American town right there in front of the breaking motorcyclist. His breaking turns into sliding, into rotating, into falling and finally into that metal-to-asphalt-screeching halting. Behind him, a red car doesn’t manage to break in time but does a Fast and the Furious drift and slides past the motorcycle also coming to a halt in the middle of the crossing around 5 meters away from the motorcyclist. Then my attention is caught by the opposing lane as the red car just cut off a blue car’s path who does the same drift (thanks to the puddle) and ends up head-on with the bumper wrapped around the traffic light post. By a miracle of God (or chance for the atheists) the post was harder than a dick after a two-week dry period and withstood the incident without giving in. Yet the ten or so pedestrians waiting behind it scattered away with two stumbling over each other and falling flat faced. What followed after this was the loudest concert of honking cars and screaming, followed by screeching breaks from all directions. 

And then a split second of silence. 

Until I hear a majestic roaring that Simba would be proud of: “DUUUUUUUDE, WHAT THE FUCK!!!”, yup Arnie and Sly walk up behind me and instantly get the attention of about another ten surrounding pedestrians that just at that moment exited the supermarket next to me. They start to explain what they saw to the others ('me causing this accident on purpose and celebrating') and suddenly an elderly man (let’s call him Miyagi) grabbed my wrist with the iron grip of a Cyberman. 

At that moment my life flashed in front of my eyes. My future, my spotless criminal record, my clumsy soap handling skills and my virgin butt hole. I was not going to make it a single night in prison. 

Suddenly the commotion starts - picture a Real Madrid vs Barcelona team vs. team fight - all traffic stops, everyone gets out of their cars and comes towards our little ensemble - shouting. I’ve never seen a crowd agree that fast on anything but within 30 seconds everyone was pointing at me with red faces, anger in their eyes and most of them looked like they were going to release their Super Saiyan form on me while I was still trying to flee Miyagi’s claws (I know, statistically not all of them could have been Super Saiyans but still). What I haven’t mentioned yet is that I actually look fairly mixed-race and live in a very white neighbourhood - so within another 30 seconds many of the screams were more racist than incident related (immigration and progressive Europe - yeiy). Throughout I just kept silent and head down as about thirty people by now were surrounding me (still triangled by Arnie, Sly, and Miyagi) so that my voice would have drowned anyway. 

After about another 5 minutes which felt like an eternity the golden opportunity arrived. I think Sly took some pity with me and signaled a countdown with his left hand so only I could see and pointed into his direction. I am no fighter but I took one class of Wing Chun back in high school and in a spark of genius it all came back to me that moment. ’trap the dragon’s head, the tail bites - trap the tail, the head bites’. As Sly got down to his last finger I do the Kung Fu twist with my arm, break Miyagi's iron grip around my wrist and start dashing towards Sly. For a split second I thought I’d run into a muscle wall for the second time this day but in the last moment, he moved his 300 lbs. out of a way with the swiftness of a ballerina (damn, I was impressed). And then the sprint of a lifetime started. I was Powell, Bolt, and Blake at the same time. I ran like my butthole depended on it (well it kinda did). Luckily the mob never bothered to stand behind Arnie and Sly cause they figured I’d never get past them, so I didn’t actually have to tackle anyone on my escape (no potential assault charges - yeiy) and continued down the road. I see some people follow me (pretty sure they had no clue about the chestnut but they just thought I was somehow involved) so I kept running and I had a good 100 m head start. I was just in front of my apartment block when I had the second spark of genius of the day - there was no way I would show them where I lived, so I ran for another 10 min further than any man has run ever before (about 2 km) until I reached a park to lie down. I was pretty sure that I lost most people when I passed my flat (thank god for the heat) but I had to be sure. 

I cool down and call my neighbour who’s flat looks down on the junction. I told her the whole story (she’s a super old family friend) and she couldn’t believe I was the guy sprinting away (she was sunning on her terrace). Turns out the motorcyclist got up without injury and the blue and red car drivers weren’t harmed either. According to my neighbour the cops and ambulance were called and they took down the details of all drivers, moved the blue car and treated the two pedestrians for about an hour, while all traffic was stopped.

Something I didn’t realise from my POV was that a second mob formed simultaneously around the motorcyclist after the crash who blamed him for everything, cause it looked like he just couldn’t drive… and guess what - he was a foreigner - so that box was checked. His insurance will probably cover everything (at least that's what my conscience tells me).

I haven’t left my flat of fear being recognised at the supermarket, my gf was a bit pissed that I made frozen pizza, and I promised myself to never kick a chestnut again. 

tl:dr kicked a chestnut, distracted a motorcyclist, got out of hand and caused a crash, got blamed by a lot of clueless people, escaped running"
4,"TIFU by having the FBI pull me out of class


Obligatory *""this happened a few months ago.""*

This was easily the most stressful roller-coaster of an event that I hope I ever experience. 

The scene is freshman year of college. I'm a wide-eyed innocent student having a great time away from his parents. I've made some good friends and enjoy messing with them. As such, I decide to pull a little prank on them. It starts with a simple idea: I'm going to Ohio on a business trip. I was actually going to lunch with my parents, but this was a more fun story. I hadn't initially thought out this entire prank, but just like high school presentations, I decided to wing it. Every so often I would go on these out-of-state ""business"" trips, but I stayed vague as to what my business was. I told them that it was somewhat illegal, but in more of a gray area.

My friends were incredibly intrigued by my illicit endeavors, and as time went on, they began to ask more questions about this business. I still had little to no plan for this ordeal, but boy did I milk it. I had them convinced that there were overseas bank accounts with millions of dollars in them and that I had several people involved in this business. At one point I told them the story of how one of my employees got caught trespassing on government property and I had to pay $10,000 to bail him out. I would ""accidentally"" send a picture of several thousand dollars, claiming it was meant to go to someone else with no other explanation.

This went on for several months up until about April. The semester was coming to a close, and I had to figure out a finale for my little project. My roommates were in on my prank and several iterations of plans were discussed. The final version of this ~~bad idea~~ plan was as follows: I will create an email address posing as the chief of police at my college. In the email, the officer (we'll call him Bill Myers) will inform my friends that he is currently looking to bring in ShortTail359 for questioning. I was very specific to say that no one should call 911 or contact anybody outside of this email address with the excuse that there was no official investigation so Bill was looking into the matter himself. I then went on to explain how ShortTail359 is conducting a business out of university housing and that this is all we know but the business might be illegal/dangerous. In summation: email me if you know of ShortTail359's whereabouts, don't call 911, don't contact anyone else in the police department.

I figured I covered my bases and sent the email. It was very well worded and quite convincing to a group of people who already believed I was running a secret business. Sure enough, my friends bought it hook line and sinker. One of them replied, informing Bill that she didn't know anything about my business, other than that I mentioned it occasionally. Three friends ignored the email altogether, and one texted me saying she didn't believe it.

The next three days were interesting. I had several classes with these people and finals were upon us so skipping class was not a good idea, but I had to make them believe I was on the run. Fortunately some of these classes had several hundred students and I was able to sit far away from our usual spots. The smaller classes I avoided altogether. Meals were eaten at odd times, and at one point I had to hide in the shower because a friend was in my dorm. I had no contact with the prank-ees outside the occasional text.

Fast forward to the Thursday I decided would be the day to reveal my shenanigans. I'm walking into class when these two men in suits stop me just inside the door. They ask me if I am ShortTail359 and upon confirming this they tell me they need to speak with me outside. We walk downstairs to the building's lobby where I am greeted by two more men who have guns at their sides. All four of them hold up their badges in dramatic fashion and one introduces himself as ""Agent Michael Scarn with the FBI"" (fake name obviously). It was approximately at this point that I peed a little bit as I realized that I was in some trouble.

Agent Scarn: ""Do you know why we're here?""

ShortTail359: ""No, but I have a pretty good guess.""

Agent Scarn: ""Well why don't you tell us what your guess is?""

I proceeded to explain the email I sent out along with a brief summary of the genesis of my prank. 50 minutes of questioning later and I had given Agent Scarn the password to the email account, signed an agreement saying I won't access the account or I'd face several charges, given a written statement of the events, crapped my pants twice, and completely missed my class. Agent Scarn gave me his business card and said they would be in touch.

I go back to my dorm and try to come to terms with the fact that I may have ruined my future career and life altogether. All my friends had a good laugh at my expense but not before I had a good laugh at their expense for believing my stupid business story. After a long sleepless weekend I get a call from a Sargent at the police station. He says that he needs to meet with me and we arrange a time. I go down to the station and for 10 minutes all he does is yell at me and tell me what a stupid idea this was. Now I'm a pretty good kid. Never got in trouble in school, honor roll, never so much as a speeding ticket, so having a police officer yell at me was a new experience. He finally calms down enough for me to explain that this is an anomale and that it was supposed to be an innocent prank. He believes me and tells me that regardless, they're going to charge me with criminal impersonation which is a class A misdemeanor. My court date is set for a couple weeks from now and that was the end of it.

I go to court fully prepared to leave with a no longer perfect record. As the staff is processing me and taking my mugshot, a lady asks me what my name is. I tell her ShortTail359, when a guy jumps around the corner and yells ""But you can just call him Chief Bill Myers!"" This was a much needed laugh and also informed me that word of my idiocy had gotten around town. I go into the court room and waited for this lighthearted judge to call my name. Most of the charges were speeding tickets or marijuana related so the judge was moving pretty quickly. However, he calls my name and then pauses. I walk up to the podium and he's still paused, clearly reading over my file. He looks up at me, and then back down at my file again. After reading it completely through, he just starts laughing. Several minutes go by before he finally asks me if I have any sort of criminal history. I tell him I don't have so much as a speeding ticket and he asks if I would like to keep it that way. I happily say yes and he give the DA my paperwork. The DA asks for my story and tells me that he's never seen anything like this before (something I had heard several times at this point). He informs me that this is something they could have expunged as long as I pay my court fees. I thank him and go back to waiting for the judge to call me up again.

When he does, a smile immediately dawns his face and he begins to chuckle. At this point I'm relieved enough to let out a giggle of my own since I can feel the entire court room wondering what I've done. The judge tells me that he will expunge my charge and asks me if I will ever do something like this again. I assure him that I will not and he says, with a smile on his face, ""You know son everyone in this court room is wondering who you impersonated, but I'm going to do something that you should have done and keep my mouth shut."" I thank him and sheepishly walk out of the room.

Later that day I took the required documents back to the court and had the whole charge expunged in a matter of hours. It was easily the most stressful month of my life and was not worth it at all, but I am now able to walk around with an FBI agent's card in my wallet and keep a fond memory of being laughed at by a judge.

TL;DR: I play a prank on my friends that ends with me being questioned by 4 FBI agents for almost an hour and charged with criminal impersonation."
5,"TIFU by not knowing how much meat to order at the deli


This fuck up did happen today. For context I am a 23 year old student who still lives at home and isnt very good at being an adult. 

Today i went to the grocery store to buy some convenient things to make for lunch, since i work a summer job trying to pay for school. Usually i go grocery shopping with my dad, and when i went by myself today, i tried to pick out things that would also be good for him to bring to work.

I thought deli meat would be perfectly, but i didnt want to buy the already packaged meat because i heard that the fresh deli cut is slightly healthier? I dont know. But ive never ordered myself from the counter and i dont really pay attention when my dad does it so i try to remember 

""Dad usually orders....a pound..maybe? But that doesnt seem the last very long in our house.."" so i decide that it's logical to order 2 pounds of sliced ham. 

The lady sliced and sliced and sliced and finally she hands be a big, heavy fat bag of stacked meat with a price sticker of $13 dollars slapped on it, and i think to myself ""that's a lot of ham..."". Then the lady says

""I'm gonna put the other pound in another bag""  and i think ""FUCK thats a lot of ham"" 

So i spent nearly 30 dollars on ham today. Which sucks when youre a student working a summer job to pay for school. I now think my dad probably orders half a pound or something. I dont want my parents to see what ive done, ive learned my lesson. So im gonna try and gift it someone idk. 

TL;DR didnt know how much meat to order at the deli. Ended up ordering 2 pounds thinking i was being logical. Spent 30 dollars on sliced ham. "
6,"TIFU by ruining my promotion and having to quit my job out of shame


So I work, or rather used to work, for the Eastern European branch of a Dutch company. This was my first and only job for the last 4 years. I've invested all of my time and effort in this job, and eventually it did paid off, when at the beginning of the year the regional manager informed me they were planning to make me a team leader. This would have meant, that in addition to a 35% salary increase off the bat, I would also get a percentage of the profits my team made, which could have meant anywhere between 3 and 5 times my salary. I was about to become rich and nothing would stop me. I passed all the examinations, all the interviews, and for the past 6 months I've been doing overtime like there was no tomorrow. 

There was just one last step: I would have to do a presentation of my achievements and my vision for the future of the company in front of the man himself - the CEO of the company. My boss assured me this was more or less a formality and basically no one who was ever proposed for this promotion failed at this final step. 

This should have taken place today, at 9 a.m. Tomorrow, I should have been in the HR office, signing my new contract. Instead, tomorrow I will be signing my resignation. How did this happen? Well, being the loud mouth that I am, I basically bragged to everyone I know that I was about to become a boss. Yesterday evening, I wake up with three of my former college mates, with sever six-packs of beer and a generous amount of weed. Something inside of me was screaming this wasn't a good idea, but the other side was saying, hey it's okay to celebrate, you deserve it. I initially said I would only drink one beer and take a couple off puffs from a joint, but of course, at 4 a.m. I was still awake and smashed. 

I went to sleep, set my alarm for 7 a.m. and it did wake me up, but of course, being still very much smashed, I said just another ten minutes. I close my eyes, and after what didn't feel like more than 5 minutes, I wake up again, this time feeling better, but I could tell something was not right. I look at my phone, it's 9:30 a.m. and 5 missed calls. An intense feeling of panic hits me, I go straight into the shower, cursing non stop. I barely wipe myself, get dressed, make a dash for my car, drive like a mad man, passing several red lights (one of which I know for sure has red light camera), reach work in record time (7 minutes, it normally takes me at least 20). 

When I got there, I went straight for the conference room, which, unsurprisingly, was empty. I go for the office, and just as I was about to go in, one of the team leaders comes out. It happened to be exactly the guy I never got along with. He instantly gets a grin on his face and says, as loudly as possible, ""oh boy, look who's here, buddy you're in big trouble, go inside"". I get inside, I see my team leader working on his computer, the CEO is nowhere in sight. He throws me a look of utter disgust, one I've never seen before, and tells me ""take a seat, don't turn on your computer, we will go talk"". Now the entire office just looks at me like I've murdered someone, no one dares say a single word. After what felt like an eternity, my team leader gets up from his seat and without saying a single word, signals me to follow him. 

We go into the conference room. As soon as he closes the door, he goes into the most violent rage ever, screaming at me for what felt like hours, at one point I even felt like he was about to beat the shit out of me. Eventually, he did calm down, and told me - ""look, I'm not going to fire you, because you are the most competent guy on my team, but you have to understand that it's gonna take years, maybe even a new CEO, before you can be considered for this position again"". A moment of silence followed as I gathered myself back together and considered my options, when I eventually said ""Look, I'm sorry, I know I fucked up badly and I can't go on like this. I quit"". His last words were ""look, in other circumstances, I would have persuaded you to stay, and even now, if I could somehow get you out of this, I would, but it's beyond me now. If you wanna quit, I can't stop you. Good luck."" He then shook my hand and left. Now, I'm at the local McDonald's, already blew through half a pack of cigarettes while writing this post. I'm just thinking about what a idiot I am that I managed to ruin 4 years of hard work just by being an idiot one night.

Tl;dr I was supposed to have a final meeting with the company CEO before a huge promotion, I slept in, I lost the promotion and quit my job out of shame. "
7,"TIFU putting a half million dollar order of spicy mayo


This happened an hour ago sadly, I work as a delivery driver for a Japanese resteraunt and it was really slow. Me and a coworker who im cool with were talking about messing around on the computers we use to take orders, so i had previously tried making the most expensive order of filet mignon and we decided to see how high of a bill we could get. It started off at 100 dollars for a single plate, doing every customization possible and adding as much as we could to it. But then i had the fantastic idea of seeing what the highest we could get using the quantity function. We ended up putting $541,000 worth of spicy mayo and thought it was pretty funny. The phone rang and my coworker picks up the phone, and instead of pressing cancel, sent the order. I grabbed the recipt as quick as i could but the damage was done. Our computers couldn't handle roughly 1 million orders of spicy mayo and anytime we tried to open the order to delete it, it would crash. Our boss, who isnt the best at english noticed the commotion and saw the problem. We all tried fixing it but it was no use and he called support. It ended up getting fixed but my record of not making any mistakes was tarnished with my half a million dollar order of mayo. 

Tldr: i ordered $541,000 worth of spicy mayo on our work computer and ended up messing up our conputers"
8,"TIFU by fucking a lava lamp.


This fuck up happened about eight years ago, when I was in my mid teens.

I was a rather adventurous kid and learnt about masturbation at an early age. Obviously at that age I didn't have any ""aids"" to help me, so I would experiment with objects I would find around the house. It just so happened that my aunt had recently bought me some gifts back from her holiday, and one of them was a miniature lava lamp. Perfect dildo shape.

So, lava lamp in hand I jumped into bed and went about my business. Everything was great, it was my new favourite 'toy'. I fell asleep immediately after feeling happy and satisfied. This is where the fuck up begins.

And then I woke up the next morning and tried to pee. It felt like the contents of my bladder had been replaced with the fiery pits of Mordor. I figured that I just hadn't drank enough and made sure to drink a pint of water before I left for school, which was a fuck up in itself. I spent the rest of the day constantly needing the bathroom and not being able to pee properly, when I could it felt like I was pissing out tiny razor blades that were shredding up my insides.

Any sane person would have made an appointment with a doctor, but no, not me. I went on like this for some time, I think maybe 4-5 weeks. At this point I was in so much pain that I could barely move, but it was at the beginning of the summer holiday and I didn't want to spend it all inside a hospital, and I had a terrible fear of doctors. I told my mother that I just had stomach cramps and I must have ate something bad, but she wouldn't believe me and dragged my ass to the hospital.

It didn't take long for a doctor to come and see me and he started asking me questions about where the pain was. During this time I realised the pain had moved from my bladder to the middle of my stomach/back, but it was far worse on the right side, so I pointed this out to the doctor who promptly left the room and I was told I was being prepped for surgery because it sounded like I had appendicitis. Stupid teen me thought the infection in my bladder had spread there so just went along with the doctor and didn't say anything.

Several hours later and I wake up appendix-free but still in a lot of pain. Some people came to see me and told me that my appendix looked completely normal but they found traces of blood and infection in my urine sample and started me on an extra course of antibiotics.

I ended up spending 5 of the 6 weeks of summer break inside the hospital and still suffer from symptoms of my stupid mistake.

TL;DR: got a UTI from masturbating with a mini lava lamp because I forgot to pee after, ignored the symptoms for weeks and developed a kidney infection and ended up without an appendix.

Go to a doctor if it hurts when you pee. That was the real fuck up here."
9,"TIFU by being greedy and wanting more lasagna


This happened a few days ago. You know when you have weird cravings for bad food? Recently I was really into ready made, deep frozen lasagna from the grocery store. They come in small packages with one portion, you pop them in the oven, wait 30 minutes and done. On that particular day I was really hungry, so I got greedy and instead of one I heated two packages.

When the time was up I realised they wouldn't both fit on one plate, so I took my plastic cutting board to put them on and carry them over to my desk. First fuck up. I managed to drag the first package of lasagna onto the cutting board without problems, but the second one was stuck to the baking sheet. Desperatly trying to get it free with one hand and a fork, I rested the cutting board onto the baking tray, trying to get more leverage. It worked after a while and I lifted the cutting board up, noticing it had melted to the tray. Great.

At least I had my lasagna! But for some reason I really can't explain I wanted to see how damaged my cutting board was. So I lifted it over my head to look underneath. Second fuck up. I must have tilted it, because one of the lasagnas slid down, splattered onto the ground and covered my feet with hot sauce. I was barefoot. It hurt. So instead of picking it up directly I went to wash my feet and inspect the damage. Only light burns, luckily.

Back to the lasagna on the ground, I noticed that it was still steaming hot, and I had no paper towels to pick it up. Thinking for a moment too long I finally got toilet paper to do the job, and after I got rid of the lasagna package and the sauce, I noticed my white kitchen floor was stained red from the tomate sauce. I waited too long, and it took extensive cleaning to get rid of it again, that's fuck up number three.

Nothing I could really do, and I still had one lasagna left, I put a knife and my fork onto the cutting board, carried it to my desk and sat down to eat. The board was a bit too big for my desk, and the end was standing over the edge. Guess what happened? I pushed it with my arm, the lasagna started sliding, in panic I reached for it, threw the knife down which landed on my leg with the pointy end down and cut me, fml. 

TL;DR: Being greedy and making the double portion of deep frozen lasagna I managed to melt a cutting board, burn myself with hot sauce, ruin my kitchen floor and getting cut in the leg by a falling knife. In the end there wasn't much damage, but I am not making lasagna again."
