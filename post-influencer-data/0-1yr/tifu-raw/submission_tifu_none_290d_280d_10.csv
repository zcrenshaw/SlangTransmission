0,"TIFU by not putting away my sex toys


This just hit me.. I am slightly mortified. My heart is racing as I type this....

I had cleaned my toys and wrapped them inconspicuously in a washcloth, leaving them in the bathroom drawer. My relatives came to town and I forgot about it. After being away from home for a few days, I go to get a fresh towel to take a shower. What I see upon opening the drawer, makes my body react in such a way that you would think I have seen something truly horrifying. My washcloth burrito is unraveled, the contents on display. It is clear someone has discovered my secret(s). I am grateful to have dicovered this monstrosity of embarrassment after the guests are gone. Not sure how I will ever look them in the eye...

TLDR: I did not put my sex toys away and my family saw."
1,"TIFU by not realizing that a six year old in my Mandarin class thought I was male


Hey guys! I have to make this short and sweet, so here I go. Today i was in my normal Mandarin class, when a six year old, who we will call “Ryan”, had to go to the bathroom. I am significantly older, still underage of course, but noticeably older than him. I have short hair, and today I wore a baggy sweatshirt. I was being nice and volunteered to take Ryan to the bathroom, thinking that I would only take him to the door and wait out there. NOPE! He drags me into the bathroom where he (luckily) uses a stall to go number 2. After a while a person walks in, so I curl in my chest and puff up my shoulders, and when I make eye contact with the dude who came in, i mouth the word “Sorry about him” because Ryan is now audibly grunting. The dude sorta laughs and goes to use the urinal, and there isnt anywhere for me to hide. So I just sorta stand there and look away, but the facade worked because he was very nonchalant and said bye when he left. So eventually Ryan finishes up, and when I leave the bathroom, my two male friends are just standing in shock when I leave the bathroom. After realizing, one falls over and the other screams. 
Now I have to go with Ryan to the bathroom every day because I’m his favorite. 

Tl;DR I let a six year old think I was male and had to go into the bathroom with him, and now I have to go every time he wants to because “I’m his favorite”"
2,"TIFU by giving a bald guy his comb


I was travelling on the road and stopped at one of those rest areas in upstate NY. I head in to on the huge bathrooms to take a leak

The bathroom is huge and empty, so I just pick any random urinal without having to worry about saying no homo, or things getting awkward.

While doing my buisness, a guy I was unaware of left a stall. I was caught a bit by suprise since i thought I was alone.

I finish up and head to wash my hands. Just as he's leaving the restroom. That's when i notice a hair comb on the counter. I immediately call for the man right before he left, ""hey mister I think you left your comb!""

That's when I get my first good look at him, he's completely bald

TLDR: in an effort of being nice I remind a bald man that he left his comb."
3,"TIFU by spraying tea on a 7 year old kid


This actually happened yesterday. Also on mobile. 

So this all started when I decided to do a bit of studying at the library with some friends. The library closes early on the weekend, 5:00 pm, so we decided to grab dinner at the local supermarket, which has a seating area to eat 

Now since I'm a broke student, my go to dinner menu for these occasions would be a bowl of instant ramen and a can of Arizona. We got to the seating area and it was pretty empty, with just a 7 year old kid reading some magazine, probably waiting for his parents. My party decides to sit at the table behind the kid, since it was father from the washroom, which was being cleaned. Cue the FU.

As I get to my seat, the Arizona can I'm holding lightly bumps on the edge of a metal chair. This somehow creates a small cut in the bottom of the can. Now, if you know how shotgunning a beer works, these cans are slightly pressurized, and if a small incision is made, liquid starts spraying out like a garden hose on steroids. At first I'm in shock, so I'm just holding it directly at my friend, thoroughly covering him in ice tea. When I decide to do something, I'm turning left and right trying to figure out what to do, whilst pissing all over the food court.

Some of the tea got onto the kid sitting across from us, and he starts using his magazine as an umbrella, as he's frantically trying to figure out ""why it's raining inside"" or ""is there a leak in the roof"". 

Anyways, he leaves all sticky and we just try and ignore everything that happened.

Tl:dr sprayed ice tea over some kid, causing him to question reality."
4,"TIFU by buying the wrong body lotion


Background: when I first discovered masturbation, I used to steal this lotion from my older brother, he used to have one specific lotion, and between the ages of 13-16 I strictly masturbated using that lotion.

Yesterday I bought a new lotion from the grocery shop,  apparently it was SAME lotion that I used to make sweeeeet love to myself 7 times a day with when i was a teenageer (had a completely different packaging) it was coconut-y with a hint of vanilla, just thinking about the smell is making shift in my chair.

So today, whenever I had my hand anywhere near my face the entire day, I would take a slight whiff, and my body will just go “YEA LETS GO” followed by getting a raging boner.

Thank goodness for the ol’ tuck under the belt technique.
Awkward day.

TL;DR : used lotion that i jerked off over 5000 times with as a teenager, smell give boner"
5,"TIFU by getting overly creative with my masturbation at work.


So first things first, this wasn’t today. In fact it wasn’t even this week, month or year. I’ll take you back to my first job as a fresh faced lad of 16 (hence the masturbation at work), 12 years ago. 

I was working in a five star spa, part of one of the top hotels in the country. My job was to maintain the general cleanliness of the place, ensuring there were towels where there were meant to be towels and all the guests were happy. 

The ‘valet HQ’ was a room off of the men’s changing rooms. It was full of towels, robes, slippers and all of the other bits and pieces required to keep the place ship-shape. This was the place where we’d all sit and hang out when the place wasn’t busy, which was a lot of the time. 

I was alone one day working one of the quieter shifts of the week and there had barely been a guest all day. I’d been sat on a pile of clean towels reading a book for most of the morning and thought I’d do something else to pass the time. Being a bored, hormonal teenager it didn’t take me long to come up with a new way to kill time. 

I went and locked the door to the room. Nobody wants to be caught having a wank, least of all by your colleagues. I sat back down on the towels and got my chap out ready to do the dirty, and it was at this moment my plan came to mind. 

Rather than opting for a run of the mill tug I looked for ways to spice it up a bit. The room was full of exotic lotions and moisturisers, perfect for the task at hand. There was also a large number of magazines, though not of the variety usually employed as a wanking aid. I  came up with the idea of rolling it up into a tube, lubricating the inner with a squirt of moisturiser and going to town in the slick, wet hole I’d created. 

It was enjoyable, though certainly nothing to write home about. 

Job done I unwrapped my piece with a degree of self loathing and shame reserved only for moments like these. To compound my shame was the horror in the discovery of my error. 

My penis was jet black. 

I immediately recognised the error of my ways. The magazine was glossy. The moisturiser was wet. The ink ran and coated my penis with a tabloid magazines entire front pages’ worth of ink. 

I wasn’t sure whether I was at risk of suffering from ink poisoning of the dick, and thought better than to chance it by waiting several hours until my shift had ended and I was at home. I waddled to the only taps available to me, in the men’s toilets. Unfortunately I did not have access to any staff toilets so I had to clean myself as fast as possible, hunched over the sink praying that no guests walked in. 

Fortunately I got away with it. My fuck up could have been worse and I could have been faced with the prospect of explaining myself to a member of the public or my boss. 

TL;DR. Used a glossy magazine and some moisturiser to make a masturbation tool and painted my knob black. At work. "
6,"TIFU by asking out a person who was gay (oops) I


(FYI nothing against the girl or LGBT peeps in General still love y’all) 

So in the UK we have this thing called National citizen Service and in it we to do some things like adventure training, learning life skills and helping out the community. Anyways so I met this call who I’ll keep unnamed and for this whole course in the space of like 4 weeks I’d really wanted to ask her out. 

So after telling a lot of friends and getting a helpful nudge (I am very shy and am terrified of asking girls out). I got the courage to ask her if she wanted to get some coffee sometime and she said ok (stick with me here). I was very glad and a little shocked she said yes. 

Cue to a week later and we sorted out a day to meet-up. I was still kinda uneasy since I’ve never been on a date before and was really anxious about something happening to ruin it. And sure enough a day before we were supposed to meet up she texted me saying she didn’t realise it was romantic, and I quote “I only chase after that girl booty” I was again very shocked. She was really nice about it but it was still a little disheartening because I really liked her but I mean it’s not like I can do anything about it (no matter what Mike Pence thinks) 

We’re still in contact and it’s pretty funny so I don’t mind. But yeah anyone had a similar experience? 😂 Would be comforting 

TL;DR : I ask out a girl who I though who was into peen and turn out she into puss"

8,"TIFU by heating my friend's food up for him, weeks in advance


(This was many years ago, mind you, when I was very young)

My family had put together a party the day before, and one of the invited was a friend of mine. He has, to this day, allergies to a large range of things, so he had brought special food for himself.

The day in question, brilliant and helpful little me had decided he wanted to heat up his friend's food, even though I had no idea when I'd see him again 😂. My method of choice was the microwave. Little me didn't know that aluminum foil, which his food was wrapped in, would almost destroy his family's microwave and well-being. So, I placed (very much in advance) the food in the microwave only to be greeted by weird buzzing and sparking. I panicked, shut down the microwave, and ran to my parents. They thought it was humorous, but also gave me a warning not to do such a thing again.

TL;DR, (as a child) placed, well in advance, a friend's meal (which was wrapped in aluminum foil) in the microwave, and learned that you can't put metallic things in it. 😂"

10,"TIFU by spoiling game of thrones


Yesterday's  fuck up, actually, but I was at lunch with coworkers and one of them  was discussing how they want to start a new conspiracy theory because  their goal in life is to spread as much misinformation as possible (he  was joking, obviously). When asked why he backed up his response with  ""Chaos is a ladder"" so I immediately fired back ""Yeah, well he's dead  now!"" Another coworker has recently started Game of Thrones and loves  it. She definitely connected ""character death"" to the phrase ""Chaos is a  ladder"" so when she gets there, immediate spoil. She also told another coworker that I spoiled it for her in the future, and today I got a text that read ""Don't ever talk to xx again""

tl;dr spoiled a character death in GoT to someone who hasn't gotten there yet"
