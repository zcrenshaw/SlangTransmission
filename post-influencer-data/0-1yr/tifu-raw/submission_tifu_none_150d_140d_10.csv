0,"TIFU by trying to send my friend (m) a screenshot of this subreddit, but sent my tits in a pentagram harness instead


This literally just happened. I was discussing this subreddit with a guy (we’ll call him M) I’m flirting with... and we come across the hot sauce story, felt like it sounded like our mutual friend (he can be called B)

So I take a screenshot and go to send it on FB messenger.... muscle memory kicks in and I send the photo so quick my camera roll hadn’t updated... I accidentally sent a nude I’d taken half hour earlier. 

This wouldn’t be an issue usually... but this guy is like a brother figure. He’s not answering his phone so I’ve just spammed the fuck out of the conversation to stop it popping up.

All the while I’m on the phone to M, the initial intended recipient....who is also in a band with B. 


For anyone curious here’s me [trying to claw it back](https://imgur.com/gallery/888ILDh)

TLDR; tried to send a screenshot to a friend. Sent my tits instead.  Ughhhhhhhhhhh"
1,"TIFU by stumbling on my 19 y/o sons reddit and reading through it.


Dear lord. On my main account i came across a comment on a post in an ask men sub, it seemed vaguely familiar, so I clicked the user name and looked through the profile.  I click on profiles all the time if a comment seems familiar, or interesting...

This is my sons account. It has to be. The comment he posted is about something that happened while I was there. He had a more detailed post about that specific day. He had another previous post about an event in his life I knew about and knew some details about. He had a few other posts which I also read. 

I now know what gets him going sexually. Not something I needed to know.

I know what his girlfriend likes sexually. Also, not something I needed to know. Also quite surprising. 

I know how embarrassed he felt about an emotional time he had somewhat recently with my wife. I feel kind of heart broken for him about that one.

I know that when he was 17 he snooped in mine and my wife’s room, and came across out ‘treasure chest’.  Which included pictures of my wife and I...I feel kind of pissed about that one.

In reading through the comments he’s made to others, I’ve learned that he is wise beyond his years and an incredibly kind human. I feel very proud about that.

Overall, I wish I never clicked that first comment. I know waaaay more about his sex life than a father should.

TL;DR. Accidentally discovered my son on reddit. Found out about his kinky sex life, some heart break, and that the little fucker has snooped through my room."
2,"TIFU by leaving a dildo on the table and ruining my sons life


This happened Saturday night into Sunday morning but my shame has subsided enough for me to write this out. Also no throwaway because whatever. 

We have a 12 yr old son. 

Saturday night after he went to bed, husband and I decided to get a little sexy time in. After quite a few drinks, we also decided to break out the “toy” box. Husband leaves the room with a few dildos and says he will be back. (He was putting new batteries in them, etc). He comes back, we do our thing and go to sleep. We wake up in the morning and our son comes into our room and says “what is that on the table?!”
...I immediately realized the FU. Husband did not so he asks “what is it?” 
Son: a purple banana (ps he’s 12 so he knew what it was) and he walks out of the room. 
Cue immediate shame/laughter. I wanted the floor to open up and swallow me. 

Side note. We did not use that particular “purple banana” that night-thank god. 

After we composed ourselves husband goes into sons room and says “what do you want for breakfast?” 
Son says “I lost my appetite” 

I’m still dying inside. I’m sure son is too.

TL;DR left a dildo on the table like a moron, son won’t ever be the same."
3,"TIFU by jerking off and forgetting my PetCam was faced directly at me


So I want to just say this is 100% true and 100% embarrassing. 


So I usually have Monday’s off and spend the day doing homework, tidying up, playing video games, and today... jerking off. I don’t usually feel inclined to do this however today I had the urge. It was about an hour before my girlfriend got home so I definitely had time. I go into my room and get into bed and start skimming thru Ol’ Faithful AKA Pornhub. 

I finally find a video worth B’ing my L to and get down to business. As I’m about to... ya know... I get an alert on my phone that my girlfriend had just accessed the PetCam we have in our room that’s on our dresser. (We got this PetCube camera for Christmas so we can watch our two dogs while we are at work/school/out.) I immediately stop, now knowing that my girlfriend just witnessed me jerking it mid-Monday so I text her “........” . She doesn’t answer for about 2 minutes and then I see that she’s calling me. 

Now we’ve been together 2.5 years so this isn’t like a make or break thing and I honestly thought that although it was slightly embarrassing, it was also pretty funny. So I answer the phone laughing, ready for this to be something we joke about for a long time to come. Unfortunately, I was sadly mistaken to this being “funny”. She tells me that her co-workers had asked about our dogs and she wanted to show them on our awesome PetCam! But instead of two cute dogs on our bed, it was just me with my shorts down at my ankles, going to town on myself! So needless to say I don’t think I’ll be invited to any of her work Christmas parties in the future.

TL;DR : Decided to crank it before my girlfriend got home and forgot my PetCam was faced directly at me. She wanted to show her co-workers our dogs and instead showed them me jerking it in our bed."
4,"TIFU by eating first and asking questions later


 

My fiance and I have been eating Keto for the last 3 months. She recently bought these ""butter bombs"" that you put in your coffee/hot tea that adds fat to your diet. I saw half of one on the countertop and decided to give it a go because I hadn't used one yet.

I proceeded to make my tea that has cacao butter, coconut oil, hemp seed, and a bunch of other stuff in it but this time adding in that butter bomb. I threw it in the blender and glugged it down. I thought it was weird that it didn't melt/blend/mix all the way but drank it none the less. It didn't taste terrible but it made the drink a weird consistency.

Smash cut to later in the evening when my fiance says to me as I'm watching TV, ""Hey have you seen the other half of the air freshener wax that was on the countertop?"" SMH. My fat ass thought it was food. I suppose I should go on amazon now and leave a review. 5 Stars, would eat again.

&amp;#x200B;

 TL;DR I ate air freshener wax thinking it was a keto ""fat bomb"" because I'm a fat ass."
5,"TIFU and my son ended up thinking Santa Clause was stealing penises.


So my wife comes home after picking our two youngest kids up from school. She opens the door and goes, “Did you say something about Santa Clause stealing penises?”

I reply, “I didn’t say any shit like that. I would NEVER ruin Christmas.”

Here’s how we got there:

I have two daughters and a son. My son was 3 or 4 at the time. He refused to wear clothes and ran around naked or in his underwear. My daughters weren’t having any of it and were like, “This is your department, old man. Do something.”

I tried to reason with my son and that just didn’t work. I was thinking that I needed something to use that he was afraid to lose. He’s a tiny kid. He’ll play with a cardboard box and be happy. 

That’s when he came running past me with both hands on his junk. That’s it. He loves his dick. I love MY dick. Me and my penis are tight. 

So my son and youngest daughter after eating lunch. I look across the table and go, “Hey big guy, you know how sometimes you can’t go to sleep cause you think there’s something in your closet?”

Hesitantly, “... yes.”

“I didn’t want to scare you but you’re old enough to know now.”

His eyes got wide and my daughter had a puzzled look on her face. She’s 4 years older. 

I go, “There’s a goblin that lives in your closet. And if you don’t do what you’re supposed to, like wear underwear and clothes, he creeps out at night while you’re asleep and steals your penis.”

He incredulously responds, “NAH AH.”

I reassure, “Oh yeah. What do you think happened to your mom and sisters?”

At this point my youngest daughter loses her mind laughing. She’s holding her sides and almost falls out of her seat. 

My son was dead silent. I could almost hear him thinking, “Damn... they don’t have dicks.”

So where does Santa Clause come in?

After I told my wife I would never ruin Christmas, she tells me she heard our son say to our daughter, “You must have done something really bad for Santa Clause to steal you penis.”

My guy confused Goblins with Santa somehow and thought Santa Clause was roaming around with a big red sack full of stolen dicks. 

Fear not. I straightened him out. I googled pics of Santa and pics of goblins from the movie Labyrinth. 

TLDR: Tried to scare my son into wearing under wear and he ended up thinking Santa Clause was stealing dicks."
6,"TIFU by not realizing cheese isn't supposed to hurt you


I guess this is three decades in the making but I only discovered it Saturday, so it feels like a very fresh FU.

This weekend I was eating a sandwich with some extra sharp parmigiano-reggiano cheese flakes on it and I made the comment over voice chat with my friends that it was so good but so sharp it was tearing up my mouth. I had a momentary pause before a chorus of puzzled friends chimed in at the same time to ask me to elaborate.

""You know, it's extra sharp. It really cuts and burns my gums and the roof of my mouth.""

And that's when my friends informed me that none of them have this reaction, and futhermore, *no one* has this reaction. I hear several keyboards going at once with people having alt-tabbed to google around and our best webmd-style guess is that I have an allergic reaction to some histamines common in sharp cheeses, and that I've had this reaction for *thirty years*, and that I always assumed *everyone* had it. 

""What the hell do you mean when you call it a *sharp* cheese if THAT'S not what you're talking about?!""

I figured the mild-sharp spectrum for cheeses was like the mild-hot spectrum for spicy foods. I love spicy foods. I love sharp cheeses. I thought they were the same kind of thing where they were supposed to hurt you a little bit. Apparently ""sharp"" just means ""flavorful"" or ""tangy.""

TL;DR: I have an allergy to some cheese protein and for 30 years I've been thinking that sharp cheese is supposed to sting."
7,"TIFU by catching my dad perving on my girlfriend in the shower


This happened this morning, and I'm not really sure how to react to it. I'm home from university at my parents' place for the Easter break, and my girlfriend is staying with me for a few days (not gonna lie to you, my girlfriend is pretty damn hot, I've done well for myself). We'd just had breakfast - my girlfriend went to shower, my mum went out and I was tidying the kitchen.

Our shower has a fairly old latch mechanism, and there's a hole at the top of the mechanism that you can see through if you try hard. Anyway my dad kind of disappeared upstairs whilst I was doing the kitchen, and I heard the hoover going outside the bathroom door - thought that was pretty weird as I hoovered the house yesterday and it was spotless. Looked up through the stairs and saw him kind of milling outside the bathroom, which made me very suspicious. So I went upstairs, and he acted as if tidying away the hoover, then disappeared off. I went back to carry on tidying the kitchen, decided to go and peer up through the stairs and again saw him kind of milling outside the bathroom. He doesn't know I'm there, but does this kind of brusque walk over to his bedroom, and just seconds later my girlfriend comes out of the shower to call me up as she can't get it to go cold. I put two and two together in my head - his brusque walk must have been because he saw her getting out the shower, and was peeping on her.

I sat upstairs in my room outside the bathroom for the rest of my girlfriend's shower, but I'm pretty shocked and don't really know how to process this. My dad is 63 and my girlfriend 22. I don't know whether to tell her what I saw, as I don't want her to start hating my parents. Equally I'm worried this is gonna make the Easter weekend awkward af. Help me Reddit.

TL;DR Thought I caught my 63 y/o dad peeping on my girlfriend in the shower. Gave him the benefit of the doubt, then he ran away from the bathroom just seconds before she opened the door, pretty much confirming my worst nightmare of what he was doing."
8,"TIFU by playing a Jackbox game with my girlfriend’s family


A little background: my girlfriend’s family is extremely conservative. Like goes-to-church-twice-every-Sunday-and-never-swears conservative. While they are really nice people, it’s a challenge for my heathen self to successfully endure a whole weekend with them without saying something that brings shame to my name. Onward...

So earlier tonight, my girlfriend’s family decided to play some games together. We settled on Drawful (a game that allows you to draw things from your phone). This is where things go south... 

After choosing our character names, you have to draw your character. Seems cool, right? However, this is my first time playing and everyone failed to mention that once you start drawing, YOU CAN’T ERASE. So being the funny guy I am, I draw this huge, veiny dick and secretly show it to my girlfriend in front of me. We have a good laugh because we both knew damn well that her family would be mortified if it showed up on the screen. As a joke, my girlfriend pretends to hit “submit,” on my phone. In reality, she REALLY DID HIT SUBMIT. Next thing I know, my character name pops up on the tv with a huge, contoured schlong. There was no mistaking this beauty, either. I feel my heart skip a beat. I looked around and immediately make eye contact with her 12-year-old sister, who looks at me with a disappointment unmatched by anything I’ve experience before.

I panic. I try to exit out of the game, but my Dick-asso masterpiece remains in the center of the screen. I stare at my phone to avoid the look from her parents. I try to pretend that I have no idea what happened. 

The game starts and every round, without fail, my pork sword drawing makes it way around the screen. I don’t say a single word. The room is uncomfortably silent. I hear the occasional giggle from my girlfriend, and I’m doing my best not to explode inside.

The game FINALLY ends after what feels like a year. I select the new character screen and her dad says, “What? You don’t want to keep your big penis on there? Jesus would be so proud on this Easter weekend.”

Safe to say my girlfriend (more her family) isn’t the one for me. 

TL;DR: I played Jackbox’s Drawful with my girlfriend’s family. I joking drew a huge dick as my character and my girlfriend accidentally submitted it. So there I was on the tv, identifiable as a veiny dick in front my girlfriend’s sheltered, conservative family..."
9,"TIFU by peeing in a girls mouth thinking i was ejaculating.


Me and this girl met up after ages of speaking on snapchat (about 6 months), with the whole intent to have sex. 

&amp;#x200B;

She gets to my house and we talk for a bit and things are going well, Things go to things and were kissing, then sex, you know the usual. After a few struggles of putting on a condom (never had used one before) i was able to fuck her and it went well. I came and threw the condom in the bin. 

&amp;#x200B;

This is where it gets fucked, shes sucking on my dick, i feel as if im about to cum again, thinking to myself thats kind of weird because i dont usually cum is such quick succession but i go along with it. I feel as if im about to do it and end up what i think is ejaculating in her mouth. I could not be anymore wrong.  


I ended up peeing in her mouth for a few seconds, she swallowed that, and then took my dick out thinking i was done, pee shot out of my dick on her boobs, she realised, i realised, i panicked so hard and immediately got her into my shower taking off the rest of her clothes.

&amp;#x200B;

Grabbed a towel and made her drink some mouthwash and gave her a glass of water, i was on my feet the whole time and she wasnt even making a big deal about it, i felt like utter shit

&amp;#x200B;

In the end she said the sex was good and that she heard about times her friends had that happen to her, told her i'd go to the toilet before fucking next time, and we are all good now.

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR - Thought i was ejaculating for a second time in a girls mouth, ended up peeing and she swallowed some."
10,"TIFU GF walked in on me soaking my willy in a glass of milk


I’m in the Navy, and about 4 years ago I was stationed in Cuba. I had a new girlfriend that I was trying to impress by cooking her dinner (even though I was a horrible cook).

I decided I was going to make some jalapeño poppers as a side dish, and foolishly decided to use my finger to scoop out the seeds before stuffing them with sour cream.

Once everything was prepared I popped them into the oven and decided to take a shower while I waited.

Naturally, being a guy I decided to have a wank in the shower. No harm no foul right? 

WRONG.

I felt the burn with every stroke, but I was so close to finishing I just...decided to bust a nut... and then I would figure out what to do next. (Yes, I know this is my own fault, I’m not proud of it okay?)

Unfortunately that 10 minutes of wanking only further cemented the juices from the jalapeños deeper into the skin of my penis. (Shocking I know).

The pain soon became unbearable, I was rushing around my barracks room butt naked desperately trying anything I could think of to alleviate the pain: washing my member off with a clean towel, putting ice cubes between my penis and my ballsack, standing in front of the fan, nothing was working. 

Then it dawned on me. I recalled hearing that milk can help alleviate the burn in someone’s mouth after eating spicy food.. and I knew this was my only hope.

I filled up a glass with ice cold milk, set it on the floor, and squatted down on top of it, dunking my bits into the heavenly, cooling liquid.

Instant relief. Thank God, I said to myself. There was only one problem, the moment I took my penis back out of the milk, the pain rushed back to my lions.

So I sat there, in a squatting position, my dick afloat in a glass of milk, and realized my blinds were wide open, on a sunny afternoon. Anyone could look in and see what was happening. But the pain was so bad that I couldn’t keep my dick out of the milk for more than a second or two.

I decided that the only solution was to lay on the ground, face down ass up, so that if I was to flash someone at least they would only see my ass cheeks and not my burning schlong.

I laid there for about 2 hours until my girlfriend came back from work, and found me in my miserable state. 

After a lot of laughter and about 10 minutes of explaining the situation, she asked me “why didn’t you just press the glass of milk into your body with one hand, so you could walk around and put some clothes on and stuff?

Needless to say, if I didn’t feel like an idiot before, I did then. 

Eventually a few hours later I went to the emergency room, where I was given a cream that barely worked, and I was excused from work the next day.

We are no longer dating, but I hope her thinking back on my embarrassing story puts a smile on her face now and then.

12,"TIFU by waking up to fap in the middle of the night


(Throwaway here for obvious reasons)

This happened last night and I am absolutely mortified.

So I'm on uni holidays visiting my family in Sweden and everyone's watching this Swedish comedy film. 

I've seen it before so i decide to go back to my room and watch something on my phone. Got bored, and ended up looking up some glorious girl-on-girl action on my phone with my earphones on (I'm a 23 year old guy, our demographic helps pay for Pornhub employees' children's educations).

One of our only two toilets (not close to my room, but relatively far from the living room) in the house is undergoing maintenance because of some plumbing issues. Obviously I'm not going to go choke my chicken in the one other toilet located near the living room with 3 other people (mom, dad and older sister) in the living room. So I decide to hold it, and wake up in the middle of the night to secure the deed to my peen, when they're all asleep in their respective rooms.

Ended up setting a relatively quiet alarm for 3am (I'm a light sleeper), and woke up excitedly (sue me) and loaded up some femdom stuff that I'd saved earlier on onto my phone, and grabbed my earphones from the table. I know my house inside out like the back of my hand, so I never turn on the hallway light at night if I ever need to go pee, so this sneaking around is quite easy on me. So, I put my earphones in and I start ""getting things going"" with my other hand.

When I get near the bathroom and look up - I don't know how long she was stood there for, or what - but I see my older sister just standing there, frozen in shock staring at me, with *her* phone in hand and earphones on as well (thankfully no hand in pants) seemingly on the way to the same toilet as well. We looked at each other for what seems like forever (probably like 5 seconds) before we both turned around and walked back to our rooms. Safe to say, my erection died faster than a campaign promise on election day then and there. 

Why or how she decided to wake up at that exact same time as me I will never know. I don't know if she was also attempting a Ménage à Moi I don't know and I don't want it ever confirmed either at this point.

We haven't said anything to each other all day so far today and we've been avoiding eye contact so far.

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR: Woke up to fap in the toilet at 3am with my phone in hand, earphones on and the other hand down my pants, to walk in on my sister on her way to the toilet with her phone in hand and earphones on as well. We both froze and slowly and awkwardly walked back to our rooms guiltily and now have been avoiding eye contact."

Obligatory this happened yesterday not today.

&amp;#x200B;

Added the NSFW Tag just to be sure...

&amp;#x200B;

I work at a fairly small company, full of programmers. We have the policy that, if you're tired and/or you're mentally exhausted, just do something else. In my case I usually read the news, play a quick game or read some interesting articles. Now, lately I got into the whole SCP universe (for those of you that don't know what that is: Its basically a collection of fan fiction about a foundation that secures and contains objects and phenomenons that are unexplained and/or dangerous). The SCPs are ordered numerically and I'd usually just google something like 'SCP 093', go to the page, read through it and go back to programming. Now our boss doesn't strictly monitor what we do online but if we search for something offensive and illegal, he will get a notice and usually addresses is fairly quickly. Now the fuck up: yesterday I casually searched for SCP 013 and didn't type in the S, searching for 'CP 013'. The algorithm noticed that and messaged my boss. At that moment, I didn't think about it, rewrote my search, read through the article and continued programming. So later that day, my boss would come up to me and ask me to speak to me in private. I go 'sure' and wasn't sure at all what I'm in for. He starts asking me (and mind you, me and my boss have an extremely good relation) if I wanted to tell him something and if I'm aware what's legal and illegal and so on. I was so confused for like 5 minutes, feeling his worried and somewhat angry face staring at me,  until he finally asked me, why I searched for 'CP 013'. I started to laugh and explained it to him. He laughed too and we sorted it all out, but for a couple minutes I thought my heart is going to jump out of my chest. He would proceed to tell the story to everyone at my office and we all had a good laugh out of it.

TL;DR accidentally searched for 'CP 013' and had to explain to my boss what I actually was searching for."
15,"TIFU by probably getting put on some police list for using wet wipes


This TIFU actually happened today much to everyone’s surprise.

I went fishing early in the morning with my father and we caught some glorious fishies. Anyone who’s been fishing knows the smell of bait and fish guts is not very pleasant and is extremely difficult to get the stench out of your hands. I whipped my hand sanitiser out and did the best I could but the smell was still there, but hey that’s what fishin’ is all about!

On the way home we stopped off at the supermarket to get a few supplies and I opted to wait in the car while my dad got the goods. So I’m just sitting there with smelly hands, bored as hell so I started looking in the car for literally anything to do. I found some wet wipes in the glovebox and immediately thought “Hey! I can use these to get the smell out of my hands” so I wiped my hands and looked at my phone and realised I could use this to clean my phone too after handling it while fishing (because seriously, who doesn’t take a photo of their catch, please it’s 2019 for goodness sake) aaaaaand this is where the fuck up begins.

I took out a wipe, put my phone on my lap and started furiously wiping the screen to get the stickyness off. About 30 seconds go by until I realise there’s a middle aged woman standing about 20 feet away from the car staring at me in shock... We made awkward eye contact and I continued to aggressively scrub my phone until she pulled out her phone, dialled a number and walked off looking disgusted.

It was only a few moments later when I realised that from outside of the car it looked like I was furiously masturbating while chilling in my car.

So to the lady who had he great pleasure of witnessing that, sorry if you thought I was jerkin my gherkin in broad daylight, in the middle of a shopping centre carpark and I hope you didn’t call the cops on me!

TL;DR cleaning my phone while in a car and it looked like I was jacking off, woman who walked by disgusted probably called the cops."
16,"TIFU by making a bad call


*Throwaway account because I'm already in the girlfriend's bad books over this.*

So, this shit happened yesterday afternoon. I was high as fuck and hard as a rock. I wasted no time ""getting into character"", picking up the phone and calling the girlfriend. This was how it went down:

Girlfriend: Yello... 

Me: tsk, tsk, tsk. 

Girlfriend: Chad? 

Me: It's ""sir"" to you. 

Girlfriend: What?

Me: I read your paper and it sucked. You're gonna have to come and see me in private, you know, so we can discuss the big fat D I intend to give thee.

Girlfriend: Um... wow (giggles). Can we talk later? 

Me: You wanna turn that D into an F? I have loads of Fs to give. I'm gonna cover my ink all over your paper. If you listen carefully, I'm already preparing the pen...

Oof. More than enough cringe, right? Wrong. You see, that was the moment I proceeded to fucking fap into the phone. Complete with man-moaning.

Girlfriend: Chad! Jeeezus! You're on loudspeaker. Like, everyone in the car can hear you. 

I froze mid-wank. 

Me:

Girlfriend: Well done on traumatizing my sisters.

Disgusted Sister: Fucking gross, Chad. 

Christian Sister: Virgins. Suuure. 

Hoe-ish Sister: How big is this pen, Chad? I mean, ""sir"".

*Crickets* 

Me: I should probably hang up...

I'm not sure how this happened. But somehow all the sisters began bickering over whose boyfriend fucked up the most or some shit. The crazy bitch came out in all of them. It got ugly. 

I hung up and fucking face-palmed. Even now, as I'm typing this, I'm still face-palming. 

**TL;DR I called the girlfriend, masturbated over the phone, and then came to realize she was not only one listening, which kind of sparked a sibling war.**"
17,"TIFU by feeding my boyfriend steak and getting him drunk at work.


Last Saturday, my ""boyfriend"" and I were to run an obstacle course. I asked my trainer what kind of food would be best to have before and after the race, and he suggested omelet for breakfast, and something with lots of protein for dinner.

Friday night I buy 2 thick and juicy ribeye steaks to cook for us Saturday night after the race. I remembered years ago I saw a Jack Daniels glaze in a restaurant, and think it would be a good idea to marinate my steaks in some whiskey. Not knowing exactly how that works, but knowing that with marinades, it's best to cover the whole surface of the meat, I pour half a bottle of Jack Daniels whiskey in a zip-lock bag, throw the steaks in, and make a note to take them out in the morning.

Saturday morning, we sleep through our alarm, and in our haste to rush to the race, I forget the steaks in the fridge. I think it's no big deal, I'll take them out after I get back, it will only have been 24h, surely that's not too bad. Problem is, I didn't plan to run the race myself, but when I get there, the BF is a little sad that he'd have to go it alone. So in the spirit of solidarity (and masochism) I sign up last minute to run with him.

Needless to say, by the time we got home, we were covered in mud, physically, mentally, and emotionally exhausted, and I was in no mood to cook anything. We decide instead to go out to eat, and I once again leave the steaks in the fridge overnight, thinking I can cook them for lunch tomorrow. 

Sunday rolls in, we begrudgingly roll out of bed at noon, and after a light breakfast we aren't that hungry, so we push lunch back a few hours. At around 6pm, 48 HOURS after the whiskey was introduced to the steaks, I remember I am supposed to cook them, so I get cracking. They cook nice and quickly (suspiciously quickly, in hindsight) but we still aren't too hungry, so I put a steak in a container with some potatoes for him to have for lunch the next day.

Monday at around 12:30 I get a video call from the BF. He looks flushed, a little woozy, and his eyes are darting all over the place. He tells me the steak had soaked up so much alcohol, he is actually quite drunk, he can't stop burping, and the whole office smells like whiskey. His boss walked by his desk and smelled the booze, and thankfully he has a sense of humor because he told him ""BF, it's not nice not to share"". 

He finished the call by telling me how pretty I looked, how pretty everything looks, pretty pretty pretty, and then got really serious and told me he is concerned for me, because I am a lightweight, and if I eat my steak, I will probably die of alcohol poisoning, so I should save it for him.

TL;DR I marinated my steaks in whiskey, left them in too long, fed them to boyfriend, he is now in AA."
18,"TIFU by giving myself an enema with my mouth (Extremely NSFW)


I’m an open minded person.

I’ve read these articles online making claims about the incredible, life changing sensation of an enema. About how they eliminate toxins, cure constipation, generally feel feel amazing and are essentially the answer to all life’s problems. Yesterday, being the person that I am, I decided that I wanted to experience these things for myself. 

The thing is, I don't have an enema kit. What I do have, however, is a plastic, roughly one foot-long bendy straw from a pair of straw glasses I got as a kid. You know those tube-glasses that you wear and when you drink something it goes through the straw and around your eyes? Part of those.

Oh well, I’m the master of jury-rigging makeshift versions of real products, and I was feeling particularly up to the task. Oh, what a mistake that was.

The plan was to connect one end of the tube to the front door, and the other end of the tube to the back door. I was to use my mouth as a reservoir of water that would soon travel through the tube and cleanse my asshole of its ungodly toxins. At about 4 o’clock in the afternoon, it was game time. 

The mission was to be completed over the toilet for obvious reasons, and I first began by inserting the tube into my anus. It wasn’t an easy task, but I was able to get it in there with only mild discomfort. I waddled over to the sink to top my mouth up with water. 

This was it. The better-than-orgasmic feeling described to me via the internet was soon to come, and I was prepared to never be the same again. And boy, was I. 

The two doors were finally connected via one foot of plastic bendy straw, and i began to build pressure. All of a sudden, the juices were flowing and the water was transferring from one end to the other. It was going well, the cooling sensation of the water was actually quite nice. But little did I know that my colon was far stronger than I had anticipated. 

I soon noticed immediate backlash as my colon compressed, sending brown gunk shooting up the tube at light speed. I noticed what was wrong right away and applied equal pressure from the mouth end. In front of my eyes I saw the two battling forces of light and dark, however it was simply not enough - my colon was victorious. Brown shitwater filled my mouth and I recoiled instinctively from the taste of feces. With nowhere else to go the human mud sprayed all over me and my bathroom floor, I spat and spat and spat but the stench of shit in my mouth would not leave. 

Tears streamed down my face as I washed my mouth out with soap repeatedly, traumatized, shaking, gagging. I cleaned up as best as I could and sat on my bed silently. I think I sat there for a long time. 

I think it’s right about now that I rethink all my life choices. I’m not quite sure what i expected, to be honest. But I think all those articles were right. I will never be the same - that’s for sure.

Tl;dr:

Heard about how great enemas are. Tried to jury-rig one using a straw and my mouth, turns out my colon was stronger and I ended up getting a mouthful of shitwater and being traumatized for life."
