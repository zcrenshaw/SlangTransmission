0,"TIFU by not washing under my foreskin for the first 15 years of my life


This is long so TLDR at the bottom.

This happened around 6 years ago when I was in 9th grade. I grew up not knowing a single thing about my dick or how to clean it. My parents never taught me anything about genitals and I apparently never asked, all I knew was that’s where the pee came out.

So one day in 9th grade biology our teacher was covering the male reproductive system that day and she got to a point where she mentioned that for uncircumcised makes the foreskin is supposed to retract over the head of the penis. I was pretty shocked because that’s certainly not how mine worked. By that time I was a daily meat beater and my foreskin could barely go back enough for me to see the entrance of the urethra!

So armed with my new knowledge about how my dick was *supposed* to work I went home and a few google searches led me to discover that I had a severe case of phimosis. So being the pragmatic young buck that I am I also google how to fix it. There were basically two options: either tell my parents and have them take me to a doctor for surgery or do stretching exercises. Not wanting to tell any of this to my parents or have someone come near my penis with a scalpel I opted for the latter option. I got some baby oil, the only lube available at the time other than my mom’s bottle of expensive extra virgin olive oil, and went to work.

After about 4 hours of stretching I finally started making some progress! I could see a slightly bigger area now, not just the opening of the urethra like before. Everything was going great except for 1 thing: from the underside of my foreskin came the most pungent, musty, cheesy disgusting smell I’ve ever had the displeasure of smelling even to this day. It dawned on me that my penis had truly not been cleaned at all in my entire life up to that point. I kept stretching over the course of a few days and I started to notice a thick, gooey greenish-brown sludge seeping from under the foreskin as I stretched. Some quick googling taught me that this was *smegma*, also known as Dick Cheese. 

I cleaned it off whenever it seeped out during my stretching exercises and as much as it disgusted me everything was still going fine. That was about to change real fucking fast.

So this was about 10 days into my stretching and I’d gotten my foreskin about to the half way mark. I was getting very excited to finally have a normal full functioning penis so I got very impatient and I decided I’d try to force it all the way back that day I lubed and got to work, I pulled it back as far as it would go and pulled it some more. I pulled it till I couldn’t bear the pain anymore. I did this over and over again for around 3 hours until I somehow managed to pull it almost to where it was almost over the entirety of the head of my penis. I got way too excited and despite the pain I gave it one big yank and I felt the foreskin pop over the back of the glans. It hurt like hell but I was just so relieved that I didn’t care. I opened my eyes and my heart skipped several beats. The entire lower half of the head of my penis down to the area behind it was caked with thick brown/green smegma. That was now mixing with the blood that was now seeming out of where I tore the top part of my foreskin when I yanked it over the glans. I freaked and squeezed the area to stop the bleeding and that only made the pain worse. It eventually stopped and then I had to chip away at the smegma caked unto my penis. I eventually got it all off after half an hour of scrubbing. I was still hurting but I was finally done. I got the foreskin all the way back over the head of my penis. I thought that was it. I tried rolling it back over the head but it wouldn’t budge so I just left it.I completely ignored the fact that the forcing the foreskin back all the way would constrict all the blood flow to the head of my penis. You know how a balloon looks when you fill it with water and tie it? That’s how my penis looked. I went to bed, went to school the next day in severe pain and acted like everything was fine.

When I got home I was still in major pain so I decided I’d check on it. I undressed in the shower and looked down at it. The first thing I saw were the blisters. Two huge brown puss filled blisters; one on the right side and the other on the underside of the glans. The next thing I noticed was the fact that my dick was now seemingly turning some shade of white. I’m a black guy.

I realized that if I didn’t find a way to get my foreskin back over my glans then it was probably going to shrivel up and fall off. I lubed up once more and began forcing my foreskin back over the glans. This was made even more difficult because of the two big blisters in the way. I kept trying to force it back over and I put too much pressure on one of the blisters and it broke causing pus to leak out all over my penis and fingers.  My penis was on fire at this point and I was holding back tears but I kept pushing until I felt it pop back over the glans. Judging from the liquid that seeped out afterwards and the extra jolt of pain I felt I guess the second blister popped too. Once again I left it and fucking went to bed. 

I checked 3 days later and my penis went back to its original color. I rolled back the foreskin again and cleaned where the blisters were and within 3 weeks I was pretty much ok. My foreskin was still tight and I do think constricting my glans with the opening of my foreskin for a whole day probably made me lose a tiny bit of sensation down there but hey at least my dick is clean!

Also please for the love of god teach your kids about their body. Even if they aren’t as stupid as I was don’t take that risk lol

TL;DR; had severe phimosis, did stretching exercises to fix it, forced it back because I got impatient, had to clean 15 years worth of smegma off my penis and ended up tearing my foreskin, couldn’t get it back over the glans cause it was too tight, left it there for a day, dick turned white and blistered due to the opening of the foreskin squeezing the area where the glans meets the shaft, forced it back over and popped both blisters in the process, most traumatic experience of my life.

1,"TIFU by accidentally asking my wife's sister for a three way.


This fuck up mainly involves three people me [M32], my wife [F27] and her sister [F25].

So for context a normal Saturday is for my wife and I is to drop our kids off at her mothers house and go back to ours for some ""good times"" and maybe a film, games or meal etc.

This week however is ""time of the month"" as she puts it so anything sexual is off. 

So off we go to drop off our kids, when we arrive we are greeted by her mother and by chance her sister who happens to be staying there over the weekend. 

Now obviously sisters talk and these two talk a lot so her sister knows what we normally do on our Saturdays.

As we are about to leave her sister says ""Have fun"" in a cheeky way which I completely don't pick up on.

My brain decides that as my wife and I spent Thursday together for Valentines and today we are just going to chillout, play some games and watch a film coupled with the fact they don't get to spend much time together anymore it would be a great idea to invight the sister along to chill out.

So straight after the ""Have fun"" and without consulting my wife, I say ""You can tag along if you like""

The atmosphere drops like a lead balloon and silence descends upon the scene and I'm still there like...   ""what?"" my brain still not connecting the dots  so I double up the fuck ups by breaking the silence with. ""As you said it will be fun"".

My wife's face turns from confused and embarrassed to that look she gives me when I've done something very very wrong and the sister just looks stunned!

Still didn't connect the dots until she explained in the car on the ride home.

I've apologised and explained. I know we will laugh about it later but for now I'm playing LEGO lotr on my own. 

TL:DR I asked my wife's sister for a three way without realising sisters talk about the things they do."
2,"TIFU by making a Redditor think I was a serial killer causing her to delete her account


*Note: This post mentions nudity and NSFW subreddits, but doesn't contain or link to anything NSFW.*

I waited a couple of years before posting this, but I think it's time.

I had just got done randomly browsing the internet where I'd come across some weird articles on how to make clothing out of plastic grocery bags. Things like [this](https://www.instructables.com/id/Dress-from-plastic-bags/) or [this](https://i.imgur.com/iUjMlFC.png). I remember thinking, ""Wow. How trashy."" and didn't think much else of it. Later that night, I was browsing some of Reddit's various GoneWild subs. If you are unfamiliar, those are subs where Redditors can post nudes of themselves. That's all you really need to know about it. Obviously, they are NSFW which is why I'm not linking to any of them. One girl in particular I found incredibly adorable and wrote her comment on her picture. I like to comment on GoneWild posts because complimenting the girls is a self-esteem boost for them and sometimes they reply and we have fun little conversations. It's an all around good time as long as you're respectful and aren't a creep about it. So anyhow, I go to comment on this girl's picture and I immediately flashback to the plastic bag clothing. I thought to myself, ""This girl is so adorably cute that I bet she could wear those plastic bag dresses and it would take nothing away from her."" Instead, what I actually posted was ""You would look cute even wrapped in plastic bags.""

I could end this right there. The words speak for themselves. That's enough of a TIFU, I think. But it got worse. She replied with something along the lines of ""That's not terrifying or anything."" and I immediately realized my fuck up. I tried explaining the plastic clothing to her and I don't think she was buying it. The next day I saw that she had deleted her entire Reddit account. I've not seen her back under a new username. I really must have scared her off.

tl;dr: Told a girl she would be cute wrapped in plastic. Sounded like a serial killer causing her to delete her Reddit account."

4,"TIFU by telling my three year old daughter that I would eat her booty


Alright so let’s start this with a little context because right off the bat reading the title you’ll be like wtf? 

So my wife and 3 year old daughter play tag pretty much on a daily.  And more accurately it’s more of a chase me chase me game, my daughter never chases back when caught. Anyways, the game usually starts by my daughter telling my wife “Mommy, get my booty! Get my booty mom” and off to the races they go. 

Obviously this is a game that both parents play and she’ll also usually request that we be a dinosaur, monster, tiger, etc. This get my booty thing is also something she says at daycare now when playing with friends but luckily everyone thinks it’s cute and we haven’t gotten any feedback on it.

This brings us to last night. The wife is upstairs with our little boy giving him a bath when my daughter jumps on the couch, puts her butt right next to my face and yells “GET MY BOOTY DADDY!” To which I reply nonchalantly “I’m going to eat your booty! Nom nom nom” since her butt was right next to my face. 

I immediately regret it because she jumps off the couch and starts yelling “EAT MY BOOTY DADDY! EAT MY BOOTY” and takes off running. Dear lord, what have I done?! I try to go into damage control and revert back to Get your booty, but it’s too late, eat my booty is the new tag. 

I took her to daycare this morning, I hope she forgot all about it. I’m dreading picking her up.

TL;DR my daughter yells Get my booty to initiate games of tag. With her jumping on the couch and shaking her butt right next to my face I instead say I’m going to eat your booty! She now yells EAT MY BOOTY to imitate the game instead. "
5,"TIFU by opening up to my boss


So Fridays are usually a casual day here in the office so our lunch breaks are sometimes longer than usual. Today My boss and i were the only ones in the office, so we decided to have lunch. I've been working here for 2 years but we don't communicate that often on a personal level. 

&amp;#x200B;

He rode along with me to grab lunch and we started talking about random things that we like. We got along on the topic of science and the anatomy of the body which was pretty cool. Then we spoke about the eye which led to talk about sleep and REM or rapid eye movement, which led to talks of lucid dreaming. That's where i fucked up. 

&amp;#x200B;

I decided to tell him  about how i had a dream once and i realized i was dreaming so i turned myself super saiyan ( powerful and able to fly ) and another where i was going to jail for something i didn't do. I noticed it got awkward and he looked at me kind of judge-y in a way so i tried to change the subject a little. So i then asked him if he had any thoughts that helped him sleep and he just blandly said ""No"". I told him how i think about how sleep is just like time travel and you close your eyes and the next time they open 8 hours have passed by. He laughed a little then had got up and said he had to get back to work. 

&amp;#x200B;

I stayed to clean the table and heard an email pop up on my computer. I finished what i had to and sat on my desk. Turns out i may have opened up a little too much. How do i know? He sent me an [email](https://imgur.com/gallery/KMU3vdV) that was actually meant to go to the accounts guy talking about how weird i am. 

&amp;#x200B;

I figure iv'e got another hour till he realizes, or maybe more who knows. All i know is i'm not looking forward to the confrontation. 

&amp;#x200B;

Tl;dr: My boss an i were he only ones in the office. We got lunch and ate it. I said a bunch of weird things about my dreams and how sleep is like time travel and he sent me an email by accident about how i'm a weirdo. [The email](https://imgur.com/gallery/KMU3vdV) .

6,"TIFU (shoulda just left my neighbor alone)


im keeping names besides mine out of this for privacy. i step outside to smoke a cigarette on my front porch roughly 2 hours ago and as im trying to get my lighter to work i hear crying first off my front porch to my house is enclosed by white gate wall with little holes same for the door so nobody can even see through from the outside, however i can see through from the inside ( it's nice to be able to catch scumbags trying to break into my car in the middle of the night because of this) anyway, i look for the crying it didnt sound like a child it sounded like a full grown woman. i quickly find out who is crying directly across the street from my house to the right 1 house i see my neighbor's significant other on her knees crying like she was. A. beaten up, or B. devastated from something such as a breakup. i heard yelling and stuff breaking last night. i assumed the latter. so i wanted to check if she was at the very least unharmed. i usually keep my nose out of peoples business but the inner captain save a hoe in me kicked in for some reason TBH i try to look out for my neighbors regardless my reasoning behind it is because you live next to them so you may as well be social once or twice just to know if things are going to be chill.

i walk across the street and introduce myself i have not spoken to these people before because they are never home until almost midnight and they leave around 6 a.m. damn near everyday they were very quiet and not nosy in anyway so i never attempted to talk to them when a opportunity to do so in the past arose. i say ""hi im taylor, i apologize for the intrusion i just want to make sure you aren't harmed."" clearly very upset she hardly could speak clearly and started to try to say ""he doesn't want to be with me anymore"" im relieved to know she is fine physically so im ready to say ""best of luck"" and head home. not even 5 seconds pass and the front door opens swiftly and its the neighbor he starts yelling is this the motherfucker you're seeing?.. how did he come to that conclusion? ( if i recognized his face sort of why cant he? ) i try to immediately say ""im your neighbor i was just trying to make sure she was unharmed."" then the woman FUCKS ME OVER dragging me into the drama further she yells "" yeah, this is taylor and hes way better than you in everyway!"" my face turns red out of anger my eyes wide open and mouth agape, why the fuck would you say that? the dude likely interpreted that as why did you just tell him the truth im sure thats how he interpreted it because just as i finish saying WTF to this woman I GET PUNCHED SO FUCKING HARD, i should have seen it coming he was visibly very angry. 

&amp;#x200B;

( now I've done time in prison so i am no stranger to fighting the only reason i mention this is because i want to shed a little perspective on my lifestyle and the reasoning behind my following decision to take matters into my own hands. i do not call cops, i do not ever run from a fight. i never ever ever stick my nose into other peoples business and i broke that rule over a woman crying.)

&amp;#x200B;

i am on someone elses property i get hit. well i have cameras outside my house and i know that his house is within full view so i could have just called the cops and been done with it but no this is something i considered not one bit. i unloaded on this guy he was the same size and build however i was probably in better shape than him aside from my lungs. this woman that made things worse is now full blown hysterical she wailing and crying louder and harder than before and i just beat up my neighbor he beat me up too but this wasn't my first rodeo and this guy was a suit and tie. soft hands no calluses he absolutely made good choices in life and is more successful than me financially but he made a huge mistake as well as i. the noise from this other woman drew the attention of other neighbors now i know most of the immediate surrounding ones except 2 and guess which neighbors came to investigate?take a wild fucking guess? the neighbors i dont know and they are on the phone. (FUCK..........MY...........LIFE) i decided ill go home and pull up the recording so if the police show up i have some sort of defense. i have a record and things look bad im expecting to go to jail for trespassing, assault you name it.

10 minutes later a patrol car arrived and a cop bangs on my door i have the recording on my phone so all i have to do is hand the phone to our officer and let fate decide. i gave my statement in cuffs and im in the back of the car for almost 45 minutes im thinking this is it im screwed. then the magic happened a second patrols car shows up and both officers start talking and watch the video i asked them to look at i know the first officer already saw the video almost right away so im thinking yes they believe me and dude is gonna get his. sure enough they place him in the car and the officer comes over opens the door for me and says step out  unlocks the cuffs and said im not under arrest and that my video saved my ass then they cuff the woman and throw er in the car i was in i asked why she was getting arrested she wasnt in the fight directly. and then i heard the scummiest most absolute piece of garbage thing ever. they both, the couple, tried to say i attacked the dude threatened the woman and i was trying to threaten them from calling the police WHAT THE ABSOLUTE FUCK. an hour ago they were against each other to the point where the woman was getting kicked out of the house. and they actually tried to get me thrown in jail. now the officer said that it looked like what they were saying was true or close to the truth when they watched the video but the audio is what made sure i was innocent they where able to hear part of  the conversation because of their yelling. NEVER AGAIN, NEVER WILL I ENTER DRAMA AND IF MY NEIGHBOR IS SEEN AGAIN I WILL ENJOY SCARING HIM WITH INTIMIDATING LOOKS.

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR - I saw a female neighbor that i didnt know at all crying. went to see if things were fine and it turned into getting puched, almost arrested with accusations of assault and threats"
7,"TIFU by going down on my wife


One of my favorite things to do is go down on my wife. I have a talented tongue and I like to use it. Last night I decided to make that experience even more mind-blowing for my wife by grabbing the dildo and fucking her with it at the same time. Fun times were being had by all and things were getting very hot and very wet. Then my wife started to orgasm and my hand slipped and the dildo shot out of her vagina and directly into my right eye. I pulled away and she asked what was wrong. Not wanting to stop there I told her not to worry about it and I would tell her after. We finish and I go to the bathroom to rinse my face (and eye) and tell her what happened. We both are laughing hard at this but I tell her jokingly ""your vagina just gave me pink eye!""

Well, today my eye was red, itchy, burning, and gross. I just left urgent care with drops for pink eye. My doctor thought it was hilarious and burned my ass on the way out saying ""now go to the pharmacy for your vagina drops!""

I always thought my first lesbian sex injury would be a broken finger.

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR - While going down my wife the dildo popped out of her vagina and hit in the eye resulting in pink eye."
8,"TIFU by ripping my foreskin apart with a ceiling fan


Mandatory not today but 20 years ago. 

I am 16 and horny. We didnt yet have the internet and this was still the days of searching nearby woods for scattered magazines held together by many long rains. It was also the days of waiting for your mom to go to the grocery store and using your free time to try to find literally anything new in the house to have sex with. This was one of those days. 

My mom left for the grocery store and I had an idea: duct tape a toilet paper roll filled with wet toilet paper to my penis. Make sure it's really tight. Then, create a rope from duct tape and wrap it around the blade of the ceiling fan. Sit on one side of the ceiling fan and as the blades spin, it will pull and release the tube. Brilliant. 

All starts well as I sit on a desk chair below the fan. A bit slow, but working so I turn it up. I start to notice that since there is no swivel, the duct tape is twisting and shortening. Its pulling violets on my pubes and skin. I cant get the fucking thing off. Fuck. I stand up to buy myself time. Shut off the fan: pull the string and wait. Oh fuck - faster. I'm on my tippy toes and my pubes are ripping. I pull the string and the fan begins to slow, but it's still twisting. I slam my hand into the fan to stop it. The fan breaks out of the ceiling. 

As I unpackage my pleasure package, I find I'd ripped a fist full of pubes out. My foreskin was twisted like an Indian sunburn, checkered with blood and tears and the head of my penis is a ghostly grey.

It took 24 hours for the penis head to turn from mayonnaise to plum. My penis basically moulted over the next 3 weeks growing a new layer of penis over the old penis. I still have a long white scar down the shaft.

Good times. 

Tl;dr: duct taped my penis to a ceiling fan and ripped my pubes and foreskin apart.

9,"TIFU by eating a 7 million Scoville unit hot sauce infused spaghetti and going down on my wife.


I had a large group of people over that were hungry and were self-proclaimed, ""chili-heads."" I doubted their true understanding of the level of hot sauce I had and gave them a stern warning of what was to come. Yet, one girl, with Venezuelan heritage claimed she could take any level of heat. Well, I cooked up a batch of spaghetti and put a liberal amount of ""The Source"" hot sauce - Google it to see just how hot this compares to most ""spicy"" things. I served my guests, with another strong warning that it was going to be hell for some, but alas they were all willing. I too would partake in dinner as well, as my palette had become accustom to this sauce and it wasn't too bad for me anymore and was a prerequisite for them to do it as well.

&amp;#x200B;

Fast forward about 5 to 10 minutes and everyone is losing their collective shit. People holding their mouths under the sink, pounding beer to soothe the pain, and out miss Venezuela in a ball on the ground crying. I consoled her the best I could and offered some remedy techniques. All the while, I'm quietly laughing with my now wife (she didn't partake, smart).

&amp;#x200B;

I wait another 2 hours to make sure no one needs to go to the hospital... we're good, most have have calmed down and are feeling a little better, including a much more humbled Venezuelan girl. Myself, I consume a bunch of crackers and wash my mouth out with plenty of water and booze. Now, high on endorphins and, well, booze. I'm feeling like I want to get into some sexy times. My wife and I retire upstairs where we immediately start getting naughty.

&amp;#x200B;

I go down on her and she's enjoying it, well initially. She starts to make weird noises and I ask if everything's ok, to which she replies, ""it, it just feels weird,"" but insists that I continue. Another 5 minutes pass and she completely stops me, ""ok, something wrong it just feels really weird."" I comply and think nothing of it in my inebriated state, so we transition to having sex. Of course, I'm enjoying myself and getting into, man it's really sensitive right now - I think to myself, I'm tingling with excitement! Huh, wait, it's now starting to burn a little. My mind's racing what could be wrong, then it hits me. ""Oh shit, The Fucking Source!"" I exclaimed to her. We both jump off and start paying close attention to our genitals. Pain building and for some reason, my Johnson is starting to really hurt. I'm pacing back and forth, holding my Sneaky Pete in front of the fan, doing anything I can to relieve the pain. My wife clutching her vaheyhey like she's about to give birth.

&amp;#x200B;

10 minutes pass and I'm finding absolutely no relief, but my wife for some reason is taking it like a champ. I start to panic, as I'm really burning up, downstairs. I run into the bathroom and start slashing water from the sink on my Nixon. Brief relief, followed by immediate pain. Fuck. Finally I say strew this shit: I fill up the sink to the brim and lay face first on the counter with my twig and berries fully submerged in this life saving water. I stay in that position for a good 20 minutes. Finally I retract my Stanley Steamer from this holy water. Ahhhhhhhh, the pain has finally subsided enough to return to bed. I regaled my wife of my fateful bathroom story and we laugh for a good 20 minutes. Needless to say, we waited a good day for the fire to complete snuff out until we got frisky again.

&amp;#x200B;

TL:DR. Ate one of the hottest hot sauces in the world, went down on my wife then had sex. Dick burned like hell and plunged my meat into a sink to relieve the pain."
10,"TIFU by not putting away the Valentine's Day toys


It's been like two hours and I still feel like dying. 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

My girlfriend of a year and a half is a delightfully sweet, kind, and bubbly lady who everyone describes as adorable, as she very much is. She comes off as fairly innocent and people often assume she's very sheltered and naive. However, 

&amp;#x200B;

she is a God damn *freak* in the bedroom. 

&amp;#x200B;

You name any toy, she has it; electric shock toys, cuffs, whips, ball gags, nipple clamps, rope, dildos the size of my forearm, massive butt plugs, everything. The woman is an absolute BDSM connoisseur and it sure took my vanilla-ass by surprise when we first started dating. On Valentine's Day, she broke out a ton of toys--specifically, anal ones. She ***loves*** anal, but we only do it once in a blue moon because it takes a long time for her to get ""prepped,"" and oftentimes I'm too impatient to wait. However, she had the day off and had plenty of time to get ready by the time I got home from work. Cue absolute butt destruction. 

&amp;#x200B;

After we finished, I took all of the toys (some are *very* expensive vibrators) and carefully washed them in the kitchen sink and kept them out to air dry. 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

My mom texted me last night and asks for some ""mother-son bonding"" time, which usually means free food and she dumps much-needed essentials on me like toilet paper and cleaning supplies. Yes please! 

&amp;#x200B;

Now, my mom is delightful but can be quite intimidating. She's a pantsuit wearin', Mini Cooper drivin', independent woman who don't need no man (except for my dad, apparently). She has no problems speaking what's on her mind and that very second and is very stubborn with her beliefs. She also works at a nonprofit sexual assault prevention center and as such, recently became quite 'woke' (as she puts it) about sexual health in general. 

&amp;#x200B;

She comes into my apartment because she needs to use the restroom and I'm sitting at the table playing on my phone. She comes out and just stands in the kitchen, silent. I don't think anything of it because I'm trying to catch a Snorlax. 

&amp;#x200B;

""\[Scandaboo\], what are *these.""*

&amp;#x200B;

I look up and realize that she's looking at the *massive* amount of sex toys all lined up on the counter. 

&amp;#x200B;

*NononononononOOOOOOOOOO.* 

&amp;#x200B;

Panicking, my dumbass says the first thing I thought of. 

&amp;#x200B;

""Those are \[girlfriend\]'s anal toys, not mine!"" 

&amp;#x200B;

She judgingly looks down at these huge vibrators and dildos, back to me, back to the toys, and back to me. 

&amp;#x200B;

Mom: Do you expect me to believe that sweet little \[girlfriend\] would use *any* of these?!

Me: Uh...

Mom: \[Scandaboo\], there's nothing wrong with admitting you like to use these. After all, your first relationship was with a guy.

Me: THEY'RE NOT MINE.

Mom: Don't drag \[girlfriend\] into this, she probably doesn't even know what these are!

Me: Yes she does!

Mom: Honey, are you having any second thoughts about your sexuality?

Me: What? No, absolutely not! 

Mom: If you are, you need to talk to her before things get out of hand, I'd hate for you guys to lose contact.

Me: MOM, I'M VERY MUCH INTO HER, I PROMISE. 

Mom: Alright, alright. But at least don't lie to me and tell me these belong to her. She grew up in a very Christian household so I don't believe at *all* she would be exposed to these things. 

&amp;#x200B;

Knowing I've been defeated, I just sigh and sink my head down. 

&amp;#x200B;

Me: Okay, okay, they're mine.

Mom: That's better. Now put these away before your landlord comes in for an inspection.

&amp;#x200B;

Lunch was unbelievably awkward for me, and thinking about how my mom absolutely insisted I put things up my butt is making me cringe *hardcore.* Not that there's anything wrong with it, but she's my *mom.* Anyone know how to make the earth swallow you whole? 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR: Used a bunch of anal toys with my extremely innocent-seeming but incredibly kinky, anal-loving girlfriend, accidentally left them out on the counter for my mom to see and now she's convinced that I enjoy putting things that size of a clenched fist in my asshole.

11,"TIFU by trying to take a Calc 2 exam with a concussion and a bleeding face


So, I live in the freezing north, and all the sidewalks are covered in ice. It was particularly bad last night, when I was going too fast, slid out and took a fall on my electric scooter. (the real fuck up) 

I was going a bit fast down the sidewalk, since I had to make it to a Calc 2 exam on the other side of my college campus. I lost control, and fell on my face pretty much right outside the dorm. I had glasses on at the time, which got bent up and cut me right next to my eye. I didn't know how bad it was, only that it was bleeding, so I decided to continue on and try to make the exam. (I'd been studying for this for weeks, I wasn't about to miss it). Honestly I have no idea how I survived the rest of the way to the exam, cause I wasn't exactly in great shape at that moment. (fuckup #2, but really more stupid choice that didn't turn out too badly) 

I get to the exam, and get some odd looks from the people around me, probably because pretty much the whole left side of my face was covered in blood. I try to start taking the exam (fuckup #3), and on the first question, I realize a few things. First off, I realize I'm having a hard time focusing and that I have a blind spot just to the left of my center of vision. Second off, I realize there's no way I can finish the exam right now. And third off, I should probably call an ambulance cause I definetly have a concussion and a large laceration next to my eye.

After that, I talk to a rather suprised TA and sign up for the make-up exam the following morning, (today), and then get an ambulance to the hospital, where I got 7 stitches, a concussion diagnosis, and a CT scan of my head and neck that came back fine. My blind spot also went away pretty soon after the the ambulance came. 

On the bright side, I took the exam super early this morning, and despite the concussion and the eye thing my studying paid off and I'm pretty sure I aced it.

TL;DR: Gets concussion and face laceration on the way to an exam, scooters all the rest of the way and starts taking the test before realizing I really need to call an ambulance."
12,"TIFU by asking the universe for a sign to follow my dream. Then getting one.


I've always had a fear of asking for a sign of some sort because I always thought it would be something drastic.

Going against that belief last week, I wanted to know if I should follow my dream or continue waking up M-F, at 5a, to do tedious warehouse work.

Today I got that sign.. and got laid off. Our warehouse is closing its doors on march 15th. My boss didn't even see this coming and he's been here 15+ years. This was a complete shock to everyone on the warehouse level.

Such a shock that I got a fortune cookie 2 weeks ago that said ""you will see a change in employment"" and threw it out (i never really purposely throw away fortune cookies) because I knew the only way that would happen is if I wanted a change. And I wasn't looking.

This is drastic!

TL;DR: asked for a sign to follow my dream and got one. Got laid off.

13,"TIFUpdate - My teacher texted a love letter to my crush [PART 2]


**This is a follow-up to [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/as0p0a/tifu_when_my_teacher_texted_a_love_letter_to_my/?st=JSB08N00&amp;sh=e657bf05)**

All right; it’s around 4 PM in California and I’ve had time to get home from school and recollect my thoughts. I’ll present them to you now.

After this teacher sent the letter (*point of clarification: this isn’t something she just did for me; she does that to anyone caught with their phone out. usually it’s just a friend so the joke is obvious*), I got my phone back and needless to say, paid attention for the rest of the class period. I heard my phone vibrate a few times but I was absolutely petrified and refused to lay a finger on it. Seriously, I’m one of the most confident and daring people you’ll ever meet, but she has a way of freezing me to my very core.

I didn’t want to run the risk of encountering her during lunch so I fled to Chick-Fil-A with my friends to brief them on the situation and plan a course of action. I’m tellin’ ya, this was the kind of intelligence meeting that’d give the CIA a run for its money. Much to my chagrin, she and her friends pull up (it’s a popular establishment, especially with teenagers in our area). It’s thoroughly possible a friend of mine ratted my location out though; I’ll be sure to knock some sense into him later.

These girls order their food and make their way over to a table across the room, where I can see them giggling and whispering while glancing at me the way adolescent women tend to do. My crush was turning beet-red at this point, so I decided to suck it up and confront her, since I’d have to talk to her eventually.

I invite her over to a separate 2-person table to have our lunches. Falling in line to stereotypes on teen boys, my friends start making obscene gestures (such as pulling a finger in and out of a circle of two fingers on the other hand, or simulating a blowjob while moving their fist back and forth against their mouth). I can’t look like a barbaric horndog so I ignore them.

My crush has me take out my phone to read what she said so we can talk about it. This whole time she’s been kinda solemn and serious, and I can feel my heart sinking. I gotta face the music though, so I whip out iMessage...

&gt; *My beloved (name),*
&gt; *Words cannot describe the way you make me feel. You’ve managed to find a special place in my heart and I’d be so happy if you’d stay there with me. The way you laugh, smile, joke, and go about your life melts me to the bone. Even silly things like hearing you sneeze makes me want to close my eyes and smile. If you’d like, we can go out some time soon. McDonald’s or Burger King sounds nice. I know this is a bit late, but will you be my Valentine?*
&gt; *With love, SuperDende9000*

I facepalm right in front her. *What was she thinking? Seriously?! McDonald’s and Burger King? Mrs. (name), you better be giving me extra credit later...*

I keep reading. My crush basically texted me back saying it was overwhelming and a bit intense, but that she’s had the hots for me for a while now. While she doesn’t feel the same way (as in, she doesn’t “love me yet,” which makes sense because we haven’t been dating), she’d like to see where this goes. And no, we’re not going to a damn fast-food restaurant.

We start bursting out in laughter after the fact, and our squads start high-fiving eachother like it’s NASA’s Mission Control. I tell her I don’t want to make things official until we figure out how to navigate our relationship, which we’ll be doing by meeting up this Friday at a coffee shop. After the meal, I pull her into a hug and rest my chin on her head; feeling her pressed against my chest was the best feeling I’ve had in a long time (even if the other patrons thought our PDA was a bit much).


Of course, the car ride back to school with my friends is a riot, and I’m still being spammed from texts across the school from nosy randos desperate for a juicy story. Someone even starting asking me really intimate questions like when the baby shower is, what I want to name our children, etc etc. I don’t know about that, but I know damn well I better pull a 5 on the AP Calculus exam this May. If there’s any teacher who deserves that kind of effort, it’s the one who let this all happen.

I’ll be updating once more at the end of the week.

**TL;DR: Teacher texts love letter to crush from my phone (context in [original post](https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/as0p0a/tifu_when_my_teacher_texted_a_love_letter_to_my/?st=JSB08N00&amp;sh=e657bf05https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/as0p0a/tifu_when_my_teacher_texted_a_love_letter_to_my/?st=JSB08N00&amp;sh=e657bf05)). I evade the impending confrontation until lunch, when we have a quick chat. If you want to know how this chaos ended, don’t be lazy and read the damn post. Or scroll down to the comments.**"
14,"TIFU by drinking alcohol and hitting my wife and kids


My kids (5&amp;7) are in the very curious stage of life and ask a ton of questions about everything. Apparently, they asked another adult what alcohol was and why people drink it. While explaining it to them, this person thought it was a good idea to tell them the dark side of alcohol use - dependence, making regrettable decisions, and even becoming violent with ones family. As you can imagine, that last part stuck with my kids who have seen me drink before (I have maybe one drink every month or two).  They told me all this while I was having a beer, and me being the responsible, loving father I am knew what to do. I took a sip of my beer, started yelling ""alcohollll"" and play hitting them. They laughed, and I calmly explained to them that alcohol is okay in moderation, etc. I didn't realize until I was telling this story to a co-worker later that my kids may now tell people that Daddy drinks alcohol and screams and hits them. 

TLDR- I pretended to be a violent drunk with my kids, now I'm worried child services may show up.

15,"TIFU by digging too deep for the sake of a dad joke.


Obligatory; I tell this story on behalf of my older brother, who doesn't appreciate internet points as I do, and that this didn't happen today, but in summer 2016. This is a lengthy one, tl;dr at the bottom.

&amp;#x200B;

A quick backstory, me and my brother were kind of the ""middle children"", being born only one year apart but four years later that our older siblings and 4 year before our little sister. We grew up to be very similar in many ways, and especially humor wise.. We were always the clowns, trying to make friends and family laugh. And it drives our partners nuts. This is why I want to share this story. So, back in 2016 they had just bought their first house from a countryside, and it needed a lot of renovating. The house was originally built in the 1930's or 1940's, and it hadn't had a renovation for a very long time. My brother is a handy man and did a lot of it himself. They did a lot of work on the large yard they had, and some of the work required an excavator that will be the main tool of the fuckup.

&amp;#x200B;

It was a beautiful, hot summer day and they had some friends, family and neighbors over to celebrate Midsummer day. It's a big holiday here, probably bigger that Christmas. Now, my brother is not a much of a drinker, but when he drinks even a little, he goes hyper. The night was going great all in all, wine was flowing at an appropriate rate, sauna was hot, outdoor dinner was wonderful, people were not too drunk (which is nice since usually the standard state for a Finn on Midsummer day is absolutely wasted), kids were having a blast on trampoline, fishing, playing nerf war etc.

&amp;#x200B;

Now to the fuckup. The dark and dangerous turn started when my girlfriend tried to craft some pun about my brother turning into a hillbilly and my brother was not having it. At that moment I saw it in his eyes: he had an unimaginable comeback on his mind. His expression turned into almost a villainous look. He calmly stood up, told everybody to sit tight (we were outside at the dining table) and went inside the house. Then I hear a door slam on the other side of the house. I had a bad feeling about this.

&amp;#x200B;

Few moments later this madman comes back driving the damn excavator. He stopped maybe 6-8 meters from the table and started digging a hole in the ground. At this point we were all very confused about what he was up to and his wife was getting kinda furious. He then proceeds to slam the cabin door open and shouts: ""SORRY, I'M REALLY TRYING TO FIND THE JOKE, BUT NO MATTER HOW DEEP I DIG, I JUST CAN'T FIND IT!""

&amp;#x200B;

Everybody lost their shit, even his wife. We were laughing or asses off and at this point most of the kids had gathered near all this. There were maybe 25 people watching this show, and then it happened. As the joke started to die and my brother tipped over the last chuck of dirt into a pile between us and the excavator, I saw it. A WW2 ERA BOMB SMASHED TO THE GROUND RIGHT THERE IN THE MIDDLE OF ALL OF US. Panic. Kids and some of the women start to scream, people falling out of their chairs and everybody running away from the area. This was not the first time for me, since I used to work a lot on construction sites, and this happens more often than you might think. Drunk me tried to remain as calm as I could, tried to get everyone to go inside the house and called the emergency number.

&amp;#x200B;

10 minutes later fire department arrived, then few minutes later the police and few ambulances, and then a medical helo and eventually the bomb squad came. Let's just say the tradition of lighting a midsummer pyre (bonfire) was skipped that  summer. Construction was put on hold and the whole property was checked for more explosives in following days, and one more bomb was found. 

&amp;#x200B;

tl,dr: My girlfriend made a pun of my brother being a hillbilly, brother committed too much to the dad joke comeback and dug up a WW2 era bomb from his yard with an excavator.

16,"TIFU by using my PC the wrong way for 2 years


I’ll start with some quick information: I got this PC on Christmas Day of 2016. It has an i7 processor, so it’s supposed to be fast and efficient. Of course, I never knew what fast and efficient was until today.

Back to the present. Yesterday, I wanted to stream World of Warcraft. It was an idea I had for a while now, so I downloaded Streamlabs OBS and tried streaming WoW. The problem? Streamlabs was only picking up on 1.00 KB/s for response time and it was skipping over 1000 frames. I checked my CPU usage, and sure enough, all of my applications were using up a ton of my CPU. If I even clicked on an application window, the usage would go up by 20%. I had been used to slowness like this before Streamlabs, but when Streamlabs literally made my stream freeze, I was determined to fix things.

I re-downloaded WoW. It took 6 hours because the download speed was 4.00 MB/s, something else I was used to until today. I also cleared all of my applications’ caches and deleted unneeded stuff. After all of that, guess what? **My CPU usage still peaks to 100%, even if I just click on the god damn application.**

I take my problem to Reddit, and after some deep diving, 5 system resets and deleting my antivirus software, u/redrage97 uncovers that my i7 processor, which should be using 4 cores and 8 logical processors, was only using 1 core and 2 logical processors. It was literally only doing 1/4th of the job it was supposed to.

1/4th of the job... for 2 years (even less than 1/4 actually).

There was a button hidden deep in some advanced options that I had to uncheck so it didn’t limit the processors. Now, my CPU usage never goes over 50% thanks to that small detail. My download speed is 60 MB/s, and I’m not lagging at all anymore.

I’m just really dumb.

TL;DR: I had a laggy computer for 2 years, didn’t know why. Tried to stream but it lagged out way too much. I find out my processor is only doing less than 1/4th of the work it’s supposed to for 2 entire years, and I check a simple button and my computer works as it should’ve been working for... 2 years."
