0,"TIFU by telling both my wife and mom about an item on eBay I wanted for my birthday...they unknowingly got into a bidding war against each other and drove the price up considerably.


So my birthday is coming up and I found an item on eBay that I thought would be cool as a present. I figured I would casually mention it to both my wife and my mom...not thinking that either of them would actually try to bid on it.

Well lo and behold, they BOTH ended up bidding on it to try to win it for a birthday present for me and they unknowingly got into a bidding war with each other!!! They ended up driving up the price by about $200 before my wife finally won the auction. They could have just bought it new in the store for $50 less then she won it for!

TL;DR: I mentioned to both my wife and mom about an item on eBay I thought would be nice for my birthday...they unknowingly got into a bidding war against each other and drove the price up considerably.

1,"TIFU by riding horses, having long hair and labia.


I am spooked and mortified right now. 

So I’m a female with rather long hair who rides horses - I have 3, compete regularly etc. 

Anyway, yesterday I was happily riding my first of two horses for the day, when about half way through I thought I had a wedgie. No big deal, pull/shuffle it out and move on, yeah? A little while later I felt it again and pulled it out again. 

I finished my ride, tacked up the second horse, then rode him. Again I kept feeling this discomfort wedgie, they weren’t even the right pants to give me a wedgie! 

Anyway I shook it off as no biggie, finished the horses for the night, went home, showered, then went out to see some friends. 

This morning, I awoke at around 6.30am with intense labial pain. Yep. So I grab a mirror and have a look and OH JEEZ it’s a horror. There is a dark red LUMP. A big one. Perhaps fingernail sized. At first I thought my clit was inflamed. Nope, not that... STD? Googled them all. Nope. A moment later I realise *there is a hair hanging off it*. Yep. I think I have given myself a labial hair tourniquet.

With my hair length I often end up with hair on my clothing so I’m thinking the friction from riding caused the hair to get looped around. Apparently showering means the hair gets looser and when it dries it tightens... so uh. I’m on my way to A &amp; E as I can’t remove it myself. There is definitely a hair dangling down. I didn’t notice anything last night. 

I can’t wait to have some doctors look at my poorly labia ): 

TL;DR: horse riding friction caused (what I think is) labial hair tourniquet and now doctors can look at my labia!! "
2,"TIFU by making a viral video that hit the top post on Reddit for a while and then accidently removing it off of both, Reddit AND YouTube because of my stupidity. (And not reading the rules)


I made a video about me having a series of bad luck moments throughout the day (I really still think I'm cursed because the bad luck doesnt stop). Surprisingly it got a huge reception and I was pretty pleased. 

I then got messaged by a lot of companies giving me offers on copyrighting the video so it doesnt get mass reproduced and that if it does, I'd get compensated instead of them making money off of me and giving me nothing. I was like, ""Sure that doesnt sound too bad."" The problem was that because of my negligence and not knowing what I should/shouldn't be doing, I didnt realize that I was actually breaking rule #8 on r/videos where I can't get licensed for the video after it has been posted. So yes. Obviously, my post got removed because of third party licensing. 

Proof: http://imgur.com/gallery/1iIqdJB


BUT not to worry. I still had my YouTube video. With a decent amount of views ~500k I still had a shot at fame. I thought I'd also make a follow-up update video for all the people who had asked if my luck had improved. So I made the follow up video. Titled it the SAME as my viral video. Noticed an editing error. Wanted to take it off and upload a new one. Deleted it. Realized that I accidently deleted THE ORIGINAL VIDEO. Now all traces of my videos are removed and I now have 20 views on each video but hey, it was a wild journey (and a terrible fuckup) which I'll never forget. I like to think that the video going viral was an addition to the curse more than a blessing considering how I ruined everything and will always regret this moment for the rest of my life.  

Tl;dr: Made a viral video. Got greedy and didnt read subreddit rules and got it removed. Also removed it off of YouTube by being stupid. "
3,"TIFU by masturbating with a vacuum hose


I've been seeing lots of storys here of people masturbating with household items, so here's my contribution.
Using a throwaway... obviously.

I was 15 at the time, being a horny teenager I was constantly looking to *relieve* myself.

I was home alone one day and I see the vacuum in the cupboard without it's head, I had a brilliant idea to *ahem* replace the head with my own. Seemed like a good idea...
I finish masturbating with it, no issues, not for now anyway, those come later.

I use it a few more times over the following week, it felt pretty good... until the last time.

One afternoon me and my mother were home alone, I see the not-so innocent vacuum sitting pretty in a bedroom. 
I started out as I had been for the past week: took my pants off, and went to town...

What I hadn't noticed is that the power button on the vacuum was pushed, and the cord was running out of the room into another room, it wasn't running because it wasn't plugged into an outlet.

Mid-way through masturbating, my mother plugged the cable end (as I said: sitting in another room) of the vacuum into an outlet... she was just about to start vacuuming...
Of course she wouldn't have known that her son's penis was in the end of it.

You'd think that a vacuum giving you head would feel good, but I was not expecting that.
I proceed to try to pull my penis out, but I bent it midway through taking it out.
I screamed.
You should have seen my mother's face as she was looking down at her son who was screaming on the floor with his dick out.

Of course she had a lot of confusion, but seeing me screaming on the floor holding my dick prompted her to help me up and get to the hospital. 
She didn't ask anything on the way there, it was the most uncomfortable ride ever, I was embarrassed and in severe pain.

We get to the ER and they pretty much led me straight to the doctor without any wait.

After a few tests and asking me what happened (with my mother in the same room), they said I had a penile fracture.
*Well shit.*
The operation lasted about an hour or so, after the operation my mother and father (who had just gotten there) didn't say anything.

It's been 9 years since and my relationship with my parents has never really been the same. I still have problems down there, too.

TL;DR
Used the vacuum hose to masturbate, my mother turned the vacuum on, I bend my penis while trying to take it out, ended up getting a penile fracture while ruining my relationship with my parents."
4,"TIFU by putting tequilla in the wrong hole, on purpose


So I'm a guy who is generally unsatisfied with life currently, and looking for new experiences. So when thinking of something to do with a large bottle of tequila that I absolutely couldn't stand the flavor of, I thought back to when I read about about a bunch of crazy frat boys that invented butt chugging. I thought it'd be perfect because it'd be a crazy new experience and that way I wouldn't taste the tequila. 

I decided on two and a half jiggers administered by a large syringe (not the kind with a needle). I had heard of people overdosing by putting in whole bottles so I wasn't about to be that stupid. With my butt in the air, I began to slowly inject the fluid into my anal cavity. Sure it stung a little bit, but I wasn't deterred. 

I waited and nothing happened.

Finally I decided it was time to expel the stuff and head to bed. That was the hard part. The burning was like a mother puma giving birth in my butthole. The pain in my unhappy intestines began to grow to a roar. Then I began to literally sweat tequila. It was pretty warm in the bathroom, but this was no normal sweat. I could taste the harsh flavor of agave in every drop of sweat that rolled down my face into my mouth. The last stage was desparate contractions of my poo muscles (to be scientific) coupled with nausea and several close calls with emptying my stomach. Well, that and fear, regret, some bargaining with higher powers. 

I was in the bathroom suffering for an estimated 1 1/2 to 2 hours. During this all this i noticed only a vague sensation of alcoholic stupor. I tested myself multiple times to see if I was drunk. No dice.

Yesterday I woke up to serious muscle cramps in my abdomen and a run to the bathroom which resulted in a mess of bloody mucus. I'm still contemplating a hospital visit.

That was on Thursday and my bowels are still sore. I suspect I may have internal burns, but hopefully they'll heal on their own. I dread seeing a doctor because my parents will get the whole story and they still think I'm a decent young man who definitely doesn't drink.



TL:DR I squirted straight tequila into my anus and damaged my insides. 



  "
5,"TIFU by getting a job I'm not qualified for based on one itty bitty lie that turned into a giant facade. Too deep in it now to get out.


Resubmitted with a TLDR

Long, but bear with me, and marvel at my apparent sociopathic manipulation.

A year and a half ago I became interested in a certain field that I had no involvement or expertise in. Completely different from what I got my BA in, but it seemed cool. Fast paced, challenging, STEM field. Spent some time researching the field and came across the top company in the field and became really interested in what they do. Wanted to meet someone from the company to talk about he field and learn more so that I would know what direction I should take. Literally move to the city this company is based in because I'm a crazy person and wanted to be close to the company and Top University in the field, because in my stupid brain I think I thought that success and knowledge can be obtained much like osmosis.

Emailed and emailed and emailed..... No one would answer my emails.

And why would they? I had no introduction or involvement in the field. So I thought hey, maybe I can make myself sound more enticing. I sent an email again, only this time I send it to a higher up who went to Top University and told him that I was interested in learning about the company and field and that I was applying to Top University for grad school. I mentioned that I had my BA in a different field, but that I had been taking relevant classes for pre requisites to be admitted to the field.

Lo and Behold, I get an answer. My email bounces around until it lands in the inbox of the VP, who then sets up a lunch meeting with me. Lunch meeting goes great! I researched the company thoroughly and had a lot of questions, learned a lot about the field, and VP and other guests that came to the lunch (two managers) seemed to love me.

Then came mistake number 1: I was feeling confident, everyone was laughing at my jokes, I sounded knowledgeable and enthusiastic, so I point blank asked them to hire me. Why not, I thought? It was bold, but they seemed to dig me, and the worst they could do is say no, which was what I expected.

But they didn't.

They enthusiastically set up an interview with the manager of the company's A-team. Why? Who the heck knows. Whatevs, I'll go to the interview for experience. NO WAY I'll get the job.

This is where the narrator from Arrested Development would say ""She did get the job"". Because I did. I had a soft science degree and was now working for the top company in a difficult STEM field. I pretty much taught myself everything as I went along. Google and I are best friends. Started taking night classes in the classes I claimed to had already taken. Things are stressful as fuck but somehow I maintain good relations with everyone and do well on projects and receive a lot of praise. Cool. Seem to have gotten away with that one.

Oh, except remember I said I was applying to Top University that year? I didn't, of course, because I had no pre reqs. However. One day, a coworker asks me in passing ""Hey, I heard you got into Top University!"" Obviously something she misheard. Being that it was the early morning and before I was lucid with caffeine I mumbled ""Oh, yeah, thanks"" without thinking. Because I'm a fucking dumbass.

Well that spread quickly and one of the managers bought me gifts with Top University's logo before I realize how quickly I was sinking in my lies. Too embarrassed to say anything to the gift. Other managers tell me how proud they are of me. I meant to come clean during my review to some degree....maybe claim to be deferring or something.....but my review started quickly and aggressively circled around how ""highly intelligent"" I am and I couldn't bring myself to say anything. If only they knew. I don't really know what to do, so I just keep going with it. Get a 1% raise. Get put on bigger projects. Lead a project. Higher ups take me to lunch to talk to me about my career development and to invite me to some social events to network. Get invited to an awards ceremony for a project company did. I start studying for credentials and licensing exams that my company is paying for because why the fuck wouldn't I dig myself deeper into this?

So that's where I am. I ""start"" school at Top University on Monday. Sitting in a coffee shop right now and genuinely considering leaving the country and changing my name. I keep buying skin care products to distract myself from my absolute fuck up. Anyone know if derma rollers are worth the hype? FML. 

TL;DR: Lied about my qualifications to have an opportunity to talk to a company about a field I'm 120% unqualified for. Get cocky and get a job. In 2 Deep. They think I am now attending the top university of the field and somehow I'm still doing well with the company."
6,"TIFU By getting an 8 inch dildo stuck in my arse.


This happened 6 days ago because I can't post sexual content on weekdays you are getting this now...

This is gonna be a long post, like the thing I just had inside me.

Let's just clarify in case someone asks. This is a throwaway, yes I am male, I am straight (Now debatable), I am not going to shit right for weeks. This was one of the biggest fuck ups of my life. So some backstory I bought one of the cheapest dildos I could get on amazon. This dildo also happened to be 15 inches long and everything else was above £20. When I received it I broke the dildo into two separate pieces. I broke it unevenly so there was a 8 inch and a 7 inch to use.

I have used the dildo a few times before, very rarely and I was watching some anal porn and got in the mood to have a go. Anyway I am sorta getting into it and going in kinda hard and then pop... I push a bit too hard and my hand slips. The fella just slides all the way in, at this point I am like ohh guess I will just push you out. Nah that was not happening. The dildo had made it's way pas the S-curve of my rectum so it was very stuck.

I was worried and I were starting to feel some sharp pains and bellyache, I sit on the toilet for a solid 10 minutes trying to reach up there just managing to get my finger to touch it and wiggle it about a bit. No use I started to panic and called the U.K. NHS help service on 111 but because I was sweating so much the numbers were not properly responding and the microphone became quiet so every conversation I have on the phone now had to be in speaker for the recipient to hear me. Anyway they said they would get back to me in at least 4 hours with a service to drop me off at A&amp;E. Until then they said call the ambulance if it gets any worse. Which it did I was close to having a panic attack and I was worried about ""toxic shock"" which can be fatal if foreign objects are in your body for too long. So I called the ambulance, The responder said your symptoms aren't any of immediate medical concern (no bleeding, ect) right now so an ambulance should be down in 2 hours.

By this time I was just out of ideas so I mustered the strength to call my mum. She wasn't best too pleased but she is a very understanding person and already knew about the dildo basically just said "" I told you something would happen and your dads going to be home any minute."" I SHIT YOU NOT as she said that my dad walks through the door. My mum is like ""You gotta tell him"" and she keeps repeating this and I keep saying ""No"" every time. You see my dad is the opposite of my mum, kinda homophobic, sexual stuff not to be mentioned, so this was not looking good. My mum convinces to tell my dad and demands that I stay on speaker so she can hear me talk to him.

I say to my dad ""I have done something extremely stupid"" my mum from speaker phone says ""He has something stuck in his poo pipe"" (fuck sake mum) I tell my dad the situation and what is stuck after he says ""I don't care about what is stuck just that it needs to come out"", surprisingly he is completely cool using his phone to look for solutions trying things like baby oil ect. we go through a few all with no luck

He suggested that we just go to the hospital so I get ready and my dad says have you tried just getting in a hot shower. So I got in... This felt like it was doing nothing like the others, but making my bellyache worse so I decided to call it quits anyway I say to my dad ""right not working"" and get dry to put my clothes on. I bend over and get a really harsh pain like I am about to have diarrhoea and so I decide okay one last push. The pain escalates a bit then BAM the fucker just slides right out. I shout ""IT'S OUT"" and so a few minutes I clean the bathroom the and get rid of both the dildos. My dad keeps asking if I am fine.

Then we are up-to now. I have called all the emergency services back and cancelled the ambulances and everything feels fine. Except I now have a sore throat from the groaning I made when pushing and I think I have burst a few blood vessels from pushing. To be honest it doesn't even feel that great anyway the male G-spot is a hoax guys.

Tl;Dr: Got a 8"" dildo stuck in the fartbox, dad comes home and I admit to him what has happened. Cause mobile phone to malfunction because the copious amounts of sweat I was producing and didlo slides out after a hot shower."
7,"TIFU by giving a stranger almost $10,000 and it wasn't a scam.


So this fuck up started over 4 years ago.

When I got out of the navy I landed a new good paying job. With this job they had direct deposit, so I got a new bank from the one I had in the military.

I set up the direct deposit to my main bank and I was thinking to myself ""hey I'm going to get paid good I'll set up a direct deposit of $200 a month to my old bank and forget about it."" I forgot about it.

Fast forward 4 and half years. Me and my wife are trying to get our house repaired and up to standards to sell. We got some bids to do the flooring and paint the house. The bids ce back between $8000 and $12000. We didnt know what we were going to do.

So I decided I can try to tackle the flooring by myself. While I was beating on the tile to get it up it occured to me ""hey I put money in my old account we can use that. 

I log in online and the account only had $5. That's not right let me refresh. $5. O no. Ok ok dont freak out. I'll call the bank and see what's up.

""No sir we dont have any transactions from you for about 5 years.""

So I'm freaking out. I log onto the company site and see I have the routing number check. Account number wrong. FUCK.  so i gave a complete stranger $100 twice a month for 4 and a half years. 

So if you are out there i hope you used it wisely. 

TLDR: messed up my account number and gave someone else about $10000 over the course of 4 and half years."
8,"TIFU by thinking people speak English like they do in action movies.


Mandatory this happen back when i was in middle school in the  90s.

So i grew up in a country where English is a mandatory second language in middle and high school and being the younger brother of geeks i learned my english from a very young age. my sources were our family's DOS operated PC and the fantasy and action movies of the 80s and 90s. Therefor I, and i suppose many other none native speakers, assumed people speak like Eddie Murphy in 48 hours.

&amp;#x200B;

Anyhow, when i started middle school i got into a native speakers class for English, which consisted of a bunch of native speakers and myself. First week, teacher wants to evaluate us as one would expect and gives us texts we've never seen before with words blanked out. i was used to this test and i usually ace it so i wasn't really worried. Seconds later i was mortified to find out that in this class there are no multiple choices for any of the blanks!!! 

I was thinking hard how to recover from this, i did not know 4 of the 12 words in the test and most likely misspelled the others (cause who spells?!). then i figured it out, i'll let her know my English is much better then this test shows. so i decide to write down next to the words i didn't know ""This is fucking shit!"". To make sure she understands the reference i then drew an arrow for to the words i left blank. 

I went out of there honestly thinking that would be really cool with her and genuinely had no idea why my teacher would leave a voice mail or why both my parents needed to go to the principles office the next morning. I turns out its not OK to tell you teacher her exam is fucking shit and that they think they should stay with native speakers only in the class from that point onward.

&amp;#x200B;

tl;dr told my Enligh teacher her exam was ""Fucking Shit"" because i thought that was the way people speak. got kicked out of the class for the reminder of that year.

 If you have Reddit Ms. Asharov, i'm terribly sorry."
9,"TIFU by not wanting to spend the extra $20 to have an IV removed properly


This happened today. I’ve been out of town for a medical procedure for the past few days and today was check out day. As we are checking out, I find via the magic of google that there is an Asian market in this town. 


When you’re from a relatively small town and you go to larger city, there are certain things you go out of your way to grab. We were on a tight schedule and leaving early the next morning. My husband, being the wonderful man he is, agrees to go on a quest for me to the other side of the city during rush hour to visit an Asian market and grab some hard to find items. Meanwhile, my happy ass decides to take an Uber to the hotel so I can rest. 


Now, I’ve got on long sleeves this whole time, and I’m absolutely freezing. Uber dude is super nice to this sickly woman and cranks up the heat in the car. As I’m finally getting warm, I roll up my sleeves and discover they forgot to take out my IV port. At this point, we are halfway to the hotel and I’m obviously a medical expert by now, there is simply no need to pay the additional $20 or whatever dollars to have him drive back to the hospital. I’ve seen them do this a million times before. 


I grab a bandaid out of my purse and ready myself. Usually there is very little blood when they do this and I’ve got some napkins ready just in case. I pull out the the needle and blood starts coming down my arm, not a ton just more than I was expecting. I grab the napkins and start mopping it up and then I start to feel funny. I’ve never been squeamish before, but the heat, and the red on the napkins were just too much and I blacked out. 


I wake up and Uber dude is FREAKING out, not that I blame him. We are back at the hospital and I didn’t manage to get the bandaid on before blacking out, and there is blood all over the seat in his car. I see the blood on the seat and I black out again. This time when I wake up I’m back in the hospital. 


Another 2 hours of hospital time, a nice tip to poor scared Uber dude, and what I’m sure will be a substantial clean up fee all because I didn’t want to spend the extra $20, which I now need to pay anyway. 

TL;DR Sent husband on a quest for authentic Asian food and didn’t want to wait for him. Took out IV port in an Uber to save $20 on return ride to hospital and end up spending hundreds more. "
10,"TIFU by wanted to smoke weed and ended up getting anal sex [NSFW]


This happened last year before Christmas and I’ve finally come to terms with the set of events that had happened. There were more crazy events leading up to this tournament but I shall save that for another time.

I was part of the debate team in my university in Singapore and my partner and I were representing our university in a few countries in the region. I’m a Malaysian but have been studying in Singapore for a few years. I’ve never really liked the country due to its archaic rules and the way the government forces its people to conform to ridiculous rules. With that said, I love smoking week and having a good time so Singapore was a bit of a headache to live in.

As part of the competition, we were to stay in a hostel with the rest of students competing. It was awesome as I got to meet people of various nationalities and most of them enjoy smoking weed and partying. We went to Cambodia for this tournament and I was looking forward to getting high and having a fun time with new friends. Before I move on, I must let you know about my debate partner. He’s an extremely religious person who frowns up alcohol consumption and drug usage. Sexual activities is a big no-no too. He’s a good lad but his judgmental stares and talks get to me at times.

After the first day, we did fine and went back to the hostel to rest. I met this gorgeous Irish chick and we clicked immediately. After downing a couple of drinks, I went for the move and asked her back to my room(which I shared with my partner). She was giggling and we were on our way. Seeing it was past midnight, I assumed he was fast asleep and there wouldn’t be any issues. I was wrong. He was awake and gave me a dressing down in front of the girl. She was so upset that she left the room and I was stranded with blue balls and a raging urge to murder my partner. 

I was in a rage and left the room, thinking of ways to make the night less sucky. Went out for a smoke and met some Arab students who were taking part in the tournament too. They said they wanted to smoke weed and we decided to try finding some. In my experience with South East Asian countries, the taxi/tuk tuk drivers was the best way to get the supply. We hailed for a tuk tuk right outside the hostel and I asked the driver to bring us to a place where we could get weed. He said it would be 50USD for the weed and 10USD for the ride. Felt it was a bit of a ripoff but the Arab students were way too excited to even negotiate. We got onto the tuk tuk and he brought us to a place about 20 minutes away from the hostel.

Now this place looks dodgy as it was really dark and he was driving us into an alley. For a moment I thought we were about to be robbed but true to his words, he dropped us off and a guy came to pass us the weed. We decided to light up there and it was just less than 5 minutes before 2 police cars came over. The mother fucker tuk tuk driver had sold us out and it was a ploy from the start. The police inspector insisted on bringing us back to the station and getting us locked up and I knew that we could get out of this by giving them what they wanted - money. The Arabs were terrified and it made matters worse. The inspector knew we were inexperienced and demanded 500USD. The Arabs immediately agreed without negotiating again and I was pissed. I told the inspector we had to go back to the hostel to get the money and he brought us back in their car. The Arabs decided on splitting it 4 ways and I had to cough up 125USD. I only had 300USD with me and it was really maddening. Paid up and I went to the rooftop in more anger.

Feeling frustrated, I needed a drink badly and decided to walk out to find a truck bar- a bar serving drinks out of the back of a truck and there were make shift seats nearby. Drinks were really cheap - 1USD a pint and I had a good time. Was never really a good drinker but the cheap prices got to me and I must have downed about 10 pints. Was too smashed and ended up sleeping on the road and woke up in the morning only to realise I missed my debate preliminary session. Partner was pissed but I assured him that we could make it up the next day.

I spent the day practising our material before heading out in the evening to the truck bar again. Once again, was smashed but this time a girl approached me and started flirting with me. Hormones took over and I followed her to a hotel for a fun time. I was really drunk but was feeling excited to get laid when disaster struck. She said I had to pay her 50USD for sex and the room. She was a working girl and I was duped! Feeling frustrated and horny, I decided to pay her and waited for her to shower. The alcohol kicked in and I ended up falling asleep. Fuck my life.

The calamity didn’t end there. When I got up, I realised my wallet and phone were missing. The girl had pilfered them without mercy. Immediately went to the counter and they couldn’t speak a word of English. Felt like strangling myself for being an idiot. I used their phone to contact my partner to pick me up and oh boy was he pissed. At this point we couldn’t proceed further in the tournament and had to give up since we were disqualified. My partner wasn’t talking to me and I was having a roller coaster of emotions - both agony and anger. 

I decided to leave my partner alone not to frustrate him further and walked the streets trying to find some solace. Saw another one of those truck bars and decided to get drunk before heading back to Singapore. I got wicked smashed again and another girl approached me. I straight up told her I had no money, not even 10USD left after paying for my drinks. She smiled and flirted with me and I was charmed. She brought me to her house and I was too drunk to resist.

All I remembered was laying in her bed before passing out. While sleeping, I kept having vivid dreams of taking a massive dump on the bed. It was weird but that was all I could remember. The nightmare started when I woke up.

Groggily, I woke up and I was naked on the bed. My arse felt like it was on fire and in immense hurt. I could barely move. Turning over, I saw her naked too, with a penis bigger than mine. Immediately, I was awake and my mind went blank. I saw some used condoms on the night stand next to her and quickly put on my clothes, speechless. She tried to talk to me but I was gone. I didn’t know how to even react or think. Quickly took a tuk tuk back to my hostel feeling devastated.

Didn’t speak a word about it to anyone and just went home. I went to a clinic few weeks later to get myself tested and was researching how to live with HIV should I contract it. Thank God I was clean and tried to block the entire incident from my head. Ended up going for school-sponsored therapy sessions and it helped a lot. I just graduated 2 weeks ago and wanted to share my story. 

Lads if you’re going to Cambodia, skip the truck bars.

TL;DR: Wanted to get weed, ended up drunk and fucked in the butt by a transsexual."
