0,"TIFU by sending nudes to my employee group chat.


TLDR at the bottom- 

Well I recently started a new job about 5-6 months ago, doing some tech work (trying not to be too specific). With that being said I‚Äôm pretty young, 24, definitely the youngest that works there why far. I also mostly work with other men, 30-40. 

We have a GroupMe for the store I work at, which includes the owner, the manager and 5-6 other employees.
The previous night I had been feeling a little frisky and desired to take some pictures/videos for the guy that I was with at the time. No biggie right? 
The next morning I had work, go in as normal, pretty busy day actually. Noon rolls around and I needed to post a picture to the groupme about a issue I was having with a computer I was working on. 
I typed what I needed to said clicked the camera roll icon and just as I clicked the picture, a customer came up and started asking me a question, I hit send without thinking and go on about my day. I should also probably say that by this time I was working alone and closing so no one else was around. The customer who came in kept me pretty busy for 30-45 mins, when they finally left I went to check my phone and saw I had a bunch of missed calls from my boss... at first I thought he was just calling me about the question I had, while the phone was ringing, I went back to look at the groupme, to my horror I CLICKED NOT JUST A PICTURE FROM THE NIGHT BEFORE, BUT THE WHOLE DAMN VIDEO. My heart dropped, instantly when I realized what happened my boss picked up the phone, he began questioning me about what my ‚Äúintentions‚Äù where with the video and that he‚Äôs never had anyone do such a disrespectful act in the company before. I tried to explain but needless to say that was my last day working there. Lol on the bright side the coworker I had a crush on...finally got his attention. ü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èüòÇ 


TLDR: tried to send a picture of a customers problem to my employee groupme, turns out I send an entire nude video of myself, still got the guy in the end! "

2,"TIFU by putting a googly eye in my ear 12 years ago and realising its still there today...


When I was 7 ,about 12 years ago, me and a few of my buddies here playing pretend as spies on the bus home from school. So spy's have the cool invisible speaker in their ears to contact people and I thought it would be a good idea to use a googly eye that  I had lifted from school in the place of this speaker.
The googly eye idea worked perfectly for a minute until I had pressed it too far into my ear and in trying to grab it out I pushed it even further in. I was kind of worried at this point and decided to ask my big cousin, who was on the bus, if she could get it but she said you couldn't see it in my ear. I could hear it rattling and it was very annoying but being too scared to tell my dad, I stupidly decided to let it be for the time being. After a few days it stopped rattling and i assumed it had fell out and that was the end of that...

Skip forward to this Tuesday;
I do kayaking at university and got a big slap on the head with a paddle and I was submerged under water, after I emerged and pulled my boat out I could hear a slight rattle in my ear and I knew instantly what it was.
It's now Friday and the rattling happens every time I turn my head and I still haven't build up the nerve to go to the doctor and confess my unusual prosthesis.

TLDR: Put googly eye in ear 12 years ago, thought googly fell out shortly after... It didn't"
3,"TIFU by completely surrendering to the best orgasm I‚Äôve ever had.


This happened last night, but you get the point. 

I ended a five year relationship with my ex-fianc√© about six months ago. I have been casually dating a guy for about two months now and last night we finally had sex.

I haven‚Äôt had sex in almost two years. The relationship with my ex was dead long before he finally moved out. And this man was dicking me down properly. That feeling was building up and I knew I was about to cum. Hard. I told him and he said the perfect response and there was just no holding back. 

I start to orgasm, he tells me to look him in the eyes, it‚Äôs intense and I fart. I don‚Äôt mean a little toot that we both could politely ignore. It had so much volume and body to it and every time my insides were contracting, it took a split second break before unleashing again. It was horrifying. 

Once I could focus my eyes again after having such an intense orgasm, I look up at him and he‚Äôs avoiding eye contact while staying completely still. I don‚Äôt know why I thought this would make it less awkward, but I said ‚Äúuh...excuse you.‚Äù Because honestly it was such a masculine fart I thought he would think it was kind of funny that it came from me. But nope, he just gave me a very short and incredibly forced laugh and got up from the bed. He didn‚Äôt even get to cum.

He left and I haven‚Äôt heard from him at all. He‚Äôs been texting me before he goes to sleep, when he wakes up, random times throughout the day and today it‚Äôs been dead silent. Unlike the fart I ripped last night. 

We‚Äôre both in our thirties. Farts happen. I probably shouldn‚Äôt have tried to make a stupid joke immediately after. 

TL;DR
I haven‚Äôt had sex in almost two years. Finally have sex with a man I really, really like, it‚Äôs amazing, and I rip ass as I‚Äôm cumming. Then I make a very stupid joke. Now he isn‚Äôt speaking to me. 

And just a tiny bonus story. Someone wrote a comment under a post and it truly made me laugh and I needed that laugh after humiliating myself. I tried to give that comment gold. I‚Äôve never done it before and I ended up giving gold to the comment below him. Which was a stupid fucking comment. 

Anyway, hope you guys are having a better start to the week than I am. Try not to fart on the balls of your new love interest.

4,"TIFU by not reading a Tinder Bio


Alright, so this happened ""yesterday"" so its technically  YIFU. But whatever. 

So, a couple weeks ago i was swiping on el tinder when i saw a cute goth girl. Lets call her Lizzie. Anyways, i was fairly tired at that moment and only glanced over the bio. This was the fuckup. 

Lizzie and i match and get to talking. She is really nice, into the same nerdy shit i am, a fantastic shitposter, good conversationalist. and Very,Very cute. I'm thinking she is already my next girlfriend assuming things go well when we meet.

Couple days later we go on the date. Now, I've been catfished before, so I'm already expecting that she won't be as cute as she was online. Nope. She shows up looking fantastic. (Just like in the simulations!) We get sushi and are having a good time, so we decide to go back to my place. 

 After a drink, some anime and good conversation, we start making out. Things are getting...heavy so we go into my room, she takes off my pants and starts giving me head. Awesome.  She took off her bra, not flat chested either, double awesome. (BIG TITTY GOTH GF REEEE) Anyways I'm not the type to keep a girl waiting on her knees. So i ask her to get on the bed and we make out some more and i go to take off her skirt. The next few moments were something like this:

""Uhh... whatcha got there..?""

""Oh my god i thought you knew""

*windows shutdown noice as my boner collapses*

""..nope. I had no clue""

Soooooo, she had a dick. Turns out, she did say she was trans in her bio. Pre op.  Been on hormones for a while and is going to make the switch. I didn't freak out immediately. We ended up getting dressed, knocking back a few more shots and exchanging life stories until she sobered up and went home. Ended up friends after all was said and done. 

Always. Read. Bios.

TLDR: didn't read a tinder bio, got my dick sucked by a pre op trans girl, found out she had a dick. "
5,"TIFU by forgetting I pranked my friend and accidentally giving him mild depression


Mandatory this didn't happen today, but rather a few years ago...

Back when I was at Uni my best friend (James) and I used to always try prank each other creatively by getting on each other's Facebooks/social media. Think things like messaging our friends with odd messages like they are trying to sell them a ridiculous pyramid scheme , changing each other's profile picture, etc... you get the idea.

One day near the end of my final year, we are in his room about to go for a night out and James goes to the bathroom, leaving his laptop unlocked (with facebook logged in). I take this as my opportunity to execute my latest master plan - I was going to change his post settings on facebook to ""only me"" (i.e. his posts would be invisible to anyone else) and post something outrageous and completely inappropriate (knowing he has his family on facebook). Plan was that he would come in, see the post and freak out / get super pissed, for me to reveal the gaff to him and have a laugh.

However, I only managed to execute the first part of my plan (i.e. changing the setting to ""only me"") before he came back into the room, and I had to quickly exit facebook to avoid being found out.

Now, the fuck up was that we went out, got quite drunk, came back home, and I COMPLETELY forgot about this prank. Fast forward to almost a year later...

My friend is still at Uni (doing a masters degree) while I have moved to another city and started working. I should add that James is a big time electric guitar player, and in the last year got into recording videos of himself and post them on youtube / social media. He messages me one day asking what I thought of his latest video on facebook. I went to his page and noticed there was no post... in fact, there were no posts for around a year...

I tell him there's no post, to which he says that can't be, I posted it yesterday and am looking at the post now. I'm on the phone with him when it suddenly just \*clicks\* and I am immediately MORTIFIED - This entire time, I had left the ""only me"" setting on, and he hadn't realised. I hang up to compose myself before calling him back and telling him the truth.

For the last year or so, he had been posting several videos and had received 0 likes or comments. He had taken most of his previous videos down, had wondered why nobody liked his videos, if people just hated him since most of his friends graduated, if he was really crap at guitar... One thing he told me in particular was particularly heart-breaking - ""I often layed awake at night thinking about this"". I don't want to use the term depression too loosely, but it really affected him and he considered going for counselling.

Luckily he was good about it and didn't hold a grudge, and we now laugh about it. Bought him a lot of drinks next time I saw him though.

TL;DR  Forgot I changed my friend's facebook settings so that nobody else could see his posts, he thought nobody liked him and was mildly depressed for a year."
6,"TIFU by being too good at my job


So this has happened over the last month and half coming to a head yesterday.

&amp;#x200B;

I started a new job, admin, about a month and a half ago. I do pretty basic administrative work: check deposits, filing, follow ups, etc. It's a full time gig, and it might take me HALF of the day to do all my duties. I don't know who had this job last, but they fucked around A LOT. I try to fuck around and I still get things done SUPER fast. This has led to frustration for me and my supervisor because I run out of things to do, and I have to interrupt her work so she can find things for me to do.

&amp;#x200B;

Btw, I am not the kind of person where I enjoy getting paid to do nothing. Sure, it's nice on occasion, but not half of the day every single day.

&amp;#x200B;

Fast forward to yesterday: I ask my supervisor if there was anything I could work on, and she asks me to shut her door. She asks me how I feel about getting my hours cut. Not just by a few hours. She's thinking me being there 25 HOURS PER WEEK! That's significant.

&amp;#x200B;

Moral of the story: don't do your best because you will get punished for it.

&amp;#x200B;

tl:dr I did my job too well and got my hours cut for it"
7,"TIFU by going commando


**For the record: the girl I'm seeing encouraged me to create an actual account to share this fuck up. I have read some crazy ass stories on here so, uh, it's hard to tell if this post will even come close to the standard of this sub.** 

*Shrug.*

This happened last weekend. 

I went to my friend's house party wearing nothing but my panda onesie. I thought underwear would be overkill since it gets so damn hot in that thing. So, I eliminated the unnecessary layers and went commando. Oof. It was freeing. The penis was a swingin' and the balls was a breathin'. Pure cock flopping fun I tell thee. And so... off I go... with a hop and skip... and a bouncing dick. 

Cut to me and this cute girl grinding on the dance floor. Her ass was rubbing against me so fucking hard, it triggered **the boner.** Aw, fuuuck! It's gonna stick out like a sore thumb underneath this damn onesie. I literally spin her ass around so it doesn't touch my dick no more. Worst. Fucking. Mistake.¬† This girl, in the heat of the moment, rips open my onesie, exposing my bare boner for all to see. As if that wasn't bad enough, my dick fucking flexes right before I cover up. Folks there lost their shit. Dick jokes, drunken laughter, cat-calls &amp; whistles, all erupted in that moment. I questioned so many life choices as I stood there, frozen and flustered as fuck. 

For the rest of that night I had to dodge a mob of wasted degenerates on a mission to rip me open. The motherfuckers called it the Panda Challenge.

**TL;DR I went commando and ended up partying so hard my penis popped out and joined the fun in front of everyone.**"
8,"TIFU by not wearing underwear to work


This definitely happened today, though I wish it hadn‚Äôt. 

A bit of backstory, this morning the apartments fire alarm went off so we all had to clear out for a bit. In my haste, I skipped putting on underwear. 

I decided to take a nap a while later and when I woke up, I decided to just go to work without remedying the underwear situation. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs only a 5 hour shift,‚Äù I thought. It‚Äôll be fine. 

I get to work, everything is fine. Happy hour starts, we‚Äôre prepared for the worst. I‚Äôm sipping my water in the back briefly and reach down to adjust myself.

Imagine my horror when I touch my entire ballsack.  I‚Äôve never been so alarmed to touch my own balls. My pants, at some point, had ripped clean down the middle and The Bois‚Ñ¢ were out out about. 

I had to explain that I was having a wardrobe emergency and ran to call my roommate who thankfully showed up with a new pair of pants and underwear. It was a long 45 minutes that I just had to pretend my balls weren‚Äôt enjoying the draft. 

TL;DR I didn‚Äôt put on underwear, pants ripped at work and my balls enjoyed some brief freedom. "
9,"TIFU by encouraging my husband in bed and ruining sex for the day NSFW


So as usual, this wasn't today but last weekend.
After a busy workweek where me and my husband had been coming home, and pretty much passing out at the end of the day, we figured a Saturday afternoon would be the perfect time for some quality alone time.
I'd been teasing him for the morning whilst we did general household chores and finally dragged him upstairs mid afternoon to get down to business! 
Everything started off brilliantly, the clothes got thrown, things got hot and quickly lead into some excellent 69ing.
Now, my husband is deft of finger and pretty quickly had me moaning with pleasure and a very intense orgasm. 
We quickly switched to him on top and i was encouraging him to go harder so that he could have a great finish as well. Still all good so far! I continued to egg him on, telling him to step up his game and FINISH HIM. (no body slam moves required)
....
After a particularly enthusiastic thrust I suddenly got a stab of pain in my side, making me curl up in agony. He mistook this for intense pleasure (apparently my pain face is similar to my sexy face? Not sure how to take that one!) and kept going for a couple more plunges before it finally became obvious to him as I burst into tears!

This lead into him panicking that he'd somehow broken me with his cock (he may be overestimating there) and me trying to figure out WTF had just happened and why I was crying. I'm guessing it something to do with the lovely stabbing cramps in my right hand side of my abdomen. Possibly.
Cue the naked running around as he grabs hot water bottle and glass of water while I curl up on the bed, now very lacking in sex appeal.

Turns out that if you have PCOS (polycystic ovary syndrome), 'enthusiastic exercise' can sometimes cause a ovarian cyst to get over excited and burst! 

Worst part was, we were trying to fit in this fun time before his parents came over for dinner and now, 20 minutes before they arrive am now stuck in an ungainly position on the bed, totally starkers for all to see. 
I had to phone his mum to ask if she had any ibuprofen she could bring round for me as we had none in the house and then had to try and explain exactly why I needed them. Luckily she had the sense to not ask any further questions when i said it can be triggered by certain types of exercise.

Managed to get husband to help me pull some clothes on moments before they arrived, so saved some of my dignity at last.
He's now convinced his dick is cursed and is going to break me again.

TL;DR- Top thrust, cyst bust! "
10,"TIFU when I ADJUSTED my bra in front of a cute guy.


I am cringing while writing this. I was going to a library to study (I‚Äôm in college, yay ) and I saw this cute guy as I‚Äôm walking in. I was thinking ‚Äúhot damn, he fine‚Äù but I didn‚Äôt think he saw me so I sat down at a table that was empty. It‚Äôs early morning on a Friday, so no one was there. I was in a rush to leave dorms, so my bra was not fitting right at all-TMI but basically only 40% of my left boob was actually in the bra.

Since the library room I was in was basically empty I had the bright idea to, with both hands, grab my bra (through my shirt, don‚Äôt worry)and hitch it up. I can‚Äôt exaggerate this enough-this was not a sly fixing of the strap, or a gentle adjusting of a side boob: I was fondling myself. 

Literally as I am grabbing my breasts, the cute boy, who was still deciding where to sit, chose to walk back in my direction and saw the whole thing, which I only realized when I looked up.

Then he chose to sit next to me? I don‚Äôt know why? Do boys find girls who viciously yank at their bras in libraries on Friday mornings attractive? But I was so embarrassed at this point, and my face was hot, so I didn‚Äôt even look at him. He kept sneaking glances at me, and I have NO IDEA what he was thinking. That I was psycho? That he had to sit in that seat because it was too late to turn back? I don‚Äôt know. 

Anyway, to add to this, my stomach kept rumbling in the quiet library. It‚Äôs at that point that I decided I had to get out of there, and of course I tripped as I tried to stand. Anyway. That‚Äôs me. This is my life. Thoughts? Comments? Help? 

TLDR: a cute boy in a library saw me trying to stuff my boobs back into my bra. "
11,"TIFU by accidentally dating a straight guy online as a straight guy (yes you read it properly)


For context, this happened a couple days ago.

I've recently gone through a shit breakup and it's been about a month now. I am still getting the breakup symptoms (life won't get better, that kind of shit) so I searched up how to recover after a breakup. After using my own flawed judgement, I determined all these sites were full of fucking crap and decided, that the best way to recover from this breakup, was to date other people and move on from her. I thought of ways to do this. After sitting on my bed for 5 minutes and staring at the ceiling I realized that:

Yeah. . . girls that I know in real life. Welp, that count is about ZERO!

I thought of places to look. Maybe. . . online dating?

Now I use reddit a lot. So out of pure desperation, I went on the [r/r4r](https://www.reddit.com/r/r4r) subreddit. I initially thought that this subreddit was full of desperate guys, and not going to lie, it kinda is. All I had to really do to see that was scroll down in that subreddit. In a way, it was kinda relieving seeing that I wasn't the only desperate guy out there.

However, one post, a female around my age looking for a male (to date) struck my attention. Immediately I noticed she had the same interests as me, I noticed a couple other guys DMed her so I decided to as well. We hit it up. She really sparked my interest as someone who I'd date. I asked if she had any other social media. She said she only had twitter. I only had instagram. I asked if she had Discord since she mentioned in our dms that she gamed a little. She said yes and we moved our conversation to Discord.

Our conversation was going really well. I'd been texting her for about 2-3 hours. Eventually, it got to the point where I wanted to see she looked like. She mutually wanted to see what I looked like. We decided to share pictures of ourselves at the exact same time.

Well shit. You know where this is going :/

We both hit submit at the same time. To my shock, I saw some dude with a beard.

I was so fucking CONFUSED! WHAT?!

He just told me 'like wtf I thought you were a girl'. I told him I thought he was a girl since THATS WHAT HE SAID IN HIS POST. He sorta realized this, and then proceeded to brush it off with an oops. I wasn't that pissed or anything. I was just kinda shocked since I had been texting him like, as if he was a girl (guys you know what I'm talking about right?). We were both rather dumbfounded. I asked him if he wanted to stay friends, since he had really similar interests. He said sure. We talked for about 5 minutes. Eventually he says this to me:

""Look man. I started this shit thinking you were a girl. It's really awkward knowing your not a girl, so I think we shouldn't be friends.""

Well shit mate. You don't have to tell me twice.

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR; Got over a breakup, so being hella desperate I met someone who I thought was a girl online without me or them seeing a picture of one another. We chatted for about 3 hours, only to discover we were both guys. I asked to be friends but he then blocked me. "
12,"TIFU by sending my son to school in his pajamas because I had misread ‚ÄúPi Day‚Äù as ‚ÄúPj Day‚Äù in a school email.


Let‚Äôs start off by saying I‚Äôm a single dad and my son is in kindergarten. His teacher sent out a message yesterday that said ‚ÄúTomorrow for Pi day we have a parent bringing in a snack.‚Äù I had only glanced at it. Ten minutes later, I got a message from my son‚Äôs mom asking if I have a matching set of Pjs for him to wear. I replied yes, and then never looked at the teacher‚Äôs email again.  

Fast forward to this morning, and I dress my boy in his favorite Pjs and take him to school. As I approach, I notice that no one else is wearing Pjs and my son is trotting around in bright red spider man pajama pants. So I get him to the door of the school, send him in, and immediately pull my phone out to look at the email. I had to read it twice before I noticed that it didn‚Äôt say ‚ÄúPj Day‚Äù at all, but fucking ‚ÄúPi Day!‚Äù 

So I sent an email to his teacher explaining the mix up and asked her to make him feel comfortable today. She said she glossed it over with the other kids and made it a non issue. Luckily, they are only 5-year-olds in kindergarten with little self awareness. 

So sorry, son! Here‚Äôs a little lesson on being different!!

TL;DR - Sent my son to school in his pajamas because I had misread ‚ÄúPi Day‚Äù as ‚ÄúPj Day‚Äù in a school email. His teacher made it a non issue in class and it didn‚Äôt scar my son for life, hopefully.

13,"TIFU by making Indian food and making the same mistake 78% of people make whilst impressing girls with dinner.


Throwaway because she knows my reddit handle but this happened about 1h30 mins ago. Buckle up because it turned out kinda long. 

&amp;#x200B;

So I've been seeing a nice, athletic and 100% my-type lady for almost a month - nothing too serious, though. It was her birthday on Tuesday, but she never mentioned it to me and I don't really dabble in the social media shitshow, so I didn't know until she mentioned she'd been snowboarding for it. She didn't want me to make a big fuss because we're still kinda fresh and she had to work, so I said I'd take her out for dinner at the weekend (aka today) and that was that. Flashback to last night, she said she'd rather me make her my favourite ""British"" food for dinner and we can watch a movie at my apartment. All good.

&amp;#x200B;

So flash forward to today. I'm a Brit, living on the West Coast of Canada, and finding authentic Indian food is hard because everywhere I go seems to be super whitewashed. So great lightbulb idea, lets make her biryani! As a human milk bottle, I will still toot my own horn whenever I have the opportunity to make Indian food so it seemed like the best food to impress. 

&amp;#x200B;

So I made biryani about 4h ago. She said she didn't like cardamom pods, cloves or cassia bark, so I picked them out of the pre-mixed mix (I mix the mix every couple of months so I don't have to measure each time) and decided to add some red chilli peppers just to add a bit of flavour. Those small but very lethal fuckers. Obviously, this includes slicing them.

&amp;#x200B;

Just as a side note: I'm female and I know how bad it feels when you get that tingly burning feeling on your tinka winka. I have also read 10s of TIFU's where we're all just trying our best to please the lady in our lives and it ends up with mt Vesuvius vagina. Thirdly, I've done it before, to myself, and it's rough. To combat this, I washed my hands literally 12 times thinking it would be ok. 

&amp;#x200B;

So we ate dinner about 3.5h ago and put on a movie. Once we'd finished eating, one thing obviously led to another, the sofa was reclined and fun was being had. The fun lasted less than 5 minutes before she mentioned that her Pompeii pussy was on fire and went to soak in the bath for 1h. We both found it hilarious at the time, but she left 20 minutes ago with a yogurt vag and has yet to text me. I apologized a lot so I'm sure she'll come round.

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR: Made Indian food, spices lingered on my fingers, put fingers into hot potential girlfriend, hot potential girlfriend got Pompeii pussy and went home with a yogurt vagina. "
14,"TIFU by having a spontaneous road-trip with my wife


Never will I ever be this spontaneous again. It's weekend and we wanted to spend time together. For some reason we really felt spontaneous this particular day and decided to go to Paris just to see the Eiffel tower. We live in Belgium and it was a 4 hour trip, but we were really determined.

We even like the cool, spontaneous couple at this point and the trip there was good, I even mentioned that it's the journey that matter to me and the fact we did go through with it. I was seeing it as a weekend road-trip and everything was going good, but keep im mind I did not google or do any looking up as we didn't really use our phones much this weekend.

Once we got into France the landscape was beautiful and full of nature and long fields like u see on the windows default background, but ten times more amazing.

HOWEVER

Once we actually started heading into Paris things started to become more city-like and not the good kind. The roads were bad and the traffic started becoming quite aggressive. I just thought it was probably because of the weekend, but the deeper into Paris we went the worse it got.

Then IT happened. We had arrived at what I now know is the ""Arc de Triomphe"".

This was no longer traffic, but a free for all; the likes of which I had never seen before. I was dazed, confused and scared. Drivers all over were just going like a beehive. Pushing in quite aggressively and just taking charger not giving a crap wether they were going to get hit or not. I was driving a rental, so I was worried I would get hit.

Just to paint you a clear picture, Imagine a HUGE field; maybe the size of a small football field. Now imagine no road-signs, no traffic lights, no ground-indicators or even lanes. It's an 8 lane round-about with no lanes...

The worse thing is the entirety of Paris seems to be in this state, the chaos and aggressive driving. I started noticing one in every four car had a huge dent. I had legit never ever seen something this terrifying before. The only way to describe traffic in Paris is a free for all, first come first served and taking a lot of risk and chances.

When I finally had cleared this monstrosity I was so relieved, but then my second TIFU happened right after. As I pulled out of the Arc, I noticed bricks everywhere; about 10 cop riot cars and protesters everywhere. The street legit looked like there had been a huge explosion, tear gas on the streets and everything was broken. My partner and I were both in awe. We didn't know what we were looking at.

Apparently there was a huge riot going on and according to the french the most aggressive riot ever. They are calling it the yellow jacket riots and we were not suppose to even be there. The french president is holding everyone there responsible for the damages. At that point we simply were too scared to even stay there anymore, we turned the car around and I was desperately looking for any other way out of there besides the Arc, but to my shock I was forced to drive back on the Arc.

Good news, I made it; no damage to the car or ourselves; but we did decide to look into cities we want to visit before going next time.

TL;DR Drove a 4 hour trip to Paris in a spontaneous moment and ended up being shocked by it's chaotic traffic and also ended up in the middle of a huge aggressive riot."
15,"TIFU by telling a police officer. ""I don't give a fuck bitch, send the whole police force to my house.""


This was years ago when you could pump gas at the gas station and then pay after.

At this time I worked over night security. I had two vehicles registered in my name. One I drove and the other my sister drove. For some reason I was getting prank calls during a two week period. I would always get calls at 1 or 2 am. After a while it was very annoying. 

One night I got a call a little after 2am. It went something like this.
Me: What!?
P.O: Hi this is Officer Jones from the (redacted) police department. 
Me: Oh really??
P.O: Yes we have footage of you stealing gas from the gas station. 
Me: Oh is that right? You have footage of me stealing gas?
P.O: Yes, this is a serious matter, we ran your plates and the vehicle is registered to you. 
Me: Oh sure you did. Whatever man do what you gotta do.
P.O: I don't think you understand the severity of this situation. 
Me: I don't think you understand that I don't give a fuck.
P.O: I will send officers to your house right now.
Me: Please do bitch.
P.O: Ok, I tried to explain the severity of this situation to you respectfully. 
Me: Why are you still talking? I don't give a fuck bitch, send the whole police force to my house. (Click!)

Not much longer after that, my sister calls me. She tells me the cops are at our house looking for me. At that time I'm like what the fuck? Then I start putting two and two together. My sister at the time had a druggy piece of shit boyfriend who would often drive her car. Then it dawned on me that he was the one stealing gas in my other car. I tell my sister that it's obviously him that stole the gas. 
Remember that whole stop snitchin' campaign? Well my sister was all about that. She would not admit her dumb ass boyfriend did anything. 

After I get off the phone with my sister. Office Jones calls back and I change my tune real quick. I explain that I had no idea he was a real cop and I apologized for calling him a bitch ect. I then explain that my sister's asshole boyfriend is the one who they should be looking for. I tell him I am definitely at work with my other car and can get any verification that he needs. 

Did they end up finding my sister's boyfriend? Yes, but only because he was arrested for a robbery a couple of days later.

TLDR, I thought I got a prank call saying I stole gas and told a police officer to send the whole police force to my house. They sent officers and I realized my sister's druggy boyfriend stole gas while I was at work.

16,"TIFU by saying ""The N Word"" at an African American childs birthday party. (I'm white)


So I'm currently still at the birthday party where this incident took place. We are at a birthday party for one of my wife's friends' kid who just turned 2. The whole family of the child is here and they are a black family. Now I'm talking aunt's, uncle's, grandparents, family friends, the works. The birthday girl was playing with a balloon and my son (almost 2) took the balloon away and started yelling No! No! No! So naturally I took the balloon away from him and the family was staring at him being a brat naturally. So in an attempt to not say ""no"" and sort of explain his behavior I said, ""sorry everyone he just recently learned the 'N' word"".......the room went silent......I also have never met ANY of these people before so it made my mistake that much more awkward. Luckily they all just started dying laughing because they understood what I meant. 


TL;DR In an attempt to avoid using the word ""No"" I told an African American family my son recently learned the 'N' word. It was embarrassing then everyone laughed."
17,"TIFU by sitting next to Mao


I currently am living in China for a year teaching English at a University. The University has a giant statue of Mao in the center that serves as a great meeting point for friends. 

A friend of mine and I planned dinner today and decided to meet at Mao. I arrived a little early, and I knew she always takes a little longer, so I popped a squat on the steps beside the towering statue. While on my phone, I heard someone come up behind me. They made some noise but I ignored them until I heard a pointed *Hello* (well, it was a loud Ni Hao). I turned around, prepared to tell this guy that I was waiting for a friend, but it was a campus security guard. I hopped to my feet.

The guy seemed kinda nice, started off by trying to assess how good my Mandarin is (it's good enough, but not great), and asking me a few questions: if I was a student there, where I was from, what I was doing. I gave all the answers in my best Mandarin, there's a little bit I couldn't get across and a few words from him that I didn't know.

Then, he told he wanted to learn English. That's fine, too; I hear that from a lot of the people I meet. He started telling me the phrases he knows in English. *Stop! Hands up! Get down on the ground and don't move!* all said in a very authoritative tone. I started to freak out a little, but I figured it would be incredibly rude to take out my phone and ask my friend to hurry up. I smiled and told him his English was really good.

Then he points to Mao. In Mandarin, he tells me, *this is a very important man. You can't sit near him, especially with your back to him. That's incredibly disrespectful.* 

I started freaking out a little more. I'd seen people sitting there before, but when I got there the area was pretty deserted. It was just me, the security guard, and Mao. I started preparing my *forgive me, I'm a stupid foreigner speech* (a friend taught me how to say ""I'm begging you"" in Mandarin and if ever there was a time to use it...)

Right then, my friend turned the corner. I gave a quick *thanks, bye!* to the security guard and bolted. 

Next time, I'll stand.

TL;DR: I made a fatal faux pas by sitting next to a statue of Chairman Mao. A security guard came up to me and, after demonstrating a few fear-inducing English phrases, told me I was being super disrespectful. I didn't know where to go from that, but then my friend showed up and I ran. Don't sit next to Mao.

18,"TIFU by putting on music during sex


My husband and I were doing some sexy roleplay, with me fully outfitted in a French maid costume. The atmosphere was perfect: everything was getting hot and heavy, and he decided it was time to make some real moves on me. I put on some music in the background - whatever youtube recommended, and it was on autoplay. 

The time came when he looked at me with a devilish glint in his eyes (I promise you this much detail is necessary) and asked what I thought he was about to make me do. ""you?"" I said, sheepishly, as he pushed my down to my knees and started undoing his belt. At that EXACT moment, the peaceful atmospheric music (which it turns out was Hans Zimmer and Radiohead's ""Ocean Bloom""), Thom Yorke croons out ""Ooopeeen your mouth wiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiide"" 

And that was it. We collapsed on top of each other in a fit of uncontrollable laughter for about 5 minutes, boners dead, crying, and short of breath. Never again will I mix radiohead with regular head.

TL;DR - tried to do sexy roleplay, moment ruined by Thom Yorke telling me to open my mouth wiiiiiiiiiide"
19,"TIFU by trying to have sex with my gf before I had to drop her off


To start it off, my girlfriend came down from NY and today was the morning she had to leave. I woke up horny AF and you know..we only have a 25 mins or so (include time to clean up the hotel and get ready) to go at it.  Well, we start to get at it with about 15 mins to spare...couldn't finish  in time so we bounced out reallllll quick to meet the train for her. 

&amp;#x200B;

Boner has just been sitting there for quite some time since it's all I could think about this morning, and....look at this....my gas tank  is basically empty. BUT there's, thankfully, a gas station right next door to the train station. So, boner still on-deck, I dip into the gas station and have to have the guy come over since it's a full-service town. Of course I couldn't find my wallet so I had to turn to my back seat to reach into my bag. There it is!! However, my pants moved a bit and my boner came loose and the bulge is just staring out like Danny Devito in a onesie. 

&amp;#x200B;

The gas attendant comes by before I could fix anything and looks down to hand me my card. Notices a bulge just staring out and gives me the dirtiest look. Takes a pause and says ""That Fireball in my car isn't looking too bad right now.""

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR: Gas attendant saw my overdue boner and I forced him to drink at 7:30AM."
