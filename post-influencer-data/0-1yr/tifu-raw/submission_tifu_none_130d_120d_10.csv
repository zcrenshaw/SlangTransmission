0,"TIFU by accidentally getting sexual with my dentist, again.


I'm a 32 year old woman who can never go back to my new dentist after two visits because I'm an idiot. 

My dentist is a very nice and professional man. Our first appointment was going pretty smoothly until he made some innocuous remark about us ""being strangers."" My immediate reply was ""oh, you're not a stranger! You've been inside of my mouth for 20 minutes!"" I did NOT intend to make a sexual joke. His face turned red and he was clearly embarrassed but he continued on like a true professional and we were probably both relieved when the appointment was over. 

I had my second dentist appointment today. I actually mentally prepared myself to be a model patient who didn't say anything weird, thank you very much. He had been working in my mouth for about 5 minutes when he started to seem really uncomfortable or something. His face was red and he was breathing a little heavier. I was a bit concerned and also confused. Like how could I have embarrassed him this time? I had hardly spoken! So he keeps working in there and then I realize what the hell is happening. My dentist was wearing grape flavored gloves. I had been absentmindedly licking his fingers the whole time. 

Never going back.

TL;DR  Today I fucked up by licking my dentist"
1,"TIFU by asking Reddit which ethnic group to exterminate


Today I had been looking forward to the qualifying for the Formula 1 this weekend, and was browsing Reddit whilst also watching some older Formula 1 footage on YouTube. So it got me wondering, “Some of these races used to really get me super excited for them, now they’re just boring and far too controlled”. So I posed the question to /r/Formula1 to ask their opinions also. Shortly after posting, it transpired that the way I had asked the question could be perceived as...A little...’Hitlerish’. Check out the link below ~~smash that subscri~~. It somehow grabbed the attention of many people, and managed to get to #1 of /r/all and now my inbox is broken. Unfortunately for me, I am very anally retentive with things such as e-mails, texts, etc. that I must open every single one. It would actually play on my mind so badly that I wouldn’t be able to sleep if I didn’t open them, so I must open and read EVERY GODDAMN COMMENT. Probably the worst thing to have to feel the need to do if you plan on making it to the front page. I thought it was slowing down, because it got to a point where I was reading messages faster than they were coming, and the number of notifications was going down. But then, ~everything changed when the fire nat~~ USA woke up. And I’ve been playing catch-up ever since. Took an opportunity to make this post since the message count was less than 100. Let’s see what I go back to now...

TL;DR - Made a post asking a question, worded it wrong and now everyone thinks I’m a racist bastard."
2,"TIFU by taking LSD and pretending to be French for 10 months


Throwaway for reasons.
TL;DR at the bottom.

So this was more of a FU that happened quite a while ago which only just caught up to me a few weeks ago, so also not today.

About 11 months ago I moved into a new house as a temporary sort of thing until I could get the money together to sort something out properly, I was hoping to have already moved out by this point. On my second day after I’d finished unpacking I decided to break the house in with a nice acid trip, I’d brought some with me that I’d recently bought but not had the chance to use yet.

Things were going well with the trip but then it seemed to be getting really intense and I quickly realised that the tabs were much stronger than I had been told they were, and I thought being locked up in the unfamiliar house wasn’t helping me relax. So I figured the best thing to do to relax would be to go for a stroll because I was starting to get pretty overwhelmed at that point. 

So I left the house to start my walk and my next door neighbour happened to be just arriving at the same time. It’s a street of tightly packed terraced houses so next door’s door is about one meter away from mine. I’d not met anybody on my street yet and didn’t realise this was a friendly tight-knit community where people talk to each other. She said something along the lines of “hello nice to meet you, my name’s (her name), are you new to the area?”

So basically I do this thing sometimes when people try to sell me things on the street etc where I pretend I can’t speak English. I remember a few words from my GCSE French so I just say some nonsense sentences and then people usually leave me alone. In the state I was in this conversation seemed like it would be way too intense for me and French just sort of came to me as my default response to the situation. My exact words were “je voudrais une boulangerie” (one of my favourite lines to use) and I shrugged my shoulders a bit with a weak smile. She pretty much just left me to it after that and I got on my way. I did my walk and got home about two hours later, I was tripping majorly so the walk ended up taking a lot longer than it needed to. When I got home though my next door neighbour was stood in her doorway talking to another neighbour who was stood outside. I tried to keep my head down because I couldn’t handle any more human interaction but she waved at me and said “bonjour”, so I instinctively returned the bonjour and got inside my house as fast as possible. When I got in I started freaking out straight away because I realised that I’d just become French and now two of the neighbours think I can’t speak any English. The next day when I woke up I realised the best thing I could do (as an Englishman) was just live with the lie for the rest of my short stay in this house to avoid the excruciating embarrassment of having pretended to be French for seemingly no reason. 

Fast forward 10 months, I still live here, and at this point I’m in DEEP. My life on this street is a web of lies. I’ve perfected my French accent and over the course of 10 months French Me has learnt a decent amount of English so he can hold disjointed conversation.
I’d gotten to know the neighbours pretty well and I was the nice quirky French guy on the street. I didn’t let the lie slip ever, because every day and every conversation I had just meant that it would be even worse if anyone ever discovered I wasn’t French. If I had friends come over (I don’t have many so it wasn’t too bad) they knew to never speak to the neighbours because of my strange situation. Most of them found it amusing, at least. 

Things were going okay and I wasn’t too worried about being exposed anymore because I’d gotten so used to it. I’m not home that much and when I am I rarely leave the house for any reason so I only had to do it for maybe 5 minutes a day when I was out on my street. If anything it was a nice way to spice up my day when I got to take on my French persona. French Me somehow had much better social skills than the real me, even if his English was a bit limited.

But then there was the day it all came crashing down. I was walking to my car and saw one of the neighbours coming towards me from the opposite direction with someone else next to her I didn’t recognise. She stopped to say hi, as she normally does, and then she says to her friend “this is f7tj78, the guy I was telling you about”. You might be able to see where this is going. 

Her friend hits me with a question in French that I didn’t understand a word of, and I knew he was actually French straight away because his accent was way better than mine. I didn’t know what to do and I just froze. Every second that went past just made it so much more painful and after way too long of a pause I just decided I had to come clean. I told her I wasn’t actually French and couldn’t speak French and then I tried to play it off like some kind of practical joke I’d been doing on everyone. Nobody was buying that. I fast walked straight to my car and then let the embarrassment just swallow me for a while.

I haven’t spoken to any of my neighbours since, some of which I’d  struck up a friendly relationship with over those 10 months. I make sure nobody is around now whenever I leave the house, and I do a loop around the block in my car if any of my neighbours are walking down the street when I get home so that I never come into contact with them. Every time I think about the day I was discovered the embarrassment physically hurts me.

TL;DR: Pretended to be French to avoid human interaction on LSD, lived a lie for 10 months and got exposed by a French man."
3,"TIFU by seeing my mother's porn.


My PC sits next to my Stepdad's laptop in the living room. My cat likes to jump on the keyboard or the laptop and lay on it. A moment ago, he jumped up onto the keys and the screen lit up showing me to opened photo gallery. I went over and was going to close the application and then shut down the laptop. I was greeted with three distinct photos.

&amp;#x200B;

One- My mother and my stepdad in a threesome. The thing is, the person in the middle was my mother's best friend. I saw her eating out my own mother as my Stepdad drilled the other girl.

&amp;#x200B;

Two- My mother sucking off my stepdad, In my dad's house. On the counter. Where I eat.

&amp;#x200B;

Three- More tame, but my stepdad (who is bald) with a decent head of hair. I've never seen him with more than a little fuzz before.

&amp;#x200B;

So I have to face them tomorrow with these images seared into my mind.

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR - Saw my mom's porn. Help me God."
4,"TIFU by hoarding my grandparents' pension and starving them.


My grandparents don't earn much and are living hand to mouth. They don't go out much from their house. So I help them in their routine chores like paying bills, going to ATMs etc.  I'm also incharge of collecting their pension. 

Few days back, my granddad gave me the undertaking required to collect the pension. It usually takes an hour but that day it took 3. I also had somethings to attend to. So, when I was done, I realised that it was late. I came back to my place (we live separately) and figured that I'll return his pension the next day. 

The next few days were so hectic that I completely forgot about his pension. I usually keep two wallets, one has all the cash (which I keep at home and has the pension) and the other one has only cards. I use the latter one more. After 5 days, I was in need of some cash. So I opened my other wallet and realized that his pension was still sitting there. 

I was horrified and then some guilt came and then a little more. I was so ashamed that i ran to their house. I knew that they'd be angry so I bought some groceries as a compensation. As soon as My granddad opened the door,  I started apologizing. He kept smiling during my apology and forgave me as soon as I was done. I handed over the pension and went to keep the groceries in the fridge.

Well my guilt was gone and I was again my normal miserable self. I opened the fridge to put the groceries in, and it was literally empty except a few ice trays there was nothing. My guilt came running back to me, I walked in the kitchen and there was just a half cut loaf of bread. I knew I was the cause of this. 

I asked them about it and they told me how they knew I was busy and thought that I'd turn up when I have the time. They didn't even try calling me because of the same reason. I had never been more ashamed in my life.  My one mistake pushed them towards starvation. 

They already had a really hard life. They had been abandoned by their children, who took all their money. First their children stopped caring then somewhere down the line, they did too. And I guess that's why they've stopped asking for anything from anyone. It's really hard to watch and still, they keep smiling with their saddened eyes. I guess when you get old, you stop expecting from life anymore. 

TL;DR: forgot to give my grandpa's pension back due to my busy schedule. They didn't have enough money to buy groceries and had to survive on a loaf of bread."
5,"tifu by having a threesome


My girlfriend and I have been together for several months now. We only see each other on weekends due to distance and work schedules, but this last weekend I fucked up. 

Her friend was hanging out with us, who is also female. They were making out and grabbing on each other, and well one thing led to the next and I was involved. We went to the bed and started fucking, but before I went inside her friend, I looked at my girlfriend in the eyes and asked, ""is this okay?"" 

She said yes, but shortly after this, my girlfriend got up and left but we thought she went to the bathroom. After a few minutes, we stopped having sex and went to look for her but couldn't find her for 15 min. 

My girlfriend was understanding and wasn't upset with me, or her friend, or so I thought. I called her the following night cause I felt extremely guilty. She said it was okay and it was just a spur of the moment kind of thing. She simply asked that I never do it again. 

Come this weekend, she breaks up with me over text saying she doesn't want to be with someone who slept with her friends. I absolutely love her so much but I let lust get between us. 

I really fucked up guys..

TL;DR: I fucked my girlfriend's friend with her and then she broke up with me because she doesn't want to be with someone who slept with her friends."
6,"TIFU by dating my cousin for 5 months


You hear this story millions of times of people unknowingly hooking up with their relatives and finding out about this atrocity in the most awkward ways, and mine was no exception.. even had to create a new account cause it is so embarrassing 

I was talking to this guy on Hinge who had the softest of hazel eyes, and at the time, I thought he was the one. After exchanging a few messages, we decide to go on a date, and one thing lead to another, and we were a couple. We dated for about 5 months, until the horror struck us that we were relatives...

Since we are both in our mid 20s, we were moved away from home and hadn’t had time to meet each other’s parents. Instead of doing the traditional, I’ll bring you over to meet my parents, and I’ll go over to meet yours, we decided for a dinner with both our parents. You can pretty much tell where this story goes now. 

Long story short, we took our families out to a restaurant, and when my father stood up from the table to introduce himself to my boyfriend’s mother, his face turned completely white, as he was looking directly at his cousin(Uncle’s daughter). It took her a second to realize as well. Since my family and his family live on opposite sides of the states, our parents hadn’t seen each other in about 30 years, and it was coincidence that my boyfriend and I moved to the same city. We could tell something was wrong the way our parent looked at each other, and they informed us that we were related. Even though we loved each other, we decided it wasn’t right to do. That was one of the hardest breakups of my life, but it had to be done for the sake of our family. I told my friends that it didn’t work out and silently removed everything from social media..

TLDR; dated a boy from hinge for about 5 months, and discovered he was my cousin after our parents informed us while out to dinner"
7,"Tifu by accidentally proposing to my GF of 2 months


So this just happened. Back story i had a GF of 6 years i was going to propose to, and as not necessarily superstitious i will not ""recycle"" an engagment ring even tho it cost what it did. I thought it was stolen or lost. It had been missing for close to 3 years. 

So what happened. In the proccess of rearranging my kitchen i decided to consolidate a few boxes of the same product (lipton tea) i had several boxes and was going to put them all into one. Simple enough i thought. 

Now with my new girl friend standing to my right i open the first box and holly mother of fucking pearl it cant be, but it is the ring box. This is where my thinking was holly shit i just found that ring, no way... hey babe check this out just found that ring i lost. Not really thinking a lot about it i open the box and turn to her. 

Seemed pretty simple i found a lost ring, hey look what i found.

And thats when she made a really awkward face started shaking and runs out of the room basicly saying no fucking way Oh My God no fucking way. At this point im like wtf was that about. When i walk around the corner to check whats wrong shes almost crying saying really too soon, not yet at least.

LIGHT BULB she thought i was proposing to her ( in what may be one of the strangest ways possible) but never the less she saw a ring being held out to her and freaked the fuck out. 

Hour latter trying to explain i wasent and it was a lost ring i had literally just found she and i are laughing our asses off.

Good to know it wasent a flat out no!


TL;DR found a lost ring had bad timing GF thought i was propossing heart fell to floor hilarity insued."
8,"TIFU by slapping my teachers ass


So basically I was in class with one of my friends who takes the same subject and he was super energetic and always wore semi-formal clothing.

This is in my relaxed electronics class where very one moves around and is always chatting away. So it's mufiday and my friend was leaning over a desk with his ass sticking out while he was bending over talking to another student. 

Do I go up and wind my arm up with a huge wind up and slap his ass so hard that he immediately jumps up, as if he's just jumped out of his own skin. 

You see, the problem with that was thay the person was not actually my friend... but our teacher. 

Everyone is at a stand still, waiting for my death penelty, especially my friend whose just staring my down at this point, and the teacher's face goes bright red, and I'm starting to freak out thinking I'm doomed. 

Except, the teacher just sits down, looks me in the eyes and says, ""Hewy (not my real name but username will do). Save that for after class"" with a big grin on his face.

Everyone at this point busts out laughing as I'm sitting here absolutely shitting my pants thinking I was about to get kicked out of school. 

God, I love my teach hahaha

TL;DR
I was having a good day in class, when I mistakingly slapped my teachers ass and get totally embarrassed by the comment he makes at the end of it."
9,"TIFU by missing my own graduation


I was supposed to graduate with my Masters degree and had invited my whole family to attend my graduation. The only problem was that I told them all that my graduation was on Sunday because I actually thought it was on Sunday. People booked tickets, and cousins were coming from all over America. 

This morning I wake up at 11:30 and was casually seeing my Instagram stories to see everyone in robes. My official school account also was posting about people graduating today. So I went back to the email they sent a few weeks ago on the graduation dates -- turns out I missed graduation. I'm still lying in bed calculating the magnitude of my stupidity. I don't even know what I'm going to tell everyone in my family who's going to come down to ""see me walk"". I MISSED MY OWN GRADUATION!! 

TL;DR: Thought I was graduating on Sunday but the graduation was today."
10,"TIFU by asking too much from my gf's mom


This actually happened today.

So my gf and her mother haven't spoken much in the last few years. She lives up in Ohio and we reside in Florida. Well this past year, they have made a meaningful effort to reconnect and be closer.

The last time she visited, she saw an old Wii remote lying around and expressed how much she loved the Wii Tennis game. I always enjoyed the bowling game myself.

Now to the fuck up.

I thought it would be a nice gesture to get a working Wii and Wii sports game for the next time she visits.

So I text her: 

Me: Hey, guess what you can do next time you visit?

Her: What's that?

Me: Bowl me! If you think you stand a chance. &gt;:)

Her: Excuse me?

Me: You heard me, lol.

So 20 minutes or so go by, and my gf calls me, laughing hysterically.

I never said ""Bowl me"" oh no dear Reddit, I wrote ""Blow me""

Luckily, her mom is pretty down to earth, and laughed it off, but neither are gonna let me live it down anytime soon.

TL;DR: Got Wii sports for gf's mom visits, told her she could blow me instead of Bowl me."
11,"TIFU by letting my nephew play with my Google Home Mini


I live alone and like to set up my place as 'smart' as possible. So I have smart lights, speakers, smart locks and some other stuff set up. I set up a few 'joke' routines on Google Assistant that I would show my friends for a laugh. 

&amp;#x200B;

My whole family came over on the weekend and I was showing my 5 year old nephew how to use Google Home to change the color of the lights. Which he thought was the greatest thing in the world.

&amp;#x200B;

So cue the whole family coming to my bedroom to see the little guy having the time of his life. He says 'Hey Google!' followed by what sounded like a bit of gibberish. But Google Assistant thought he said 'wank mode'. Which just so happens to be one of the 'joke' routines I set up.. It gets triggered by saying either 'wank mode' or 'jerky jerky time'. 

It basically goes like this.

&amp;#x200B;

Google Assistant says 'Engaging wank mode, my Lord'

Front door locks

Bedroom light turns to 100% brightness and turns red

Bedroom speaker plays  Led Zeppelin - Immigrant Song

&amp;#x200B;

The awkward silence during those moments is something I will never forget.

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR Whole family believe they saw my ideal jerky jerky conditions thanks to Google Assistant."
12,"TIFU by showing my friend nude pictures of his sister


This happened almost 4 years ago, but today it made me think about it.

Backstory, I met this amazing girl at a party that some friends of mine were throwing.  It was a themed party, prep boy and school girls, and she was as kind as she was sexy.  We exchange numbers and proceed to texting and talking on the phone and went out on a few dates.

Well, just like most relationships, I assume, she sent me a few sexy pictures of herself.  Well one day, my buddy asks me about the girl I am dating.  I tell him about her and he asks about her body.  I show him a picture she took of herself laying out by the pool, neck down.  He grabs my phone and starts swiping.  Before I can stop him he freaks out yelling “that is my fucking sister!!!” I then realize the picture he was looking at was one I took of her fully nude.  After that, he was not too happy about it, or me dating his sister.

But this story has a happy ending.  The reason I am posting this today, is because this is the one year anniversary of the day I married that wonderful woman, and that buddy was one of my groomsman.

And before anyone asks, no, she has no clue her brother saw a picture of her nude, I think she would be mortified if she did.

Tl;dr: Was dating a girl who turned out to be my buddy’s sister, showed him a nude photo of her and he freaked out."
13,"TIFU by taking my bird for a walk and accidentally looking like a pedophile


My husband and I adopted my parent's parrot this spring after my dad passed away and my mom moved into assisted living. We got a backpack carrier for him last month so we can visit and my mom can still see him (the parrot, not my dad).

Since we have the backpack, we decided to take him for nature walks instead of always keeping him in the house. For now we're putting the backpack in a baby stroller so it's less of a jarring bumpy ride until he gets used to standing on a moving perch. It's got screen mesh on three sides so he can see out, but it's a little hard to see into his pack from more than a foot or two away. It just looks like we're pushing a stroller with a large backpack in it.

So yesterday we went on our first walk in a local park. The bird's quiet, or calmly chirping, or occasionally saying ""Hello, youuuuuuu"" and we respond back in kind, a call and response thing he likes.

The park's mostly deserted - until the local high school track team runs by for their after-school practice run through the park. A bunch of teenage boys, shirtless. And one lags behind. As the lone boy, maybe 15 years old, runs past us, the bird calls out the loudest wolf whistle ever. And my husband and I burst out laughing, as the boy runs away from us faster.

TL;DR: Our hidden parrot sexually harassed a young shirtless boy and made my husband and I look like pedophile bullying assholes."
14,"TIFU by missing the birth of my daughter


Happened yesterday at 2am. 

So my wife was pregnant. I work from home in internet marketing so don’t get out too too much, but she heard of a cool local tech conference and thought I should check it out. (Important detail to remember)

The conference was 2.5hrs away in a neighbouring city. 

Anyway.  She was 37 weeks pregnant (babies are typically cooked at 40), and has been feeling great so didn’t see any issue with me being gone one night. Like, what are the chances?

So me and a friend packed up and left for the conference at 1pm Thursday for the evening networking. 

Fast forward to 11pm, we’re having a beer before heading to bed after the networking is over, and I get a call from my wife:

“I think my water broke.”

“Umm.. what?!?”

We’re still 3 weeks early so I say no you’re probably not, go back to bed. Did some quick searches and Dr Google said that because she wasn’t having contractions, and she was otherwise feeling fine otherwise, it might just be pee from baby pressing on her bladder. No need to alarm. 

10 minutes later I get a text, “contractions started and they hurt like hell. Going to hospital now.”

She’s home alone and has no way to get to the hospital so is thinking of calling an ambulance, so my friend says his wife will go pick her up and take her. I tell my wife what’s going on and she agrees (she’s almost incoherent at this point and can’t talk or stand during contractions).

Meanwhile, we grab our shit and hit the road. 2.5 hours, we should be able to make it in time for the birth. Labors usually take 6-12 hours. No big deal. 

She gets to the hospital and they tell her that she’s fully dilated and baby’s already crowning. 

At this point they get her straight into a room (too late for an epidural), my friends wife gets me on FaceTime, and I watch in the passenger seat of a car via FaceTime my daughter being born in record time. 

Total time from water breaking to delivered child: 2.25 hours. 

I missed it by an hour. We get there and come cruising in and I got to meet my exhausted wife and beautiful baby daughter. 

So good news, I have a beautiful, healthy baby girl, bad news is I wasn’t physically there. But she can’t get me in trouble because she sent me to the conference! 

Tl;dr: wife sent me to a conference, didn’t think we’d have a baby that early, ended up having a baby that early and I missed it."
15,"TIFU by bringing a sex toy to a family birthday party


Obligatory this was not today. It will be a year ago a couple days from now so everyone who was in attendance is reminding me of it. 

I was invited to a birthday party for an old friend. I asked them what sort of thing they wanted for their birthday and they said “ever since I discovered bucky balls I’ve been really into ‘adult toys.’ “

I didn’t know what bucky balls were. But I know what “adult toys” are so figured the name was self explanatory. I thought it was a little bizarre to ask other people to buy you that kind of thing, especially since the invite for the party encouraged everyone to bring their families, but whatever floats your boat, I don’t personally care. 

So I did some research and ended up getting them a Pivot (combination cock ring/vibrator.)

I get to the birthday party, put my wrapped gift on the gift table, and all is well. We all drank champagne and socialized for a bit. I’ve known a lot of the people there for decades so we were briefing each other on how our kids are doing, work, etc. 

Fast forward about 45 minutes we’re eating cake and it’s announced it’s time to open presents. 

We gather around and the first present opened is a drone. I figure maybe not everyone there was a close enough friend to ask to buy an “adult toy.” A few people had brought their spouses and kids along, too, so I assumed the presents known to contain adult toys would be set aside to open later in private. 

The next present was a raspberry pi gaming kit from their closest friend in attendance. If anyone would be trusted to get an adult toy, it would have been this guy. Hmm, red flag. I then see my present was still mixed in with all the presents being opened. 

Now I’m getting confused and getting nervous wondering if maybe they were joking and didn’t think I’d ever actually get them a sex toy. 

Third present is opened and it’s Giant Jenga. That’s when I made the connection. I frantically whip out my phone and google “Bucky balls.” They’re a fucking magnetic desk toy of little balls that you mold into shapes. My fear is confirmed. 

I’m trying to maneuver my way to the table to get my present back without making a scene but there were barely 15 people at the whole party so I was having trouble being discreet. 

Just as I’m almost within arm’s reach of the table, of course, mine is grabbed. Paper is torn off and they turn the box over in their hands. It’s not immediately obvious what it is to look at the box because it’s just a nondescript image of a plastic doodad with a hole in it and a logo “pivot by WeVibe.” 

I hear “WeVibe, is it a speaker? How cool.” Someone goes “How’s it work?” And they start to read off the box, projecting for the whole room to hear “Powerful vibrations. Intensify pleasure during sex with rumbly... oh” voice trails off. 

We’re making partial eye contact, totally red in the face and embarrassed at this point. People in the room who’ve known me as a schoolteacher for years are now glaring at me as the sick fuck who brought a sex toy to a family birthday party at 3:00 in the afternoon on a Sunday. 

I quietly explain the mix up and, thankfully, most of the room is laughing so hard they can barely breath. The people who came most of the people who had kids with them were less amused, with one woman having to usher out her 7 year old who was still going “What is it? What is it I didn’t see it yet.” 

Some of the group invited me to every party they threw from then on and others never invited me anywhere again.

*TLDR: A friend asked me for an “adult toy” on their birthday. I bought them a vibrating cock ring. They meant they wanted like a Nintendo or dart board or something. It was opened in front of a roomful of families who’ve known me for years. They all think I’m a pervert now.*"
16,"TIFU by finding my girlfriends diary


This happened about a week ago, and I’m still trying to process everything.  My girlfriend and I went through a breakup but got back together after a couple weeks.  Soon after getting back together, I was alone in her room and she was in the shower. I was laying on her bead when I noticed a old chemistry notebook, me being a blockhead decided to open it because I wondered why she still had it.  What greeted my eyes was an entry from when we were broken up about how she and her ex were hooking up and how much she was liking it.  I decided to go back a couple more pages and found out that her and her ex were hanging out before we broke up, behind my back, and that most of the reasoning for her breaking up is because she wanted to get back with this ex who was “just a friend”.  I also found out that part of the reason she wanted to get back together was because she found out her ex was talking to someone else and that her ex just wanted to be friends with benefits but nothing more.  I don’t know what do do now but part of me wishes I never opened that diary because I can’t stop thinking about it.

TL/DR: Read my girlfriends diary on accident, found out she broke up with me for her ex, and got back together with me because her ex didn’t want a relationship."
17,"TIFU by having my mom take me to the ER for blue balls


This happened about four years ago when I was 16, just after getting my first first gf. Thought I knew everything there was about sex and sexuality after all the hours I spent researching in preparation for what I thought I was coming to me. I was very, very wrong.

She came over one day after school while my mom was gone and we dry humped liked clothed bunnies for about an hour or so. She had work so she left shortly after and then I hopped on xbox ready to brag to my friends about all the ass I just grabbed. About 30 minutes later, my balls started to hurt. Excruciatingly so. I assumed it was just from getting my balls smooshed for so long and that it would pass quickly. It didn't. By the time my mom came home, it had gotten intolerable. I laid on the floor of my room with baggy boxers and my legs wide open. Any movement or touch was awful. 

&amp;#x200B;

Thing is, I had heard of blue balls but I always thought it was just a metaphorical thing to describe when you thought you were gonna get lucky, but didn't. When I looked up ""incredible pain in my balls"", all that came up was stuff about infections and circulation being cut off. Scary stuff. I guess no medical diagnosis for whatever blue balls is comes up when you look that up because its just assumed that you know you have blue balls, if you have blue balls.

I had been scared enough by the search results to justify going through the embarrassment of telling my mom my balls were in pain and I needed to see a doctor. I've always been a known mild sadist to my family in how much I love boxing, so when she asked how bad it was on a scale of 1-10, and I said 9, she took it seriously. We rushed over to the hospital and got me checked in asap. I asked my mom if she could stay in the waiting room and she was cool with it. After being led into a room by the nurse, the doctor began asking me all sorts of questions about my pain and symptoms. When he asked if I had had any sexual activity recently, I reluctantly admitted I was dry humping with my gf earlier that day. 

He paused, and asked if I ever ejaculated at any point.

I said no.

At least sixty years old with a completely white comb over and huge glasses, my doctor gets stoic and asks, ""Well son, do you think it's possible that you just have blue balls?""

I froze.

""what.""

He raised an eyebrow, smirked a little and said ""If you don't ejaculate after sexual activity, it's possible to get what is commonly known as blue balls, where the testicles are inflamed after all the blood that's gone to them without ever releasing."" Or something like that.

Maybe I would have started to laugh if my balls didn't hurt so damn much. Instead I responded, ""that's a thing!?""

He laughed a little and said yes, he's afraid it is.

I asked what I could do.

He said take an ibuprofen or masturbate.

So I did both. 

A pee after 10 hours of driving has nothing on the relief I felt then.

I tried lying to my mom and said it was just an inflammation from laying on them wrong, but she saw through it and said that if she was paying the co-pay for the appointment she wanted the truth. So, I told her how I got something called blue balls from messing around with gf while she was gone. She laughed that I didn't know what blue balls were, and wasn't aware I was sexually active yet. 

On the drive home, she asked if I needed any condoms. 

Cringing, I bitterly said no thank you.

She told me that if I'm going to be sexually active then I need to be safe.

I muttered that we weren't having actual sex.

""Well then how did this happen?""

""God can you please just leave it we were just grinding and stuff that's how""

Short pause

""Well then make sure you masturbate or something after sweety so that this doesn't happen again.""

My mom has always had little inhibition censoring stuff with me, but that has forever taken the cake. My fault for being a dumbass though I guess.

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR

Teenage me messed around with girl for first time. Didn't know blue balls actually hurt. Had my mom drive me to the ER. Had to tell her I had been messing with gf and didn't know what blue balls were. My mom recommended I masturbate."
18,"TIFU by helping my wife breast-feed our newborn


I was tidying up our back porch and noticed I hadn’t yet put anything in one of our planters. I remembered some assorted dried pepper seeds I had in the kitchen cupboard. The thing is, I couldn’t remember what pepper was what now that they were all dried up. So I grabbed a yellow one and a red one. I tore them open, planted them, and went inside: no problem. 

Now our newborn is feeding every hour, so my wife has to use a nipple shield (it’s a piece of silicone with holes in it that extends the nipple and protects the nipple from getting too raw). I heard the baby’s timely cry, so like clockwork, I grabbed the nipple shield, washed it, and placed it on my wife’s nipple for her so she could feed the baby without having to get up. I am the WORST DAD EVER: little did I know, but some of the pepper oil that got on my hands (I didn’t know dried peppers could still have oil in them) got on the nipple shield. Our baby started to WAIL and nothing could make him stop. We couldn’t figure out what was wrong until my mouth began to burn. I guess I had also gotten my fingers near my mouth. So I full on stuck my fingers in my mouth to determine what kind of pepper. Judging by the heat in my own mouth and knowledge of the peppers I had dried, I had planted a Carolina Reaper. My tender little boy cried bloody murder for at least two and a half hours straight and we did everything we could think of/find on the Internet to stop the burning. 
Luckily, from what we can tell, not very much got on the nipple shield and the pepper wasn’t to it’s full potency or things could have been much much worse. Now I feel like I should never touch my child again- this whole fatherhood thing is not off to a great start. 

TL;DR
Touched some dried Carolina Reaper seeds. Then touched my wife’s nipple shield that goes in baby’s mouth. Baby cried horribly for two and half hours straight. I’m the worst dad ever."
19,"TIFU by accidentally having sex with my cousin at a family wedding


So I originally posted this to r/confession a couple nights ago, and thought here might also appreciate the story. Obligatory: this fuck up did not happen today, but nearer to two years ago. 

As a disclaimer: this is my first Reddit post and on mobile so apologise for formatting yada-yada-yada. 

So this happened about 18 months ago, or somewhere in the vicinity of 18-20 months. I still get flak from this from both family and friends. 

So, the setting: my uncle’s wedding. It’s around Autumn and my uncle by my mothers side, from an exceptionally large family (this is relevant), is getting married for the second time. Now my family is very large. My mother has 3 brothers and 5 sisters. All with children of their own, and some even with children of their own now. 

The wedding isn’t what I would describe as large, pretty much encompassing just family and close friends. All in all, there can’t have been more than 50 or 60 people there, and around 60% (at a rough estimate) or so are related by blood to me. They make up the majority is what I’m trying to say, and many are spread over whom I have only briefly met, or in some cases, never met. Well, you can see where this is going. 

For reference, I would be around mid 17 in this story, with the age of consent in my country (UK) being 16. The girl, who we shall call Isla, was 22 or 23. 

Well, at the reception, I am having a good time with my sister, parents and cousins. Dancing, heavily indulging in drinking etc. Just generally enjoying myself as it is rare for large family gatherings for us for obvious reasons. 

A girl I don’t recognise begins to dance with me on the (very crowded) dance-floor. She’s older than me clearly, but I thought maybe 19 or 20. Anyway, we start dancing, touching etc. She twerks on me a little, I grind a bit and I presume nobody noticed due to accumulated intoxication and crowdedness around where we were. One things leads to another, we start kissing and she asks me if I want to go ‘upstairs’, which I correctly take to mean her room in the hotel (it was a hotel wedding). 

I, of course, being a hormonal teenage boy (still am), jump at the opportunity and say yes. I should say this wasn’t my first time or anything and by this point I carried condoms around in my wallet when I went out and knew I would be drinking. 

So we proceed to discreetly (or so I think) take our leave. Both drunk, obviously, but not to the point of not being in control of our actions, or stumbling around/blackout etc. I get to her room, a bit of excited talk, and clothes come off. All is going well. Now, I should say that all this time I’m assuming this girl is a relative (or perhaps friend?) of the bride. Oh boy. I was in for a shock. Because, as it turns out, she thought the same of me. 

As we were ‘cleaning up’, so to speak, we begin a little small-talk when before had mostly just been purely sexual. She eventually asks how I know the bride (let us call her Emma). I stop. Thunderstruck. The realisation slowly creeping up on me and oh, the horror. I laugh it off (hoping, in vain) she is joking and state I am the son of (insert mothers name). The shock is palpable on who I then realised as my cousins face as she was putting her bra back on. She sort of freaks out and says she’s the estranged daughter of one of my uncles who’s had a troubled life, whom she had very recently reconnected with (I did not know this). We essentially collectively let out a ‘fuckkkkk’. 

From there we got dressed quickly and decided to never reveal this major cock-up to a soul and hope to God we had not been noticed (alas). We decided it would be best if she were to leave first, and that I would follow around 5-10 minutes later. 

Well I do. She leaves first, and I just kind of stand around in the hallway on my phone freaking out for a short while until I decide enough time has passed to erode suspicion. 

Well, first thing I see when I get down is the look of pure disappointment on my mothers face, the stupid fucking grin on my fathers and half my cousins faces and my sister looking in disgust, as though she was watching a particularly repulsive sea-slug. One of my cousins whom I am close to pats me on the back, shaking his head and laughing his absolute head off. I know I am defeated then and quietly take a seat expecting the utter bollocking I will later receive from my family. My elderly 90 year old grandmother was there for fucks sake. And word was not quiet. I didn’t see Isla or her father again that reception and later found out she told him and he took her home, not to the hotel she had booked, by way of taxi.

So yeah. I accidentally took part in (protected, thank-God) incest. It is brought up at every, and I mean every, family-gathering. A couple of my cousins have taken to playing ‘Sweet Home Alabama’ and asking when the next date is whenever I enter the room. 

After (soberly) explaining to my parents it was an accident and I fully believed she was not a relative (like they should have questioned it) they were okay-ish with it, but still disappointed and annoyed a little. My father asked me how I’d failed to notice Isla (apparently) sat literally the row behind us, and I had no answer. Gotta work on my observation skills I guess. Not only do my family still tease me, but my friends found out from my sister within days and I’ve been relentlessly teased by them at most social gatherings since. You can imagine how many cousin/incest/alabama jokes daily. 

I am ashamed to this day. Even more so because she is an objectively attractive woman. As one might imagine, the limited interactions we’ve had since have been extremely strained and awkward, not helped by my dickhead cousins. There is another big family wedding coming up this summer, and since the announcement ‘the incident’ as it’s come to be known as has been all that’s been discussed within my hearing.

Anyway, I hope you all enjoyed that rollercoaster. If you have any questions feel free, and once again, do forgive the surely egregious formatting as I am just popping my Reddit virginity with this story, which I’ve been encouraged to (anonymously) post online by friends so as to make you all laugh as much as them.

TL;DR I had sex with my uncles estranged daughter at a family wedding my first time meeting her. Everybody in the (large family) knew then, and now, and will never let me live this down."
20,"TIFU by letting my mom see a picture of my girlfriend


Let me start this off by saying my girlfriend and I have been dating for almost a month now and she has told me many times about how she has been bullied at school for her looks and how much she weighs, I don't really understand where it comes from because I think she looks great, well today I was talking to her on snapchat and my mom looks at my phone and asks who im talking to I reply it's my girlfriend, she proceeds to say ""Wow she really isn't cute"" my mom didn't know that she was able to be heard saying that and my girlfriend went dead silent and ended the call, I've tried to message her many times and she won't respond and ive explained that I love you way she looks and I love her personality and she won't respond anymore, it's been about 45 minutes since this happened and I feel horrible for it, I'm going to just let her be alone for a while and hope she will atleast talk to me.

TLDR; My mom looked over my sholder while talking to my girlfriend and said she was ugly now my girlfriend won't respond to any of my texts and I feel horrible."
