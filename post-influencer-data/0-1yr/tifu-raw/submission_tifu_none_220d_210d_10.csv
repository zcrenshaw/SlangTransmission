0,"TIFU by trusting Alexa and my morning hearing.


This morning, I woke up naturally after going to bed pretty early. 830pm or so. i work at 8am  
I ask Alexa, half asleep: ""Alexa, what time is it""  
Alexa: ""It is 6am""  
I think, ""Perfect! I can get a good early start today and maybe get a little overtime at work""  
I immediately get up and hop in the shower. Feeling good. Get out and get dressed. Then make some espresso, even better, great morning. I walk the dogs and walk back inside to feed them.

I then notice the stove and microwave say 1:30am.   
I think to myself: ""ah, power must of went out.""  
I then check my phone...it's fucking 1:30am. Freshly showered and espresso'd up.  
Alexa either lied to me, or I heard ""6"" instead of ""1"" somehow.  
Basically impossible to go to sleep at this point after showering AND espresso.So i spend the middle of the night doing laundry and playing Apex Legends for 4 hours waiting for it. I then try to seel around 5:30 or so, only to lay there awake and end up only actually sleeping maybe 30 minutes before getting back up and dressing again. and walking dogs again.  Great morning.   


TL;DR: Alexa lied or I misheard, woke up at 1am instead of 6am, showered and espresso, couldn't sleep, rough morning."
1,"TIFU By Using Google Calendar to Contact My Ex


So, Reddit, about two months ago, I went through a horrible break up. He was a complete dick about the whole thing, and before winter break (I'm a college student), I vowed to never interact with him again.  

Fast forward to last week, as I'm hanging out with some friends, and blissfully out of his life. The four of us, who had all gone through recent breakups, decided to go out to dinner the Saturday after Valentines Day to a Hot Pot restaurant that we really liked and then get drunk off our asses afterwords. 

Well, last night in an attempt to organize my life, I decided to put all my social events for the week in google calendar and added them all to a calendar called ""Events, ect"" which I thought was a built in google doc calendar. I named the Hot Pot dinner ""Hot V-day Date"", cause you know, ""Hot Pot"". 

This morning I get a text from a mutual friend of my exes letting me know that ""Events, ect"" was actually a calendar he created for me, my ex and another friend when we were all together over the summer, and that everyone on the calendar had been notified about my ""Hot Date"". Including my ex. Who I haven't talked to in two months and who I dumped.

I think I'm going to try and shove my head through  a heating grate, Reddit.

TL;DR: I accidentally invited my ex to a ""Hot Date"" on V-Day Date via Google Calendar. "

3,"TIFU by sleeping in way too late


This morning I had my alarm set for 5:45 so that I could have an hour to finish calc homework before having breakfast and making it to school on time. However, as the title says... that didn't happen. I normally leave my house at 7:50. I woke up at 7:50.

&amp;#x200B;

As soon as I saw the time, I went into full panic mode. I was planning to just get going, maybe grab a portable snack to serve as breakfast, but when I careened out through the kitchen to get to the front door, my parents were waiting there with a full breakfast.

&amp;#x200B;

I tried protesting about how little time I had, but they told me that I needed to eat everything that was there because breakfast is important, yada yada yada, typical parental warnings. I knew I wasn't getting out of it so I frantically started shoving cereal down my throat while wildly gesticulating about the time and how terrible all this was going to be.

&amp;#x200B;

I ultimately ended up eating in about ten minutes. For context, I tend to eat really slowly and it would have taken me about forty minutes to eat that same quantity. Motivation truly can be an amazing thing.

&amp;#x200B;

I finally left my house at 8:05. School started at 8:15, I walk a mile to get there, and my walk typically takes fifteen to twenty minutes. Time to sprint.

&amp;#x200B;

I sprinted a bit, jogged some, speed-walked most of it because I haven't taken P.E. in two years and I'm so out of shape. The 8:15 bell rang just as I was walking through my school's quad - I jogged the last few dozen steps and just *barely* made it to class at about 8:15 and a few seconds.

&amp;#x200B;

It all ended well, I kept my perfect record of never having been late to class, I learned that I can eat *really* fast if I'm in a panicked frenzy... but yeah, this morning was all sorts of disastrous and could have been much worse.

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR: I overslept and had half an hour to do what normally takes an hour and a half."
4,"TIFU by not noticing a level left on my car and being locked out of my running car in the middle of the street.


Today I left to get a cigar. It's been three days since I stopped smoking. I've been having problems with chronic bronchitis and when only one of my lungs worked Friday for two hours, I figured this was my time to quit. The universe provided me with additional motivation when I got the flu the next day.

When I left the house I didn't notice the level I was looking for was left on the hood of my car by my dad. I got about a mile from the house when I noticed it and it shortly afterwards fell from the hood of my car.

There wasn't any traffic so I made a u turn and got out of the car to grab it. That when it hit me. My car auto locks all doors when I go 5+ mph. However, when you open the door it unlocks that door. 

The same door I put off repairing the door handle for a month.

I just locked myself out of my car in the middle of the street with it running.

I have no spare key, but I remember I have a old key fob at the house that still works. So I walk a mile to my house to grab it and walk back to my car.

Unknown to me, key fobs don't work when the engine is running.

TL;DR

TIFU by ignoring the signs not to smoke

5,"TIFU by coughing up water on my desk and a person in class


This happened a couple of hours ago, so i still feel very bad about it. Typing on mobile so sorry for any errors.

So to explain this i have to say, yes i am sick. I've been sick for the past 3 or 4 days with a bad cold which has started to die down, but not as fast as i want it to.
And now we're at the fuck up, during my english class while my teacher was reading some excerpt i didn't care about, i started to cough a lot to the point that it was noticeable. So i decided to just down a bit of water from my metal tin, and just go on with class. So i did that, but what happened in the middle was a cough i felt coming up, so i thought ""no problem, ill just finish this gulp and cough a little, keep drinking afterwards"". 
My body on the other hand said nope, fuck that shit and instead coughed up the entire mouthful of water all over my desk and the back of the girl in front of me.
Thankfully the girl and everyone else including my teacher was very cool about it, once i explained the situation, and all she said in regards to her shirt was ""its fine no one can see it since ill have my jacket on over it"", which she initially took off because the classroom was hot as balls. And everyone went back to their business, but i just couldnt get it out of my mind, so i posted it here.

TL;DR: Have been sick for the past few days, while drinking water to suppress a cough, another cough came up and spit the water everywhere including a girl in front of me who was surprisingly cool about it."
6,"TIFU by scrolling through my Twitter feed at work


This just happened an hour ago. I had my phone near my face reading up on Twitter feeds. My face was all serious, and it looked like I was just trying to hide something cause I was slouched on my chair. Just when I was scrolling down on my feed, my boss walks behind me to get to the printer on my right side. I turned my head just for a second to see what he was doing, and when I turned my head back I caught a glimpse of the next tweet feed slightly on the bottom of my phone. I knew what that picture was since it's NSFW. 

It was a picture of a cosplayer in a Bayonetta tight black bikini outfit with DDs retweeted by the guy who made Bayonetta. I went into panic mode, instead of scrolling upwards I scrolled downwards. Obviously it was a really stupid move cause my instincts are to scroll down not up. I could have turned off the phone but my mind wasn't thinking straight. Just as I tried to scroll, my boss was already looking at my direction while he walked by my chair.  My fingers seemed like it wasn't fast enough to scroll and for some reason the picture was dead smack on my screen. There was that awkward silence while he just walked behind me. I made it worse by making it seem that I wasn't watching porn by trying to start a discussion of people posting weird stuff on Twitter. ""Ahah.. wow people post weird stuff on Twitter"". The laugh wasn't even a laugh but a nervous laugh, and he just quietly sat down on his chair and started typing. I just sat there trying to think of ways to make him think otherwise but the damage is done. Now I know this will go around the office building by tomorrow. Wait until it hits the finance dudes who will joke about this all day long. Thanks to Hideki Kamiya for that NSFW!!

Tldr: Scrolling through Twitter at work, saw a skimpy bikini DDs Bayonetta cosplayer while my boss caught me, and he most likely thinks I was watching porn on my phone."

8,"TIFU by taking some LSD right before my parents came over, getting my dad stoned and accidentally snitching on my brother *hurry and read while mods are asleep


*this got removed a few months ago pretty quickly but this story is very entertaining and I was thinking about this tonight so here it is. 

Obligatory this happened almost a year ago. Since then my dad has lost his battle with cancer (he passed away in January). This happened a few months before his passing and was one of the last times he was at my house. 

But this isn’t a sob story by any means. On the contrary; it’s one of the few recent memories I have of him that makes me laugh to myself when I think about it. Things have somewhat gotten better for me and after I read a TIFU about a guy trying to heard kittens on Mushrooms I’ve been wanting to share my “psychedelic TIFU”. This is a somewhat long read but I think it’s worth it. TL;DR at the bottom. 

About 2 years ago I started to take a bi- monthly LSD trip to kind of “reset”. Before that point I had only done acid once in high school and apparently it wasn’t that big of a dose; reason being, the one my buddy gave me 2 years ago sent me to the moon. 

It was definitely nothing I’d ever experienced before and believe it or not, that one experience helped me work towards fixing my marriage. Any who, that’s a whole different story. I’m not one of those people who says everyone should try it. As a matter of fact it isn’t for everyone but for me, it is therapeutic and helps with my anxiety. 

I would do it on Wednesday nights because Thursday was my off day and the kids are usually in bed by 8:00 since it’s a school night. That way I could take it around 7:30 and they’d be in bed before it would kick in. This Wednesday night was no different and I was rather looking forward to it. 

I get home around 7:00. Immediately I go upstairs to shower (sort of a ritual of mine) and took it at 7:30. Well, lo and behold my wife surprises me with great news - “Hey, your parents, your little sister, your brother and his wife are coming over to drink coffee and hang out. They’re on the way”

....


I stand there shocked. I tried telling her to tell them I wasn’t feeling good but it was too late. They were already in the neighborhood. Even though I usually tell her in advance when I’m taking my “trip”, I hadn’t told her yet on that particular day nor did I bring it up at that moment. 

They show up about 8:00. At that point I was feeling a little giddy but functional nonetheless. Keep in mind that my dad was going through heavy chemo sessions so he was in constant pain. I tell him to sit in the backyard with me while everyone was inside. 

Growing up, my dad was very anti marijuana and I gave him hell as a teenager because of it. For example, at 17 he found a pound of weed in my trunk. We won’t get into that; that’s a whole different TIFU. 

 After he was diagnosed with cancer, I convinced him to smoke a joint with me to alleviate the pain. It was the weirdest thing ever. I had only smoked with him one time before the day in question and he only took two light puffs but it helped him eat and sleep that day. 

So we’re sitting outside while everyone else is inside tuned into my mom’s favorite show on Netflix. I could see it in his face how much he was hurting and I couldn’t bear it. It’s about 8:45 and I was in the “is it kicking in..I don’t think it’s kicking in...is it kicking in?” phase. There was like a white hue around everything I was looking at and I was feeling very warm. 

I pull out the joint I had already rolled up (as I always have it already rolled; do you know how hard it is to roll a joint on acid?) and tell him “look, obviously the pain meds are helping a lot. Hit this a couple of times before Mom or someone comes out!” 

He declined at first but I finally convince him. I warned him that this stuff was much stronger than the last time he smoked so take a small drag and that’s it. I light it and hand it straight to him. 

Against my advice, my dad takes 3 hard ass, Bob Marley-esque drags; one after the next after the next until he coughed so hard I thought he was about to cough out a lung. I sat there thinking to myself “ohmygodohmygodohmygod” and even forgot that I had taken any acid. 

I grab the joint from him and kept asking him if he was ok. He said he was fine even though I could tell his head was spinning. I look around to make sure nobody was coming outside and figured “eh, it’s already lit. Might as well take a few puffs before I put it out.”

Biiiiiig mistake!! I take a good 3 or 4 drags and after I was done coughing, it hit me and I ain’t talking about an epiphany. The acid was kicking in HAAAARRRDDD. The white hue around everything started thicken and the night sky looked like it was painted onto a ceiling. I felt like I was levitating in my chair and I’m looking at my dad and he looks like he’s about to pass out. 

The patio table seemed like a mile long and even though my dad was sitting right next to me on the other side of the table, it felt like he was about a mile away as well. 

Even as I was sailing towards the moon I still had the wherewithal to tell him ,”look, mom or somebody might come outside and your eyes are very low and very red. Keep your face in your phone so they won’t notice.” He mutters something incoherent and starts reaching for his phone on the table but it looked like he was glued to the chair. 

I reach for his phone and at that point I’m reaching cloud 9. His phone felt so small in my hand and I sat down still holding his phone, forgetting to give it to him. I’m staring at the night sky and I finally remember I’m supposed to give him his phone. I hand it to him and he just had this confused look on his face. He was higher than a test rat. I was higher than giraffe pussy on a hot air balloon. 

Finally the back door opens. It’s my mom!! She sits at the table across from my dad. At that point he was on his Facebook but you can tell there was something “off” about him. I’m trying my best to have small talk with my mom but I couldn’t stop noticing how the sky looked like a painting and how intricate the bricks on my house were and questioning our existence in my mind. 

She keeps looking at my dad and asks him if he’s ok. He would mumble “yeah I’m fine” but he would stare at me with this smirk on his face. She asked if he had taken some sleeping pills or something and I answered “Yes! Yeah he took some sleeping pills!”

I’m thinking great! We’re Scott free but oh noooooo! My dad goes from grinning at me to full blown laughing and staring at me. I’m giving him the raised eyebrow “hint” for him to stop but to no avail. My mom then stares at him, then stares at me, then back at him, then back at me and yells,” did you smoke weed with your dad???!!”

I tried to act appalled at the idea that I would get my dad high but all I did was fumble out some words that I don’t remember. At this moment I feel like I’m melting into my chair. I mean I was fucking zooted!! 

After a little interrogation my dad admits that he smoked. For those of you who don’t understand Arabic; or better yet, Arabic curse words, there’s a certain eloquence to it. Especially when you’re on acid and your mom is the one cursing you! While she’s going off on me I look at my dad and he’s still laughing and staring at me. 

As good as I could at that moment, I’m trying to reason with my mom that I was only trying to help. She wasn’t having any of it. She even started asking my dad if she needs to take him to the hospital lol. He said he was fine and that he just wanted to sit for a while. 

Now my mom turns her attention to me and asks if my little brother smokes weed. To give a little insight, he’s the youngest of 5 boys and has always been the “golden child” of the family. He’s never been in trouble or did drugs but had recently started smoking weed on occasion. I’d told him to not do it but if he HAD to smoke, I’d smoke him out so he doesn’t get any bullshit. He was also a newlywed and his wife is very straight edge. No drugs; no alcohol. 

Anyway, I keep on saying no he doesn’t. She keeps grilling me and I go from “no he doesn’t” to “I don’t know...maybe??” I was caving in quickly and I’m thinking to myself “FUCK THIS CANT BE HAPPENING!”

Finally, whether it was true or reverse psychology she says ”his wife told me she smelled weed in his car. Tell me the truth now!” 

My dumb ass tells her “ ok, he’s smoked weed with me a couple of times but..”; and before I could finish the sentence, her eyes got wider than the expanse of the universe in which I was currently floating in in the 5th dimension and started cussing at me even worse and says she’s going to kill him. 

Well, with the incredible timing of a sitcom, guess who comes outside with complete obliviousness to what’s going on? You guessed right! My little brother comes waltzing over to the table and sits right next to my mom. Very bad place to sit right about now! 

SLLLAAAAPPPP! She smacks the back of his neck so hard I think her finger prints are still on his vertebrae. With a confused WTF look on his face he asks “what???” 

“You smoke weed you idiot??”

He looks at me with an even more confused look and all I could do is shrug my shoulders. At this point I’m tripping balls and the English language no longer existed. Hell, any form of communication at that point was out the window. He starts denying it of course and she tells him that I told her. Again he looks at me and again, I just shrug my shoulders. 

Keep in mind my dad had stopped laughing at that point and looked like he was going to doze off. At that moment I’m thinking this can’t get any worse. Welp, it did. My wife, his wife, my little sister AND MY KIDS come outside with tea and cookies. We go completely silent. 

So here we all are. Sitting on my back patio in deafening silence. I’m looking at my dad as he dozed in and out of consciousness. My mom giving me a death stare. My brother giving me a WTF stare. My wife looking at me because of the awkwardness. His wife looking at him like “what’s wrong”? My kids jumping around proudly because it was well past their bedtime. My sister looking at my dad because he’s acting weird. And all the while, I’m tripping absolute balls. 

Finally my mom tells my dad it was time to leave. I get up as “soberly” as I could and go to him to see if he needed help getting up. Thank god I did that because even though he said he was ok, as soon as he got up he almost fell backwards but I caught him. 

I walked him to the car and told my mom to let him lay down when he gets home. She wished death upon me and got into the car and they left...

It is pretty dim in my backyard so it was hard to see my pupils but once inside the house, my wife took one look at me and said “you took acid???” She then proceeded to tell me how stupid it was of me to do it before my parents came over. I didn’t even try to explain. I went and sat in my backyard and smoked the rest of the joint thinking of what the hell just happened. 

Good times. 

TL; DR - I took acid before my parents came over, got my dad super stoned and ratted my goody two shoe brother out for smoking weed to my mom.

Didn’t think much of it so I went on my way until I got home and told my husband about it. He busted out laughing and had to explain to me why my OB didn’t feel any hair - baby is still in large sac inside of me that hasn’t broke yet.  Duh. 🤦🏻‍♀️"
