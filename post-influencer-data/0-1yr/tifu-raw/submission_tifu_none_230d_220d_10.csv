0,"Tifu by not following instructions and mandolining my finger.


I bought a mandoline a month ago to slice potatoes.  I have used it once before with great success.  This morning I was using it to slice potatoes for breakfast and forgot to do one little thing.  Use the guard/holder.  I proceeded to slice the tip of my index finger off.  It was left on the blade of the mandoline.  I am fairly prone to passing out at the sight of blood.  I saw the decent sized chunk out of my finger, said chunk on the blade and the blood dripping down.  I started yelling for my husband and started sliding down the cabinets to the floor.  I never actually passed out this time because he took care of me.  I kept my head down by my knees while he cleaned up my finger, bandaged it up and cleaned up the blood.  The blood was everywhere.  In the sink, on the counter, on the floor and dripping down my arm.  

I still felt really bad so I asked him to finish slicing the potatoes and watch the sausage that was cooking.  I reminded him to be sure and use the guard when slicing.  I was going to lay down and try to get my equilibrium back.  After about 5-10 minutes, I felt better and went back to the kitchen.  I walked in and he had an enormous wad of paper towels on his thumb.   He looked at me and said he did the same thing.  I busted out laughing and he said the stupid guard didn’t work right.  The guard is difficult to use and actually stick into the potato.  He planned on just being careful and stop slicing close to the end.  That didn’t work.  

We both bled for a few hours and had to keep changing the bandaids because they were soaking through.  Every time I removed the bandaid, it would start the bleeding and throbbing all over again.  

Fast forward an hour or so.  My mom came over and I asked her if she had used her new mandoline, as she got one like mine after she saw how well mine worked the first time.  She said that she indeed had used it and managed to “hack the crap out of my finger”.  I had noticed she has had a bandaid on for the past week or so.  She did this two Thursdays ago and just now was able to take the bandaid off this morning.  

All I have been able to think is “I ain’t the sharpest tool in the shed.”  Apparently none of us are.  The mandoline is.  

Also came up with, “he was looking kinda dumb with a bandaid on his thumb”.  

TLDR:  Didn’t use the mandoline guard and sliced fingers instead of potatoes.  All of us.  

I don’t think mandolining is a word but I am going with it anyway. "
1,"TIFU by trying to save a dying squirrel, but instead I am now a squirrel murderer.


I took my dogs outside, and we stumbled on what I thought was a dead squirrel. But, then it moved. I grabbed a towel and picked it up. It was barely breathing. Eyes closed. Not looking good.

I brought it inside thinking maybe giving it some warmth would help. It was clear he had some sort of pneumonia, as it's nose was seeping fluid and it barely could breathe.

I tried calling every animal clinic, shelter, SPCA, etc., but they were not open or did not treat wild animals. 

I decided I'd let it die in warmth and peace, then toss it in the river behind my apartment.

Within 30 minutes, it stopped breathing. I said my goodbyes, and I tossed him in the river.

Except when he hit the water, he started twitching and trying to swim. Then, he stopped moving and sunk.

So, my effort to help a dying squirrel was in fact the actions that killed it. I feel awful.

TL;DR: I found a dying squirrel. Thought it was dead after it stopped breathing. Tossed it in a river. It was not dead, but it is now.

2,"TIFU being on my period and getting drunk


So like the title said I fucked up (it was after midnight so technicly today) by having my period and getting drunk.
If your one of those guys who nearly faints when someone mentions the word period, this post aint for you, It will fuck up your life.

My son’s birthday was yesterday, so I’ve been running around all day catering everybody and making sure the kids don’t break anything/eachother. Somewhere around noon I noticed my period got heavy and I put in a tampon, and went back to my guests.

Around 7 o’clock everyone left except my husband’s best friend, I put the kids to bed and started to relax. I’ve had a wine or 2 during the day, and now with my kids in bed I treated myself to a glass of wine, and during the evening my husband and I got pretty wasted (which for my was kinda easy cos I hadnt had a drink in like 2 weeks). 
Around 11 my husband went to bed because he got tired and pretty bored with me and his friend because we where talking about games, watching trailers, that kind of stuff. And since I’ve got no gamer friends I had a good time, getting drunker by the minute. Around 00.30 husbands friend decides to go home. 

This is where my FU begins.

I was pretty drunk, and drunk me tought sexytime with husband was a good idea (cos let’s face it, drunk sexytime is the best sexytime). But then I realised I still had my tampon in, so I had to get it out (also because it’s dangerous to have it in for as long as I unknowingly had, but most because of my desired sexytime). 

I went to the toilet, ready to pull it out, when I realised I couldnt “find” it, or the string. After some fumbling around I could feel al little bit of the string, alllllll the way tucked in. I spend about 15 minutes grabbing the string, trying to pull it out, only to feel like it was stuck, and I couldnt get a good grip at it. 
I was getting annoyed at this point, fingering myself on the toilet in search of The Lost Tampon wasn’t the kind of sexytime I had in mind. 

I decided to call the HAP (I live in Holland, here we dont go to the ER for everything, we go to out “homedoctor” for small things like a cold, bump on the head, vaccinations, deep cut and so on. But outside working hours there is the HAP which is like the on duty doctor/ nurse for like 50 doctors in the area). 

Trying to sound kinda sober I explained the nurse my problem, she was kind but firm, If I didnt get the fucker out in an hour, I had to come by and they would extract it. If I would wait till morning I would have it in for 20 hours and that is dangerous.  That would mean I would have to wake-up my husband not for sexytime but for I fucked up time, and we would have to get the kids out of bed.
I wasnt gonna let that happen (primerely because Im the hilarious one in our relationship, and I wasn’t ready to hear “yo pussy so big, tampons get lost” jokes for the rest of my life). 

So before this moment I was a woman on a mission, now I was Frodo trying to get this tampon out of Sauromons grip. 

Nurse mentioned trying to squad or take a relaxing shower. 

So here I was squatting in the shower with my hand in the depths of Erebor. Still not getting good enough grip. So I take the showerhead put the waterstream on 10 and try to flush this white torpedo out. Guess what, didnt work... this goes on like 15 minutes, time is getting scarce. 

Decide to lean agains the wall squatting, and I finally have the string between the tips of my thumb and indexfinger. I AM NOT LETTING GO NOW! While I pull gentely I push like I’m in labour, and what do you think, I finally pulled the fucker out! 

I felt extatic, leaned against the wall again in relieve, feeling proud about my victory.. sexytime here I come! 

Before I leave to shower I decide to take a closer look at the fucker, wondering why It took longer for me to give birth to this annoying bugger than with my youngest son.

I look at it, lying in the corner.. and my mind goes blank for a minute... then I scream.. I would’t have flipped out more if it was the wormy thing from Alien..
...Then the realisation kicked in.. 

I.PULLED.OUT.MY.FUCKING.IUD...  insert drunken hyperventilation.. OMG I pulled out my IUD.. It was just lying there in the corner like some aborted metal fishook al bloody and gross..

If you think my FU ends here.. think again.. Keep in mind it’s around 2/3 o’clock now.

In my panic I decide to call my mom (waking-up husband isn’t nessesary annymore couse sexytime is off the table!). My father answers the phone all sleepy, and I ask for my mom. “Well sweatie, we were sleeping, whatever it is, I can help you, no need to wake your mother.” Okay... 

IWantedToHaveSexytimeWithHusbandButImHavingMyPeriodITouhgtICouldntGetMyTamponOutButNowIPulledOutMyIUD... HELPPPPP!!!!  “......”  Daddy?  “......” “M. WAKE UP YOUR DAUGHTER NEEDS YOU!” 

So now I explained to my mother what happend and she managed to calm me down, and said I needed to call the HAP again. 
So I did, got the same nurse, explained what happend. She consulted with her collegue, and asked me some additional questions to find out if Im oké.. 

“Ma’am, are you shivvering?” Yes I am. “Can you decribe how bad?” Well I was in the shower, and now I’m standing in my bathroom all naked and wet for like 15 minutes now, so I’m getting kinda cold. 
“Okay, thats a good explanation, are you dizzy ma’am?” Yes I am dizzy. “Can you decribe how dizzy?” Well I drank like a bottle of wine, thats how dizzy I am.(Muffled laughter on the other end of the phone) “Well I guess thats okay also than. Are you bleeding down there?” Yes I am. “Okay sweety how bad is it?” Well I’m heaving my period, that is how bad it is.. “Oh yeah, I forgot, so that is normal also than.” 

She suggested to go to bed, and if I felt worse I could stop by, the fact that I pulled out my IUD wasn’t so different than when I would get it removed by a nurse, altough she tought that that “would have happend more gently” (no shit Sherlock).

There is still the mistery of The Lost Tampon.. I think drunk me pulled it out earlier at night, but I have no clue.

So for not letting go drunken sexytime, I’m now not gonna have sexytime for a few weeks till I get a new IUD. And because I didn’t want to hear “Yo pussy so big” jokes, now I’m gonna hear “Remember when you got so drunk and horny you pulled out your IUD” jokes forever. Not to mention my parents now know I like drunken sexytime.. So yeah I fucked up today..

TL;DR

Today I fucked up being on my period, getting drunk, and wanting sexytime. Mistake my IUD for my tampon, ripped it out after a 2 hour struggle, and woke up my parents to tell them I fucked up because I wanted to have dunken sexytime with husband. I did not get sexytime, nor will I get it for a few weeks."
3,"TIFU by sarcastically telling a “joke” to my teacher about his dead wife and son.


Reposted and deleted a couple times because my dumbass didn’t know how to put nsfw.

Went to school earlier today (high school) and while walking to class with my friend, I saw a teacher that I haven’t seen since winter break (school week is from Sunday-Thursday here, and it was the first day back from the break). I shook his hand and sarcastically said, “Heyyyyyyy Mr.______! How are the kids? How’s the wife?” And then he “playfully” slapped me on the back of my neck. Don’t know why but I just kept on walking to class.

Didn’t think anything of it until my friend pulls me to the side. He too smacked me on the back of my head. Told me that his wife died of disease (not sure which) a couple years ago...  and his only son was also killed in a motorcycle accident last year... 

Didn’t know what to say. Not like I can go up to him and say sorry I joked about your dead wife and son. I know that makes sense and it’s the right thing to do but I just couldn’t push myself to do it. Just went on with my day regretting saying those stupid fucking questions. Thankfully he didn’t even give a shit, so that made me feel a little better.

TL;DR- made a “joke” about my teachers wife and son, found out a minute later they’re both dead.

4,"TIFU By going on a date and being compared to Hitler


This didn’t actually happen today, it happened last year in high school. My previous girlfriend broke up with me three months ago and I felt like I was ready to get back on the horse. So, I asked this pretty girl out on a date and she said yes! She also warned me that she’s never been on a date before. 

The date started out great, We saw Guardian of the Galaxy two and she was laughing through the movie. She had a really cute laugh and I was enjoying it. After the movie I told her we can go get some dinner. This is where the date started to go down hill. I asked her what her favorite food was and I can pick a place that has that. She replied, “My favorite food is carbs.” How ever she didn’t just say “carbs”, she said “caaaaarbs”. So we go to noodles and company for her caaaaaarbs. As we talk the date gets worse. 

She tells me how she thinks that school is too easy and that people around her are usually more stupid than her. I thought that I was a people so I asked her “well I’m a people, how smart do you think I am?” She tells me that I’m 5.1/10 in intelligence and that was above average! Not only did she give me a low number, but she would lower it as the date went on. It ended at 4.6/10. In hindsight, I should have just left the date there but we decided to get ice cream. 

She started to talk about my best friend at the time and it sounded like she really admired him. I asked her if she had a crush on him and she replied “ooohhh yeah”. So on my date with her, I set her up with my best friend. This is the point when I decided that the date was bad and I should take her home. At this point I spent 50$ and had a shit time. 

On the ride home she said these exact words: “You know Chris, you really remind me of this guy in my book. This guy is really charismatic, you know like Hitler!” ..... I said, “did you just compare me to Hitler?” She says, “huh... I guess I did” and she left the car. 

TL;DR  I spent 50$ on a date to be a 4.6/10, set her up with my best friend, and was compared to Hitler. That’s a good sum up of my love life. "
5,"TIFU by eating Chili with carolina reaper peppers in it.


Posting from mobile. 
Tl;dr at the end.

This fuck up happened less than 20 minutes ago. I tried a bowl of chili made by a friend of mine. The friend asked if I was ok with spice, because this chili was a tad on the hot side. A tad? Two spoon fulls in and my mouth then became a suitable place for Frodo to destroy The Ring of Power. Did I stop there? Of course not. By the fifth spoon full I feel like my lips might actually start to bleed. I have that awkward spicy food tickle in the back of my throat. Things were going as well as they could be. Fast forward a few minutes.....

I'm finish the entire bowl. I can't really tell  how it tasted because my taste buds basically share similar qualities to an object at ground zero of a nuclear blast. My lips are still on fire and will remain that way for 10 more minutes. My throat is numb and I can feel what can only be described as a small camp fire sitting in my stomach making its way for the exit.  I'm currently laying on a couch uncomfortably  dreading the fate that now awaits me in the near future when I have to go to the bathroom.  

I currently trying to figure out how to have my sadistic friend sent to The Netherlands to stand trial at the Hague for the production and distribution of biological weapons. 

I hope I don't die on a toilet like Elvis did.

Tl;dr - ate a bowl of chili that is hot enough to power a nuclear reactor. Now I'm dying on a couch.

6,"TIFU By Meeting My Father's Mistress


TIFU by trying to be friendly, but instead learning a little more than I wanted to know. 

Flashback to about 1996 where my parents met in a rubber factory. A relationship blooms and my mom gets pregnant with me. Then when I was about 2, my parents split up. I never truly knew the reasoning, I was always told ""it just didn't work out"" but I was fine with that answer and never pressed. 

Flash forward to today, where I work in a store similar to a Sam's Club, meaning there is quite the variety in employees, including my own boyfriend (in a separate department). I have worked here for about 4 months, so I have started making friends and therefore accepting friend/follow requests on social media from other employees. Then I received one from a woman I did not know and I chose to ignore it. The next morning, however, she stops me and asks ""Are you Jane Doe?"" I say yes and ask how she knows that. She responds, ""Oh I used to know your dad! We worked together at this rubber factory! How has he been? Please tell him I say hello!"" 

Now, I'm not one for making a situation awkward by saying ""Sorry, my dad abandoned us about 20 years ago"" so I instead said ""Okay, no problem! He's been great..."" Now here is where I fuck up. Instead of leaving well enough alone I continue and ask, ""...but do you know my mom as well? She used to work there!"" And it all went downhill. She asked who my mother was and as soon as I said it she became uncomfortable and left. So when I got off of work I called my mom and asked her about the woman and she was very strange about everything too. To sum it up, yeah I was talking to my dad's mistress-the real reason thing went south with my parents. 

To make matters worse, my boyfriend and this woman work in the same department. She has been asking nonstop about my dad and hoping we could get her back in touch with him! So I have my dad's old lover constantly bothering my boyfriend about wanting me to reach out to him for god knows what reason and my mother upset and silent! 

TL;DR My dad left when I was very young, then about 20 years later I started working with the woman he had an affair with. Now she wants to contact him and my mom wants to kill me. "
7,"TIFU by Feeding my Dog


Hot and fresh, only 20 minutes old TIFU!   


So I wake up this morning having slept in on the weekend as is my wont. Like any male over the age of prepubescence I have awoke with a certain condition and decide to seek clarity in the less savory parts of reddit. However, as I turn to my my phone to find solace I note with dismay that it is 10 AM and my dog must be fed. Priding myself on my immeasurable self control and unquestionable adulting skills,  I trudge down the the stairs and let my dog out the back to handle his business. I grab his food dish to take to the garage where I keep his sustenance. Such was my hurry to get back to the aforementioned clarity search I quickly step into the garage......and into the blinding light of the outdoors. There I stand in my garage, both doors wide open(its a double), in my briefs, lil soldier standing at full attention with my elderly neighbors standing across the way dressed for church. I wish I could say I handled the situation with all the dignity and poise, but I am certain I let out a loud squeal like a little girls, immediately hit the garage door buttons and jumped back into my house until  I was sure the doors were fully closed. I think I need to move now. Anyone looking for a house in Kansas?  


The only reason I can imagine my both my garage doors being open is when I returned from errands last night instead of pushing the button for the open one I accidentally pushed the button for the closed one and never paid attention to what happened afterwards.  


TL;DR Tried to feed my dog, but accidentally flashed my neighbors when my garage doors were both unexpectedly opened."
8,"TIFU by also ordering underwear off Amazon


Inspired by the other post, this happened last week.

As part of a cosplay I'm working on, I (a dude) decided to buy a pair of (rather large) fake silicon boobs, and therefore a bra as well. Separate shipments, the former from eBay, the latter from Amazon. I get a notification that the bra arrived last week during the day, but there's no package when I get home. I check the shipment notification (since Amazon now gets drivers to take a picture of the package after drop-off), and it was obviously left at my neighbor's door. I go over there and don't see the package. I knock, but they aren't home anymore.

Then, I go back the next morning to ask if they have the package, but the one girl says she hasn't seen it, but will ask her roommate when she gets back. I then go about my day, and come home that evening to the package sitting at our door, opened, with a note inside saying ""sorry for opening this, I was expecting something a similar size"". No problem, I understand, and the inner packaging wasn't opened. No big deal, but I can't help but wonder what she now thinks about me. We're both guys, never had a girl around (so buying for a girlfriend isn't really a likely option), and suddenly there's a (rather large) bra in an Amazon package...

But hey, at least it fits well and looks great. 10/10 buying experience.

TL;DR: Am a dude. Bought a bra off Amazon, delivered and opened by neighbor who is a girl, expecting weird looks from now on. 10/10 buying experience."
9,"TIFU by messing with Google Messages


As a curious, all tech inspired individual, I have a natural tendency to poke around apps and explore their settings no matter how well my current setup is working. Today was different. Today I broke something.

Some background. I'm diehard Google Voice user and just recently moved to Google Fi which pulled in my GV number and so far, so good. Hangouts has been working as intended with SMS messages and Hangouts messages all flowing in and out.

In lieu of all the Google Hangouts news I've started exploring other apps like Google Messages and Google Duo. Normally this just means a trial to see what I think and then going back to Hangouts (praise be). However today something odd happened. I had just poked around Messages settings this morning while texting a friend with my Google Fi number. All of a sudden I hear the Messages chime, which hadn't happened since I had my old carrier number weeks prior. My brow furrowed, and I took a look at my phone. Sure enough, I had received two messages from my friend in the Messages app instead of Hangouts.

PANIC. Did Google just drop Hangouts off a cliff? Am I going to lose all my convo history? Or, worst of all, have to accept change?! Immediately I check Hangouts. It's still installed and still has all my prior SMS conversations (phew). Okay, good, Google didn't technologically ghost me, but now what? Concerned I ask my sister to text my Fi number. It rolls in on Messages. Crap, so it wasn't a fluke. I check out Messages setting again since I had been messing with it. It's currently set as the default SMS app, but that doesn't matter since I have Google Fi and Hangouts is set to receive all those SMS messages. I was properly stumped. Increasingly concerned, I furiously search for any recent news about Hangouts, Messages, Allo, Duo, anything that could have changed. I check updates and neither Messages nor Hangouts updated recently. Nothing. Alright, now what.

Hmm, time to look at the problem child again. Diving into the Hangouts settings, I ensure for the third time that the ""Project Fi calls and SMS"" option is properly enabled and it is. I figure why not toggle it, maybe a turn it on and off again approach will work. I have the sister test text me again and it slides in on Hangouts. WOO, SUCCESS! My mini crysis was averted.

So, lesson learned. Mess with the Default SMS app settings in Messages and you may lose your Google Fi to Hangouts SMS connection, but thankfully it's reversible (for now).


TL;DR Messed with Google Messages settings and accidentally started diverting Google Fi SMS's from Hangouts causing premature panic"
10,"TIFU by calling my girlfriend by my ex wife's name.


This is my first post. As is tifu tradition, this happened yesterday.

For context, I have been divorced a year from a what I truly believe to have been a sociopath. If there were any red flags before the marriage, I missed them completely. I thought she was incredible. It was like everything I wanted in a wife, she had to offer. Things rapidly changed after the marriage. Over the course of three years, the abuse progressed from verbal, emotional abuse to full on physical violence. I turned to drinking, and spent most of my free time inside a bottle. Wild turkey 101 was my poison.

After the divorce, I quickly sobered up, and am currently going back to school. I am getting my life back on track. My girlfriend and I have known each other since we were 14. We had a mutual crush back then, but nothing came of it until now. She literally treats me like a king, and she is my angel. She's helped me get sober, and has helped in every way imaginable. She's my best friend.

Now for the fuck up. My girlfriend is a med student, and this semester is proving to be trying for her. I left her apartment to go get her some food so when wouldn't have to stop studying. My girl hates Mayo. I know this, but I was in a hurry and forgot. I also had gotten her a shake. The cup was leaking, but I didn't notice. I had set it down on some important documents, and subsequently stained them with chocolate shake. My girlfriend, being the angel she is, didn't even get upset with me, but I got annoyed at myself for not paying attention. In my frustration I said, ""Dad gum it, Kristi!"" This is my ex wife's name, directed at my current girlfriend. Never before have I ever been so mortified. My angel stood there and teared up. That was a hard thing to see. I had no idea what to say other than I'm sorry and I don't know why I said that. My girlfriend is convinced she did something to remind me of my ex wife. I don't believe this to be true, but I don't know how to disprove it. I don't even know why I called her that!

So now I have to figure out a way to prove that she doesn't remind me of my ex. I'm still very much at a loss and am incredibly embarrassed.

TL;DR called my girlfriend the name of my abusive ex because I was frustrated over food.

11,"TIFU by getting hypnotized by Travis Scott


Obligatory this did not happen today, but last night. My friends and I are still confused as fuck about what happened. So I was staying over at my friend's house and per usual we were smoking bud. 2 woods and a few bong rips total, nothing crazy. The unusual aspect of the night was I was drinking. I don't get drunk very often, I've only ever been drunk five times in my life. I'm not against drinking I just don't have the option to drink that much. Throughout the night I had a water bottle's worth of white wine and half a water bottle of svedka and this combined with the wood and bong had me fucked. We were in my friend's cars smoking wood number 2 and listening to music. I was feeling pretty great, and then Out for the night- part 2  by 21 Savage ft. Travis Scott came on. I started giving with the song when the guitar transitioned into Travis's part. I don't have memory of this point onwards. I'm told I leaned slowly downward until I was resting on my friend Johnny. When I was there for more than a few seconds he pushed me off and up yelling ""yo what the fuck."" Then I paused and my body started convulsing. While I was shaking I started making sounds that I think would be spelled ""Eegh, Eegh, Eegh, Eegh."" After that I'm told I started looking around, off into the distance, and breathing heavily. They helped me out of the car and my memory comes back with my friend Andrew leading  me back to my friends basement. Our leading theory is that the music hypnotized me and my friend snapped me back awake.

TLDR: I was really fucked up and listening to music made me have a mini seizure."

14,"TIFU by Flying a Drone Indoors


\[Mandatory\] This happened about a month ago

It was a chilly day during my much anticipated winter break. My father had just bought some new equipment for his cinematography college, including, but not limited to: a few professional grade cameras, stage lights and most importantly a DJI Phantom 4 Pro (a pretty sizable filming drone).

Although my major has nothing to do with filming my father still likes to check freshly bought stuff out with me and my brother, so we started digging through things. Eventually we got to the drone and so the story begins...

We started calibrating the drone which took a few hours with all the software downloads/updates and the time came for our Phantom to take air. I want to emphasize that we were planning on flying it in the living room of our apartment which has a bit of headroom to it so we weren't really worried about anything going wrong, and in fact, nothing went wrong during the initial take-off.

Due to me being the one to assemble, calibrate and then set up the drone I was given the honor of flying it first. Everything was going smooth and the drone was soaring gracefully through our living room. After the initial test we started testing it with other batteries just in case any of them were faulty (my father tends to be a bit TOO thorough with these type of things). Just as we were about to test the last battery, the door rang and my father immediately told me and my brother to take the drone to his room. I had a friend coming over and knowing our generation my father figured that this friend of mine would want to mess around with the drone as well and the rest should make sense to you.

Me and my brother swiftly packed everything away as my father went to check the door, and it turned out to be our neighbor asking about some stuff. So, realizing that it was all a false alarm, I thought that it'd be a good idea to finish what we'd started and test out the last battery IN the office room, which, mind you, is barely a few square meters and is filled with filming equipment.

This is where things went out of hand...

Me, who thought he'd gotten good at flying a drone just by launching it a few times, decided to launch it once again in this puny little space. The drone took off with no problem and was hovering just fine a few meters in front of me. For those of you who don't know, Phantom has a built in ""failsafe"" which doesn't allow the drone to land on obstructed surfaces. So after thoroughly making sure that the battery was in fact working I commanded the drone to land.

But it refused...

I was swiftly prompted with a message saying that the area is not safe for landing. I didn't think much of it as the drone was still in one place holding tight. I tilted the stick on the controller aiming to move it away from the ""obstructed area"" but much to my avail it the drone wouldn't budge. I was keeping calm until it started slowly but surely moving towards the nearby desk on an inevitable collision course. At that moment my only thought was how upset my father would be with me if I crashed this fresh new drone on the very first day of its use. I was trying to move it with the controller, but it just wouldn't listen.

Realizing that the controller wouldn't comply with me at this point I decided to take things into my own hands. As stupid as it is, I reached to the center of the drones top and started holding it in place with my fingers barely avoiding all four of the furiously spinning blades. The drone was resisting big time as it's calibrated to stay in one optimal position, which I was forcefully pushing it out of.

My brother stood speechless next to me as all of this was happening clueless as to what to do. I tell him to hold the controller while I try dealing with this problem (or rather try holding the drone while I thought of something to do myself). As I released the controller from my right hand I tried putting it next to my left hand, which I was holding the bloodthirsty drone down with skimming one of propellers in the process. In that moment I didn't think much of it. It was like a quick sting, a momentary pain that went away as fast as it happened.

I continued holding the drone down with my left hand alone as my father, who wasn't in the room previously, ran in seeing what situation I had gotten myself into instantly grabbing onto the landing gear of the drone freeing me of my awkward position. This let me take a breather and look around for a potential solution. And this is when I suddenly glimpsed my right hand... boy was it a sight...

My hand was dripping with blood. Streams of it were coming off of my fingertips. Now... I'm the guy who thought that the amount of blood shown in movies is exaggerated and a human body would never bleed THAT much... but this incident made me reevaluate my understanding of the circulatory system. Realizing that my fingers had just been cut open by a drone I muttered ""fuck..."" and went back to thinking of how to stop this killer robot. Thinking back at it I didn't panic whatsoever, which is surprising given the intensity of the situation. On one side of the room I have my dad in a wrestling match against a flying drone the size of a hawk and on the other I'm standing with my hand mangled and blood all over the floor. Let's just say I kept a pretty clear mind.

And at this moment I knew what had to be done. I'd have to go for the beasts heart if i wanted to end this once and for all. With a plan in my head I immediately started acting on it. I approached the drone and with my right hand, the very one that this monster cut open so effortlessly, I reached to the back of the drone, barely avoiding the two rear propellers, grabbed onto the battery, pushed the safety lock buttons and pulled that sunovabitch out... and so the beast was no more. The propellers came to a halt as the monster drew it's last breath now resting lifeless in my fathers arms. Not gonna lie... it really felt like I had just defeated a monster. The victory was exhilarating, but my triumph came to a sudden stop as my parents immediately rushed toward me, seeing how I was bleeding all over the room.

Even after the fact I didn't think much of my wound. After a thorough examination I deduced that a large portion of my index finger's nail was missing, I had chunks of meat missing from the top sides of my middle and ring fingers, and had large gashes on the tips of my ring finger and pinkie. Thank god all of the fingers were in place. That was the only thing I was worried about initially. But the pain came in after the adrenaline had settled. It didn't hurt much but I wasn't able to use my fingers properly for about a week and a half.

Fast forward to about a month and my fingers are feeling good as new. Still have small scars where the gashes were and the missing chunks were regenerated into bright red flesh, but the nail has managed to grow out seamlessly.

The main takeaway for me would be that drones are not to be treated as toys. Those things can cut open humans like butter, which I learned the hard way.

Hope you enjoyed my misfortune as much as I did!

TL;DR: Flew a large drone indoors, ended up damaging my hand pretty bad.

15,"TIFU by trying to help my MIL try edibles


This happened last Thursday. 

So, my SO had back surgery on Friday (he’s recovering very well!) and his mom came in on Thursday to stay with us so that I could go back to work today. A quick tidbit about her - she’s had several back and knee surgeries over the years. She’s pretty sturdy, but a lot of activity will leave her drained and sore by the end of the day. Because of this, she’s been experimenting with marijuana *a tad*. Sometimes her friend will give her a Rice Krispie Treat, and she’ll take small punches of it to really make it last. My SO talked to her about medical marijuana over Christmas, and she expressed interest. 

SO had the wonderful idea to have her try it with us while she was here for his surgery. He decided to get edibles instead of actual flowers for her, because he was afraid the coughing would scare her off. He ended up buying these lemon gummy squares that are about 1.5 cubic in. Dosing is 1/4th. Now, I’ve had these before, and they’re pretty strong. 1/2 is enough to wipe me out for the rest of the day. But they taste great, and they work well. 

So his mom arrives, and almost immediately asks about it. We start talking, and I hand her a bag with one of the squares in it. I’m talking to her while I’m cleaning the kitchen, and explaining to her what it is, what it’ll do, how long it’ll take to kick in, etc. I get to the part where I’m telling her how much to eat, and I turn around to look at her. 

She’s chewing. The bag is empty. She ate the whole thing. 

I immediately internally freak out, but try to remain as calm as possible on the inside. I call over to my SO, because I have no idea how to explain to this woman what’s just happened. I can see the internal freakout happening for him, too, but he’s much less reserved than I. He asks her why she ate the whole thing, to which she replies “I don’t know! It was good though”. He tells her it was entirely too much, and suggests that they go get coffee. He drives, of course. 

They come back not 20min later. Apparently it all hit her at once inside the coffee shop (great idea, babe) and he had to rush her home. She slept for 7hrs, which ate up any time we had left to prepare for the surgery. She also can’t find her main car key, but luckily has a square. She’s taken small hits off of a vape pen here and there since then, but it doesn’t seem like she fully understands why it hit her so ferociously, and now may be afraid of actually trying it in the future. She also says she didn’t feel normal until Sunday. 

Tl:Dr: tried to introduce MIL to edibles, handed her a full edible before telling her how much to eat, she slept for 7hrs and wasn’t able to help us prepare for SO’s surgery. "

17,"TIFU By finding photos of one of my teachers online and sharing them with my friends


So I'm a highschool student, and as I feel like any student does, I google my teachers occasionally - this time around, I googled the name of a teacher I have in the upcoming semester and found several photos of him in various cosplay outfits - mostly harmless stuff, but a few of him shirtless and a few of him dressed up as an anime school girl. Being the teenage boy I am, I found these hilarious and sent them to a few close friends a few days ago and thought nothing of it. Come the start of this week, and they've spread like wildfire around the school, literally everyone with an instagram or snapchat has probably seen them.


At some point this week, our schools administration got wind of this, found the photos, and it appears they've fired the poor guy. His name has been scrubbed from any page on our schools website, and his classroom seems to be totally cleaned out, leaving anyone in his classes this semester totally high and dry with exams right around the corner. 


TL;DR: Found pictures of a teacher looking cute in a schoolgirl outfit, accidentally had them spread around, admin found out and fired him."
