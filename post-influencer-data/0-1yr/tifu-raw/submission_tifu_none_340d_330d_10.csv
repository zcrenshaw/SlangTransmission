1,"TIFU by cumming on my doctor


This happened ages ago but it's an absolute ridiculous story so figure I would share. I was 18 at the time - young, dumb, and full of cum. My parents just went away on vacation, I had the house to myself. What better way to spend your alone time than getting some jerk off sessions in, being a teen and all.

Must have went at it a solid two or three times that day, but my last one was 30 minutes before I had to go to my pediatrician for a physical. Yes, I was 18 seeing my pediatrician from childhood, too lazy/stupid that I should probably have changed doctors by then. Get there, go through the normal routine of paper work and waiting until being called to the room. Finally, Doctor comes in and all of a sudden shit starts to go down hill.

The doc has seen me a million times, so she is always quick with petty shit like physical exams/vaccines. She goes through the normal physical, she listens to my heart and lungs, feels my abdomen. Says she needs to check my balls to make sure puberty went well.

FUCK, I remember I didn't do a good job of cleaning up myself after the last jerk off session. All im praying is that theres not like dried up jizz in my underwear. She asks me to hop off the exam table, and pull down my undies. I pull my underwear down, and boy did I fuck up. There was still a tiny bit of jizz stored away. I look down and I cant believe what the fuck im seeing., There is a string of jizz hanging from my dick to my underwear.

I can feel things getting awkward, my doctor uses her hands (has gloves on) to wipe my dangling jizz away. She then proceeds to say ""sexually active I see""..... my genius response.....""NO!""

TL;DR By jerking off and leaving jizz in my pants for my doctor to find; then denying my sexually activity."
2,"TIFU by buying a fake ticket to a concert in college


I am a college student and each Spring we have a Concert that is free granted you get to the ticket booth before they sell out. My lazy ass waited until the last day. There were no tickets left. Fuck. 

&amp;#x200B;

So I heard a few people were selling tickets, and this very overweight indian kid was one of them and I bought a ticket off him for $40. So I get extremely shit faced with my friends before the concert and head over. After waiting in line we finally get to the man checking tickets and he scans mine and tells me it's fake...I'm shocked and now I'm shitfaced and alone with nothing to do for three hours. So I head back to my dorm room and voice my outrage in a drunk email to the president of the University. Obviously not my wisest decision.  I typed it in five minutes and hit send - no edits.

&amp;#x200B;

Surprisingly he emails me back in the morning and tells me the only option I have is to make a statement with the police which I didn't do because I just wanted my $40 back. So I call and text the guy and he doesn't pick up or respond. After a few weeks I'm starting to get pissed.

&amp;#x200B;

Then one day I went to my professor's office because I had a calculus exam coming up. Who do I see on my way there? Overweight indian kid. I asked him why he hadn't answered me, and he says he had been and he was wondering why I hadn't answered him. He shows me the text messages he had been sending me, and then I take out my phone showing him that I wasn't receiving his messages. Once I hand him my phone I start to panic. I forgot that I had put him in my phone as ""fat fuck"" because I didn't know his name. So now he's looking at my phone with ""fat fuck"" written across the top of the screen as his name. He sees it immediately. This dude weighs at least 350 pounds. He looks a bit like the wrestler rikishi, and the last thing I wanted before my meeting with my professor was the stink face. So he looks at it, looks at me, and then throws $40 at me and walks away. We never made eye contact again.

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR: I bought a fake ticket for my college spring concert. I called and texted the guy who sold to me and eventually saw him at office hours. He shows me that he has been texting me and I show him that I haven't been receiving them, forgetting that I saved him in my phone as ""fat fuck""..."
3,"TIFU - By eating a whole bird's-eye chilli


NB: This happened a few weeks ago.

&amp;#x200B;

On one Saturday, me, my brother, my sister and one of our good friends decided to go on a bike ride to an afternoon tea place with a farm there. We first ordered some cake, but had to go in an emergency. We came back later on, they gave us our cake, and everything was fine there. So we decided to go to the farm area and have a look around. Immediately, we spot the chillies. The lady running the stall says ""The red ones are the hottest"", so, naturally, we choose to each eat a red one. These were bird's-eye chillies (875,000 Scoville Heat Units). On the count of 3, we each put it in our mouths (a whole one each!). We then chewed it up, and my brother and sister both spit it out immediately. Me and the friend both swallow it, and good god was that a mistake! It started to burn like hell, as if I'd just eaten fire! We ended up crying, with me on the floor at one point. We were choking. The lady gave us a bottle of water at once. Each of us drank some. (In case you didn't know, water makes chilli heat worse!). The heat was proper bad now! It was the worst pain I'd ever experienced (and I've sliced a huge chunk of skin off my kneecap before!). The heat lasted for 15 minutes before it died down, and we started to ride back home. That, never again!

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR - Me, brother, sister and a good friend each ate a red bird's-eye chilli, me and the friend swallowed it, brother and sister spat out. It burned for 15 minutes, and we were crying and choking."
4,"TIFU By using Siri Shortcuts


I was using the new app on iOS 12 called shortcuts. For people who don’t know it’s an app that can create automated tasks and makes them a simple press of a button or voice command via Siri. It used to be called workflow then Apple took over and updated it with new features. There’s been quite a number of people showing off their shortcuts on reddit and I was looking through these, one of them I wanted to use was a morning routine. I’ve downloaded this shortcut on my phone and then began to edit it to my liking for my morning routine. One of those things was to message my girlfriend good morning as I’m normally up before her. So as I’ve set this up I’ve decided to test it but instead of putting my girlfriend as the recipient I’ve put myself just to test it was all working. Except I didn’t. I’ve selected my new landlord who happens to have the same as me (Matt) I’ve not looked properly just seen Matt and selected that. So my landlord had a message at 3pm in the afternoon saying “Morning babe”

I’ve immediately apologised and tried to explain. I hope he sees the funnier side!

I’ve mainly shared this as this kind of situation normally makes me feel so embarrassed but I’d rather see the funnier side of it now

tl;dr making a siri shortcut to message my girlfriend but messaged landlord morning babe"

6,"TIFU by complimenting my girlfriends art


Throwaway account for obvious reasons to come, this happened yesterday...

&amp;#x200B;

So my girlfriend had been working on something for Inktober and wasn't happy with some of the colours to which I said 'they compliment each other very nicely, you've got all the primary colours here- well a couple of the primary colours' to which she had a very perplexed look on her face. She asked what I meant so I pointed to the blue and red and mentioned those then said something along the lines of 'the yellow obviously not being so but I think it works nicely anyway'. Right then her face totally changed, 'Yellow IS a primary colour!'. I got perplexed and said 'what do you mean, it's red, green and blue', which I said knowing I was actually wrong and suddenly realising that I had reached my late 20s having been wrong about everyday preschool basics. As it turns out I did not know that pigments and light worked differently with colour and I always assumed, possibly from using computers since I was very young, that it was red, green and blue.

&amp;#x200B;

The laughter that erupted from her was uncontrollable, in an instant I had made up for her having a crappy work week and feeling down, but I would have to come to terms with yellow, blue and red which still sounds wrong in my mind.....

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR, didn't know the primary colours and found out the hard way in front of my gf"
7,"TIFU by not checking what is in my washing machine.


Today was meant to be a nice and relaxing afternoon with my small family, watching movies and chilling with each other as it is the weekend and everyone is off of work. 

My mum and step-dad we're up early doing chores while me and my brother were asleep until 11 in the morning or so. We wake up and go downstairs for breakfast etc etc... all of the usual stuff while they are busy tiding up the house ahead of a good day. 

Meanwhile we have 3 cats, one has been with us for a little more than a year. The other is a small cat who was born around 3 months ago or so and has already unfortunately lost his mother due to being hit by a car. This happened quite recently; around 3 weeks ago. We love our cats and it was a sad experience. The other last cat we have is a newborn kitten with around 6 weeks, cute little thing.

So after we have breakfast my mum tells us how crazy it was this morning and that they had found the newborn kitten sleeping in our washing machine, and told us to be careful and check every time we put clothes in.

Ughh...

Fast forward an hour and she goes out to get some groceries for the house, and i finish up washing the rest of the dishes in the kitchen while listening to loud music. She then comes back home and tells us she cant find the kitten anywhere and we all start looking for over half an hour. Still no sign of her. My mum then realises she had put in a new batch of clothes in the machine before she left and is overly worried that she had done a big big mistake. I tell her that's highly unlikely and that we keep looking for 5 minutes then check the machine as we were all scared of. 

&amp;#x200B;

After all of that searching we gave up and eventually gave in to our biggest fear. My step dad opens the door and starts taking out the clothes, all of us flinching to what he may find. Low and behold he yells out a ""Oh my god, Fuck!"" My mum and I laugh as he is the person to joke around with serious things, until he swore on his kids and we got shell shocked and broke down. Such a silly accident costed the life of our amazing little kitten:(

&amp;#x200B;

We are still mourning over her and my mum is still broken to pieces over this. I understand that this isn't exactly my TIFU but it still is as i came down as she put the machine on and i put on my loud speakers, maybe i could've heard a thump in the machine or something, I'm not sure:(

I'm also sorry that I'm posting this devastating TIFU when most of the time the ones we see are funny ones. This justifies that even the things we don't think will happen, can indeed happen. Please try and keep your loved pets safe:( We have lost 2 of our pets in less than a month and feel quite broken after it all.

I also apologise if i don't make much sense, I'm very sad at the moment but i thought I might as well post this as i still have clear memory of what happened.

&amp;#x200B;

TL:DR: Mum forgot to check what was in the washing machine, and I turned on very loud music while my kitten was stuck in the washing machine."
