0,"TIFU by giving my son permission to beat his bully’s ass.


My son was born with a condition called Pectus Excavatum. In layman’s terms, his chest is sunken in. His condition was so bad that he only had two and a half inches between his sternum and his spine and his heart and lungs were bruised because of it. In December, he had surgery to correct it and they put two nickel bars in his chest to give it space and train his bones to grow correctly. 

About three weeks after his surgery, a kid punched him and dislodged the top bar and he had to have another surgery to put the bar back in place. The kid has been through a lot. 

Well, the doctor cleared him for most activity last week, just no skateboarding or bike riding but he could now lift his backpack and go hang out with friends and play pick up, non contact sports. Unbeknownst to me, a kid in his class had been bullying him all semester. And because my son was afraid of getting hit again, he just took it. Well, the evening he was cleared he came to me and said, “Dad, I’m cleared now. A kid has been bullying me and hitting me for months. Can I kick his ass?” Well, my son isn’t really a fighter. He’s fought with his brothers but never anyone else, and he’s always gotten his ass kicked. So I just figured he was just talking. But this is the first I had heard about the bullying and I was concerned. I could tell he was distressed about the situation so I told him to knock the fucker out. He just nodded and went to his room. 

Now, his older brother is s tough SOB. He had a traumatic brain injury two years ago and he missed a year of school so he’s in the same grade and coincidentally takes the same class. I talked to him about it and told him to handle it but don’t get in trouble. He told me that the kid walks in every day and punches my son in the head. I asked him why he allowed that to happen and he said he wanted his brother to get tough and once he was tired of getting hit, he would do something about it. While I kinda agree with his thinking, I instructed him to handle it without getting in trouble. 

The next morning I took them both to school then drove back home to get my younger daughter who goes to a different school that starts later. On the way to take her to school, my wife calls me. “Have you taken xxxxx to school yet? Well, after you do, go pick up your son. He got in a fight.” I just assumed it was my oldest son. Imagine my surprise when I walked into the school office to see my younger son with a grin from ear to ear! He was beaming! He pointed to another kid sitting in a chair holding an ice pack on his face. “I warned him.” I was so proud. 

He had walked into class, sat down, and the kid popped him in the head like always. My older son got up to intervene and before he could, my son decked the kid with one punch. He said the kid was bawling on the floor and that it was the best day of his life. He got suspended for three days. 

TL;DR I gave my son permission to beat up his bully because I didn’t think he would and he did it."
1,"TIFU by chilling at my friend's place while she wasn't home


My friend Jenna moved into a nice, new condo last month and I finally got a chance to check it out for the first time today.  I ended up arriving before she got home from work so she told me to let myself in with the spare key under the potted plant and to make myself comfortable.  

I made myself a sandwich and was meandering around eating and checking out her swanky new place when the front door opened and a really large and unfamiliar man with a duffel bag came in.  Dude was intimidating and I'm a tiny 4'11"" woman so I was immediately scared.  He looked shocked to see me.  I'm looking at his duffel bag and realizing that I surprised some piece of shit burglar! 

I panicked and threw my sandwich at his face and then locked myself in the bedroom.  I'm shaking and he pounds on the door yelling at me to get the fuck out.  I start screaming at HIM to get the fuck out and that I'm calling the police (total bluff because I didn't have my phone.)  He then yells back that HE is calling the police on ME.  This gives me pause.  At this point, I look around and realize the bedroom I'm in definitely appears to be of the male persuasion.  I ask him through the door if he knows Jenna (last name).  He tells me yes, she is his next door neighbor.  WELL.  Apparently, Jenna's neighbor ALSO keeps a spare key under a potted plant.  

So, today I fucked up by letting myself into my friend's neighbor's place, smacking him in the face with his own sandwich and then screaming at him to get the fuck out of his house.  

TL;DR Today I fucked up by assuming someone was a burglar."
2,"TIFU by ejaculating in front of my girlfriend's mother


Now this TIFU didn't happen today, it was a couple of weeks ago and I am still struggling to come to terms with the embarrassment, for both me and my girlfriend.

So, a few weeks ago I was at my GF's house, usually the plan when I go is I sit around with her parents for around 30mins-1hr or so with just general chatting etc then we go off to her room to watch TV, play games and other stuff. Everything was normal, I chat to her parents then go up to her room with her and start watching general TV.

This is where the fuck up happens.

After around an hour or so, me and my GF were bored and she was feeling pretty horny today (not normal behaviour, especially whilst her parents are home) and begins to undress me and start giving me a handjob.

I'm enjoying this more than I ever have, most likely because of the risk factor involved with her parents being home, which just made it feel so much better. Although the risk wasn't huge, because her parents have never disturbed us once since I started going there, they just leave us to it but still, the slight risk just made it feel really good.

She starts kissing my chest, them down to my waist and then starts sucking my dick. Literally within less than 30 seconds, I'm already ready to release my load, I try to get her to slow down and stop to save my embarrassment from prematurely ejacating but I just can't, it feels too good. 

Right on queue, her door starts to open so my girlfriend quickly stops, in walks her mother to ask us a question about going out for dinner together... she instantly gets an eye full of my girlfriend on her knees on the bed next to my dick whilst I'm there in my birthday suit. My girlfriend stopped too late though, so whilst she's staring at her mum in shock who's staring at both of us in even more shock I release my load all over my body in front of both of them, and she wasn't even sucking my dick at the time. Not only was it a ruined orgasm, her mother also got to see the final credits. Her mother didn't even say a word, she just walked back out and closed the door behind her.

I sit there completely naked, covered in my own cum in just pure embarrassment. My girlfriend went to get me tissue to sort myself out and then I hid in her room until they had gone to sleep and it was time to leave.

Although me and my GF are still together, I haven't been back or spoken to them since :(

TL;DR - GF was giving me a blowjob whilst her mother walked in, she stopped but it was too late and I ejaculated all over myself in front of both her and her mother, whilst in my birthday suit."
3,"Tifu by drastically overestimating how much weight someone could gain in a short span of time.


So for a bit of a light hearted break from all those creepy incest posts- this actually happened yesterday but I am ready to laugh about it now.
           
     Theres this other mom at my daughters daycare, and she is hot to trot. She looks like a buff version of morena baccarin (sp?) and to top it off shes super cool and fun to talk to. I don't really know her outside of drop off/pick up time but we're always friendly and make basic chit chat when we see one another- smile, say good morning, comment on parenting, etc.
      Well I recently had a pretty drastic schedule change at work and my husband became the primary daycare drop off/pick up for about 2 weeks while we all adjusted. Things settled down and I was able to start being the primary again, and a few days ago I saw hotpants lady- she was still her beautiful self, but had put on about 50lbs- I was astonished, she was always ultra fit, how on earth did she do that in 2 weeks? To top it off when I said hi the first morning I was back she barely made eye contact with me and just gave me a half smile and curt nod. I asked my husband if he noticed the change and he said he just thought maybe her recent switch from workout clothes to big dresses were making her look bigger. Maybe? No, she was definitely more voluminous. I spent 2 more days trying to catch her eye and facing chilly disposition and I finally decided to try and reinitiate friendly conversation with her. 

Me: ""Hey, I haven't been here for a while, good to see you again! You been feeling ok?""
Her: ""Oh, yeah, but I haven't been here in months.""
Me: (not catching on) ""Oh? Haha, everything is such a blur with kids, I never know what day it is anymore""
Her: ""I suppose, but I wouldn't know, I only watch my nephew when my sister is out of town.""
Me: (realization hitting like a thunder clap) ""oh, OH! So you're..."" 
Her: *angrilly interupting* ""Yes, I'm the fat twin. I've seen you staring at me trying to figure that out.""
She just sort of stalked off, leaving me mortified- and now I've got to put my husband back on daycare duty for several days to avoid the humorless wench who has clearly been eating all the chips on her shoulder. 

TL;DR: I didn't see this sexy fitness goddess at daycare for a fortnight and assumed she had put on an amazing amount of weight- only to be snapped at by her plushy twin."
4,"TIFU My parents ate my cannabis cake


 So here's the deal, my friends and I made a cannabis cake containing 8g of good flower. So I kinda forgot about it and left a piece in the fridge, to my surprise I come home today and the piece is gone.

What should I tell them. Or should I tell them at all? They are anti cannabis.

Help.

Update: My father found a joint in the ash tray and I just said it's from my friends. He said that cannabis is a shit drug and doesn't want me to smoke this ""shit"". Well if he would know that he just had a piece of ""shit"" cake...

Update 2: My father is going around our house with a candle and Christian church songs. I'm holding my laugh back

Update 3: My mom just made burgers for us and my dad never ate a single one apart from those like from McDonald's (2 times). He said that it's the most delicious thing he has ever eaten.

&amp;#x200B;

TL:DR: my parents ate my cannabis infused cake and my father is having a good time"
5,"TIFU by swiping on lesbians on Tinder for 2 months.


This has been going on for two months and I just found out today. Throwaway account because many know my real account and I don’t feel like getting roasted for 3 years about this. 

So I signed up for tinder after breaking up with my girlfriend a few months ago. I set up my account...set my interest in ‘women’ and started swiping. Now when I signed up for tinder I linked my Facebook account and apparently my dumbass 13 year old self thought it would be funny if I set my gender to woman. I had completely forgot, so for two months I was swiping on lesbians. I’m not a terrible looking guy and have had success on other apps, but I was getting barely any matches and couldn’t figure out why. Figured the algorithms were just screwing me. Over the course of the two months I would think “wow short hair must be the new thing” or “so many bisexuals on here” but never really thought anything beyond that. Then this morning I woke up to a new match. She said I looked great, to which I replied thanks, you too! But then she replied with...”how long ago did you transition?” I thought she was talking about puberty...but she was not. That’s when it all came together and I realized I’ve been swiping on lesbians the entire time.

Tldr; My 13 year-old self is an asshole."
6,"TIFU watching incest porn


*Throwaway account because that's where this fuck up deserves to be buried.* 

This happened yesterday. I was watching porn on my phone, one of those daddy/daughter videos. I will state, for the record, I do not advocate incest. My girlfriend however was all about that role play life and wanted me to be in ""bad dad"" mode when she sees me this weekend. All I wanted was to be the best bad dad she ever had, so I went on pornhub for some incest-inspiration. That's all this was. Research. 

So, the ""daughter"" was just about to climb on the cock that supposedly spit her ass out when all of a sudden my own fucking father phones me. Of all people. If there was a camera in my room, that would have been that moment I look straight into it. I answered the phone. The old man said he needed me to come pick him up at the airport because my brother, who was supposed to fetch him, wasn't answering his damn phone.

Cut to my dad and I driving home, catching up, roasting each other, you know, wholesome father/son shit. Then, there came the silence. It wasn't the awkward kind. But I guess we just kinda said enough at the time. My father, who's super religious btw, took the silence as an opportunity to switch on the car radio and tune in to his favourite gospel station. He was in the mood to get jiggy with Jeezy. But instead of hearing voices worshipping the OG upstairs, we heard the distinct sounds of bodies smacking against each other, moans of pleasure, and of course, the coital Q&amp;A: 

*""You like fucking me don't cha, daddy?""* 

*""Arrrrggggghhhh.... yeah... ""* 

My old man unknowingly activated the car's Bluetooth, which immediately connected to my phone, and began playing whatever I was listening to last. In this case, it was fucking incest porn. Now, I never closed the video before I left the house, but I did pause the motherfucker. Yet, somehow, my phone went Skynet all over my dumbass ass and auto played that traumatic shit.

I frantically turned off the ""radio"" and did what I do best in extremely uncomfortable situations, prevent eye contact at all cost. 

Dad: Suppose that's one way of bringing up the birds and the bees conversation with your kids. 

Me: 

I immediately contemplated crashing the car just to escape the cringy silence between me and my dad for the rest of the drive home. 

^^Siri ^^might ^^have ^^sabotaged ^^me

**TL:DR Drove my dad home. Accidentally blasted incest porn over the Bluetooth speaker. The end.**"
7,"TIFU by ruining a happy family.


Like all good TIFUs, this didn’t happen yesterday.

My wife and I went to one of our favorite restaurants in town a couple weeks ago.  It’s just a bar and grill on the lake shore where you can sit outside right next to the water.  Whenever the weather is nice, we love sitting out there and enjoying a couple beers with dinner.

One of our favorite parts about sitting out there is the wildlife.  From our spot, you can look into the water and see fish swimming around and ducks love hanging out there.  I assume people toss fries or whatever for the ducks, so they made this area an official hangout.

On this particular evening, my wife and I were the only ones eating outside and we saw a pair of ducks (a drake and a hen) swimming offshore.  I thought it would be fun to pull up YouTube and make duck noises.  I found a video that had a couple different duck calls, so I started playing it.  Lo and behold, the ducks responded.  At first they started by making the call back to me, but gradually, they moved closer and closer.  They ended up on-shore and only a few feet away.  It was a pretty fun experience.  That is, until it got out of hand.

Apparently my phone was loud enough for other ducks to hear, because another drake swooped in.  This other drake had no interest in me, however.  He immediately went for the hen.  This led to a fight between the two drakes.  They started yelling (quacking) at each other and eventually flew off and chased each other around the lake with the hen following them.  Unfortunately, the original drake did not win the mating fight and the new drake flew off with the hen.

My wife and I stared at each other in disbelief as this whole thing played out.  She still jokingly calls me a home-wrecker, and I suppose that’s fair.

I’m not really super torn up about it.  In fact, I find the whole situation kind of amusing.  I thought this more light-hearted TIFU belonged here.

TL;DR:  Went to dinner and played duck calls.  Called in another drake and ruined a family."
8,"TIFU: My friend brought her new date over for dinner and I jokingly vetted him in front of everyone by asking if’d ever killed anyone. He said yes.


As it’s often the case, this didn’t happen today, but a few years ago when I was maybe 15yo, young and naive.

My mom’s best friend back then was V, a young woman in her late-30s, the widow of a really great man that had died a few years earlier, too young, because of a disease.

V is a bright, intelligent, well-mannered and good-looking woman. After losing her husband and mourning his death for a long time, she started dating again. She brought to our home a few men over the years.

One of those times, V had invited over for dinner a man (let’s call him A) who she introduced to us as a “good friend”. A was a middle-aged man originally from Bosnia. He now lived in my hometown and run his construction business.

For those of you not fully aware of Bosnia and the things that happened there, brief history lesson. It’s a small country in the Balkans (Eastern Europe, north of Greece), and it used to be part of the former Jugoslavia. Long story short, in the 1990s a civil war broke out there, and things got really, really ugly, many were murdered, and many fled, including A.

That evening, at dinner we were all trying to get to know A better. He seemed a nice, soft-spoken man, mature, and with a lot of experience on his shoulders. We start asking him questions about how long he’s been out of Bosnia, etc.

I start to think of something witty to say to “vet” him. Something funny.

I asked him if he’d ever killed someone, jokingly.

He looked at me, all serious. He said yes. Everyone became silent.

He went on to explaining that during the war he had to make some difficult actions a couple of times. They were those situations where it was either his life (and the lives of his beloved ones), or the other person’s.

I felt horrible for asking this. When I thought I was just making a joke, I opened up some really painful memories. Things that were not easy for him. Still today, many years later, i can’t imagine how he must feel living with such memories. And it was also the first time young me started to realize what war actually is, how it impacts real people around us.

After a short moment in which everyone was trying to cope with strong emotions, the dinner slowly went back to normal. We never spoke about that again.

—

TL;DR: I thought I’d make a funny joke and ask my friends’ date at dinner if he’d ever killed anyone. Turns out, he did during the civil war in former Jugoslavia, to save his and his loved ones lives. The joke became immediately too serious and thinking about it still makes me uncomfortable to this day."
9,"TIFU by going to my parents house, and now I need to bleach my eyes.


Literally happened ten minutes ago, the fallout has yet to happen.


Bit of a backstory, I (26M) live about 45 minutes from my parents house, and my eldest sister (30F) lives across the street from me but works close to my rents.


My parents, and my youngest sister (15F) are out of town on vacation. Now, I generally go to my parents house to work on my truck (my dad has spent a lot of money on his truck, and thus has a well stocked garage. Plus I live in an apartment complex and don’t have a garage).


So I’m going over there to do a few things, put some braided stainless brake lines on, and do an oil change.


This is where it happens. Now, my parents have two dogs. And I was trying to sneak into the house and being as quiet as possible, as I knew my eldest sister was house sitting and I didn’t want them to lose their shit.


This is where the fuckup happens.


It works. I’m quiet. I sneak into the house, and silently close the door. I heard some strange noises coming from the living room, so I go, thinking the dogs were playing.


It was not the dogs playing.


It was, in fact, my sister and her boyfriend. On the couch.

With her sitting on his lap facing away from him, towards me with her eyes closed.


I have now seen my sisters birthday suit being penetrated by her boyfriend.


I also now know what my sisters face looks like in this process. 


And what she sounds like.


I literally screamed “my eyes” covered them and ran out of the house.


I’m outside, sitting in my truck contemplating my life.


Send help.



TL;DR Parents home is vacant other than my sister dog sitting. Went to work on my truck, saw my sister getting worked on, reverse cowgirl style."
10,"TIFU when my best mate changed his name in my phone to ""sexy jess from work""


So several years ago my best mate todd changed his name in my phone too ""sexy jess from work"" and then would ring my phone in the middle of the niggt to try and get me in trouble with my partner. But she was friends with him before we had even gotten together so she recognized his number and his prank didnt really  work out.

Fast forward 6 or 7 years to the weekend just passed.
Im sitting on the couch watching tv and my partner is upstairs my 8 year old daughter is bored so i give her my phone to play a game on.

Que fuck up.
I never changed todds name back. Its been a running joke between us for years.
So ""sexy jess from work"" calls whilst my daughter has  my phone. She freaks out. Comes running into the lounge room crying throws my phone at me and screams ""i hate you dad!"". She runs off upstairs.
So im sitting there really confused. After a few seconds i follow her upstairs. I can hear her crying then i hear my partner start laughing hysterically.
Now im really confused. I get to the bedroom. My partner just  holds up my phone showing a missed call from ""sexy jess from work"". I piece together whats happened and spend the next 20 minutes explaining to my daughter and calming her down then call todd back to tell hin how his joke has made it to the next generation.

Tldr : buddy saved his name in my phone too ""sexy jess from work"" several years ago as a joke. Today my daughter sees it freaks out and thinks im cheating on hwr mother.

Sorry for formatting on mobile."
11,"TIFU by swiping on my girlfriend’s phone NSFW [UPDATE]


So some of you may remember my original post where I accidentally saw pictures of my girlfriend sucking the biggest dick I’ve ever seen:

https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/bo6nut/tifu_by_swiping_on_my_girlfriends_phone_nsfw/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app

I’ve had had thousands of messages asking for an update, and a similar amount of messages asking for the pictures (I don’t have them and I don’t want to see them again).

The truth is there isn’t much of an update because I never confronted her about it. I decided that it was my problem not hers, and that this may be one of those rare occasions where it would be more healthy for our relationship to leave the past in the past.

Our sex life is back to normal and I feel like I’ve mostly processed the situation in a healthy way. We all have things in our past, and the most important thing is we are happy and we love each other.  

I thought I would also use this as an opportunity to address some of the most common questions/comments.

—

WHY DOES SHE STILL HAVE THE PICTURES?

Honestly I think she probably forgot. We all have stuff on our phones going back years. I found some nudes of exes that I had forgotten about so I guess I’m as bad as her.

HOW DID YOU KNOW IT WAS HER EX?

Because I could see a gallery of thumbnails from the same set and some had his face in

WAS IT PHOTOSHOPPED OR A STRAP-ON?

No

YOU MUST BE EXAGGERATING NO DICK IS THAT BIG

2 coke cans is about right. It was bigger than her forearm.

As you can imagine, I’ve also received a bunch of dick pics in my DMs with guys comparing their dicks to 2 coke cans. Thanks for that chaps.  

A DICK THAT BIG COULDN’T GET HARD

It certainly seemed rock hard in the pictures, but she had previously mentioned that an ex had erection problems and relied on viagra. So maybe you’re right.

HER PUSSY MUST BE STRETCHED/CAVERNOUS/GAPING

She probably has the tightest vagina of all the girls I’ve been with. I guess you don’t know how vaginas work.

—

Someone told me that my original post was the most upvoted NSFW post in the history of Reddit. I don’t know if that’s true, but I guess that’s pretty cool.



TL;DR accidentally saw pictures of my girlfriend sucking the biggest sick in the world, processed the situation in a healthy way and everything is back to normal"
12,"TIFU by handing my USB to my roommate


**Gonna use a throwaway. I'm not giving my roommate the satisfaction of sharing this stupid shit of his on my actual account.** 

I had an essay to print out this weekend but since I no longer had my own printer, rest her poor soul, it meant driving down the print shop. So, I wasted no time copying all my shit to a USB and grabbing my coat. I was literally just about to shut the door behind me when I heard my roommate calling my damn name. He wanted something printed out as well. A fucking flyer or some shit. Random, but ok whatever. 

He asked if he could use my USB. I didn't see why not, so I said sure. Once he was done copying the file from his laptop, he gave me back my USB and said: ""Valar Morgulis, motherfucker"". I said: ""Valar dohearis, you degenerate turd"" and bounced. The print shop was busy when I got there but the wait was worth it because the girl who came to assist me was cute as fuck. Little did I know, this would only be the beginning of my humiliating downfall.

I handed the cute print shop girl my USB with the simple instruction of printing out the two files on there. As far as I knew, there was nothing else on the USB except those two documents. Print shop girl stared at her computer screen before locking eyes again. Her expression was unreadable. Like she was trying hard not to show an emotion. She leaned in and sheepishly asked: ""Which two files, sir?"". I replied: ""Only the two you see on there"". 

At that moment she turned the computer screen towards me and revealed that there was close to a dozen folders on there. Folders that never even existed when I copied my essay. Here's the damn punchline. All these fucking folders were labeled with hardcore, homo-erotic descriptions:

**""TINY TWINK DRILLED HARD BY HANDSOME HANDYMAN""**

**""COLLEGE STUD DRAINS HIS BIG UNCUT COCK""** 

**""CUTE BOY FUCKED IN THE ASS BY DADDY""**

**""TEASING MY DRUNK STRAIGHT FRIEND WITH RAW DICK""**

**""HIGH SCHOOL HUNKS FUCK BAREBACK""** 

**""HUNG DOCTOR GETS HEAD AFTER PHYSICAL""**

**""PLANET OF THE BOTTOMS: DAWN OF DA DICK""** 

There were loads more, but I'm sure ya'll get the pornographic picture. I shook my head in horror and said: ""That ain't mine"". Print shop girl's eyes narrowed and practically penetrated my fucking soul. 

""What should I print for you, sir?"" 

""It's my roommate... he does this kinda shit""

""Of course""

*Crickets*

I swallowed what remained of my dignity and did what had to be done. 

""Print the one called assignment, please. Under, uh... All Ass All Access. Thank you""

**Tl:dr I walked into my local print shop with an essay I had to print out. I walked out looking a gay porn addict.**"
13,"TIFU By Listening To My Dad and Beating My Bully's Ass *PROOF*


OK...I was awakened this morning by my dad saying, ""Hey Dude! You're famous!"" Last night he posted a story about me giving my bully a beatdown. We read through the comments together and I want to say that I am overwhelmed at the support I have recieved, not only for knocking my bully TFO but also for the two surgeries I went through. First of all, I wanted to give you guys some proof because I keep seeing post about this being fake. Here are some pics of me, before and after my surgeries and a shamless karma whoring pic of my dog and family. We are a big clan and we are very close.

Here is a link to the original post: [https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/bvu086/tifu\_by\_giving\_my\_son\_permission\_to\_beat\_his/](https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/bvu086/tifu_by_giving_my_son_permission_to_beat_his/)

Here are the pics of me:

&amp;#x200B;

To clarify, the kid who hit me in the chest was a good friend of mine. He did not intend to hurt me. We were just clowning around. The kid who bullied me would just slap me or punch me. I thought he would stop but he never did. I didn't want my brother to do anything about it because I was scared he would get hurt again. He had a Level 2 Traumatic Brain Injury from a mountain biking accident and everyone is very protective of him. To those of you who say I should have told on the kid. That is a terrible idea. That would just serve to put a bigger target on my back. Then it would have been twenty bullies hitting me every day. 

Also, I feel bad for the kid I hit. I feel like his home life isn't all that great. He is always looking for attention. I tried talking to him afterwards but he didn't want to. I did talk to his brother, though, and he was glad I punched him. 

As far as the surgey goes, I think I will do a AMA on that because I saw a lot of questions about it from people who have Pectus and are curious about the surgery. 

TL;DR: My dad posted about me beating up my bully and now I spent an entire sunny, Idaho day inside reading posts and laughing at my dad."
14,"TIFU by making my cousin agree to hooking up with me


 

This happened today morning and I am still thinking how to process it. This is gonna be a long rant.

I have another account that I use professionally so this is a throwaway.

Going for a stressful period in life and so I often hang out with my cousin and we too are really close in a sibling way. So, coming to today I live in 2 rooms on the first floor - an old room where everything from my previous flat is stocked and is more of a store room and the other is where I work and live 24x7. I woke up early to try clean my old store room and was rummaging through some old dvds and stuff.Also made double sure I had the condoms hidden away in a box and whilst doing so, a client who had been avoiding paying me called - I dropped everything and got into the call which ended with me throwing away my phone and the tempered glass cracks. No worries, I got another one- meanwhile cousin was laughing away hysterically at me. I was trying to get the new temper on and realized I need to wipe it, given how lazy I am I asked her to go get some wet wipes from the other room and told her which box had it. She went and disappeared for nearly half an hour. Given, how absent minded she can be I did not think anything of it and kept the phone aside for now.

Later, she comes to the room with a very serious look, somewhat teary eyes and asked me if I really wanted this ? I said ""Yes, I have been waiting forever for this"" and I mimicked her serious tone just for kicks. Next thing I know she has jumped on top of me and is kissing me - not the brotherly kiss btw and I sat there all frozen and for some reason I did not move a muscle to throw her off me. I just froze. she starts stripping and i said something like why/how...its a bit foggy there. She says see saw the strawberry condoms, the adele dvd and the old box had this Pretty please designed on it. strawberry is her favourite and adele is her weakness. So, my poor cousin struggled with the moral dilemma for a good 30 minutes before coming to me to ask me and I stupidly said yes. I put the condoms instead of the wet wipes (both have some bluish covers) That stupid adele album is here favourite.

Thankfully, before she could disrobe and this went any further, we heard my mother shouting from below that lunch is ready. I quickly made my exit without blinking for a second and had my lunch without choking myself. Mom dragged my cousin to the market for some shopping and my cousin told me with great sadness in her voice ""I am there for you""

I am writing this now knowing I might have messed up my relationship with her forever.

I know I will tell her the truth when she comes back but such a series of coincidences is too hard to be believed

TL;DR : Sent cousin to get wet wipes, had mixed up old stuff earlier, gave her all the signals that I wanted to hookup with her and she agreed. Kill me now someone pls."
15,"TIFU by sexually harassing a 9 year old boy


TIFU, and it actually happened today. I was driving with my 12 year old daughter. We got caught at a red light next to a restaurant. I glanced at the restaurant and saw a kid waking in the parking lot by himself. It looked like my daughter’s friend Gabe. I said to her, “is that...” and before I could even finish, she said yes. 

So I suggested we say hi to him. I rolled down my window and screamed “Gabe!” The kid turned around, and that’s when I realized it wasn’t Gabe. It was a younger boy, maybe 9 years old. 

So here’s the thing. This kid isn’t Gabe. God only knows if he’s even heard the name Gabe before. And it’s a busy intersection, so it’s noisy. 

The kid had such a puzzled and embarrassed look on his face, and he ran to his car. And that’s when I realized, this 9 year old kid thinks a middle aged woman just rolled down her car window, screamed “gay!!!” at him, and drove away. My daughter laughed her ass off at me. 

TL;DR: I called an elementary school kid gay while stopped at a red light."
16,"TIFU by writing official mails to people and not realising my profile picture is literally me grabbing a friend's butt


So a couple of weeks ago, I finally setup my apple-id. I also put up some random photo of myself. For whatever reason, I just picked the first image that popped up, which happened to be a shot of me grabbing one of the lads's bum. I had cropped said friend out of the picture to make it be of my face only, thinking nothing of it.

&amp;#x200B;

Since then, I've been applying to graduate schools and a few institutes (trying to break into sciences/research).

&amp;#x200B;

Only now has it come to my attention that apple displays this picture in mails, too. Now, I was like, eh not a big deal, right? FUCKING WRONG. Apparently, it displays the FULL IMAGE - NOT the cropped one, but the FULL thing! I've been sending out fucking official mails with this thing for a couple of weeks now. I've been trying to get in contact with important people and universities for weeks, all this time giving these people a nice handy view of me groping this guy. Fucking fantastic way to kick off professional relations, this.

Picture in question: [https://imgur.com/a/2jwEfUS](https://imgur.com/a/2jwEfUS) (friend's face blurred for obvious reasons)

tl;dr: Applied to graduate school and jobs via mail, giving off first impression of being friendly neighbourhood butt groper."
17,"TIFU going on a Xanax binge and giving an elderly mouse a Viking funeral


When I was in the second semester of my freshman year of college I was spending most of my time with a very rowdy kid from Siberia, and we were making a lot of bad decisions. One Friday afternoon he showed up unexpectedly at my dorm room, proudly holding a sandwich bag containing 12 Xanax bars. Being 18 and stupid, I was down to take them almost immediately, and we went back to his dorm to partake. We spent the rest of that day in a stupor, hanging out with his pet mouse, Yama, who was pushing 4 years old at that point and was visibly old and unwell. I remember putting him back in his cage, feeding him, and watching him make a sad, tired attempt to run on his wheel for a few minutes. 
At some point after that we blacked out, and we both passed out in his room some time in the late evening. Early the next day I woke up on my friend’s super small couch to him sitting about 3 inches away from my face, whispering, “hey, dude, I think Yama had a heart attack.” I got up and walked over to the cage, and found the poor old bastard at the foot of his wheel, 1000% dead. My friend cried in silence for a while, and I just kind of sat there watching, until suddenly he looked up at me and said, “we have to honor him.” I had a breakfast date that morning, and he was so barred out I honestly thought he may have still been blacked out when he said that, so I didn’t think much of it and left around 9:30. Two hours later I returned, because we had plans to get alcohol from some senior, only to find his room in shambles and him sitting on the ground, Xanax spread all over the floor, in the process of finishing an elaborate ship-like vessel made out of an iPhone case that he had stuffed with some of the bedding from Yama’s cage, inside of which he had placed Yama’s body, along with a cocktail sword and a small metal button Yama used to play with. He looked up at me and said in such a serious tone, “we’re giving him a Viking funeral.” Once again, being 18 and stupid, I was immediately down. It sounded cool, I wanted to honor Yama, and the timing seemed perfect, because we could get it done in half an hour and walk straight over to the bus stop across the street from where we planned on interring him. With the decision made and the materials ready, we both took more Xanax and set out on our mission.
We took Yama and his funeral boat, along with some flowers and a bottle of lighter fluid, to a little pond on campus that was just behind the building that he lived in at the time. I made a speech, he said some Russian prayers, and we put flowers on the ground near the pond for him- it was beautiful. After all of the ceremony was concluded, my friend poured lighter fluid over Yama and his boat, and we got ready to send our departed friend to Valhalla. I figured that we would be lighting the pyre once the boat had been placed in the water, but my friend had other ideas. He placed it on the ground and dropped a match on it while we were still 20 feet from the pond. At this point, things went sour fast. 
In his Xanax induced haze, he had somehow managed to not stuff the iPhone box entirely with Yama’s bedding. Instead, he only put in enough to fill the top half of it, leaving half of the box completely empty, which allowed most of the the lighter fluid to pool at bottom. About 5 seconds after he dropped that match, the box basically exploded and sent flaming cardboard and small pet bedding material about 6-10 feet in every direction. The fire from all of this debris set a decent sized patch of grass ablaze, and it seriously looked like we had genuinely fucked up and started a bad fire. My friend, being a dumbass, immediately responds by yelling “run,” but somehow in the heat of the moment I was able to stop him from leaving (usually he would’ve just bailed). He starts dumping a water bottle he had all over bits of the flaming debris, successfully putting out much of the fire, but failing to do anything to the large patch of flaming grass near where the remains of the box itself were burning. At this point real panic had set in, the fire was getting way too big, and to top it off, I could see the bus we had to take coming around the corner. In a moment of pure adrenaline, I took off the coat I was wearing and tossed it over the flames. This managed to smother the fire, I put the coat back on, and my friend and I both ran over to the bus stop and just managed to catch the bus we needed to take to get our alcohol.
The whole time I was in that bus, I was overwhelmed by this horrible, sickeningly sweet-ish meaty smell that I can only assume was roasted Yama. We spent most of the ride in silence, until about 10 minutes in, when my friend turned to me and said, “wow, that was pretty bad.” It was. The smell is still clinging to that coat 5 years later. My friend didn’t graduate with me. 
Tl;dr took a bunch of Xanax with a Russian, tried to give a mouse a Viking funeral, nearly burned down a college campus and ruined my coat in the process
Rest In Peace Yama."
18,"TIFU by probably causing a divorce.


Quick background: I work for the Wastewater department of a city on the east coast of the US.  The vast majority of my job right now is driving around on a ""stoppage truck"", which is a giant water tank slaved to a big diesel compressor that throws 3-5000 psi water down the lines that go from a building or house to the sewer main to clear blockages.  I've found everything in those lines: whole blue jeans, half of a ham, ammunition, watertight packages of what appeared to be cocaine...everything.

This TIFU is from a couple months back.  We get a call, like normal, so we go to the address, open up the nearby manhole, then open up the cleanout in the lateral pipe that leads from the building.   The homeowner's wife is there, just watching us do our work, making jokes, etc.  This is actually pretty common, because people can be fascinated by what a sewer looks like, and are often surprised that it doesn't look like something out of the Teenaged Mutant Ninja Turtles.

Well, we send pressure down the line, and I check to see if we get outflow at the manhole.  I see water...and then I see condoms.  So many condoms.  Easily 50 of the little bastards come blasting into the manhole, so I start laughing my ass off and kill the water.  I inform the lady that the line is cleared up and she should be fine, and she asks what caused it, so I show her the latex apocalypse down in the manhole.

This is where I knew I fucked up.  Her exact words were ""But we don't use...but...I...Mother...FUCKER!""

I didn't figure out why she was so mad until she pulled out the camera to take a picture of the mess.  Her and her husband didn't use rubbers.  I told her to have a nice day, reeled up the hose, closed the manhole and cleanout, and noped the absolute hell out of that neighborhood.

That house was up for sale when I saw it today.  My bad.  


TL;DR: I cleared a sewer line that cheating husband's rubbers clogged up, and showed it to her."
19,"TIFU by marrying my step sister


This is a throwaway friends know my account and we want to keep this private.

So 29 years ago my mother had a at home birth and out popped her only child, me. When filling out all work she refused to give any info on my father so according to the government I don't have a dad. Life growing up wasn't hard my mom was a doctor so financially we were stable my grandma would take care of me and it was overall nice however my mom refused to ever talk about my dad all I knew is he was ""a tall son of a bitch"".

5 years ago I met the girl of my dreams. Long black hair a lovely face and an amazing body. She was the sweetest thing and seemed to understand me. She was 19 I was 24 but age didn't effect us. We met at a coffee shop she worked at I would come around 7, when they were about to clothes get coffee and talk with her as she clothed shop. Soon enough I asked for her number she told me she wasn't aloud to give private info to customers so I waited till they closed walked out with her then asked her again. She agreed and we started talking more. Things went up from there we started dating I got close with her family she got close to mine and a year ago I proposed to her at the coffee shop we met at. To my joy she said yes. 

Wedding planning is a bitch I hated it it took about 4 months and during that time my mom got cancer and was put in a hospital. December 14 2018 we got married, skyped call the whole thing for my mom. And January 9th 2019 my wonderful mother passed away. 

My wonderful supporting now wife was amazing throughout this all, we held the funeral and she kept me going and we held the funeral. This is where life took a turn. We were cleaning out the attic of her house preparing everything to sell. No big deal. Thats when I found a photo album from when my mom was in collage. I flipped through it and noticed something, a guy commonly with my mom..... Was my wifes dad. Shocked and stunned I approached my wife with it and she said we should talk to her dad about it. We go to him and he tells us about how he dated a girl in collage got her pregnant couldn't handle it and ""dissapeared"" to a different part of town. We explain to him how thats my mother and thats where this story leaves off, I'm grossed but my wife and I talked about it. Were going to try and stay together and never talk about this again.

Tl;dr: I had no dad met a girl married her found out her dad was my dad"
20,"TIFU by stumbling across my mom’s affair...


(I started writing this when the whole situation first happened, but it started to get more and more complex, so I’ve been waiting to get as much info as possible, and it’s been about two months since the first incident.)So here’s some background information, my parents have been together 19 years. My dad’s the real provider for the family, he was in the military for 26 years, but retired after being hurt in a car accident. He still makes good money off his new job and Veteran’s Affairs checks. My mom spends a lot of his money on clothing and purses and other stuff, but it’s kind of okay because she’s a stay at home mom. The one thing I was always upset about her was that she traveled a lot, never taking any of my family with her. Me(16M), and my two little brothers(11) never have traveled anywhere with her. With that out of the way, here’s the story. I was just playing Red Dead Redemption 2, and my mom came down to watch me play because that’s her way of interacting with me. She kept asking questions about the story and stuff, and I’d tell her to listen to the characters and cutscenes but she wouldn’t listen because she was just texting on her phone. Eventually, I was annoyed and said, “Let’s see what’s keeping you busy.” I tried to grab the phone jokingly, but she got scared and pulled away, which got me interested. I left the room and five minutes later, I came back and took her phone right out of her hands while she wasn’t looking, she started screaming and chasing me around. I tried to read but I couldn’t read the texts, but I recognized the name(we’ll call her V, who’s a female). She was upset and left, and I figured something was up because if there was nothing to hide she wouldn’t have acted this way. So I knew something was wrong. I acted distant the next few days because I was worried about what was wrong and that she was hiding stuff from me. A couple days past, and she sat me down before school, and asked me what I saw on her phone. Now since I didn’t know any specifics, I didn’t want her to know that so I just said, “You tell me.”  That’s when she basically said, “You saw what I was talking to V about. How I like-like her.”  And guess what happened the next day. My dad told me he knew that I knew. WHICH MEANS HE KNOWS ABOUT THE AFFAIR!!!! He said  that he doesn’t like it, but he has a couple reasons for tolerating it. 1.He still loves her, 2.He doesn’t want to break the family up, and 3.She says she’s “exploring herself” so he feels like it would be unfair to give her an ultimatum. I was pissed. My dad is sacrificing so much, including his self respect and happiness, and my moms sleeping around with her best friend. 

Now about two months have passed, and my dad is still unhappy, my mom still doing this, and she’s barely at home anymore. She’s at V’s house 24/7 basically.(Another fun side note, V also has a husband and two kids, and her husband also knows and is also very sad and upset with this).

And the worst part is, my mom keeps making me and my dad hang out with V. She’ll make us have dinner with her and her family, and it’s so awkward and painful. I’m just really pissed off that my mom is just tearing apart my family and making us unhappy, just for her sake. 

For those of you that read this far, thank you for listening, and I hope you don’t fuck up like I did.
Moral of the story is don’t read other people’s phones...

TLDR:I read my mom’s phone, stumbled across her affair with her best friend, and my family’s falling apart, yay!"
21,"TIFU by throwing my runty and mentally challenged kitten in the trash


Maybe this is over dramatic, but I will forever feel horrible for this.

For some background, my kitten Bones is the runt of our latest litter, and is 8 weeks old. She’s really tiny, about half the size of her siblings. I say ‘mentally-challenged’ because she’s kind of stupid. By this I mean she walks into walls, off of edges, and into our other pets- and is completely stunned by this. She has to take a whole minute to figure out how to jump a short distance. At first we thought she was blind, but it turns out she’s just kind of slow I guess. When she wants attention or food she headbutts the wall. When she ‘runs’ she opens her mouth to breath and drools everywhere. She’s also somewhat cross-eyed, and also walks really weird, with her tail straight up, back legs bent like she’s crouching, and her ass half-way to the ground. We actually even named her Bones because when she walks, her hip bone juts out in a way that it’s very prominent. 
We took her to the vet last week, and he said she was perfectly healthy now besides breathing problems, but we should watch out for possible seizures in the future. He thinks she probably got dropped by her mom when she was a few days old, and that could be why she’s kind of weird.

So anyways, she’s my favorite little kitten out of the litter. Even though she’s quirky, she’s very loving and fun to play with. Her favorite thing to do is curl up against my neck and cuddle. 
Two days ago at 4 AM I had just finished binging GoT and went to go throw away the wrapper of a popsicle I’d eaten. She’s small enough to fit in my palm, so I got lazy and was carrying her and holding the popsicle wrapper in the same hand. This was a really stupid decision. 

I popped open the metal trash can and without even thinking, threw her and the wrapper in the trash. I didn’t even register it until I heard a loud thunk and strained ‘mrow’. It hit me and I rushed to turn the light on I could pull the top off and see inside. This happened to be the same night my mom decided to clear all the leftovers from the fridge into the trash can. So she was covered in a ton of old, sloppy food (most enchiladas and spaghetti). She also had somehow hit her face. She had a really bloody nose she kept sneezing from and I swear her hear had a little bump that looked dark under the fur.

I panicked and took her to the bathroom to wipe her down. The second she heard the water she scratched the hell out of my hand and pissed and shit all over herself. I felt horrible. I got a washcloth and wiped her down the best I could, but she wasn’t happy at all and her bloody nose kept going. 
It eventually stopped but I still felt like shit. She didn’t trust me for the rest of the night or the next day, and kept running away from me. She didn’t eat at all and only laid in the same place. I was so scared I had given her severe brain damage or something crazy. She warmed up to me again, but I will forever feel horrible.

Also the scratches she gave me got infected and pus-filled, so there’s that.

Tl;dr: Was too lazy to hold my runty and mentally challenged kitten and trash in different hands, so I accidentally threw her into a metal trash can so hard I gave her a horrible bloody nose and bump. Also got infected scratches from trying to help her."
22,"TIFU by following my sister’s secret instagram account showing off her insane booty in yoga pants.


This happened over the past week, not just today. I stumbled upon someone’s insta via one of the many subreddits on here dedicated to girls in yoga pants. Big booties squeezed into tight smooth spandex, y’know the drill. A few I’ve followed via my own discreet insta account (ie not my main personal one). I have a thing for girls in leggings and yoga pants, a particularly throbbing thing, I’ll admit that. One specific account I stumbled across I’ve since learned is very much too close to home. At first I thought nothing of it and did my thing, as one does. But then I recognised a few things. First was a door, and then an entranceway to a house, and then as I scrolled down I recognised a kitchen, and then a living room. In case you haven’t latched on, the rooms I recognised were the very same ones in my house, and it dawned on me that the absolute only owner of this insta account that I’d been not only following, but also flowing over, was that of my one and only dear sister. I’ve since unfollowed and tried to forget about it, but had to write it down here for therapeutic purposes. Needless to say I won’t be letting her in on what I stumbled across or what happened.

TL;DR: I accidentally stumbled across, followed, and thouroughly enjoyed my sister’s anonymous Insta account until I realised it was her’s."
23,"TIFU by offering a patient a blow job


NSFW 

Obligatory didn't happen today, happened last year. 

I work as a community nurse. I had a patient with a wound on his buttock, not far off from his rectum. We were using a vacuum dressing on it, obviously a very hard spot to get a good, air-tight seal. For this reason, we had to use different types of paste, tape, and the area needed to be very dry. To achieve this, we used a blow drier. 

I was chatting away with the patient and his wife while I worked away. The time came for me to dry the area, so I said, ""just going to give you a quick blow job"". 

Thankfully, they pretended not to hear it/ didn't acknowledge it. Cue my face going as red as possible and total embarrassment. 

Unfortunately, not the only time in my career that I've stuck my foot that far in my mouth.

TL;DR work as a nurse, was using a blow drier to dry area around dressing, said ""just going to give you a quick blow job"". Died inside."
