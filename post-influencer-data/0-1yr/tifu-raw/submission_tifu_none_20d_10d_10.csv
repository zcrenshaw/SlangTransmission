0,"TIFU by telling my son's new doctor we are Anti-Vaxx


Obligatory this happened several months ago, tl;dr at bottom.

My son has autism (level 1, previously called aspergers) and due to that he also has a psychiatrist, multiple psychologists and doctors. We decided to get a new primary doctor who works closely with his other providers to better coordinate his care this past summer. I brought my son in for a standard ""well child"" visit, and spent nearly an hour with this new doctor going over his issues, and medications, history etc.

Toward the end of the visit she says to me, ""Well, he can get the gardasil vaccine today,"" to which I reply, ""Oh, no we he can't have that, I don't want him to get autism.""

I should maybe note here that I am an aspie too, and while I think my sarcasm is on point, I must have been a little too serious looking because she just stared at me. The silence lasted an eternity while I imagine she was deciding how to proceed. Eventually I laughed and tried to assure her I was only kidding, but she only returned a nervous sounding chuckle and left the room.

As my son and I were discussing whether I was offensive (he thought I was hilarious) in walked the nurse with a stack of information about vaccines. He started his lecture about vaccine safety and potential risks, etc. and no amount of my assurances that we are not in fact anti-vax would stop him. He just kept saying, ""Okay, well I have to tell you this,"" in a way that suggested that the doctor told him to give me the full spiel. 

Tl;dr: Jokingly told my son's new doctor that I didn't want him to get *more* autism, got a 15 minute lecture on vaccine safety for my already fully vaccinated kid."
1,"TIFU by trying to gift my bf some sweet undies and subsequently spoiling his surprise proposal plans


 About three weeks ago, I began preparations to get a nice gift for my bf, who I'll call ""Ray,"" to celebrate 4 years of dating.

We live in a terribly humid place, and all summer he's been complaining about how sweaty his ass and balls get whenever he goes outside. He's been buying the same brand of cotton boxer-briefs since we started dating. I thought it would be a nice homage to our great relationship, a great way to take care of the butt I get to squeeze on the regular, to splurge on a mail subscription service to some silky micromodal underwear. They are pricey but known for being wicking, cooling, and overall very nice on the buns and balls.

I ordered the first pair to present to him on the day of, and set up for a pair to be delivered monthly thereafter. I used his email on the sign-up so that I could simply pass on the account to him after the first pair came; that way, he'd have full power to pick his colors and style every month, and easily return any if there were unexpected problems.

One small problem: the receipt for this whole transaction is now resting in his email where he can find it and spoil my surprise. I sneakily hacked into his computer while he was out (by which I mean I entered the password he's shared with me, because he foolishly trusted me not to wreck his shit) and opened up his email. I simply archived the existing emails and set it up so that future emails from the company would be auto-marked as read and archived as well. I know how to do this because I'm a brilliant hacker (I googled it).

While carefully double checking my devious work- just to ensure nothing slipped through the cracks- a new email pinged on arrival and caught my attention: A SHIPPING CONFIRMATION FOR AN ENGAGEMENT RING. I immediately noped off his computer, and of course I didn't open the email, but the damage is done. Secret's out!

My heart fell right through my butt, you guys. I actually died and now I'm a ghost writing this.

I probably should have pretended I never saw that, and taken the secret to my grave, but I was too pumped and couldn't keep it in. Within the hour I broke down and called Ray to sheepishly confess what I had done. He wasn't angry, but sadly disappointed that I spoiled the surprise. 

Here's the kicker: he didn't actually propose yet, and still intends to make a thing out of it.

My punishment for snooping is that the suspense is KILLING ME. I've been forbidden from telling anyone that we're getting engaged until it's officiated. Every time we go out, the suspense that this may be the night drives me crazy!

A romantic date at the beach the other evening ended with me saying ""damn, I thought for sure we were getting engaged tonight.""

""Why would you think that I'm going to propose to you?"" He said. ""That sounds like something you wouldn't know about because I'd keep it secret IN MY PERSONAL EMAIL!""

Now he's started intermittent faking me out. The other day, he walked into the kitchen and presented me with a little hinged box, which turned out to be a tie pin from his work. He keeps getting down on one knee... Looking up at me... And saying, ""Gotta tie this shoe!"" The emotional stress of keeping this exciting secret within me, not sharing it with coworkers or family or anyone, is MADDENING. Every false start sends my heart right back into my butt.

One more thing: I somehow fucked up the email settings. The shipping confirmation for the underwear didn't get archived on arrival, and he saw it within a few hours. So that surprise got spoiled, too. Turns out I'm not a master hacker, and my attempts have only brought woe into this house.

I guess it's not all bad: he reports that the pair of boxer-briefs that arrived are very nice to wear, and I do indeed enjoy squeezing his buns in them.

If we ever do actually get married it'll be nice to be hitched to a guy with sweet, silky buns and balls.

TL ; DR: tried to hide an email receipt for some fancy underoos, found out about an incoming engagement ring, now I'll never get a husband"
2,"TIFU By realizing that my ceiling fan has been making my bedroom a sauna for 11 years


I’ve been living in this house for the past 11 years. In my bedroom there’s a ceiling fan that I always have on to try and make my room colder. My room has always been insanely hot compared to the rest of the house and I never understood why.

Flash forward to today when I’m talking to a friend that said they found out their fan can switch directions to heat the room in the winter. I immediately realized my fuck up. When I got home I took a closer look at the fan and hiding by the light is a little black switch. I hit the switch and what do you know, my room is about 10 degrees colder in minutes. I’ve been sleeping in a sauna for the past 11 years and had no idea. Every day in the summer waking up sweaty was because of a tiny black switch.

TLDR: My ceiling fan has been spinning the wrong direction and heating my room for 11 sweaty years"
3,"TIFU a marriage


 Obligatory this didn't happen today, but a couple of weeks ago.

 So I sometimes drive for ride share companies to make extra cash and keep me off of the couch. I live in a touristy area that booms during summer months and vacation rental homes are common... So common that I sometimes do pick-ups and drop-offs at the same homes for different people week to week and family/friend groups of people renting the homes are the norm.

 One particular day I dropped a guy off at a beautiful home near the beach, that I had picked a guy up from just an hour or two prior. So as we arrive I mention this to the rider:

Me - Hey I just picked one of your buddys up from here about an hour ago

Rider- No, must be the wrong house

Me- Nope, he walked right out of that side door. I dropped him off at *names local bar* His girlfriend is still in there though, she stayed behind. (I had seen her kiss him goodbye at the door, but didn't mention this to the rider) You guys having a family/friend vacation?

Rider- This is a family owned home, it's been in my family for years and we don't rent it out. Nobody lives here but me and my wife and I've been in NY for work for the past 4 days. 

Awkward silence as we both come to the realization. 

He got out and I drove away scolding myself for having such a big mouth. 

TLDR- I may have ruined a marriage by trying to make small talk with my big mouth"
4,"TIFU As a Reaction to Butt Worms (almost certainly NSFW)


This is the reason people create throw-aways, but screw it, it happened. 

Also: this occurred a little over a decade ago, which will eventually be pertinent.

For background: At some point in my childhood, I developed pin-worms. In the interest of science, I must admit that I don't know for certain that I had pin-worms, just that my mother (who was 17 when she had me in the 70's and loved home remedies) had seen me scratching my bottom, for good or bad reasons concluded that I had pin-worms, and instructed me to shove a clove of garlic into my anus in order to stop the little beasties.

I'm afraid that I don't know if the garlic helped, or if there was any other remedy, all I remember is that as a young child I walked around for the better part of day with a piece of garlic shoved up my bum, and I don't remember spending most of my childhood with an itchy asshole.

Fast forward a decade and a half: I am living on my own. Single. Re-Acclimating to the dating scene after an awkward breakup with an ex that everyone I am still close to refers to as ""She-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named"". I don't remember the exact moment of realization, but there was a gradual dawning....I had worms. My butt was beyond-normally itchy. Sometimes it didn't phase me, but there was a reoccurring itch that couldn't be sent away once it arrived. The confirmation came when I showered and cleaned my bottom, to discover on my finger a half dozen tiny, white, croissant-shaped worms who had apparently been residing on the outside of my butthole.

I hoped they would go away. I showered multiple times a day, scouring my ass with cleanser as best as possible, even venturing the occasional soap-covered-finger up my bum to clean out the system. But every morning, I would wake up, take a shower, and discovered more tiny beasties.

I was horrified, but I made an appointment at my local clinic. When I told the nurse over the phone that I thought I had butt-worms, she was \*extremely\* skeptical. She said it was ""highly unlikely"", but they would do tests.

I went in, embarrassed as a naked nun in Sunday school, and the doctor, a friendly South-East Indian man, reiterated the nurse's skepticism, could not find anything immediately amiss when he peered up my bum, but asked me to send in a sample of the worms when they appeared and they would test.

I was already frustrated, but I waited until the next morning, gathered up a collection of the white aliens by pressing a row of scotch-tape against my asshole, confirming the beasties were present,and depositing them into a plastic container. Later I drove the sample to the office, but told it would be 1-3 weeks before I would get results.

In the meantime, I remembered the old remedy, bought a garlic bulb from our local health food store, and shoved a clove up my bottom. 

I would like to say that as a liberal American male, I wouldn't have an issue, but after about 4-5 hours going about my day, talking to coffee stewards, waiters, and business associates and pretending that I did not have a foreign object shoved up my rectum, I dashed to a restroom and removed the clove, horribly embarrassed, despite no one knowing what I had done.

Now to add: I had recently started seeing a wonderful woman. We had completely hit it off: she was a vibrant redhead, curvy, brilliant, and fun; I wanted nothing but to put my best foot forward. a week after depositing the sample to the clinic and no response, she and I found ourselves showering. My hand drifted down to my butt-crack and I realized I \*NEEDED\* to share my story with her, despite fears that I would mark myself as tainted and never be talked to again. So I spurted it out: ""Uhm, so yeah, I...uh...think I have butt worms....""

She was so practical about it. She asked to see. I pulled apart my cheeks, swiped my fingers between them, and pulled up a few white croissant specks for her to investigate.

""See,"" I said, embarrassed. ""Worms.""

...

""That's toilet paper"", she replied.

""W...what?""

""Yeah,"" she said, nonchalantly"". ""That's toilet paper.""

Everything fell into place. About a month ago, when finances got tight, I swapped my normal TP roll with Dollar Store discount brand, which was apparently breaking apart after I wiped, creating croissant shaped rolls on my bottom that caused itching.

My relief was intense, mixed with colossal embarrassment . My shower companion was nothing but amused and gracious.

TLDR: I spent the better part of a day with garlic shoved up my bum because I bought cheap toilet paper.

Postscript: Shower companion and I just celebrated our 8th year wedding anniversary."
5,"TIFU by kicking my son!


This happened a few weeks ago.

My ~6 year old son came running in to my home office the other day and said, demandingly, ""Dad! Kick me!""

So I did.

Hear me out, please. The kick was a 3/10 on firmness. Not gentle, but not painful. He's a kid, he likes to play fight, and as he's an only child, I feel like I need to provide a bit of rough and tumble so that he can learn boundaries. I also want him to ""lose some battles"", and to learn to ""roll with the punches"". 

Anyway... I performed a front kick whilst making the Bruce Lee Noise. I trust that you know the one. 

My son recoiled. He looked shocked, sad and disappointed, all rolled into one. He didn't cry,, but it was close.

He blurted out ""I said KISS Me!!!""

Oops!



TLDR; I misheard my son, which resulted in me kicking him."
6,"TIFU by not removing my girlfriends phone from my bed.


Obligatory this didn’t happen today, but actually close to a year ago. Last October to be exact. 

So backstory. I had been dating this girl at the time for about 4 months. Her parents were awesome and loving towards me, helping me with car repairs (her dad is great with cars) and her mom just being a very lovingly mother figure. They just didn’t want one thing: us having sex before marriage. They had a lot of reasons. And we were actually planning on it. But we both weren’t virgins, and her parents had no idea she had already lost her virginity. So of course, temptation got the better of us. Okay, end of backstory. 

She was a senior in high school and I had just started college about an hour away. We rarely got to see eachother, but when we did, we made it count. We would have fun date nights, cook or go out, and then go back to my place and do the deed. Everytime she would leave I would get sad, but knew I’d see her again. 

One time when she came up, she told me she needed to let her mom know she made it safely, and tried calling her. No answer. She said she was gonna text her. Made sense to me. Once she said we had, we got right to business. She put her phone on the bed, and I didn’t even 

Things went on for awhile. Lots of foreplay and we tried some new positions. Lots of fun. And by the end of it, we both laid down and it was dead silent. Followed by some vibrating. It was her phone ringing, but we couldn’t find it. Then we found it under my ass. We laughed about it for a sec, before she answered. It was her mom. And within seconds, my girlfriend’s expression went from one of laughter, to pure shock and horror. 

Turns out that she hadn’t clicked send on the text she sent out. So her mom has called us during our deed to make sure she was safe, and our best guess is her phone was underneath, and my ass managed to answer the phone. And in turn, she heard some unbearable noises, followed by my girlfriend calling someone “daddy” who was definitely not her dad (the mother’s words, not mine).  

She told my girlfriend to get her ass home now. 
My girlfriend started bawling and started having a panic attack. I attempted to calm her down but she wouldn’t. So I drove her back in her car, all while trying to calm her down and make myself remain calm. Her mother called again and started screaming at her, saying “how could she do this” and other things along those lines. My girlfriend said that we were on our way to talk. Her mother absolutely said I was not allowed over. 

So we got back to our hometown, I parked very close to her house, but far enough where we wouldn’t get caught. She drove home. I called my mom for a surprise “I’m home for the weekend”. She came and picked me up, and I bawled in her arms. I told her everything. She comforted me and told me she loved me and would do everything she could to help. 

We got back to my house, and I laid in my bed, anxious and nervous. I cried and just waited, hoping to hear from my girlfriend. For the longest time, I thought I never would hear from her again. Then finally, my phone rang, after 4 hours. She said she was coming over and we needed to talk. Once she got to my house, we talked for about 30 minutes. She said her parents were calm now, and then I was gonna be able to come talk. I was nervous, but I loved her so I did it. 

When I got to their house, I walked in and instantly just started apologizing. I went on and on about how “we won’t do it again” and how “we’re just stupid teenagers” and most importantly how I was gonna “rebuild their trust”. Eventually they told me things along the lines of everything was okay, they understood, and they just wanted us to be safe. We opened up a lot about my girlfriends past relationship, and how that guy had sexually assaulted her, and they just wanted to protect their daughter.

At the end of it all, I learned they just loved their daughter and didn’t want her getting hurt. But they trusted me. And we are still together, now at 1 year and 2 months in. And everything is cool. Sometimes I worry it’s still weird with her parents, but they still show me the same love and support. 

TLDR: My girlfriend and I took phone sex to a whole other level."
7,"TIFU by being oblivious to the notes my fiancée has been writing me.


Obligatory “It’s 7 AM. This didn’t happen today, but very recently.” I have been packing a lunch for work for about the past two months. I pack it usually, but if I’m behind schedule, my fiancée will sometimes help or do it for me.

I got home from work, and we were talking about how the day went. She asked me how lunch was, and I told her it was good and thanked her again. After a pause, she kinda laughed and said “Did you like the note today?!”

Puzzled, I told her I didn’t know what she was talking about. She said “The note. The one I put it your lunch today.” I told her I didn’t see a note. But the way she said “today” made it feel like this wasn’t the first time. I said “Wait. Have you written me a note before?”

She said “Yes. Have you never seen them?” So apparently this is the 9th note she has written on a napkin, and I’ve thrown every one in the trashcan at work.

TLDR: my fiancée was being sweet as per usual, and I was literally throwing it in the garbage can."
8,"TIFU by leaving my ear tubes in for 13 years and not realizing my hearing was going to be different when I took them out


Happened this week and I just read another user's post about breathing through one nostril and I felt inspired to share my own story.

Context: I've had tubes in my ears my whole life, 24 of my 25 years. My childhood is filled with eat eat infections, vaccuums, drops, 6 nurses holding me down as I fought them off, and surgery. I've had 5 to 8 sets of tubes in my ears. My mom and I honestly lost count because there were just too many. My last tube set was put in when I was in 5th grade I believe. I was around 10 or 11. 

I've lived my entire life with them and they've never caused problems. In fact they've helped a few times! I feel absolutely no pressure in my ears on airplanes because the tubes equalize pressure slowing me to be fine. It's awesome. 

So here's where the issues started. 4 months ago I started waking up to watery ears, which for me is a really bad sign. I ignored it because at this point in my life ENT doctors give me a lot of anxiety. But the symptoms started getting worse so last month I bit the bullet and went in. I saw the same doctor I had seen and a child. I couldn't believe he was still alive! He told me I developed a polyp on my tube and it's been in there so long he wants to remove it. I knew this day would come so I agreed.

My surgery was last Thursday and immediately post OP I realized things were off. My ear popped more times than I could count and I realize I feel air pressure now - no more carefree plane rides. My hearing was incredibly sensitive as well. Usually I blast my damn music in my car but now I drive around at 6 volume. And finally my voice has changed. The way I sound to myself it's completely different to what I've come to know over the course of my life. I can't really tell if I'm whispering or shouting just yet because I've never heard this voice before and it's going to take some getting used to. The kicker is that the doctor only removed my right tube, so now my hearing feels...uneven. I guess having something in my ear canal for 24 years effected my hearing -  who would have guessed?! I genuinely did not. 

PARENTS: please remove your child's ear tubes before they reach adulthood. 

TLDR: I've lived my entire life with tubes in my ears and they were effecting my life in more ways than I realized."
9,"TIFU by catcalling my husband.


Naturally, this did not happen today...
Tl;dr is at the bottom.

About a week ago, I was running errands with my 1 and 3 year old boys. We had some time to kill, and my 3 year old said that he wanted to see his daddy. So we picked up lunch and took it to my husband's work so that he could have a hot lunch instead of leftovers from the night before.

We got the boys out of their carseats, let them sit in our laps as we all ate chicken tenders and fries in the front seat. Then, my husband took us for a tour around his shop (he works in sheet metal and makes air ducts). Our kids loved it!

As we were leaving, I saw my husband walking into the building and honked at him, calling out ""hey, nice butt babe!""

Then it happened, my 3 year old yelled ""nice butt daddy!"" Which quickly turned into ""nice butt mama.""

I tried my best to ignore it even though he kept repeating it. I thought that the worst was over when he eventually forgot about it.

I was wrong.

Now, almost a week later, he is yelling out our living room window;
""Nice butt papa"" (what he calls out elderly neighbor)
""Nice butt mama""
""Nice butt baby"" (his little brother)

I don't think we will be leaving the house today...

TL;DR I set a bad example for my child and now he is telling everyone that they have a nice butt."
10,"TIFU by bodyslamming a girl who wanted to hug me.


I was in a new high school with absolutely no friends whatsoever and because I was very socially awkward I tried to avoid any direct confrontations with any individual whatsoever so I never really made any friends.

However in my fourth block there was this girl who I just seemed to have clicked with because out of all the students in the entire building she was the only one I really actually talked to. Skip a couple of weeks I’m coming into my class when she decides to greet me with a friendly hug. 

In this moment I was completely frozen because I never really physically interact with anyone, especially females. So in this moment, I go full brain dead and as she’s approaching me with open arms I decided I was going to try and be funny and pick her up from her waist and throw her over my shoulder (don’t ask why I thought this would be funny, because I honestly have no clue what the fuck I was thinking) but the second she sees me go down and try and pick her up I could just see the complete and udder confusion in her face as she was just simply wanting a quick hug, but as I pick her up just to make things ten times worse, I shout,

“WWE Supah Slammmm!!” 

And she’s screaming and for some reason my heart just dropped realizing what I was doing and instead of lightly setting her down, I just fucking drop her and she slams right into a cluster of desks making this massive crashing sound in the middle of the room. I went to ask her if she was okay but she started crying her eyes out basically asking me what the fuck was wrong with me.

TL;DR I shouldn’t be allowed around people."
11,"TIFU by breathing with one nostril my whole life.


So let me give some context on how this happened, a while ago i tried out an e-cig my friend has and he made fun of how smoke only goes out of one of my nostrils,i didn’t think much of it , i thought its just a stuffed nose.

So i try to clean my nose and its already not stuffed but yet again i didn’t put much thought into it.
Yesterday i noticed that my right nostril is blocked again and my nose isn’t stuffed, so i go look in the mirror to see that my right nostril is completely blocked by my septum.

I took a doctor appointment the next morning and as soon as he looked in he said i have septum deviation caused by breaking my nose at some point in my life when i was a kid and that it needed surgery.
I cant believe i’ve went for god knows how many years without realizing i wasn’t breathing correctly and thinking that this was the norm.
Surgery is within 24hours so yeah, this escalated quickly.

TL;DR. i’m stupid and didn’t realize my right nostril was blocked off by my septum for years."
12,"TIFU By Losing a Butt Plug [NSFW]


This happened about 20 min ago.

So last night my girlfriend and I decided to go out to the bars. Got very drunk and stumbled back to my place and starting doing the deed. Recently, we decided to be adventurous and invested in some butt plugs for her. Well last night was the first time we decided to use them. We read online that using lube makes putting the plugs in easier, so that we did. Everything went well but afterwards we couldn’t find the plug. This is where the TIFU begins. 

We figured the butt plug must have just fallen out or something so we went to sleep and we would find it in the morning. Woke up hungover and went to get food, entirely forgetting about the plug. GFs stomach has been hurting so we just figured she’s a little extra hungover no big deal. We arrive at McDs to get some greasy hangover food. I order while GF heads to the bathroom to hopefully resolve her stomach issue. As i take our order back to our table, GF walks over in a panic saying we need to leave NOW.

She found the butt plug. In our drunken state, we managed to put the ENTIRE thing in her ass. Handle and all. And now it’s sitting at the bottom of a McDonalds toilet in all its glory. 

Tl;dr: Did not use a butt plug as directed."
13,"TIFU by teaching my children not to fight, but to work together


Almost two years ago now.

Two kids, boys, 5 and 4. Fight like cats and dogs. Anything to annoy the other and start a fight. Grab a random object and throw it at the other when Dad isn't looking kind of thing.

One day I'm cleaning up the kitchen and the ruckus is extreme. I interject and sit them both down for a long talk about how much better things can be if they cooperate instead. At the end of it, I went back into the kitchen and resumed cleaning. A remarkable length of *quiet* while later, the 4yo comes to me.

4yo: Dad, Dad, come see what I made! \*grabbing my hand\*

Me: Sure, lets see.

He leads me to their room to the corner table where they have art supplies. And points to the papers on the table. He likes to draw and I encourage it when I can. What I see on the table however, are just random scribbles...

Me: Is this what you wanted to show me? \*I pick up the paper and check both sides, just a few random scribbles\*

Me: That's... great buddy, but why don't you come get me when it's finished? \*I put the paper down and turn to walk\*

4yo: No, NO! Dad, *LOOK!* \*pointing at the papers\*

Okay, maybe I missed one? I look through them again, no, just scribbles? I'm still looking at them when suddenly..

4yo grabs the papers from my hand and tosses them back on the table.

4yo: OK Dad, I'll show you later, you can go. \*pushing me towards the door\*

I'm a little confused, he's not like this usually. I pause outside their room, and when I do, I hear the crinkle of cellophane. 

My boys room is off the hallway leading to the stairs down the the basement. The stairs to the basement, are crinkling. 

I poke my head around the corner of the staircase and there is 5yo. With a package of Oreos clutched to his chest. He looks at me with big eyes and I just hold out one hand and point with the other. I took the package and he walked by right as I couldn't hold my Dad face any longer. 

See, the Oreos were on top of the refrigerator. So what has happened is 4yo baited me, while 5yo got a chair from the dining room, carried it to the kitchen to retrieve the loot then put the chair back and hid. This has to have been meticulously plotted. I'm a mix of horrified and proud.

I had to quickly put Dad face back on to tell them to not sneak treats and to now clean their room. Then I left the room and had a brief ""What have I done?"" moment back in the living room.

TL;DR My kids went from the Animaniacs to Pinky and the Brain."
14,"TIFU by making my GF watch walruses die.


Yeah, TIFU (last night) royally.  I was watching the making of  ""Our Planet"" last night and got about 50 mins into it and paused to let my GF in my apartment.  If you haven't seen it, I highly recommend it!  Incredible behind the scene documentation of how the videographers set up shots, traveled to exotic locations, survived in insane climates...ending with an unannounced scene of walruses falling to their deaths from a fucking **80 meter cliff**.  

My girlfriend comes in, we start cuddling on the couch, resume the doc, and then really sad music starts playing out of nowhere...  I have never seen this documentary before and everything else leading up to it was wholesome af, so this was a little alarming.  Before you know it, these god damn walruses are tumbling down giant cliffs because WHO THE FUCK KNOWS.  Even the camera crew was like ""WHY ARE THEY CLIMBING SO HIGH?!""  For god's sake, the footage was in super slow motion and we can clearly see these poor animals' skulls and tusks cracking with every tumble with their bodies curling over one another into a dead walrus stock pile.  It was truly awful and heartbreaking to watch.

My GF immediately separates herself from me, tears silently streaming down her face and says ""I'm going to bed""; It all happened so fast.  She was upstairs crying and I'm staring at a screen filled with dead fucking walruses while camermen and biologists continue crying on screen.  Guilt welled up in me because it was my idea to continue watching when she arrived.  It didn't help that she made it clear she is extremely sensitive to any sort of animal death early on in our relationship.

I went upstairs and cuddled up next to her while apologizing.  She understood and wasn't mad at me, although I still felt like a jerk.  Before you know it, we were back to laughing and making jokes after a few minutes, so all was well.  We made a deal to NEVER watch any wild life documentaries together ever again (bless you, Sir David Attenborough).  Funny enough, we made plans to go to the zoo on Saturday earlier in the week.  Avoiding the walrus exhibit at all costs.  

&amp;#x200B;

***TL;DR***  I accidentally made my girlfriend cry by watching walruses fall from an 80 meter cliff.  We are going to a zoo on Saturday and are avoiding the walrus exhibit.  Sir David Attenborough is a universal treasure.

By sitting through an entire date thinking it's a job interview

So this happened in the past 24hrs. 
I'm a 19 year old male making my way through college, and also work at a restaurant to make ends meet. Now you could consider me pretty smart except when it comes to social interactions, I can almost never pick up on little hints such as flirting. 

So yesterday was a pretty slow day at the restaurant and this middle aged lady (35-40) came in, she was the only customer we'd had all day, and as such I decided I'd be extra friendly and have a real conversation with her.

It's worth noting that she's very very attractive for her age, and she was very well kept as well.
During the conversation she mentions that she runs a property management/realtor business, and that she had just spent the day interviewing people for an assistant position she had open. But she hadn't found anyone worth hiring yet, then proceeds to ask me if I knew anyone looking for a job. 

Now I'm happy with my job, the money is decent (could be better ofc) but I'd always wanted a desk job. So I told her I was actually thinking of looking for another job. She then proceeds to say that ""I look like the perfect young man for the job"" and that she would like to talk about it more when I wasn't at work. So we made plans to meet the next morning for coffee. 

Now here's where my idiocy really becomes clear. 

Im not usually a morning person and the idea of an early morning interview had me nervous, so I made sure I woke up nice and early and got dressed looking real spiffy if I may say so.

I show up to the cafe dressed formally with my resume in hand. And as soon as she spots me she greets me with a long deep hug. This is when I should've realized this wasn't a standard job interview. But clueless as I am I just figured oh shes friendly. 

We sat down and the conversation never once broached the subject of my skills, qualifications, or employment history. Instead she mainly steered the conversation towards personal stuff like what are my hobbies, shared stories about her life etc... 

This whole time I'm thinking, oh she already knows where I work, and she's probably just looking for someone whose personality matches her's. Because of course no one wants an assistant who doesn't get them. DUH. 

Now by the time we were wrapping up, 2 hours had past, and the whole time I'm thinking oh this interview is going really well. Then as we stood up to leave the cafe, she gave me one more hug, and said she ""really did enjoy our date"" and asked if I'd be interested in coming over tonight for dinner. 

I froze for a second, DID SHE JUST SAY DATE?!?

Panicking as if the job was still on the line I quickly said ""sure that sounds great boss"" with two thumbs up and a dumb smile on my face.

I have no idea what I'm going to do...

TL;DR I went on and sat through an entire date thinking it was a job interview"

I live with four roommates in college and we often throw big parties. Tonight they had a ton of people over from their high school some of which I knew, some of which I didn’t. I decided to chat for a few minutes, then turn in early for bed. 

I was talking to this one girl (Amanda)(NOT her real name) who I’d met a few times before through my roommates. Always thought she was cute, and especially tonight. We chatted for about an hour, and we really got along, I thought about asking her out. 

Before I worked up the courage her friends arrived and she dipped to chat with them. I decided that’d be my cue to call it a night, and I went upstairs to bed. 

And, like many men out there on the internet, I often partake in a particular activity before sleeping, especially if I’ve been drinking, which I was. And I pulled up this girls IG for... inspiration. (Call me a peeve, I don’t care. I’m sure I’m about to be called everything by my friends)). she had a video showing herself jumping into a pool in a bikini. Her friend counted down and then she jumped off the diving board. I watched it four or five times with the sound on low, and then switched over to a porn app that plays video. 

*but here’s the thing.* as we were chatting, Amanda borrowed my phone to connect to the houses Bluetooth stereo and play one of her favorite songs. (I told you, our conversation had been going well.) And after that song was over I just put on a Spotify playlist and didn’t think anything more of it. 

Except these videos were playing through the stereo now. So Amanda’s bikini video played 4 or 5 times, immediately followed by some pretty hardcore porn. I realized it after about 10 seconds into the second video, but everybody heard and stopped talking downstairs. And then about 10 seconds after that the conversation slowly picked up again.

So now I can just hope Amanda doesn’t recognize her own Instagram video by audio. And that still doesn’t really help me from the whole porn side of it. 

TLDR F’s in that chat boys I’m going down"

So I'm up here in New Hampshire on a project for work.  I get a daily per diem for food.  I usually spend my first day food per diem on grocery store items; just stock the room up with some food for the rest of the week and crash.  The remaining day's allowances get spent going out to eat.  I did buy a little food in the airport that day, but planned to spend the rest in the grocery store.

So the fuck up.  I just got a hankering for good ham sandwiches.  Totally random, right?  But ham sandwiches can be the shit sometimes.  I grabbed some cherry coke zero for the fridge and some beef jerky for a snack.  The beef jerky is like 10 bucks and I only have about $20 remaining for the day.  Eh, work is paying for it, so who cares and sandwiches are cheap.  Surely I can do ham sandwiches on 10 dollars, right?  Wally world bread is only a buck.  I did get some of those zesty/spicy bread and butter pickles because those are also the shit.  Cheap store brand French's mustard.  I'm sure I can do this.  I hit the check out counter and my total is $19.76.  Fuck yea, self!  You did awesome.

Now it's almost midnight and I need to hit the hotel before they think I'm not going to show up or something.  I don't know if they actually cancel you for showing up after midnight, but I headed out, got checked into my room, start putting all my shit away.  Pickles in the fridge, bread on top of the fridge, mustard in the fridge, cokes in the fridge, and... fuck.  wtf?  I've got all the stuff for ham sandwiches except for ham.  How the hell did I forget ham?  I've ruined everything.  meh


TL;DR  Forgot to buy ham for my ham sandwiches.  Sorry that was a boring story that didn't end with my dick in the bread or a sandwich stuffed up someone's ass"
18,"TIFU by having a sex accident and taking the girl with me to hospital


This just happened... I'm still shook.

Had a date with a girl, take her home, have sex. All fun and games until i realise my foreskin won't go back up.

I've never experienced this before so i freak out. I call everyone asking for advice.

I get the girl I'm with to call an ambulance. We go to hospital together.

I'm lying on the wheeler and there are 6 people all looking at me in my lowest moment.

Doctor says he has to squeeze my dick to stop the swelling in my mushroom tip. I freak out like fuck. He says he may need to circumcise me... i freak out beyond belief. 

The girl is with me comforting me the whole time.

I experience next level pain as the doc squeezes my dick. First time no luck, 2nd time no luck... I'm in agony and the painkillers aren't doing shit.

3rd time he goes and voilá, back to normal. 

I thank the doctor and apologise for screaming, he says its ok.

Leave the hospital, thank god that I still have my most precious possession and go home.

The girl still wants to see me... despite her seeing me at my worst, she still likes me... i think i love her

Tl:dr - foreskin doesn't go back up after sex... go to emergency room where doc squeezes my dick... my girl is next to me watching the whole thing but still wants to see me again."
19,"TIFU by saying the dumbest thing I've ever said to one of my students


Background: I'm a high school physics and engineering teacher. This happened 8 hours ago.

Today, with my computer tucked under my arm, I'm asked by a student to sign off a project he was working on (which, formally, requires my signature to make it official). I grabbed my pen and realized that I couldn't sign without dropping my computer. So, I said, ""hey can you hold down that paper? I don't have a hand.""

It was at the point that my stomach dropped of a cliff. Because the student I asked to help me LITERALLY DOESN'T HAVE A HAND. He literally has a nub on the end of his left arm. No palm, no fingers. No hand. And what do I say? I say, in essence, ""hey no-hand person, when I say I don't have a hand really I do but I'm just holding something with it which you can never do but I can do and I'm saying I don't have one. But I do. And you don't."" The dude even uses his non-hand arm to pin down the paper while I sign as if to say ""This is what not having a hand is. Dumbass.""

Long, awkward pause.

Dilemma. Do I acknowledge my dumb-assery? Or do I walk away and then move to Canada immediately? I decide to go for it and call myself out for being stupid.

Thankfully, he's understanding. He makes a few jokes and tells me it ""happens all the time"" and brushes it off with complete grace. Turns out he's the coolest dude ever and I, if I haven't mentioned it before, am an enormous dumbass.

tl;dr - asked a kid without a hand to help me because ""I don't have a hand"" because I was carrying something. And because I'm a dumbass."
20,"TIFU by not paying enough attention to my cat


[Kitty Cat](https://i.imgur.com/MdVNuIU.jpg)... yes that was her name. I had her for thirteen years. She was my entire family. I dont have any friends close enough I could even get a hug from. So... yeah.

Always was a chubby cat... about two months ago she got sick, lost weight, couldnt control her pee, and i dropped all the money I had on taking her to the vet, diagnosing her diabetes, and buying her medicine. I followed the directions and at first she seemed to be doing better, getting some weight back, being more active... I was supposed to make sure she ate with her insulin, so I always had canned food and gave her half a can twice a day on top of her dry food always being available. Sometimes I would toss a couple dry treats into her bowl instead of the canned food to get her to start eating, but most of the time it was canned. My coin was stretched pretty thin, so when I ran out of wet food on monday I didnt instantly go get more, and thought she could coast on the dry food/treats for a few days... despite her being rail thin now. Like I said, money was tight by this point, so I was waiting till payday on the first to take her back to the vet for a followup. Then wed night Kitty jumped up onto my cot for only the third time (she hates it, she always used to sleep with me but ever since i got the cot she stopped). Anyway... wed night she jumped up and cuddled, and was asleep on the floor next to the cot when i got called to work. Not one of her normal places to sleep, but i didnt think of it, though I do remember how she felt when I pet her on the way by while she snoozed, and it felt... off. I should have checked her, I just assumed she would be ok until i got back for her shot. But when I came back she wasnt around. It was the loudest silence I ever heard... as I came in and replayed events of the past few days. Noticed her waterbowl was still full from the last time I filled it, and that while she ate the treats put in her bowl it was almost full... and I hadn't clued in.

She wasn't drinking, wasnt eating, climbed onto my cot she hated so much just to get close to me, and even when she moved to sleep she stayed as close as possible. I've pulled out teeth she had broken, pine needles she somehow got behind her eyes, even managed to save her from an infection once by grinding up my own antibiotics I had been prescribed for my wisdoms going bad and calculating the proper dosage for her body weight. She knew to come to me, she was screaming for help and I didnt hear. She trusted me.

I might deserve to have lost her for my stupidity... but she didnt deserve my fuckup. She was a total sweetheart. I'm so sorry Kitty Cat.

TL:DR - cat dead. man sad. rule stupid."
21,"Tifu by accidentally letting my elderly landlord see me in JUST a thong


Today I heard a knock at the door a minute after I heard my boyfriend pull up into the driveway after he got off work.I  figure it's him forgetting his house key again or with his hands full. So, I go to the door and open it and it's not my boyfriend but my 70ish year old male landlord holding our rent reciept! His eyes went super wide and I shut the door yelling out for him to hand it to my boyfriend outside. It was super hot so I was only wearing a thong, no bra or shirt! Apparently my boyfriend was standing outside and finishing a phone call, and the landlord had been visiting the old lady across the hall,  so I didn't know he was here. I don't know if I'll ever be able to face him again!
Tldr; I opened the door in just a thong giving my landlord an eyeful, thinking the person at the door was my boyfriend."
