0,"TIFU by telling my bf i'm pregnant


This happened earlier today but it is bad, it is really bad. Bear with me, english is not my first language. 

I've been with my bf for four years now, from the start he's been firm on not having children so i thought it would be fun to prank him. The idea came from my friend who is pregnant. I went as far as asking her to take another pregnancy test so i could take it to him later that day. That was earlier this morning.  

Before i told him i was building the case, looking anxious, being on the phone talking with an upset tone (the pregnant friend) etc. So when I told him it didn't take long before he bought it. He asked repeatedly me if i was joking, if i was sure, freaked out and was now standing up. Asked me how long it's been, how it happened etc. but after a while he calmed down annd said he need to be alone for a while so he went out. This was a succeess i thought.

An hour or so later the bf was back, this time with a complete different approach, he only asked about me and the baby, how i want to handle it, if we should move in together and then he dropped the fucking bomb. Apperantly this made him feel ""stuff"", feelings he has been suppressing a long time and this is actually the best thing that could have happened. 

We sat there for a long while and to be honest he couldn't be more perfect. I love him. 

I'm a fucking moron, no idea what to do now. 

Tldr; bf don't want children, gf prank him being pregnant, this make him realise he want children, making it a horrible prank. "
1,"TIFU by almost dropping my phone in the toilet


This TIFU just happened a few minutes ago, and the full repercussions are still inbound, but I felt I had to share...

I have been working crazy hours and not getting enough sleep, so I am a bit groggy getting up and heading to the toilet for a bit of business and catching up on Reddit. After scrolling through the front page for a bit, I finish up and stand - but when reaching out to flush, my phone slips out of my hand and heads for the bowl like a cliff diver in Hawaii. Snapping out of my stupor and lunging at it, I grasped the edges of the phone right before it clears the rim. Now I'm fully alert, cursing at my clumsiness.

I sit on my couch with a relieved sigh, and return to Reddit only to be interrupted by a call from my Mom. I hit the speakerphone to answer. ""Are you okay?!? What's wrong?"" she asks in a panic. I tell her I'm fine and as I start to ask her why she is upset, I notice an alarm bell notification icon on my phone that I haven't seen before. I click on it, and it opens up to an emergency contact alert. ""Everything is fine, sorry to scare you, I'll tell you about it later."" I manage to stammer out as I realize what has just happened...

I have a safety feature installed on my phone that I can use to discreetly get help if I am ever in trouble or unable to call for assistance. It send a message to my emergency contacts with location info and snaps from both cameras if I hit a specific combo of buttons, in this case volume down once then power three times. Which I apparently did on accident while trying to keep the phone from finding a toilet-watery grave.

To my horror, I looked at what was sent and saw:

    FROM:   allanstrings

    TO:     Emergency Contacts

    I Need Help!

    &lt;GPS location data&gt;

    &lt;image of said location from Google Maps&gt;

    &lt;image from front camera of fully loaded toilet bowl&gt;

    &lt;image from rear camera including shocked expression 
     and hand reaching for phone with undershot of my exposed junk&gt;
This was sent to my parents, my Ex (whom I forgot to remove from the list), and also to my boss (as I drive a company car and am out in the field for work frequently, where I might encounter an emergency). I have sent everyone the details of what occured, reassuring them that no assistance is needed. I am dreading the coming work week as my office is full of relentless pranksters. I have no idea how I will be able to look my parents in the eye when i see them next.

TL;DR - I accidentally triggered an emergency help text when saving my phone from the toilet drop, sending a request for help with pictures of the full toilet and my junk to my parents, ex, and boss.

I did go to the app store and give the emergency app a glowing review, because damned if it didn't do exactly what it was supposed to..."
2,"TIFU by destroying a week's worth of my PhD research


So, I'm a PhD student studying chemistry, and my life is basically made up of: make the chemical, purify the chemical, measure the properties of the chemical, write about the chemical, repeat. I'm currently doing an internship in a lab that isn't my own and everything is a bit unfamiliar, but I'm getting by... or I thought I was until today. 

All this week I've been doing an experiment where I make an incredibly tiny amount of a chemical that is very, very valuable. Like, the individual ingredients to make this chemical cost thousands of dollars each. It's gonna be used in pharmaceuticals most likely and I'm the poor sucker who has to test-drive making it by hand before they start making it in factories. I have spent months making some of the precursor chemicals from scratch and I have incredibly tiny amounts of them, so this is basically my only chance to do this experiment. So on Tuesday I did this experiment, and yesterday I spent the entire godforsaken day purifying this chemical... it took me 8 hours and you can bet I did not get to celebrate Halloween. The spookiest thing about last night was the amount of coffee I drank. Anyway, so eventually I get this chemical pure and lovely and ready to be measured. It is about 3 drops in the bottom of a tiny, tiny vial, like imagine a urine sample container with a few drops of pee in it, that's what I made. Except it's worth $5000. It was 10pm so I left it in the fridge and went home to pass out. This morning I arrive in the lab and decide to go measure it so I can finally get the last few bits of data I need. I transferred it to a long, thin vial that would fit into the machine I was going to use and put it into my lab coat pocket. I arrived at the machine to find that the vial had cracked in half and spilled all of my precious chemical all over the fucking floor and the inside of my pocket. Kids, don't go to grad school. 

TL;DR Spent a week making a chemical worth thousands of dollars and then spilled it on the fucking floor like an absolute numpty."

4,"TIFU by correcting grammar of someone with possible MHA (multiple system atrophy).

MHA: must of been sth

Me: ""must've"" is the word you're looking for.

MHA: probably but i have mha and it's causing me brain damage and my brain is fucking slowly dying. my writing skills is affected as well

Me: I don't think brain damage could have cause soneone to intentionally typed ""must of"", a common grammatical mistake. I'm not going to say you faked multiple system atrophy, but if you do have MHA, yiu wob't just be misspelling ""must've"".

MHA: you're making fun of me because i'm disabled. you're being a grammar nazi because it makes you feel superior

Me: I was only giving constructive criticism. Learn to take it.

MHA: next you're going to give me constructive criticism on how to walk right

Me: I'm not going to say I'm right. Maybe one day I'll be disabled and misspell words, for which I am open to criticism because I did make a mistake.

MHA: by commenting further you're only trying to justify yourself

Me: Alright, if that's what you think I'm doing, I'll leave you be.

TLDR: I triggered someone who can't take constructive criticism by giving him constructive criticism."
5,"TIFU by lying on my origin


I was working at Paris games week, and a group approach me and ask me something about the whole event. After I replied, one guy ask me if I come from Madagascar.

This question irritates me, I don't know why, but Madagascan always recognise people who come from Madagascar (actually people from the same ethnicity tend to recognise themselves pretty easily), but they will always follow by saying ""oh yeah do you know this guy"" as if I knew every Madagascan or ask me something in Madagascan in which I don't speak a word nor understand a word of it, and will reply by saying ""what a shame"".

So as the guy as me the question, I get pretty irritated, and reply by saying ""no, I'm from Cambodia"" (Madagascan are mix with African and Asian). Little did I know his friend is an actual Cambodian, and start to introduce him.
At this very moment, I start to feel extremely dumb, and just reply by saying ""look I just don't want to tell you"" and left extremely embarrassed.

TL;Dr someone asked me if I come from Madagascar, lied by saying I come from Cambodia, his friend was actually from Cambodia, had to end the conversation embarrassed."

MSA: you're making fun of me because i'm disabled. you're being a grammar nazi because it makes you feel superior

Me: I'm not here to say ""Haha you have brain damage."" I carry no bad intentions, I was only giving constructive criticism. Learn to take it.

MSA: next you're going to give me constructive criticism on how to walk right. you are a clueless kid who thinks he is right

Me: I'm not going to say I'm right. Maybe one day I'll be disabled and misspell words, for which I am open to criticism because I did make a mistake.

MSA: by commenting further you're only trying to justify yourself
