0,"TIFU by telling my girlfriend I knew she cheated on me


This happened approximately six years ago, I was laughing about it with my friend today, who recommend that I post it here. 

&amp;#x200B;

So, flashback to undergrad, things are good and I just started dating this beautiful girl that I had met in class. I was enamored with her, shocked that I loved her so fast, and amazed that she even wanted to date me. The first months are amazing, we can't keep our hands off each other and never seem to be sick of the others company. 

&amp;#x200B;

After a few months into our relationship, I started to notice some concerning symptoms. As you can probably hypothesize, when I pee'd, it burned. At first, I just assumed it must have been something weird with my diet, to be sure, I decided to stop taking creatine just in case. But, as time went on (a few days later), the burning became unbearable. I would literally be struggling to stand while I pee'd because the pain was so intense. After, I would literally lay in my bed in the fetal position until the pain subsided. It was bad. 

&amp;#x200B;

Well, at this point, I was no longer convinced that my diet was causing the symptoms. No, it had to be what I thought unfathomable, my girlfriend must have cheated on me. I hadn't been with anyone else. I hadn't been with anyone else since I began pursuing her, months before we became exclusive. I was shocked. Things seemed so perfect, she seems like such a good person, where had I gone wrong? The thought made my blood boil, until I outright confronted her. I told her I knew she must have been unfaithful because of my symptoms, and asked her if she had similar symptoms. She told me no. I demanded that she come with me to a clinic, that we both take a test, and share our results. She said sure. (looking back at this I feel like a complete dick). We agreed that we would go the next day.

&amp;#x200B;

The same night I confronted my girlfriend, my roommates girlfriend came over to stay at our place. She was being nice and went to do some dishes for us. Around this time my roommates and I had just moved into a new house. In the process all our belongings got shuffled around. As she went to get some dish washing pods, she exclaimed ""why are you guys washing your dishes with laundry detergent!?!?!"" I heard that and it all clicked, holy shit, I've been pissing out bleach?!?! I instantly felt ashamed and immediately apologized to my girlfriend. She took it really well, laughed at the situation, and we forgot about it. Sure enough, a few days later, after our dishes/cups were no longer saturated with bleach residue, my symptoms disappeared. 

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR - Months into a new relationship it began to intensely burn when I pee'd. I told my girlfriend I knew she cheated on me and demanded she go with me to take an STD test. The night before we went, I inadvertently discovered that I had been consuming bleach, causing my symptoms, because my roommates were using laundry detergent pods instead of dish washing soap. "

I’m 23 years old, and I admittedly deserved this for my cheap, filthy ways.

Earlier today I was in a grocery store with a friend who was finishing up a transaction with the cashier. During that time, instead of just breaking change at the register like a normal human being, I thought I would casually walk over by the gumball machines to check for free candy, maybe someone put in a quarter and forgot to collect their reward?

I checked four candy dispensers; all empty. One last chance. I opened up the very last dispenser, and to my joyous, dirty surprise, I find a delicious blue gumball just waiting to be devoured. Without any thought or inspection, I excitedly tossed it in my mouth and bit down. At the exact moment of impact from my teeth to the gumball, blue paint bursts all throughout my mouth and starts flowing down my face…Someone put a motherfucking paintball in the gumball machine’s dispenser.

So there I am, a sad, teary eyed grown man in a heavily populated grocery store, freaking out in disgust as I spit blue paint out of my mouth by the candy machines. I’m certain I looked ridiculous, and I’m still brushing my teeth.

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR  I ate a free gumball which turned out to be fucking paintball. WTF"
2,"TIFU by Listening to Reddit and Eating my Girlfriends Ass, Which Caused a Peanut Allergy.


My girlfriend and I have been together for about a year and a half. She is into butt stuff which is fine with me for the most part, but I’ve always told myself that I would never eat ass. I just think it’s unsanitary and just gross. But she’s dropped hints here and there that she would like me to do it, but I’ve always deflected it. I decided I might finally give it a try, maybe it won’t be so bad. If it’s something she would really enjoy it, why not? But then a concerning thought entered my head.

I have a peanut allergy and my girlfriend LOVES paydays, the peanut candy bars. There is a vending machine at her work and has one most days during her lunch break. I wasn’t sure if it would be safe to eat her ass due to my allergy and her diet. So I decided to ask reddit.

Most of the replies said that it shouldn’t be anything to worry about, so what the hell, let’s go for it.

She gets off work and we start doing our thing and it comes time to toss the ol salad. It wasn’t quite as bad as I thought it was going to be considering she keeps herself pretty clean. But after a few minutes, my throat started to get itchy and I could tell that my eyes were swelling up.

I pulled my face out from between her pooper cheeks and told her I’d be right back and ran to the bathroom. This obviously made her very self conscience. I was in the bathroom watching my face swell up for 5 minutes or so and when I came back I looked like Will Smith from Hitched when he eats the seafood. 

I had to explain to her that I was going to be fine (my peanut allergy is not life threatening or anything too serious) but it was a pretty awkward situation. She told me I didn’t ever have to do it again, so I guess there’s a silver lining to the story.

TLDR: I have a peanut allergy, and ate my girlfriends ass after she had a payday candy bar, causing my entire face to swell up."
3,"TIFU by using my parents PC.


Long. TL;DR at the bottom. 

Mildly NSFW

This is still fresh in my mind as I'm typing. I take some time out of my daily commute home from night shift to make a detour and spend time with my Dad (71 years young) who spends most of the week alone as my mom (62) works all day. Today was just a routine visit. My folks live in the country and don't have trash pickup so I visit with Dad while driving their garbage to the dump. As we are talking I bring up a video I had seen and suggested I share it with him. He agrees and once we get back to the house he suggests I find the video while he does something else. 

Commence Fuckup. 
My Dad has an older model Desktop PC that is quite temperamental and only likes to use Google Chrome. I go to open a window and see that my Dad has 20+ tabs open. All of them were different profiles on FetLife. For those who don't know, FetLife is like MySpace for people with fetishes (bondage, waterworks, furries, etc). I just brushed it off as my dad being a dirty old man. Unfortunately the tab I opened Chrome to was my parents profile page. I not only saw my mother in *very* revealing garments; I also saw my dad gagged and hog tied like a pig at a pork roast. So now, not only do I know my parents are pretty kinky, I also know what it looks like when my dad is getting stuffed like a Christmas turkey. 

TL;DR:
Opened Google Chrome to share something with my dad, only to find out he gets butt-raunched by my mother on the regular. "
4,"TIFU by laughing at my son while he was saying his prayers


So, my 6 year old often likes to make up his own prayers at night time and it's adorable.  

So,  tonight,  he was kneeling at his bed in his jammies looking so cute I could just eat him.  


Him: ""Dear lord Jesus, please watch over me as I sleep tonight. Please look over mommy and daddy and teachers and friends too and the friends I haven't met yet. 

Thank you for dinner and inventing minecraft ...""

*I chuckle lightly*

Him: *turning to me angrily* ""IT'S NOT FUNNY!!""

Me: ""I'm sorry sweetie, I won't do it again""

Him: *resuming his prayer* ""And please don't let my toys come alive tonight. Amen""

And he hopped into bed. 

My stifled laugh sounded like a loud pig snorting, so I just layed my face down in his blankets and pretended like I was praying deeply as I tried to compose my self. 

Then I got up quickly trying to hide my face, and I sneaked one last look to say good night as I shut the door and he was giving me the death glare. 

TL;DR. My son prayed asking Jesus to not have his toys come alive,  I tried to hide my laugh and he gave me the death glare."
5,"TIFU by snacking my wife's sister on the ass during a coed softball game thinking she was my wife.


Most TIFUS don't get posted the same day they happened, this one is no different.
Flash back 3 and a half years ago to our fall league of softball. My wife's family always has a softball team every year in their church league and our team consists of my wife, her 3 other sisters, their husband's, my father in law, myself and normally one random girl that normally changes from year to year.

Just a little back story, my wife is 135 lbs but also has a generously large behind for her size and I being a male, enjoy smacking it for obvious reasons. (told you it was a little back story) 

Cut to me making the 3rd out by catching a fly ball in left center and jogging into the dugout behind everyone. Upon reaching the dug out, I see my wife in front of me walking in. I decided to take my baseball glove, reach back, and slap her on the ass.  Immediately something felt off. I've smacked my wife's ass a lot, she enjoys it and she knows I enjoy it. The reciprocating ripple that normally can be felt when slapping her behind normally was not felt. My wife's sister turns around (who is much much MUCH more conservative when it comes to intimacy or even being premiscoous) and my jaw drops. 
""I.. Uh... Thought you were.. Zelda"" I babbled 
I start panicking because I just spanked my sister in law's ass in front of the entire game and didn't want to be murdered by my wife. I turn some shade of red and started contemplating how to injure myself so I could get away from my soon to be death. 
Luckily my wife and all of her sisters are practically clones of each other, blonde hair blue eyes, and extremely beautiful (my wife being the best out of them all) they have been mistaken for each of the other ones their entire lives.
They all laugh and I am still made fun of every time we play. I now always make sure to look at my wife's face prior to spanking her bottom (in public) 

My wife loves bringing this story up to embarrass me now. 

TL:DR smacked my wife's sister on the ass because they all look the same and have the same body types, didn't get murdered but get made fun of to this day for it still"
6,"TIFU by leaving a suicide note before running outside


Okay so the obligatory this happened a few months back.

A little backstory, I have dealt with severe suicide, have a few (obviously) unsuccessful attempts. Good news; I'm better now and I laugh about it. I was better back then too.

Also worth mentioning I'm into writing short stories and currently a novel.

So back to the fuck-up, a short story I was writing back then started off with a 15 year old girl finding a suicide letter dated 10 years into the future, and is in her own handwriting. I bet you can see where this is going.. So I start drafting the letter and before I finish it with the dating and stuff I get a call from my friend saying she is around and wants to talk, so I get out saying very little to my mom.

After leaving in a hurry and staying outside for a few hours my mom gets worried and calls me. *Shocker* I left my phone at home. (It's really not a rare thing for me to do, it's rare I take it with me unless I'm going to school or a date or something) she goes into my room and sees ""my"" suicide note.

She gets scared and calls my dad. Soon after, my family is driving around looking for me. I walk back home and to my surprise there is police cars and my parents are crying. After a quick explaining and a few hours of scolding everything was fine but I felt terrible for putting my parents through that fear again.


TL;DR: Me, a previously suicidal teen, writes a suicide letter for a short story, then leaves the house in a hurry, parents call the cops thinking I killed myself, I show up eating ice cream and get scolded. Generally felt terrible"
7,"TIFU by moaning with my bedroom door open for five minutes with my dad home


This happened a couple months ago but I finally have the courage to post it on here. TL;DR at the bottom.

So, here's some context. I'm a 26 year old female who lives at home with both her parents. I have a serious boyfriend but we're long distance so we can't exactly have sex. To keep things spiced up, my boyfriend and I regularly send each other nudes and videos. Now, I've never been a quiet person when it comes to sex. I've always liked to express myself and my boyfriend thoroughly enjoys it when I do so I always like to go the extra mile with it when my parents aren't home.

That night, I came home and I noticed that one of my parent's cars was missing and all the lights were out. I was feeling particularly frisky that day and my parents don't go out often so I thought this was a golden opportunity to make a video and take some pics. I walk inside my house and say, ""Hello?"" No answer so I knew it was showtime. I go to my room, leave the door ajar and promptly begin making a video. I was really feeling it that day so I made a good amount of noise while I was doing the deed. I screamed my boyfriend's name and a lot of other obscenities that I won't delve into. That continue for about five minutes before I was satisfied.

After finishing up, I decided I would take some pictures too because why not? I get up off the bed, get ready and then I heard it. A cough from across the hallway, literally 5 feet away. **My dad had been in his room the whole time.** Mortified, I fell to the floor and nearly cried. I texted all my girl friends and they could not stop laughing. I knew I couldn't leave my room but I had my Taco Bell meal sitting on the dining room table. I sprinted to the kitchen, ate Taco Bell in alone in my room and forced myself to go to bed.

The next morning, I saw my dad in the living room. It was the most awkward moment of my life. He didn't say anything except good morning and never brought it up. I mean, how do you bring that up to your daughter. To this day, it hasn't been spoken of and I prefer to keep it that way. I've thoroughly checked my house ever since.

TL;DR: I masturbated as loudly as possible with my bedroom door open while my dad was in the room across from me."
8,"TIFU by having my devout Muslim parents find my alcohol stash


Oh boy, here we go. 

I made a big oops. I knew it as soon as I received a text from my dad while I was at work earlier today, saying “Tell your boss you’re going to be late tomorrow for a family emergency. We have important family business to do in the morning”. My parents know my job is very important, and wouldn’t do anything to jeopardize it. So, my dad telling me to lie to my boss made me realize that something big is going down. Needless to say, I couldn’t focus much on my work for the rest of the day. I texted my dad asking what happened, but he wouldn’t answer. 

Just to preface: my family, particularly my parents, are very strict South Asian Muslims. They follow the religion devoutly, and there are some sins to them that are absolutely unforgivable, the big ones (besides, y’know, obviously not murdering someone) being: don’t eat pork, don’t drink alcohol, and don’t have sex. 

Now, I shall also preface by saying that I am, in no way, religious. I moved home recently after living on campus for college, where I happily lived a double life. I spread my wings, ended up loving alcohol, and did a bunch of other fun, sinful things. 

Now, I knew when I moved home that this kind of fun would need to end, or at least, need to be done with the utmost secrecy. 

But I’m a fucking idiot. 

I bought a six pack of Mike’s last time when I was at the grocery shop. Smuggled it home, hid it in a corner of my wardrobe. The same corner where I hid an old male friend’s clothes that I forgot to return (remember that rule I mentioned saying “no sex”? Well, there’s not many things they could’ve thought when they saw those basketball shirts and undershirt.) 

Anyways, while I was at work today, my mother took the pleasure of organizing and cleaning my room. Which, lucky for me, included my wardrobe.

Holy fucking hell. Not only did they find my alcohol “stash”, they also found a boy’s shirt and shorts. I’m done for.

My mother pretended nothing happened when I walked in the door after work, and I haven’t left my room since I’ve gotten home.

I can only think of this going three ways when they confront me tomorrow morning: 1) I’m getting kicked out, 2) they’re bringing an Imam to perform an exorcism on me since I’m clearly possessed by Satan, or 3) they’re planning on buying me a one-way ticket to their home country so that I could learn a few things from the good, religious girls there. 

Whichever way this goes, I’m absolutely fucked. I’m freshly out of college and haven’t saved enough to find a place of my own (not that I had anticipated, either — my parents expect me to live with them until I’m married; the idea of living on my own is, to them, unthinkable.). 

I guess I won’t really know what’s going to happen until tomorrow morning. Suffice to say, I won’t be getting any sleep tonight.

TL;DR: My devout South Asian Muslim parents found my sinful stash of booze and other things, and I’m anticipating being dealt with accordingly tomorrow morning."
9,"TIFU by attempting to break up a bar fight.


This story begins Friday night, when my mother offered to watch my son overnight so I figured I’d go scope out my old hangout spot.  I get there, everything goes just fine until these two guys (Guy A and Guy B) start getting mad at each other over a game of pool.

This first disagreement was resolved quick and painlessly, no problem right?  Boy was I wrong.

I used to bartend at this bar so I’m familiar with stupid people and diffusing most situations.  The female working this night asked me to keep an eye on things.  No problem.

So Guy A phones a friend (Guy C) to which I was unaware of.  Guy B decides it is time to leave, and wouldn’t you know it, Guy A does as well.  These two knuckleheads start bickering in the parking lot and start doing the thing where each one is waiting for the other to throw a punch, which in the past was a good time to squeeze in and get everyone to their cab, uber, or whatever.

As I started getting involved Guy C pulls up and sees me in his buddy’s face.  He parks his car and B-lined straight to me, shoving me from behind causing me to fall real hard.  Whatever I thought, I’ve fallen before, things quieted down and everything was fine.

I woke up at about 6am and my fingers on both hands were going numb so I went to the ER.  Two hours later I get the news that I broke both of my wrists and have a follow up with an orthopedic surgeon on Monday.

Basically I just wanted to take this opportunity to tell reddit I have two broken arms and my mom is on the way over, I’m going to show her “that post,” haha.

TL:DR - broke both of my arms stopping a bar fight from happening

"
10,"TIFU by not staying in touch with my friends


Obligatory this happened many years ago, but I just realized it is a good story to tell here. Also, throwaway account since I still cringe thinking about it.

One of my friends (we'll call him Carl) invited me to a party at his house. We used to hang out a lot, but for no apparent reason we lost touch for a while so I was excited to get a chance to catch up with him. When I got to the party, it was packed. Tons of people, most of whom I'd never met before, but I knew a few and naturally gravitated towards them. I also ran into Carl, but we only spoke briefly before he had to move on to mingling with other guests. After about an hour, I ran into a woman who I knew in college (who we'll call Karen), but hadn't seen her since, so it was interesting to try to figure out who she had a connection with at the party. Since it seemed rude to just outright ask ""What are you doing here?"", I tried to ease into my investigation, but didn't get very far because she was quickly called away to something else. Then after little while longer, Carl gets everyone's attention for what looked like a toast and I noticed that for some reason he had just put his arm around Karen.

At this point, I should probably explain that while I am not very good at socializing with complete strangers, I do seem to have a pretty quick wit at times, especially when it comes to retelling jokes from comedy shows and movies at the perfect time. So, [the proposal scene in Big Daddy](https://youtu.be/vWyPfvAbUOQ) immediately popped into my head. If you don't know the scene, then I'd recommend that you click the link. But, if you just want the text-only version, Kevin (Jon Stewart's character) is about to propose to Corinne (Leslie Mann's character) in front of a group of friends and Kevin naturally hesitates a bit to get the words out. Sonny (Adam Sandler's character) doesn't think that Corinne and Kevin are compatible so, to protect Kevin, the following dialogue takes place:

Sonny: ""You're not proposing, are you?!?"" 

Kevin: ""Uhh, yeah, pal. I am.""

Sonny: ""Well... think about it, you know?""

Corinne: ""God, Sonny, shut up!""

I thought that repeating this scene would be perfectly hilarious since these two are just friends anyway, so bomb's away. I yell out from the back of the room ""You're not proposing are you?!?"" and waited for the laughter to ensue. To my disappointment, other than a few chuckles from some people (mostly people who knew me), I was met with silence and a pretty dirty look from Karen. That's when it hit me like a ton of bricks. Oh my goodness, Carl actually is proposing to Karen. I didn't even know they were good friends, let alone dating. Out of sheer panic and my inexplicable urge to immediately ease the tension, I double-down and yell out ""Well... think about it, you know?"". Again, mostly silence and Karen was now throwing daggers at me with her eyes. Carl continued on with the proposal, which actually turned out to be a proposal announcement. The actual proposal already happened and Karen already said ""Yes"", but this was the first time that everyone was finding out about it, so I'm pretty sure I still ruined the experience for a lot of people.

Afterwards, I apologized to both of them profusely trying to explain that I didn't know that they were even dating. Carl said he thought it was hilarious and was cool about it, but even now I'm pretty sure it will still be quite a while before Karen forgives me, if ever. I still cringe whenever I think about it.

TL;DR Went to a party and my friend (host) starting making a toast. I thought I would be funny by re-enacting the proposal scene in Big Daddy and sarcastically him to reconsider his ""engagement"" his friend standing next to him. Turns out that they were both actually dating and actually announcing their engagement."
11,"TIFU by breastfeeding at the eye doctor


This morning I had my first eye appointment in about 10 years and was feeling really excited to get in some new glasses! 

I made my 3 year old son an appointment for the same time, so my husband came along to help. This also meant we had our 3 month old daughter with us.

The appointments were hectic with a toddler who didn’t want his eyes checked and so it took a little while to get through both visits.

By the end, when it was time to pick out frames, our daughter was starting to cry and ready to be fed. I decided the easiest thing for everyone would be if I fed her while I picked out my frames and sat to have them measured. 

She was starting to get loud so I didn’t want to waste time running to the car for my cover, but I was wearing a nice loose shirt that I was able to lift over one breast and drape back down to cover my stomach so that nothing was showing. It been a while since I fed her so  my breasts were pretty full. 

Everything was just about done, and I was sitting with the optometric technician at her desk, paying while sitting and feeding the baby. I leaned forward to sign the receipt and right at that moment, my baby unlatched from my breast and leaned back to stretch. My full breast was not prepared to stop so quickly, and the milk was still shooting out in the form of 3 strong jets directly at the technician and all over her desk.

I covered up quickly, wiped her desk with my shirt, apologized profusely, and left.

TL;DR was breastfeeding my baby and accidentally shot milk all over the desk at my optometrist. "
12,"TIFU by wearing a custom wedding dress


I’ve been married almost a year, and while the marriage is spectacular, and the wedding was 96% perfect, there was one significant issue that I can’t vent about to anyone in my real life, so I’ll share here:

My nipples.

When I first got engaged, I showed a friend a picture of a couture wedding gown with a very deep v neck. I have tiny titties for the first time in my life, and was excited to try out some styles I had previously felt were off limit. My friend was so excited for me, and said that her mom could make the dress and would love to do it for me as a wedding present. I gratefully accept, and am totally pumped.

We do my measurements a year out. Three months before my wedding, I come by for a fitting and there’s definitely the start of the beginning of a garment there. She’s doing this for me for free, as a huge favor, so I stay chill.

One week before my wedding, I make the trek down to where the friends mother lives, and it’s like 75% done? I’m a little concerned about the neckline, and I ask her to try and get the fabric to lay as close to my skin and as flat on my skin as possible. I refuse to panic. If nothing works out, I’ll wear my mom’s wedding dress and it’ll be fiiiiine. I’m not like a regular bride, I’m a chill bride!

THE DAY BEFORE my wedding, my friends mom express ships the dress to me. It’s here! My dream dress! So excited!

In the rush of everything, I don’t have time to try the dress on until I’m putting it on for the ceremony. All my friends tell me how great it looks, and it does look great,- if I’m standing absolutely stock still and standing straight up.

However, as I go through our wedding day I realize that this shit /does not fit at all/. It’s mostly fine through the ceremony, but a big chunk of stitching comes undone during the after ceremony pictures. Whatever, it’s in a place I can hide! This is fine! Everything’s fine.

Then the reception. Lord, the reception. There’s a picture of me dancing with my dad, and he has this expression on his face that so clearly reads “I love you, im very happy for you, I support this marriage, however I can see both of your nipples in this moment and I am not especially pleased”. During the first dance I flash everyone. Everyone. My grandparents? Here’s yo descendant’s titties! Godmother? I know you haven’t seen them since I was a baby, but hey, here they are! Creepy uncle? Sure, why the fuck not, get an ogle in. In the video of our first dance, you can see my husband slowly figure out what’s going on and kind of clamp his hand to my chest towards the end to protect the remaining scraps of my modesty.

I got super drunk, decided everyone had already seen everything they could possibly see, gave up on caring and danced my ass off.

I wrote my friends mom a thorough thank you note and offered to reimburse her for the fabric costs.

Lessons? Idk, look a gift horse in the mouth sometimes. I’d seen things that my friends mom had made before and they were incredible, but I think maybe she put off my dress till the last minute and did a rush job. I should have faced the music a little earlier and at least bought some boob tape in case everything didn’t work out the way I was desperately hoping they would. Learn from my lesson: if someone wants to do something for you for your wedding, or for anything else, really, it’s okay to have desires to express them. I should have pushed her more to have more done at the three month appointment, and sounded the alarm more urgently when the neckline didn’t fit at the final fitting.

But all in all, the wedding was hella fun, and the pictures turned out great!

Tl;dr I trusted a friends mom too much to make my wedding dress and wound up displaying my baby nozzles to me and my husband’s entire group of family and friends "
13,"TIFUpdate: TIFU by having my devout Muslim parents find my alcohol stash


Alright, guys. I really didn’t expect [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/avmf13/tifu_by_having_my_devout_muslim_parents_find_my/) to blow up, but needless to say, it did.

Before I begin, and I’m putting this BEFORE I write the update so that it’s being read, I need to clear a few things up.

I know that Muslim extremists exist. I’d be an idiot if I denied it. But so do extremists of other religions. Devout does not equal extremist. My parents would never send me to my death, for everyone who was worried about an honor killing happening. They’re afraid of even the slightest conflict. I’ve had people in my family sent to live in the motherland for a few months to “learn” the old ways, that’s about it. As I mentioned in my original post, my parents love me. They wouldn’t KILL me. Jesus, guys. Basically, what I’m saying is that honor killings are conducted by extremists. My family is religious, not extreme. I’m going to live. Chill. 

Also, I really appreciate all the hints/help/tips/etc. I'm still in disbelief that so many people have offered me a place to stay, and others with such helpful and lovely messages. You guys rock. The world isn't so bad after all, huh?


**Now, the update**:


So one part that I forgot to mention in the updates on the original post was that I zoomed out of the house as quickly as I could because it turns out that my mom not only found my alcohol stash, but also a few condoms. After she found my alcohol, I guess she went through the rest of my stuff and dug deep (*real* deep -- I mean that shit was hidden in Hades' rectum) to uncover all my sinful secrets.   

Now, before everyone starts calling me a whore (and I happened to get a good number of people messaging me, calling me exactly that), those condoms have been in my bag for ages. My college had their annual involvement fair and our health services department threw 'em around like candy. Lady at the booth tossed me a few. ""Never know when you'll need 'em"", she told me.   

Anyway, it wasn't until this morning that I found out that she found the condoms. They weren't where I had hidden them. And that's when I panicked. I had to leave the house. Alcohol’s one thing, but sex is a whole different ballgame. No, thanks.   

As I mentioned before, my parents called me a bunch of times before I finally called back. The last straw was when my mom called my workplace asking to be transferred to me.

She got me.

I hung up on her and called her from my cellphone. I caved. Went home. If I hadn't, I wouldn't have been able to focus at work. Told my boss my parents were spam calling me and I really needed to get home, and that I'd be right back. Fortunately, she was more than understanding.  

Cut to me arriving home -- my parents are sitting at the kitchen table. My dad's staring into his coffee, leaning on his hand. My heart dropped to my stomach. I feel like absolute garbage for disappointing him. Mom was trying to diffuse the tension by making small talk. Dad went to the room to lay down. He couldn't even look at me. Which, sadly worked out because I couldn't bare to face him. It broke my heart knowing that I permanently messed up our relationship.  

I sat down with my mom. She didn't waste a second getting right to it. ""I want you to be clear and honest with me. I'm your mother, and I can tell if you're lying, so please just don't hide anymore"". Her voice was quivering as she said this, which threw me off guard. I promised I would, which I didn't, which in turn made me feel shitty, but it's better than what would've have gone down if I had been honest.  

""Are you seeing anyone? From work or from college?"" No mention of the alcohol yet. Like I said, sex is a whole different ballgame. Anyways, I told her no, I wasn’t. I explained to her exactly where I got those condoms from (Booth Lady), and played dumb., ""I didn't know how to dispose of those things, and I figured you'd think something if you had seen them in the trash, so I just hid them in my bag because I didn't know what else to do with them."" A whole lot of playing dumb and convincing her that “I-would-never-let-a-man-touch-me” occurred before she believed me. She was holding her breath this whole time, and as soon as I explained myself, she broke down. ""I can forgive you for the alcohol but the most important thing for us women is keeping our bodies pure and keeping away from bad men."" In my head, I rolled my eyes, but I also needed her to believe me, so I feigned being offended that she didn't think that I believed the same thing as her.  

The alcohol was mentioned next. I had to come semi-clean about this; I knew I couldn't expect all-around wins. I explained to her that while I was packing to move out last semester, my old roommate gave me the six-pack since she didn't like it (and yes, it was Black Cherry!). There was one bottle gone. I told her I just wanted to try it, that I was surrounded by people drinking all the time, so I wanted to see what the hype was all about, but that it was stupid of me to do so. I apologized for disrespecting both her and my dad in their own house, as they're the ones who've raised me, taken care of me, fed me, and kept a roof over my head. This, I genuinely meant. I apologized for disappointing them.  

The clothes were explained as me finding them in the laundry room at college last semester, and I decided just to keep them, for the hell of it. Somehow, she believed it. I won’t question it. 

A little bit of lecturing naturally occurred. She mentioned being disappointed, and I cried a little, partly because of relief, and partly because I felt bad. I don’t know what would’ve happened if I had been completely honest. I’m just glad that my explanations were believable. 

At the end of the day, this was a FU that happened because I'm a fucking idiot. It was only a matter of time until I got caught. I knew I'd have to find a different hiding place for those things but I never got around to it. I won't make any excuses for my dumb-fuckery. 

Note: Everyone saying the real FU was getting caught with Mike’s of all things is absolutely correct. Couldn't I have been caught with a bottle of Grey Goose at least?

Note II: I'm Bangladeshi, for all of those who were curious. Dunno why everyone assumed I was Pakistani  ¯\_(ツ)_/¯

Note III: I'm surprised as to how so many people thought I was a guy. All those comments / messages gave me a good chuckle. Huh. 

TL;DR: Lied a little, confessed a little. I get to still live at home. "
14,"TIFU by lying to an inquisitive old man on the bus


Last September I moved to Taiwan; I live and work here. I really like it here but the capital is really spread out and, unable to drive, I spend a bit over two hours riding buses each day.

Now, I love reading but have less than stellar time management skills, so this is actually a big plus for me. It's like insurance against myself. No matter how poorly I manage my daily schedule and work flow, I have two hours a day that I can't really do anything other than read. It's great.

Normally.

One day, on behalf of having an oddly full bus, I couldn't sit down. No big deal, I just went to the front of the bus and stood. Listening to podcasts floats my boat, too. There was even a bit of room for me to lean against the wall. 

So here I am, getting comfy as can be in a packed bus and preparing to learn about Anaximander and the Boundless, when I hear it. It's a small voice, like a little fawn not quite sure that it can stand: Hello. No response. Hello, a little louder this time.

I looked calm, but I had been hoping from a very deep part of my soul to hear a response to that question. Having gotten a good survey of the bus during my hunt for a seat I knew fully well that there was only one person that such a hesitant hello could probably be directed towards, and that was me. 

You see, East Asia spends a lot of money on English education but there aren't really that many opportunities to use it in daily life. Even after graduating, lots of people continue to study independently. The result is that countries like Taiwan and Japan are full of people who have studied English damn near their entire lives but may never have had an English conversation or anything like that. 

Just imagine, then, that you've studied English for ten years and suddenly see a white dude. I don't want to use too broad of a brush here, because it is by no means everyone, but a number of people do jump at this opportunity like kids for lollipops. At least once a week I get approached by random people I don't know who just want to say hello and give their English a test drive. Private English lessons start at like USD $20.00/hour, but this is a free chance.

Now, I love kids and I do understand that I might genuinely be the first foreigner some of these youngsters have ever seen in person, let alone interacted with, so normally I try to play my part. Furthermore, I KNOW I look foreign, so I expect this sort of thing. I accept to be treated like in different because, well, I obviously don't belong. Part of living in a new country is accepting that you're no longer the normal one.

But it does get old, especially when the person copping a linguistic feel isn't a nine year old who only knows a few salutations but rather an old dude on the bus... Of all times, just as I'm trying to relax for a few minutes before work by enjoying a podcast I've been looking forward to the entire weekend. (I listen exclusively while in transit).

In cases like this, I pretend not to hear. After all, I either have headphones in or my nose in a book, so most people leave me be.

Normally.

Upon seeing that I wasn't going to respond to hello, the guy leaned over and waved his hand in front of my eyes. I jumped a little bit and looked at him, at which he repeated, hello. I blinked a few times and returned his hello before starting my podcast and looking out the window.

A minute later or so I feel a tap on my shoulder. I ignore it at first; Taiwanese buses are sort of like roller coasters and this one was full, so bumping into strangers wasn't out of the ordinary. Then I get tapped again and again and again so I turn around... Of course, it's the old guy.

He smiles and waves and asks where I'm from and how I'm doing. I respond to him in Mandarin that I don't speak English. Sorry.

He responds, ""but.. you're white"", so I tell him that a person can't necessarily speak English just because they're white. You're Asian. Do you speak Japanese?

I paused, it didn't seem to sink in. So I continued.

I'm Russian. In Russia, we speak Russian. I don't speak English very well. Sorry.

This time he squints and frowns. Oops. Sometimes I goof on the tones. Was it RUSsian? rusSIAN?

I give up and respond in Russian: look, I'm Russian, damnit. I don't speak your fucking English. Let a guy breathe, for fuck's sake. (Russian is actually a beautiful language and I apologise in advance to any Russians that I was taught a very bastardized version of your tongue).

Now, I'm not Russian, but I was with a Russian girl for a long time and lived in Russia for a year. My Russian is far from perfect, or even good, but I'm very comfortable speaking it all the same. A Russian would know I'm not Russian immediately, but for non-natives it seems to be convincing enough. 

I've only been in this situation twice before and, upon hearing my sort of exasperated ranting in a language that isn't English, most people are like ohhhhh, sorry. They don't want to speak Mandarin; if they can't practice English with me, they're suddenly less interested in a conversation. 

Not this guy.

Suddenly he cuts me off, to my incredible surprise, in Russian: citizen/comrade, how are you, sir?! 

I'm too shocked to speak, so he continues. Apparently he teaches history/international relations at a local university and his area of specialty is twentieth century Russia. What are the odds?

Not having an exit I resign to losing my me-time for the day. We go through a typical self introduction and then half an hour or so later he announces that his stop has arrived and we part ways. 

I sort of laugh it off: this was perhaps the most serendipitous situation of my life. I content myself knowing that I now have a sort of interesting story to tell people when I go home, given that people think it must be so exciting living a broad and won't accept that it's basically the same play with a different backdrop.

But it doesn't end there.

Cue today, a few months later. I'm riding a much later bus than normal becuase I had some stuff to do off site. The bus is packed again, no place to sit, so I put away Isaka Koutaro while reminding myself to avoid this route in the afternoon. Time for a podcast. That's when I hear it:

Zd.. zd.. zdravstvyte!

You guessed it. Same dude.

Introductions out of the way he leads into a notably more political conversation and starts asking for my input on various Russian leaders, events in the 90's, current events, stuff like that. Some of this stuff gets complained about enough in daily Russian life that in comfortable giving answers: fuck Obama, Gorbachev is an idiot, something about the Belarusian president and carrots, more importantly who cares about whatever happens with Turkey just make up with them already because we miss cheese. 

But we very quickly step out of my league and he begins showing me pictures from a recent trip to Moscow: statues of people that, as a Russian, I should know. 

Most people would give up here, but having already lied about my nationality once, I decided to go for double or nothing. 

Spain is a popular vacation destination for wealthy Russians. I tell him that my dad fell in love with a Spanish girl and, the European visa being stronger, I was raised in Spain. So I can speak Russian, becuase we speak it at home, but actually I don't know the most about Russian history/culture because I went to school in Spain. 

Dude blinks. 

... Hablas español?

Trying to stop my jaw from dropping I inform him that, yes, it would have been difficult to receive a Spanish education without speaking Spanish.

His eyes twinkle, like a six year old looking at a huge lollypop.

He switches to Spanish and explains that his wife is actually from Spain; she studied abroad in Taiwan like thirty years ago and they've been together ever since. 

He takes out his phone and begins showing me pictures, and then suddenly there a QR code for his line account. I don't know what to do so I scan his code and friend him.

He tells me that this is the most incredible coincidence and that I simply must go visit his home sometime. He's so excited that he misses his stop and doesn't realize it till we're at mine.

I wait another stop then get off and walk a few kilometers to work.

I have no words.


TL;DR : I lied about my nationality, twice, in the hopes that a nosy old dude would leave me alone. He turned out to speak both the other languages I speak. I ran into him twice. Now my commute is an hour longer becuase I have to take a different bus for fear of running into him again.

15,"TIFU by letting my husband carry me to the bathroom


This incident happened this weekend when my husband and I were enjoying a mini vacation. We were hanging out in our hotel room when it was time to get ready for dinner. I got undressed to go shower when my husband offered to carry me to the bathroom while I was naked. I said yes but soon realized my mistake because I really had to pee.

Once we entered the bathroom the need to pee was too strong but I knew I could make it...until I saw that the toilet lid was down. Just like Pavlov's dog, I saw the toilet and my bladder was ready to go, there was no turning back. I screamed ""I'm going to pee!"" So he dropped me on the floor to get the toilet ready but it was too late. I pee'd on the floor as an adult woman. 

I started laughing and said I pee'd but he didn't believe me until he saw the puddle under me. Guess it's too late for him to be disgusted and leave me now! 

Tl;dr: TIFU by letting my husband carry me to the bathroom naked when I had to pee. This resulted in premature urination"
16,"TIFU by not waiting 30 seconds more


So yeah today it happened worst fuck up of my life to this day.

Today I was supposed to meet up with my girlfriend so as usual I wait for my mom to comeback from work so I can take her car and drive to my girlfriend’s house since it’s a lot faster than going by bus or walking.

We have these automatic garage doors that open by going up (most of you probably know what I mean) 

I entered my mom’s car, clicked the button to open the garage doors, put the car in reverse and waited for a bit as I always do (checked my mirrors as well obv, idk how I didn’t notice that doors aren’t fully open, don’t ask me) well today I waited for like 30 seconds too short ending up smashing garage doors and top of my mom’s car.
I’m still shaking when typing this, my mom is pissed as hell.
Repairs are going to be expensive, and my savings won’t even cover 1/3 of the damage I’ve done. 
Never been so disappointed in myself as I am now 

tl;dr didn’t wait long enough for garage doors to open, ended up smashing roof of my mom’s car and the doors."
