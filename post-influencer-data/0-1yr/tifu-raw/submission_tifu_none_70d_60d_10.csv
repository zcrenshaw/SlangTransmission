1,"TIFU by telling a stranger I can’t wait to fuck them tonight


Disclaimer- this happened at least 6 years ago and was deeply repressed by shame. I only remembered it in a conversation with my wife when she asked, “What was your most embarrassing moment?”

So I was at a work party, and my gf at the time (not currently my wife) offered to pick me up and drive me home, knowing I would get fully sloshed at the party. She was right.

On the way home, I ask her to pull into a gas station for cigarettes. She pulls her light blue Jeep into the parking lot, I stumble out of the Jeep, go in, and complete my purchase. 

I (over aggressively) yank open the passengers door to the blue Jeep, plop myself down on the seat, and say to my gf. “I can’t wait to get home and fuck the shit out of you.”

I was not expecting to get hit in the face. I also did not expect the loudest goddamn screaming I’ve ever heard in my life. Instinctively, I covered up my face and wondered what the hell I said wrong, as it was not uncommon for either of us to say something like that to each other. 

The screaming was intense and sounded very scared, so I couldn’t really make out what my gf was yelling, until between punch 3 or 4, when I heard, clear as a bell, “You fucking rapist get the fuck outta my car.”

WHOA WHOA WHOA instant sobriety. I uncovered my face and looked up, finally dawning on me that although I was in a blue Jeep, it was not my gfs blue Jeep. My gfs identical blue Jeep was parked next to- and blocked by- this random woman’s blue Jeep. 

I finally tumbled out of the car, went to my gfs car, and told her what happened. She convinced the woman not to call the police to tell them about some crazy guy breaking into her car and telling her he was gonna fuck her. 

I did not fuck anyone that night. 

TL;DR: drunkenly got into the wrong car, assumed the driver was my gf, and told her I was going to fuck her"
2,"TIFU by being on this subreddit too much and hurting my boyfriend's feelings


Anyone remember the TIFU of the guy that suck his own dick in front of his assistant at a Bachelorette party? He included a drawing of how he did that.

So my boyfriend was doing some stretches on bed, and one of the stretches is the same pose as what that guy drew.

I commented about it and said ""Hey that's how the TIFU guy sucked his own dick."" 

My boyfriend being silly then try to see if he can reach his too and I gave him a little push.
Obviously he isn't as flexible (just like how most people are not) and I said;

""Well it's okay, he did mention afterall that he also have a big dick""

And in that moment I felt as if time slowed down and I can see his face going into this super disappointed look.

And that is how I fucked up by hurting his feelings.


TL;DR: I told my boyfriend he have a small sick indirectly and unintentionally and hurt his feelings"
3,"TIFU By Accepting a Proposition for a Threesome


Obligatory this didn't happen today, it happened last summer. Newly obligatory this will not end in incest. I didn't accidentally eat out my cousin or half-sister or whatever dumbass erotica you're all posting lately. Obligatory TL;DR at bottom.

&amp;#x200B;

It's a perfect summer night in 2018. I'm leaving a job that I hate with my life, freshly broken up with, ready to throw on my leather and fuck anyone in arm's reach. I turn up to my local watering hole right before 1 AM,  toss back a couple beers and post up, alone, on the outskirts of the main bar.

&amp;#x200B;

Last call rings out, the bar is mobbed. I lock eyes with a moderately attractive girl (MAG) who approaches me shortly after. She's equal parts drunk/horny, and does not hesitate to let me know. She's celebrating a friend's birthday with a squad of girls, one of whom sidles up to us and starts hitting on me hard.

&amp;#x200B;

MAG is totally fine with this, and the friend would land on the higher end of the BMI chart, leading me to believe I'm being hit with a bait and switch. They SWIFTLY disprove that theory by literally asking if I ""want both"" of them. Worth noting that this is the only time I've been anywhere near a threesome, before or since, so I jumped at the chance.

&amp;#x200B;

Next thing I know, we're in a cab on the way back to whoever's house the birthday pregame was. There is alcohol EVERYWHERE. They're feeding me shots/cold buffalo chicken dip like it's my last day on earth. Some girl is crying on the couch.

&amp;#x200B;

My drunk ass picks up the signal that an ex-boyfriend is the cause of this girl's sorrow. Having been recently broken up with, I know exactly where her head is at. Having done far too many shots, I am not scared to console this crying stranger. Soon I will be the Advice Champion, and fuck every girl in the house.

&amp;#x200B;

I launch into my speech, hitting every point she so desperately needs to hear:

* You're so much better than him.
* He *OBVIOUSLY* doesn't deserve you.
* You'll look back and laugh at this in a month.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm now starting to notice that the cheers and applause I was waiting for are actually all death stares, even a few dropped jaws. As it turns out, this girl's boyfriend didn't break up with her. 

&amp;#x200B;

No, he fucking ***DIED.***

&amp;#x200B;

The guy died in a car accident and I'm telling her she'll be laughing about it in a month. Nobody fucked anybody that night.

&amp;#x200B;

**TL;DR:** I was invited back to a girl's house for a threesome, got very drunk and tried to console a girl crying over her ex-boyfriend that she's better than him, etc. He didn't break up with her, he fucking died."
4,"TIFU by realizing my History teachers gave me a horribly skewed version of what happened leading up to the Civil War.


I had 4 years of ROTC in high school and 2 Semesters of American History. (2 separate teachers) So, not a history major, but I have absorbed a lot of material on the Civil War. And I realized today that it was horseshit and I got hoodwinked.

Before that, like most people, when someone asked me why the Civil War happened, my answer would have been ""slavery"". And that definitely was an issue. But my teachers presented it as thought it was not the forefront issue. They gave me a lot of info--what the economy was like and what other industries aside from slavery were doing, how industry was just taking off in the North, what Europe was doing and why that was important, etc. --There was a lot. And it made sense, because I found it very believable that politicians and businessmen were doing underhanded shit and trying to hide it behind or around the slavery issue. So they essentially presented me with the idea that slavery was not the main reason for the civil war, it was business. Again, super plausible. This was all being presented with an attitude of ""Now let me tell you what REALLY happened"". 

Im SIX semesters of this shit, no one had even mentioned the Declarations of Secession, the actual physical documents the states wrote when they left. I had no idea they existed. I read them all today, and holy shit that stuff reads like a dystopian nightmare. They were ALL about slavery and how it was ""the greatest institution ever conceived"" and that it had to be protected. There's no way this wasn't THE forefront issue, after reading those papers. I messaged some friends who had the same class to make sure i wasn't remembering wrong and, I wasn't. I told them of my discovery, they had never heard of the Secession declarations either. Ugh.

Reddit let me know earlier how absolutely wrong I was. I don't care about people calling me dumb, I'll own that. I just trusted my teachers to give me facts, and I got this...propaganda. I am disgusted with myself for carrying around incorrect information for so long. I hope my stupidity is isolated, but I wonder how many people are out there thinking they know something but actually don't? 

TL;DR I thought the Civil War was about slavery, my history teachers convinced me that it wasn't, then reddit proved them (and me) totally wrong as fuck."
5,"TIFU By Becoming an Accidental Active School Shooter


This happened in the Oughties. TL/DR below.

My (relatively small) HS held an unexpected Live Active Shooter drill.  It was the first time they had ever done this. I don't know who developed this genius procedure. It actually makes no sense because of how they initiated it.

We had once previously practiced what to do in this event maybe a week prior, kind of casually. The teachers were aware of the timing of this drill but didn't tell us because... The trauma would help us react better? No idea. In fact, I remember our teacher (and likely all others) calling in at one point probably to check in that everybody was accounted for. 

However, it so happened that I was kicked out of class just prior to the announcement. My teacher was pretty flustered after minutes of me being a clown, and just yelled at me to get out - but he was super frantic about me getting to the office immediately. Now I understand why. (His mistake, but I played my part soon after)

On my way to the office (I was taking my time of course) the lights went out as though a main breaker were flipped, just the way they all went out immediately. Emergency exit lights came on, and the principle came over the intercom telling all teachers some code phrase which basically initiated the lock-up/lights-out/cower-in-the-corner procedure. I was truly in a WTF state.

Here's where I F-up. Now I am the only dummy walking the hallways. Given the layout of this building, when I tell you it was dark, I mean ""you could hardly see your own hand"" dark - even with the small distant exit emergency light down the hall. And it was completely silent now. It all happened in a matter of seconds. I can't say I was scared necessarily because we all knew that there'd likely be a live drill at some point. Still, given my aversion to our principle since I was in trouble a lot, and not knowing what to do, I just ran following the wall with my hand back to my class and started banging on the door. I assumed my teacher knew what was happening and I didn't want to be in more trouble so I just yelled 

\#""HEY LET ME IN!!""

The entire class of 20 kids in the dark instantly screamed at the top of their lungs, which then caused the adjacent classroom who was also in complete darkness (no windows on this side of the building), to also start screaming and panicking. This coalescence of fear became so loud that nobody knew what the hell was happening and the teachers were of course required to keep the doors shut no matter what, nor were they supposed to communicate with anyone outside their door till given an all clear as far as I recall.  (Again, this was not a well thought-out plan).

Now of course, my teacher must have called the office - but the message wasn't relayed properly and I'll never know what he told them - because somebody came around the corner and in the loudest voice I had heard by that point in my life said 

\#""GET ON THE GROUND!!!"" 

There was a police officer visiting the school to oversee the drill! So whether he was taking the opportunity to do his part in acting or really thought I somehow picked the worse possible day to commit mass murder, I don't know. He did not have a gun out, just his flashlight. He grabbed me up and took me to the office.

The rest was a huge blur but essentially I was not punished for THAT, but I got extra shit for my classroom behavior given the context. Girls in my class (and guys in touch with their emotions) were seriously traumatized after this, and there was an assembly held the same day where we were all apologized to for not running this drill knowingly first. Parents were pissed, it was a whole thing.

&amp;#x200B;

TL/DR: Became unaccounted for just as an Active School Shooter Drill was initiated, ran around and scared the life out of roughly 50 people."
6,"TIFU by unwrapping a condom


So this happened earlier in the week but is NSFW so posting on the weekend. Also on my throwaway acc. since I don't want this story going back to the IRL me.

So at uni as apart of their safe sex promotion, we get given condoms in our ""welcome to uni"" packs for students who live in the university-run accommodation. I'd always chucked these in my drawer for ""future use"" if the situation requiring them ever arose. It never has and so I took them home over summer and they've been sitting in my drawers at home ever since.

Anyway, I'm on intersemester break right now so I (19M) was back home, and poking around in my old stuff found some of them. I decided I'd open the wrapper since I'd never actually used one before or tried putting one on (parents took me out of sex-ed for religious reasons), and I thought it might be good to try one on and try out masturbating with it, so promptly opened the wrapper.

As I discovered, and the majority of the sexually active population probably know, condoms come kind of lubed already and for whatever reason I took a smell since I could kind of tell it smelt weird.

When I did this, I realised that I had not only smelt this scent before, but knew exactly how it tasted. I have memories of chewing on uninflated balloons quite a lot when I was younger (same with rubber bands) and the one memory in particular which became very vivid of was finding a balloon in my parents room and happily chewing on that. Except now I realise it *wasn't* a balloon and was in fact, a used condom. I felt pretty sick then.

I wish I could delete memories and that I'd never remembered/realised this.

TL;DR  got out a condom to try it out, realised I've tasted condoms before."
7,"TIFU by missing my train and watching a woman die


I'm keeping this very short as this happened just hours ago and I'm still trembling.

This morning I missed my usual train by a couple of minutes. However, another train was scheduled to come 12 min later. I get to the end of the platform and take a seat on the bench and people watch. So as I'm waiting a normal Express train passes through the station and I then notice this woman headphones in and on her phone start crossing the tracks after the express passed.  Well there were two trains an inbound and outbound. She stepped right in front of the engine of the outbound train throwing her in my direction. I was 30 feet away. My knees about gave out just seeing it and I've been trembling since.This moment will forever haunt me. 

So those of you who run across the tracks or walk around in their tech bubble please for all of us look up and use common sense.  Your life is to short and the people you effect is much greater. 



Tldr; Missed my train and watched a woman not paying attention get hit by a train"
8,"TIFU by misunderstanding the ugly duckling


The other night, I was out getting a drink with some friends from university, and for some reason or another, the conversation turned to swans.

Now, as a kid, I remember reading the Ugly Duckling - and for some reason, I completely misunderstood it. Not the lesson of the story or anything, but the reason that the duckling was ugly in the first place. The reason being that it was, of course, a swan.

But for some reason, I got a few wires crossed, and thought it was in fact a duckling like the rest. Instead of thinking that the swan was a different kind of bird, I thought that swans were just male ducks. For some reason I never stopped thinking it, even though I’ve seen plenty of ducks, and literally had the differences between male and female ones pointed out to me before. I don’t know why it never got through to me. I guess I just thought they were different kinds of duck or something.

What this means is that when one of my friends mentioned something about female swans, I scoffed and very loudly proclaimed that “you can’t have female swans”. I stuck by this, convinced they were fucking with me, until they realised I wasn’t kidding.

And that’s how I, at the age of 19, finally learned that female swans exist. My friends won’t stop laughing at me over it, and I really have no defence other than it made sense at the time.

TL;DR I didn’t think swans could be female, my friends won’t let me live it down."
9,"TIFU by diving into a pool headfirst, degloving my skull, and breaking my neck in 3 places.


As per usual this didn't happen today but this past Saturday. I (26f) was spending the day hanging out with friends by the pool, casually drinking and playing games. One of my friends decides to challenge me to a race to the other side of the pool. So we hop out and me, being the genius that I am, and very confident after being a competitive diver and swimmer for more than 10 years, decide to dive in from the shallow end. I go to take a running leap in and as I'm pushing off the deck, I feel my foot slip. I end up diving straight down, feel my neck crunch, and then blackout. I come to as I'm floating to the surface, back up, and tell my legs to just stand up cause I need to breath, but they don't respond. Most of my friends see me and think I'm joining, but very luckily my nurse and med school friend see blood and rocket into action. They stabilize my neck and flip me over in the water to breath and then get me up on the pool deck. In another incredible bout of luck, once I'm stabilized on the deck I can move my legs again. Friends call an ambulance (to which I am groggily and vehemently opposed to, thanks US healthcare prices) and once I get to the hospital I'm placed in the trauma ICU and CT scanned. I then find out I've pulverized my c2 and broken c1 and c3. And now I get bed rest and at least 3 months in a C collar. So yeah, don't dive in the shallow end folks! 

Tldr: dove in the shallow end, wrecked my neck like a hydraulic press"
10,"TIFU by not correcting my cashier when she mistook me for a coworker.


Today was my first day off work since Friday last week and I decided to run some errands. While I was out I ducked into a grocery store to buy a drink and noticed that the store’s EFTPOS was down. The cashier told me that they could still process the sale, I just had to sign for it and the money would be taken out once it came back online. 

On my drive home I realised that I had forgotten to pick up stuff for dinner so I swung into the grocery store closest to my place, which happened to be the same brand as the one earlier. I got my stuff with no problem and went to line up at the conveyer belt and this was where my fuckup began. 

I’m a person with anxiety so I always prepare something to say when I’m inevitably asked how my day is going. I knew that I was going to respond with “good, it’s been pretty busy although I had a sleep in this morning since I was at work so late last night”. I got up to the cashier and said hello, she looked at me in surprise and went “oh, are you not working today?” and I just panicked. This wasn’t what I had prepared for. So my stupid brain decided to go with what I had already prepared and I said “nah I was working late last night so I’m not in today.”

The second it came out of my mouth I wanted to hit myself. Why didn’t I just say that I didn’t work there? Sure I could correct her now, but I’m already in too deep. 

So we start talking about work. She complains about having a three hour shift and how it only works out as two and a half hours pay. For some reason I say that I’m lucky that I’m not working since it looks like it’s a busy day. She asks me if I’ve heard anything about Shaun leaving. I said that I heard he is. She was upset about that, he’s a nice guy. I agreed, he’s one of the good ones. I have no fucking clue who Shaun is. 

I manage to lie my way through the conversation, mentally berating myself but also congratulating myself on my tremendous acting skills. We get to the point where I’m about to pay and what do you know, the EFTPOS is down.  Part of my coping for anxiety is trying to make others as comfortable and happy as possible so instead of having her freak out over the system going down, I simply explain to her how to process the sale. Information I only know because I was at the other store two hours ago! 

She looks at me and goes, “well at least someone who works here knows what they’re doing.” I laugh nervously. Yeah...right. 

Then she asks me for my staff card to scan for “my” staff discount. And of course I don’t have a goddamned card. Who do you think I am, an employee? Luckily since I had only shoved my credit card into my phone case instead of bringing my whole purse I managed to come up with a lie about how I didn’t have my full purse so I don’t have my card. That’s alright though, she can put it through on hers and I can sign it. 

I signed a name that definitely wasn’t mine. Is that illegal? Probably not. I then picked up my bags and ran. Didn’t even say bye. I needed out of there. 

As I hurried away, I heard the guy on the register behind her turn around and go, “did you know her?”

I don’t think I can ever go back there. Either I’d have to attempt to keep up the pretence or go back and own up to it and face the shame. So I think I’ll take option three and avoid my neighbourhood grocery store like the plague. 

TL;DR: Cashier at my local grocery store mistook me for a coworker. Instead of correcting her my anxiety ridden brain decided to play along. I got in deep enough that I was teaching her to process sales. After she gave me her staff discount I fled the store and now don’t ever want to show my face again."
11,"TIFU by convincing my entire apartment building a velociraptor was on the loose


This FU happened about 6 years ago, but I still think about it to this day. 

I was a student studying at a big university that had some large, luxury apartment buildings nearby for students to live in after their freshman year. In my building, there were around 400 apartments across 8 floors. I lived in one of these apartments with three roommates. Modern gym, stainless steel appliances-- nice place. 

The FU starts with me not wanting to drink my face off for once on a Saturday and wake up the next morning feeling like a train wreck, and instead wanting to have a ""wholesome"" night of fun. So instead of going out, I decided to post signs around the building that a dinosaur, specifically a Velociraptor, was on the loose. Harmless, right?

I spent some time putting this [flyer](https://imgur.com/iGBTDIw) together, purposely making it ridiculous by adding phrases like ""look out for the Velociraptor mating call"" and ""ask security for repellent""-- I figured people would laugh about it. Then I walked down to the apartment building's lobby to use their free printing and make about a hundred copies. Finally, starting at about 9 PM, I spent the next two hours posting the sign on various doors around the building. 

For better or worse, it was a Saturday, and people were getting drunk. About halfway through my adventure, as I was getting into the elevator to change floors, I saw a girl dressed to go out, makeup done, on the phone with someone, tears streaking her mascara as she struggled to convey to someone that there ""had been a velola-raptor attack and that she didn't know what to do."" Me at the time thought this was really funny and kept going, and ultimately, after posting my hundred flyers, I went back to my apartment, watched some TV, and went to bed. That Sunday I spent most of my time doing homework and not leaving my room.

On Monday while in class my roommates' group text lit up with ""Does anyone know what [this](https://imgur.com/SnOsyEW) is? It was a pile of 4 ""Notice[s] of Lease Violation"" suggesting someone had caused a ""disturbance on the property"" and that there would be a fine. Me being fairly young, I got spooked, bounced from class, and biked to my apartment to take care of it.

I grabbed the notices and went to the leasing office. I'll shorten it immensely,  but the conversation can be summarized as such:

Me: ""Hi, I got these notices at my apartment today about causing a disturbance. I was wondering what it's about?""

Apartment Agent: ""Oh, so it's you."" Calls out to someone outside his office: ""Get in here ""Other Apartment Agent,"" it's the dinosaur boy!""

OAA, a guy trying too hard to be serious: ""Do you know what you did last night?""

Me: ""Yeah, I just posted some funny and clearly harmless signs around that there was a dinosaur on the loose. Also it was just me, so don't include my roommates here.""

OAA: ""Okay, just you, but it was neither funny nor harmless. Do you know how many calls security got? I had parents calling in demanding to know about the situation. We had students asking if there was a bunker to hide in.""

Me, a little bewildered: ""Uh, the sign said Velociraptor. Dinosaur. Clearly extinct. It was just a joke. How did people take that seriously?""

OAA: ""Look, *I know* Velociraptors have been dead for over 10,000 years, but you caused a disturbance, and I still have to fine you.

*10,000 years*. Fuck. There would be no winning with this guy. I asked him what the fine was ($100), ran back up to write a check, and paid it. (Note: They apparently knew it was someone in my apartment who posted the signs by following security footage).

To this day I wonder how many fully functioning adults at prestigious universities think Velociraptors are real, that they aren't dinosaurs but are instead a vicious reptile that people illicitly keep as pets or that you can go see at the zoo. I also occasionally wonder about the panic I caused, thinking about the girl who was likely on the phone with her parents, and all her parents probably heard were ""someone died -- on the loose -- don't know what to do."" 

I still laugh about it.

TL;DR: Posted signs around my building saying that a velociraptor killed someone and was on the run. Freaked out my drunk building and management got involved. Got fined $100."
12,"TIFU by shaving my legs


So I was in the shower shaving my legs. I was going quickly and carelessly, when I felt a sharp pain in my foot and noticed I had cut myself. Thinking it was nothing, I shouted for my sister to get a band-aid.

I WAS WRONG. SO, SO WRONG. The blood started gushing by the bucketload, and it wouldn't stop. The shower looked like a crime scene. My sister came in with the band-aid, took one look and rushed to get a medical kit.

Luckily, she has first-aid training and knew what to do. But there was so much blood. It spilled onto the floor when she asked me to come out and sit on the toilet lid so she could treat it, and I was naked too. Even though we're both girls, I still felt a bit uncomfortable.

She ended up spending half an hour just getting the blood to stop. The whole time I was trying not to panic. I'm prone to panic attacks, and this was freaking my the fuck out. Especially since the room now looked like someone had been murdered.

Eventually, the blood did stop, so she bandaged up my foot and we started to clean up the room. But of COURSE that's when my dad wanted HIS shower. We told him not to go in because blood, but he insisted he could clean up during his shower.

He must have underestimated the sheer volume of blood though, because he had a mini heart attack when he saw that room. He did keep his word and cleaned up, but he was stunned.

I later cleaned my razor and found a MASSIVE chunk of skin lodged in there. No wonder there was so much blood!

To add insult to injury, I hadn't shaved my other leg yet.

TL;DR I shaved my legs and cut myself. Needed half an hour to get the bleeding to stop. Dad wanted a shower before we could clean up."
13,"TIFU by not checking my fucking spam folder.


Obligatory *this didn't happen today* and all that stuff. TL;DR at the bottom blah blah blah.

So I'm a fucking idiot. 

I have a 'creative' email that I use for writing, in case anyone wants to contact me for commissions etc. Naturally, it's deader than my hopes and dreams, so I haven't actively opened it in a long time.

Today I was clearing out the 'ol ""spam"" folder in my main email, when I got the bright idea to take a look at my 'creative' inbox and see if there's anything there. Lo and behold, there is. Amidst all the 'Candy wants to chat to you!' and stupid shit like that, I found something that wasn't exactly spam.

A fucking reply to my book application.

Over a year ago I wrote and edited an entire fucking book, drafted up a cover letter and sent it out to all sorts of different publishing houses. About three months later I only got a reply from *one*, stating that it wasn't the kind of stuff they're looking for right now. Cool, I scrapped the book and took it as me just not writing the right stuff.

Turns out that another publishing house replied after about 4 months basically saying sweet, contact us regarding further detail and we'll make shit happen together.

That was a year ago. Thanks, Gmail, for ensuring only the important shit gets through. Wouldn't want those nasty publishing houses to scam me with a reply to my fucking email or something like that.

TL;DR: Gmail decided that a potential business venture was most likely a bot advertising cam services, sending it to 'spam' purgatory."
14,"TIFU by moving across the fucking planet


This is happening in real time. Complicated situation so apologies for the length.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm a 21 year old trying to get a career in banking. An opportunity came up for an unpaid internship in Singapore. I thought, who wouldn't want to spend a few months in Singapore? New alcohols, criminally cheap massages and Asian food.

The fuckup started when the time came to speak to someone. Leaving the airport I flagged a cab and spent about 5 minutes trying to communicate where my apartment was. It turns out Singaporeans speak 'English'. They know English but they speak it with such a heavy accent and so much slang its indecipherable to a piece of uncultured white trash like me. I've gotten really good at the smiling and nodding technique whenever someone questions me.

It turns out Singapore is ranked the most expensive city to live in the world (via Time Magazine) and there are no cheap massages. I spent the first week eating nothing but McDonalds (thank god the holy arches are all over in this damn world) until I found this little rice/noodle stand that will sell plates for a few bucks. The first day the old Chinese lady who mans the stand thought she could scam the dumb American but after 5 minutes of animated bargaining I got the price down. Way better than McDongholes.

The company I'm interning with apparently ran out of space in their main office so they plopped my ass in a dinky little satellite office. The first week I did some work on a project for them that apparently they didn't like because I have not heard from them for two weeks. I sent a few emails and texts to my contacts (who are at the main office) who just said there is a lot going on for them atm.

To make matters worse I found a friend from America a few days into the trip and we had been having a good time trying local bars out and attempting to flirt with local girls in the evenings. Well a few nights ago we had a bit much to drink and decided it would be a good idea to take a dip in the fountain outside our apartment. After a few minutes of fun, a patrol car flies up and a pair of officers jumps out yelling at us in what might have been English. I booked it without thinking, nothing but my sopping wet boxers. I tried calling my friend after the incident and legitimately have not heard from him for legitimately 3 days now.

So now I'm stuck on the other side of the fucking world, no idea what I'm doing here, no real job, the only source of sustenance is a chinese lady with a grudge and my only friend is presumably rotting in a Singaporean dungeon.

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR - I took an internship in Singapore, can't understand anyone, my company ghosted me, and my only friend was taken by the cops."
15,"TIFU by setting two of my friends up on a blind date


One of my friends (17M) was talked about how he wants a girlfriend again a few months ago. I was the patient listener, and very open when he asked if I knew any ""cute girls."" I thought it was a strange talk for us to have considering the fact that I disagree with his frequent encounters of the bedroom kind with various girls, but nevertheless I kept my eye out. Then about a month ago, one of my friends (17F) mentioned she had a massive crush on my friend. This was perfect! He's attractive, she's attractive, it totally worked on the superficial level. All I had to do now was to introduce them. The chatted over text (she doesn't have social media at the moment)and they met up two weeks later. I don't generally endorse the blind dating thing, but I hoped it would work out. The official date happened about 2 weeks ago. They went to a little restaurant around the corner from her high school. She texted me immediately after, saying it was great. They'd ordered food, walked around, and in typical behavior, he initiated and they made out. I just assumed everything went well. The next weekend, they hung out again. That is, until she called me afterwards crying. She told me that they'd been talking and she told him she thought the date was going well and he had replied with something along the lines of ""Ehhh, I don't know. I've had better."" laughed and then ""Because, lets face it, you are fucking disgusting. You're so ugly. I don't know why \_\_\_\_\_\_ paired us up, I mean, I'm leagues ahead of you. If I'm not getting any, it's not worth it. I'm not gonna fucking marry you."" and then left. I was so shocked, I thought she was kidding (spoiler alert: she wasn't) I texted him immediately and asked him what the hell he was doing. He told me that he didn't care how she felt because she should have know he was out of her league and he only wanted sex. and that he hated her eyes because ""it made her look asian"" I wasn't expecting it but it made me really angry and stupid for pairing them up in the first place. (of course I couldn't know how much of a racist dick he was because he's never acted like that before but still.)

I get that he is definitely the worst in this situation, but still. I paired them up and she's still upset about that

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR- I was a dumb teenager and paired two of my friends up on a date, the guy ended up being a misogynistic racist jerk"
16,"TIFU By letting my daughter keep pet snails.


So my sweet daughter loves bringing new “pets” into our house. Right now, she is really into snails, so I made a little snail habitat that she could keep her new found friends in. Well the other day she brought home some snails in a red solo cup and we forgot to put them in the snail habitat right away. The next morning I realize my mistake, put the snails from the cup into the little snail habitat and think nothing more of it! Yesterday I made some coffee. I have a French press, so I boil water in my teapot on the stove for my coffee. I Make my coffee, drink the whole French press of coffee and go about my day. Now here is where I realize I fucked up. This morning I was doing the dishes. I go to wash my teapot, dump the old water out, aaaannnnndd guess what comes out with the old water?! A mother fuckin’ boiled snail! That little bugger climbed into my teapot through the spout thinking it would be a good place to chill. Nope! He got boiled and I made my coffee with snail infused water. Drank the whole damn thing too. Moral of the story: Count the snails. Count the damn snails.

TL;DR Let my daughter bring in her pet snails. One escaped out of the cup she had it in and into my teapot I use to make my coffee. Boiled water for coffee, boiled the snail with out knowing. Drank snail infused coffee."
17,"TIFU by trying to remove my body hair


So this just happened 20 minutes ago and to be honest I’m still not sure if I’m okay so any doctors out there that might read this, lemme know!

So, every summer I usually do a Nair hair removal on my body, from like upper stomach to mid thigh. I’ve been doing it for a few years to achieve that smooth as a baby dolphin skin, so i know my skin is not sensitive or allergic to this product. 

Now, the Nair I buy comes with this [little white sponge.](https://imgur.com/a/juqaAMx) This helps basically “wash the hair away” by rubbing it off. I typically wash mine after every use. 

I recently went on a lake trip and I did my whole regime before I left. When I came back (as I was gone for quite some time) I noticed I missed a few spots and plus it was going to be date night soon so I figured *what the hell, I’ll do a bit more*

I was putting away my laundry after I came home, and found my sponge mixed in with my clothes. I set it aside, grabbed my clothes and lathered up with Nair. I waited my standard 5 or so minutes and hopped in the shower. Grabbed my sponge, and started rubbing. 

*oh my god*. At first, nothing was amiss. I’m rubbing, and the hair is coming off (in pretty good chunks but hey the product is working!). As I finish my front, I start to move to my backside. My literal backside. 

And then, it feels like I’m on fire. I go to wipe over a spot I already did and almost fall to my knees in pain. By now, I’ve almost finished my entire backside; back, lower butt and all. And it feels like my skin is eating itself. 

Let’s pause here and take a trip down my own TIFU memory lane. About 10 years ago, I was young and had a sick birthday party with awesome temporary tattoos that I put everywhere. I had forgotten about them until it was time to go to school Monday morning, and in a *holy shit everyone is going to make fun of me for having a pirate temporary tattoo on my cheek* induced moment, I grabbed the Mr.Clean Magic Eraser from under our kitchen sink and scrubbed my face as vigorously as possible. 

Now for those who don’t know what a Mr. Clean Magic Eraser is, lets just say it’s a small white sponge that packs the power of all the Greek Gods in it to remove any stain on any surface. I thought it would be a great move to scrub my skin with it, and boy was I wrong. The skin around my cheek melted off in some sort of disgusting science experiment and scabbed, leaving everyone to call me “zombie girl” for weeks. Safe to say, I am traumatized and know *exactly* what that sensation feels like. 

Okay, back to the present. So here I am, skin burning and glaring red. I finish my shower, change into the loosest clothes I own, and lay down to cry. As I’m in bed, my grandfather comes over and says “hey, I cleaned the bathroom and threw my magic erasers in with your laundry. Did you find them when you put away your clothes?” 

And that my friends, is the moment I had a flashback of my zombie face trauma, and knew I had made the biggest FU of my life, twice

And of course, here’s the [proof on my body. ](https://imgur.com/a/T0zSFdF)

TLDR; Used a magic eraser to take off my hair removing product. Gave myself ptsd as I have done this before, and now I have chemical burns all over my body."
18,"TIFU by blowing my nose to hard , opening the elevators from the shinning , and having to get my nose cauterized.


I woke up today and it was like any other day so i thought.  As I disembark from the dream train and stumble into the bathroom to deal with my morning routine I notice my nose felt full.  I got excited because who doesn't like breaching the booger dam and firing boogers out like a rail gun.  

I blew gloriously and felt the sweet release of said booger dam. It was like buck shot into a tissue.  As soon as i did this i knew something was a miss. 

I got that odd feeling you get with a bloody nose.  Dripping but not quite snot, it was more fluid. I touched my nose with the tissue and realized it was soaked. We're not talking little drips of blood but full on red as can be.  I grab a tissue and move the old one to apply the fresh sponge , immediately it was pouring a rain of blood in my sink.  

As i hold a new tissue i start to realize I can't breath and my throat is getting full .. I spit in the sink and a golf ball sized glob of coagulated spit blood hits the sink like one of those sticky hands you get from the dollar machines.  

I went to the hospital and spent an hour with a close pin device on my nose until a doctor could see me. 

He takes his nose scope and tells me i have a busted vein and we are going to cauterize it.  

""Ummm like as in burn the inside of my nose to sear the vein closed ?"" 

He walks in with a stick and tells me to hold his light.  I hold it and he goes spelunking poking around , and it immediately starts to burn like i poored hot sauce in my nose.  

Now i can't blow my nose for 3 weeks and it's cemented shut from dried blood.  Im uncomfortable.

TL;DR

I blew my nose to hard and had to get a doctor to cauterize the wound,  my bathroom now looks like a murder scene"
19,"TIFU by telling a random dude we've been watching him for years UPDATE!


If you didn't see my first post, it is right [here] (https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/cba007/tifu_by_telling_a_dude_weve_been_watching_him_for/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share)

Today I told my mom about my previous post, made her read it, made her almost cease to exist from laughing so hard and then she says ""Yeah, but that guy is pretty weird."" And I say ""Uhh why do you say that?"" and APPARENTLY I am from a family of freakishly awkward individuals. You guys, my dad DID THE SAME SHIT AS ME and he just... forgot to tell me or my sister about it? (Thanks Dad, you're great.)
So he runs into My Dude at the store and he was like ""oh hey, I see you running all the time! You're looking great! Keep it up!"" My dad was a coach, so he's got the weird proud dad thing going on. My Dude just kind of looks at him...says ""th-ankssss."" And slowly backs away. 
The End.
JUST KIDDING. Then my mom proceeds to tell me she just saw My Dude running. 
Please read the following in stereotypical mom voice: ""Oh my gosh, I saw him running the other day. His shoes look so bad! I almost stopped. I wish I knew his shoe size so I could get him new shoes! Should I stop and ask him?"" Holy.Shit. 
(Don't worry, I said don't fucking do that mom Jesus Christ fuckin' figure it out.)
So now that I know I wasn't the first person to tell him that I've been watching him I feel REALLY bad. My family ladies and gentlemen.

Tl;Dr
My whole family is awkward AF and told s guy we've been watching him run on separate occasions."
20,"TIFU by trusting my co workers with money.


I’m a bartender. I’ve been working with the same people for a couple of years now (the two people I’m about to talk about got hired at the beginning of this bar opening with me.)
Like i said, it’s been about two years. These two girls have been an incredibly HUGE part of my life ever since. We have pretty much been inseparable since we became friends during opening.

Today, I worked a double. I opened, and it’s summer break (we are a bar arcade) and so I didn’t get to stock everything I needed to to prepare night shift. At 5:00, when my night shifters got to work, instead of taking a break, I took that time to finish the things I couldn’t to prepare night shift fully. And then instead of taking a break after that, I went ahead and got back behind the bar and started working because they were busy, and I couldn’t leave them in the weeds.

To finish up, we got our asses kicked, after my 12 straight hour shift with no break, I finally was cut, so I did my side work, and before I was ready to clock out, I went to our till, ready to do the three way split (since the way we do things, we just take the entire place and split it), and a bunch of credit card tips were missing.

To summarize, my co workers had tried to hide over $150 in credit card tips to try and not split with me. And I am so fucking upset, my heart felt like it could explode, and I’m pretty sure I just lost my best friends, but also, fuck both of them.

TL;DR, My bartenders/best friends/co workers tried to steal over $150 from me after I worked a 12 hour shift today and I’m fucking upset about it."
21,"TIFU by taking letting my 9 month old daughter play with my headphones


Ok so this actually happened today and I’m still a little shook up but I thought, why not post to reddit. 

So my wife is on a training course for the next few days so I am the chief baby sitter (she loves it when I say that) 

This morning, I was playing with my daughter and she was messing around with my iPhone headphones, you know the type that go in your ear? And don’t have the little rubber tips? Them ones. Lovely and safe of course. This is when the main fuck up happens... I hear a strange rubbery noise coming from her mouth, so I put my finger in and she’s chewing one of the rubber bits! ‘Oh shit, this is not safe for a 9 month old’ I think. I take it out her mouth and suddenly realise... those aren’t my headphones! They are my wife’s shitty Samsung ones! 

I check out the other tip... it’s missing. I look at my daughter and see her smiling there, knowing full well she’d swallowed it. Oh shit. I google it, and I’m not sure if you’ve ever googled anything health related, but if you have a headache, basically you’ve got brain cancer. If your baby has swallowed some rubber, she needs an X Ray. This is also backed up with the fact she is coughing a little, a classic symptom of the rubber swallowed death syndrome I just googled. 

In my panicked state, I think the best thing is go to A&amp;E. For context, I’m in the UK so I know they aren’t going to charge me £100million for an X Ray, so I think fuck it I’m going.

I don’t live far from the local hospital, so I walk across. I speak to the receptionist who is basically telling me it will be ok, but they will check it out anyway. 

Long story short, they said don’t worry about it but keep an eye on her. I walk home worried the whole way, and walk through my door... and straight away see the other little rubber tip on the floor. She hadn’t even swallowed it, she’d just taken it off and thrown it across the room. The little shit even had the audacity to try to pick it up and eat it again. 

TLDR: baby doesn’t swallow ear tip even though I thought she did. I go to the A&amp;E and look a twat."
