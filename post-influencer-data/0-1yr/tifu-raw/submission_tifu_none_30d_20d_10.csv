0,"TIFU by genuinely forgetting I had a joint in my pocket and trying to board a plane in Amsterdam and getting caught.


So this literally just happened 30 mins ago. 

I would freely and happily admit if I tried this on purpose as a warning to others, but legitimately fucked up here. 

Came with a couple of friends for the weekend to Amsterdam for a birthday. It’s a great city, pretty to look at and loads of fun. 

I’m sure most people know the Dutch have decriminalised the use of weed and you can visit ‘coffee shops’ and buy and smoke joints. 

Had a fun party night last night in town. Went to some coffee shops, got stoned, went to some bars, danced at a club. Had a great night, but only a couple of hours sleep. 

In a rush packing this morning, as slept through alarm, I put on last nights jeans on with a joint in plastic tube in pocket (front weird pocket in front of main pocket) left over from last night. Got to airport in reasonable time considering slept through alarm. Rushed towards security when suddenly this hideous sensation of my stomach dropping like in a falling lift...’did I ditch that joint’?

At this stage my rucksack is going through the scanner and the airport staff are guiding me through a body scanner tube that you stand still in with your hands in the air, whilst something revolves around you. 

‘Sir, do you have anything in your pockets’ says the customs lady as she steers me towards the body scanner. 

Holy. Fucking. Shit. What to do? I’m still not 100% at this point if there was a joint in my pocket or not. Do I come clean? No way-too late for that. Got to try and style this out, as pocket might actually not have anything in it. 

Go to tube, put hands up, get scanned no problem. But, Schiphol Airport as policy, possibly because of weed, frisk everyone as soon as out of scan tube. I’m asked to put my hands in air again as airport guy starts to frisk intensely all over. I’m sweating bullets and my scrambled mind is trying to remember the hazy details of last nights outing-did I smoke that joint??? Airport guys hands pats pocket. I feel object being pressed into hip. FUCK FUCK FUCK. 

‘Sir, empty your pocket please’? Says airport guy. My partner in the mean time has passed security and is watching on. In slow motion I see the penny drop on his face. I dig into that weird front mini pocket, and pull out a small joint in a plastic tube (as sold in coffee shops) of my pocket. Audible gasps come out of other passengers in queue behind me. I feel my face turning almighty red and feel the room getting a bit spinny. 

I’m dying inside. I say to pat down guy, ‘oh god. I’m really sorry, I forgot that was in th...’
‘HAHA, SURE, SURE - THATS WHAT THEY ALL SAY’! Laughs airport pat down guy loudly. 

I’m placed to one side. Customs security is called over (was left a nerve shredding 30 mins before he turned up). Just gonna take this moment and opportunity to say-the Dutch are a fucking fabulous bunch of people. 

Customs man comes over and takes one look at me quivering/near to tears and says, ‘Don’t worry Sir! Don’t look so scared! You are 20th today and you won’t be last! I’m sorry you have a government at home that is so restrictive, but unfortunately I can’t let you leave Amsterdam with this joint as you will get in trouble at home’. 

I almost wept with relief. I was made to sign a form to say he’d taken joints off me....and that was it...

I’m in a bar in Schiphol Airport in Amsterdam having a drink to steady my nerves. To all you Dutch-bless your hearts. You’re the best. I’m sorry I was a hot mess and added to the problem of being a dumb fucking tourist.

TLDR I was a hot mess and genuinely forgot I had a joint in my pocket. Dutch customs were amazing."
1,"TIFU by delivering for Door Dash


So I’ve been delivering for dash dash on the side for a few weeks now. Today I had a typical order from a local sushi joint. I saw the order for a fellow named Tom...funny thing the second half of the order is EXACTLY TO THE TEE what my gf ALWAYS gets. Two dragon rolls extra Siracha on the side and a large Ice Tee. She is very particular! She also has a co-worker named Tom she has mentioned AND she said she spent the night up in Denver with her sister last night for a girls night. Hmmmmmm....Picked up the order and was on my way. Pulled up to a waaaaaay nice apartments knocked on the door and a very handsome fellow named Tom answered. Handed him the food and heard a familiar voice say “Make sure there’s  Siracha!” It was my now ex gf in a T-Shirt and panties. I said nothing she said nothing... door closed and well now I’m single! And onto me next Dash better make that money if I’m going to be back on Tinder. TLDR delivered a Door Dash to my now ex gf while she was cheating on me with her coworker. Tall Handsome man with a nice ass apartment."
2,"TIFU by falling asleep in the back of my boyfriend's car


Last summer. We're on a road trip from New Mexico to Mexico. We have a Honda Element converted for living in, so I crawl in the back to nap while he's driving. He stops at a gas station in the desert of Arizona and while he's pumping, I get out to use the bathroom. Come back out, don't see him, and walk around the parking lot to have a look. I jokingly think to myself that maybe he drove off not knowing that i got out to use the restroom, but brush that off. I sit on a bench outside twiddling my thumbs, realizing this may now actually be the case. I reach for my phone to call him, but of course my phone is in the car.

I go back inside to ask the cashier to use their phone, but she says they don't have one. Obviously they do, but whatever. So I start asking random people in the store to use their phone, which makes people visibly uncomfortable because we're in the middle of nowhere and they think I'll steal it I guess. I go back outside and continue asking strangers for their phone. I realize I don't know my boyfriends number by heart so I just call my phone repeatedly, hoping he'll answer. He doesn't. I use one person's phone to log into my facebook to find my boyfriend's number, but alas, his phone is dead when I call.

I resort to explaining to everyone whose phone I ask to use my situation. Some don't believe me, others feel really bad, and one man offered to buy me a hotel room for the night in the next town over thinking that my boyfriend left me on purpose and I was just being modest. It's been about 2 hours now. The store clerks through the windows have been looking at me suspiciously for a while, I'm still sitting on this bench in the desert, and have no idea what to do and start bawling my eyes out.

A cop car pulls up and the officer comes to me and lets me know the store clerks called them because ive been loitering, haggling people for phones outside of their store and crying. I explain my situation and shes as confused and sympathetic as all the other people. She tells me I can't stay there so she can either take me to a truck rest stop in the town over or go to the police station. I ask her to take me to the rest stop, although shes not convinced that my boyfriend legitimately left me there on accident. We're driving down the highway when on her radio another cop says he's at the gas station and there's a guy there looking for his girlfriend. I just crack up and she does too, flips the car around and takes me back. And there my boyfriend is standing outside of his car, banging on the windows and nearly crying because he couldn't believe he'd actually done that. 

He said he was passing some really cool scenery far into the drive and went to wake me up to see too when he realized I wasn't in the car, flipped it around and drove faster than he's ever driven in his life to get back to the gas station. And that he wondered why so many people kept calling me, but didnt feel comfortable answering my phone. He thought for sure that was the end of our relationship and the trip was ruined. 

TLDR: went to use the bathroom while my boyfriend was pumping gas, he didn't know, drove off, and I was stranded, asking people to use their phones for hours until police were called to come get me."
3,"TIFU by c*mming so hard I fainted


So this happened a couple of days ago..

Had a rash develop over the past few weeks and it was itching like crazy, thought at first it was just some kind of allergy from switching body washes lately. After changing back to my old wash and my rash didn't showing any indication of subsiding, I went to visit a dermatologist. Anyways, turns out I have a skin condition called Pityriasis rosea, which isn't actually serious and should go away on its own. So she perscribed me some corticosteroids for the itching and sent me on my way home. Anyone that has ever gotten an itch knows that there are few things more pleasant than scratching it. After showering (and before taking my medication), the rash was itching particularly strongly and I sat down on the toilet to dry my hair. I noticed that when the hot air from the dryer came in contact with my rash ( Rash was spread all over the back) it felt like scartching my back REAALLLYYY good. So naturally I took the hot dryer closer to my skin and voila, that shit felt close to an orgasm. Naturaly I decided to take it to the next logical level: Flopping the bishop while scratching my rash with the hot hair dryer (Yes I know this sounds mildy retarded). What ensued next was the most transending experience in my whole fucking life. I busted a nut so hard I started to see stars, my hole body started to tremble and I fucking fainted. My parents heard the thump of me falling on the floor from downstairs, and appearantly called for me a few times, my mother is a REAAAL worrier, so my dad broke down the bathroom door, where they found me laying like literally covered in a quarter cups worth of semen, my back all red from the hot air, and the hairdryer blowing at max speed all over the place. So yeah, my mother hasn't looked me in the eye for like 2 days. FML

TL;DR: Found out hot air from hairdryer works 50 times better than scratching with nails, decided I wanted to scratch and masturbate at the same time. Came so hard I went to narnia and back, fainted so hard on the toilet seat my dad had to tear down the bathroom door.

I'm legit thinking of going living in the woods. lol"
4,"TIFU I hooked up with a guy in my airport hotel room this morning before checking out. Turns out he is on the same flight as me and guess what, he’s traveling with his wife and kids.


I know Reddit is going to give me a lot of hate for this. This morning I was super horny and really wanted hook up with a local guy to give him bj. So I got to talking with a guy and even though he was a lot older (like late 30s-mid 40s), he had a great bod and a great dick. So I said what the hell and invited him to my hotel room. After 45min to an hour of fun, I thought I’d never see this dude again because I’m flying home this afternoon (right now).

Wrong. I went to the gate when they started boarding. Guess who was pre-boarding with his wife and children? You guessed it. To make matters worse, they are just a couple rows from me and I can hear all their conversations. I’m in the plane right now and he keeps texting. I am saving screen shots in case I need them in the future. I’m sitting here wondering how he was able to get away from his family that long...he was staying at the same hotel, which now just dawned on me because he made it to my room super fast. 

This is so uncomfortable.

TL;DR: Hooked up with a guy at my airport hotel this am. Turns out he’s married, and he and his family are on my flight home."
5,"TIFU by going to bed drunk.


So last night I went out as I do every Saturday.
When I got there I met up with my friends and started the night with a couple of beers, but ended the night with a bit more than I could handle. After that I went straight home and instantly fell asleep on the couch as I was trying to lay down on it ""just to rest for a moment"".

I woke up around 5 today and my right arm felt a bit weird. It was cold and I couldn't move it at all.
At first I didn't panick at all because this has happened to me before because I sometimes sleep with my arm under my head. However today I slept with my arm under the side of my body ( I got a little over 100kg/220 lbs) with my back against the back-rest of the couch. After about 20 minutes of relaxing and massaging the arm with no to little signs of improvement I woke up my parents and after I explained my situation, my mom (who is a doctor) suggested we go to the hospital immediately.

During my 2 hour stay at the hospital the arm became significantly better as the time went on.
However my fingers and my wrist (not nearly as much as fingers but it still felt a bit off) movement were problematic. After getting some tests done on the arm nerves (which I hope I never do again) I waited for the results. A little over an over passes and the doctor came back with the results. 

It appears that I have done damage to a nerve with my hip while I was asleep and will most likely never be able to fully contract my right hand (I'm right handed) fingers . At first the doctor didn't know how I managed to fall asleep in such an uncomfortable position, but after I told him what I have done the night before he told me that it is a common thing, but that it usually doesn't end up this badly.

Now I'm sitting at home writing this one-handed on my phone contemplating life just because of two beers too much.

TL;DR: Drunkenly feel asleep in a bad position and permanently damaged my arm nerves."
6,"TIFU by saying the worst possible thing in a restaurant


This happened a few hours ago in a busy buffet restaurant in a hotel in Austria.

Being a buffet restaurant, people were pretty much always wandering from table to food and back again, so there was a constant steam of mainly Austrian and German people passing our table. We’ve been here a few days, you start to recognise people and my two young sons have made a few friends.

I was joking with the kids  that I’d left their Nintendo Switch at home, they suspected I was joking but went along with it anyway. So when I told them I had brought it they wanted to check.

“I brought it,” I said 

“Our Switch?”

“Yes, Our Switch”

“What?!! OUR Switch?!”

“Yes!! OUR Switch!!”

They got louder and we started just repeating it, laughing. I noticed my wife frowning at me, or past me, it didn’t really register.

“OUR SWITCH?”

“OUR SWITCH! Ha!”

Then my wife really started signalling to me to shut up - I was like “it’s ok... it’s a buffet”

“OUR SWITCH! Ha!”

“OUR SWITCH!”

Then my wife leaned in and urgently whispered “it sounds like you are all shouting Auschwitz”

My whole body went cold with the realisation.

Needless to say I immediately stopped, placed my hand on my eldest son’s knee and he - seeing the look on my face-  stopped straight away - the 3 year old did one final shout before I could stop him... 

I have avoided eye contact with all other hotel guests since. 

TLDR: Shouted “Auschwitz” loudly, happily, repeatedly,  in a restaurant full of Germans and Austrians. I’m really sorry."
7,"TIFU by basically buying a serial killer starter kit at my local hardware store...


This happened earlier today and I'm pretty sure I'm on a police watch list now.

Needed to pick up a few things from my local hardware store I was running low on that I like to have around. Zip ties, duck tape, and things for quick repairs. 

While I was there I noticed they were having a store wide sale. I'm an avid outdoorsmen and with hunting season coming up I like to keep certain back up items in my truck if I need them. I figured I would grab some things while they are on sale.

Walking through the isles I start randomly grabbing items I think I might need for my kit. Such as a tarp, some rope, large knife, headlamp, latex gloves, and a lantern with extra batteries.

Keep in mind I already have zip ties and duct tape in my cart when I walk up to the register. These are things I generally purchase, buy never all at once.

Girl at the register greets me as I start placing items on the counter. I give her my number for rewards points and she quickly starts scanning things.

About half way through she slows down a bit. She looks down at my already bagged items, at the stuff left on the counter, and then back to me. I'm just standing there waiting with my wallet in hand, clueless as to what is now processing in her head.

Then we have a light convo that in hindsight prob made things worse:

Her: ""Wow that's a big knife.""
Me: ""Yeah I like having cheap, throwaway knives around. Same with tarps and stuff too.""
Stares at me funny after my reply as she scans knife.

Her: ""Can I see your ID to verify your at least 18 to purchase this.""
Me being 30, going bald, and grey in my beard looks at her weird as I've never been asked for my ID here. Pull it out and hand it to her. 

She quickly looks at my ID info and then glances up at her screen where I noticed my reward info was pulled up. Didn't think anything of it at the time.

She says thanks, hands it back while still looking at it, and finishes scanning my items. Almost looking like she was taking inventory of what I had.

She gives me my total and I hand her some cash (prob another red flag, no paper trail.)

I get my change, grab my bags, and head for the door. She yells back don't forget your receipt as she walks it over to me. I grab it as I notice her quickly glance up at the security camera in front of the door.
I say thanks and leave thinking that whole situation was weird.

I get home and start unpacking my bags to sort stuff out on my kitchen table when my wife comes up behind me. She glances at my items and jokingly asks if she should be worried.

I was like what? Still clueless. Before she points out that it looks like I'm about to go tie someone up and murder them.

Girl at register must have thought the same thing. Checked my info and I'm pretty sure made sure she got my face on the security camera in case someone pops up murdered on the news later.

Told my wife about cashier and she about died laughing at me for being so clueless.

TLDR: 
Bought zip ties, duct tape, knife, tarp, rope, and other questionable items randomly for hunting season on sale at my local hardware store. Pretty sure cashier thought I was a serial killer."
8,"TIFU by forgetting my weed butter in the fridge while my parents staying in my flat


It all happened this morning.

I´m a student  in Cologne, Germany.My parents visited me over the weekend and stayed in my own flat.Yesterday evening we went out to get some drinks and celebrate my successful second semester.My dad and me were pretty drunk, so we went home and fell into bed.Next morning my lovely mom made some breakfast for us, while we were still asleep.She woke us up with some coffee so we sat down in the kitchen.I couldn't eat anything cause my hangover was pretty bad.So my mom and dad started eating some scrambled eggs and some Wurstbrot (sausage sandwich).After a few minutes I started eating too. I took my first bite of the bread and recognized/tasted  what just happened.I had made some weed butter with some friends a while ago to bake some cookies.We made way to much of it so I kept the rest inside a plastic box in my fridge.Yeah.. so I took my first bite and realised that my mom took this butter to cook the scrambled eggs and even used it for the Wurstbrot.I was shocked and felt like frozen. I didn't know how to explain or even what to do from there on.My mom noticed my reaction and asked if everything is all right.I asked her which butter she used and she told me that she used the one which was already opened in the box.So I started carefully to explain what just happened before the weed may kick in without them knowing what is going on.My mom started to panic, cause she never done drugs and has completely no relationship to weed. For her its a real, hard drug.My dads reaction was pretty chill. He started laughing and tried to calm down my mom, cause he was smoking pot in his youth too.An hour later after my dad could relax my mom a bit, she felt asleep while my dad got pretty high. He started talking a lot about his time as a teenager and told me stories about some of his trips in and to Amsterdam. I am pretty glad my dad reacted that cool! Cause my mom isn't fine with it at all.As soon as my mom woke up the drama began again. She is still pretty angry at me and is disappointed cause she thought I would never do drugs.My dad told me she would calm down soon.They drove home a few hours ago.I think I never felt that weird and kind of helpless as today. Its hard to describe how it felt... awkward for sure!

TLDR: My mom took my weed butter without knowing and made breakfast with it. My dad got high while my mom was groundbreaking disappointed and fell asleep."
9,"TIFU by going for a walk and accidentally traumatising a woman for life


Obligatory “happened a few years ago etc” but basically there was this walking/bike path near my house that I would occasionally walk along for exercise.

Sometimes, while walking, I’d set myself a personal goal, like “reach that pole by the end of this song” or whatever (I listened to music while I walked).

Well, one time I saw someone walking in front of me. They were a considerable distance ahead of me, but I decided that my goal that night was to overtake them by the time I reached my turnaround point.

So I started walking faster to catch up and overtake them, and realised it was a woman. At the time I didn’t think anything of it, because, hey, we’re both on the same walking path for the same reason; getting healthy.

As I slowly yet surely got closer to her, I noticed she would occasionally turn her head and look behind her. I’d had a couple close calls with people riding bikes along the path (my fault, I only really owned dark colours), so whenever she looked behind her, I’d turn around and look behind me, because I thought she may have heard a bike bell that I hadn’t heard over my music. Meanwhile I kept my speed up because I was on pace to beat her in our race to my turnaround point.

Near to my turnaround point it gets quite dark, because trees hang over the path; and it’s of course here that I finally catch up with her..

As I get within two metres of her, she suddenly spins around and enters into what I can only describe as a karate/taekwondo attack position (legs braced and arms ready). Aimed directly at me.

I immediately realise what I’ve done (wearing dark colours, looking behind me when she did, powerwalking towards her).
I gave her the most awkward smile in the world while I powerwalked past her, walked WAYY past my turnaround point so I could avoid her on the way back, and seriously considered powerwalking myself off the nearest cliff.

As an added “bonus”, I later learned that there was a notorious rapist named “the bike path rapist” that operated in that specific area of the bike path a few years prior.

TL;DR Decided to race a stranger without their knowledge, awkwardly followed them, caught up to them in the darkest section of the path, nearly got Bruce Lee’d, awkwardly smiled and powerwalked away."
10,"TIFU by trying to remember what a customer looked like


The time has come. I’ve made it. I’m writing this from the break room shaking and humiliated. Not only did this FU happen today, it happened within the last hour. I don't see my therapist again until Thursday, so you get to hear about it instead.

I work in a customer-facing position in a small office. Today’s just a regular Monday. Talking to customers, preparing their work orders, finishing their paperwork, all sorts of small stuff. At time being, I have three customers sitting in my waiting area.

The most recent addition to our quiet morning waiting room, we’ll call her Jan, has been here before. Or rather, her family has a customer history with us - it’s my first time meeting her. The name on their account is Hank Junts and I feel like I’ve met him before. I *know* that I've met him before. I browse through their history and they have extensive records, but for the life of me I cannot place his face.

After about ten minutes of idle clicking, I decide to search his name on Google with the name of our city.

“Beloved Softball Coach Hank Junts passes away in tragic fire.” Headline from a local news station.

*Oh my god. Maybe that’s why I’ve never met her before. Maybe he always came in instead of her. *

The article is dated December of last year.

*Jeeze, it probably has been that long since I've seen him, hasn’t it. Oh how tragic.* Jan is probably only in her 40s or so. 

I wonder if I should say anything.

But I don’t have to say anything. I would credit Satan with the creation of auto-play videos on news articles, but Satan never did anything so heinous.

**In tragic news, Hank Junts, softball coach at Smith Middle School, passed away as a result of a house fire last night.**

At full volume - echoing through the small room like a bird that got trapped inside, bouncing and flitting around uncatchable. I cannot catch it. The bird has knocked a vase onto Mrs. Junts’ head. The bird has knocked me on my ass. There is a bird in my throat and it feels like my mouth is full of feathers.

*oh my god oh my god oh my god.*

**no no no.**

I frantically scroll trying to find the video player. Fuck. Found it. Pause pause pause pause pause you piece of shit.

*Oh yeah, that’s what he looks like. *

Jan looks up at me. I look up at Jan. The Earth crackles and groans as the floor beneath me opens and swallows me whole.

No, I’m not that lucky. I stammer something about being so sorry for her loss and run to the break room, where I now sit red-faced and horrified. I can hear her on her cell phone. She is crying. I am crying. I fucked up and just ruined my customer's day and have a new addition to the file of Horrible Things To Think About Right As I Fall Asleep.

tldr: Couldn’t remember what a customer looked like, wound up with a news clip loudly autoplaying how the customer died in a house fire - and I played it all of ten feet from his widow."
11,"TIFU by accidentally taking my boyfriend on his nightmare date.


Full disclosure, this happened several years ago (and he is now my ex boyfriend), but something made me remember this story today.

My ex-boyfriend was a big fun of grand gestures and surprise dates. He took me to all kinds of cool stuff to surprise me, like an O-bon Festival, a Star Trek movie showing, an art museum, even a surprise interstate road trip on my birthday! For his birthday, I resolved to pay him back with his own nice surprise. We had been together for ~10 months at that point, so I thought I knew what would suit him: a picnic at a beautiful outdoor conservatory, a walk around the zoo, and the surprise: tickets to a butterfly conservatory, basically a glass dome filled with lush greenery, flowers, and butterflies as far as the eye can see. 

I had always gone to the butterfly house with my family and loved it soooooo much. It was special to me and I was so excited to share it with him. 

He was having a great time walking around with me by the lakes and at the picnic. I kept hyping him up, saying ""I can't wait until the final surprise, I hope you love it! You're going to love it!"" 

We got to the entrance, they tore our tickets, and I led him in Belle-at-the-library-in-Beauty-&amp;-the-Beast style. I still won't shut up, trying to get him hyped. Finally, the moment of truth: I took my hands off his eyes and watched him behold the kaleidoscopic beauty surrounding him. 

Immediately, his face blanched and he looked like someone had just punched him in the stomach. 

He was cowering and clinging to my arm when a butterfly flew past him. 

""Umm... are you OK, dear?""

""I'm.... fine..."" he said with a classic Hide the Pain Harold grimace. 

""You don't seem fine. Did something happen?"" 

""You're right. I'm not fine. Why would people pay money for a bunch of fucking bugs to fly at them?"" 

I must have looked hurt because he grabbed my arm and said, ""we can stay, you just have to stay close to me."" 

Before I could even say ""of course"" he shouted ""OH GOD IT'S IN YOUR HAIR! IT'S IN YOUR HAIR!"" And yanked away from me. I spun around and he had run back out the exit with employees running after him, shouting that they had to check his body for stowaway butterflies. Little kids with their families were staring wide-eyed. Some of them started to scream and cry. 

By the time I had caught up with him, he had thrown up in the trash bin by the duck pond. 

He apologized for making a scene and said he had a phobia of moths that had simply not yet come up in conversation. 

We just kind of looked at the pond awhile and he said, ""well, let's just go home."" 

I apologized profusely and it was like another 6 months before I had the courage to plan another surprise for him, which surprise surprise, I also fucked up. 

Tldr; I unintentionally traumatized my moth-phobic now-ex-boyfriend by enclosing him in a space with hundreds of butterflies"
12,"TIFU by getting Hulk Hogan stuck to my foreskin


Even though this happened over a decade ago, my family still occasionally roasts me for it.

Back when I was around 9 or 10 my family bought me [these toys for Christmas](https://m.imgur.com/a/AD358JS). As the pictures suggests, you could “connect” a figure's fists to anothers via the magnets on the fists themselves - which happened to be **really** strong.

You can probably see where this is going already... In my not-so-clever mind I wanted to see if I could connect the wrestlers to my foreskin. I remember stretching my foreskin with one hand whilst also holding one of the wrestlers fists against the stretched skin. Then with my other hand I grabbed the other wrestler and slowly brought its fist closer to the foreskin where the other fist was sitting on the other side. **SNAP** I fell over and screamed in agonising pain, as not only were Hulk Hogan and Goldberg stuck to my foreskin - they were pinching the end like a snapping turtle. 

Hulk and Goldberg held their grip while I screamed in pain. I tried pulling them apart but due to the pain or panick I just couldn't.

To my absolute embarrassment, my Mum and Dad rushed into the room and had to pull Hulk and Goldberg from my dick.

This story is still brought up at Christmas dinners to this day.

TL;DR: Got Hulk Hogan and Goldberg action figures stuck to my dick via magnets and had to get my parents to remove them."
13,"TIFU by helping a friend


A friend knocked on my door today. I don't know him too well, he's the father of one of my son's friends. He seemed quite urgent, so I let him in. He asked if I had a scanner, as he needed something scanned and emailed to him straight away. I sure did!

I invited him into my office. Placed the first page into the scanner. Sat down. Opened my graphics software, and declared ""It's easy! Watch!"".

Unfortunately the software displayed the last image I was working on; a close-up of my erect penis.

It was a decent photo actually. Great lighting. Good composition. A nice angle, too! I don't HAVE many of those pics, I just took one recently as someone asked for it, and uncharacteristically, I felt like obliging.

Two thoughts went through my head;

1. CLOSE IT (which I did)
2. Will he think I've been checking out dick pics, and that I'm gay?!

Now, #2 is not an issue. I am not, and I don't care if anyone thinks I am. However... recently he's been inviting me to a lot of kids' events, and asking questions like ""are you dating?"", ""what do you think of Helen?"" (name changed for privacy reasons). So I've been wondering if HE is that way inclined, and perhaps had his eyes on me....

So... I then compounded things.

To stop him thinking that I'd been looking a close-up pics of other men's penises.. I confidently said ""That was me!"".

He looked around, said ""I think someone called me"", and left.

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR accidentally showed a neighbour a close-up photo of my erect penis, then proudly said ""that was me!"""
14,"TIFU by accidentally selling my boudoir photo shoot to a drunk pervert


This happened a few months ago. Sold our entire bedroom set because we were getting a new one to a nice man in his 60s. He picked up, paid, and all was well. 

A few hours later he messaged me on Facebook asking if the pictures were of me. Holy shit, I’d forgotten to clean everything out of the nightstand, which still contained a boudoir photo shoot I’d given my husband for our wedding. 

Hella embarrassed, I explained what he’d found and that I would be willing to meet him to pick up the album. Except now he starts being a creepy asshole and sending wink faces and saying he wants to keep it. The back and forth angry messaging was doing no good. He stopped responding after I threatened to get the cops involved. 

So I call the cops and they say there’s not really anything they can do unless he starts actively harassing me; as I sold him the nightstand with the photos in it, they were technically his property. Eventually an officer went to his house as a courtesy to me and asked if he’d be willing to return the pictures, which he did. The officer drove to my place and returned them, saying the man was quite drunk and upset that I’d sent the police over. 

TL;DR: I sold a nightstand to an old drunk pervert with my semi-nudes still inside it and things got awkward. The police were called."
15,"TIFU by accidentally causing my mum's DMs to flood with dick pics


This one actually happened today. So basically my mum runs a language school online. My part in this business is to manage the social media side, sort out advertising etc... Anyways today I thought it would be a good idea to post a few ads on some language related Facebook groups as the new academic year is soon approaching and people are starting to look for tutors. One of these groups had around 40k members. I checked the sidebar and rules - all seemed good. Then I had a look at the top few posts just to make sure that it seemed the right place to post an ad - also looked ok, other than one post where a dude had uploaded a picture of one of the moderators, calling her beautiful and whatnot. A little creepy but the comments seemed to agree with my opinion, so I just overlooked it. 

So I post the ad (basically stating what languages she teaches, the great reviews she has blah blah), and 5 minutes in it's doing really well - like the best an ad for this page has done so far. I'm pretty stoked and watch the likes flood in continuously. A few people get in contact, enquiring about prices and such. I reply and switch off the laptop about 15 mins later. Thanks to Murphy's law, I ran out of data earlier on in the day, so I told my mum to keep an eye on the messages whilst I was out as I wouldn't receive them. So I go out and about an hour after leaving I see like 10 messages from my mum. They started off along the lines of ""Why is the page suddenly getting loads of messages?"" and by message number 10 I read ""PLEASE DELETE WHATEVER YOU POSTED IM GETTING REALLY WEIRD PEOPLE CONTACTING ME IM TRYING TO DELETE THEM BUT I CANT"". I call her, but she can't answer as she's teaching so I rush home, open the page messaging service only to be greeted by an overwhelming number of ""enquiries"". I open the first one andddd.... Yep it's a dick pic. So is the one after that, and the one after that, and so on. At this point I'm just sitting there cringing about the fact that I just looked at probably the first dick pic my mum has ever seen... and the next 10 after that. Bare in mind that I have to go into every conversation in order to block the person, so there was no escaping this. 

My mum finished the lesson and I told her that I sorted it out, and explained to her that the fact that her profile picture was a picture of her (not a man basically) is probably what caused all these to come flooding in. She asked if I saw any of the messages and I replied with ""A few inevitably as I had to click on each conversation in order to get the block option"". I don't think my mum thinks I ever saw any naked human other than myself before this happened and it's 100000% awkward as she knows that I just went through and saw 15 dickpicks. Still have no clue as to why there were so many creeps on there but I guess that's just what comes with a big group.

Safe to say I'll be taking a brake from the business for a little while now. 

TL;DR I got quite a few dick pics sent to my mum's page due to an advert that I posted in a Facebook group. I'm pretty sure she didn't know what a dick pic was before this happened."
16,"TIFU by leaving a glory hole at my place


It's an actual today fuck-up and I'm hoping typing this out here will alleviate some of the embarrassment I'm feeling right now.  

About a year ago I moved to Santa Cruz for university and my uncle was courteous enough to let me use one of his places for as long as I want. He owns a few properties around here so it wasn't a huge deal to him but it meant a lot to me, especially since I didn't have to spend additional expenses to rent a place. But I'm in my early twenties and even though I'm not a party girl per se, I've done my share of stupid stuff-- namely, a few weeks ago, I decided to explore one of my kinks and ended up hosting a glory hole.  

I set it up in my backyard in a secluded area by the pool right next to the garage. Whatever, it happened, no big deal. My stupid self, however, absolutely forgot to clean up and make sure I move everything I used to set up the glory hole away. It couldn't have been more obvious. Condoms, the wooden panel with a hole in it, the napkins set on a table right next to it-- as obvious of a glory hole as you can get, virtually no way to spin it any other way.  

Here's the fuck up...  

My brother and his friends were planning a vacation in the area so naturally, wanting to lower their expenses, I told them they can stay at my place. It's huge, it has more than enough space for him and three of his friends-- plus, I don't see him often. They were ecstatic to stay here, especially since I have a pool and I can drive them around if they need to get places. I was more than happy to have them.  

They arrive, I show them around the place and help them settle in and leave them to their own devices. They're in their late teens, 17-18 year old, so they just changed and went straight to the pool. Not ten minutes pass before they discover the glory hole that I totally forgot to clean up or at least hide... and of course, they know what that is. They start asking questions and teasing me, my brother is slightly upset and I have no answers for them. Utterly embarrassed I just tell them to go upstairs and play on the x-box, they can come back in twenty minutes.  

I cleaned up but my god, I'm so embarrassed. I literally can't face them without being flustered-- and what's worse, they're staying here til the end of August.  Oh, and my new nickname according to them is ""the glory hunter"". 

It's 4 am right now, I'm still in shock and awe of my stupidity and I can honestly say, I've never been more embarrassed in my life. They will roast me for as long as I live...  

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR: I forgot to clean up a glory hole I set up at my place after exploring my kink. My brother and his friends, when visiting found it and now-- they can't stop teasing me."
17,"TIFU (18F) and now I’m hiding in my boyfriend’s closet. (18M)


This whole summer, I’ve only seen my boyfriend on Saturday’s for catholic mass with his family. His parents are strict and don’t allow us the space nor time to be together aside from the two hours after mass. I’ve been dating my boyfriend for approximately a year and a half. 

SO- today we decided that I should sneak over to his empty house as both of his parents are working, and his brothers are no longer in the house/ have officially moved out. His parents work from 6AM to 4PM. Cut to present time, I arrived today at his house around 8AM. I was sitting in his bed with him (his room is on the second floor) and practically, all of a sudden- we hear keys jingling around at the back door where the family garage is. So at this point, I jump my ass up and move immediately to his bathroom (which is connected to his room). 

He whispers to me his dad must have gotten out of work early, and we hear him walking around the first floor of the house. So we’re both silently panicking, the first move he makes is to quickly and quietly clear out his bedroom closet- move my purse and shoes inside, as well as making space for me to sit inside. I’ve never been so self conscious about where I step as I have been today, the bedroom floor is wood and if I were to make enough noise- it would indicate his father of my presence. 

So now, I await either my impending death for being an idiot or I pray I have enough good luck that I will be able to escape without a trace. 

TL;DR: strict parents, I snuck over, and am now stuck in my boyfriend’s closet for I don’t know how long until his dad leaves or finds out that I’m here."
18,"TIFU by going on a vertical drop water slide.


Probably a NSFW story. For context I am a female, and I'm on the thicker side. Not obese, but definitely not skinny. Just in case it matters to the story.

So, we're at Silverwood. I decided to try the one water slide that is just a vertical drop and it's over. So, I get on, and the lady said to cross your legs. I thought it was just to protect your legs, so I didn't put that much force into it. How I regret not putting more force into it.

See where this is going?

So I start going. The water begins to build up on my butt, but that's common for me. But what was weird was it started so early. I didn't think much of it, I was just thinking about how fast it was. I'm a thrill seeker when it comes to rides and stuff, so that was right up my alley.

And then, it was literally up my alley.

I come zooming down into the flat part, and I swear. That fucking water slide took my virginity, and it wasn't gentle. Every orface that water could force it's way up, it did. I did not need a douching, thank you very much, especially not one up the ass with public pool water! I was farting and/or leaking water for a few minutes, until I couldn't tell if it was still water, farts, or liquid shit coming out my ass, so I excused myself to the bathroom.

It was still water, btw.

So to summarize my experience: It was fun for the first 3-5 seconds, and then I got a very thorough nether region cleansing. But what did it cost?

My dignity.

TL;DR I was raped by a public water slide. ""Where's the leak ma'am?"" ""Everywhere."""
19,"TIFU by going to the emergency room after pulling a muscle during sex. [NSFW]


This fuck up, like most fuck ups here, did not happen today, but a few months ago. My girlfriend and I were going at it pretty hot and heavy, and I guess I over-exerted myself and pulled a muscle right by my hip. I didn't notice until the following day, but it would hurt whenever I would bend over or twist a certain way. The day after that, it hurt to even sit up. A lot. I thought I had appendicitis. So, I debated on what to do for a few hours, decided to call into work and head to the emergency room because I didn't want to die. I proceeded to lie there for the next 4 hours while they tried to figure out what was wrong, ran some tests, etc. They couldn't find anything with my appendix and said it was most likely musculo-skeletal, and that's when I remembered the events from the previous night and put 2+2 together. I'm still receiving bills two months later, and thanks to the wonderful US healthcare system, those bills have totaled over $1k so far, which I do not have. 

Tl;dr It cost me over a thousand dollars to dick my gf down."
20,"TIFU by putting my nutsack on my girfriends forehead


TL;DR after the story.

First of all, YES, you read it correctly. 

So me and my girlfriend are quite childish and dumb tbh. We like to mess around, say stupid things and altogether goof around.

Straight to the point. Happened today. Came out from the shower after a little fun time in bed, dried myself in the shower so was buttnaked. Girlfriend wrapped in a towel laying on the couch browsing social media. 

I walk up to her and just stand on the couch and state to her that I'm planting my ballsack on her face. Not a biggie. HERE COMETH THE FU. She laughs about it and i tell her to take a picture of it. She uses snapchat to take it and shows the ridiculousness of a picture of my hairy buttcrack and spikeless hedgehog looking ballsack. Again, we laugh about it and she decides to SAVE the picture. I try to interfere and aim for the 'BACK' button on her phone to send the picture to bytehell. I press it and she sets her phone down on the table.

Well on snapchat there is this one button that adds snaps straight to the 'My story' which can be viewed by all her contacts for those who didn't know. And conveniently enough it's positioned right next to the 'Back' button of her phone. And I happened to press THAT instead of the 'back' button. 

Flash forward couple minutes, she pics up her phone as I'm in the toilet and starts screaming ""OMG"" ""NO"" and stuff. I'm like ""ha, she did something dumb"". She proceeds to tell me that THE snap went out for every single one of her contact's to see. She recieves messages asking wtf is going on and most importantly, WHY the f***. She's very embarrassed as she takes it out of her My story and tells me she may cry a little. 

So I guess me and her are just gonna stay home for the rest of our lives and try to avoid every friend of ours. Idk might aswell move to Alaska.

TL;DR 

I let my girfriend take a selfie with my ballsack on her face for laughs and accidentally send it to 'My story' on snapchat for all her contacts to see for several minutes."
21,"TIFU by locking my pregnant wife in the shower


This happened last night. My very (8 months) pregnant wife and I have been staying at my grandparents house in a Beach town for the summer while working a pair of summer jobs while our house is being renovated. (I work in a school district and she is finishing up a degree.) If you have ever been to most beach towns the houses usually come equiped with an outdoor shower. Most are enclosed for privacy like ours is so many residents take normally showers in there as well. It's also quite spacious so two people fit into it quite easily. My wife being rather full of child as it were has had a struggle washing. So me being the wonderfully diligent husband suggested I join her so I can help her with it. No other reason than that, none what so ever. 

Anyway yesterday after a long hot day at work I tell my wife I'm going to take a shower before work into which she replies that she will be joining me. Who am I to complain about that. Shower goes as planned, nothing crazy just a simple scubadub then a nice relaxing evening. I had plans to play some vidya with my boys, was looking forward to it.

 This is where I fuck up. Normally I let her tie a towel on and let her leave first. But today I wanted to hurry so that I could get set up with the boys. I grabbed my towel, tied it up, walked out and flipped the latch that locks the shower from the outside. Just like I normally do when I shower alone. I walk inside, though the kitchen that my grandparents are making a bit of dinner and up to our room to get myself set up.

After about 5 minutes I start to think my wife is taking a long time talking to my grandparents in just a towel. As I am thinking that the door bursts open with a very angry my wife screaming ""You think that was fucking funny?!"" I  sputter with a ""What was funny?"" ""Locking me in a fucking shower you fucking walnut!"" I deadpan realize what I did. Turns out she was banging on the wall that is connected to the kitchen from basically the moment I walked into the house. Luckly my grandparents heard her and let her out quickly. The relative short time of her containment did not make the level of her anger any smaller though. Luckly for me pregnant my wife can be bribed with icecream and backrubs so I didn't have to sleep on the couch.

TLDR: Locked pregnant wife in outdoor shower because dumb, called a walnut and had to go get icecream and give back rubs to be allowed to sleep in bed."
22,"TIFU by cliff jumping on my period


TLDR at the end ;)


Okay so all you ladies will get me, but I’ll explain a little bit for the guys out there... It was my “last” day on my period. I was kinda spotty but I didn’t really have a flow. I was debating whether or not to even wear a tampon. We (friends, cute boys and I) we’re going to boat all day so a panty liner was not an option. It took me a while to decide what to do. I went back and forth between wearing no tampon and just hopping in the water as often as possible or just having to deal with pulling a dry tampon out later. It sounds stupid but I was debating this forever. (Dry tampons suck)

Flash forward a few hours and we’re cliff jumping off the red rocks. I ended up jumping off at 50 ft for my highest jump. I was having a blast.

Flash forward another few hours and we stopped at the store by the docks. I went to the bathroom to pull... out... my dry tampon?? To make sure I wasn’t... too... spotty?? I couldn’t remember if I put one in, but there wasn’t a string so I figured I never put one in.

Flash forward another 8 hours and, to my horror, I can feel a rounded cotton bit shoved up my vagina. It’s deep in there. And when I say deep, I mean, I can barely reach it with my MIDDLE finger (sorry for the visual.)

Flash forward about 20 minutes and I’m on all fours of a gas station bathroom floor, with a friend (I haven’t known more than a week) palm deep with rubber dish gloves up my va-jay-jay fishing for a rotten, dry, painful tampon.

Had some good laughs about it, but I do NOT plan on wearing a tampon cliff jumping again

TLDR: forgot I had a tampon in and cliff jumped so it forcefully got stuck up my hoo-ha"
