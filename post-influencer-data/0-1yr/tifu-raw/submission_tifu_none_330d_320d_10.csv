0,"TIFU by playing a stupid game.


TL;DR at the end.

So almost every night before bed, I’ll strip down, brush my teeth and then browse reddit on my phone while doing my business.  Occasionally, my legs will start to fall asleep, and most times I’ll finish up and go to bed, but every once in a while I’ll turn it into a game.  Now the game is, I need to wait until I’m absolutely dead legged. No feeling at all whatsoever.  Then, once they’re fully asleep, I’ll stand up and try to walk back to the bedroom before they get to the intense tingly part that all but paralyzes me for a short period.

Fast forward to last night.

My legs began to fall asleep and I thought “hey! Why don’t we do the thing!”  So, in true gamey fashion, I let my legs fall fully asleep. I finished up, and began my numb trek back to the bedroom.  Somehow I wasn’t as quick as usual, and the tingly feeling onset pretty quickly.  Queue my Mother In Law who I had forgotten was staying the night, getting up for a glass of milk before bed. At this point I’m paralyzed twice over.  Once because of the tingles, twice because of the fear of my MIL finding me naked in the hallway just standing still.

She comes up the stairs (which join to the hallway) and luckily doesn’t look my way, she just heads straight to the kitchen.  In my intellectual genius, I decide to try and do a “feet only moonwalk” style movement to the bedroom as this will cause the least amount of tingles.  Wrong.  I flexed my left foot and immediately crashed onto the floor, prompting my MIL to investigate.  She saw my naked terrified ass on the floor inchworming towards my bedroom.

I tried to play it off like I was sleepwalking though I have zero history of it. I made sure to stay in bed until she left for her errands this morning, and I am not looking forward to dinner tonight.  Hopefully we can just awkwardly pretend it never happened and move on.

TL;DR: My MIL saw me naked on the ground wriggling to my bedroom."
1,"TIFU By Someone her actually problems.


I've had 6hrs sleep (not incl the naps on the bus) in the last ~40hrs. A girl I had not seen in years and had the hots for showed up at my work. She introduces me to her older friend was this jaded girl 40 year old woman who kept picking sociopaths and narcissists for potential partners but JUST WOULDN'T SHUT UP. For 4 maybe 5 hrs she openly spoke about her relations with her ex-husband and other relationship issues ranging from insecurity to being taken advantage of. She finally got to a portion where she went on a tangent about childhood trauma and I got tired of it and I told her straight up her trauma isn't a childhood issue but that of a former marriage issue (not being able to let go). Seeing as I'm a product of childhood physical and mental abuse and she seemed like another privileged complainer trying to justify her point by telling me, ""if a child never gets what they want like a toy, they don't know how to deal with it and it creates trauma in their life..."" That's not trauma... that's growing up, that's life.

&amp;nbsp;

She got ultra defensive after I mentioned the marriage thing saying that, 'I don't know her and her past and what she's been through in her childhood etc.."" So I responded asking about her past and what was this trauma? She tells me she doesn't want or need to tell me. I respond with, ""I'm some stranger, like I can really use this against you right? Some stranger can use your childhood trauma against you"".

&amp;nbsp;

This ""lady"" basically played wounded deer at that point when we got called back to work. Afterwards hot girl didn't even bother to say goodbye and they both take off. Now my problem is if she complains to someone citing I ""harassed her"" I am unsure what may happen.


&amp;nbsp;

I just want to say if this goes viral or more likely to downvote hell, I'm not a sociopath, but I've become quite numb to empathy. Seeing as I'm more adept at listening and it's  not hard to profile someone that gives you 4-5hrs of details of who they are 

TL;DR
&amp;nbsp; Saw girl I had the hots for long ago, she was cold with me because her work friend was complaining about being mistreated, I was and got tired of hearing it so I told her the truth, her friend acted like a wounded deer and probably hates me more than those douchebags she dated. May or may not have committed career suicide."
2,"TIFU by feeling up my wife's arse in front of our whole church.


First off, let me say I am a pastor, which is why this fits into the TIFU category. This happened on Sunday - dealing with the ramifications this week.

I am in charge of the worship, arts and communication aspects of our church. My wife, who is a superb pianist, volunteers at the church.

It was the end of our service on Sunday, and we typically close with a worship song of response to the pastors teaching. Our platform has side entrances that come in from the rehearsal rooms, and towards the end of the sermon, I and the other band members usually wait out of site at the doors. Our pastor begins his last sentences, usually a prayer, and we slip.out quietly to begin the song.
This Sunday, our pastor gave us a fakeout - we thought he was done and we started out, but he actually had a little more to say. Rather than edit back out the door or continue into the front of the platform while he was still preaching, I decided to just sit next to my wife on the piano bench, which is towards the back and semi-obscured (I thought) by other instruments.

My wife and I have a very close, affectionate relationship. I think she's the hottest thing walking the earth, and she reciprocates :). When I sat next to her, close by necessity, I habitually put my arm around her, my hand resting on her opposite hip, which is the way we sit next to each other on the couch. I also began reflexively gently squeezing her hip, and truth be told, rubbing my hand back around on to her butt cheek occasionally. Honestly, I wasn't even thinking about it, I was listening to the pastor wrap up. It's just the way we sit together.

Well, the location we were sitting at behind the Nord stage 3 keyboard and a guitar on a stand was NOT as hidden as I presumed, and an entire section of the congregation were treated to the view of me massaging my wife's butt. Not only that, but we do IMAG of the stage (using cameras to put a live camera shot on large projection screens. It's a big church) and apparently one of the camera shots clearly picked this up in the background. 

The sermon ended, we did the closing song and went home. Nobody said a word to us, lol. However, both my and my senior pastors inboxes were LIT with emails pointing out what happened! Some were funny, with a gentle notification of what happened, and to be careful. Some thought it was hilarious, and laughed along with me. Others...not so much.

I also learned that though we've been at this church for three years and everyone knows me, not everyone knows my wife or knows that it's my wife who's playing the piano. They actually thought I was sexually assaulting some poor volunteer, right there in their sanctuary, and were demanding the pastor call the police (!).

My pastor has responded graciously to each email, as have I. But, were trying to decide whether to ""own it"" and say something about next Sunday, in case somebody else was thinking bad thoughts and just not saying anything, or do we just let it ""fade away"" and move on.

I'm voting for saying something, and sharing with everyone that we are indeed very happily married, and making a humorous announcement about it, along with an apology. Something along the lines of ""I promise to never massage my wife's arse as part of our worship ever again""...
The bonus - we live stream our services and so I now have video evidence of my ""roaming hands"", and witty church members are starting to send my funny (to THEM) memes and gifs with my errant fondle as the central subject.

Lord deliver me!

TL;DR - pastor accidentally fondles his wife's arse for five minutes on the big screens during worship.

4,"TIFU by letting the gas tank drop to 1/4 (Educational TIFU)


Throwaway. Happened today.

I’ve known that my car has had a few issues for a while, but alas I have not been able to address them due to a lack of funds. One such problem was the fuel pump. A good, functioning pump should buzz when the key is turned to the ignition on position (just before you start the car position).  Mine made no such noise. Another way I knew the fuel pump was faulty was by disconnecting the fuel line to the engine and dunking it in a Jerry can full of diesel. The car works no problem in this way. 

Consequently, I always kept the tank full so the car was mostly relying on pressure supplying the engine, and probably some small input from the pump.

For the last few weeks, I could not fill up the car, due to a lack of funds. So the car came to a halt with about a 1/4 of a tank left. Luckily this happened within 10 metres of a petrol station, and about 2 miles from home. I, and a very nice Uber driver pushed the car in to the station. 

I proceeded to put £7 (approx. 5.5litres) in the tank (because I did not have any more to put in), taking it to a whopping 3/8 of a tank in total. Luckily the damn thing started and i shot off home. And the car died again, just as I was parking up.

Another car died right next to mine, so we also helped push that one and just got chatting in general. This is my first “break down” and I will always remember it.

1) Always have an emergency fund.
2) Fix problems asap.

Sorry for my bad English, it’s not my first language.

TL;DR

Was having fuel pump issues, tank ran too low and pump couldn’t pump gas to the engine. Had a cool time with a couple of guys, and a big lesson for me. "

6,"TIFU by sending a text at work to everyone in our system


*Disclaimer: this did not happen to me, it happened to my coworker as I was sitting next to him. He's not a redditor, and while he made the mistake, I witnessed it all plus me and him both dealt with the clean-up. I am posting his story. I'm sorry if this isn't allow, it's just too good not to post. This also happened yesterday*    
&amp;nbsp;   
So I work at an after school program and we get over 200 kids each day coming to our facility. I work the front desk, which basically consists of signing people in, answering the phone, and talking to parents as they come to pick up their children. We also use a mass text message application, which basically allows us to send texts to the parents and categorize them by groups. I'm in charge of this application.    
So yesterday, one of the first graders peed his pants. Doesn't happen every day, but it's happened a couple of times since I began working here. I went to call his mother, and got her answering machine twice. I also realized that her voicemail was in Spanish, and that shed didn't speak any English.    
So I decided to use our texting service to let the mother know that her son needs to be brought a change of clothing. So I went to write the message (with the names of the mother and son), then pasted it into Google Translate.    
The message read:    
""Hola [Madre] Tengo a [Hijo] aquí y parece que hizo un accidente en sus pantalones. ¿Puedes traerle una muda de ropa?""     
Which translates to:    
""Hello [Mother] I have [Son] here and it seems that he made an accident in his pants. Can you bring him a change of clothes?""   
So I go to the bathroom after I send it, come back 2 minutes later, and I received 24 new messages of the app, and a random mother showing up with a change of clothing for their daughter. That's when I realized....I somehow sent the message to all 400 parents enrolled in the texting service. I immediately issued a retraction, but at this point the damage was done. Confused parents came in the rest of the night, believing their child had peed their pants and needed a change of clothing. I was humiliated and completed F'd up, and I'll never hear the end of it at work.    
&amp;nbsp;    
TL;DR: Kid peed his pants, went to text the mother about the situation, accidentally blasted the message to every parent in our system."
7,"TIFU by cat-calling my wife


Some background: my wife and I are married (duh) when this happened today. We’ve been married for a year and are in our early twenties, so we can still be pretty immature. We both work in local government in a small, bustling city, but in different departments. We pass each other a lot at work and see each other throughout the city from time to time on the job. 

Today, as I was driving down Main Street, I saw my wife walking away from city hall, presumably to get lunch. Thinking I’ll be slick and make her feel pretty, I did the classic cat-call whistle.

Even with her back turned to me, I could tell she was tensing up. Something didn’t seem right. So naturally, I call to her, but it still takes her a second to turn around, again because she looks upset. Finally, when I’m beside her on the road, she turns to me and sees who I am and looks upset and bothered. I had no idea what was wrong! I’m her nice, goofy husband, and she’s all bothered because I tried to make her feel pretty. 

I yelled to her that I loved her and I hoped she was having a good day and she said the same to me, albeit a little peeved. As I drove off to my task, a passerby walked up to her and I saw them exchange words. 

Now, some of you more eagle-eyed readers will know why I’m an idiot. As it turns out, that passerby was making sure she wasn’t being harassed. My wife tensed up because she has been cat-called by scary, rude men on the street before and she thought it was happening again. She tensed up because she thought she might be attacked or hurt! 

Fortunately, she told the passerby, “oh he’s my husband. He’s just annoying.” I’m in the clear. Still an idiot, though. 

TL;DR tried to make the wife feel pretty, instead made her feel terrified"
8,"TIFU by catching feelings


So let’s get one thing straight, I don’t genuinely fall for people very easily. 
I went on tinder and matched w a guy I had gone to high school with. I remember him being fairly cool so we texted here &amp; there. We decided we wanted to meet up and hang out so we did within like 2 days of matching on tinder. When I say the date was GREAT I mean it. I went into it thinking it was going to be awkward and friendly but lemme tell you that shit felt magical. The funny thing is we didn’t even do anything special. We sat in the car and talked and listened to music and it was the best thing I had experienced. We texted afterwards and realized we had soo much in common. I absolutely adore people that have a strong sense of self &amp; culture and luckily he embodied all of that. 
Fast forward to our second date. This was like 2 days after the 1st date. We decided we would just talk and listen to music again and it was good. We talked, we listened to music, made out a lil, etc. BUT THEN WE DECIDED TO GO TO HIS HOUSE AND IT WENT DOWNHILL. It was all fun and games until he said he didn’t have a condom. I didn’t make a big fuss out of it and just assumed we could try another time. He kept saying he wish he had one on him so we explored the plan B option. I told him I didn’t have a problem paying for the pill out of courtesy and he was like alright let’s go for it. It didn’t even last a minute before the dude decided to tell me he wasn’t comfortable with me. In the end I awkwardly got dressed &amp; went home 40 dollars broker because he actually used my card to pay for the pill. The poor dude had performance anxiety and still had the audacity to  friendzone me. Moral of the story is: guys ain’t shit &amp; if he has a twin bed don’t fuck him. 
TL;DR I caught feelings for a dude too quickly so I was willing to have sex but then he ended up having performance anxiety &amp; I went home 40 dollars brokers after having to buy Plan B when it really WASNT necessary. Also, the dude apparently needs “complete space” from me and hopes we can be friends in the future. *eyeroll* it was too good to be true. "
9,"Tifu Just wanted new friends, now I have new ""friends""


So me and my husband love to travel to San Antonio TX. So much we decided to find new fun stuff to do that the big city has to offer. So he finds this place that offers a fun Halloween party / dress up. So of course I said yes lets go. Turns out we have to sign up and submit a photo. I'm like cool they don't just let anyone in. So we submit all our info. Age and a about us. Literally 10minutes after signing up we get about 11 likes and 6 friends requests. Well my husband thinks ""oh cool these people really want to be our friends. "" just we dont sound like complete loser. We have a family and we are still young. It's hard to find friends with similar life style. Well during the day we get a msg from this one couple. They ask if we would like to go to dinner and grab drinks. And when will we be back in town. Well he comes home and I read the msgs and I come to realize that it's a swingers club. Which is cool but we have not talked about it let alone knew that's what we were signing up for. I go look at our profile he set up and in the about us part he wrote "" Were fun out going couple that likes to get and have fun and try new things. "" and I had to tell him that the new friends he made pretty much wanted to swing. Long story short funniest night of our marriage so far. Going on 10 years. He got so red in the face.
TL:DR just wanted to meet new friends, ended up signing up for a swingers club"
