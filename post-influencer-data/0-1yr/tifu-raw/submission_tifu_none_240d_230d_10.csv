0,"TIFU by posting my schlong on Reddit and then going shopping


Alright, so let me start off by saying that I always frequent this sub and never thought I’d have anything to post until today.

So to preface, I’m a 20 year old college student and like most my age I’m always horny.  To find sexual fun online, I’ve been posting over at r/massivecock and similar nsfw subreddits as a way to show off my man meat and have some fun with women online.  I engage in a fair share of dirty talk and roleplay but it usually only lasts for the day that I post and slowly dies down until my messages stop pouring in till my next post.

So today, I went to the mall to do some shopping and I also work in retail so I tend to know the ins and outs of coupons and discounts.  The particular store that I was at always sends coupons via email.  And the coupon I had on my phone was a unique code and had to be typed in.  So I hand the female cashier my phone and she holds it in her hand enough for both of us to see the screen as starts typing in my coupon code as her eyes move back and forth from her register screen to my phone.

Suddenly, I see a Reddit notification drop down from the top of my phone and my heart drops and I can see her facial expression immediately change.  There’s only one type of Reddit message I usually receive and it’s always nsfw.  I immediately become the monkaS meme and sweat profusely as she hands me back my phone and I can’t tell if she’s holding back laughter, or is embarrassed herself as she clearly turns red.  I quickly slide down on my phone to see what the notification was to see a message from a fellow redditor saying “fuck me with that fat brown horse cock.”

....

I don’t think I’ve ever felt that embarrassed in my life.  I paid as fast as I could and left without saying a word.  Don’t think I’ll be shopping at this store for a while...or ever again.  

She probably thinks I’m some bestiality roleplayer.  I didn’t expect to receive a message at that time since I haven’t posted in a while.  But what’s done is done, and at the end of the day I’ll still probably keep posting.  Lesson learned is turn notifications off!  

And to the redditor that messaged me that, check your PMs ;)

TL;DR - Posted pics of my meat on Reddit and received a very dirty nsfw message on my phone while a cashier was looking at it to type in a coupon.  "
1,"TIFU by not calling the cops on my neighbor


My neighbors are a Japanese couple around my parents age. One day last summer my wife is sleeping the balcony and suddenly starts yelling my neighbors name, let's call him Mr. N. She then runs inside and tells me that Mr. N is lying face down in the wooded area behind our house and is not responding. So I go down there and hop the fence into the wooded area and I start trying to wake him up. I am saying his name over and over and asking if he is okay. He is mumbling with his eyes closed and I'm wondering whether I should call an ambulance. His wife the  comes to her balcony and tells me to leave him alone. I ask her if he is okay and what happened. She tells me they had a fight and he got drunk said he was going out to the woods to kill himself. I asked if I should call an ambulance and she said no he's just being dramatic and again told me to just leave him there. I am super uncomfortable with all of this and I am conflicted but I decide to respect their privacy and I go back inside and tell my wife what happened. After a few minutes, we go back to the bacony and he is gone.  We then see one of those industrial style cable belts high up in the tree above where we found him (he works in a warehouse). Then it hits me. He tried to hang himself. As I say this outloud, my wife and I get chills. And we start discussing whether we should call the cops or an ambulance or a suicide hotline.  We are pretty young and have never been in a situation like this. We ultimately decide to not call anyone. We hear them fight alot the time. We know Mr. N can be dramatic. We are fond of this couple since they are japanese and my wife is chinese and they r the only Asians in our neighborhood. And we thought they would want to keep this private. This was the tifu. 

Anyways one night last weekend we heard fighting (nothing unusual). In the morning we saw an ambulance in front of their place. And the place has been dead quiet since. Mr. N's car has not moved, and the house has been dark and quiet. We know Mrs. N is there (we see her car come and go) but Mr. N definitely isnt. We fear the worst may have happened. And we feel tremendous guilt that we could have said something when we had the chance.

TL;DR : I didnt notify authorities when my neighbor unsuccessfully tried to commit suicide and he may have finally succeeded"
2,"TIFU by discovering my love of kimchi


Obligatory not today, it was about 2 years ago. So I had just landed a waitress job. Hell yeah. To celebrate, my friends took me out to the bars and I was dropped off at my house very very drunk.

&amp;#x200B;

I was poor at the time and had barely any food. At this point I was so fucking tired of potatoes and toast. So I took a peek in the fridge and there was ketchup, mayo, a tablespoon of butter... and my roommates extra spicy unopened bottle of kimchi. I used to think I hated kimchi. I love spicy food though so I figured what the heck, let's give it a try.

&amp;#x200B;

Holy shit it was DELICIOUS. At first I said just a bite (it wasn't mine after all). One entire bottle of kimchi later I was satisfied and passed out hard. Then I woke up for work the next day...

&amp;#x200B;

I'm pretty sure it was a fart that woke me up. My next 3 days were one continuous  fart, in front of my new customers, co-workers and bosses. It was relentless and so foul I couldn't even try to excuse  it.

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR : I love kimchi but its only good in moderation"

5,"TIFU by having someone buy alcohol for me.


Of course this happened a long time ago. My friend and I worked at Denny's as waiters in the mid 80's. We were 16-17 and needed some beer or anything really. 
Middle age cook looks/is shady af so we figure we can ask him. We had smoked plenty of weed with him(ours of course). Of course he agreed for a fee. No biggie, we were waiters making $100+ per night amd he was a cook making $8 or $9 per hour. 
Fast forward to just after end of shift. We pull over to a convenience store, give dude money. Oblivious to the ways of the world, this fucker comes running back, jumps in the back seat and starts telling us to ""Go go go.""
My buddy in his 70 something Trans-Am doesn't need to much coaxing to step on it.
Fast forward about 10 minutes and while we are pulled over in some parking lot all of a sudden we are surrounded by cops with lights and guns screaming at us to get out of the care and get down on the ground. 
First thought through my head is we've got beer and weed. We are so fucked. They completley ignore us but start manhandling the cook who is one big black dude.
Cops hardly even ask us any questions(couple of white kids) and tell us he robbed the liquor store at gunpoint and tell us to be careful who we let in our car. Lets us go. 
Never saw the cook again, I assume he went down for armed robbery. Found out later he had just been paroled for armed robbery when they had hired him from a halfway house. 
This could have gone so many different ways for me and my buddy. His type of bullshit wasn't on our radar.
That was an eye opener. Another one of the cooks borrowed $100 from me after a sob story. He never came back to work. It probably actually helped me out learning these lessons as a youngster. "

So I was trying to earn some money to get a new desk cause my old one got burnt, so I was searching around for a job when my good friend from high school messaged me. He told me about this natural health oil company he was signed with and that he was making boatloads of money off of it. He asked if I want in and, needing money for my desk, was like ""sure!""
 long story short its year 2 of 7 and i'm 2700 in debt

7,"TIFU: I asked my boss to demote me.


I've been working for my current employer basically for the last 17 yrs. I've gone through several different roles here. I've spent the longest amount of time as a repair and maintenance technician. I am really good at it. At least compared to my co-worked. I can get done in an hour was usually takes them several hours if not all day. I'm pretty valuable to my boss. Despite this, I've been underpaid for the majority of my time here but I stay because they used to be pretty loyal to their employees. This has slowly degenerated over the years. They charge a higher cost of insurance with less coverage every year and similar stunts. I have a masters degree in archtiecture and I could potentailly work making more money that way, but I have a hard time staying concentrated enough to be detail oriented. I don't really have any skills that I could take anywhere else. I have a hard time making or keeping friends because I feel so shut out and over whelmed by how I am treated here.

&amp;#x200B;

Anyway, about 3 yrs ago, our facilities manager retired. I thought that would be right up my ally. I know buildings and I know maintenance. I went to the CEO that I have known for 20 yrs and asked for the position. He deliberated with other managment and they said yes, as long as I help out the crew that I was currently working with. Thinking that I could handle it, I said yes. I've worked hard at both jobs, but because they are both full time positions, I get in trouble for not completing tasks all the time. On top of all of this, I have several rolls on the safety team. Ihave taken several different scenarios to my bosses asking to help clarify my roll and to eliminate cross over. I asked several time to be made a manager and to be put full time in the facilities position. They alwayys start by saying yes, then I get called into someone's office because I didn't ask the right person first. Now I'm in trouble because I'm going above peoples heads... Anyway a lot of drama. This last christmas, I was reminding co workers of the CPR class that I was teaching when my direct supervisor totally blew his top. Why was I taking his crew members off the floor for a class? (This is an osha required class. These people attending were volunteers) I had enough. I went to his supervisor (The one I originally offended for ""going above his head"" ) and asked to be taken off of the facilities role.

&amp;#x200B;

Why this is a problem: had I stuck it out for a few months, I probably could have worked things out to take over the roll of someone else who was retiring. I finally would have had my chance to work on my own and get away from having to ""support"" my original crew. I probably would have gotten a raise as well.

&amp;#x200B;

I was just so sick of their games. Making me beg for scraps at the table. I'm trying to work my angles to get back into the architecure feild, but I'm worried that if I do, I'll just screw up there as well. I'm worried that I've totally screwed up anything that I've worked for here. I can't support my family at this job. I'll never get into a managment position.

TL:DR  I've worked hard to get promoted but I've only been thrown scraps. Just before I could have made a slightly bigger jump, I asked to be demoted because I was sick of playing there games.

13,"TIFU by joking around with airport security


This particular incident happened during the worst immigrant crisis in Europe and on top of that we had IS making threats everywhere so airport security was a nightmare unless you were the token white guy. 

&amp;#x200B;

At this particular airport, I was stopped every single time and checked for gunpowder and a lot of questions where I was headed and why I went into the country so often. It got to a point where I was a nervous wreck and then I decided to make one of the biggest mistakes of my life. As usual I started to fidget and started to sweat a lot right after putting my jacket down on the tray, walking through security I got flagged and they asked me if I handled some gunpowder recently to which I said ""Don´t you realize by now that I am from Colombia, we don't smuggle gunpowder, we smuggle bags of cocaine."" I started laughing like crazy...well... they didn't!

&amp;#x200B;

I was quickly taken into a room, my bags searched, question after question. And I mean it looked suspicious I went into this country about 2 times per month (very cheap airfare) and just for 1 day at a time. They probably called every single police officer into that room and I spoke with numerous people to try and plead my case, in the end, I managed to get my phone back and log into my bank to show them what I was doing during my day trips. I was let go with a very stern warning to never do this again. To this day when I enter the security at this particular airport, a few people always smile at me and a few of them even joke with me about it. 

&amp;#x200B;

I don't really know if I am on any security list out there but I will not try to go to the US anytime soon... 

&amp;#x200B;

 TL;DR  made a cocain joke at the airport security and got put in a detention room.

15,"TIFU - Called Police on Myself in Foreign Country


This happened 1 hour ago - I've been a long time lurker and this is my first incident worthy of posting. Strap in this is going to be long but was an epic FU.

&amp;#x200B;

Background: 2 years ago I was in Greece on a work trip and got robbed in my villa on the **very first night** we arrived while sleeping after a 24+ hr trip. Someone broke into the villa stole all my bags **from the room in which I was sleeping** which hadn't even been unpacked yet and left - I passed out at 2am with **my computer next to me listening to youtube** and woke up at 2:45am to the sound of the person getting away with all my stuff, computer, passport, clothes etc. etc. 

&amp;#x200B;

Fast forward to tonight: I arrive to Hong Kong after a very long 36 hr trip from the US having stopped off in Europe for meetings with clients for the day yesterday and get to my hotel here with virtually 4 hrs of shitty airplane sleep in between two long red eye flights having left home on Sunday afternoon - and it's now technically Tuesday afternoon US time. 

&amp;#x200B;

I arrive to my hotel at 8pm, check in and jump in the shower for a well deserved refresher, then jump on my bed with my phone to check emails, I noticed my window curtain was slightly open - This is where the FU began. I **ALWAYS** use my computer to watch youtube never my phone and normally fall asleep with my computer next to me every night.. After a while I jump out of my sleep because I didn't plan to sleep and was starving, my whole plan was to grab dinner before bed. I look at my watch (Smartwatch - It says 2:48) so I'm like WTF I slept for almost 7 hrs thats crazy it only felt like 1 hr. I call the front desk and ask the lady the time and in her thick accent I hear her say 2:48 (when in reality she said 10:48) so now I'm like damn I had some emails to send out I need to get on top of this. Turn to my bed to grab my computer to check the time and emails because obviously its there because I passed out listening to youtube.... It's nowhere to be found....  **WTF! -**  Flashback to Greece 2 years ago first night, foreign country fell asleep listening to youtube all my shit gone. I now start tearing apart the room searching removed bedsheets, pillows, everything. Looked for my passport its safe in my jacket my bags have not been touched because my towel is still on top of them and everything is in place EXCEPT my computer. I then notice my curtain was closed.. **WTF** someone was in here.

&amp;#x200B;

I call the front desk and go talk to the manager saying my computer was stolen from my room and they need to review the cameras - fairly nice hotel and there is a camera right outside my door. They then tell me I cannot come to the security room to see the cameras but they will check - 5 mins later they tell me that no one came to my room - I call bullshit because my computer is missing so I said I'm calling the police - (which I did). All this time I am in the hotel lobby now talking to staff. 

&amp;#x200B;

Before the police come the manager tells me lets go upstairs to search for the computer I say fine even though I tore the place apart already searching. He brings his guys in and we proceed to go even more thoroughly searching and find nothing. He then asks me if I've looked in my bags and I was like not at all because I haven't even opened them yet and he asked if I minded if we looked just in case. I said be my guest so I start opening my hand luggage and sitting right in there is my laptop staring right back at me.. **Holy fuck** it's there... We look at each other and he's like is this it? and I'm saying yeah I mean for sure it is... thats my computer alright ... in my bag alright.... fuck. He then leaves to go tell his boss that we found it - Now I sit down and I'm like wtf did I sleepwalk? I've never done that... why the fuck is my curtain closed... and why is it 2:48am... was this some alien abduction missing time BS or what?? 

&amp;#x200B;

The thought then occurred to me that wait, I was in the lobby for close to 10 mins complaining about this. So they **MUST** have told their dude that I noticed and while I was down there they slipped it back into my bag as if it was there all along. YES that must be it!! Two minutes after this brainwave the police knock on my door. They take down my info and ask me what happened.. I proceed to tell them everything above and that I have my computer back now but I suspect it was planted there after I complained. They tell me ok they will go review the cameras. I ask to come the hotel manager tells me I cannot come due to security reasons.. I say well fine please record a video of it for me the police say ok fine but the manager says for privacy reasons he can't do this... So again I'm like fuck... The police is like man well you have to trust me you called us so you have to trust us.. I tell him with all respect I don't really trust anyone but in this case I really have no choice... 

&amp;#x200B;

Everyone leaves to check the cameras and I sit back down in complete amazement at wtf is going on. My mind is now moving at 100mph and then it hits me... **FUCK DUDE** ... you actually never took your computer out of the bag ... you put a youtube video on your **PHONE!!!** vague memory of the youtube app opening sequence on android popped into my head I remember it because I never use the damn thing.... then I looked at my watch and was like there is no way I slept 7 hrs... Now looked at my computer it was actually 11 pm and the issue is my smartwatch hadn't updated timezone from Europe yet... **IDIOT.**

&amp;#x200B;

10 Mins later the police come back and tell me what I already knew ...no one except me entered or exited my room. I sheepishly say thank you officer, I guess I made a mistake. Sorry for wasting your time, please have a good evening.... Still not sure why my curtain is closed... Had to have been me in my sleep delirium did it and don't remember.... What an epic FU to start the trip...

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR : Got into new country after very long trip. Thought I fell asleep watching youtube on my computer, woke up and it was nowhere to be found. Called the police because I didn't believe the hotel that no one came into my room. Turns out computer was in my bag all along and I actually used my phone to watch youtube. Called the police on myself. "
