"I was born with both a penis and a vagina, and im trying to be more confident in what I am, plus I love questions so lets do this! AMA


Eyyo guys. I was born with a 46,xx chromosome,  aka I’m intersex or a hermaphrodite. 
I was born with mostly female characteristics and a deformity in the vaginal area where there are semblances of male characteristics.

 I’m open to any questions, don’t be afraid!!! And if I’m not comfortable with what you’ve asked, I’ll tell you!! ❤️❤️❤️ but all types of questions are welcome! AMA"

"I quit a great-paying corporate job at 45 to find happiness every day. I started a failed business and two years later I own one that's starting to be successful. I've never known highs so high or lows so low. AMA.


Some background.  I'm currently 47, wife, 2 kids.  My corporate gig was in banking ($100k+) and I always got good reviews, but never advanced that much.  In 20+ yrs of doing it, I just never felt like I fit in.  I basically said, ""ok, showtime!"" every day I walked through the door.  My family doesn't have enough savings for retirement (not even close).  I planned my exit for years, and finally pulled the trigger after a conversation my wife and I had about teaching our children how to live a happy life (now our one and only goal as parents).  My first business was a food truck.  My recipes were awesome and everyone loved it.  I hated it.  After 4 months or so of getting it set up, I sold it after 2 weeks.  But I took my scone recipe and started [SendScones.com](https://SendScones.com).  I ship scones all over the country for any occasion.  It's been a year, and the business is starting to gain traction.  That said, there were a lot of days where my depression was so bad I didn't get out of bed.  I'd never experienced true depression before, so it hit hard.  I'm finding my triggers and coping strategies though (some through Reddit) and things have been much better lately.  Mostly I'm just learning to judge myself based on something other than money earned - that has been and continues to be difficult, and resulted in losing many of my friends.  The other day I heard my daughter tell a friend that she thought her dad had the best job in the world, and it almost made me cry.  As someone who has issues with considering myself a complete failure and incapable of making ""the right"" decision, that one little comment made me feel more successful in my life than anything else ever has.  Reddit, I'm not sure if I'm a complete and total loser who should be more appreciative of the job I had, or if I'm truly living MY life now, but go ahead, AMA."
"I'm just trying to get enough Karma to comment more than once every 10 minutes AMA

"Five year old ninja here AMA!


My 5 year old brother is a ninja and he wants to answer questions about being a ninja. I saw a post from someone else like this on r/casualiama so I asked my brother if he wanted to and he say yeah.  Questions can be about being a ninja or being 5 :). I may stop if he is being bothered by the questions so I’ll do maybe like 10-12 every 3-4 hours or so.

"I (27M)moved across the country to a state where I knew absolutely no one and started a new life AMA!


I used to be a heavy drug addict. I would IV(shoot up) fentynl on a daily basis. Resulting in 5 overdoses (1 was dead on arrival) I used to live in Detroit Michigan. One day while at the fentynl house it was raided by the FBI. I decided I needed to get clean so I moved across the country to a state where I knew no one, went to rehab and started a new life. AMA!"
"Trapped in a public restroom with no toilet paper AMA


Everyone’s worst nightmare has happened to me. I’m a guy who had to use a public restroom and ran out of toilet paper. Waiting it out now until a staff member walks in so I can request some TP."
"I'm good at guessing the gender of a cat just from a photo. AMA


Link to a pic of your cat, I bet I can guess the gender!
I've had cats in the house since I was born, I adore mine and I also spent a lot of time growing up in my neighbor's cattery with 80+ cats (Maine coons and Siberians).
I'm pretty sure I can do it well, but I don't know how else to test myself! Plus I LOVE looking at cat pictures and I know lots of others do too! 
Try me!

"I'm a female metal vocalist. I also have a stutter. AMA


No, I'm not famous. Not yet, anyway.

I'm doing this AMA because discussing my goals helps me stay focused on them. So you'd be doing me a big favor. Even the most unrelated/off-the-wall questions are welcome.

Here's a bit of info:

I got into stage performance and singing at a young age and joined every project and drama group that would have me. I discovered metal when I was 12, and started training my voice for it when I was 15.

When I was 22 I had a seizure and was badly injured. That's when I developed the stutter. It's not severe, but it is noticeable.

After 10 years of dealing with health and family issues, I am finally chasing my dream again."
"I’m a gay ex-Mormon who grew up in the church and served as a missionary. Ask me anything.


I was in the closet until I turned 24. Before that I was a quintessential Mormon kid.  Church every week, early morning bible study class (seminary), no drinking/drugs/coffee, two years in Eastern Europe as a missionary, college at a Mormon University, almost asking my girlfriend to marry me etc.
After depression forced me to an all time low in my life, I had to face some hard truths. I knew I was gay, and I lost what was left of my faith on my mission. I came out to my family and friends and have been walking a newer and healthier path ever since."
