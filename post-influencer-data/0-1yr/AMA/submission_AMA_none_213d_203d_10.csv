"I have 4 moms (and a stepdad). AMA


Explanation: my mom and dad got divorced when I was 2 because my mom left him for a woman. When I was 9 they separated and at the same time my dad underwent gender reassignment surgery and is now my mom. after my bio-mom and her gf split, she got remarried to a man, and the woman she was with also got remarried (to another woman), who I also consider one of my moms. I’m 19 now and in college. I have a very colorful, LGBT centric life and people are always very curious so I figured I’d post here lmao"
"I spent a year in a Bangkok prison. AMA.


I’ve done an AMA about this before because lots of people had asked me to when I mentioned it in comments. It went a bit downhill in the comments because some where more focused on my crime/behaviour than the actual prison experience. 

I have been taking more openly about it to some people irl and delving deep into some memories I had really suppressed. They’ve told me I should do another AMA because of some of the stories I’ve shared. 

So here it is. We’ll get the obvious questions out of the way:

**What did you do?**

I, a recovering drug addict, decided to treat myself to a holiday for my birthday because I’d been clean for a while, had a decent job and had money and holiday time to take off. I had a nice 2 week getaway on Koh Samui. Paradise. It was my birthday every night ;) and I had a really great time. Volunteered at a monkey sanctuary and got to feed and play with 13 baby monkeys every morning! It was a real nice break. 

Then came the journey home. Because I’m a /r/madlad I had scheduled the flights to land in Heathrow at 6am, and I had work that day at 9am. All I wanted to do was sleep sleep sleep. I had to be rested properly to cope at work. On the coach journey to the airport I met a NZ guy who offered me some Valium. Of course I said “yes! That would be perfect!” I took a few and slept the whole way there. I remember being woken up by the guy that sold me the Valium and he was like “dude you slept the whole way! That’s awesome!”. It was at this stage I must’ve bought more off him because I ended up with a few strips of 10mg Valium pills. 

Got to the airport and realised I was 14 hours early for my flight. Oh boy. I couldn’t check in for ages so I decided I would try and sleep somewhere. Took a couple more Valium, wondered around, couldn’t find anywhere, took more Valium, tried to sleep on the floor, took more Valium, couldn’t sleep. At one point I was hungry and decided I’d go get something to eat. I sat down at a restaurant and had a meal, with a few beers on the side. 

At this stage I estimate I’d take around 14 Valium pills. You kind of forget you’ve taken them at some point and just keep popping them. Mix that with beer and this is where it’s all a bit hazy for me. 

I checked in. I was wondering around trying to blag my way into VIP lounges and stuff, I vaguely remember doing this. I was just wondering around completely in another world. Can’t remember many of those hours in the airport. 

What I apparently did was walk out of duty-free with basket of cigarettes and booze. I already had a bag full of cigarettes and booze that I’d bought. I didn’t need this stuff and I don’t remember having a conscious thought to try and steal fucking cigarettes at a Bangkok airport. But I do vaguely remember doing it. 

I think I got away with it at first. I walked around for a bit and realised what I’d done. I started trying to find somewhere to hide for 90 minutes and just bail onto my plane. I don’t really know, I have vague memories of this ordeal. I do remember being asked to “stay there” by a member of airport staff. And next thing I know I’m surrounded by 3 policemen with big shiny revolvers. 

I couldn’t really explain what I’d done or why I’d done it. I was confused as the rest of them. But they got me on the phone to the embassy, who phoned my mum and we were trying to find a way to get me some cash to pay for all this stuff. That’s all they wanted was the money for the goods or I was going to prison. They gave me 20 minutes. 

The only way to get the money to me would’ve been western union. The embassy was talking my mum through what to do when I was informed the western union shop in the airport is closed now. Well shit. Off to jail I go. I thought I’d get a fine or a slap on the wrist or something. Man was I wrong...

**How long was your sentence?**

365 days. I was released in June 2017. 


So that’s the crux of the story. It was a wild ride in there and I met some pretty crazy people. Saw some equally crazy shit. It was an all-round shit experience.

I’ve been remembering more and more of the smaller details recently because I’ve been talking about it to a friend. It’s a pretty unique story and I’m happy I am able share my experiences with a different kind of perspective now, and also share any lessons I may have learned along the way.
