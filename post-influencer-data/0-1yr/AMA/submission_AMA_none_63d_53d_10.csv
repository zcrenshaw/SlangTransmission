"I Am A 31 year old white male, and former, long time Skid Row, LA heroin junkie (and addict to any other narcotic) with 17 years of addiction who is finally sober. I have seen it all. Ask me ANYTHING.


My problems with Heroin began around the age of 17. It wasn't the first drug I used. That was alcohol, and it started a whole slew of problems that have torn my life to shreds up until a few months ago.. I was never brought up around drugs, always lived in a good neighborhood, never really had access, but my mother was an alcoholic and despite being careful about leaving liquor or wine laying around where I could get my hands on it, sometimes she'd get too drunk to remember to put it away, and this is where my problems began..  


On my 14th christmas, Mom got sloshed with the sisters, so sloshed, they had to take her upstairs to her bed with a loaf of bread.. This was my opening, I wanted in and I wasn't getting it, so I snatched the bottle of spiced rum and swiftly poured some in to a water bottle, and replaced some of the bottles contents with a little water and some clear rum from another bottle to even it up a little.. Looked believable, I was good..   


Later that night, when everyone was asleep, I got to watching Adult Swim and downing the rum, gagging away.. I was resisting the urge to vomit but I kept at it regardless, I was DETERMINED to get fucked up.. I had no idea what I was doing, and boy, DID I get fucked up.. So fucked up, that I don't remember anything after finishing the bottle, only waking up with a pounding headache to a screaming mother, demanding to know where all of the window shutters on the house went.. The answer.. With a hard knock to my knuckles as I roll over... Stacked up in my bed next to me.  


Every. Single. Window. Shutter..  


My shirt is on inside out, I'm naked from the waist down, except for one sock, which is also, mysteriously inside out.. All of my clothes are strewn across my room, there's spilt drinks, food everywhere, the TV is jacked and on its side, on Lifetime, of all things..  


Years of drinking cough syrup and huffing air duster, and then, at the age of 17, almost 18, I had to have my wisdom teeth removed, and was inevitably prescribed painkillers, Hydrocodone.. I had found my GOD. My addictions became severely worse after this, not having access to more opiates, I started using everything else in higher frequency..  


The search for opiates had begun, though.. I had already done research online and found I could grow magic mushrooms while I was arming myself with every bit of knowledge on opiates I could get.. While asking around on foot, I had found a weed connect, which was a plus.. Now I was smoking weed and growing mushrooms, and in the meantime, getting to know where the heroin was at through my dealer.. The drive to get it was so strong that I worked up enough to get a car, so that I could get back and forth from the city to buy dope.  


This is where everything went seriously downhill.. I was coming of age, had no plans for the future, and was getting strung out on opiates, and opioids.. I wound up meeting a girl online who lived in San Diego, California, though at the time I was living in New York, but we were totally in love with each other, we'd game non-stop, and both had no lives.. I ultimately ended up moving to San Diego and got together with her, after finding out that her mom got prescribed Oxycontin.. I could be with my girl and not be sick.. By stealing her moms pills.. Oh, I was not well at all, I was very sick at this point, mentally sick..  


I moved in with this girl and her mother successfully, using the snake-like charm most addicts develop as a means of fucking people over, and got higher than ever.. This girls mom had the JACKPOT. Not only did she have Oxycontin, she had METH! I was ECSTATIC! Until she kicked us out.. Luck had it however that her grandfather died shortly after and she inherited a bunch of money, which lead to us buying a truck and camper, and ultimately, winding up in a place called Slab City, which you can also ask me questions about, and get info about on Youtube, it's located in southern California by the Salton Sea, in the desert..  


You can only imagine what happened here, the place is ravaged with meth, government psychological experiments and games, testing of all sorts, they have a bombing range and test all kinds of drones and weird aircraft, a great place to lose your mind.. My girlfriend wound up cheating on me here as I descended in to temporary madness, and took off in the truck, leaving me stranded.. Boy was I fucked..  


Dying of thirst, and hungry, I began the 5 mile walk to town to get \*something,\* anything, but while passing the tracks, I met some kids hopping off a freight train who gave me some food, water, smoked me out with some weed, they knew I was strung out and on meth, and in bad shape, so they took me in.. These are the kids who wound up teaching me how to hop freight to get around, since I'd been left for dead by the girlfriend.. I was already heavy in to punk rock, super anti-authoritarian and well versed in government conspiracy, and political bullshit, so I fit right in, this is where my life as a real punk began, lmao, or so I had it in my head.. I was learning how to fuck the system.. Really I was learning to fuck myself.  


So at the age of 22, I'm now a train hopping addict, quickly gaining a criminal record, and we jump 7 years forward to what started, at the age of 29, to well in to the age of 31, my stay in Skid Row, the worst environment I've ever been in.. The crime scene is gigantic, it's full of conspiracy against the homeless, I suspect some possible testing with diseases and the rat populations and the parasites they carry.. Fleas, body lice, carrying diseases from the rats.. Half the population there is using the train system to get around the city to boost from stores, and sell the goods to Mexicans who buy the goods back at severely reduced prices.. Something that is 75 bucks off the rack will net you 5 dollars.. They're exploiting the addicts, stores are putting stickers on foods saying ""if this was sold somewhere other than \_\_\_\_ please report to..."" I've seen people get stabbed, shot, I've seen women running naked down the street screaming for help, bleeding from the crotch.. I could go on and on.. But I'll leave some mystery for people to poke around with their questions..  


Go on, get creative, dig deep, ask away, I'll answer anything.. No censorship here. I'll touch the most taboo of subjects."
"I was supposed to be getting married today, but instead I just published a poetry book on heartbreak, heartache and hope.


It was only three months ago that I asked her what was wrong. Little did I know that that question would end my engagement, and set me on the path of writing and publishing my latest poetry book '[conversations with ghosts](https://www.amazon.com/Conversations-Ghosts-Ryan-Donnelly/dp/107916040X/ref=sr_1_1?keywords=conversations+with+ghosts+ryan+donnelly&amp;qid=1563029098&amp;s=gateway&amp;sr=8-1)' 

It is my hope that this book will help others to accept the pain that comes along with the loss, and work at finding a better day through self-reflection. 

I know what it feels like to feel hopelessly alone, and I want others to know that at least one other person understands how they feel. 

Love is one very scary road to walk, and yet, we always try to walk it anyway."

"It was a long time coming, but I finally got to adopt these monsters.


I posted a link to r/pics today ([https://www.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/cdj0lp/it\_was\_a\_long\_time\_coming\_but\_i\_finally\_got\_to/](https://www.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/cdj0lp/it_was_a_long_time_coming_but_i_finally_got_to/)), and I got a lot of questions about the adoption process, fostering, parenting and more. I'd like to thank the mods of r/pics, they do an amazing job of keeping the riff-raff out and I'd like to thank everybody's kind words on my post. I didn't think this many people would care about adoption.

&amp;#x200B;

we have been foster parents for the last 8 years. We gave up our license after adopting our third child, because three is a lot of kids and we didn't think we could handle more than that. We started fostering, because my wife and I realized we couldn't have kids of our own. We decided to foster, because we wanted to help children that were relatively local to us. This isn't to say that we view adopting from overseas as better or worse; it's just different. In many ways, adopting overseas would have been easier, because the fostering/adoption process was not smooth (apparently it never is, but nobody tells you that).

&amp;#x200B;

We adopted my oldest (6) about two and a half years ago, that process took 9 months after we were told we would be able to adopt her. We adopted the other two (3 &amp; 4) in April and that process took about a year and a half to finalize.

&amp;#x200B;

My experience is not everybody's so your mileage may vary. I live in Illinois, so my experience is just from that, but I think a lot of US states have similar laws. For obvious reasons, I may not be able to answer everybody's questions due to confidentiality, but I will do my best.

&amp;#x200B;

If you are thinking about fostering or adopting, please talk to your local agency about it. There is no commitment if you talk to them about what everything entails. Over the years, I've heard ""I couldn't foster, because I would love the kids too much and I couldn't let them go."" I have poured my heart and soul into every kid that has come into my house even if it was only for a few months."
