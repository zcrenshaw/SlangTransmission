"I dated a pornstar for about a year. AMA


Thought this would be an interesting idea after having a conversation with a fellow redditor. Didn't know if anyone was curious on what that experience was like.

"I'm a Venezuelan citizen living the biggest blackout in the history of our country. AMA!


My name is Julio Alfonzo, I'm a 22 years old Stand-Up comedian living in Venezuela and I'm currently in the middle of the chaos caused by the biggest blackout in our country's history. If you don't know anything about it, [you can read a report here.](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/mar/10/venezuela-blackout-day-four-maduro-fear-anger) I almost ran out of food, water is scarcing and local markets are only accepting dollars as a payment option, largely due to the national bank system going down after the power outage. After four days without internet, data or power in my phone, the electricity returned. I don't know how long this is going to last, but you're welcome to ask me o say anything that might distract me from this bullshit situation I'm living. Go ahead!

"I am a nurse who assisted in the delivery of a 20 pound baby. AMA.


  

Just a bit of background: As part of a nursing and midwifery internship program, I spent 8 weeks oversees working at a hospital. The physician I was assigned to dealt mainly with high risk pregnancies. This particular patient had a baby that was large for gestational age (LGA). Prior to the delivery date, we had urged the patient for an elective cesarean section, as we predicted the baby would be between 12-13 pounds. She was quite adamant about having a natural delivery, so she refused. She also declined an epidural or any pain management.

At the onset of her labor, we had given her a mixture of oxygen and gas to alleviate anxiety, as her contractions were quite strong. She endured a prolonged second stage of labor and our team grew concerned. Unfortunately, due to the baby’s size and position, we could not perform an emergency c-section, episiotomy, or administer an epidural.

Given the situation, the physician elected to end the delivery quickly using a vacuum. The patient sustained a few moments of agony, and the baby was successfully delivered. When we weighed him, we recorded a birthweight of 20 lbs, 2 oz (9.128 kg) which was completely unprecedented at the hospital. 

We had recorded the delivery for internal use and teaching; however, she gave us permission to share with the public if we wished to, as long as we didn’t disclose any identifying information (names, locations, etc.).

"Selling books on amazon now pays for my life. AMA


After 8 months of trying to figure it out, my team and I just finished our first $50k month selling books on amazon.  

Aiming at $750k-1mm total for 2019 

Here’s a rough map of our business model:

100% books; 100% fba 
Processing three 18-wheelers a month (~155 Gaylord boxes) with 4-5 people.

18-wheeler all in cost - $1,765 ($.044/lb @ 40,000lbs)
Labor for one 18-wheeler - $450 
Rent @ 2,000sqft -  $2,000/mo
Trash removal $500 per 18-wheeler processed

Getting about 1,850 fba books on avg per trailer. 

Per 18-wheeler we also sell ~25,000lbs to a 3rd party buyer @ $.06/lb + $16 per skid (Gaylord) @ 32 pallets for about $2k/ trailer

Average sale price per book is ~$12.50 on a rolling basis. 

We pull around $400-500 per trailer in cds, dvds, and vinyl on buyback sites and other channels

Amazon payout margin 33% (that is, for the $50k sales amazon paid us $16,500 to our business account)

Gross profit after secondary revenue 47% (that is, in addition to the $16k received we received $8k from the third party)

Books sold for the month: 3860
Avg payout to business acct per book sold: $4.27


As of last week we’ve begun processing ~20 boxes a day as opposed to the 10-12 a day we normally do so now we’ll hit a cash flow issue in a few weeks. But we just recently got an investing solution, so that we maintain this production level without much cost on our end, even considering repayments.

"I am a sex trafficking survivor AMA


Hello!

First post on this account, I have an account I am active on but I'd prefer not to make this public to people that I know.

I am a sex trafficking survivor, I was trafficked in the UK from the age of 13 until I was 20 with multiple other girls. I was forced to have sex with multiple men for money daily and forced to perform in pornographic photos/videos which were then sold. 

I am now 27, it has been 7 years since I managed to escape this life. I have a degree and I am married to an amazing and supportive man. It has been a long and hard road. For a while, I felt ashamed and disgusted with myself for what I had done. I attempted suicide 3 times over 2 years. With intensive therapy, I have learnt to embrace my title as a survivor and realise that I did nothing wrong. I regularly speak to schools about sex trafficking and I volunteer for a rape crisis helpline. Helping people who have been through similar experiences has helped me massively. 

During the 7 years, I fell pregnant 4 times as I was forced to engage in unprotected sex. I had two daughters, one miscarriage and one forced abortion.
