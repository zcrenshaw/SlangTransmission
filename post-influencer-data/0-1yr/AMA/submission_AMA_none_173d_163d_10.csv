"27 years ago I was internally decapitated (occipital dislocation) and dead for 11 minutes. Ask Me Anything!


When I was 6 years old, I was crossing a rural street to get to my friends house (in the company of said friend and our older brothers). I was hit by a car going 75mph - my body was tossed over 150ft down the road. My right leg had 50 different breaks and fractures, my growth plates were pulled away from the bone, I suffered a minor stroke, lost the use of 1 vocal cord, and endured an occipital dislocation (internal decapitation). I was airlifted to the Harborview Trauma Center in Seattle, and was one of the first patients to successfully undergo an occipital fusion - a bone was taken from my hip and used to wire/graft my neck and spine together. 

I spent 21 days in ICU, had to learn to eat, talk, and walk all over again. I have a condition similar to cerebral palsy, I am now a 33 year old woman, still dealing with the effects of traumatic brain injury and various other ailments. "

"I'm the guy watching you on CCTV when you go out in public. Ask Me Anything.


You've all seen me. Well, not me per se, but you've seen my eyes, at least some of them.

Maybe you've sheepishly made brief eye contact with me, wondering if I can see you holding that necklace you're thinking of stealing. Maybe you've devised clever plots to hide from me, or even blind me. Or maybe you just never gave me a second thought.

I've  seen the best in people, I've seen the worst in people. I've seen some dumb shit, and I've seen some crazy shit. Every now and then I see some literal shit. I have witnessed senseless acts of violence, I have witnessed traumatic injuries, I have witnessed people driven to the brink of suicide.

Now is your chance to get the answers to all those nagging questions you get every time you look into one of my eyes."

"I’ve been a high school janitor for 3 years, AMA.


I’m going into the navy and would love to answer questions about my current job. 

We always see the “ RIP janitor “ on posts with a mess but most of the time when I see those I think “ ah, that’d take me 4 mins or less” so it inspired me to see what the community has to ask. 

PSA: it’s not as difficult or nasty as people think it is."
