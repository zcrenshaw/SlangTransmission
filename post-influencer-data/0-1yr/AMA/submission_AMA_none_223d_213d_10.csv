"I accidentally found myself in a karma scandal worth 36 thousand upvotes. Oops. AMA.


I made a post yesterday in r/NintendoSwitch being a shitty satire on another post which was giving away a free switch digital game code. I claimed I would give away 2 free codes. This was a lie. Went to bed with about 6 upvotes, wake up with 36.1k.

I was invited to three premium Reddit clubs, awarded Platinum 4 times, gold twice. And now I'm trying to give it all back. Ask me anything."

"I'm an online editor-in-chief who got fired today. ""Cost cuts"". In two and a half years, I managed to make the website jump from 50 k page views to 3 million a month. I also saw the company drop 2/3 of its staff. So I know a thing or two about the great media crisis, clickbait, Facebook etc. AMA.


Some info: I'm not from the United States and maybe the media crisis here is even worse. I won't reveal the country for my privacy and because that can derail the conversation. It's a print and web publishing company, making magazines. When I joined, in November 2016, it had 12 titles. Now it has 4 - if it won't close mine, which seems likely. They even removed the coffee machines. My publication was a popular History magazine, covering both oddities and serious themes (factual when talking about funny stuff; no sensationalist bullshit, like aliens making the pyramids). Still I had to make the audience grow and managed. All for nothing: with 3 million page views, the site still didn't cover my salary (which was bellow market rate). "

"I was almost a school shooter AMA


Throwaway account.

Alright, for starters, I'm currently a high school student. I live in the Philippines together with my mom and brother. My father died when I was a kid, so I never really had a father figure growing up. 

But this isn't about them. This is about me. 

There aren't a lot of shooters from Southeast Asia, and I'm pretty aware of that. But luckily, I didn't end up that way. 

I was heavily bullied throughout my childhood. Everyday was torment. People would order and push me around. They called me names. I was known as the classroom dork. I was a loner, and didn't have much friends. When I graduated elementary, I thought that would be the end of that. But guess what? The bullying never stopped until I reached 10th grade. I'm doing well now. I have a group of friends, and they've been really supportive. Basically, I'm as happy as I can be right now. 

It happened back in 8th grade. The teacher was absent, and it was our last period, so we had a lot of free time. I was sitting alone by the corner, fiddling with my phone, when this kid came up and snatched it from my hands. I told him to give it back, but they just laughed. He pulled me up, and these two guys grabbed my arm as this other guy stuffed my head inside a cellophane. I was thrashing, screaming, telling them to stop, but they treated it like it was a joke. I was choking, but I guess they didn't hear it. The whole class eventually settled us down, and the guys pushed me to the ground. Keep in mind, I was a really small guy back then, and I was easily pushed around. Hell, I didn't even know how to punch. 

Some students helped me up, comforted me, while the rest of them were yelling at the guys who beat me up, threatening them to tell our class advisor about what happened. I don't remember much, but I do remember crying a lot. Then that crying turned to anger. And that anger turned to this burning rage. Then I thought, ""that's it, I'm gonna fucking kill them."" 

I remembered that my mom had a pistol she kept to herself for protection. She didn't have a license, so she kept it hidden. But I knew that she kept it inside her cabinet. And it all escalated from there. That night, I crept in inside her room, grabbed the gun, and went back to my room quietly. 

I remember looking at myself in the mirror with the gun in my hand. I remember practicing my stare. I remember pointing the gun at my reflection. I remember making a short bang as I made a mock shooting attempt. I knew I what I was gonna do. I knew it was wrong, but I didn't care. I counted the bullets. I don't remember how many there were, but I remember making a mental list on who I will plant them into. I put the gun in my bag before going to sleep.

I went to the next day with one thought in mind. I wanted to make a lasting impression. I wanted to kill them. And after that, I would kill myself. It was during our Math class when I realized what I was doing. And in that moment, I realized what kind of effect it would bring to my family. My mom, my brother, everyone. I didn't want to hurt them. I looked towards the group of guys who beat me up yesterday and thought of how their families would react. How their friends would react. Then I thought about my dad. This isn't the man he wanted me to be. This isn't who I am, and he knows it. I knew it. 

Questions began flooding in. 

Am I seriously gonna kill them all and ruin the lives of their families just for the sake of revenge? Am I seriously gonna kill a room full of innocent teens who still have their lives to live? These questions went on and on, until I just shook my head and said; ""Nope. Not gonna do it."" 

I put the gun away as soon as I got home. I hugged my mom and told her how much she meant to me. She was pretty confused, but I didn't want to explain the whole ordeal to her, so I never said anything. I never told anyone for that matter. Well, until now. 

Anyways, yes, what I did was wrong. I was a pretty edgy kid, I'd admit, but I'm not a bad person. Just got fed up from all the bullying I've gotten. Do I regret it? Absolutely. Was it worth it? Definitely not. Will I do it again? Never

So I'm gonna tell this thing I've learned. Yes, it does get better. Don't give up. Don't be like me. I was weak. I went with the easy way out, and let me tell you that it isn't worth it. Life is hard, but don't let it push you over the edge. Everytime life tells you you can't, punch him in the face and prove him wrong. Because you can be so more than what society views you as. Keep living. Keep fighting. And don't ever ever give up. 

Ask me anything. I'll try to answer all your questions. 

(p.s sorry for my terrible English. I'm in a hurry rn, and I'm typing this on my phone. I hope you guys understand)
