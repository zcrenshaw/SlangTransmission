"I found my kidnapped friends in China, and am now fighting human trafficking - AMA!


You might remember my 2016 AMA about my three teenaged friends who were kidnapped from Vietnam and trafficked into China. They were ""lucky"" to be forced into marriage, not prostitution. 

One of my friends escaped her ""husband"", and was brought home safely. The other two just disappeared - I didn't know where they were, what had happened to them, or even if they were still alive. 

I gave up everything to investigate their disappearances, and risked my life to find them in China. After 5 months of searching, to everyone's surprise (including my own!), I did actually find them. 

It was more than I'd ever hoped for, but that was just the beginning. Both of my friends had given birth in China, and each faced a heartbreaking dilemma: the choice between her daughter and her own freedom. 

We're now launching our award-winning documentary on the girls' story to raise awareness of the global human trafficking crisis and to help protect vulnerable girls in Vietnam. 

PROOF: You can find proof (and more information) on the front page of our website at: [http://www.humanearth.net](http://www.humanearth.net) 

We're running a crowdfunding campaign to continue our anti-trafficking work. You can now see the film and support our work at [http://www.sistersforsale.com](http://www.sistersforsale.com)

I'll be here for at least two hours, and might stay longer depending how many questions there are. Last time the response was a little overwhelming, this time /u/clydebsfinalrepose is also here to help out if necessary."

"i was addicted to opioids from ages 15-18, overdosed at 18, spent 3 days at a hospital, &amp; 2 and a half weeks in a mental hospital during thanksgiving. my family cut ties with me, and iâ€™m now living with my doggo in a studio apartment working 3 jobs and finally getting my diploma in August. AMA!


iâ€™m not sensitive about the topic at all now, and am open to sharing almost anything about my experiences in the hospitals, before the hospitals, or where i am today! 

i think itâ€™s important that these topics are addressed transparently, as addiction are not uncommon, and many need support and to feel that theyâ€™re not alone. ask me *anything* :)"

"Ask a homeless guy


Hey, I'm a homeless ex drug addict. I live in a fucking tent, in the hell hole that is Seattle Washington. Ask me questions if you'd like my unique and twisted opinion. I'd appreciate it if you would be respectful, or I might just go out and abduct a small child...I'M KIDDING!!! I don't mind if you ask weird questions, as long as they are serious. ðŸ–•ðŸ¤˜"

"AMA: I recently became a professional cuddler


Hey friends! In my search for more sacred touch in my life, I have recently (as of this month) decided to become a professional cuddler. I take private clients at my house where we converted a bedroom into a cuddle room complete with an altar and a king-sized mattress on the floor that acts as a cozy lounge space. 

I want to get the word out that cuddling is an available therapeutic service for people who know they need touch and authentic intimacy, so bring on your questions! I would love to demystify this practice. :)"
