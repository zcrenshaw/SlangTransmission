"12 Years Cancer Free


Today I am 12 years cancer free. 

I got diagnosed with metastatic testicular cancer on October 12, 2006. Two weeks later I had an aneurysm and woke up in the hospital not able to walk or talk. I had to relearn how to both. After wards I had to do 5 days straight of 9 hrs of chemo every third week.  Followed by a month of full brain radiation. 

For those of you who have been diagnosed with cancer, or are living with someone with cancer, or been told it has gone into remission and have questions and/or you just want to share your stories I invite you to share them here. 

Dont know if this is the correct r/ but I don't generally post often on here so forgive me. "
"I am Iroquois nation descended, Mohawk native, and my name is Karoniekens. AMA


I absolutely love spreading awareness and knowledge about my culture; especially now when pop culture has been idolizing the native plight. Many people claim that they are native when they are not, and this can be easily determined with a few simple questions versus a whole DNA test. You won't even be recognized as being native without meeting the requirements of your birthright even if you do have some percentage of DNA. 


Common stories are that people are related to native American shamans or native American princesses. Allow me to help you understand the reality of our culture and how to spot fakers that you might encounter. Preserving our lineage and culture is so important to us. 

I would also love to talk about our history, even more specifically of the Mohawk nation. Ask me anything!"

Been working for facebook under a contractor for the last 9 months, it's been rough at times. I can verify that what the vouch said is somewhat accurate.

Technically I'm not supposed to speak about it but fuck it.

I can pm mods a photo of my fb badge and further verification. Never done one of these before. "
"I'm a 21F and have been totally blind since 3 years old. AMA


I went blind at 3 due to cancer. I've lived independently, have a cat, and I was a junior in uni last semester but am now on a break due to moving.

There are many misconceptions about blind people and the way we live our lives. No question is too personal or offensive; ask away!

"I am a 23/F living with 2 incurable STDs. AMA!


Hi all! 

As the title states, I am a 23/F currently living with 2 STDs. I contracted GHSV1 5 years ago from my second ever bf. He had cold sores and I never knew until one day I had one down below. It never affected my life in any way because I never have had another OB, until we split about a year and a half ago. Since then, I’ve been with about 4 guys, one of which cared and rejected me due to my HSV1. Recently, about a month ago, I was also diagnosed with HPV, the genital warts kind. I was upset at first because I’ve always used protection, had my vaccines, didn’t know who gave it to me, but through supportive doctors and family/friends I’ve been okay. 

If anything, I want this post to bring awareness to the subject of STDs. I think the stigma behind them is what makes them so “bad”. The statistics are crazy for how many people out there are living with things like this, yet no one ever talks about it. I would hope that people don’t make assumptions or judge me for this, but I understand. Before I got these 2 things I definitely judged others living with them. AMA!! 

TL;DR I am a 23/F living with 2 STDs. Let’s bring awareness to this topic and end the stigma! "
