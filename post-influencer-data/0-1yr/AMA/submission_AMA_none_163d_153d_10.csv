"Hi, I'm Jerry, President and CEO of TakeAway Tables. I just regained control of my company after being declared dead for 15 months. Ask me anything!


Hi, fellow Redditors! Just as the title says...my father passed away at Thanksgiving of 2017 from a ruptured aneurysm. Before we could even send him to his final rest, I was declared deceased instead of my father. The agency that made the error then reported the death to other agencies and within days, I was officially deceased everywhere. My passport was no longer valid, my driver's license was no longer valid, and creditors began calling on my ""estate"" for repayment of debt. I could not travel, execute financial transactions, or conduct business. After 15 months of lawsuits and unimaginable stress, I have been revived and am again amongst the living! I just regained control of my company and invite you to AMA about the journey!"

What is OUAS?

Once Upon A Saga is a complicated logistical challenge of historical proportions! It also has great humanitarian value and is a source of inspiration for many.

In short, the ""Saga"" is the quest for one man to reach every single country in the World in a single unbroken journey - completely without the use of flight! Although the World has been conquered geographically by travellers many times throughout history, a completely flightless journey is a feat that has never before been achieved...until now.

In order to understand the ""Saga"" better it can be seen as three individual projects:

1)
A journey to every country without flight with all of its complicated logistics (203 countries). This is a World Record attempt.

2)
A positive promotion of each country sharing stories of positive experiences to counter the negatives we see in the media (203 countries). 

3)
A positive promotion of the Red Cross Red Crescent movement which was founded in 1863 and today spans across 191 nations. I'm honored to travel as Goodwill Ambassador of the Danish Red Cross.

As such, the Saga is known to provide three elements for those who partake:
- Inspiration
- Motivation
- Education 
- Entertainment

So, join me on the journey by spreading the word, that A STRANGER IS A FRIEND YOU'VE NEVER MET BEFORE! ;)

"Ive been in the bathroom for over 7 hours now (and counting) having uncontrolled diarrhea and vomiting at the same time. AMA!


Im the third person in my family in the last week to catch this stomach bug. First my father in law, then wife, now me. It started off with some stomach grumbles around 730pm. It is now 3:16am and im still having liquid come out of my butt. I have absolutely no warning at all, it's just like my body is turning on a faucet. Ive had two episodes of vomiting, both times puking about 4 times in the span of 30 seconds. I now know what it's like to have puke come straight out of your nostrils. 

Fun fact: macaroni noodles apparently take longer than 12 hours to digest because those puppies were still completely full noodle."

"Ran away from home, went through every kind of abuse from everybody in my life, was in a psychiatrist institution against my will, attempted suicide many times and never loved


So yeah, I don't know how to start this because every single bit of this story is fucked up. I decided to share it so that if there's anyone facing anything similar to anything that I have written, they can contact me and I promise to help however I can.

Lets start from the beginning!

I was born with a very rare syndrome called crouzon, diagnosed when I was 2, had almost 20 surgeries until the age of 14 because of it. Because of this syndrome, I'm deaf and almost half blind. This syndrome made me look different as a child. It's not like I has 3 eyes or something, I just looked strange. My eyes were popping out of my head, I couldn't close my mouth because my upper jaw was wayyyyy more forward than the bottom jaw, and I had very short hair because my parents made me shave it before every surgery. So basically my entire elementary school made fun of me and beat me up. At home my parents hit me too, and my little sister who was a year younger than me used to also hit and scratch me for no reason and wouldn't get anything for that. I remember my arms were always bloody and bruised. Around grade 4 I just stopped talking at all. Never said a word.

Then I finished elementary school. Finally. My family and I moved to Germany because of my father's job and I hoped for a new beginning. First day people got really excited about me, because I was from a different country, and a new student, but I went to an international school so it wasn't very unusual to have students from different countries. I still couldn't talk and spent breaks in the bathroom alone, including lunch because I had no one to sit with and I felt ugly anyway, so i thought it would also help me get skinnier and stuff. Around the same time my mother used to take away my plate whenever I ate something, saying that I was ""too fat"". She didn't know I was already starving myself (and no, I was never overweight in my entire life. I was underweight as a result of those years). Anyway, people made fun of me at school and no one actually noticed me, all the usual stuff.

Then the interesting part begins.
In grade 8th I started being sexually abused by my father. I didn't know it was wrong. I remember looking at other girls at my school and thinking, how they could stay sane in a world like this? I thought this was happening to everybody. I always had a feeling something was off, but you never think something like that could ever happen to you until it does, and then you cannot process it by yourself at all.

Anyway, I came back to my home country for the summer, and stayed at my grandma's. I asked to sleep with her in her bed so that he wouldn't come at nights. Then she started questioning me every night. I lied at first, because I knew that once I say something my life will fall apart completely. Then she said that if I don't tell her, he'll do the same to my sister. And then I started crying.

The next morning I remember my mother woke me up screaming, how could I say such a lie. My whole family hated me for ""lying"", and my father also said I was lying. My grandmother is the only one who believed me. So we went to do a polygraph. We got the results like two hours later, and my mother found out I didn't lie. Then she made all of us swear to keep it quiet.

I was sexually and physically abused all the time until the first time I ran away from home. I cried and told my principal about it after she caught me skipping school for about half a year. She made me write it down and contacted the child protection service of Germany (did I say that correctly?). The same day I was sent to a safe house for teenage girls and stayed there for two months until my parents got a lawyer and took me back. I never left my room in the safe house and spent my time reading and sleeping. I also didn't speak German and they didn't speak English, so it was kinda hard to communicate as well.

I continued skipping school, and failing classes, until I eventually had to repeat 8th grade. Not much has changed besides the fact that I was forced to take pills.

Two years later I found myself too scared to go home after a fight with my mother. I decided to take the chance and see my psychologist and ask her to send me to a mental institution. I was taken there by an ambulance. I was promised that they'll let me go two days later, but they didn't. I was forced to stay there for almost three months, until my parents took me out because school &gt; my mental health. It was winter break so they didn't have a problem with me staying there for the entire break.

In the free time I started doing drugs, drinking and smoking with my roommate. Once we ran away from the hospital as well. We walked through fields, and on the sides of the roads, and through forests which was very cool. We didn't know where we were going. We just went wherever we felt like we wanted to go. The same day I was taken home and she was taken back to the hospital. I didn't have my stuff or anything because my mother refused to let me get my stuff. My family also didn't visit me for the first two weeks.

Half a year later we returned to my home country. My mother went completely insane. She became a real monster. Im too lazy to write about how bad she became, but it became worse. She spat, cursed more, hit more, and told me stuff like no one would miss me if I was gone and that I should just disappear.

On December 2019 (the exact same date of the first time I ran away from home) I ran away again. I went to a safe house for teenagers with problems at home. It wasn't always abuse, but most of them were abused. For example, I had a roommate whose brother stabbed her, and another roommate whose mother died and she wasn't in contact with her father. So you get the point.

A couple months later I decided to leave and start living with my grandmother. My mother still doesn't talk to me and when she does she makes fun of my low eq (I also had a psychological diagnoses and the results said that my eq is much lower than the average but my iq is much higher which kinda surprised me) and my sister hates me, but that's okay. I did what's best for me and I will not apologize for trying to have a better life and improving myself. My grandmother makes me take all of my pills (20 mg cipralex, 50 mg trazodil, b12, and iron because I'm severely anemic) all the time, eat 3 times a day, and sleep normally, which is nice.

So that's me. Ask me anything! And don't be afraid to contact me for help or anybody else!
If you're going through anything even a little bit similar, or anything at all, please contact me or someone who can help you!"
