"Hi! I'm a 23-year-old woman who accidentally drove of a 200+ ft cliff &amp; survived alone at the bottom for 7 days. AMA!


Hey! 

My name is Angela Hernandez.
On July 6th, 2018, I was driving south on the Pacific Coast Highway. I was driving from Portland, OR to Southern California. 
When I was in Big Sur, CA, a small animal stepped onto the road causing me to swerve, which sent my car down a 200+ cliff and into the water. 

I was at the bottom of the cliff for a total of 7 days. 

I recounted my misadventure in a detailed facebook post that you can read here: 
https://m.facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=863966753796017&amp;id=100005481015477

Long story short, the crash caused me to experience a brain hemorrhage for the first few days, break &amp; fracture both collar bones, fracture 4 ribs, and experience intense sunburns on my hands, feet, &amp; face. 

I went without water for the first few days until finding a patch of moss that dripped fresh water from the top of the cliff. I used the radiator hose, which had fallen off of my vehicle, to collect water. 

On the 7th day, right before sunset, I spotted an adventurous couple walking across the beach. They contacted nearby officials and I was lifted up the cliff using ropes and then airlifted to a nearby hospital where I was reunited with my family. 


It was the craziest week of my entire life! Anyway, yeah! Ask me anything!"
"I just had my Sushi stolen by the delivery guy using UberEats, AMA


That's right, i had my sushi stolen and i am feeling very sad right now.   


I ordered it at 2:36 PM (Sydney time) and the guy whose name i have memorized in my head went into a corner street, and did nothing for 30 minutes, i imagine he was snacking on my sushi.  


Called customer service and they told me that he said that he would deliver it within 5 minutes. 5 minutes later, he cancels the order. I call customer service back.  


They say that he said the food was damaged and i am getting a $10 voucher on my next order and my refund will take up to 2 weeks to go through.  

 
In other words i am at a loss of $40 and i have no sushi.

"I live in a multigenerational house with our 2 kids, husband, and mother-in-law. It was supposed to be temporary. Its been 5 years and working out great. Zero regrets. AMA


I'm 33, my children are 7 and 5. My MIL moved in originally to help after my son (then 2) was diagnosed disabled. She is a physically healthy, motivated, and patient woman. 

Fast forward to last year, I was diagnosed with terminal  cancer and life changed completely. Because of my MIL already living with us, our kids and my husband have had extra support in cooking, cleaning, appts, bills with hardly any transition.  This women has been to every doctors appointment with me so my husband can still work. 

I feel like my life is the best it possible could be, all because I was open minded enough to accept my in law's help raising our son.
