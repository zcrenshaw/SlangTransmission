"I am a father that lost his only son to suicide. AMA


It has been over 3 years now and I still feel crushed every year on Father’s Day. Help me make it through the day by having me answer your dad questions that you either can’t ask, or don’t want to ask your own dad.

Thanks,

"How planning to kill myself next year ended up saving my life [30F] AMA


I just wanted to share my story because I think it could help someone 

So I’m a [30F] and I went on the pill last year for my iron. It ended up dramatically shifting my hormones so much that I got really depressed and my thinking for really dark which is extremely out of character for me. 

A bit about me - I have a masters, an amazing career where I earn above market rate, I love my job, my boss loves my work, I have tonnes of friends and can be a lot of fun- I’m the funny one and the one you go to for help. And I’ve been single for a really long time, but have been online dating and had a fwb who didn’t treat me well (and face it no guy I’ve been with has been kind), but I also didn’t think I deserved to be treated better either, so I put up with a lot.  I honestly have never felt loved by anyone and I so desperately just wanted to love someone but I just couldn’t see anyone wanting to be with me. 

The pill made me feel my loneliness and sadness so much more intensely than I have ever felt darkness before. I was crying everyday. I kept it together st work by listening to music through headphones as loud as I could to stay as distracted from my thoughts. And this was my default to stop myself bursting into tears all the time. I’m not a crier so this was really frustrating for me. 

After 7-8 months on the pill. I decided that  I was sick of my life being in the same year in and year out whilst everyone was growing and moving on. And if by March next year nothing had changed and I was in the same place for yet another year in a row like it had been for a good part of a decade then I was ending it. 

I talked to a lawyer, I started to get my affairs in order, insurance, debt, all the little details. And decided I was going to work like hell to save as much as I could so I could help my friends and family as much as I could. I worked out more because I felt like I didn’t want people to think my life was in stand still because I was unfit or overweight and depressed because of that. Because i wasn’t. I’m happy in my skin.  I became more social because my count down was on. I had one year to make the most of my friends because next year I will be gone. 

I planned a holiday. I was going to do it overseas, so I stayed to decide where I was going to visit. Maybe meet some online friends for the first time (if they were crazy it didn’t matter, the end goal was to die anyway)  and do a few last bucket list things.

But here’s the thing. The more I put things in order for my death. The less stressed I felt. I felt more in control of my life than I ever had before. 

And I started feeling happier. 

After seeing my savings grow all of a sudden I realised owning a house is actually within grasp. It’s not a hopeless cause.  I’m now in control of my finances and they’re thriving. 

My social life is amazing because I’m putting my energy into other people. My friendships are under control and thriving 

My fitness has improved. I’ve lost 8kgs, running 10kms reg with a new group every week. I’m looking cuter and getting lots of compliments. My health is under control and thriving. 

I haven’t been on the pill for 3 months. I’m managing my iron other ways and I’m no longer crying, or depressed. My mental health is under control and thriving. 

My perspectives of things changed. I started seeing things through the lens of “is this going to matter April 2020”? No? Don’t stress about it.   So my confidence grew - if something was shit st work i stood up for myself. I got more responsibilities and a pay rise. Because I wasn’t afraid anymore. Because what was stressing me out stopped being AS important. I’m in control of what happens to me in my career and it’s thriving - I have more opportunity than ever before. 

This is my favourite bit. 
I met someone. We have been dating for just over a month. There’s real potential here but I’ve met someone that could become my best friend. He respects me and cares about me. He is interesting and hes interested in me. Helps me, supports me, compliments me. He is doing everything he can to show he thinks the world of me. Everyday he tells me how awesome he thinks I am. I’m so blessed. I have someone who will hold me and hug me and I know he has my back. I’m finally safe. 

I haven’t ever had this my entire life. No guy has treated me so kindly before I can barely process how great it is. I don’t know how it happened. I was going to kill myself I was so convinced it was never going to happen. And out of the blue it did. 

If you’re close to giving up. Trust me. I GET IT. 
But please don’t. Your life can turn around in a MOMENT. 7 weeks ago I was THE BIGGEST skeptic out there.... and now I can’t imagine not being here for what else life has for me. I got dealt a rough hand of cards in my life, but it’s turned around in a heartbeat. It’s going to be ok. You’re going to be ok."
