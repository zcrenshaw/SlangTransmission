(Repost, first one messed up)

Hey! I’m Corbin. I don’t have any proof to show you, so I guess you’ll just have to take my word for this.

A couple years back I was studying to be a teacher, and they would have me go into classrooms and watch the teacher’s teach. (I ended up studying business management instead, and am soon to graduate.)

Anyways, in the class was a 12 year old boy who was really quiet. He made C’s and D’s and seemed to really struggle. I started to help him with his work, and soon began tutoring him after school. He eventually opened up to me and said his dad had recently left and his mom started heavily drinking, and they were close to losing their house.

I felt really sorry for him but at the time, I didn’t have any money so I couldn’t do anything except say I was sorry to hear that.

Fast forward to the next school year (7th grade), I don’t go to the school and watch the teacher’s anymore, but I would still tutor him in the library. He missed two lessons in a row (we did two each week) and I asked his homeroom teacher where he was. He had been taken away by CPS because his mom had started abusing him. He had been placed in foster care.

My heart broke, I almost started crying. I felt almost guilty because he had told me he looks forward to seeing me, even though I had nothing to do with it I felt guilty.

I don’t feel like explaining all the court stuff, paperwork, etc, but fast forward a year (7 months ago now) and the adoption process started.

After court visits, lots of paperwork, saving up money, and a lot of stress, last week he’s finally mine.

He’s 14 now, very healthy and happy. He can call his mother once a week (court orders) and he has tried calling his father, but no answer.

He likes skateboarding, and we both enjoy baseball.

So, with all that being said, AMA!"

"I was born with two failing kidneys, a solid vagina and crossed paths with ovarian cancer. AMA!


Hi all. My name is Amanda and here is my story. I just posted on IAmA and thought it was going swimmingly until I learned I didn’t provide adequate proof in time. Nor did I understand the subreddit. Oops. I was born in 1990 and all seemed well until I fell very sick. Here is my story. In 1992 I ended up needing a kidney transplant from my mother due to interstitial nephritis. My Kidneys were not functioning properly and my mom got tested for compatibility. She ended up being a 5/6 which was good news! Parents are typically about a 3/6. The local hospital we had been staying at couldn’t handle the transplant in 1992 and sent us to Children’s Mercy West in Kansas City. I was their first transplant on a baby. The human body really is quite fascinating! As an adult, my mother’s kidney was adult sized and I was a small, petite and sickly two year old. After being transplanted into my body her kidney shrank back down and then regrew again through all of it’s stages with me. We were told it would work for approximately three years. Medicines were pretty harsh and Prograf and Cellcept weren’t around. It ended up working for 16 years because I am half made of kryptonite and plain awesome. Jokes! Note: they attempted to actually do this surgery three times. One time they opened her up, I sneezed and they called it off. Third time was the charm. Anyways, it worked 16 years.

That put me summertime, right before my senior year it failed. My dad and mom decided my dad would be my donor so my two elder siblings didn’t have to be tested nor worry about donating a kidney. That man and idol half killed himself to donate his kidney to me. They put him through a million tests. One was blood sugars. He knew he was diabetic but also knew I had to have a kidney. At the hospital they gave him a sugary drink and then he had to drink it there and come back in an hour to test his levels. This was for his safety to donate which wasn’t his priority. After drinking the drink he left the hospital and stuck his fingers down his throat and forced himself to purge the “drink”.. literally popped a blood vessel in his eye. It was snowing heavily out so he walked six miles and started shoveling random driveways around the hospital for an hour to make sure he would pass. He did. Also lost about thirty pounds that the doctors said he would need to lose to donate. He wasn’t obese or anything but slightly heavier than the “average” on their charts. They had checked if we were a match and we were a 3/6.. typical parental match with zero antibodies. They scheduled a date for the transplant and we drove down the night before to check in and stay the night. 6AM came early and I hadn’t eaten in forever but hey, I was gaining a healthy kidney. The nurse came in and said that she had to draw both our blood samples one last time before surgery. We had done it already like ten times over the last six months so wasn’t a big deal. The nurse said it was just to double check that I have no antibodies against him. I asked what were the chances that I would develop them overnight.. she said in the 25 years she had been there she had never seen it. 

Well, you guessed it. I had developed antibodies against my dad overnight since they had taken our blood the night before and he could no longer donate. It meant I would reject his kidney and it simply was no longer an option. Not often had I seen my dad cry but that was one of them. I did too. My high school friends had decorated the house for me to come home too so my mom quickly sent them a text and they ran over and undecorated the house. This meant my siblings would have to be tested. I will never forget the night before my college freshman brother’s lab draw. We spent most of the evening pacing the kitchen and living room floor. He asked me probably 100 plus questions about what it would be like. Genuinely terrified of something I did once a month my whole life and weekly during certain spurts. Take this in your pocket to remind yourself that just because someone’s fear may be silly or insignificant to you does not make their problem any less real or scary to them. Always show comfort and understanding the way you want it when you feel scared. Life hurdles simply are not a competition. My sister tested from Florida where she lived with her husband, she was five years older than myself. I went with my brother and he survived his testing bravely. The results showed I had antibodies against my brother but not my sister. They were both a 6/6 in match but my brother’s would be rejected. That meant my sister was the lucky winner. She graciously donated her kidney to me and I still have it to this day at 29 years old. It is quite the trooper. 

Now. Why you are really here. It started in the 8th grade. I had started my period but I did not know it. Over the course of six months I was in excruciating pain, constantly throwing up and my general health was spiraling downward. Finally after six months they saw my uterus was absolutely huge and swollen with six months of period blood. They life watched me due to the poisoning and toxic shock I was ill with. At Children’s Mercy I met the witch of a woman female gyno doctor. She believed that I had a thick hymen. They put me under anesthesia and when I woke my whole family was crying. I did not have a thick hymen, I had vaginal agenesis. We did not know this because naturally I wasn’t sexually active at that age and the outer appearance of my vagina looked completely normal. There were two surgeons in the US that either could or would be able to do my surgery.. maybe because my previous health issues. I am not sure. We traveled to the one and she turned me down. She had done the surgery once before on an 18 year old female who then committed suicide because the physical therapy required was too much. She would not do it on an eight grader, I wouldn’t be mature enough to handle it. Despite having to grow up much earlier in life from my other health issues. We went and saw doctor two.

He was one of the sweetest and most respectful doctors I had ever met. He agreed to do the surgery and advised that I not tell anyone what I was going through. He said in eighth grade your best friend today may not be tomorrow and that kids could make my life complete hell over something like this. I listened. I didn’t tell a soul. My vagina was almost entirely solid. He ordered dilators that I would have to use to stretch the skin up and open inside the vaginal canal. He asked if I was ready and said no one would be able to do it for me or make me do it. He said that if I ever wanted to eventually have my own children I would have to do this. I absolutely have always dreamed of being a mother and so I did it. Twenty minutes, twice daily for five years. They were so incredibly painful that there aren’t really any words. It was like putting a plug into an outlet with no holes because the dilators had to be bigger than what fit as to stretch the canal. Interesting fact. I had to buy an exercise bicycle because the angle of the seat would help me closely create the natural angle of a woman’s vagina. All a lot to think about secretly as an 8th grader. I did my “sticks”, I preferred to call them sticks, for two years until I was a sophomore. At that point I had stretched the vagina canal skin up and open enough that they could do the surgery. They opened it and lay the skin at the top of the vagina like a natural vaginal canal. 

During these two years before they opened the canal what happened with my period and blood? The doctors believed that if I did depo-provera, a birth control shot, every month that I would no longer have a period. The shot was normally given every three months. I went every month because it was critical that I wasn’t ovulating. The doctors also believed that while stopping the blood from continuing and with the shot would allow the blood to re-absorb back into my body basically. This didn’t work. That was discovered after I sat up in bed after surgery and blood gushed out of me. It was insane. It sounded like when you turn your bathtub faucet on to fill the tub. So much blood. Black and smelling of death. The six months of period blood from two years prior could finally exit. I was so stoked to have my period like all my friends. I worked damn hard to be able to use those tampons. My mom and I went out and bought practically every brand of tampon and pad there was.. plum giddy. I had to continue to do the dilators for three years further so it wouldn’t close back down. Still twenty minutes, twice daily. The longest 40 minutes a day of those five years. I remember my junior year and there was this handsome fella I had my eye on. We started dating and I could tell hands were getting adventurous. I am not sure what normally goes through one’s mind then. I was thinking. Oh my goodness!!! I hope it works, I hope it works, I hope it works. Will it feel different? Will he notice? Will it hurt? Well I was his first finger to vagina experience so what the hell I was worried about.. I don’t really know. He wouldn’t have known if I was different. It did indeed work. Not on the orgasmic scale but it was a tunnel and fingers could enter and I was so fucking proud. Can you imagine if I had listened to the first surgeon and waited until 18 or older? That make out session would have turned incredibly awkward on a whole other level.

Fast forward to 2010.. aged 20.

I am dating guy that was mentioned above after we separated when he went off to college and I had a year of high school left. I just moved to be in the same town as him and signed to start cosmetology school in four weeks. We took an eight day vacation to Disney and universal. I was hurting in my abdomen and throwing up randomly. Maybe like twice a day. Not constantly but something felt off. At the end of each day I would throw up and my feet were SO incredibly swollen that clear liquid was leaking out my toe nail beds. I knew I had chronic pain from adhesions from many surgeries and the many meds I took made me nauseous many times than not. Plus I was so focused on making sure my main squeeze was having the vacation of his life. I was determined not to let me be what ruined it for us. We get home and I go to my routine kidney appointment. He pushes on my abdomen and tells me I am not going home. When I would lay flat my stomach was uneven. The right side was raised higher than the left. After surgery they ended up removing a nine pound tumor that had engulfed my ovary. I had no clue I was basically full term pregnant. I will admit Reddit. This one got me. Knocked me down into a dark place. They had removed my left ovary a few years prior due to being damaged from the six months of period blood that had been sitting in my uterus and Fallopian tubes. This meant that I had done those horrible sticks for five years, hand built my own vagina, all so I could have my own kids one day. After a routine appt and a four hour surgery it was just gone. Ended up being ovarian cancer and am all clear and fine today. 

Current life: I have been with said man above for 10 years, married since 2012. We are foster parents to an amazing girl we got at three weeks old. We were wrote to and asked to adopt this little girl by the entire extended family. From May 2018 until March 2019 we thought we were adopting this little girl. Now a grandparent has changed their mind after waiting 18 months. Now we find ourselves in and out of court battling for her. Only time will tell what path we go forward on. One thing is for certain. My husband is a lucky man, after all, he has a one of a kind, hand made vagina. 😉🤷🏼‍♀️😜

TL;DR Had two kidney transplants, vaginal agenesis and ovarian cancer.

Edit** I did tell my first person of the vaginal agenesis when I went to college. Not sure how to explain disappearing everyday twenty minutes, twice a day to a roommate. Just seemed easier to tell the truth."

"BadVolf: whistleblower cop forced to flee to Russia


My name is John Mark Dougan, a former United States Marine and former Deputy Sheriff, now living in Russia for political asylum.

I joined the United States Marine Corps in 1996a nd served four years. First, as a anti-tank infantryman, then a member of a Weapons and Sniper company, where after several meritorious promotions, I became the training Non Commissioned Officer, in charge of training and instruction for water survival, land and ocean navigation, and shooting. I spent the last year competing on the Marine Corps Rifle and Pistol team.

I left the Marine Corps in 1999 with an honorable discharge, and went into business shipping horses all over the United States. I got bored and started a database design company, and then became a Deputy Sheriff at the Palm Beach County Sheriff's Office. As a Deputy Sheriff I did anything from write traffic tickets to chasing murder suspects, and every job in between. Investigations of fraud, burglaries, and because of my military experience, I did surveillance work for the Drug Enforcement Agency to catch some of our most notorious drug dealers. I was on the honorguard, and also was the liason between the technology department and the road patrol units.

I noticed a problem in police work; the fact my collegues were going around, arbitrarily beating black and latin american people, and arresteing them for crimes that were false. I approached my command staff several times, who were well aware of the problems, but looked the other way. After a year of them doing nothing, I brought the problem to the attention to the Palm Beach Post, which demanded an investigation and made the problem public. I was targeted and retaliated against, and I resigned from police work in 2009, and went on to start companies in telecommunications and geospatial data analysis.

I started the web site, PBSOTALK, that allowed good police officers to expose crimes committed by dirty police officer without fear of retaliation. The site was so effective, it led to the exposure, arrest and firings of countless police officers who would have otherwisee been shielded by the Sheriff. I was investigated for eight long years, and in 2015, audio recordings emerged of one of the Sheriff's detectives investigating me, admittedly with help of the FBI. He said their goal was to put me in jail and have me tortured and killed there and to bring down my website.

In 2016, they were one step closer: my home was raided by 45 FBI and Palm Beach County law enforcement agents on the false claim of hacking. They took every digital device from my home, seized money and bank accounts, and planted hidden surveillance equipment in my home. They did not arrest me because they didn't have legitimate charges, because they knew the world was watching. Still, it was only a matter of time after they seized my computers, because recording someone in Florida is a crime. And with me recording the criminal police officers, I was facing 50 years in prison. 

I knew if I stayed, I would never survive until a trial, and I knew I had to excape. I could not leave on an airline because I was put on the Department of Holmend Security's ""No Fly List."" Originally, I was going to sneak out of the country via a boat, but I caught FBI surveillance teams watching me - several times. I came up with a plan to wear a disguise - a blond wig and blue glasses. I took this from my mother's home and went to the mall, where I entered a large, busy store and changed all of my clothing in one of the dressing rooms. I exited from a different direction to an unregistered car that I planned to have waiting for me, and drive north.

I rented a small aircraft to fly me over Canada to take photos and land back in the United States, a route that requires no authorization by the american authorities. But once over Canada, I faked a heart attack over a pre-determined location and landed at a small airstrip. I threw the pilot some money, grabbed my bag and ran through the woods into a nearby town, where I took a bus to Toroto. I flew on Turkish Airlines Moscow, and claimed political asylum.

I landed in Moscow with just $600 in cash, and no working bank cards. I was given help by a woman I knew, and her hisband, a journalist. Things were very dark for me in the beginning, but slowly, I have overcome many challenges and soon hope to get my citizenship. I work doing many different things, and I have many hobbies, but my favorite thing is being able to return the kindness to this country, the way kindness was given to me when I came and had nothing. And so, when I am not working, you can find me volunteering for various charities around Russia and doing what I can to help the most disadvantaged in society - the disabled.

I've had several people ask me to do an ask me anything on this topic, and so here I am. if you want to know the truth about police brutality, if you want to know the truth about racial profiling, if you want to know the truth about why good police officers seemingly don't exist, or even about life in Russia, feel free to ask.
