"Does it bother you that women are very often referred to as girls even in mature and sexual contexts?


I read a comment a short while back where this woman expressed irritation about how grown women are very very often referred to as girls. Now I cannot unsee how often this happens even now as I'm casually watching a streamer who refers to men as men or guys but women as girls all the time. Even when people talk about women in a sexual and mature context they say girls. It surprises me how many people do this, it's so widespread.

The equivalent of boys is girls, the equivalent of guys is girls, the equivalent of men is women. There's not a casual equivalent for grown women like the term ""guys"". Lady, female and even woman sounds very formal and feels unnatural to say. In fact in many cases people use woman only in a negative tone. 

Has anyone else noticed this? Thoughts? Got any similar observations?"
