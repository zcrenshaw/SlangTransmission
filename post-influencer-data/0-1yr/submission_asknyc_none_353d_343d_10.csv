"Does anyone remember a party at the top of the World Trade Center in December of 1985?


In December of 1985 I was invited with my family to attend a 10th birthday bash for The WTC because I was also turning 10 that month/year. It was a big party on a top floor with food and games. I don't remember much else just that we got to go for free because I had the same birthday as the WTC. Although i think the doors opened in 1973 so I'm not sure what this was actually celebrating.  I was wondering if anyone in the reddit-verse remembers this event or has any information on it. THANKS"
"Has anyone every actually used Cellino &amp; Barnes


No one wants Barnes right?"
"Places to sit down and have a fun, non-alcoholic drink


I'm going out with someone tonight around the village who doesn't drink, but I still want it to be a setting where we're sitting and talking with a drink of some sort.

Any suggestions for a place with a fun drink like a milkshake or some kind of juice but is more datey than a health type juice bar?"
"I would like to find an email list or app that alerts me to temporary art exhibits that are in town. Anyone know something like that?


I'd like not miss anything, but I can be bad about scanning Time Out Ny all that often when I get busy. An email with an NYC summary of exhibitions each week or an app that would notify me would be really stellar. I've just learned about a big favorite at the Met in the nick of time, and I can't imagine all the other great stuff that passed through town without me ever knowing. 

Thanks folks!"
