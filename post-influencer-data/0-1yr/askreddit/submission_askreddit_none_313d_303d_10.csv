I think it’s dumb that a diamond ring is the requirement and I think it’s dumb to waste/spend that much money on something that is literally only purely aesthetic and a status symbol  in a society that has already lost its marbles. I just want to marry my girlfriend, but I don’t want to waste 3-5k on a rock when we are both in debt and could use the money, and I don’t want to wait until we are at a financial situation to be able to waste that much money to propose.. this is ridiculous.
