"TIFU by throwing away a winning scratch card


Mandatory it didn't happen today, but in Summer a year ago. Ever since I remember, I was always a sucker for scratch cards. I never really expect to win, but I just like to buy them for fun once in a while. So, about 1,5 years ago I was going to a barbeque party, and while buying booze I also bought a scratch card. I've never bought this particular one before, but it looked like any other scratch card. It had two scratch fields in the middle- the winning numbers, and 6 scratch fields below. As common sense suggested, if any of my winning numbers match the numbers from below, I get a reward associated with the paired number. So, I scratched all the fields, but in 2 of the 6 fields there was a small image saying ""vacation"". I just assumed that there's probably a second winning condition and you need 3 of those images, like in most scratch cards, so I showed it to my friend who was sitting near me and I said ""damn, just my luck, I always only get 2 matching images instead of 3"".  
  
Anyways, a month passed and I was hanging out with the same friend, and we both bought scratch cards. I bought the same one as before. After I scratched the bottom 6 fields again, I noticed that I only had 1 image saying ""vacation"", and that was weird, because everyone who buys scratch cards knows, that they always tease you by missing only one piece. So I read the description, and it said something along the lines ""Find 2 images saying vacation and win the grand prize!"". That's when my heart dropped, I showed it to my friend and he immediately realized that a month ago I actually won. It was hard keeping my tears in for a week. :(  
  
PSA: always read the scratch card description  
  
tl;dr bought a winning scratch card, didn't realize that I won because I assumed that I didn't and I threw it away, realized that I won a month later"
"TIFU by trying to give myself head


(reposted during appropriate time!)

This happened about 3 days ago, i’m finally able to get out of bed.

So I am generously endowed, and have a very good relationship with my dick. Lol. I occasionally post images on reddit and other places, and someone asked me if i could perform auto-fellatio. I hadn’t ever thought of it, so I read some tips, watched some videos and realized that because of my size and my general skinny frame, i have the ideal body type for sucking my own D. How exciting lol.
So, there are a few different approaches, leaning forward or legs over your head. I tried the leaning forward approach but had no luck at all, so then i was like fuck it, got naked, layed down near a wall, threw my legs over my head, and slowly “walked down the wall” as the advice was. Holy shit i was close. Let me also say i was very aroused at the moment, and this was a few days of arousal, so my cock was extra hard and the head was pulsating. As the head flexed and i did, i got my tongue on the tip of my dick basically on the first try. WOW. I was excited and turned on, and hard as fuck.

So, i started stroking and pulling my cock closer to my mouth and it started getting even harder and now i can basically put my lips on the head. it felt insane and i was so happy. as i was stroking, my lips were able to almost fully cover the head, and i started to suckle. it didn’t take much. the whole situation caused a deep orgasm. the shaking kind.

sidebar- yes i came in my mouth. for reference i am totally straight and have never had a dick in my mouth. okay back to the story...

so i’m shaking, feet over my head, dick in my mouth, and the final release pushed my body into a further position, and there it was. not really sure what popped, but i collapsed onto my side and literally couldn’t move. cum dripping out of my mouth, laying on my side, naked, in the bathroom.
luckily feeling came back soon and but i could barely stand up. crawled to bed... had a friend bring me some muscle relaxers, said i tweaked it “cleaning under the counters” lol. still in bed, but can actually walk today.

tl:dr - sucked my own d, came in my mouth, threw out my back.

"TIFU by starting a widespread solvent abuse problem in my school


Compulsory apology for the story not being today, I was 14 aaannnddd I made an error.

My older brothers had been the kids in their grades at our school that had sort of led the charge into underage drinking and similar illicit adventures. This was in a dry country so alcohol was always acquired from black market taxi drivers, and pretty much only vodka and beer. So inevitably the search for alternative sources of the proverbial buzz was a key feature in the teenage party goer's mind. Someone came across a spray you could huff out of a bag that was basically laughing gas and a bunch of dangerous chemicals. I'll not name the spray in case there's any youths reading this that are on a similar hunt, but our name for it was miracle spray and it was ""super bad"" for you (I later found out the main risk was oxygen deprivation, but granted it was not something to be inhaled). There was a brief fad for it at the parties my brothers threw and one of their mates showed me it.

However, in a desperate urge to emulate my brothers, I threw a party in a hotel, which was pretty common there, because of it being a dry country, not many people's families were accommodating of underage drinking etc. On a whim, me and a friend decided to purchase as many cans of miracle spray as we could for the party, which actually went down a treat. It was a great party, much fun was had by all, and at 14, too much fun was had by most. Regardless we came out the otherside unscathed and relishing in our blatant disregard for the law and common sense in the process of having a wild night.

So that was it for a while. We moved on, stories were told, people thought we were cool for having parties, I had successfully attained the reputation I had admired my brothers for. Life was good. 

This did not last long. 

Quickly I found out that kids had started buying cans of this miracle spray and heading to the toilets to huff it during lunches, breaks and eventually classes, just to get a quick high. It wasn't just people who'd been at the party either (a total of 15-20), but other kids as well, and they showed mates and they showed mates and then eventually my grade, the grade above and some kids in the year below were disappearing to the loos to huff this stuff. Now I'd never done it outside of that party and a couple of tries at a party my brother had, but knowing that I had shown my mates and that they were doing it in school, I kind of felt responsible and started telling kids to stop and that it was real dangerous. Turns out I completely was responsible, and when a kid inevitably got caught, obviously the grapevine led all the way back to me and this fab party I'd had, someone ended up showing the teachers pictures of us at the party. The party goers were dragged out of class and our head of grade and senior school principle spent the next hour and a half screaming at us, telling us what idiots we were. Eventually the rest were sent back to class, but as I got up to leave, I was sat back down and was bombarded with saliva and skin rippling reprimand for another hour. These teachers knew my parents, who also worked in education. They explained that some of the kids at this party had really important parents and it was a really small country. If something had gone wrong, my parents could have lost their jobs and maybe even gotten thrown out of the country. One of the least thought through things I have ever done, and definitely not worth it. 

And if any of you are wondering what happened to the school wide solvent problem; it ended pretty much immediately the next day. Miraculously, one might say.

TL;DR: I put my parents' jobs and professional careers on the line to throw a party that led to a school wide solvent abuse problem.

"TIFU By nearly running over my co-worker who was trying to do me a favor.


This is a short one. And also my first post here.

I work at a Motorcycle shop,  we have a service bay where we also do work on cars and trucks, but mostly its just friends, family and staff who get their vehicles done here.

A few months ago I leant my Playstation 3 to the Mechanic since his Xbox barely works, and when it does his 3 kids are fighting over it.  Money was a little tight one week and I had recentley bought a PS4, And have a PC too.. so I just asked him if he wanted to keep it.  We agreed on a price, but then a few days later he remembered it's November, and we are in Canada.. and I hadn't had my winter rims installed yet,  so instead he offered to do my wheel and tire change for free as payment for the Video games and such. I agreed

He asked I come in early this morning so he had time to do the wheels ""off the clock"" incase he got called out first thing in the morning,  I didnt get much sleep last night, So I felt a -little- bit drowsy this morning.  I dragged my ass out of bed, got dressed, and beat it to work.

Pulled in the lot, there was a bunch of trucks all over the yard, and he was standing in the bay door area, talking on the phone and motioning for me to come in.  

Until Today I've had a spotless record with driving, I had to give it some gas to overcome the incline and the lip at the top of the ramp to get into the garage,  I came in a little too fast, and the way I came in, the car bounced and I bumped something on my undercarriage or bumper on the angle of the door lip.  My Co-worker made an ""ouch, that poor vehicle face"" and so did I... except I was more focused on cringing over the admittedly minor bump.. I forgot to move my foot.

I floored it. On the gas pedal.

Let's just say I stopped it in the nick of time.  I slammed on the brakes But had a split second panic because the car was moving so fast, it didn't stop on a dime, it was a RWD Car, so it seemed not to respond to the braking as I was still coming over a lip at the time.   Co-worker had to back pedal and if it had gone another foot I would have pinned him to the wall.  Put the car in park and I just opened the door , both of our faces were white as ghosts and I just sat there profusely apologizing.

I logged on the Security system to get the video, but our cameras suck, they only take pictures like every second...  but here's a video too

https://i.gyazo.com/aff15efa9aac2e191beed1ec474245a9.mp4

TL;DR. I hit the gas instead of the brake, bringing a car into a garage, and Almost fucking pancaked my friend against the wall."
"TIFU by getting eyelash extensions the day before my wedding


This happened over a week ago but I'm only emotionally able to share it with Reddit now.

For some reason I thought it would be a good idea to get eyelash extensions the day before I flew to Vegas to get married. I had starved myself for months, had my hair colored and nails done, and decided to do this to my FACE, despite having never had eyelash extensions before, because I thought it would look good for pictures and I don't know how to put on temporary lashes myself.

So I sought out a salon to get them. I told my best friend who was going to Vegas for the wedding and she wanted them too. Sounds like a great idea! 🙌 Our appointments were 30 minutes apart. I got there right before she finished. When she stood up, her eyes were red and watering, and the lashes were really long, black, and fake looking. I said, do YOU like them? She paid and left. I STILL laid down and got them, even after seeing what my friend's looked like. I guess I didn't want to be rude to the girl at the salon.

5 hours before departure for Vegas. I get home and talk to my friend and we both hate the lashes. I googled how to remove them and told her I was going to the drug store for a makeup remover to soak them off. She talked me out of it since we were going to a salon in Vegas for hair the next day, and we needed a professional to remove them so we don't yank off our natural lashes. They stayed on.

We board the plane for the 5 hour flight on Frontier. My fiance is in the aisle seat (long legs), I'm in the middle and my BFF gets the window seat. Oh, and she gave me an edible before boarding to make the flight go by faster. Yeah, right. Hence the Flight from Hell begins.

First of all, you can't recline your seats on Frontier. And if you want to sleep by leaning forward on the tray with a backpack as a pillow, forget about that since the tray tables are half the size.

So I'm high, uncomfortable, and unable to sleep, and I have these fucking eyelashes glued to my lids and all I can think about is what a freak I must look like. The night before my wedding.

We discuss what the lash girl said NOT to do and decide to do it. Oil is bad for eyelash glue. I dig through my bag and find a travel size argon oil for hair. We both slather it on our lids in hopes that it will loosen the glue. It seems to help.

Finally, after an excruciatingly long flight we check into the hotel. I put more oil on so it soaks overnight. The next morning my friend calls and says she successfully removed hers with an eyelash curler. After my own attempts with an eyelash curler, a panic attack and a hot shower, I finally get them off.

My eyelids are red and swollen. The morning of my wedding. So we go to the hair salon and I soak my lids in cold paper towels. The swelling starts to go down. I go to Ulta to have my makeup done and that guy was a miracle worker. He got a great tip. I didn't look like a freak anynore.

Incidentally, I noticed that all the young women working in Vegas (retail shops, restaurants, bars) seem to have them.

TLDR: I got glued on eyelash extensions the day before my wedding, went through hell to get them off and finally felt normal after professional makeup. It's a cautionary tale. Don't do it."
"TIFU by posting a video of my boyfriend’s dick on snapchat [NSFW]


A few minutes ago I started recording my cat doing something cute up on my boyfriends loft bed, hoping to post it on my snapchat story. The video was just me saying hi to my cat, and then turning to my boyfriend and saying “hi” to him, as he saw that I was recording and whipped his dick out on camera prompting a “Heeey screw yoooou! Whatever dude I’m still putting it on my story...” From me. I thought the whole scene was funny so i put a “NSFW” sticker over his ween and rewatched it, as the sticker trailed over his junk, hiding it completely while still making it evident what he had done without any of the dirty details. nice! I swore I checked and rechecked my sticker placement, he even told me to look at something and I replied “just a sec, im making sure I don’t show everyone on social media your dick” I then posted it and told him to check my story. The realization ensued as follows:

“Umm my dick is still out”
“huh?” 
“The sticker disappeared on the second half of the video”
“FUCK okok im deleting it”

I deleted it immediately, but not after it was viewed by three people. Im still a little mortified, but luckily he’s still laughing about it. 

TL;DR: bf whipped out dong at end of snapchat video, nsfw sticker I inserted over the dong disappeared, 3 people viewed it before i could delete it."
"TIFU by not beeping the horn early enough so people knew where I was.


Went to the car dealership to check out a Range Rover sport. Was working my way through the car and wanted to check the leg room in the back, so, like any normal person, I got in, and shut the door. All was well at this stage, ample leg room, nice arm rests and even ample cup holders. 

Satisfied with the offering, I try to open the door, and nothing happens. I press the unlock button (attached to the door), again, no luck.... hmmm... I try the same manoeuvre on the other door, still no luck. At this point I have flash of genius, surely the driver’s controls can lock and unlock all safety, even child locks! So I reach over to the driver’s side, lock and unlock the doors a couple of times, chuckling to myself, seeing the funny side of the situation whilst thinking, “this is a good feature for anyone who has kids”. 

I try the doors again, still no luck. I’m too big to climb over to the Driver’s side (from the back) and thought it was rude to climb over to the driver’s seat given the car is for sale (I also didn’t want to break something and have to pay for it). I was stuck, and couldn’t get out. I thought, I’ll bide my time, someone will go past. 10-15 mins later, nothing, nada, not even a bird flew past! 

My next thought was “is this some hidden camera show? I best behave myself”, despite knowing in the back of my mind it was probably the child lock. So I try again, do some googling, and realise the child lock is on, and you need a key to get into the electronic functions to deactivate the child lock feature. By this stage I’d been in the car for about 30 mins, nobody had gone past, so I had to call the reception of the dealership and politely ask them to come and open the door (I could see the receptionist from where I was). 

Calling the dealership didn’t go as smoothly as I thought. Firstly, the receptionist couldn’t stop laughing and offered to put me through to the service department. When I explained to her that all she needed to do was to come and open the door, and I was inside a car at the dealership, she proceeded to go and find someone that could open the door. This took another 10-15 mins. I’ve now been in the car for 40 mins. I receptionist come back with a salesman, who goes to the wrong area of the dealership. He’s looking for me in the car park. For goodness sakes! I told the receptionist exactly where I was! After another call to reception, they finally found me and opened the door. Full 45 mins after climbing into the back seat. The ordeal was over and I was so embarrassed, I just walked straight out of the dealership. At least the back seat was comfortable and I had leg room.... and I realised I could have just beeped the horn rather than wait 45 mins. 

TL;DR went to a car dealership and locked myself in a vehicle for 45 mins. Rescue efforts also didn’t go as well as I imagined."

"TIFU by revealing to my parents that I'd shot grandpa's loaded shotgun thinking it wasn't


I was either 9 or 10 years old, living at my grandparents' house temporarily because my mother was ill and unable to take care of both my younger sister and I. I  continued attending 5th grade, just in this different city. Grandpa and one of my uncles were avid hunters and owned several shotguns. I remember sitting there in the room while they would be working on them, discussing the pros and cons, showing off the semi-auto mechanism, and so forth. Sometimes they'd let pull the trigger to get that cool ""click"" noise. So awesome!  


For proper context, I should explain that this was in Eastern Europe a few years after the fall of the Berlin Wall. Criminal activity was the norm - you either defended yourself with whatever means you had, or were liable to become a victim.   


As it turns out, grandpa had returned from keeping guard over his large garden (which included a chicken coop) that was a major portion of our food source, not to mention his main hobby, and being tired, he placed the shotgun in the closet and went to sleep.  


He had something going on during the day, and the rest of the adults were working, besides my grandmother, who had a friend over to read her fortune via \[coffee reading - aka - tasseography\]([http://www.turkishstylegroundcoffee.com/turkish-coffee-reading/](http://www.turkishstylegroundcoffee.com/turkish-coffee-reading/))  


So being my bored self, I wandered in grandpa's room and found the shotgun neatly laid in his closet. Held it in my hand (probably as tall as me at the time) and studied it. Pretty sure I remember looking down the barrel a few times. I then decided to pull the trigger, waiting for the the ever-satisfying ""click"".  


What ended up happening was a huge boom, a tremendous amount of smoke, my breath being knocked out of me, one of my knuckles being bloodied by the unexpected kickback, and ONE ALARMED grandmother coming into the room freaking out, along with her turkish-coffee-reading friend. She asked me if I was hurt, and I told her I was bleeding a little which alarmed her even more. Then I showed her the knuckle and she calmed down some.  


I had shot at the wall in front of me at an angle, which, after creating a nice little crater into it  - this was solid, half-meter thick wall, not the wood and cardboard construction of your typical US house - ended up ricocheting into the nearby room door, leaving a huge hole in it.  


Cue \~20 years later. Dinner with mom, dad and sister. Sharing stories, reminiscing, a sweet nostalgic moment. Then I blurt out: ""So glad you guys never punished me for shooting grandpa's shotgun"". I thought for sure I'd be in serious trouble.""   


To which they replied with astonishment and a surprise. Something akin to ""Huh?"" but via facial expressions. So I repeated myself with all the details, thinking they were messing with me.   


As it turns out, neither of them had any idea this has happened. I had been storing this guilt from childhood without realizing that the guilty ones were the adults. Which is why they had kept this incident from my parents, until I casually shared it with them  


That one little incident destroyed my image that adults can do no wrong. They're all just kids in grown up bodies. Or something like that.  


Thankfully curiosity didn't kill this cat that time.  


TLDR: Shot grandpa's loaded shotgun not knowing it was loaded. Relatives who were taking care of me at the time never divulged it to my parents. I thought it was just my parents being nice all these years not bringing it up, but turns out it was my relatives just protecting their ass."
