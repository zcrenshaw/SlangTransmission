"I have a medical condition that prevents my brain and body from recognizing basic life needs such as hunger, thirst, and tiredness. AMA


Hello!

When I was born I was a bit underweight (5.2 pounds). When I was 6 months old I was 12 pounds, and at 9 months I was still 12 pounds. I was diagnosed with failure to thrive (FTT) at 10 months because I was not gaining weight. I never cried when I was hungry, so my mom never knew when she needed to feed me.

When I was eleven I had minor heat stroke. I told my parents I didn't feel thirsty at all and didn't know to drink water. After conducting tests it was revealed that I am unable to feel hunger or thirst, which is a very rare condition that affects a small amount of the population. I also am unable to feel tiredness, though this is most likely insomnia and unrelated.

Feel free to ask any questions about my life, my experience, or my feelings. I'm not sure how to provide proof since I can't exactly show my medical history, so you'll just have to take my word for it.

"I served as a doctor with the United States Air Force. I advised on large scale disaster preparedness contingencies including a Zombie attack. AMA


First time poster. So forgive me if I forget something obvious. I was directed over here by the comment section of a different post. 

During my time as a military doctor, I worked on disaster preparedness which included biological outbreaks and attacks. An ""Aggression Inducing Illness"" is on that list. The word ""Zombie"" is never used, however, there exists a plan for a Rabies outbreak that would be systemic and wide spread to the point that military intervention would be needed. 

We (military) have prepared for every eventuality that can be thought of. Including ones that have nearly no mathematically significant chance of happening. Like with a pandemic outbreak of rabies.  

I currently work as a Neuropsychologist and Psychotherapist. 

Ask me anything."
"I went unnamed for 18 years of my life. AMA!


I originally posted this on a different AMA subreddit a few days ago, but it got deleted because it didn't fit the guidelines, so here I am!

A little context: My parents had me a month early, didn't have a name picked out and couldn't agree on one. The nurse/doctors let them take me home unnamed under the condition that they'd call back with a name for my birth certificate. Well, they never called back, and the hospital was forced to give me the default name for my state: Baby (Gender) (Lastname). So for me, I ended up being named Baby Girl by default. My parents, who divorced shortly after my birth, never got together to change it officially...so I went as Baby for 18 years until I turned of legal age and got the rights to change it. The name caused more havoc than you might think.

"I am the son of a drug dealer, Who was killed right next to me. AMA!


 

When I was 12 my dad and I were walking up to our home after a day of hanging out. Suddenly 2 masked men, one with a Glock, appeared in front of us. Though the confrontation lasted only seconds, it seemed to happen in slow motion.

The gunman approached quickly, however his timing was off slightly. The goal was to ""walk us into the house"", a popular home invasion technique used to ambush the target(s) as they unlock and open their door, however, my dad hadn't opened nor unlocked the door. Thinking back he may have baited them into charging by touching the door, because as soon as the perp got close he straight up Bonzai charged him, punching him to the ground as the report from the muzzle feet away from my face, centimeters away from my dad rang out abruptly. My dad basically ran through him, the second guy who was hanging back (waiting for the door to open) took off running towards the getaway car parked at the end of the street, my dad behind him, still Bonzai charging. The gunman, seeming just as confused as I was, got off the ground and ran towards the car also.  
After the car sped off, it was quiet again. I will never forget how creepy that silence after ""combat"" was.  
I stood there for what seemed like an hour (It was probably just a few minutes), in the exact same spot on our lawn, waiting for my dad to come back and give me the all-clear.

That never happened.  
I decided I had to look for him. In front of me was a residential street, the left side was lit by the creepiest orange street lights, and the right side was completely dark. Pitch black. The getaway car, my dad and the two perps all went left, but for some reason (probably scared to find what I knew I would find) I went right. Into the Pitch Black. The heely's (shoes with skates in the sole) I was wearing at the time were the only sound I heard click-clacking through the darkness.  
Eventually, I heard a voice call out to me, It was two guys who knew my Dad, I told them what happened and asked them to call my uncle. We then walked back towards the house where I saw two women looking horrified towards the ground, talking on the phone. I knew what it was they were looking at.

My dad.  
When the police and ambulance arrived they immediately began questioning me, as well as preparing to load my dad into the ambulance, however when they found a 1/4oz of cocaine in his pockets the put him back down on the ground, and really showed no interest in trying to save him IMO.  
Eventually (15-30 mins later) the ambulance leaves, and I am taken by the police. If you've ever seen first 48, I was basically treated like a murder suspect, and as I was a kid, they treated me like, or assumed I was stupid. The best examples of this were when the Sargent came in to tell the less than enthusiastic rookie cop who was interviewing me that the ""victim was DOA"". Either he assumed I was too stupid to know what that meant, or he genuinely didn't give a fuck. Either way, I sat there for 12 hours in that cold-ass police station answering their dumbass questions with the knowledge my dad was dead, and they wouldn't even let me contact my family.  
For clarification, I understand that they have a procedure to follow but when I tell them 420 times that the weapon used was a ""Glock, compact model, probably a 19"" and the response is for the investigator to pull out his S&amp;W .357 and say are you sure? Was it a gun like this or more like his (Comparing his revolver to the semi-auto his partner was carrying).  
Honestly after hearing ""DOA"" I was completely numb, I had told them all the information about what happened within the first 30 mins, so for the next 11 and 1/2 hours I sat there just wanting to go home get in the bed (I had been up for over 24 hours by this point) and hopefully wake up to realize this was just a fucked-up dream.

Instead, when they finally dropped me off at my grandma's house the next morning, I had to relieve everything for my interview with the shooters hell-bent on revenge. The most awkward part was trying to act surprised that my dad was dead when my uncle pulled me to the back to tell me. I couldn't tell him that I had already known for 12 hours, and I was still wrestling with the fact that I knew this would happen the entire summer (insanely strong precognition that I tried to block out).

For clarification, I was born and raised in the south, however, my parents were together on the west coast before my mom moved down south after my dad killed a guy in self-defense in front of his mom's house. My mom's mother freaked and moved the fuck out of dodge, they settled in the south where we have lots of family and 8 months or so later I was born. Every summer since I was about 6 or 7, I flew out to spend the summer with my dad, it was honestly the highlight of every year. It was like going to a different world.

My dad was very lowkey and kept things as hidden as possible from everybody who wasn't directly involved, but being a perceptive kid I figured out what was going on, eventually. Im not sure when he figured out I knew, but i do remember having at least a couple awkward summers where I knew, and I felt like he knew I knew but he still did things to hide it from me (which I really respect). The funniest example of this, was when we had a heatwave and it was literally 120 degrees outside but he demanded I go outside to play. Nobody was outside and the heat was unbearable, I just wanted to go inside and play Xbox in the ac. I retreated to the porch and happened to glance through the window (the shudders were cracked slightly) and I saw my dad breaking down a BRICK of coke, literally a whole brick on the table. I sat there, on one hand, appreciating the effort to keep me away from that life, but honestly, I never had the slightest interest in it anyway, and I was about to have a fucking heatstroke.

Honestly, the whole situation rocked my whole outlook on life. The strategy to dealing with the trauma was to ""keep (me) busy"" so over the next month I attended 3 camps, before going to band camp (I was on the drumline) and then starting high school shortly after. Basically I was on autopilot floating through life and when I picked my head up and looked around I was in my 20's working a job I couldn't see myself at long term, up to my eyes in student loan debt for a degree that was basically worthless in reality, and just overall down about life. I wasn't suicidal, but i didn't care about living either.

One day things came to a head and I quit, took a trip to Costa Rica to clear my mind, came back and ended up becoming a contractor over in Iraq. I returned to the states in 2018 and have been trying to figure it out ever since. The difference is this time I am actively taking control over my healing process, and charting a course I believe will lead me to success.

I'm not sure if anyone will even read this, but sharing this with the world has been extremely cathartic for me so I would like to thank the Reddit community for the opportunity to share this story I've kept inside for so many years"

"I was abused by my birth father and was kidnapped by him for six days. AMA


Hello everyone.

My name is Emily Turner, but my birth name is Emily Reed.

My mother died when I was four years old. My father quickly became physically and emotionally abusive. I had to come home immediately after school and spent the majority of my childhood locked in my bedroom. Whenever I was not in my bedroom, my father would yell at me, hit me, kick me, throw me against the wall, etc.

When I was twelve my school realized what was happening and I was adopted by my English teacher. He took me in on November 8,1996. He adopted me March 1, 1997, on my 13th birthday.

On April 21st, 1997, my birth father kidnapped me after school. He took me to my old home and locked me in the hall closet. He abused me over a period of six days, until late at night April 27th, when I escaped.

"I am a clinically diagnosed sociopath and I am so tired of these bratty snowflakes pretending this condition to be a cool thing. AMA.


Anti Social Personality Disorder is not cool, it not glamourous, it is a massive pain in the ass. Your entire life centres around negating this condition. It usually comes with a whole bunch of other messed up things. You are not a genius, a perfect emotionless machine, in reality you cannot do tasks which you *normally* could have. Everyone wants to be Sherlock,but no one talks about the day to day or the small small things which accumulates and snowballs. It's not about the dark emotionless nights but about the odd things that you do which people pick up as ""wierd"".

AMA about the nitty gritty details and not so glamorous day to day life."
"I went into surgery for a lip cyst removal and woke up 10 days later as an above knee amputee at age 23, AMA!


A podcast called This is Actually Happening came out with an episode about my story last week (S9E1). Like the title says, I went in for a minor surgery at 23. The anesthesia triggered heart failure which by a domino effect caused total organ failure. My lungs failed, my kidneys failed, my liver failed, etc. I was placed on a heart-lung bypass called ECMO, as well as being on dialysis while in a coma. A side effect of being on ECMO is often amputation. My right leg had no pulse and the fascia died. My heart was too fragile to go into surgery for a day or two so my leg continued to die. When I was finally ready for the amputation surgery, my leg had died above the knee. All of this occurred while I was in a ten day coma, so when I woke up most of the drama had already occurred. I almost died and am lucky and happy to be alive and walking at 25. AMA"
