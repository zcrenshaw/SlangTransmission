"Men who talk at the urinals, what the fuck is wrong with you?

"When did you see your first boob (or boobs)?


Was having a conversation at work and we all shared when I saw our first boobs. I was maybe 10 or 11 and had gone on my yearly trip with my mom. (Believe me, it's not going there) We went to Florida and went to a water park called Wet N' Wild. I went down one of the big water slides and waited at the bottom to get splashed by all the other people going going down the slide. A girl came down the slide and when she hit the bottom where all the water collects, her top slid up. As soon as she stood up, she realized what happened and pulled it back down and ran off. Myself and all the other kids my age were just in pure shock and awe. Best day of my young life."
"This girl I'm seeing just set the TV's volume to 21. What's the easiest way to tell her it's not going to work out?


"
"When you have a new girl over, how much do you ask or not ask when making moves?


Had a tinder date over last night and I felt kinda embarrassed because I kept asking before doing stuff like asking to cuddle, cupping her breast, even to go down and fuck her. Admittedly don't have much experience with doing this and probably wouldn't have asked so much if the last person I had over didn't shut me down super quick when I tried to rest my hand on her stomach under her shirt. So what's an acceptable amount? I want to be respectful but I also know it's usually on guys to take the initiative and don't want to ruin the mood by keep asking questions."
"Big or small, doesn't matter. What are you looking forward to and why?


The weekend. Borderlands 3. Getting down to 160lbs."
"I, the mother of a teenage boy ran out of body wash and so used some of his. Two showers later and I can still taste, never mind smell lynx/axe 'Africa' How do I get rid of it?

"What do you find genuinely amazing about women?

"Hairy men of Reddit, what is the weirdest situation that you've been through involving you being hairy?


One time I was at a theme park and I took a ride where you get splashed with water, after the ride I went to the lockers to change my soaked shirt and while I was changing I saw my friend chuckling, I asked him: What?, he said look behind you, and I looked and saw three kids and their mom staring at my hairy back with weirded out  faces and disgust, I didn't know how to react, just wore my shirt and walked away.

Now I can tell that my friends aren't even joking around when they call me a werewolf"
"What are some non-sexual things you love about women that make you weak?


F22, I was wondering what makes someone have a crush/like a woman.... Share with me!"
"How common is it for guys to slap their dick on a vagina before putting it in?


"
"Stupid question: guys what's your move for initiating a kiss if there's a big height gap?


So I'm not super tall, 5'10 but I'm used to dating girls that are 5'7-5'8. 

Recently dated a few girls in that 5'1 range, and if it's time to go for a kiss, if we are standing I find myself freezing because it just seems like a big gap. 

I know I'm overthinking things, but is there any tricks you guys use?"

"Guys, why do most of you like girls with no makeup?


For a little bit of time I've been doing a full face everyday. I decided to stop for a few days now because it took more time, and I got the complete opposite reaction of what I had expected. I thought everyone, mostly guys, would be disgusted to see me without makeup and that less guys would hit on me but the opposite happened. One guy I talk to in class even said, wow you look so much better without all that stuff on your face (he's an international student, so he didn't know what the english word for makeup was.) I'm just wondering why. I keep hearing guys talk about how they don't like girls who wear too much makeup and I see the girls who get the most attention are surprisingly the ones with no makeup. I'm just surprised because it goes against everything I thought to be true for the past 8 years."
"Fellow straight dudes, how many of you actually told your first time sexual partner that she was your first time? How many tried to act like you knew something? And how did it go?


I told her well beforehand, but as time revealed, she actually just didn't believe me. Only afterwards she eventually said, ""So that was really your first time?"""
"Guys, what's something awesome you've done lately that you want to brag about?

"How to pursue a healthy platonic relationship with a woman?


I‚Äôm 22 and I realized the other day I don‚Äôt have any close female friends. All the women in my life are ‚Äúpotential partners‚Äù if you will, flirting back and forth and all that. I would like to change that about myself.  This sounds pretentious I‚Äôm aware, but it would be really nice to learn how to overcome that urge to flirt with every woman who I get close too. So sorry if any of this is impolite or a stupid question ."
"What do you genuinely find amazing about other men?

"Single dads: What's the most infuriating thing you've been told (that's related to your single dad status)?


I have a couple of equally infuriating instances:

(1) Date asked me ""So how did you manage to get custody of your kid?"" Before I could answer that question, she asked ""Is his mother dead?""  As if men shouldn't have an equally likely chance as a woman to get custody of their kids. At first, I thought maybe she was just socially awkward on the subject, but then she started making more snide comments about how kids belong with their mothers. 

(2) Girl told me ""I'm scared to date you now now that I know you have custody of your kids. I know that typically fathers get custody because they abused the mother into submission."""
"How do you develop self confidence when being constantly rejected?


How do you develop self confidence when everyone has rejected you? Like if every girl has rejected you how do you have the confidence to keep trying or if you have never had friends how do you have the courage to jeep trying to make them?"

"Can men tell when someone is checking you out?


As a woman, I've talked about this with my girlfriends. We can usually tell when someone is looking at our chests or butts. Are men aware when someone is scoping out their... bulge?"
"How do you flirt with a girl that you‚Äôre already friends with?


So I‚Äôm kinda crushing on my friend, and I don‚Äôt want to go from 0-100 with the flirting and I wanna test the waters out and see if she reciprocates. I‚Äôm thinking I‚Äôll gradually start to flirt. How can I do this? I‚Äôve been friends with her for a while, so I don‚Äôt want to make a complete switch and flirt with her too much. I‚Äôm not sure if this really makes sense or not, I just don‚Äôt want to come off as a creep because we‚Äôre friends and then I‚Äôm trying to flirt out of nowhere. What should I compliment her on?"
"How important is physical contact in a relationship to you?


I personally need it so...

Long-distance is a no-no."
"What makes sex feel intimate for men?


I've had a lot of hookups in the past but a lot of them were ""eh"" and not anything too special or memorable. 

But the ones that do stand out to me were the guys that took their time during sex, made a lot of eye contact, kissed me all over, told me I look beautiful/hot during sex, and cuddled me and held me tight afterwards. It made the entire thing so much better. 

Sure that feels great as a girl, but what about for men? What adds that X factor that makes sex feel more passionate and intimate for men?"
"What's one piece of advice your father gave you that you live by?


For me it was at one of my birthdays as a kid. We were at the local camping spot, and dad had to run into town to get more food as we had eaten too much being kids. When he came back there was a stranger with him. Dad told me that this man needed help, and it looked like it was going to storm, so he would be sleeping with us that night. I thought nothing of it and went about my birthday. This man ate our food, ate some of my cake, sang songs with us, told a scary story, and that night my dad let him sleep in a spare tent we had in the camper. The next morning after breakfast my father loaded him up and was gone for a better part of the day. When he got back i was complaining, and he told me ""No matter what, our family always helps those who need it. Even if it's an inconvenience, a (Family Last Name) will give the shirt off our back if we must."" Now that I'm older I know it was a homeless man. I now know my father kept in touch with him, gave him some money and helped that man many more times to get back on his feet.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm not the saint my father is, but I won't turn a blind eye to anyone in need. I remember that birthday well, and I'm thankful for the lesson my father taught me."
"Boyfriend is quitting smoking on the 15th. What are some things that I can do to support him?


My boyfriend has his quit date set for the 15th of September, and I‚Äôm so proud of him for making that step. I don‚Äôt nag him or ever tell him that he should stop, so I was really excited/surprised when he told me he was going to quit. I don‚Äôt think giving up cigarettes will be as hard for him as giving up his vape, he‚Äôs said he‚Äôs more addicted to that than to cigarettes. He‚Äôs already got nicotine patches. He‚Äôs not going to use Chantix because his dad used that and it made him feel really weird. I‚Äôve told him I‚Äôll give him shoulder rubs anytime he wants to distract him from it when the urge to smoke strikes. So people who have quit or people who know someone that quit:

What have been some things that helped you quit? 

What have your loved ones done to support you and make it easier for you?"
"How are you treated by women?


I am an 18 y/o female and I have a very hard time calling myself a feminist. This is because women are treating men terribly in the name of feminism.

For example, I just got kicked out of the ""Ask Women"" thread. There was a post asking what women thought of men and couples saying ""were pregnant"" instead of ""were expecting""

One of the comments talked about how men say ""were pregnant"" as a form of stroking their egos when they're not carrying the baby themselves. This was accompanied with some other rude points along the lines of men wanting attention and stealing women's thunder.

I replied by asking questions as to how they came to that conclusion. My comment got removed for being ""off topic"". After a conversation with the moderators as to how it was off topic, I was banned without reason. 

Over the years, I've noticed that nobody cares to hear anything about men's side of things because your past generations misconduct.

How does this effect your life and relationships? Do you experience any type of bigotry or sexism in the name of feminism? How do you handle it?"

"Those of you with white teeth, how in the fuck did you do it?


I brush twice daily, sometimes 3 times if I'm going out some time during the day.  I floss a couple times a week (I could lie and say I floss every day).  I've already finished my year with clear aligners (currently on month 3\[?\] of 6 of wearing my retainers daily until I can just wear them at night) so my teeth are straight and able to be flossed and cleaned easier.  I clean these retainers whenever I brush my teeth and right before I leave work.  Even when doing all this, my teeth have a yellow tint to them.  

I've tried those crest white strips, but for some reason, they make my teeth sensitive.  I do drink coffee daily, so that could be making my teeth yellow, but I know some of you drink coffee and wine on the daily and still have pearly whites.  

If there's any wealth of knowledge to spread, please spread this one."
"Why are some girls only seen as a means to a good time and nothing worth investing in?


This probably isn‚Äôt allowed, but I‚Äôm going to use a personal example for this. I get a lot of matches on hinge and tinder (28). My profile isn‚Äôt littered with party pics or filtered selfies. I almost always land that second date, I get excited to spend more time with them.

 In my life I‚Äôve slept with only a handful of men... I don‚Äôt want to have a high body count out of personal preference... so my standard is that I‚Äôm not spreading my legs for anyone who isn‚Äôt my boyfriend and I‚Äôm honest about it. If a guy isn‚Äôt ok with it I enjoy the rest of the evening, we hug goodbye and wish each other the best. However I‚Äôve had a minimum of 10 dates ‚Äòaccept‚Äô my boundaries, but then in the same breath push hard against those boundaries as if they are a challenge. The first time and only time it successfully happened was with someone I‚Äôd been seeing for nearly a month. He made me dinner a few times at his place, we went out for coffees and had really deep conversations about our views and relationship goals, I was falling for him, I specifically remember the line ‚Äúit‚Äôs just going to be so nice to have a normal girlfriend‚Äù making me feel excited about where things were going. 

we were out for drinks and watched a movie at his place. I decided to stay the night at his request, naturally we had sex for the first time, it was great...and then the next day he made me breakfast and seemed normal. Later he texted me ‚Äúcan you please take plan b‚Äù even though we used protection. I was confused and had never taken it, so I did... and then....he vanished and never spoke to me again. Genuinely. Poof. Gone.

I would never treat someone so terribly so it crushed me and I felt dirty and slutty especially after spending a lot of time getting to know each other. But I come across this behaviour again and again although I‚Äôve never allowed a guy like that to get in my pants since.... is this normal? Do some girls just look like the means to a good time and not anything worth investing in?"
"Divorced men of Reddit who married again, please tell me there‚Äôs life after a divorce and you can be happy again. What‚Äôs your story?


After 12 years of marriage I got a divorce, right after that I lost my house, can‚Äôt see my kids everyday, lost my job, started doing drugs... right now I just feel like dying. Is there hope?"
"Ever had someone you're dating unintentionally comment on your biggest insecurity? How did you react?


So I've been seeing this girl I like for a couple months, just dating and chatting so far. Today I went to the dentist to finally complete work I needed done and I was really happy with the work. I needed a front crown and a little straightening of my incisors. It cost alot but I needed it for me

During the final checkup I got a head shot from my dentist with my new smile and sent it to the girl I'm dating and her first comment was ""Is he turning you into a vampire?"". My teeth are my biggest insecurity and all the confidence I had just washed away with that comment.

Have you had a similar experience where an insecurity has been highlighted or come out unexpectedly and caught you off guard?

I'm trying to be mature about it but won't lie. It hurt"
"What takes sex from good to absolutely mind blowing?


I've loved this guy for 10 years and he has apparently been in love with me for 10 years too. We just started officially seeing each other. The emotional side is amazing already because we are best friends. But I really want to rock his world in the bedroom. He sees me as sweet, tender and loving but I want to be a freak in the sheets for him."
"How would you want a partner to deal with you finishing early in bed?


I like this guy and I feel bad cause he felt bad but it was absolutely fine. It was actually super hot that he couldn‚Äôt wait."
