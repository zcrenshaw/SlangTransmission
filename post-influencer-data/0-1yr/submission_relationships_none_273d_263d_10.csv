"How can I (20F) end a relationship with a guy (24M) who doesn’t see me?


Hello!

So I’ve been dating a guy for about 3 months now. In the beginning, things were really good. We were open about communication, went on dates, and had a really good connection. 

In the past month or so, things have been different. He has made plans with me maybe two or three times during our relationship. In the beginning, it didn’t bother me that I was the one making plans, but lately it’s just felt so one sided. I pointed this out the other day over text and he said “Not a conversation I want to have right now” and then ignored me all day. It really hurt me and I wasn’t trying to be accusatory at all, just wanted to talk about it. And then he texted me like normal, with no mention of him ignoring me. 

Also, we had dinner plans last week. I asked if they were still on and he didn’t reply until hours later, saying he fell asleep. He didn’t apologize or ask to reschedule. 

I will drive to his house to spend the night, but he has only once come to see me, and that was when I was taking him to the airport the next day because I live closer. 

At this point, I know it’s not healthy. I’ve been reluctant to reply to his messages or Snapchats because I know he won’t reply and I just don’t want to feel neglected like that. But, even if I open Snapchats, he will send like 5 until I reply, only to ignore my reply. 

How do I end this? I’m feeling rejected by him and like he’s doing this to get me to do the dirty work of breaking up. Also, I haven’t seen him in person so I doubt I’ll be able to break up to his face. Is a text ok?

tl,dr: guy hasn’t been treating me the best. Do I need to break up with him in person? Also, do I bring up what’s been bothering me when I do it?"
"My [20sF] boyfriend [20sM] of a little over a year is sad, and I don't know how to help him.


I don't want to give too many details because I want to respect his privacy, even though I sincerely doubt he'll find this.

The thing is, my boyfriend is a very respectful, introspective person.  He's not someone that's ruled by emotion, yet he's not one of those ""I'm so logical and intelligent that I'm going to treat you like a douche"" kind of guys.  

If he has a problem, he seems to take the time to consider why he's unhappy, and just kind of... tanks the unhappiness, as far as I can tell, until he finds a solution or gets over it.  Even this far into the relationship, it takes a lot of disturbance in the force for him to mention he's frustrated, and he seems to feel guilty for doing even that.

I am, I'm ashamed to say, somewhat the opposite.  I'm emotional and a bit hotheaded.  If I'm stressing, I fuss and fuss.  My boyfriend is wonderful; he lets me talk it out with him and offers his support without adding fuel to the fire.  At the most, if he thinks I've been shafted, he'll let me know he doesn't think he should comment, as he doesn't want to disparage someone close to me.

Without trying to go into too much detail, my boyfriend is unhappy with the conduct of some of his family.  He spent most of the day feeling a lot of frustration and sadness, both emotions which he readily owned.  

I tried to talk it out with him, but he didn't want to talk about it, because (he said) he would feel ungrateful if he did.  I suspect I pushed too much to talk before he said that because he logged off.  (For reference, we live far enough apart that we see each other maybe once a week and I can't pop in on him, so we often make up time playing online together.)

I have no idea how to support him when he's feeling this way.  I don't want to push him to talk when he obviously isn't comfortable talking, but if I just give him space, I feel like a crappy girlfriend.  He's sad and, hell, I love him - I'm worried about him.

I don't quite understand, because talking always helps me at least a bit, but that doesn't mean I don't respect that he feels how he feels.  If anything, I wish I could be more like him.

All I was able to do when he left was to text that I'm here if he needs anything.

It doesn't feel like enough, and I'm not going to straight up *ask* him because it's frustrating when you're feeling emotionally bad and you have to explain to someone how to be there for you.

Does anyone know how I can better support my boyfriend when this kind of thing is happening?

TL;DR: My boyfriend doesn't want to talk about problems he's having with others when others are making him unhappy.  I don't know how to support him when he feels low because of it.  Please advise.

"My [25M] girlfriend [25F] of two years is against me getting cut and says she prefers thick me


A bit over a year ago I got seriously into working out. Back then I was very skinny, I had abs but very little muscle mass, people often tried to force food on me because they said I wasn't even eating enough and I was basically invisible to women. 

I started working out because I have a friend who did the same thing and it was amazing to see how it changed him, not only his looks but also how he acted, his confidence in himself and such. So I read up on nutrition online and picked a training plan. Eating a lot more was difficult at first but over the months as I saw progress I kind of got used to it. 

So over this time I put on some mass, almost 50 lbs in total, a bit less actually. My numbers shot up and I figure at least half of it is muscle mass. However that also means that I gained quite a bit of fat, at least 20 lbs. 

I dislike that as I actually prefer being lean and having abs and such, after all one of my motivations to get big was to be aesthetic eventually. However my girlfriend likes bigger me better, she often tells me how fun it is to cuddle with me now and how it's a good look for me. 

When I told her that I want to lose weight for summer next year she told me that she thought I was fine how I was and that I didn't need to lose any weight. Im not sure if that's her honest opinion, after all who wouldn't prefer their partner to be cut with abs while also strong, or if she feels threatened by it, like she's a bit chubby herself, which I don't mind at all, so maybe she feels like it puts pressure on her to also lose weight, or maybe she's worried that I might get more attention from other women? 

What do you think? Originally I thought she'd be happy if I got in great shape, now I'm feeling a bit demotivated. 

--------

**tl;dr**: Gained mass over the last year and want to cut down soon bit girlfriend says she likes thick me better

"This girl is acting weird is she being flirty?


First off this girl lets just call her Emma is in one of my classes. Everyday she dresses SUPER skimpily but she is super nice and aight looking. She´s not what i´d consider to be a a person who goes from man to man because i´m pretty sure she´s only dated 1 guy in 2 years. A few days ago we were put in the same group as well as 2 others so it was me, her and 2 other guys. We were working and she was acting kinda weird.

We had to draw a large poster and she kept rolling around on the poster at weird angles to draw. She always asked me questions about the poster even though I told the group at the beginning that I didn´t know shit about the project because I was gone the day we learned about it. Then in the middle of the project she turns to me and goes, ¨HEY, what math are you in?¨ And I´m like IB Algebra 2/3 and she´s like wow i´m only in regular algebra 2 i´m not smart enough for the class you´re in. Every time we talked we made pretty strong eye contact. It seemed like she kept looking for my approval cause she was like did I draw this well? To me and asked me how she should draw the stuff and asked for my opinion.

She never made eye contact with the others and didn´t really talk to them and was always asking me stuff like is she did a good job, or what she should put where, even though I made clear I didn know anything cause I was gone. I still helped her out though. I´m definately not gonna ask out because my friends don´t really like her but if she asks me i´m likely to say yes. I´m wondering if these are sign of interest also, ask any questions or things I might have left out. Also, I need to be very sure she likes me before I like ask her out because there´s another girl I like and I don want her to feel like she´s ¨my safety net¨ if emma says no and I ask her out.

​

TLDR: This sorta girl is possibly giving me interested signals i´m wondering if she´s interested or not.

"Girlfriend of 6 months wants to keep child we tried to prevent being a possibility.


I never thought this would happen to me and I'm losing my mind.

I am currently in my first relationship with my girlfriend who is 17. We have been together just over 6 months, and one of the first things we agreed was protection.

She didnt like using condoms and was afraid of the rod, so we decided on the pill, which she has always used when we have had sex, she says she has always used it.

She has been unwell for a few months, she had a bacterial infection of the stomach (h pylori) and I had to take her home from college a couple of days ago because she was in unbearable pain crying her eyes out so I left college to get her a taxi home. 

I had been pushing her to go to the doctors again  but she kept pushing it back. She went yesterday and was told she is 6-8 weeks pregnant. So the pill didnt work.

I know her stance on abortions and it is a horrible predicament, but we were using that protection to prevent this, I didnt ask for this and I have vocally told her on multiple occasions I do not want a child at this time, we're still kids ourselves and we dont have anywhere near the resources for it. I am an apprentice and she works weekends as a waitress. 

This situation is horrible and I am so frustrated its happened because I feel I did my upmost to prevent it. She now seems to have totally changed and is giving me no say in the decision.

Her background isnt great, she moved out of her alcoholic mothers to live with her grandparents and as I mentioned she is only 17. I dont see how she expects to bring this child up and give it a good life, thats her goal but we cant acheive it in these circumstances, her grandparents would not let her live there if they found out, and her mother is an absolute volatile unhinged mess, not someone to bring up a child around.

I have been realistic in bringing up all these issues. She says I am focused on the negatives. I cant see any positives to this, if we do want to last we need to know we will, when we found out we were crying our eyes out like kids and to me that shows we're nowhere near ready. 

Her attitude is to take a risk and give it a chance, how can you do that with a life? You cant just give it away if it doesnt work out. I have asked her to think about this rationally and consider that we didnt want this, and now thats its accidentally happened that she suddenly does. I get she will still be in shock and then options are awful for both of us, but the longer it goes the harder this will be and I can't watch her throw her life away like this.

TL:DR- Used contraception to prevent the possiblity of a child, it didnt work and now my girfriend of 6 months wants to keep a child at 17. "
"My (26f) boyfriend (27m) is perfect except for his past


My boyfriend and I have been in a relationship for two years. He’s the perfect partner. We communicate well and love each other. In spite of this, I’m plagued by a bizarre, irrational and retroactive jealousy of his past relationships.

He’s had two other relationships before me. I fixate on these relationships and I feel insecure and possessive of him, even though rationally I know there’s is nothing wrong with him having dated other people. I’ve fallen into destructive habits like searching his Instagram for old photos of him with his previous girlfriends, thinking about how they might have been better than me, how he must have cared for them and imagining the sexual things they did together. I feel miserable and ashamed when I have these thoughts, but I indulge them anyway.

My problem is exacerbated by the fact that he’s the only person I’ve ever been involved with romantically or sexually — I was determined for my first time to mean something with someone important to me — so in addition to feeling jealous of his past relationships, I’m also jealous that he’s had normal romantic experiences. It feels like I've missed out something in my own past and I feel foolish for having waited for my first time to be “special”. What does special even mean? Now, I feel incredibly inferior in comparison to my boyfriend.

I know that logically speaking, my feelings are silly. I want to enjoy our relationship and let go of the past. But how? I’ve talked to my bf about my struggles and he reassures me, but soon I’m back in my self-destructive spiral. I can’t seem to get over it and I fear it’s going to destroy us.

  
**tl;dr: I am suffering with retroactive jealousy (irrational obsessive jealousy) over my boyfriend's past. He was my first everything and I also feel jealous of him having experienced normal relationships whilst I was stupidly waiting for ""the one"". How can I stop feeling like this?** "
"How do I bring up issues without him getting angry, defensive, or shutting down?


Yesterday, my boyfriend (31M) left the trash out in the kitchen and I (30F) found that our dog had gone through it. Our dog has a sensitive stomach and gets sick from eating trash. This has happened a couple of times even after I reminded my boyfriend. I want to bring this up with him and have a productive conversation, but I’m hesitant because when I bring up issues, he tends to get defensive regardless of how hard I try to be non-accusatory. We often never end up addressing the issue that I brought up, because he feels attacked, starts deflecting, gets angry, and shuts down. Eventually, he’ll say that he’ll try harder next time. But the same issues keep cropping up and he doesn’t ever come up with concrete proposals for how to change. Most of the time I end up apologizing and coming up with a plan for how to do better. 

Examples of things he’ll say:
“I’m stressed from work that’s why I exploded”
“I was going through a hard time, I was depressed, that’s why I took it out on you”
“You brought it up at a bad time”
“I reacted because you pushed me/triggered me”
“Your tone was accusatory”
“You do x,y,z too”
“I guess that just makes me bad dog owner/boyfriend then”
“Why are you with me then, if I’m such a terrible person”
“I can’t talk to you when you raise your voice, you’re getting heated” (after he’s raised his voice and I’ve tried really hard not to)

I try hard to not accuse, raise my voice or show that I’m upset when I bring things up. I try to show that I’m bringing this up because I care about working through it together, not to point fingers, and make sure to hear and validate him throughout. But he still gets upset or shuts down, which makes me hesitant about voicing concerns. I’m debating not even bringing this up because I’m worried it will lead to another fight when all I want is to have a discussion. That’s why I’d like feedback on what I’m planning to say:

Hey X, I noticed you left the trash out and our dog went through and ate the scraps. Could we try to not leave trash out unattended, since we know he eats it and gets sick? This has happened a couple of times. I know that it’s easy to forget. I’m totally not blaming you or trying to be critical. Is there a way I could help you remember or a system we could implement?

Tldr: I’m at the end of my rope trying to figure out how to bring issues up without him getting angry or shutting down. Am I the problem here?"
"I [25f] feel a massive disconnect from half of my biracial heritage and don’t know what to do


I’ll try to be brief. Also, it’d be nice if some black people would respond but all advice is appreciated. 

So my white mom dropped out of high school and ran away to the nearest city, got pregnant, went back home and raised me in the very white Midwest. My black father was in a relationship with someone else at the time, mom was a side chick. While I know who he is and have talked to him on via text, we’ve never met. He didn’t try when I was a kid, and as an adult I'm resentful (something I *just* realized last week). Because I was raised by my white mom, I’ve missed out on alllll the rich black culture. I’m still learning on how to do my hair, how important it is to moisturize, that mac and cheese is great on thanksgiving. I don’t know anything about the R&amp;B or rap icons of the 90s. I know I’m missing so much more but I don’t know what to search for, I don’t know anything about any of it. 

Because I am in NO WAY white passing, I identify as black and people see me as black. The problem is, people (both white and black, but it's easier to handle from the white side) expect me to be on that cultural level. When I don’t recognize a Whitney song or something like that, black folks (and other mixed folks) are shocked and often judgmental. 

I’m honestly pissed at both of my parents for not making sure I spent time with my father. My mom was convinced that I “don’t need him, we’re good enough on my own,” and Idk what went through my dad’s head, but he never pushed for visitation. Now, I’m missing out on the entire cultural aspect of half of my identity and I don’t know what to do. 

My first thought was to make black friends, and I have a few, but I’m still “othered” and judged by them for not getting it/being on their level. My white therapist (who is great generally) has been hinting that I should consider reuniting with my father, but I don’t see how that could go any better than making black friends has gone. I’m not totally against it, but I worry that my resentment would just make that messy. 

I just want to learn. I can’t get back the years I missed, but I want to be able to be around people who look like me and not feel judged, I want to be able to connect with that part of my identity. Right now I’m in a play made up of completely multiracial people (all black and white) and I thought that maybe I wouldn’t feel that way with them, but they’ve all had contact with their black families, and it’s easy to see how much stronger their bonds are and it’s easy to see how incredulous they are when I don’t get something. It’s been a devastating disappointment, being othered by them too, because I’d almost convinced myself it was in my head. Idk how to fix this, but I feel super alone and I’m tired of it. 

 

Tl;dr: Raised by white mom, missed out on black culture, and now struggle to connect with and feel judged by other black people. I don’t know how to fix this. "
"Husband acts like jerk with old friends


Okay, hoping for some insight.

I (26f) have been married to my husband (30m) for four years. Like most people, he has multiple different friend groups from various stages of his life (his best friends from high school, his army friends, his graduate school friends, etc.) I have met all of these different friend groups over the last 7 years of our relationship.

I’ve noticed that my husband sometimes acts - mostly talks - like a different person around certain friend groups, especially his “army friend” group. I know most of the guys in this group because we had just started dating when they were all in the same unit about 7 years ago. Life was very different back then- they were all in their early 20s.. heavy drinkers.. partying every weekend. We are settled down now with an almost two year old, and most of those guys are in serious relationships around the country too.

Anyway, for example, my husband will make jokes about leaving me (usually in reference to moving closer to his friends, obviously a joke but even still). Once he was talking to a friend about getting married and said something like “being married is okay once you get used to not having an opinion anymore”. He refers to me as “the wife”, and paints me in a poor light. For instance, someone might make a comment and he will respond with “yeah well try to tell my wife that”. The most recent was a comment about how they would “look but not touch” other women and it just seemed so.. gross and out of place.

We have a good relationship and he doesn’t act this way in person when I’m around.. he is always proud to include me and he is very affectionate and respectful toward me typically. This is more like banter between guy friends, but I can’t help but feel disrespected when I see this type of thing plastered all over social media. I also don’t really see the other guys talking about their significant others this way so it really kind of upsets me. I haven’t spoken to my husband yet, but was just wondering if anyone can shed some light? Is this normal?

Tl;dr- My husband acts like a different person with old friends and it bothers me."
"My boyfriend [30] thinks I'm [F25] lying when I'm not.


So recently me and my boyfriend of 8 months had a discussion about a tougher issue with our relationship about me feeling like I want to spend more time with him than he does with me and that it seemed like I got more excited to see him than he does with me. He apologized as this was never his intent but sometimes he just feels overwhelmed with everything so he just has to take things at his own pace. Following that discussion I have felt anxiety about that issue and some of the other issues we might have. Yesterday a fleeting thought came into my mind that I never ever felt before and that was ""what is he doing when he's not with me? Because it seems I'm more excited to see him sometimes and he likes to have alone time to recharge."" My mind immediately went to maybe he's cheating. Logically there is no way he could be but I decided to tell him I just had this thought . The thought was fleeting and I got over it but while we were talking he mentioned that a couple of weeks ago, he went outside and left his phone and when he came back, he thought I was acting different and there was something wrong. There was nothing wrong with me except maybe I was just tired or just quiet but he brought up that he thought I went through his phone. The thing is I never did go through his phone and I would have so many opportunities to do so because he gives it to me all the time. He said that if I did go through his phone it's okay and he'd rather I be honest but I did not. He has to communicate with the mother of his child and other women from work but that has never bothered me and he thinks that it does. He doesn't have anything to hide and he'd gladly give me good phone if I decided to ask for it and I've never been jealous or wondering who he's talking to before this day.  I wish that I never said anything about cheating because it was more of a me problem and it was a fleeting thought. But now I just have intense anxiety thinking that he thinks I'm lying to him and that maybe we have more issues than I thought. What am I supposed to do when he thinks I'm lying? How do we move passed this and what if I just keep finding small flaws within our relationship? How do we work through this? 

TL;DR Boyfriend thinks I'm lying about going through phone or that something is wrong when I didn't and there isn't. Worried we have more issues than I thought. How do we work through this? "
"My friend [25F] blocked me [27M] without saying anything.


I'm heart broken about this, and I know the answer is to just move on but I really need to put my thoughts into words because it's tearing me up inside.

I've had this friend that I've been close with for 10 years now who I've always been there for and she randomly about 2 weeks ago blocked me without saying a single word to me. 


We never were romantic together but we've been on dates a few times, never even kissed or anything like that, just friends. I like having a female friend (she is one of the very few) and although we did care for each other a lot it was just friendship.

Well fast forward everything was going well, like it always does, she literally texted me two weeks ago sharing me a meme (we do that often). Then about 3 days later I texted her just saying hi and got nothing back... it was very strange for that to happen because she always texts back. I shrugged it off and about 2 days after I texted again and got nothing. That's where I started to have worries. I texted again and asked if she is getting my messages and nothing. I then went on snapchat (she doesn't have any other social media, just snapchat) and her little avatar thingy was just a blank person. I tried sending a text on there and it said ""message failed"".

I start getting this sinking feeling in my stomach as I discovered this when I was at the bar and I asked my friend and he told me that ""message failed"" means she blocked you. I'm in complete disbelief. I don't understand why she would block me after 10 years of friendship?

She does have a discord account and I messaged her on there and just asked her if she lost her phone or something because nothing was going through. It said she was online but shortly after sending the message it said she was offline.
_____
*I am heart broken about this. I know we were only friends but I did love her like family and this is killing me inside how she did me like this. The only thing I can think of is she had a boyfriend who she recently broke up with. He didn't like me even though I never once made a move on her or gave him any reason not to like me. She broke up with him several weeks ago. I'm guessing they got together and he told her not to ever talk to me again. Or something like that.*

I'm still hoping that her phone got lost or something but this whole thing has been about 2 weeks now and I am friends with her on reddit (this is a throwaway account) and see that she's still posting on there.

I know the answer is to move on and forget about her, but man is that so hard to do. I cannot believe someone would do me in like that without a single word about it. I would have understood if she had just told me she couldn't contact me anymore. I would at least then have closure. But this leaving without saying a single word is like torture and is eating away at me. 

Anyway... any advice would be helpful on how to get over this. I'm going to stop trying to contact her... oh and she lives about 4 hours away and recently moved so going to see her in person isn't really an option. Not that I would if I could because it's obvious she wants nothing to do with me anymore. 

TL;DR - my friend of 10 years randomly blocked me and started ignoring me for seemingly no reason, there was no fight, we talked to each other recently before without issue and yet she still managed to block me without a word. I'm feeling horrible about this and need advice on how to get over losing someone close to you in this way without any closure. "
"I’ve (23/F) reached the point where I want nothing to do with my family.


I grew up in the South. Full of judgmental people. People who care so much about appearances, they will pretend their lives are perfect when they’re not. No one acknowledges failure. I have been here for my 23 years and I’m ready to get out.  

I am very very close to leaving. Moving very far away. Have a job offer elsewhere. And it has me thinking that I just want to cut my family off. Not so completely that I never speak to them. But I will no longer be forced to attend family events or visit as often. 

I have always been the black sheep of my family. I have always been focused on my career. I don’t want kids. I’m outspoken and I talk about my feelings. Completely opposite of my family. Everyone here gets married young, has babies, and never leaves. 

Don’t get me wrong, growing up I loved spending time with my family. Things got rocky after my dad killed himself. Some difficult things happened to me in college as well. Things between me and my partner at the time. (I would explain further but then my post would be removed). And no one in my family would acknowledge it. They knew what was happening to me and no one would even reach out to me. 

I had to pull myself out of that situation by myself. And I made it. And still no one will acknowledge it. No one once ever asked me if I was okay. After coming close to losing my life. 

Recently I had a falling out with my sister. I was depressed and she completely shut me out. Tried to manipulate me back into her life when her husband accused her of having an affair. Come to find out she actually was having an affair. Got caught and then did it again. Only my parents know. But now she’s pregnant. My first thought was “Whose is it?”. They are so blinded by the perfect image of this perfect family, they don’t even want to face the facts. That this baby may not be her husbands. 

My sister has also treated my mom like shit and my mom refuses to acknowledge it. Everyone in my family thinks my sister is God’s gift to man. Even though she the most immature person. And she’s almost 30. 

And I just can’t take it anymore. I’m currently sitting in a random parking lot so I don’t have to listen to the bullshit. 

I’m just tired of pretending all the time. Tired of not having a family I can turn to when I need help. The only person I can talk to is my mom. And it took me a long time to forgive her but I did. 

Everyone here makes me feel guilty that I want to leave. But why is it so wrong to cut out people who are toxic? 

TL;DR: I’m tired of my toxic family and I want out. "
"I (36m) am feeling absolutely awful about my GF(35f) going to a concert which will play a song which majorly triggers her about her emotional affair partner of just a few months ago. Am I being irrational?


This is a long story so I'll make it brief.

My  girfriend of 5 years who I have a child with.  She formed a friendship  and then fell in love with someone she trains with and it all got  majorly messy.  She wanted to leave me for him but he did not  reciprocate the romantic feelings and did not want to be with her.

There  was a lot of lying and confusion over a long period of time and I was  obviously left heartbroken.  Even more heartbroken that she was  heartbroken by his rejection.  I was literally a fall back option and  I've stuck it out because I love her and we have a child and she says it  was all a big mistake.  But I know that she genuinely wanted to be with  him and was left feeling heartbroken when he didn't feel the same.  It  was a horrible time.

During  their considerable texting, she showed interest in all his favorite  music and developed a liking for a band he liked and one particular song  became ""their"" song.  I know it is a triggering song for her and brings  back memories of her and him, she told me he used to sing it for her,  and she deleted it off her playlist because of the memories it brought  back.

She  has now cut off contact with him but this is still quite fresh for all  of us and I absolutely can't stand even hearing the name of this band  now let alone the song in question.

She  texts me the other day telling me about this concert she wants to go  to...it's that band.  I reacted with extreme anxiety and got really  upset and told her I didn't want her to go because I don't want her to  be triggered by that song.  Seeing it live will be even more of a  powerful experience and I'm just so scared it will make her feel the  feelings she used to have for him which I really want to be forgotten.

When  I told her I didn't want her to go we ended up having a massive row.   She tried to underplay the significance of that song even though SHE  took the step to delete it from her playlist.  She made me feel stupid  about being upset by all this.

I'm  jealous that he had a song with her, I'm jealous that she showed so  much interest in all his stuff and lost interest in mine.  This band is  just a bad memory for me.  It was during a time I was constantly on edge  because she was texting him so much and falling for him, and she  suddenly starts listening to this band and this song with dazed  love-struck eyes.

I've explained in depth why I feel this way and she has invalidated all my feelings and I feel so stupid.

I  guess I just need to get over it and remember it's just a song and a  band.  But to me it's the reminder of one of the biggest heartbreaks of  my life and I am SO dreading the day of the concert when her mind will  be sent back to that time when she was in love with another man.

Am  I being irrational?  I wanted her to just not go and understand my  feelings, but she told me I was being hilarious and told me that ME  mentioning him is more of a trigger than the song itself.  I know this  isn't true.  I know what this song means.   I totally get that she wants  to go to this concert but isn't the pain it will cause me more  important than a concert?

TL:DR - My girlfriend is going to a concert of a band which she only got into because of the guy she fell in love with and almost left me over.  I don't want her to go because it's just such a painful reminder of the worst time of my life.  She told me I was being ""hilarious""."
"My boyfriend [20] keeps insulting me [20] as a joke, and it’s starting to make me feel bad.


As the title says, my boyfriend of 2 years is a jokester. He jokes around with everyone including me. I don’t mind him joking around. Sometimes it’s actually really funny. But other times, it really hurts my feelings. I might be overreacting, but whenever he calls me dumb, gross, annoying and a bitch, it kinda lowers my self esteem. He says he’s just joking when he notices it affects my mood. What should I do?

*TL;DR: Boyfriend jokes around a lot and sometimes it makes me feel down. I truly love him though, since at other times he’s absolutely the sweetest.*"
"Boyfriend (25M) of nearly 5 years expressing doubt in his ability to commit long term to me (26F) due to inexperience with other people


Throwaway here. Sorry this is kind of long to provide additional context.

My boyfriend (25M) and I (26F) have been dating for 4.75 years, started right at the end of college; during that time we've had normal ups and downs and I've had several moments of doubt in our relationship, however he never has voiced any. Generally however, I would say we have a very, very good relationship, filled with mutual respect, love, intellectual stimulation, and a good balance of power. Not everything is perfect. I love him and he says he loves me frequently. I feel like he loves me and I know that a breakup would likely be devastating and difficult for both of us. We have lived together for the majority (4 years) of our relationship, and have two cats.

A few months ago, I became worried about what the future looked like for us. I'm in a stable, well-paying job which I really enjoy, and he was coming to the end of an election position and would soon be looking for a new job. I don't really want to leave my job as I've been in it for less than a year, and I worried that this was confining him to looking for jobs in our present city that doesn't have a ton of opportunity in the field that he would like to work in. I questioned whether he thought this relationship was progressing toward marriage because I wasn't sure we should be making these kinds of career decisions for a relationship that wasn't. He told me that he saw himself with me for the long haul, but he said that he didn't know if he wanted to ever get married. For some context, most of the marriages that he has experienced (his parents and an oversharing uncle) have ended in divorce and a lot of vocal bitterness. No one in my family has ever divorced. I was even just thinking that my cousins who are married (all older than me, in their late 30s, early 40s), were also still married to their first spouses. The way we come into viewing these relationships is different: he sees a legal contract that makes people miserable when it ends, whereas I see it as a natural progression in a relationship that shows that you feel like you're done looking for other people and allows for a unique kind of relationship building and trust to form. My high school boyfriend and I dated for three years and I always felt like since I hadn't felt real heartbreak, I allowed myself to be vulnerable and love someone in a way I haven't been able to since. Not that I'm in love with my high school boyfriend or have any residual feelings for him, I just think that experience locked a piece of me away that I don't want to give to anyone without that commitment. I don't know if this is true or rational, but it feels that way.

Since the election ended, he says his depression has gotten worse and his psychiatrist upped his antidepressant to see if that helped. Meanwhile, we've had a friend move into our spare bedroom, which has majorly stressed me out. I've been ready for him to leave. I've also started taking both Adderall and Strattera which work well for me, but often leave me feeling hungover and snappy after I get home from work.

Last night, he broke down and said the thought of breaking up has been circling in his head constantly for the last two weeks and he can't bottle it up. He said he doesn't want to get married and if that's what I want he doesn't want to take that away from me. I explained that I've since come to terms with the idea of not getting married, but what I am looking for is a long term, stable partner, which he said he also wanted. However, he also said that he doesn't feel like he can fully settle into that commitment given that he's only ever dated or had sex with me and he feels like this relationship came too early in life for him. I have dated casually quite a bit, the three year high school boyfriend, as well as a 6-8 month relationship in college prior to this one. He worries that he's reaching an age where people are starting to settle down and there won't be options for him to get this experience.

He suggested a break for ""I'm not sure how long"" and I told him that I don't want to do a break, I would rather just fully break up. I also said that an open relationship is not an option for me and explained that what he was putting on the line was our relationship, which again, by all accounts is a very good, happy, functional relationship. I love my boyfriend, but he is not exactly the type that girls fall over themselves for – he's a bit of an acquired taste. I'm very worried that a breakup would end up with him lonely and very depressed. I told him I didn't know how to handle this sex issue and in the end it was his decision; however I seriously doubted we would get back together if he made that decision. He asked why, as if he didn't understand. I know myself – I think I would be resentful and I would never be able to look at the relationship or trust him the same way and, even if it weren't true, I would always think that those thoughts were still in the back of his head and know that he didn't think I was enough or right or best for him. We currently have very mismatched libidos – he is happy with sex maybe twice a month and very rarely initiates, I could have it twice a day most days and am frequently turned down. It blows my mind that of all possible concerns, not having had sex with other people is the one that makes him think he couldn't commit to our relationship long term.

In the end, we discussed how long he had been feeling this way and he told me it had only been the last two weeks. Looking at all the things that have changed in our lives in the last two weeks (his job ending and not knowing what it was he wanted to do, my new medication which frequently makes me want to lay in bed for hours after I get home, and me also being very stressed out by and trying to hide from our new roommate), I wondered if that had any impact on these thoughts. He says that he has felt like I have pushed him away and left him alone for far too long (which, I have) and cited several recent incidents. He spends too much time in bed during the day while I'm at work and doesn't want to lay in bed when I get home, which I completely understand and I have always told him to go ahead and go downstairs. This had made him feel rejected and lonelier. His sleep schedule has been wonky and we haven't been falling asleep at the same time. He thinks that these combined factors may have brought this idea to the forefront of his mind.

We decided to ask the roommate to leave ASAP and I will work on figuring out how to minimize the side effects of the Adderall  and ask my doctor for a medication change in January when I see him next. I offered to stop taking it entirely, but he told me that he didn't want me to stop taking something that worked so well. We are going to work on developing more structure for him so that he feels less useless and lonely at home. I also told him to go ahead and look for jobs in other cities – I've felt like we were going to move at some point soon in the future anyway and I have always thought I would move with him. I am also going to try to encourage him to reconnect with friends and spend time with people, especially while I'm at work.

We were cuddling afterwards and he told me he feels so relieved and much better – I do not. I've had knots in my stomach since we talked. I obviously know these conversations are very important and am very glad we talked about it before it came to something much worse - however, I keep coming back to his feeling like he should see other people before he can actually know this is the right relationship for him. The whole time we were talking he just kept saying that he didn't want to break up, he didn't want to break up, but he felt like maybe we should.

I have a lot of uncertainty right now. In all of the doubts I've had about this relationship, I've never felt less secure. Do people actually get over the need to feel like they've ""played the field"" before settling down? Is that a reasonable thing to really worry about threating our relationship long term? Is it likely that the stressors we’ve identified are actually the source of these feelings or are we dealing with something larger? Should I be thinking about an exit plan?

With all of this now being said, if he does find a job in a new city, if you were in my shoes would you move with him?

Tl;dr: Boyfriend and I have very good relationship but are at a shit or get off the pot point and he feels like his inexperience with other relationships will prevent him from ever being able to commit. He was suddenly thinking we need to break up, but we identified stressors that may have brought these feelings up and he no longer feels like we should. I’m feeling very nervous and insecure. 

Thanks for reading and any and all advice!

"Me [21M] having constant arguments with my mom [43F]


To give a little background about my relationship with my mom and parents in general. I do love them, but from my point of view my mom is being overprotective with me at an age where I think I can handle myself. I still live with my mom and my dad is working abroad (he comes every month for a week). I'm in university and I do have a part time job and also a full time job in the past (during the summer I had a full time job as a programmer and this also part time job, I wanted to save up some money), but for now I didn't see moving out as a smart decision from my side. My university is in the same city and even though I live quite far from the center of the city, I can deal with it. 

&amp;#x200B;

But lately it's been quite hard to deal with my parents, especially my mom. I would like to mention that I don't pay any amenities to the house and neither for the food that I eat at home, so my parents still support me through college from that point of view. The first year of university I paid myself and the second and third year (which I currently am) are paid by the gorvernment because of my grades. The issues with my mom are honestly because we see life different, she has the idea that finishing college and getting the degree will be everything I need to do in order to succeed in life. I'm studying Computer Engineering and there is some truth in that, college does help, but at the same time it's only a small part of what you have to do in order to achieve certain things and I want more from life than a 30 years loan on a house, a 5 year loan on a car that I renew every 5 years, 2 kids and a wife. Besides those differences, lately I've been going through a bit of a rough period, my salary at the part time job got smaller, I went through an ugly breakup with someone that I loved and it was quite a mess. Besides the issues that I had in the past (the fact that I couldn't afford to study abroad and had to stay in the country and so on), a lot of things added up. I felt quite depressed to be honest and lost.

&amp;#x200B;

So I decided to go London for a few days as a break and to take things a little bit easier (I paid for the trip, not my parents). I also decided to go out a little more and last night I stayed until later at night. I came home at around 3 AM, I did not drink, or did any drugs, I just wanted to hang out with some friends and have fun. Today I called my mom, she was at work and she acted like I drove drunk or that I did drugs and went home fully intoxicated. She said I'm a weak person and that she regrets the way I grew up to be and she compared me to a friend's child because he is a strong person because he doesn't go out as much and he listens to his parents. And it annoys me so much because I know that person, he is a distant friend of mine that never worked a day in his life, his mom drives him to university even though he has a driving license and she pays his tuition. Yeah, he doesn't go out as much, but why is that a good thing?

As you can imagine I didn't take those things well and I don't know how to act. I'm almost turning 22 years old, I can manage to move out by taking my older full time job, but at the same time, it is quite expensive and I won't be able to save up.

&amp;#x200B;

 **tl;dr**: I've had a lot of arguments with my mom and today was quite a mess after I stayed out late."
"My [23F] boyfriend [26M] bought an apartment with his twin brother without running it by me


We've been dating for almost 4 years. We had our ups and downs but I knew he is the one I wanted to marry from the beginning. We never talked serious about our exact future plans mostly because I have 2 more years still at university. 
My parents told me they have enough savings to buy us an apartment when I decide to move out, get married and my boyfriend knew that they are ready to help out. His parents went through a nasty divorce mostly because of division of assets and his relationship with parents is almost non existent. 

One day he comes and says that he and his identical twin brother want to move out of their parents house and they looked for an apartments together. He didn't ask for my oppinion or advice, it was more like an annoucement. He said they are looking at building that is just starting the counstrucion. It will be ready to move in in about 2,5 years. He said they went to the bank and they are going to take a loan for almost the whole price of the apartment and it will take 6 years to pay it back together. After they pay it off they are going to take another loan to buy a second apartment for twin brother and then they will start living apart.  

I was shocked what I'm hearing. I felt betrayed that he didn't ask what I would think of it. I tried to keep my cool down and when I said that I'm dissapointed that he is making future plans with his brother instead of me he attacked me for not being happy for him. 

I tried to explain that he should have talked to me about something that is impacting me as well. That means we will keep dating for the next 6 years on the same level as we did these past 4 years. We can start living together only when they buy second apartment. 

I was also mad that he is going to live the next 12 years in debt. He could have waited for me to finish the university, save some money instead and pay half the price of the apartment while other half pay my parents. When I said that is the better financial solution, he said his father told him to have his own properties before getting married. He is talking from his experience from divorce. So I got even more angry that he is already protecting himself from divorce.

After our talk he told me that apartment is for us, that is why he insisted on buying a bigger one so we could have enough space for future children. I'm just feeling so sad and lost right now. I love him but I haven't imagined us starting our life  together when I'm 29.

 I don't know how to proceed this relationship or how to be happy for him. 

TL;DR  Boyfriend bought an apartment with his twin brother without consulting with me. My parents were ready to help us two buy an apartment. We can't start our life together for the next 6 years until his twin brother moves.

"Partner (31M) and I (22F) of 1 year in crisis after infidelity, have some questions.


Good afternoon, I'm posting from a throwaway as I am a very frequent Reddit user. 

My partner and I are recently in a struggle after I discovered infidelity on his part. His previous partner of 5 years (Lets call her Olga) cheated on him for the last 8 months of their relationship with a mutual acquaintance of theirs (Let's call him Luigi), then they broke up. We met and started dating shortly afterwards, but unbeknownst to me he was still in contact with Olga, and allowed her to visit him (her idea) for two days back in March while we were temporarily long distance. He went through with it/was in contact with her as he wanted to ""break up"" her new relationship with Luigi and hurt them like they hurt him. Claims they weren't physical but I don't believe it.

Later he remained in intermittent contact with Olga to discuss logistics of when he could return to their old apartment in Germany to collect the last of his things. Prior to the end of our long distance, as he knew I would return soon, he finally visited their old apartment one weekend in August. She told him when her and her new partner would be out, he flew to Germany, went to the apartment and ripped up/shredded/broke the furniture as he was the one who bough it in the first place (Verified by Google Maps timeline, messages I have found, and third party confirmation), left after 45 minutes, and took the next flight out. They ceased contact.

I moved back to this country in September for University and caught everything in October by snooping. This obviously was a huge blow, and we have fought a lot since. I told Luigi his girlfriend was cheating on him by WhatsApp, then Olga texted me with death threats, it was extremely trashy to be honest. On top of that, he was using cam-sites (although I later verified he never paid or communicated with them) and sexted prostitutes at the beginning of our relationship (although he swears it was just for sexting/boredom and that he never actually met up, the evidence thus far surprisingly corroborates his story). He also deleted/erased as much as he could so who knows if there was more really.

After all of the drama and due to many circumstances, I've decided to reluctantly move forward as I did move countries and switch degrees to be with this man. He has done a lot to show remorse (confessed to his family, apologised, took me on vacation to a neighboring country, gave me all of his passwords/accounts, deleted the camsites, let me see phone records/all e-mails/texts/etc. whenever I want, keeps buying me presents, blocked her on all media, etc.) however I still have zero trust, am extremely emotional and angry and have meltdowns often, and I've demanded couple's counseling. 

That being said, I have never been to couple's counseling and have no idea what to expect. We found one who both of us like who has his own youtube channel, is married, has lots of degrees in psychology and seems really genuine. We will be scheduling an appointment today. What are some red flags to look out for while choosing/entering into therapy? How do I know if we are wasting money or really taking proper advantage of the service? What are some good recommendations besides this that can help us move forward given that we both work on it? He has already bought me health insurance which just finally went through (also very upset at him for being slow with this) so we can get STD tested.

Lastly, last night Olga sent him an e-mail, the first time in ages, saying in broken Spanish ""Hi (partner;s name) how are you? I knew to say it when I knew it. That he was just temporary."" And nothing else. Olga is a native Russian/German speaker, Luigi is native Italian, I'm a native English speaker and partner is native Spanish, just for clarity, so we have. He texted me and told me as soon as he read it, didn't delete it nor reply, and said this is the first contact she's sent him since everything.  I'm thinking of us just forwarding it to her current partner or writing a nasty e-mail, but not sure what to do, and don't want to just ignore it.   


I was also thinking of just contacting Luigi's family members through facebook with some screencaps of her communications to Partner and my communications with her and Luigi and basically saying that he's with a serial cheater to just make shit hit the fan because I'm annoyed and want them to be hurt just like I've been and basically perma-fuck her relationship with his family (and i feel that this e-mail was sent basically means their relationship isn't going well), but his family will probably all be Italian, and maybe he had her send that e-mail just to bait us, I really don't know. I think all of this mutual cheating and this weird revenge-fest between them is gross but at the same time I'm really angry and hurt and want my own revenge too so I kind of understand it in a weird way...

\*\*Tl;dr: Partner was unfaithful emotionally and probably physically, we are going to couple's counseling but it'll be our first time in therapy, questions about that. Also, his former affair partner/ex contacted him last night and not sure what to do with this e-mail. Upset and want to watch the world burn. Help.\*\*

"Who’s wrong in this situation?


Sorry, for this being so long, but I feel its necessary so here it goes...

My girl(29) and me(31) have been together almost 4 years, but have been on and off for 4 times. I take responsibility that 2 are my fault in not being financially responsible (which made us separate from our apartment) and me being a general asshole (on the topic of marriage and having kids). I have bipolar and love this woman enough to go down to veterans affairs outpatient clinic to get the medication and counseling I need. I’m in a state of mind that I am happier than ever. My opinion on marriage and kids have changed since being around her little boy who has autism. I love being with her and this child and can’t imagine life without them and from what I see from her she feels the same. 

The problem is that she is always pressuring me into marriage and I feel that that’s a big step. I’m against it for the time being because I want to give the her child, our future children, and her a life that they have no worries for the future. She is wanting it because from what she told me she is getting older and needs reassurance since we’ve been together for so long. I told her we have broken up quite a few times and need to fix us first before marriage is an idea. 

My question is am I in the wrong for wanting to wait or is she wrong for thinking that’s the reason marriage should be between us? There’s so much more, but I’m trying to keep this short, even though it’s not. Anything is appreciate, thanks!

Tl;dr: Am I wrong for wanting to wait for stability to get married or is she wrong for wanting to marry because she’s getting older and reassurance?

"girl (17F) doesn't want to meet up with me(17M)


 We have met up 4 times once just us 2 the other times in groups and on all the occasions she was laughing and having fun. The time we met up alone she had told her friend that she had a really good time and it was fun. Now I try and organize plans there are different excuses and it's starting to make me wonder wtf is up. She talks to me online fine we play games together chill and talk either in a group or just the 2 of us. She says I'm one the closest people to her and so is this other guy. When I asked her what's going on she said she is really busy but actually wants to meet up but the thing is she meets up with her other friends. She even has said to me she wants to watch a certain movie together but when I tried to make plans she was busy and ended up watching it with her sister. Idc she watched with her sister that's family but when I said to go somewhere else she is busy.

"How can I (F23) deal with this personal issues that are affecting my life?


Starting from last summer (July) I have been showing signs of depression - I had trouble falling asleep (sometimes would take up to 3 hours) or I would wake up an hour earlier without sleeping back, I lost appetite and as a result a little bit of weight, during day my head would hurt and I would not be able to concentrate, I would be moody or forget things etc.

Watching a video yesterday, I also fit the symptoms of Child's Emotional Neglect (leading to my fear of commitment).

While writing this, I feel like self deprecating and selfish, I feel upset at the idea of disappointing people in my life. That makes me unable to trully enjoy passions I have. But, the thing is this is temporary and if I find something inspiring that disappears for a while.

I know I have a lot to give, but I feel unable to without fearing I do not have the confidence to do so. 

 I do not need therapy, I want to fine some ways to bring me back to normal, to be all other people.

For people who struggled with those, how can I deal with all these?

TLDR; Suffering from issues that have marked my childhood, but which I ignored all along. Now, they are comming back and creating me fear of commitment or idealistic ideas over how relationships work. For the last half of year, I had some mild depression which might be rooted in that.

"My (19 M) friend is a little to touchy with me (19 F) to be just a friend.


I have a recently made a new friend through mutual friends. The first time we met and hung out, I felt that he was a little too touchy for just meeting for the first time. He would touch my hands, shoulders, knees, play with my hair, or just try to have contact with me in general. He also does that thing where guys will rub one part of your arm or hand etc, making patterns and such. At first I thought it was maybe because he is a touchy kind of friend but I've learned it is generally just with me and not with our other girl friends. The thing is though, he has a girlfriend and it's not like he never talks about her. I just know that if I knew my boyfriend was touching other girls as so casually as he touches me, I would not be okay. In our friend group we always say we love each other and or referring to each other as friends and valuing each other, but when it comes to me, he just mentions how he really values me. So where is my confirmation of being friends? He tells me a lot of sappy shit about how he wants to get to know me better, that I'm so pretty which is fine since we're friends and all but he says it, A LOT. And that when he first met me he knew I was gonna be in his life for a long time but never once does he refer to me as being a good friend.

"I'm [17F] having lingering issues with my mom [47F]


Hi.

I've been really stressed out the past few days because I've been remembering stuff from my childhood. I've always had anxiety issues and been kinda wimpy. I'm really afraid of planes and going to far away places in general but my mom would frequently take me to see my grandparents who live in another state. The plane rides were always hell for me. I wouldn't be able to sleep properly for the nights leading up to me going and on the day of the flights I would get very sick and I would shake the whole time we were in the airport. The actual plane rides were much worse. I couldn't eat, sleeping was hard because of how loud people were and most of the time I just had to kinda sit on the plane and get sick. My mom would usually give me sleeping medicine which would help but then I'd wake up feeling hot and sick again with hours left on the plane ride. After we'd get off the plane we'd have to go get the luggage and then about a 2 hour drive which made me feel just as sick. Meanwhile my grandparents would call me a drama queen along with my mom. I felt like I never had a say in going or not. My mom would just tell me we were going to go see my grandparents and that was it. Even if I begged not to go I still had to. Sometimes while we were at the airport she would be really annoyed because I would be crying or getting sick a lot and I'd be bothering her. 

I am terribly afraid of going to anywhere that's far away from home now because I feel like if something happens to me or if I don't feel right no one will listen to me and I'll be stuck there. Car rides are pretty bad for me unless I go with my dad. Riding in a car alone is next to impossible for me because I get pretty bad anxiety attacks. 

After my mom broke up with my dad (they weren't married and never went to court for custody of me, but for the most part I tried to stay with my dad.) she married a man that she cheated on my dad with who absolutely despised me. He would yell at me and one time he even hit me. My mom wanted me to be homeschooled and she said she ""didn't know math very well"" so he was the one to teach me math. He taught me basic things like addition and multiplication. If I didn't understand a concept rather quickly he would yell at me and get frustrated at me and told me I was hopeless. He was never nice to me. He always made it clear that he hated me. I would cry to my mom, sometimes she would make him give a half-assed apology and another time she said ""You aren't abused, you have no reason to cry"". I would cry to go to my dad's house and she would say ""You stay with your dad too much"" but now whenever I bring that up she claims she never did that and she always let me see my dad when I wanted. She didn't. 

I ended up pretty much only staying with my dad. My mom constantly demanded child support even though I wasn't living with her. My dad did not give her the money. My mom wasn't paying for anything in regards to me except for when I would go see her which was rare. She held onto my social security number, my insurance, everything. She still to this day holds onto these and when I try to ask about filing for my dad's insurance she flips out and says that she always pays for everything for me (she doesn't.) and had filed me on her welfare and food stamps which I don't see any of. She wasn't approved for insurance since the process works differently in the state she's in(? not sure what my dad meant when he tried explaining this to me), so now I do not have insurance. My dad doesn't want to get her into legal trouble by filing for food stamps/etc with me on it because he says it'll cause investigations to see where I actually live. We cannot afford a lawyer for filing for child support which is why we haven't fought for any of that stuff. We can't afford a lot, my dad's foodstamps got denied again but my grandfather is helping us. My mom lives in another state now and constantly talks about the money issues she has. She lives in a luxury apartment with a full kitchen, an expensive mixer and runs a makeup shop. She has an iphone and her boyfriend owns multiple gaming consoles. She owns 2 scooters. But I can't afford to buy basic things like deodorant. 

There's a lot more but when I try to bring up things like that she either says she didn't do anything wrong or she spins it in some way to say she was the victim. She says her husband was depressed- even if he was, she didn't consider leaving him. Even after he hit me. I was 8 years old. He smacked me very hard. She says she's sorry but she always has an excuse about whatever happened. Or she tells me I remembered something wrong. I don't know if there's something wrong with me. Was what my mom did okay? Am I just expecting too much? My dad is a really good dad to me and hasn't ever done the things my mom did but I still feel like I'm just being an entitled kid. There's more stuff my mom did but these are the most important ones that've been bothering me the past few days. I'm sorry if I made this too long. I wasn't sure what to include. 

**tl;dr I'm still bothered about things that happened in my childhood with my mom, not sure if I was expecting too much, can't understand why my mom did the things that she did**"
"My friend [27f] used to be a racist right wing activist, now is a far left wing SJW. I'm glad she rethought her stances but how to tell her that her tactics are still toxic?


I have been friends with ""Melissa"" since I was a kid and we had a very intense childhood together. We were both in abusive situations and both had parents who weren't totally social normal, so we had a hard time fitting in in our wealthy town. Melissa and I were both very smart, bright lower class girls with severe ADHD (me inattentive type, her mixed type). So we were not liked by our parents, teachers, peers, or our peers parents.

This changed in high school as I have the quietly daydreaming, spaced out form of ADHD, I was quiet and therefore accepted enough to be taken on as a ""project"" by certain peers and their parents, and they helped me become more socially normal. I then went on to college and a normal life.

Melissa went the opposite way as she had a loud and brash personality, she started acting out in various ways, got in fights, was not accepted by the ""successful"" parents and their children, started hanging out with ""the wrong crowd,"" dropped out of school, then married very young and got pregnant.

I gave the backstory to explain why I stayed friends with Melissa through all of this, I had a VERY intense childhood with Melissa and there were quite a few times she was the only person their for me, and we sort of got put on separate tracks in life for really shitty reasons. I care a lot about Melissa and she's very important to me. 

So when Melissa first got married it was to a hardcore libertarian. They were involved in extreme libertarian groups. Even though they called themselves libertarian, in theory supporting everyone's rights and freedoms, I refer to them as right wing because that's basically what they were. They were extremely obsessed with guns and amassed quite the collection of guns. They had their young daughter practicing shooting with a pink gun. They were highly racist and engaged in lots of scare tactics against people of color. It was clear there was a lot of fearmongering within their groups about how they needed to arm themselves in case they got attacked by people of color. They would post all kinds of things to this effect on social media.

I stayed connected to Melissa through this time on social media because I felt like it was important for her to stay connected to at least one normal person. She had the influence of her husband and all these right wing libertarian gun groups that she was in. And they moved to locations in the country that have more of these people. So she was in all these echo chambers. How would she ever get out of them if she never heard any other voices? So she would post this crazy stuff and from time to time, I would post a ""well, actually..."" sort of reply debunking it.

Melissa is smart and has always had a good heart, but she went through a lot of shit and I think in this period she was lashing out at the world with all her rage. But I felt like due to who she was underneath, there was a chance she would come around.


Well it took almost 10 years, but Melissa did come around... ALL the way around. Like too far around. And so did her husband, who was the one who was into the libertarian gun stuff in the first place!!! Both of them are constantly posting intense social justice warrior stuff. Both of them are white, their friends are all white, and they live in just about the whitest area of the country, but a LOT of what they post is about how horrible and racist white people are for doing a variety of … fairly normal things. They have gotten REALLY into the call-out aspect of being a SJW and use a lot of slang that's used in those situations. For example, Melissa will post things like, ""It's just like whites to wait until the last day of a hotel checkout to bother to tip their maid! I see you Becky!!!""

Like, I remember eating at an IHOP with Melissa and her husband when they first got married and covering their part of the tip when I was a student and hardly had money for myself, let alone two other people -- because they proudly declared that they ""don't tip at a place like IHOP.""

If she even wanted to call people's attention to workers who rely on tips and why it's better to tip every day instead of all on the last day, it would be great, but it seemed like all she wanted to do was yell at people.

Like it's great to call out white people for racism but it seems like what is mainly appealing it to them is just the chance to yell at other people and be superior to them in a socially acceptable way.

Like during their racist years they were being superior to POC, but eventually they folded under the fact that that was not socially acceptable. However, yelling at people and accusing them of being racist is a socially acceptable way to act superior to others.

It wouldn't be troublesome to me if I saw them doing ANY other form of activism, but this is basically all they do. 

I have known a lot of activists over the years and I have seen the amounts of hard work that go into social justice activism on even a basic, ""amateur,"" level, all the phone calls people make, going door to door flyering, ringing doorbells, making petitions and getting signatures, phone banking, fundraising, donating and so on and so on. 

Again, Melissa is not a bad person, if you broke down on the highway in the middle of the night she'd drive for hours to pick you up, if you had no money she'd go without lunch so she could buy you something to eat, and so on. She is not a hater, but I'm hoping she can find a form of political engagement that is less about being a hater. The reason why it bothers me in this instance is that I feel like her negative call-out posts are not achieving anything and instead they are turning people off and driving them away.

tl;dr: My friend [27f] used to be a racist right wing activist, now is a far left wing SJW. I'm glad she rethought her stances but how to tell her that her tactics are still toxic?"

"Closer than we’ve ever been but further away than ever


My boyfriend (21 M) and I (21 F) have lived together for about 4 months now. I always imagined living together we would grow closer but I have never felt so alone in my relationship. I couldn’t believe that after 2.5 years we don’t eat together, we don’t sleep in the same bed, I basically have to beg for some time to cuddle or to sleep together but I am usually met with a “but why?”. 


I don’t spend much time with him, he normally is playing video games and talking to people online until late hours at night. I don’t feel like he is as interested in me as the games he plays and our short conversations never match up to the hours he spends laughing with people he’s never even met. 


I feel so jealous and wonder what I’m doing wrong and what I can do to make him want to spend time with me. If I am being honest I feel so alone and I find myself missing former boyfriends and flings that were not the healthiest. They may not have been the right person for me in the long run, but they made me feel wanted in that moment in the same way I wish my boyfriend felt about me now. I feel so guilty about it. 

TL;DR- my boyfriend spends more time playing video games than with me and I find myself missing people who gave me attention. "
"I think my fiancee has been cheating on me on her trip abroad


I apologize in advance if this post doesnt belong here 

I am engaged to my highschool sweetheart, we've been together for almost 4 years, moved out of the country for our studies after 11 months of our relationship and soon after started living together.  

We fought relatively frequently, but neither one of us wanted to lose each other as we became very dependant of each other and under normal circumstances I could say that we are incredibly in love and happy together. 

But this is where the problem starts, over the course of three months she went abroad for a job intership abroad, where she lived with her best friend. 
We already knew how to keep a long distance relationship, especially since we knew that it wouldn't be a long amount of time before she returns.  
But she gave me a lot of red flags while being at the trip, incredibly busy over the day with work, rarely available to reach at nights because of her friends, poor internet or (insert another reason here) 
At one instance, she accused me of being very controlling when I tried to call her at night to talk, and she refused to pick up. Once she even told me because of her health issues (which she rarely mentioned during the last 3 years) she thinks its the best to split up. 
I told her if its the health issues that are the reasons for the break up, I will stay with her until we overcome it together, but if there's a single other reason I understand and accept the breaking up. 
She told me its just the health problems, so we stayed together.  
As the three months passed, we improved our communication drastically, she was still giving me bad vibes occasionally; since her laptop was in our house once I even invaded her privacy and opened her conversations, which were completely deleted. 

The day she came home she seemed overflowing with happiness, we spent the entire day making love and laughing, simply enjoying being reconnected. 

Then we talked about our issues while she was abroad, the health problems and so on.  She told me she doesnt know why she treated me like shit most of the time, blamed it on her health issues which are ridiculously irrelevant and are not a reason to and a long term relationship. A lot of things dont add up, but she promises that she remained faithful and she never done anything I wouldnt approve of. 

The stuff not making sense keeps me up at night, so I ask her to see her conversation with the best friend she stayed over at, she tells me she can show it to me in the morning, which I stupidly accept.
The next morning comes, I wake up to breakfast and coffee, we have it together and I ask for her about the phone, when she tells me her friend asked her to delete the conversation so I dont see her (the friends) selfies or private pictures - due to her insecurities or whatever reason she made up. We talk about all the guys she mentioned there, the deleted conversations, nights when she wouldnt answer my calls and ofcourse her ""sickness"" that forced her to ask for a break up. 
Her answers, summarized were all in the context of ""I have not cheated"", ""I dont know why I ignored you those nights"" and ""I got worried for my health so I wanted to break it up"". A lot more things that dont add up. 

Ofcourse I get pissed off, but I look past it, she was giving me nothing but attention and affection, was focusing on our life together and our studies, so I neglected all my doubts. 

Im talking about this now, although it happened around two months ago, because her best friend is visiting us for the weekend. 
I have no intentions of interrogating the friend because if my fiancee is hiding something, she d probably make sure her friend doesnt spill the beans. 

I hate the way I currently feel, our relationship was built on mutual effort and trust for 4 years, and I seem like I am completely losing trust in her, because no matter how much I try I cant seem to make sense of the story she told me about her trip abroad. 

 Currently Im in a position where I dont know what to do, she seems very happy and committed to this relationship, and I would feel like shit if I'm being this skeptic and upset over nothing, but I cannot get over my gut feeling that she cheated on me during her trip. 

Any advice on how to overcome my insecurities, or similar experiences/advices from you guys would be incredibly welcome. 

(We plan on getting married after university, we both wear our engagement rings, but I guess they serve the purpose of promise rings more, since we do not have a date of our wedding, if it makes sense)

Tl;dr: My girlfriend acted strangely on her trip abroad, ignored me for days and deleted all her pictures and messages from that time period.
My gut feeling is killing me inside since none of her stories add up but I would feel horrible if I lose her over my dumb insecurities"
"I (31M) am having a hard time trusting partner (37F). Are these red flags?


Tl;dr at the bottom! 


Hey there. I have some really big issues when it comes to trusting my gf.  


She was with a guy (mid40s) for fourteen years prior to having met me. In the beginning I let her know that I was extremely insecure about their contact, and so she actually went and blocked him from social media. Or so I thought. Because she had actually had him blocked for about two years before I even met her. I thought: “why not just tell me that he was already blocked, instead of saying that he was NOW blocked BECAUSE OF ME. I don’t get it. And, his number was never blocked. She had just deleted him as a contact, but she knows his number, so I guess she just didn’t want to be in a situation where his name would pop up unannounced on her phone while I was there. Made me feel like crap. She kept saying she was over him, didn’t want nothing to do with him and that it was over a long time ago. Didn’t want any contact. So why not just blocking his number? 


Four months in, on my birthday, we were out having some nice dinner. She told me they had been texting for about two weeks, because he had fallen ill. A blood clot. He needed an operation. She went and stayed with him before, during and after. I felt like shit, and I felt like she never really meant what she had said about not wanting nothing to do with him. She basically kept defending him and their relationship. Not much I can do about that, but I again felt like shit. She doesn’t want him in her life, wants nothing to do with him, but she’s going to be there whenever he is in need? I get it, it’s nothing to do with him, heck, I know he didn’t choose to get sick. 


Now, I don’t like the guy. He had basically cheated on her their entire relationship, his bdsm activity with 18year olds and he had ‘borrowed’ tons of money from her. Never paid her back. I’ve never met him, and I don’t need to. Problem is, she goes out of her way to take his side as he is “sick” and that she has forgiven him. 


One day, about two months ago, he texts her. He wanted some therapy bells back that she had at our place. She immediately goes out of her way to bring said bells to his mothers house. That way she could go say hi to her former mother in law, who she sees as her own mother. All he had to do was yell “get them to me” and she did just that, left me at home and drove off. Again, I felt unprioritized. 


One day he had driven past us in town, and he winked at us, which I didn’t see. He then texts her “ hey, did you see the car? 😁?”  She texted back” yeah, nice car”!  He fucking owes her immense amounts of money, and she just comply to his way of conversation in that tone? I felt like, no matter how much he had been fucking her over, he’s still got his way with her. 


She still tells me she wants nothing to do with him, doesn’t want no contact and doesn’t want him in her life. She still keeps his number open though. She still defends their relationship. She still tells me she doesn’t love him or think about him and that he means nothing. But she’ll go out of her way to argue that he was ‘the one that was there for her when her mother died’ and that he was the one that was there for her when she went through depression two years ago, where she was diagnosed with bipolar type 2. 


Now, I can’t seem to make sense of anything she says anymore. I don’t know if I can trust her, because she has a way of actually changing things that she has said, in a way that makes it seem so innocent later on if I bring it up. She’ll actually ‘forget’ what she had texted him, ‘forgetting what had happened those times they were in contact’. Sometimes this makes me feel like I am in the wrong. That’s how this makes me feel. Now, I’m aware of my insecurities, and I know that I am in constant need of reassurance. I just don’t know anymore. I need help here. I have literally no close friends, not much family (I’m from a very broken household). 


My gf has gifted me a bunch of stuff. Some expensive stuff as well. But sometimes she’ll use them as an actual argument as to HOW much she loves me. She uses those things AGAINST ME. My late mother did the exact same thing. 


I haven’t really been in many relationships in my life. And most of them were before I became an actual adult. 


Now were at a place where she knows all my insecurities about the ex and her, and it’s a silly fucking place to be. I’m not much of a man at all right now. I’ll tell her that I have ‘jealous thoughts’ and she knows it’s about them. So she is in complete control. She’ll comfort me, and tell me he doesn’t matter and that he means nothing, wants nothing to do with him yada yada, and I’ll feel a little comfort. At least for like five minutes. 


Other red flags, that are unrelated to the ex: 


- she sees herself as a medium. Talks to spirits and stuff. And her dead mother has ‘come through’ on multiple occasions before we met, and told her about me. At first I laughed it off (nervously haha) but not so much anymore. She seems somewhat disconnected from this world. 


- she is bipolar type 2, as stated earlier. In the beginning there was an instance where we were cuddling in bed, and she told me about how stressed out she was from everything in her life. She had the most MANIC FREAKING SMILE I ever did see. It frightened me. I tried playing it cool, and said something like; well you’ve got to take care of yourself, babe’! The smile dropped for about half a second, but came back even bigger. No emotion in her eyes. It freaked the living shit out of me. On numerous occasions I’ve had a eerie feeling about her state of mind, but nothing too big. 


- she is a science major. She is very inconsistent. She stays home about 40% of the time, doesn’t do the work she needs and she’ll rely almost always on me being there for cuddles and kisses. I’m not a great example myself, since I have no job at the moment (I’m undergoing therapy, and am seeing a doctor who is looking into whether or not I have borderline personality disorder. He is pretty sure that I do. 


Now, I’ve NEVER been taking any responsibility towards bettering my own situation. I’ve always ended up places more of as a result of circumstance than choice. It’s really my own fault. But I’m becoming more aware of my traits as a human, and I know that I need to find comfort in myself and make a living for myself in the long run. I’m starting here, trying to reach out, because I need objective opinions on this. I would really appreciate it if you would leave me a comment, tell me what you think. Whether you think I’m in the wrong or not, please leave me something. Even just words of comfort. Even if you have ever been in anything remotely similar, or are as insecure as me. 


Tl;dr: I’m getting a lot of mixed signals from my gf, especially with regards to her ex and the contact they’re having. She’ll say she doesn’t want him in her life and wants no contact, but she’ll go out of her way to defend him. He had treated her like dirt, and she still seems very strongly about him. I didn’t know what to think. 


Thank you for reading. Thanks for your time.

"(25M) Girl I love (25F) doesn't love me she love someone else no one cares I'm sad she rejected me and set me up with a fat ugly girl it was embarrassing. Can I get advice on attracting hot women so that i don't look like a loser dating a fat girl? Cause that's what will happen if i date a fat girl.


Before I say it again:
 if you're not gonna offer any sympathy then at least offer advice to where i can attract good looking women. Not the fat ugly girls everyone tells me to settle for. 


The girl I'm in love with who's one of my close friends is getting married to someone else I've had feelings for her since I was 14 years old and I'm 25 now everyone else has been happy for her and no one has cared to check to see how I'm doing cuz they know how I feel I've given up on life when it comes to this I don't know whether to commit suicide or to pack a bag buy a plane ticket and run away and tell no one where I went and never come back can I get some advice or sympathy for my problems please. I get no bright side no Silver Linings no happy endings

I hate her fiance he's a fucking little bitch i hate him and i want kick his keebler elf looking hipster punkass he fucking sucks. 


The girl didn't respect me enough to give me an actual reason why i wasn't good enough for her and she chose a dude who i pray gives me a reason to punch him right in the fucking face cause he sucks that much. I wish cancer on that fuck so i can spit on his coffin 

I asked girls on here if he's better looking than me and they all said yes he was and theyd rather date him than me. Can anybody give me advice thats beneficial for me? Not advice that only benefits her boyfriend, cause reality is if you say ""If you really love her youd be happy for her"" or ""move on"", that has no benefits for me it only benefits her bitchboy punkass boyfriend.

I'm 25 never a girlfriend or kissed still a virgin never a date no good looking attractive women like me. Everyone tells me to lower my standards to unattractive obese women and I'm tired of it. I'll feel like even more of a loser if i end up with a woman who isn't hotter than the girl who rejected me after all my rejections and failures with women

Again to recap she doesn't love me she loves him nobody feels bad for me because everybody else wants these two to be married already and the only type of girls who like me or unattractive obese girls so I don't get a bright side or a silver lining or happy ending that benefits me all of those is a losing situation for me or I end up with either nothing or what doesn't make up for what I lost out on. I told her I love her she rejected and then after rejecting me she tried setting me up with a fat ugly girl after thinking she did me a favor when all it really did was insult me. 


**TL;DR**

She's marrying someone else and no attractive women like me so life sucks and only fat ugly girls likes me and everyone expects me to just cave and settle for fat ugly girls after she rejected me and I'm sick of it.

"My [23f] boyfriend [24m of 1.5 years] ‘likes’ hot photos of my friends, what is appropriate internet behavior in a relationship?


My boyMy boyfriend and I have been together for a year and a half now. We met while he was abroad for a semester at my school. Since then, we’ve been traveling to see one another. 

Everything has been pretty great so far. We’ve had incredible adventures all around the world, lived together for the entire summer in a foreign country and literally created lives for ourselves from the ground up. We’ve been through thick and thin and our goal now is to move in together when we graduate in the spring. We’re worrying about visas now but he’s said that he will literally marry me if we can’t get hired in either country. 

We’ve had very serious chats about why we’re doing this and what this relationship means to us as we are both dishing out a ton of money to see one another as often as possible etc.

I’m going to see him next for two weeks after Christmas. 

It’s just that, my trust wavers a bit sometimes. I know that this is normal.. but sometimes I just feel uncertain. 

Unfortunately social media is in our faces constantly. There have been several bouts of him liking other girls photos. You may want to argue that social media isn’t “real” but the fact of the matter is that it is a very real aspect of human social structure and what happens there does have a real affect on human emotion and relationships. 

The odd thing is that it’s always one particular girl that he likes the photos of, at least that I know of. I don’t know about his social media connects from home. 

The first girl was another girl from my school. He only liked photos of her, none of her other stuff, none of her with her boyfriend. Just her. I never mentioned it and it stopped eventually. 

The next girl was one of my outer circle friends. He didn’t know that I knew her until I mentioned that I was with her one day. He continued to like photos of just her. One day I finally brought it up. I asked if he was into her or if something had gone on between them or what. He laughed and said that he was actually happy that I noticed and that I was jealous because that’s an appropriate reaction and means that I care. He said that she had cool photos (ehem she had other cool photos NOT of her) but yeah sure maybe he liked them too much. I dug more and he eventually admitted that they had matched on tinder when he first came to my school (before we met) but he never perused her or something like that. I haven’t seen him like any of her photos since. He also had a point that why on earth would he try to cheat on me with someone at MY school which is on the other side of an ocean from him. Fair.

(To be clear, I’m not digging to find his likes, he’s the Instagram that interact with the most so his like pops up as an icon)

Now one ‘like’ stood out to me today. It was on a close friend of mines photo. He occasionally likes her photos. She’s one of my closest friends, he knows her, she’s in my department, he knows that I literally spend every day and night with her. We’re all friends. He doesn’t typically like her photos often though and hasn’t in a while. Today she posted a particularly hot photo of herself and blam, his like was right there. 

He also really hasn’t talked to me today.. I know that he’s been busy but I think that the lack of attention plus the addition of his slight attention for my friend was a bit..  ugh.

So I my question for you is what are your social media boundaries in your relationship. I think that everyone has a different “like” language . Some people ‘like’ everything. Some people don’t ‘like’ anything. Some people only ‘like’ their friends stuff to be nice. Some people ‘like’ pictures of hot individuals, models, celebrities, porn accounts, and it means nothing. But sometimes specific ‘likes’ just feel like... did you have to do that? Because sometimes it’s like.. letting that person as well as the world know that you think they’re hot, all in front of your partner. It’s basically like going up to someone in a room full of people that your partner is also in, and saying, “I think you’re hot” whether you have intentions or not. Am I over reacting?

—
TLDR: boyfriend likes hot photos of my friends SOMETIMES. It freaks me out a bit as we’re in a long distance relationship and by nature that is based entirely on trust. What is appropriate internet behavior in a relationship? Should I talk to my boyfriend about this or should I just leave it?"

"Should I stay at his house?


I (18F) met this guy (20M) on tinder about 5 weeks ago. We’ve been texting ever since, all day, everyday. So far we’ve been on 5 dates and he’s insisted on paying for everything. Up until this point, we haven’t had sex but other physical contact yet it took him till the 4th date to actually kiss me. I’d say things are going well, considering. I made it a point early on to ask him his intentions and he said that he didn’t want to just hook up and was looking for something serious. 

We haven’t had any type of “serious” relationship talk relating to exclusivity but it’s still pretty early on and I don’t plan to have the conversation for at least another 2 months, if this is still happening. However, he seems very interested. He constantly says he wants to see me and that he wishes I was with him and he’s sad that I have to go back home for about a month for the holidays. He’s even asked if he could come visit me while I’m back home. 

Earlier this week though, I found that he was still on tinder, updating his pictures. I’m obviously not upset, because I can’t be because I have the app and we aren’t in a relationship but it does make me question his interest. 

So, tonight, I was supposed to go over to his house but his extended family ended coming over last minute. He lives with his parents, which I don’t mind because he’s going to school. I obviously didn’t go over but he asked me if I wanted to come stay with him for a couple days next week while his parents are out of town...

While this sounds fun, I’m worried this could negatively impact our relationship but that might be me overthinking it. I also don’t want to get overly attached since this would be an intimate thing. I also understand the implications of staying with him, overnight, for that long. 

Is it too early for this? Should I be wary to say yes to this?
Thanks for any advice. 

Tl;Dr: I’ve (18F) been seeing this guy (20) for about 5 weeks. Been constantly texting and seem to have a good connection. He seems fairly interested and always wants to hang out. Invited me over to his house while his parents are away for 3 days. Should I do this or is it too soon?"
"Husband of six months has genital herpes.


This is a big shock to me. He had a very active sexual life prior to dating me and in March before our marriage he got tested for everything sexual disease and the labs were negative but the dr apparently did not send the blood tests for herpes to the lab on time. I was a virgin when I married him and free of any disease. This is devastating to me and I am not sure how much it will affect our marriage. I am most probably infected as well and tomorrow I
will consult a dr for blood test. 

Has any of you found out after you got married that your partner was infected? What did you do?
I can not even start to wrap my mind around this. 
I have to mention that he is a great husband and 100% has not cheated on me. It must have been from a previous sexual encounter but nonetheless it is very hard for me to grasp. 

TL;DR After a rush husband goes to dr and tells me he has genital herpes. I need advice on how to deal with the news. "

"Am I [F17] being emotionally/physically abused by my ex-boyfriend [M17] ?


I’m currently a senior in high school, and I’m still pretty good friends with my ex-boyfriend. 
So, for some background info: this boy has had the biggest crush on me since our freshman year. It wasn’t until last year (our junior year) that I decided to go out with him. It was AMAZING. He never had a girlfriend before, and my middle school relationships... don’t count, so he was my first for everything. First date, first guy to meet my parents, first time I’ve ever been to a guy’s house, etc. During our relationship, I was extremely happy, and so was he, and everything was fine.

We didn’t see each other over summer break, and he ignored me when school started back up (this year), so, instead of waiting around for him to break up with me, I broke up with him. It was awkward at first, but eventually it was okay because we were such good friends before we dated. He even stayed after school with me for THREE HOURS because I locked my keys in my car and we had to wait for AAA to get there. So basically, everything felt good and okay.

We’ve always been kind of flirty... not like holding hands in the hallway or something... more like joking around in class and making fun of each other. Honestly, every week or so I would go over to his house after school and we’d make our or I’d give him a blowjob just because it was fun. Does that make sense? Like it was nice being so comfortable with someone else and there wasn’t any shame. 

(Okay here’s where the main stuff comes in):

Recently, he’s seemed kind of abusive? We used to give each other light pinches while passing by each other but I stopped and he went harder. Now he’s always either stepping on my feet, squeezing my stomach, giving me those “indian sun burns” or pinching me really hard. Even though it’s not like he’s yelling and punching me, does it still sound like an abusive friendship? He also only talks to me in school now (in the past we would text 24/7) which I’m fine with, but I’m NOT fine with him expecting me to reply ASAP when he texts me and thinking it’s okay to ignore me every time I ask him something (via text) at all. The only time he ever wants me to come over is when he wants head or to makeout or something. He also has been really mean with the comments on my snapchat story lately. It’s always “you’re so late” “who tf” “you’re dumb,” etc. I also tell him to stop touching me and he NEVER listens. He laughs the whole time like it’s a joke.

I asked my friend if she thinks he’s mean to me, and she says he’s just joking around. That’s what he says when I “complain” too. Am I being dramatic, or is this not okay?


tl;dr my ex-boyfriends “jokes” are harming me emotionally and physically but I don’t know if I’m being too dramatic or if it’s a serious issue. It also seems super one-sided. I’m not sure.


PLEASE let me know. I’m so annoyed/conflicted/frustrated/stressed/confused.

"Me and sister in law fell in love


Well this literally started a week ago but four years ago looked at her lost in her glance at mine. I started blushing and so did she crazy thing is she was with my brother. She was pregnant by someone else before she married my brother then she got pregnant by a ex because her family was going to kick her out. And she needed a place to live. Things got bad she started living in a shelter my brother tried to help but ended up breaking her, cheated multiple times lied to her face never helped her with anything. This stuff went on for the four years and I was always against the marriage but I locked my feelings away because I felt it’s what she wanted. Not knowing he would do such a thing every time I was told I died a little inside because I could’ve protected someone I truly loved. Her morals and values is what I fell in love with yeah she’s beautiful but the fact she never cheated even after getting cheated on still nothing she use to cook clean always had food ready for her family the kids and him. I know the story is long but bare with me please. Well a week ago I texted her on Instagram asking her how she and the kids were doing. She said they’re good no complaints and then she told me did your brother tell you we’re getting a legal separation  then after that a divorce. I was like no, before she said even one word I knew he cheated again without hesitation. She told me how she married the wrong person she loves her child with him for-sure but she should’ve married me. Because of the simple fact I was always there without hesitation with whatever she needed. I’m not married and I have two kids also two daughters. So as of recently me and her got intimate and let me tell you for both of us it was nothing we ever felt before. We were super sensitive to our touch I breathed on her she’d jolt if she’d touch my neck I’d get goose bumps. When we hugged naked it felt like our bodies were vibrating and our temperatures boy it like you can fry an egg on us. In my heart of hearts I knew I loved her not because of sex but because I feel what she’s been through when I touch her the pain passes to me and makes me sad. But forward one more day or later on that day she tells me while in her car. She loves me so much and she doesn’t want to do it but how we have to stop what we’re doing because she has two years left in this country. She applied for her citizenship late 3 years late yeah she has a green card but supposedly her citizenship was revoked after it was reviewed. For days I’ve been broken me and her not talking to each other because we’re trying to get rid of the emotions I spoke to her yesterday and all we could do is cry. Then she told me if things were to get better how would we go about the relationship and the kids not be effected by it. Me as a uncle to her kids and her a aunt to mines. She said she wanted to have two kids with me later on if we were to stay together and this is after the time period of two years. Are we wrong to love one another is it or would it be wrong to be together and maybe the kids being confused. I said we can always explain the whole story to them when they get older but she said her kids might hate her and I saw where she was coming from. Next week we’re planning on saying bye to this beautiful thing we have because of deportation scare she has. I told her I’d rather spend it with her the two years but she said if how we feel the way we feel now imagine two years invested she would literally die inside because she would be back in her country and she’d be leaving me behind. Idk what to do nor does she it breaks my heart into pieces to feel something like this for the first time and it’s just taken away tbh she’s being the logically thinking one. But I can’t help the way I feel so you understand. Please help I’m very desperate."
"My(20f) boyfriend(20m) lied for 6 years


I've been with my boyfriend for around 6 years. I know we're young and immature, but I love him to death, even in spite of what happened. We live together. We were engaged until two days ago when I found out he was lying to me. I always had this suspicion because his responses to my questions didn't make any sense.

We had an incident around the first few months of dating. We were like 15. A girl who he liked before me liked him back, but she never wanted to be his girlfriend because she liked a different guy more. He started dating another girl. She didn't seem jealous. Then he started dating me and she all the sudden wanted to be with him. I fell asleep and he couldn't, and he needed to talk to someone. He called her on the phone to complain about me, she offered to have phone sex to make him feel better. He claims he said no and hung up on her. The next morning he told me about it and said he was sorry for calling her in the first place, and that he would block her.

A few days after that, or maybe it was the next day, she sent him nudes. He claims then he told her that was a shitty thing to do and she apologized. He told me she sent him nudes and I was confused because he said he blocked her. I assumed he just forgot. He said she was out of his life. I believed him.

Well it turns out they still would chat on Facebook, he said just small talk. He also didn't take her off of any other social media apps. He always claimed to hate her. He says he kept talking to her just to see what she was up to in her life to see if she was doing worse off than he was. She stayed with the other guy. 

He deleted Facebook when we were 16 but almost 17. He says this is when he really stopped talking to her. Then comes this year, he made a Snapchat. He showed me one day something on it, and I saw her on his friends list. I asked why she was on there. He got really upset and cried saying he wasn't cheating. He smashed his phone saying it was to prove he wasn't talking to her. He said the quick add feature added her to his phone without him knowing, and he just forgot to delete her but he never spoke to her. This was a lie. He added her specifically to talk to her to find out how she was doing in life. He said he was fake nice to her to get information, he told her he was happily engaged to the same girl. She has two kids with the same guy but they aren't married. He says he told her he hopes she's miserable and to fuck off. He said he needed closure. This was in the summer time when he Snapped her. Only the other day I got him to admit he never really cut contact with her.

I wanted to believe his stupid lies. I loved him. I snooped through his phone and found evidence of the old Facebook messages, he denied that he ever had contact with her. Even with the hard evidence in his emails. She was telling him she loved him and sorry they couldn't hang out one day. I also was able to get into his Snapchat that he swore he couldn't get back into because he couldn't remember the log in info. It said she received his message 35 weeks ago. I woke him up asking why it said that. He said ""I don't know, I never talked to that person I swear."" I started yelling saying ""IT SAYS RIGHT HERE, THE PROOF IS RIGHT HERE"" Then he admitted he messaged her. He trickle truthed me until the next day when I told him he needs to come clean with me. I asked about other girls I found too. He said he never cheated or intended to cheat and it was all a mistake. He said he never hung out with her or called her to talk ever again. He said he never told me because he was scared of losing me. 

The guy I was with for 6 years didn't talk to her ever again. He hardly spoke to any other girls.  My boyfriend of 6 years never lied to me. I feel like my whole life was a lie. I feel like I lost a boyfriend I never had. I feel like how Morty must have felt when he moved into a different universe and had to kill the Morty from that universe. He must have felt mind fucked while living with a family that was his and almost the same as his real family, but they weren't his real family. I'm hurting so bad. We were engaged. I had this idea of who he was up until this point, and it turns out that I was wrong. He says he's done lying. He says he never actually cheated. He says he wants to become a real man for me. I want to salvage the relationship but I'm in so much pain. I know people are going to be fast to tell me we're just too immature and should move on. We both don't want to move on. We want to fix this (he says he does anyway). I don't know what to do. Or how to trust someone who looked me in the eyes and told me he wasn't lying, that this was all just unfortunate coincidences, and that he loves me and would never cheat or lie. I'm so heart broken.

**tl;dr** My boyfriend of 6 years (was my fiancé) lied to me for 6 whole years about another girl/other girls. I feel like my reality is forever changed. I miss my old life with him."
"[21F] haven't gone out of the apartment ever since I got married


Throwaway because my husband knows my reddit.

We met during university. I was starting my junior year and he was about to graduate ( we are both Canadians ). He had a job lined up in the US, so I worked my ass off to get a summer internship in the same place. Now that summer has ended, in order to stay together, we got married in September so we would both get a green card in about a year.

I tried taking some online classes at my Canadian university, but they do not offer anything online in my field ( I am in software engineering ). I have looked into transferring to a US university but I can't afford it at all. However, money is not a problem for living since my husband has a good paying job and he does not mind paying for food and rent.

However, I find myself getting lazier and lazier since I don't really have any responsibilities anymore, and due to Visa problem, I cannot work until I get a green card. I have just been working on a couple of side projects, but now realized I almost never stepped out of the apartment since September...

I am just so lost and unsure of what to do. I love him to death, but I am just so bored and unmotivated all the time. I know no one in this place and have not been actively trying to meet new friends - my husband is very introverted and loves staying at home. I feel more and more depressed day by day. How do you even stay motivated when you don't have any responsibilities and anything to look ""forwards"" to? I can't even find the motivation to go out for a walk...

I guess my question would be what would you do in my shoe? Keep trying to learn online? Freelancing? Try to meet new people? (I have some interests including entrepreneurship and hiking, but am unsure where to find like-minded people.)

"I (23F) feel like I stop my boyfriend (21M) having fun but he says I'm not


So the situation is that me and my boyfriend live with our two housemates (23M and 24M). Before my boyfriend got with me, he'd been through a breakup and was in his spending all his money on alcohol and drugs and not giving a shit stage. This meant that he and the other two were all single and their life revolved around getting drunk and not having a care in the world. We then got together and he doesn't go out as often. 

&amp;#x200B;

From an outsiders perspective, it looks like my fun loving boyfriend who loved getting absolutely battered and being careless and always had stories to tell got into a relationship with me and now never leaves his room. However, he has since changed jobs and is working 6 days a week (normally the weekend mornings too) and as he has a driving job they do random drug/alcohol tests and if he was found under the influence from the night before he'd lose his job instantly. We're both dead set on saving money for a mortgage so having this new well paid job is important to him and whilst he could ask for weekends off, he normally offers to work them (meaning he can't go out).

&amp;#x200B;

Aside from his job preventing him going out and his focus on saving money, I also feel like it's natural progression in a sense when you're in a relationship to settle down and be a bit less 'wild' as your priorities change. My struggle though is that I can't help feel I'm holding him back from going out and getting drunk and having fun. It doesn't help that the two guys we live with are forever telling me that he was more fun before me and that he doesn't go out because of me. My boyfriend tells me to ignore them but I hate that everyone has this perception of me.

&amp;#x200B;

We do still go out sometimes but only about once a month when he used to be in the pub every night. He reassures me that even if he does sometimes crave a night out, he knows his way of life now is better for him as he is healthier and it allows him to focus on work and save money etc. I asked him yesterday if he wanted to go out and again today because I'm worried it's me holding him back but both times he's said no because of work and money. He then pointed out that it had been a long time since we last went out (maybe 4 weeks?) I said ""I bet you're gagging for a night out"" and his reaction showed me he was. 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm just worried that I'm doing something wrong I guess?

"Forced relationship advice?

"Should I [28F] break up with my BF [28M] of nearly 4 years?


Reasons why I'm considering breaking up:

* We're 3 months into an anticipated 3 years of long distance and I don't know if I'll be able to do it. We will be able to see each other every 3/4 weeks but it involves a short plane journey usually costing around $50. Because of reasons, I haven't been able to see him in nearly 2 months and its been really hard. 
* A lot people are very critical about the long distance thing and honestly I'm sometimes embarrassed to tell people about it because deep down I know its ridiculous to try make 3 years long distance work. 
* We've never lived together properly and I'm worried in 3 years time once we do get to live together, we could realise it doesn't work. I don't exactly have a lot of time to settle down compared to him. I would like for kids to be an option for me and don't want to be 31 starting over. 
* I moved for a job. I might have stayed for him but it meant not pursuing my career. He never asked me not to take the job. 
* When we first got together he convinced me to stay in his country saying we could eventually move in together. After a year, I thought we might but it turned out he had no intention of moving out of his parents until he had the exact job he wanted and until he could afford to buy a house. He wouldn't consider renting so I had to live with strangers the entire time. I even moved back to my country then moved back to his for a while and even then he wouldn't consider renting with me for that time. I understand it made the most financial sense for him to do that but I don't think it was fair of him to hint that he would move in with me in the future. He has hinted at marriage before but now I don't know if I trust anything he says about future plans. 
* We've come close to breaking up before. Sometimes we just can't agree on something. We're both very stubborn and like things done a certain way. It feels like we always do things how he wants e.g. we always eat what he wants to, we watch his movies etc. We bicker a lot. There have been times where days out have nearly been ruined because of fighting. 
* There's been two times where he's properly scared me. Once we were fighting while we were driving and he starting speeding and laughing and it freaked me out. Another time, a few months ago, we'd been out with some friends drinking and we got into a fight when we came home. He switched into this person I've never seen before and haven't seen since. He starting calling me horrible names (cunt, bitch, dog) and said the only reason he doesn't break up with me is because I'll kill myself. He's called me names before in arguments even though I've had a conversation specifically with him about this. 
* He's really busy with work at the moment but is working from home sometimes so he can take breaks to call me but doesn't. He's fine with going 2 days without speaking (including texting). He also cuts conversations before I feel like we're done so he can watch a movie as a break. For me, I take a break from work by talking to him but talking to me isn't a break for him. 
* I get the impression that my family don't really like him and some of my friends don't.
* He always jokingly makes fun of me but he does it about things he knows I'm sensitive about and it can be wearing sometimes. 
* Politically, we are very different. Also his family have political views that I 100% disagree with and don't want to be associated with. 
* He criticises my clothes a lot and my cooking. 
* Everytime I have a problem with a friend or at work, he always finds a way to blame me. I can sometimes get a bit too worried about things but he always finds a way to blame me about a situation and surely I can't be wrong all the time. This probably has been a source of stress for the relationship (me getting anxious about things and wanting to talk about them) but I have been better at not bringing home my day from work.  

I'm currently meeting a lot of new people because of my job but this wont be the case in a few months. I don't want the reason I break up with him to be because I'm meeting new people and consequently considering what else is out there. I'll be working by myself a lot more in a few months and don't want to regret breaking up with him and realise my judgement was clouded by the situation I was in. 

&amp;#x200B;

Sometimes it's great with him and we're so in sync. We laugh a lot. I like how driven he is. I've experienced a lot with him and do want to experience more. We've talked about how great it would be to live together and vaguely talked about marriage. He seems keen to keep up with the long distance thing but to be honest, in the last few months we were together, we had some big fights and had trouble with sex, which was new for us. Despite the different political views, I do really like his family and they have been really good to me. His family seem to think we can make it work. Although sometimes I get the feeling they would prefer someone who from the same country as him but I don't know that for sure. 

&amp;#x200B;

I've been having quite bad social anxiety in the last few years (something I haven't experienced this badly before and don't have any explanation as to why it's gotten this bad). Part of me is scared I'll become anxious on dates (which isn't something I had before) and am worried this will stop me from meeting someone. I've become increasingly shy and it has prevented me from making new friends.  

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR: I'm considering breaking up with my BF of nearly 4 years, partly because we will be long distance for the next 3 years but partly because of how our relationship was before we became long distance (we're 3 months into the long distance and were in the same place most of the time before that). We're not talking as much as I'd like to and I'm finding the distance tough. We were fighting a lot before I moved. I don't agree with his political views. However, I'm meeting lots of new people at my new job but will be transferred somewhere soon where I will be working much more independently. My judgement might be clouded because of my current work situation and I don't want to regret breaking up with him later on when I'm back to a normal working day. "
"It will never be the same


It started with one message and developed into something genuine, warm and absolutely addictive. 
Every moment was seized. Eight hours time difference and ocean distance were not a hindrance to our desire to spend time together. Hear his voice. His laughter. Exchange jokes. Express affection. We saw things the same way. 
This type of connection is rare. You value it. You work for it. You are devoted. And then he betrays you. 
He used dating app. The same he found you on. He was chatting to other girls. Just like he did it with you.
He flirted. He felt good about himself. He got advice from Reddit what pick up line to choose. He got her number. 
It hurts. You’ve been always loyal. You felt uncomfortable even when someone else tried to talk to you. He was enough and more. 
He is sorry. He believes it can be fixed. He asks to give him another chance. But it will never be the same. He is just a stranger. Such a close, dear and special stranger. "
"Anyone working, or have a partner working in psychiatric care?


Hi!
I'm living with my SO of 7 years and we're expecting our first child in spring next year. My SO works in an acute psychiatric care unit at the local hospital, where very sick patients are hospitalized. He, my SO, mostly work night-time, and he tries to take on extra shifts to make extra money and fill up his work month due to not having a full-time job there.

During periods where he works alot and has very little time off, we barely see each other, he's very tired, and his temper and patience is not so good. 
The last few weeks he's been working a lot again, almost no days off, and when does have a day off, he's so tired and he sleeps when I'm awake and we have maybe seen each other 30 min a day.

I'm pregnant and a bit more emotional than normal, but nothing crazy, I can cry a bit easier than normal, but other than that I feel like normal. I also have very little energy and I have trouble sleeping, making a baby takes up a lot of energy for some reason! I just started working half days after being on full sick leave for a while, I finally have enough energy to work a little. 

Lately I have found myself missing my SO due to him working so, so much, and we have had zero quality time to fill up on positive input in our relationship. Plus, my SO have much frustration due to his workplace, so he has a big need to talk about work. I listen, we discuss, and i try my best to support him. I work in a rehabilitation unit and I've met my fair share of difficulties in the work place. I'm a trained health professional, physiotherapist, and can relate to many things in his work place. How ever I would never work in an acute psychiatric unit, because I find it too stressful and potentially dangerous at times. And naturally I worry about my SO when I know it's extra stressful at his job. 

So, the other night, he took the night off from work, he went to a colleague because he needed to vent about work and didn't want to keep venting to me. I was a bit disappointed that he chose to take his one night off to spend it away from home, but that was what he needed and he promised to come home in time for us to hang out an hour or so before I had to go to sleep. And also make dinner and hang the next day when I got off work. 
It turned out that some other colleague showed up and he didn't come home in time for us to hang out. I found myself very disappointed and sad, because I thought he understood my feelings around him working so much lately and I felt like I was gonna miss out once again.

Just to be clear, I want him to hang out with other people, and I realize we all need to hang out with friends, on a regular basis, I do more often than my SO. Also I'm not asking for much, just want to see him for a bit more than 30 min a day and maybe then doing something else than talking about work and having a swift dinner before he has to rush off to work again.

Well, we got into a fight, I felt like he was just defending himself amd showing no understanding of my feelings. He says he feels like he cannot leave the house without me getting upset etc. The classic controlling girlfriend BS imo. I do not relate to that at all and my point of view is that his work situation also takes a toll on me and  our relationship, not just him. He didn't seem to be able to wrap his mind around that the last few weeks has been hard on me as well, and that I feel lonely, we never go to bed together, he mostly falls asleep on the couch and he's nocturnal and I have a day job.
He got very angry, said he did not feel guilty at all for not being able to come home, and he felt like I was being demanding and not giving him any slack.
I admitted that it was hard to give him slack because I got disappointed and sad, but that would have wanted to if I hadn't been feeling the way have about the last few weeks. We sort of worked things out and became friends again. 

But he told that he got very irritated with be when we texted before he got home that night, and he told his colleague about the situation and that he felt like he could never leave the house to hang out with other people because I would turn it into some issue. His colleague is also a friend of mine, but they are obviously better friends than me and my SOs colleague. The colleague of course took sides with my SO and supported my SO and agreed that I was being needy and that it seemed like my SO couldn't hang out with other people than me, without me being pissed off in some way.

Sooo.. I now feel very misunderstood by my SO, but also his colleague, and I feel like explaining myself and it really bothers me. My issue was and is NOT that he hang out with other people than me, but that we as a couple have had so little time together lately that it has made me sad and lonely to the point where I got very disappointed when our plans the other night fell through because my SO didn't come home in time.

Is there anyone here that has some input for me on my wall of text? Maybe someone with similar experience? Many thanks!

Tl:dr: need advice on explaining and understanding that having a partner working night-time in a psychiatric care unit, while pregnant can take its tall on me and our relationship. "

"My dad (42m) is mad at me (18m) for not wanting a present I specifically said don’t get me


So my family is going to be in Jamaica for Christmas so we decided to do Christmas this morning. The tickets and travel expenses were pretty expensive for all our family and my birthday is very close to Christmas. My parents wanted to make it clear that Jamaica was the main Christmas gift but we would still have stuff to open. Now I asked for some new dirtbike gear which is fairly expensive for my birthday and that’s the bulk of what I wanted, but i asked asked for some very small stuff for Christmas cause I didn’t know what I wanted. My parents asked if I wanted an iPad for Christmas and I told them no because they’re very expensive and I didn’t think I’d use it much cause I have my phone. Fast forward to this morning and I get some great presents, I got a nice calendar, game of thrones dvd’s and some very nice slippers! But I also got an iPad... and it’s not that I’m not appreciative of getting it but I told them specifically I didn’t want one because I know my birthday gifts and our trip to Jamaica cost a lot. My dad accused me of being rude and ungrateful for seeing if they could return and spend the money on our trip. My dad and me got into a little bit of a fight over it. Am I wrong for feeling this way?

TLDR: father (42m) got me an expensive Christmas present I (18m) specifically told them not to get for me"
"My (21F) girlfriend hasn’t texted me (25m) or call recently.


So this girl and I have been dating LDR for nearly 3 months now. Just this Tuesday we went out to a concert together and had a great time but since I got home I have barely heard a word out of her. 

She’s sent me snaps to keep up streaks and that’s it. 

And I know she’s had finals Thursday and Friday morning, so I wasn’t expecting much, but today she was in NYC all day and I’m just sitting here like do I not warrant any thought at all? Not a quick text, or a phone call, or anything. And like, I don’t know if she’s texting anyone else or not but I just find it hard to believe she hasn’t used her phone all day. 

I just want to hear from her or know what’s going on, but I’m scared that something bass happening. I haven’t texted her because this happens sometimes, and I want to see if she will just text me... starting to worry she won’t. 

Struggling to sleep right now because of it and I’m just wondering, should I text her? Should I ask what’s up? I’m just kind of at a loss here, it’s been three days since I’ve had really any communication with my girlfriend. Am I an ass for playing this game, which I hate? Just tired of making the first move all the time I guess. 

TL;DR - Gf doesn’t text me for days, wondering if something is wrong/relationship in danger, what do I do "

"I (25M) can’t figure this girl (26F) out after the first date


I met this girl through a dating app. We chatted for a couple days, mostly small talk. I noticed she was a little short in her texts, not rude, just..brief. I really didn’t think anything of it. I then asked her out for drinks and she said yes.

Our date was last night. We met at a popular bar in her neighborhood. The conversation flowed naturally and I felt we were off to a good start. We then migrated to another bar. Same thing: good conversation, positive body language, and full engagement. She didn’t look at her phone once the entire date. At this bar, we both started getting a little tipsy and kissed several times. 

We decided to check out one more bar. We talked more, shot some pool, while periodically exchanging kisses. At this point, the date was going stellar from my perspective. The night ended with her sitting in my lap and us making out at this bar. Lots of affection, etc. Unfortunately, she had to work in the morning, so we parted ways after about a five hour date.

Fast forward to this afternoon (I slept late). I text her and tell her I had a great time and she made me very happy. She texts back “aw good :) I had a great time too”. I ask if she wants to hang again soon and she says for sure. We texted a little more and it turns out she has a huge knack for used bookstores, as do I. So I took the plunge and asked her out on a second date tomorrow for lunch and book shopping. She replies that she’d love to but has plans with friends. No problem, we’ll make it happen soon enough. And that was the end of the conversation.

Here’s the thing: if a girl really wants to pursue you, wouldn’t she normally counter with a different day/time if she already had plans? I just got a disinterested tone from her reply when I asked her out again. Yeah, I know we were all over each other last night. But maybe that was just the alcohol for her? Am I reading into this way too much?

TLDR: Sparks flew on the first date, but now I’m questioning if she’s actually interested"
"My (19M) girlfriend (19F) of 2 1/2 yrs ended things - struggling to move on


I have been finding it really hard to move on. I don't even remember the exact moment she ended things, I believe it took a week for me to have it confirmed by her. We have been meeting somewhat often (2-3 times a week) and in that time she has been telling me about a new guy she has slowly been getting closer too. However, she has simultaneously given me reasons for hope - such as saying she just needs to work out what she thinks or that if we are meant to be together it will work out, and we have napped together a few times. I must admit, I wasn't great to her. I had just started uni and was trying to make friends so couldn't meet with her as often as she wanted (basically every day). This resulted in an argument, and me not seeing her for a week. It was from then that the issues started. 

I have just been finding it so hard to move on, and now she has finally said the meetings need to stop as it keeps hurting her and that 'this should be the end'. I want to be able to respect her opinion but for now I find it really really hard. Especially as I realised my mistakes and have been trying hard to show her this. 

I don't want to lose her in my life forever, but I know it is wrong for me to hope that if I wait long enough eventually I will be with her again. With the holidays approaching, I am scared about not messaging her and being unable to meet her as she will drift further, yet at the same time maybe if I keep contacting her I will push her away further and it will result in her hating me. 

Sorry, I have just been really struggling and want some help. Simply put, she has been able to move on easily and despite her asking me to do so I seem unable to right now and I am trying to limit the hurt I cause to her and myself as a result.

"I (27M) compare myself to my romantic partners. How do I stop?


As a single person, I'm pretty confident about myself - I think about my strengths, accomplishments, and individuality. I like to date people who are ambitious and want to be successful. 

The problem is, when I get into a relationship, I can't help but play the comparison game and then all my self-confidence goes to shreds. For example, I'm introverted and prefer extroverted partners. But usually my extroverted friends/partners are also very good at creating connections and maintaining networks, and I consider myself bad at these things. Or I want a partner near my line of work but then the kind of success one of us would achieve may be higher than the other. Then there are differences in attractiveness, athleticism, and so on. I get envious or resentful of how good they have it and fail to keep the perspective I have as single me. The constant barrage ruins my happiness, work, life, and eventually my romantic relationships.

I just see this as an intractable problem of feeling like I'm in someone else's shadow unless I'm all-around better. I want a partner that is amazing and checks all the boxes, but as things stand eventually it would make me feel less-than just because of who they are and what they've done. 

Am I just incompatible with having an amazing partner? What work do I do to overcome this lest I lose the chance of a loving, long-lasting relationship in life?

tl;dr I date people who are both similar and opposite to me but get insecure and envious from comparing what they are good at (and I am bad/worse at). What do I do to keep my self-confidence in these relationships?"

"I [21F] am treated differently by my dad, stepmom, and grandmother than the rest of the kids/grandkids.


I’ve always been treated differently than any of my cousins. I was always given less than they were. I have always had  good morals and good  grades and have almost always been employed. I’m not sure why I’m not treated the same...  I always am the one taking care of the grandparents, aunts and uncles... watching their dogs etc. but for some reason I am not given to nearly as much as they are by my dad, grandparents, or stepmom. I don’t get the respect they get... I don’t get my rent paid for or my car paid for... I’m proud of this, but at the same time bitter as hell. My parents are the only ones to be divorced out of my cousins parents and my mom died 2 years ago... but still I am always held to higher standards than they are. I can always do better but they do mediocre and that’s good. They drop out of college and that’s good. I don’t get it. I’m just hurt.

TL/DR I’m treated more harshly than my cousins are even though my life has been more difficult. "
"A good friend or a secret crush?


To start off me \[M16\] and her \[F16\] have been friends for like a year now. (lets call her Elise)Just recently she has been acting differently, to start off 3 or 4 times shes she´s texted me during class that she´s bored and we´d both ask to go to the bathroom and just hang out for a while. Also, I was hanging out with 2 of my friends at lunch (who are girls). And Elise, upon seeing us, joins us and starts being kinda rude by telling them they shouldn´t be my friends. Also, she claims she´s dating someone but who goes to our school but i´ve NEVER seen him.(kinda suspicious)

&amp;#x200B;

Also, we all planned to go outside but last second I was like nah i´m aight I don wanna go(i wanted to hang with those two girls instead) and Elise was like nope. your coming 100%. Also, she picks on me a little bit like oh ha ur so small the freshmen are almost your size. I´m 5´ 9¨. Also, at lunch she texts me ¨ur at the usual spot right¨ cause I usually hang and play cards with my friends and i´m like yeah and then she shows up and plays with us. Also, every day after school I hang out with some friends (different people than I hang with at lunch)  and she usually is like ¨U coming after school today¨ and then comes and joins us. 

&amp;#x200B;

Now i´m wondering if Elise likes me and if the reason she was a jerk when I was hanging with those two girls was because she´s jealous. How do I deal with this cause even though she´s attractive I don´t want to date her (don´t ask why in the comments it´s complicated).

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR:

friend of over a year might like me not sure if she does."

"Compromising too much?


So lately I’ve been venting to a friend about my (24F) relationship with my boyfriend (23M). We’ve been together about 5 years in total (with a one year break at year three) 

We have children together. We want to make our relationship work. We both know that we have some issues to work on and we both have discovered that we have completely different love languages (thanks Reddit) 

That being said we have looked in to ways to help, but unfortunately we cannot afford professional help. 

Anyways! I was telling my friend that if things don’t work out I doubt I’ll ever be with someone else.  (not trying to sound bitter, I just don’t like the idea much) I also mentioned that one of the reasons for this is because i want to live my life without having to compromise or discuss it with other people. 

She asked me to explain. 
I explained how he wants to live in a small town on tons of land, and I want to live in the city area (not city city, but definitely not small town) 
He wants to leave the state we reside, I do not. 
He wants another kid. I don’t. 
I explained that I want to be with him, but I was so tired of giving up things that I wanted, or making him give up things that he wanted. 

When do you know that it’s time to end a relationship? When do compromises become giving up dreams? 

TLDR: We compromise a lot, on big and little things. Can we make it through this? "

"My (22F) boyfriend (22M) of 5 years needs some time apart to work on himself, and I need advice


\*\*Very long post\*\*

I don't usually post but I really need some help as I am deeply heartbroken. My boyfriend and I love each other very much, but something has always been in the way of our relationship. He has a lot of personal issues that have been gnawing at him through the years and that make him miserable, and as a result, they make our relationship harder than it needs to be.

Mainly, he has self-esteem issues. He does not love himself and he is not well in his body. He has been overweight for a while and it always brings him down because he doesn't believe he is attractive and sometimes feels worthless because of his physical appearance. I have always tried to show him how attracted I am to him and how much I love him despite him thinking he isn't worth it, but most of the time he feels like I am weird/wrong for feeling this way about him or thinks he doesn't deserve someone feeling like this about him since he doesn't believe he is worthy of that himself. Sometimes when I compliment him or call him ""handsome"" he even feels bad (maybe he thinks it comes out as fake but I really do believe he is handsome). He has always felt like an outcast and socially awkward as well, although when we go out at events many people come to say hi to him and talk to him. Some even see him as a model to follow since he is so invested in his projects (he is in the music industry). Although a bunch of people look up to him or are excited to see him, he feels like he doesn't belong to any particular group, and I don't believe he has very close friends that he feels comfortable to confide in about these personal issues. He also has a lot of trouble being in touch with his emotions, he finds it very hard to pinpoint why he feels a certain way or what caused it in the first place, and it results in impulsive outbursts. He is the sweetest and kindest person I have ever met, but he is not very in touch with himself and his emotions all the time, and this has caused problems in our relationship as it can greatly impact communication and problem-solving.

He is also always busy, and I don't think he takes nearly enough time to work on himself (I think for a long time he was even avoiding dealing with his stuff by being constantly occupied). He says he wants to stop smoking (pot) and he wants to eat better and exercise and read more, but he never seems to find a way to break bad habits and working on his health. He spends a lot of his time in his passion (music) but in some ways it is hurting him. I told him that it is normal that he doesn't feel at his best because as soon as the music stuff doesn't go right one day (not that it fails completely, but that something happens and puts him down about it) he feels like his whole world breaks down. He agreed that it was best for him to also have other hobbies or activities that give him a sense of accomplishment so he has other stuff to fall back on when he isn't feeling well. We have taken a few breaks in the past 6 months so he could focus on himself but as soon as he felt better, we made up and our relationship got better (more communication, etc.), but he did not keep up the good habits and the cycle starts again.

Another thing that makes him feel lost is the fact that he lives with his parents and they are very controlling. We also feel like we have no privacy (we both live at our parents houses), and we live far from each other (nearly 2h of public transport and no car) and we see each other once a week. When we do, it feels forced because obviously we can't just see each other for only a couple of hours but all weekend seems too much when we have other stuff to do. I can't find the right balance without feeling like I spent all my day in public transport (taxis become expensive at some point), or that I spend too much time with him while I need to do other stuff as well. We also want some intimacy so spending the day meeting half way is not great most of the time.

He was also had a very traumatizing experience when he was a child, and he has never been in a relationship (sexual and/or loving) with anyone else than me, as we started dating at 17. These factors + the self-esteem issues result in him being confused about his sexuality. He has tried to go to therapy about this but his trouble expressing himself has not helped communicating with the therapist, and he ended up dropping out of therapy. He feels like he can't express his sexuality/feels trapped and I feel the same way, as it is hard to be passionate when other people are around and might come in the room any minute or ask for something (his parents are retired and very ""involved"" in his life, so they always need him for something or are always checking up on him even though it drives him insane, and he has told them). I don't feel like we have a lot of privacy even though we really want to.

Last thing, I know he has been suffering for a long time because he does not love himself. I have always been there for him, even though it has been very hard and draining for me because of the problems communicating and with his emotions. I love him with all my heart and I know he feels the same way, but I don't think he has ever been at his best in this relationship since he has so much on his mind all the time so it's hard for him to be with me. I am not high maintenance at all, but sometimes I need a shoulder to cry on and some love when I am down, and sometimes that is too much for him because he has no love for himself, so he doesn't feel like he has the energy to love someone else, as much as he loves me. We are so close, we are practically best friends and we can tell each other everything. He is such a sweet and understanding person, but sometimes I feel that he is different when he has personal issues to deal with at the moment, he becomes distant and doesn't feel like he is able to empathize with people (his words, and not just with me). He cannot comfort me sometimes when I need him (even hug me or kiss me) as he is also constantly in his own pain. Although it is not my responsibility to make him better and take care of him, I feel that the burden falls on me. When we genuinely talk about his issues, he feels better and becomes very open minded and is glad that I am there for him. But he cannot always be there for him when I need him, and it pains me so much. When he ""sobers up"", he realizes that he had to be there for me and couldn't, and it makes him sad and guilty for not always being able to give me what I need.

Two nights ago, I needed him and he couldn't be there for me, and the latter happened. He said that he truly needed some time to work on his issues (that we spent 6h talking about prior to this decision), and we both cried a lot and agreed that it was the best thing to do. We love each other so much, it really pains us to be apart but we know it's the best thing to do. I am just afraid that he will fall back into the same cycle of being busy and not dealing with his stuff. Being apart from the person I love the most is extremely painful for me, especially knowing that he is not well. I constantly break down crying and wondering if he is ok, and wanting to help him and reassure him. I don't know what to do during this time and how long to wait... He called me last night (the same day we said we would spend time apart), he was sobbing and wondering if he made a mistake by asking for a break because he loves me and does not want to lose me. I told him that it is not a mistake and that he needs this time to work on himself, and to keep up good habits (not only forming them) because working on yourself is a life long process. He said that in order to be together he needed to love himself too, and I agreed. I want the best for him, but I am in so much pain. I miss him. I want to hug him and tell him how much I love him. I told him that I would be there when he needs to talk, and that I am always there for him. I just don't know what to do with my own pain while I wait for him to work on his. We said we would keep in touch, but I don't even know how much I should talk to him as I know that he needs to be in his own head space.

I would really appreciate some advice, or just some empathy. Thank you.

TLDR: My bf of 5 years doesn't love himself, and needs some time to work on himself before considering coming back to the relationship. We love each other very much, but being apart from him knowing that he is in pain breaks my heart. I need some advice."
