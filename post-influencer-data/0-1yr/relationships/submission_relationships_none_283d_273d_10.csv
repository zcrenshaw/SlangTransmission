"Worried that I am going to be lonely and won’t have any friends [F20]


Not sure if this is the best subreddit to post this in but I’ll give it a go.

I [F20] have recently graduated and have a job lined up where I will be working for two older adults (basically people who are old enough to be my parents and who I would never spend time with out of work). There will be nobody else in our workplace.

I don’t keep in contact with anyone from high school because we all went our seperate ways and were never really a close friends group. All my friends I made from college (who were great) are moving out of our city for their jobs and I’m so worried I won’t have ANYONE anymore. 

I am quite a shy person and love the idea of having a close group of forever friends, but feel like I’ve never had that. I’m scared I will end up spending my days working, and my weekends at home alone and the thought of it upsets me. I don’t know how I can make friends (I can’t exactly ask clients who come in if they would like to hang out as that is just not okay) or how to even expose myself to meeting new people. Any advice would be appreciated. 

tl;dr: I am scared that once I start working and my only friends move out of the city for work, I won’t have any friends and won’t have opportunities to meet new people."
"[F23] Do I have the right to be upset with my mum [52] over this?


For context I live in the UK; I have mental health issues so can only work part time, luckily I was referred to a occupational therapist about 2 years ago who helped my apply for benefits and working tax credits. Even with those though, I still only make £8000 a year.   
My mother also has mental health issues, arguably worse than mine as she often can’t leave her house. She was on benefits for a long time but when the system changed, she reapplied and was denied which caused her to become so depressed she did not leave her bed for 3 months. When she was finally better, the time to appeal the decision was too late and she would have to wait 6 months to apply again. That was nearly 3 years and she hasn’t reapplied. She says it’s too stressful and having gone through the application process myself (most stressful year of my entire life) I understand but she’s been told by multiple people including people from the job centre that she *needs* the money and should reapply. She still gets job seekers allowance but it almost exclusively goes to her rent and, even though they’re separated, my dad gives her money weekly to pay for her gas and electric and sometimes food. I also give her money when I’m able for food and for petrol (she’ll only leave the house in the car and even then will only to go places she’s familiar with).   
This leads me to our falling out. I recently spent 4 days housesitting for a family friend(FF). Since their house is closer to my mums than mine, I arranged for her to pick me up (from my place) and drop me off(at FFs place) and then pick me up and take me home after I was done housesitting. The FF had left me £50 as a thank you and so I offered my mum £30 of the £50 for petrol for driving me back and forth. A couple of days later my mum tells me she gave the entire £30 to her friend so she could have a meal with her fiancée before a gig they were going to and I honestly couldn’t believe it. My mums friend makes more money than I do (works full time, £10+ph), she also lives with her fiancée who works part time and is on benefits in a council house (the council do not know she’s living there). The same friend also knows my mum is skint and often makes her food when my mum is there (literally just makes extra dinner for her despite my mum being uncomfortable about it). So I honestly cannot fathom why she accepted the money or why my mum offered it to her in the first place. Anyway when my mum told me she’d given the money away, I was visibly upset and she said “oh I guess you don’t want to speak to me now” and I said no. Later she apologised by just saying “I’m sorry” but I know she didn’t really mean it as she told my sister later on that she “doesn’t understand why I’m mad.” It’s been over a week since I’ve spoken to her but I honestly don’t want to. I *never* hold grudges against people and I’m genuinely not an angry person but it really upsets me when I think about what she did. Everyone I’ve spoken to about this has agreed that I am right to be upset but I’m starting to doubt myself as I’ve never gone more than 2 days without speaking or seeing my mum. So do I have the right to be upset here and should I be the one to make the first step in fixing this or should I wait for my mum to offer a genuine apology?   
Thanks for reading, I hope this makes sense and I know some people don’t like to talk about money but I felt like I needed to stress just how much my family doe not have and why this upset so much. 

TL;DR mum gave away money I gave her, for necessities, to her friend and I’m not sure if I’m overreacting or right to be upset"
"I [39/m] married [37/f] loveless, almost sexless marriage driving me crazy


I  have been with my wife for almost 15 years, married 11 of those and  have two children 8 and 5.  My wife has always been difficult when it  comes to being intimate, I have tried everything to get her to loosen up  and enjoy herself but to no end.

I have  tried everything to make her life as easy as possible so that she might  enjoy my company in the evenings, I organize and take the kids to school  and pick them up, I work a full time very profitable business I am own,  I do all the cooking and shopping, take the kids to after school  lessons such as swimming and music, do the dishes 90% of the time, wash  the kids and do a majority of the laundry.  I do this as she gets so  frustrated by chores and she tends to lash out at the kids or me if she  has to attempt to do any of these.

I  tried to be romantic, buy her gifts (nothing expensive, just things that  show I am thinking about her), take her on holidays (usually sexless),  go out to dinner by ourselves once every month all of this I have to  plan she will not do it herself.  She will always use the I'm too tired  or I don't feel sexy or she doesn't feel like it, so much so I have  given up even asking.  She would prefer to sit idle on the lounge watch shit TV and eat chocolate.  If in a blue moon she decides we should have sex it is usually with the phrase ""lets get this over and done with"".   So with this in mind we may have very boring sex, no foreplay, with me  doing all the work once a month if I am lucky.

I  am at the stage that I feel like we just shouldn't be together, I try  to speak to her about our situation but she will always turn a talk into  an argument very quickly with ""so it's my fault then"" which I just am  not into, I am trying to tell her my feelings and she will turn it into  her.

I want to ask her to commit to  coming to a relationship councilor to try that path but dread the  conversation and doubt she will commit to it.  I want our kids to grow  up seeing us enjoy each others company, loving each other, I fear what  they are seeing will affect their own relationships in the future. 

    **TL;DR;** :I  know I have let this go on too long and at almost 40 years old I have  wasted a lot of my life waiting for her to realize she is a sexual  being.  I really do love her and want to see her enjoy life and not  waste it.  My question is, what would you do if you were in this  situation?"
"My [23F] ""mentor""/coworker [40s F] makes me anxious and uncomfortable every time we talk.


So I posted about this briefly in r/Teachers because we're teachers, but it's just so awkward and uncomfortable and I'm not entirely sure how to handle people like this.

Basically, I was hired into my first teaching job (teaching math and science, including biology and environmental science) at a great school with a great administration. I thought that I liked the other (higher-level and honors) biology teacher, but I've come to realize that she can be extremely difficult to talk to. It's especially difficult because she is supposed to mentor me since she's in my department and I'm in my first year.

Rather than give positive suggestions, her attitude whenever she has tried to give advice (which is very rarely and unpredictably, as she mostly stays in her own classroom) seems to be ""you're approaching teaching wrong"". For example:

* She came into my classroom to ""observe"" completely unannounced (poor etiquette in teaching even from an administrator, much less a colleague) and in the last 15 minutes of the school day, listed all of the problems she had heard about or observed in my class, and said she didn't have time to help me come up with solutions but we would talk later. I was pretty panicked about it and talked with my vice principal, who said that the problems must not be major since she hadn't had any complaints. She said that the coworker tends to exaggerate and not to worry.

* When some students didn't want to attend a field trip that I was under the impression was optional (we had talked about it over the summer, but she just handed me the permission slips without further information about a week before the trip) she said that I must be approaching the class wrong. At one point she said, ""Didn't you read my syllabus from last year?...You're supposed to make them love science."" Even after I explained my perspective and my approach to the class and my lack of information about the field trip and apologized profusely, she remained negative and never once apologized for giving me so little information and essentially expecting me to read her mind. When I mentioned that some of my more motivated students didn't want to go because of another school event happening that day, she said, ""That's not an excuse.""

* She came into my classroom the day after the field trip incident to ""give more information"" about the trip, and asked me to go cover her class while she talked. A few of my students decided to go, and when I talked to one of them about it, she said, ""I'm surprised that more people didn't sign up. She made it sound like this would be a big part of our grade.""

* She will take any opportunity, no matter how small, to point out that my biology class is too easy (without citing any actual evidence or suggesting how to improve it) and how hard it is that no one who is not in her honors class will be prepared for future classes that she teaches (all non-mandatory). The only time I heard her explain her thinking was when she found one of my quizzes on the copier and described it as ""super easy"" without any further comment.

* She will share fairly personal details about her health, her marriage, her kids, etc. I'm never quite sure how to respond since one of her kids is in my class and her oldest is only a few years younger than me. I have no shared experience and don't share such personal things about my own life.

* She finds a lot of excuses to humblebrag, and has said or implied that (a) she and her classes are the reason that students come to the school; (b) it's uncomfortable for her to go to events with alumni because all they talk about is her class and it's awkward for the other teachers; and (c) that her teaching style is so superior that students only do poorly in her class because ""There's an adjustment period to having me as a teacher.""

* If I have any issues, it's just because my class isn't challenging enough or I haven't connected with my students about how it relates to their future careers. She uses her own students who are interested in medical fields as an example (again, she teaches higher-level biology courses). My students don't fit that description. If my freshmen have the next week of their lives planned it's impressive.

* She constantly complains about being busy, yet also complains that the principal will not let her start new programs/take on new responsibilities (I have no idea what she wants to add or change).

* Her daughter is in my biology class, does very well, and seems to like it, but whenever I say positive things about her daughter she is very careful to say ""She finds the *material* very interesting"" and make no comments whatsoever on what she thinks of the actual class.

* I'm not entirely sure how the students feel about her or what actually happens in her class and whether it's effective. I know she has good relationships with some of the students, but others have described her as ""scary"", one switched into my class because ""she actually wanted to learn"", and another one of my students said that a bunch of her friends want to switch into our class.

My instinct is to take her comments with a grain of salt since I am confident in my teaching style (as much as I can be in semester one of teaching on my own), she hasn't completed her teaching degree program (but has a PhD and taught at the college level), and my vice principal literally told me to take her comments with a grain of salt. But it's hard to feel like I don't have a lot of feedback and like I have this constant passive-aggressive presence in my life. I literally walk a little bit faster every time I need to pass her classroom door.


Any similar experiences/advice?

Ways to shift conversations with people like this? Or avoid conversations? Or get better at coping with the resulting anxiety/annoyance from conversations?


TL;DR: Coworker who is supposed to mentor me instead complains, shares oddly personal details, and attacks my class/teaching. It's honestly more stressful than the teaching itself sometimes."
"Should I(30M) tell my long term GF(25F) that I'm bi?


Well, I've known that I'm bi since I was about 21. I've never been ""out"" to anyone
 I've only hooked up with guys secretly.

I've been with my GF for 5 years and she is my absolute dream girl. I couldn't imagine being with anyone else and wouldn't never do anything to lose her. We live together and are a great couple. 

Now that I'm getting a little older, I'm realizing that I want to be completely honest with my GF. We are also getting really close to marriage. I want to tell her about my bi side, but she is a good girl and I know she will freak out. I know in my heart that she wants to be in a normal relationship and not with a bi guy. 

I'm not sure what I'm expecting if she were to actually accept me and still want to be with me. 

I don't want to lose her but I also want to tell her and have her accept me. 

Please help me. I'll be here to talk. thanks.

Tl;Dr should I tell my GF that I'm afraid to lose that I'm bi?;"
"Dealing with different sex drives


&amp;#x200B;

I (19F) feel like I'm always asking my bf (22M) for sex. It's not a dead bredroom by any means. We have sex once a day on average, sometimes twice and sometimes not at all. I would say his libido is high, but just not as high as mine.

Everytime my mind is free it goes back to sex and how good he's looking. When we have sex it's always been mind blowingly pleasurable, and it only seems to get better every time. Somehow.

Bit it's not regular enough for me.

I noticed that a large part of it is I want to show him how much I care about him. Sex is one way to do that. Other ways include doing nice things for him, like his share of the house work or making some of his favourite food. I also started taking care of my body a lot better so when we do have sex it's slightly nicer for him. And it helps me jog off my frustration.

He genuinely appreciates these things and thanks me for putting in extra effort in the flat and compliments my ass. This reaction is as good as the look on his face when he's watching me orgasm.

Since putting these things in place I've been bugging him for sex less, and he seems more relaxed around me. He isn't preparing himself to say no all the time, he's just enjoying the friendship. We joke more platonically as I'm not pushing every interaction with him into the bedroom, I'm just letting the situation be what it is, and trusting him to initiate when he wants something more

Not saying it's a solution for everyone with this issue, and I do still have the urge to pull his pants down and suck him off sometimes as little as half an hour after sex... but showing ""love"" in other ways really helped ease the awkward tension. And the relationship is a lot better for it now

TL;DR my(19F) libido is higher than my bf(22M)s. Showing care though housework and exercise instead of sex eases tension and improves ""friendship"" aspect of relationship"
"My crush [23/F] acts different around me and it's starting to worry me. [23/M]


There's this girl at work that I like and I know she likes me as well. Her friends have told me that she likes me and I can also tell by how she acts around me.

One thing I've noticed is how she tends to act around me depending on if we're alone together or if there are other people around us. Whenever we're in a group of large people, she'll talk to me and come off as her usual outgoing self and she'll look me in the eye and everything. But in the rare moments when we're alone together, she'll come off as really shy and introverted and she won't make eye contact when talking. It makes me worry that she doesn't like me anymore. Is this normal? 

tldr: Crush seems to change how she acts around me."
"I (18F) am absolutely just so in love with my fiancé (19M)


It’s currently 2:15AM and my LD fiancé is playing Red Ded 2 while I read relationship posts on reddit, life couldn’t be more grand. We’ve been together for well over 2 years now and with all our ups and downs I know I’m where I’m supposed to be. We talk. every. single. day (and no it’s not an exaggeration) We haven’t always been this lovey and for us being this young I know we’ll get the speeches about “a lot can happen in time”, but fate and God always bring us back together. As unhealthy as it might sound, we’ve broken up a total of 3 times now and see each other about every couple of months. To be frank, I wouldn’t have it any other way. I love him and our differences makes us stronger. We’re working on better communication and who wouldn’t love a man who takes initiative to better our relationship!! He’s the best person on this planet to my knowledge and he’s my best friend. My parents love him, family love him, friends love him, even my internet friends love him lol. I couldn’t ask for anyone else in my life than him, he’s everything I’ve ever wanted and more! Sorry for the ramble, I just love this man.

Thank you for coming to my TED talk.

TL;DR  This is me just talking about how in love I am with my fiancé !!!!"
"I (26M) am moving in with my girlfriend (24F) and there are some issues that are causing serious cold feet


So after being together for 16 months, for the last ~4 months my girlfriend and I have been talking about moving in together. However there's a few issues that are causing some serious grief and it's really making me doubt the feasibility and future between us.

For some background, I have been living by myself for the last 3 years and this has done wonders for my mental health. I am diagnosed with bipolar disorder and I've gone from being suicidal and in inpatient facilities; to now where I'm working full-time and studying at uni full-time and somehow balancing life inbetween.

My girlfriend also suffers with mental illness but has been living in a house with 2 other mentally ill people which has just created a whirlpool of a shit environment where no one is really recovering, has any expectations or long term goals. This has led to my girlfriend living with me for 4 days of the week, which for the most part has been great. But I am becoming a counselor who is sort of fixing what happens the 3 days that I'm not there.

Though the main issues surround our finances. Both of our leases run out in Jan/Feb and it sort of makes sense for us to live together. However in the 16 months of us dating my partner has refused to get a job due to her mental health. Whereas I see having something with a bit of structure will help her and this causes some conflict. She does go to uni part-time and while that helps, it doesn't help us financially so I am taking an overwhelming amount on to support us. 

I also have half agreed to pay more rent and all utilities so with the little money she does have she can use and do with what she see's fit. I don't want her to be 100% reliable on me because I feel like that's rather abusive to both parties.

I also feel just so exhausted carrying both her mental health, the finances, and my own shit on my back. I don't know what to do or how to approach this because it always leads to her breaking down into tears and me having to support and counsel her.

Tldr; I love my girlfriend but moving in together is making me have serious doubts because I am basically becoming a carer both financially and mentally."
"I (24M) live in CA and my (21F) gf is going to India for a month and I’m worried it’ll create too much space



We’ve been dating for about 4 months and given our schedules with school and work, we already don’t see each other as much as I’d like but it’s been good so far. Anyways, as stated she’ll be gone for a month or so visiting family in India which has about a 14 hour time difference. I still want to keep in touch whenever possible and have suggested we write each other but suspect that it might not be plausible because might not be possible due to family resistance.   

Have you gone through something similar and if so what would you have done differently or suggest?  

What should we expect?   

We’ve talked really minimal about it and I’m actually waiting on her text as I type this to see what she’s thinking and or planning to do with this time.

TL;DR gf leaving long term to different country. I don’t want it to get in the way and need creative ideas to keep in touch and keep things romantic.

Edit: family finding out is not a problem. Sorry but I incorrectly assumed it was."
"Am I (26F) being unreasonably mad at bf (27) for not picking me up at the hospital?


*Sorry for my grammar and spelling I am dyslexic foreigner.

Sorry if this is too long.

I had a tumble at work the other day and had to go to the emergency room at the hospital. My bf was still working and in another town so my mom went with me. I was very wonky and sometimes a bit out of it. I talked to bf a few times on the phone and thought he would come after work. After work he went home to feed the cats (good call) and I asked him to bring socks with him. He said he didn't feel like coming because he was tired. This ment my mom got stuck babysiting me.

Well we didn't really talk again until yesterday afternoon since I went straight to bed when I got home. He asked if I was mad because he didn't go to the hospital and I said yes. So he said ""Sorry, I was tired"" I was fuming at that point and my had my sister pick me up. I am currently staying with her. It's almost 7 am and I can't sleep. 

Backstory: I am overly clumsy and this is not my first trip to the hospital or my first concussion since we've been together.

My bf has trouble with sleep and is never rested. He also has a demanding job working 8-12 hours driving. I understand that he is always tired and maybe he is tired of my clumsiness.

I just feel that he's not often there for me but has to this point been when it's a big deal like hospital visit. He doesn't have much empathy for people in genneral and I know that. I just expect a little bit more sometimes.

Tl;dr Went to hospital after bad fall. Bf was too tired to come. Am I unreasonable for being mad and dissapointed?"
"My(20F) boyfriend’s(25M) lack of motivation and care for his future is wearing me thin.


My boyfriend and I have been together for 2 years. In the beginning, he talked about how much he loved education and wanted to eventually get a masters. He sounded so smart and motivated and I’m not going to lie it kind of attracted me to him. He was never sure on what career path he wanted, but I was always sure he was going to choose sooner or later.

I am very determined and have been focusing on building my IT career. I have two really great internships so far, I have always kept a job while being in school and I’ve always been in clubs and volunteering efforts. In short, I work my ass off. I also have some more internships coming my way, but I’m upset that I am so motivated and driven and my boyfriend has suddenly not cared about his future. 

2 years after we met, he has completed his credits but hasn’t gotten the degree because of a simple computer literacy test he didn’t know he had to take. He’s been pushing it off for months now. He also has been bad mouthing college, which is a complete opposite to the man I met in the beginning. He also won’t move out of his parents house even though he has a free apartment waiting for him that his rich relatives are practically paying for. I even had to beg him to get a job or I was going to leave him, which he eventually did get one (he was unemployed his entire time in community college). It’s so hard to get him to do something. I have to practically beg every time I need him to do something for himself. Its even hard to get him to do stuff for me. He never wants to listen to my concerns about our relationship (like this entire thing) and brushes it off. He honestly brushes everything off. I don’t even know what he cares about anymore. His room is even a mess. I can’t believe he can live this way. 

Anyways, I am upset because of his lack of motivation, his lack of care for his future, and his “woe is me” attitude to life and how he deserves everything and doesn’t have to work for it. 

I see that I need to breakup with him. But I’m hung up on how much I love him and all the nice things he has done for me. And maybe it’s because he’s my first boyfriend, I feel like I’m not going to be good enough for anyone else? I’m not sure why I keep hanging on to him if I can see I deserve better. Everyone in my life tells me I deserve better. My mom. My dad. My brothers. My friend. Even people who barely know us are surprised that I’m with him because even his appearance can be kind of messy sometimes. 

Is there a way to make this easy? What should I say? I love him so much. I have never loved anyone in my life like this. I really saw a future with him, but I feel like this is the end of the rope for me. 

**TD;LR:** My boyfriend’s lack of motivation for his future and care for me is really wearing me thin. I feel like a mother to him. I love him so much, but I think we may need to break up. I’m not sure. I love him a lot and I feel really bad."
"What do I [26TM] do about my crush on a coworker[30s M]?


TL;DR: Transgender guy working through a crush on a might-be-straight male coworker.

I didn’t even know I was into men before this guy, but I fell head-first into just the biggest infatuation. It’s been a real headache, to be honest.

Problem the first:
I don’t know if he’s gay, or bi, or whatever word you use to say “a guy who likes men with tits and a vagina,” because even though I pass as male, that is what I am sporting “under the hood” at the moment. I can’t get a read on him, one minute he’s talking about how he *must* see “Bohemian Rhapsody” and showing an excessive amount of expertise in men’s fashion (this guy’s shoes *alone* set off my gaydar), but then we’re talking about Dragon Age and he’s listing women as if they were the only romance options. He’s warm and then cold with me personally, too; sometimes it’s like we’re best friends and others he’s real distant. If he were straight, I could just drag this puppy love out back, put it down, and give it a tasteful private funeral, but I don’t know how to ask in a way that doesn’t make working with him awkward.

Which brings me to Problem the Second:
We work together. I see him all the time. I don’t want things to be awkward between us—well, things are somewhat awkward already, but really only for me, and only in a laughing-too-loud-at-his-jokes-before-fleeing-the-scene type of fashion. Which, while not the worst possible outcome, is also not a fun position to be in. I have too much hope to crush the crush, and too much fear to do anything but silently pine. And this pining limbo shit is getting OLD. 

What do I do, reddit?"
"I[17M] need some advice about this thing with my friend[17F], I really struggle with what to title this..


Okay so to start off, she's a really friendly person I knew from tuition. She asked for my number a few weeks ago and we've been talking quite a lot, and she sounds really happy to talk and doesn't try to end the conversation and on the contrary tries to pro long it.


Yesterday at about 5pm she told me that she was going to do some work and hence would be busy for awhile. She's one of my only friends I talk to on a daily basis so after those few weeks it kind of became a habit?


So this morning I messaged her ""hey good morning"" and unlike her usual ""heyoooooo"" response, she kind of ignored the message even til now


I'm not pissed or disappointed or sad or anything to that effect, I just feel like this is the start of something going downhill? I didn't really have friends in the past that would want to prolong a conversation or even talk, and after experiencing one, I really don't want to lose it. 


But at the same time, I don't want to come off as clingy. Also, I know she might still be busy but I just wanted to ask for advice about what to do in different scenarios of what could potentially happen.


p.s nothing happened between us that would make her feel like not talking to me(that I know of), and honestly I think I've caught some feelings for her but I didn't express it in any way whatsoever, but she's been flirting a bit and I've flirted back, though I didn't initiate anything


**TL;DR This girl who I talk to almost 24/7 is low-key ignoring me but I'm confused, and I really can't summarise this without making it half as long as the post so I guess if you don't mind please read the post? sorry**"
"My mother (41F) is shaming me (21F) for not working while I’m pregnant


[deleted]"
"I (21F) might've unintentionally started seeing my friend's (22M) crush (25M).


As the title says, I think I might've unintentionally seeing my friend's crush. I'm not very great at reading signals in other people and I might've jumped in without knowing my friend was flirting with (25M). 

We would joke that (25M) might be gay just with the way he holds himself and interacts with people, but I thought they were more so jokes and I think my friend thought it was serious. I'd seen (25M) dancing and flirting with other girls before we really knew each other, so I just kind of gave it a go. And now we're talking, not quite dating, but you get the gist. 

I guess now I'm a bit stumped on what to do. My friend has noticed that I've been spending time with (25M) and asked if I was dating him. I'm trying to avoid giving too many details, but basically he seeemed mad at the end of the conversation. 

I really hope I'm not overthinking all of this, but I have a feeling I might be correct. 

Any advice? I really don't want to lose my friendship, but I also really like this guy. 

Thanks!

Tl;Dr - I started seeing someone I didn't realize my friend had a crush on, but now that we're talking I think I'm realizing I missed the fact my friend liked the same person. "
"He (M/37) Truly Played me (F/30) for a Fool for almost 11 months


I'm not sure where to start off and everything to say. He decided to play games with my emotions and mind which he so falsely projected onto me first instead. - He broke up with me through text messaging which thinking back sounded indecisive yet bluntly clear. He is very skilled at pretending to be a ""good guy"" when he is really a bad guy in disguise who can and will use any power he can manipulate and control for his benefit.


Digging though my memory, he texted me several days after the last day of seeing him in person asking me a weird question as if something is wrong about what is going on with me. I suggested we meet in person to talk, but he acted out and became upset through text messaging and said that I wanted to communicate according to my very super specific terms. So, being the caring and giving person I am; I caved into duress. I answered his question honestly and clearly, yet he came off as if I had not aced his mind reading test.


During that time, I was so happily browsing clothes online that I eventually ordered to please him. It didn't sink in until the next day early at work about the entirety of what happened. So many feelings and thoughts flashed through my mind about how horrible and immature of a thing he had done to me - a grown 37-year-old man who willfully disrespected and depersonalized me through text communication. Then, everything I ever needed to have said to him came out through texts.


Then, the text communication between me and him started flowing. I finally was able to gain clarity as I put 2 and 2 together up to now about how he was really only concerned about his public self-image as he so speedily drove over to the coffee shop to discuss only concerns having to do with him. He's the type of person who is so full of himself that he just keeps talking - hogging the conversational space and answering questions I never asked him. After reflecting back on my own, I figured out he never truly loved me and was never concerned about me as words are just words without actions.


When I first had a real conversation with him; it was outside of my workplace by the water. I was going through a really tough time and I don't know how he does it but he made me feel as if I had always known him and I couldn't help feeling how much I needed to have him in my life. I never thought about a relationship, but he really kept coming at me and pressured - forced me into it.


He forced me and pressured me to do so many things I initially and clearly refused to do. I was so traumatized when he took my virginity without my consent and I still am. I was so confused that I just stayed with him thinking about how much my virginity means to me and how losing it without my explicit consent really crushed me. He couldn't keep his hands to himself for months prior to robbing me of my virginity, but after that incident he completely ignored me for 2 weeks.


Adding so many injuries to so many insults, he even outright ignored my birthday that January. When I got to see him in person again, he flat out yelled at me that he doesn't care about my birthday. I didn't know what to say. As I continued in the relationship for almost a year short a month, there came another incident where he again took me by force and even more so. I'm not sure what else I need to say anymore except that I really tried being happy and seeing all the good in this guy, but all he did was play stupid when he all along knew what he was after and all he intended to use me for - including feeding him, teaching him to be healthy, being there for him and comforting him, listening to him without judgment instead with understanding and support, doing his chores including gardening, and everything basically with limitless unconditional love.


He told me that I broke us up over petty things which was what he did - not me at all. He told me not to bottle any of my thoughts and emotions, but when I opened up, he flipped off and finally dropped my belongings off the night before the next day we were to talk in person again - he did so in an overly arrogant fashion and took a photo of it and sent it to me ignoring me standing right next to the gate. He told me I need to work on myself like I was never enough though he forced his will onto me. He told me he never wanted to see me and talk to me again and I don't know what else more to say at this time except that he makes too many promises and all of which he doesn't keep or never meant - he never loved me and doesn't care that I'm the one in pain and by myself.
​

Tldr; he knowingly forced his will onto me and intentionally used me for everything; then left me like meat trash"

"My (23F) parents are arguing due to my dad’s (60M) depression and I don’t know how to help


Hi everyone, it's my first time posting to reddit like this so I apologise for any mistakes I may have made.

I love my parents very much. They are so supportive of everything I do. Last month I moved out with my boyfriend to a different city to focus on my career. I keep in touch with my mum constantly and twice she’s brought up my dad, who is being unreasonable and miserable around the house. Small things set him off into verbal abuse, and while I was living with them I used to cry a lot due to their arguments. I hated listening to my parents fight about things they can’t control, or even worse, about what to have for dinner.

My parents have had an ongoing problem for the last 10 years with the family house. I won’t go into too much detail, but it isn’t able to be solved any time soon. It’s incredibly stressful, but they live in a lovely house and have a bit of money, so it’s not all bad. The community hates them due to the property they live in, due to unfortunate circumstances out of my parents control (it’s very confusing and I know I’m biased, but they honestly haven’t done anything wrong to receive such hate from their neighbours). 

Anyway, my point is that my mum will call me and tell me that dad once again stormed out of the house because she asked him to do some work or help around the house. He is clearly depressed but won’t get help or do anything about it, leaving my mum to just deal with it. She wouldn’t ever leave him but I feel I’ve left her on her own. He gets up late, drinks most nights, stays up late on his computer and leaves tools/building materials lying around the house. She tells me how much it brings her down and it breaks my heart. They’ve even been on a few holidays recently to try and cheer him up, and he’s been miserable there, too. 

He’s a great dad and so good at so many things, but when he’s down like this he is so horrible to my mum. I don’t know what to do, or if I can do anything about it. I’ve told him that he’s horrible to mum before during one of their arguments and he just kind of says “I’m sorry, that’s how I am”. I see a lot of him in myself and I hate it. 

I don’t really know what to expect advice wise, or if anything. I’m just at a loss and seeing if anyone can help me.


TLDR: My depressed dad doesn’t help around the house or work, and I moved out leaving my mum to deal with him. What can I do to help her?

"Friend [38, M] and I [31,F], relationship is off


I dated this guy about 7 years ago, it was really more FWB than anything else and when he fell off the map and I saw he was married on Facebook I was surprised but only slightly hurt. He hadn't officially broken up with me but to my eyes it was a relationship of convenience. He had been depressed most of that time, I was basically his emotional support, and we had sex. (He didn't support me emotionally. He was judgmental.)

He kept up contact over the years, but he popped up in my life again last year in a really intense way. Constantly texting me and flirting (over text because we live in different cities.) He was having a really bad time in his marriage and he is finally coming to terms that he needs a divorce. Again I am in the coach role, listening to his complaints about his wife and giving advice. I blocked him because he wanted me to be his mistress. But he always created a new account to contact me when he hit a new bottom. He has a history of suicide attempts so I felt like I needed to be there. He attempted suicide last year over a fight with his wife, and he very well could do it again now that he's filing for divorce over the holidays (which are important to him to be with family.)  I begged him to get therapy but he just lost his job and insurance after he finally went to one session. 

The problem is I feel like he never wants to just have fun with me. The fun conversations he used to lure me in have stopped and now he just wants to get shit off his chest. ALSO, the relationship we have over text is more intense and loving whereas IRL it seems distant. I've told him about it and he always says he'll do better. We've lived in different cities but he moved to my city (our hometown) last week and I feel like it will be more obvious and it makes me feel like shit. He is so depressed he isn't even flirting with me, so that's not a problem anymore, although it is a red flag for another suicide attempt.

The other problem is I'm in a transitional period where I am living with the parents and trying to rebuild my life (I am probably going to move away from here again). I don't have a social circle here and I've never really had a solid friend group. Just individual friends who live scattered across the region who I have to travel to visit. So I'm REALLY lonely.

Is this guy even interested in being my friend? When I see him in person sometimes it feels so distant even though we are constantly chatting. I feel like he thinks I'm kind of a loser and I know that I'm not a social butterfly, but I need my friends to treat me like they admire me!

Should I cut ties?

TL;DR: Emotional punching bag for suicidal/cyclically depressed friend. Should I ""dump"" him?"
"The person I [24M] considered my soulmate broke up with me over 8 months ago. I've now started dating again, but I keep comparing my new dates with her in the back of my mind. Everyone seems bland in comparison. How much weight do I give these thoughts? Am I jinxing what should be a new beginning?


I'm usually the sort of person who doesn't give up easily on somebody, and who is open to the fact that I don't know everything. Which is why I'm coming to you with this question.

Recently, about a month ago, I started dating somebody \[21F\]. She's a pretty smart, serious person, and I feel like I might be falling for her. The problem is that I'm constantly comparing her with my ex in the back of my mind, and that is seriously undermining any potential that this new fling with her might have. The answer might seem simple here: I'm not over my ex, and I should give myself more time to get over it. It's not that simple however.

In short, my ex \[23F\] (of 2 years) and I considered each other soulmates. We were so ridiculously intertwined in everything we did, thought and said, that to everybody who knew us (and to us!) it seemed like the most clear-cut case of *""yep, those two will end up marrying one day""*. She could make me laugh like no other, and vice versa - if I were fooling around at a party, she'd always be the one whose big smile I'd catch from across the room. She looked up to me immensely, and I looked up to her. We're both ambitious and in college, doing double degrees (she in law and a related field, me in engineering and a related field). Literally, all of our time was spent together. 

We lived about 40 minutes away from each other in neighboring college towns, and if one of us had a long day and only had about an hour left before bedtime, we'd still travel to the other person just so we could sleep together. But most of the time, she lived with me (I have an apartment and she has a room, so she spent pretty much every minute of every week at my place, except for a few hours on Sunday evening when she'd have cleaning duty with her roommate...in hindsight it's a wonder we didn't cancel her rental agreement with how much time she was spending at my place). 

We'd write each other letters if one of us would go someplace for a week without the other, and we'd hate every day of it to the point where we'd feel deeply crappy all the time until the day the other returned. We'd go on adventures and we did so many things together, from exploring new interests to just doing plain old cute couple-stuff, which was made even cooler by the fact that we were totally different in terms of interests but open to everything because we were so incredibly close and identical, emotionally speaking. 

We would look so lovingly at each other that I've literally had friends and family members pull me aside to tell me that they'd never seen a girl look at a guy with so much love and care as she did, and that I better keep her close for the rest of my life. One time, some granny who we didn't even know came up to us on the street just to tell us how much she liked seeing us together. She supported me heavily when I was broke. I supported her heavily with her degrees and studying for it during a tough period in her life when the stress started getting to her. She understood me like no other, even with my many faults coming from an abusive war-traumatized household, and my way too awful temper. And so did I with her, with her every fear and flaw. 

Unfortunately, around this time last year, I started developing something that looked like a really bad depression with anger issues. After 4 months of this gradually getting worse and spiraling out of control, she broke up with me in March after she suffered a literal clinical burn-out from the emotional stress of seeing me mess myself up this way and trying to support me through it, which must have been impossibly exhausting and unrewarding for her. I've never been able to forgive myself for it, even though I know she has. She has never held it against me. If anything, she'll probably find a way to fault herself. 

We've talked once since the break-up after about 5 months had passed, on the phone late at night, and we both cried through the whole thing. The last time I contacted her was 2 months ago, when I got almost black-out drunk and whatsapped her about 80 messages about how much I had loved her, how I can't believe our tiny, loving, parallel universe had disappeared, and about how I could never forgive myself for what I'd done. The next morning I felt incredibly embarrassed and told her to ignore those messages, but all of my messages have remained unread to this day, which means she probably deleted the chat as soon as she woke up and saw it pop up.

With all this this written out you might be inclined to think; well, if I didn't think you weren't over this woman yet when I first began reading your post, I sure do now! And I get that. The thing is, this wasn't my first serious relationship. I've been heartbroken before. Mostly though, I missed having a significant other: I missed the role first and foremost, and less the person. It's the other way around now. It's that I actually miss the ***person*** that my ex was. And, from what you can read up there, that's an impossibly tall order. 

Moreover, it's not something that I'll be able to just ***get over***. I've already switched colleges, moved, had a new start, joined a few societies, started up a few projects. I don't feel like there's any significant heartbreak still in me at the moment. Not the sort that should stand in the way of a new start. Because, ultimately, it's the person that I miss.  And you can't really get over that. You can just meet somebody else, some other person, who can show you that she's just as magical or maybe even more so than the previous one, but in a different way. And for that to happen, you have to be open to the idea of a new start. Which I'm struggling with, because that new person has big shoes to fill. 

My ex wasn't all magical straight away either. There was a lot of painful getting to know each other for half a year before the curtains fell and fireworks popped into my life and hers. In fact, I distinctly remember lying in my bed, staring at the ceiling and shaking my head at the idea of us falling in love when I was getting to know her, when we were just casual friends with benefits. She didn't seem like the right person at all. And how wrong I was... How do I know I'm not jinxing that right now with this new girl by thinking about quitting it? I probably thought that thought many times when I was getting to know my ex. But I was 21 then, and I'm 24 now. A little bit older and a whole lot more complacent because of what I used to have. Maybe my heart's not in it because I can't imagine going through all that again with somebody who seems so much less than what the previous person used to be. But how on earth could I ever trust that judgement?

**TL;DR: I \[24M\] started dating somebody \[21F\] about a month ago. I keep comparing her to my ex, who meant the world to me and who broke up with me earlier this year, and I think that's unfair to the new person. However, realistically, it's messing with my potential for a new start, and I'm not sure how much weight to give to reoccurring doubts and comparisons. Is this the inevitable unease of a new beginning that is bound to happen sooner or later, or am I not over my past relationship yet? And how do I get over it in the vacuum of not dating and not exploring?**

"I [17F] want to forgive my mom's [46F] infidelity.


When I was around nine or ten, I started to suspect that my mom was having an affair with a coworker. At first, there were little signs: she was constantly texting someone, but would always hide her screen from me when I walked by; she would come home late from work claiming that she was shopping, but often arrived empty handed; etc, etc. 

One evening, he showed up to gift her a new hairdryer (hers broke the night before). As he left, my mom walked him to his car, which was unusual, so I snuck into the garage to eavesdrop. He was asking her for a goodnight kiss; she kept saying no, then he asked for a hug and finally she relented. At the time I was relieved — my mom didn’t seem interested in him — but later that night she confronted me and told me off for eavesdropping. I wondered what would’ve happened if I wasn’t there. 

A couple months later, I was on her laptop to check my emails, but I was automatically logged into a strange account. That’s when I saw the emails from him: “I love you, I miss you, I’m hiding in the bathroom and writing this on \[his son\]’s ipod so \[his wife\] doesn’t see.” I started to cry. When my mom found me, she acted like she didn’t know whose account it was but came to hug me later that night, telling me that she loved my dad and that the emails were just a joke between her and her coworker.

After this happened, I was devastated. I felt very resentful toward my mom for lying to me and I felt guilty about not telling my dad (I worried that it would break up the family). My siblings didn’t know (they still don’t) and I only brought it up to my mom a few times when things got very heated between us and I couldn’t hold it in any longer. She always denied it and got angry with me for not believing her. Over the years I grew distant from her and closer to my dad.

Nowadays, my parents are still together but my relationship with my mom is often uncomfortable. I love her so so so much, but we bicker often and I can tell that it hurts her to see that I’m so much closer to my dad. Still, I can’t help but feel the same resentment that I felt back then, especially because she was never willing to talk about the affair and continued to deny it over and over. Sometimes I even start to doubt that it happened, and I wonder if maybe it really was a joke, and then I feel guilty for treating my mom so bitterly.

What I want more than anything is for her to admit that it happened so I wouldn’t have to feel so conflicted, but I doubt she ever will. In any case, I’m too afraid to confront her again because I don’t want to hurt her with the knowledge of just how significantly her affair impacted me. 

I'm really just posting for advice on how to forgive her by myself. Help?

Tl;dr: A few years ago I discovered my mom's affair, but she denies it and I still can't help but feel hurt."

"Should I [22F] continue with therapy?


I'm currently going to a low cost therapy clinic to work on my self esteem issues. The maximum amount of sessions they offer is fifteen. I only came to the full realization that my self esteem issues were symptomatic of deeper trauma around say, session 5.

I just completed session 7 yesterday meaning that I have 8 sessions left. I haven't told my therapist about my past trauma or my attachment to her.

Is it worth trying to unearth the trauma when there are only eight sessions left or am I better off closing the chapter entirely until I find a new therapist who can work with me long term?

Or should I just continue the work with her and then when it's done find a new therapist?

I'm stuck because we have a really good relationship and it would hurt me to leave her so early. I've been to three other therapists before her and I haven't felt nearly as connected to any of them. I've been crying on and off about it since last night. I wish I'd have spoke up about my issues earlier and now it's too late.

**TL;DR:** I've been attending therapy for seven sessions. The max is fifteen sessions. I discovered that I have a lot more issues than I orignally thought-- I'm not sure that it can be fully addressed in eight sessions. Is it worth trying to unearth the trauma when there are only eight sessions left or am I better off closing the chapter entirely until I find a new therapist who can work with me long term? Or should I just continue the work with her and then when it's done find a new therapist?"
"Why is she still texting me? What her her motives?


I was with this girl for 3 years until we broke up about a month ago. We started off long distance than I eventually moved her to stay with me and my family because her home situation was not that good at all. Eventually she decided to move back home and i said I didn't want to do long distance but she kept saying yes yes so i said whatever we can try it. Then we went on a break because we were arguing a for a little and then recently she's been trying her hardest to ignore me and finally when i had enough of literally a month of her just ignoring me purposely when i actually had things to tell her I confronted her pretty angrily and she said basically she wanted to cut things off by being distant and that she said she wanted a break to try to hide how she really felt saying she didn't want a relationship anymore which shows basically the type of person she is not even having the decency to tell me that not on the phone but even though text. We then got into a really bad fight like basically the one where breakups head. We insulted each other viciously and basically she texted me one final thing saying my insults are the last impressions she's going to have of me even though she was insulting me as well and as if i didn't do anything for her in the last three years. She then said i just want to forget about you and not have anything to do with you and then we didn't speak for about a month and she blocked me after that. She said she wanted to stay friends for the sake of our history but after the fight she said she doesn't even think we can't contact each other anymore and i wasn't interested in becoming friends with someone I went through that much stuff with breaking my back for her at all times just to be seen as her friend ultimately and I told her i wasn't interested in that and id rather not be.

To keep things short i did stuff for her on a consistent basis that her family wouldn't even do for her so its to that extent over three years. Plus I even moved her across the country with me just so she could have much better opportunity for pretty much everything. She texted my mom shortly after the fight saying she holds a lot of love towards me but she needed her space for right now which i don't really get what her motives are then said maybe in the future me and her would be togther only god knowns is what she said something along those lines. Then she texted me on thanksgiving saying happy thanksgiving and a very long paragraph saying she holds a lot of care in her heart towards me and that she appreciates what I've done for her and to take care than all i said was thanks and thats about it. Then a few weeks later she texted me out of nowhere again to try to give me some help about some business stuff that i do that she encountered and told me some advice that would help me and again all i said was thanks and thats about it. Why does she keep texting if she doest want me in her life anymore and saying she wants to forget about me? \*\*TL;DR;"

"Dilema


 Hi. So I've been with this guy for 2 years and 4 months. Have been living for almost 2 years. In the course of our relationship, we've discussed or talked about sex and masturbation. Every time he says he doesn't do it, doesn't see the point, only bored people do it. Today, while he was at work, I was thinking what to get him for Christmas. I was drawing a blank. I then thought to myself, he spends a lot of time on the internet and likes computers and stuff, surely I will be able to find stuff he wants to buy himself and I could surprise him. Now let me say this, his computer is a new one, about 8-9 days old. When I go through his browsing history I see subreddits with women with round big fat asses( the rest of their body is thin) and lots of deepthroat pics and videos. The time stamps basically show that he's watching these things at work in the morning, mid-afternoon and sometimes in the evening, like when he's taking a shower. I am now furious, not because of what he's looking at( though I feel pretty shitty because my ass does not look nice and he's and ass man) but because he lied to me, numerous times. Making it sound like he's above self-pleasuring and all that crap. I feel disgusted with him/by him now that I know this. I feel betrayed. I thought we tell each other everything. Now I wonder, what else he could be lying about. It's not like I ever told him ""oh, no, porn is bad, don't ever watch it"". I watch porn, he knows this. I even tried playing a few videos to get is in the mood a good few times, and he always acts coy or, this doesn't do anything for me or not interested, but clearly he his. Do you guys have any advice? 

TL;DR - was looking for x-mas ideas, found bf's history filled with porn(lied about not watching countless times), now I'm upset and not sure if I trust him anymore."
"Feel guilty after a break-up in a 2 yr relationship I was not into. Was mean during break-up. What should I learn/do?


I (m29) was in a relationship with a girl (f28) for 2 years. We were in school when she expressed her feelings. I expressed my not having similar feelings for her, but wanted to remain friends with her. At times, we became very close and intimate, and didn't know what we were getting into. 


During our internships,we were in different coasts . In one of our conversations, I mentioned we needed to have some space, bring down our intimacy levels a bit. 


When we rejoined our school, we fought over it - she said she couldn't be friends with me if she could not love me. Plus, we were in school, it was impossible to stay away from each other. We had a really satisfying friendship - we were honest, cared for each other and and kind at other's mistakes. We also needed each other's help to find a job after school. So I chose to stay intimate and close to her. We were happy.


We did have occasional tensions - she always felt she was more into our relationship and I couldn't deny it. I made it a point to keep her happy (be less of an asshole by reminding her why we didn't work, why I liked her as a friend - as I used to do in the past), and it was really satisfying to be so.


Now, we are in 2 different cities. We did talk about our relationship running its due course - we were getting tired of our choice ( I wanted to move on, and she wanted to marry me). We knew we were breaking up.


On our last call, she asked me what being close and intimate to her meant to me, and why did I use the relationship as a convenience. I really felt cornered and anxious listening to that question and I snapped at her.


I told her I was always uncomfortable with being intimate with her and was giving out subtle hints of my discomfort. At that time, I realized I had screwed up big time!! We had a happy and healthy time with each other, and now my words had tainted our 2 year's memories.


While I realize there were moments of anxiety, that definitely was not something to be brought up on our last call. I feel really guilty. I know she feels stupid and doubtful thinking about our past. This would also affect her self esteem.


At this point, I cannot think of an honest way to make her feel good about our past. I feel ashamed and helpless about this situation. I feel I have been selfish in the past by staying in the relationship that I knew would not last (hope was we'd be friends). I feel sad to have hurt her in our last call in an insensitive way.  


I am looking for your help in figuring out how to grow and learn from this situation.

TL;DR - 1. Was in a relationship I was not that into (hoping friendship would prevail). 2. Got triggered during break-up and told her she made me anxious in the past, and could not pick up the hints. Spoiled our memories - how do I redeem myself?"
"My bf (20m) never pays attention to me (19f)


ok so me and my bf have been together for just over a year and 2 months now - I absolutely adore him to bits, but I feel like it’s so one sided but I’m also not sure if that’s just how he is?

We both play video games (both PC), but he will only ever want to play with his friends and will never invite me to play with him, I work 9-6 most days and a lot of the time at the end of the day I want to just sit with him for an hour or so and just chill and talk about shit, but he never wants to. He refuses to come off of his PC and there’s rarely a day he’s not on it. He does work and go to uni a lot, so I completely understand wanting to play games to unwind etc and he even said to me that gaming is his ‘happy place’ - to which I questioned is he not happy when hanging around me, he immediately denied that and said I was thinking too deep into it.

I cannot remember the last time he done something for me, just to be nice, without me asking. Or even him suggesting to do something with me, it’s always me that arranges it or asks him. 

He always gets mad at me for wanting to do anything with him. I’ll suggest getting food or watching a film, he just says it’s boring and he doesn’t want to do it. It hurts my feelings so much but he gets pretty angry if I ever suggest that he’s upset me or if I try and talk to him about this stuff as he just can never accept what I say. He always shuts it down. 

He goes out a lot with his friends, again, I have no issue with this. I only get upset because he goes out to quiz nights with his friends, or for a drink or for a drive etc, his friends always ask why he doesn’t invite me. So that just proves he clearly doesn’t want me there. (Again, I don’t expect this all the time. Just once in a while I’d love to hang out in a group together.) 

We do live together, so I get he sees me physically a lot, but he never actually spends time with me. He says ‘I’m always with you and spending time with you’, but he literally counts that as me sitting there on the bed while he plays games with his friends.

What would you do? I love him so much, I just wish he paid more attention to me sometimes. He never compliments me. He never does anything for me. It’s like he acts like it’s a chore for him to love me but he’s never suggested that he doesn’t love me anymore or doesn’t want to be with me, if anything he’s pretty opposite and will usually say he loves me and stuff occasionally. It’s odd.

tldr; bf never pays attention to me, never wants to spend time with me, never instigates anything with me, basically I do all the work. I just want him to show he loves me. "

I know that would be wrong/disrespectful but Im terrified of being single and not being able to find anyone like her ever again. Should I stay with current bf, break it off and tell Amy how I feel, or break it off and move on and look for someone else?

&amp;#x200B;

Hey guys. I don't even know where to start with this, but I'll try to make it as brief as possible. 

&amp;#x200B;

So I'm a little quirky-- its not easy for me to make friends, open up to people, and meet new people I genuinely get along with. I'm good at putting on a mask and being polite/civil/friendly, but when it comes to actual friendships and mutual understanding its extremely rare for me to find any. Idk if its my brain is just a little different,  plus there are just htings about my life that have just made me very different from the average person (I grew up in an Amish community, escaped, managed to barely get thru college. thats the biggest thing). So I dont really have any friends, besides my bf (m/30) and maybe one or two other people i keep in touch with occasionally. 

&amp;#x200B;

I decided to do something about this recently and joined a photography group. Im pretty artistic and thought itd be fun to have an outlet, plus i needed to force myself to get out and meet people for once too. Well first day I joined the club, this girl introduced herself to me, lets call her Amy (f/25). she was super sweet and rly knowledgeable, gave me lots of tips and tricks shes learned from being in the club for a while. we talked like the whole time, and I started realizing i had feelings for her. Ive never been attracted to a girl before so I was really confused at first, but after a week or so I started realizing I was falling for her. Hard. Ive never felt this way about anyone before, not even my current bf. I dont know if that makes me a lesbian or bi or what, I dont even care, I just feel like Ive never been this in love in my life. 

&amp;#x200B;

So of course, after that I keep my distance. Idk how to approach her bc I am in this relationship with my bf already. I love him so much and would never want to do anything to hurt him, but the truth is we are just lving together out of mutual loneliness. Dont get me wrong he is really great- we have a lot in common, share a lot of the same views, and have so much fun together. but the spark just isnt there and we both know it. we havent had sex in 3 months but despite that i love him so much and can really see a future with him. Weve been together for 7 yrs and been planning on getting married soon. It just seemed like the logical step to take. But ever since meeting Amy I just feel like I cant stay with him any more in good conscience, knowing I have these strong feelings for her. I dont even know her super well, but the way she makes me feel is amazing. 

&amp;#x200B;

Its really ironic that in my first relationship I sort of 'tested' my  now-ex by asking him ""would you rather marry your best friend who you get along with and share similar views with, even if you're not in love? or would you rather marry someone you're super in love with even if you fight and  dont have a ton in common with?"" I told him he ""failed"" his test when he chose ""love"" over ""compatibility"" because he said love conquers everything. I understand what he means now. 

&amp;#x200B;

So onto the main problem-- we are both in relationships and i dont know anything about hers, because i feel it isnt right to pry and i dont want to make it seem like i'm asking her to leave her partner. just from what ive seen on fb they've been together for a long time, too, so i feel horrible for having these feelings. but its like i cant get them to go away, and i have a feeling she has them too. nothing has happened really, i just have this feeling... its horrible and the most difficult situation i think ive almost ever had... if I could, I would drop everything to be with her but that is crazy. I feel crazy!!! I dont want to make things difficult for her and I dont even know if she would ever actually wanna be with me. So im terrified that if i end things with my bf, even though I know I should because we are more like roommates than bf/gf, I wont ever find love again. I would risk it for this girl but its so scary to think about the possibility of being single. Maybe I should just join a dating website. What do you guys think:

&amp;#x200B;

a) stay with my bf, get married, get lonely occasionally bc we dont love each other but enjoy the companionship and be grateful for a good relationship

&amp;#x200B;

b) dump my bf, tell Amy how i feel and risk the rejection 

&amp;#x200B;

c) dump my bf, forget about Amy and try to meet someone who is not taken 

&amp;#x200B;

Im afraid I wont find anyone like her every again. Any advice is appreciated, I have been crying on an off for the past week I am so stressed &amp; guilty. Feel like a poc. Thank you v muhc."
"Male 31 completely shattered.


 

Alright... I don't ever post anyhting personal on any social site so here goes. This will probably be very long.

So  first and foremost I love my wife with all of my heart and soul. I have  and always will love her like the first time i saw snow, or watched a  sunset on the beach.

Backstory: Were both  military and met in Japan in 2010 and married in 2012. She has had a  lot of family trauma growing up. Rape, violence, and her first husband  stabbed he on her wedding night, she was married 3 times before me, but  she is my first marriage. I also grew up in a violent drug infested  household so, I guess you can see where we understood eachother and  bonded. Ill spare you most of the details but instead try to get to the  meat and potatoes.

I am an introvert, she  is an extrovert and very social. And being in the military, a socail  butterfly that is my wife can attract a lot of unwanted attention. But  for the first 4 years of our marriage she was on antidpressants and she  was diagnosed with split personality disorder (a lot of people have this  in fact). She likes to drink (probably to wash away the pain from her  past) and I don't have a vice that I use to hide pain. She got on this  medication after we were married and that is when we stopped talking all  the time. We used to talk about everything and lay in bed and have  pillow talk and I loved it. But as time went on she became more and more  enveloped in work. this went on form 2014 to 2018 where she would work a  lot. sometimes 12-14 hours a day when she didnt have to. So I became  regressed and started to play videogames a lot as a form of  entertainment and because I really had nothing else to do. So you can  see we have grown apart here.

Any time we  did have time to spend together she would want to go drink somewhere.  And I like to drink, but in the fashion of having a few to get a buzz  and call it quits. She on the other hand will drink untill she blacks  out most times. So whenever she wanted to do something i said no. Not  because I didn't want to be with her but because i didn't want to do  anyhting revolving around being drunk.

I am also a ""car guy"" so I had a lot of car friends and would always be doing somehting semi productive and sober.

We grew apart emotionally but the love aspect was never gone. I have always been in love with her and always will love her.

So heres my sob story after a brief background.

Oct 2018 she deploys at the beginning of the month.  
Oct 10 hurricane Michael hits Panama City (We own a house there and have our best friends renting)  
Oct 24 her german shepeherd suddenly dies from kidney failure (I was a fucking mess) 8 years with this dog.  
3 days later she sends me a letter telling me she isnt ""in love"" with me anymore.  
Nov 5th I find out she has been seeing this guy and having sex while deployed.

So my life lesson planner just filled up really fast.

She  knows I know and we have been talking almost every day and i asked her  about it and she didnt deny it. She says she needs time to ""find  herslef"" but in my mind thats woman talk for I want to fuck people  without feeling guilty. And i tell her I love her and have also done a  lot of self reflection on why she may have felt the need to cheat. her  rationale was she thought i was going to hurt her so she did the ""strike  first"" mentality.

She tells me she  doesnt want to think while shes out there and she doesnt want to feel.  Maybe because it will make her vulnerable ? i don't know. I need some  insight from the ladies.

Sorry if this is jumbled and may not make sense. I never do this so i'm not very good at explaining life to strangers haha!  


TLDR - married 10 years, wife cheated, don't want to end the marriage, we still communicate every day, she knows i know, didn't deny it, still tells me she loves me.. i need advice. "

"My former best friend (30/m) who assaulted me (23/F) tried to contact me


TL;DR: my former best friemd who assaulted me has been trying to get in contact with me. What donI do?


First of all, I apologize for my formatting as I am on mobile. English is also not my first language so please ask me to clarify anything. My thoughts and feelings are jumbled right now so things might not make sense.
3 years ago, I cut my friends out of college becauase of the shytty things they did to me. I just graduated and had no friends at all after cutting them. The rest of my friends moved out of state after graduation. This guy, let’s call him Andy, was the ex boyfriend of one of the friends I cut out (also a male) reached out to me not long after. They dated for a while and broke up and we never met again. We became fast friends. We hung out almost every day and called each other best friends. We were both on tinder (and he on grindr) at that time and he encouraged me to go on dates and put myself out there. I did and met my current boyfriend.
When my boyfriend and I first started seeing each other, I noticed Andy became increasingly jealous and possessive. I would tell him that I have a date with John and he would be upset that I didn’t reply to his messages. And it’s not him checking in with me to see if i’m okay, it’s needy stuff. I have told me multiple times that I don’t check my phonea during dates because I enjoy my time with John and also it’s rude.
One day, Andy and I went out drinking on a weekend with our other friend. I didn’t feel like drinking so I drove both of my friends home. Usually when I had too much to drink, I stayed over at Andy’s house because I didn’t want to drive back and I felt safe because he’s my friend and he wouldn’t do anything as he’s not attracted to women. After I dropped my friend off at his apartment, Andy forcedfully kiss me. I waved it aside as he had too much to drink. Then, I took him to the apartment he shared with his sister. His sister had her bf over and locked her door in front of us after the bf came. Andy immediately picked the lock and barged into her room. I was horrified and chased after him. His sister and her bf were yelling at him and when Andy saw me running in, he pushed me towards her sister’s bed and grinded on me. They had to get him off of me and kicked us out. I told him to go to bed because I’m leaving soon. He begged me to stay and I refused. He ran to his balcony (?) and threatened to jump off if i still refused to stay. I had to scream for his sister and she rushed out and told me to go home immediately.
I did not register what happened that time or that I was assaulted. He texted me the next day saying that he did not remember a thing. I started to pull away because i couldn’t make sense of the incident and also I’m starting to get serious with John. I’ve met him a couple times after that incident and it has been 2 years since. I mostly ghosted him. Never replying to his texts and he backed off for a while. When the metoo movement gained traction, i was like ‘ holy shit! That makes sense why i don’t want to see him anymore’. Recently though, he posted a facebook memory of our picture. Now he’s been asking to meet up with me and i’ve ignored them. The thing is, i have a panic attack everytime i see someone that looks like him. I walked away or hid behind my friends. Wheneve he clicked attend on an event i was going to on fb, i immediately felt a sense of dread. I don’t want to meet him and have to explain myself on why i’ve been ignoring him. We live in a pretty small city so the chance to run into each other is likely. I don’t know what to do. Any advice is appreciated. Thank you

"My [26F] SO [29M] and I can't seem to make our sex life work, together for 5 years


Re-posting because last post was locked due to not having a question.

 I feel so angry and depressed all the time. It feels like an area of static in my chest, which grows stronger and darker every day we don't have sex. I apologize for the length of this post, I need to vent. PLEASE don't just tell me to break up. SO is reading the post and can respond. What can he or I do to improve our sex life? We're both committed to making our relationship work and open to suggestions from anyone who has been through something like this before or anyone else who can provide some wisdom.

We have been together for nearly 5 years now. Here is where I describe how lovely our relationship is other than this one thing. We get along together so well. We just mesh. We like the same things, we like the same people, we think the same thoughts, we have the same sense of humour. We do mind-altering substances together and that strengthens our bond even further. He is a kind person, he really understands how to deal with me and is very patient and always tries his very best to make me happy (except for the sex thing). He is quick to admit when he is wrong and never holds a grudge. He's hardworking and very smart and full of ideas. His family has long since accepted me as one of their own. He's just a really great person and someone that I know I can spend the rest of my life with. I can't imagine what a deeper bond with someone would look like. But we have never had a good sex life.

For the first 3 years of our relationship, I had a very healthy libido and I was down for anything. I would regularly ask to give him blowjobs because I wanted to. I'd try to initiate sex nearly every day. I sent him a few dirty pics but his responses were ""haha"" and ""ooo"" which made me feel so bad and I haven't done it since though it really turns me on. He would get handjobs/blowjobs whenever he wanted, and would get them very frequently during my periods. For these, I would not get anything in return, especially not during my period. To this day he has not once done anything for me without expecting (and subsequently getting) something in return. I got turned down maybe 9 out of 10 times I initiated sex (and even sometimes when I just wanted to blow him). He was always too tired, had too much work to do, was too anxious, his parents were next door (we live in an apt attached to their office), it was too early in the morning, too late at night, he ate too much, he had a headache. Once he told me it was because I was fat so I lost 30 lbs for him. Then I was too flabby for him at 120 lbs. After literally years of rejection and feeling undesired and unattractive I just stopped initiating and my sex drive all but vanished.

The only thing we ever fight about is our sex life. We fight about it once every month or two. These fights always end with him promising to be better but NOTHING ever happens, except he started eating me out more and tries to initiate more. He will research for hours about any inane thing that piques his interest but he has not spent more than like 5 hours our whole relationship looking up anything to do with sex. In January of this year we had a huge day-long fight. He finally realized he needed to take me seriously when I tell him how horribly I feel when he doesn't give me any sexual attention. I found a book for him after googling for no more than a minute which he read and which seemed to spark something in him (Mating in Captivity by Esther Perel). I worked out for a few months and started looking less flabby, grew a bit of a butt and it actually seemed to get him more interested in me. He started being the one to initiate. But in a cruel twist of fate, I started feeling very anxious when he would initiate and we basically reversed roles, I would turn him down constantly and was totally uninterested in sex. Then I just lost interest in working out.

Most of the time in our relationship, I feel more like his mother than his sexual partner. I am constantly cleaning up after him. He has never cleaned the bathroom, it wouldn't even occur to him to clean the microwave or the fridge or the kitchen floor. I cook and grocery shop and do the dishes - though he sometimes helps chop stuff, sometimes does the dishes, and sometimes will come with me to shop for groceries because he feels bad for me doing all the work. If I stopped doing these things our apt would be a mess. I know because it used to be a mess before I moved in and every time I go through a depressive episode and can't do anything it starts to turn into a filthy mess again. He had an injury last month and has had to use crutches so anything he does that involves him moving, such as getting a glass of water, or getting his clothes from the drawer, takes him a while to do so I just do it for him most of the time. He asked me what he can do for me in return. I told him I want more sexual attention. I have in fact received even less sexual attention. Probably because I am being even more of a mother to him.

He's admitted he doesn't desire me. He just views me as someone he loves and not a sexual being. He gets mad at me for turning down his advances when they are obviously fake and only happen because he knows I am expecting something. A couple of weeks back I was just standing in front of him naked, in a completely non-sexual way, and he said that he felt pressured into sex because of that. The way he touches me - there is no energy or intent behind it. A friend of his once asked him, in reference to playing the guitar, why it seemed like everyone was playing music while he was always just practicing chords. It’s exactly like that. He likes kissing and pays a lot of attention to my breasts, but anything below that is just ignored. Not ignored as in he doesn't touch them but ignored as in he wouldn't care if they didn't exist. He does eat me out and confessed to me that he's recently started to actually enjoy that. Small victory, though I'm not totally sold. He is grossed out by period sex, we’ve done it a handful of times by now (well, only once when I was actively bleeding) and he’s only just tolerated it. He refuses to put any part of him near my ‘anus’ as he calls it because ew poop comes out of there. Once on MDMA (on fucking MDMA!) he told me he doesn’t like the look of my shriveled pussy when I’m not aroused. I don't understand what's wrong with me. I'm pretty, slim at 120 lbs, I keep myself clean and shaved down there obsessively (because he made one comment about it during year 1), I am willing to do anything sexually. He makes me feel so insecure and so bad about myself. I want him to want me, to worship my body, to not make me feel disgusting by physically pushing me away when my completely clean asshole goes anywhere near his face (or even his fingers!). I want him to do stuff to me because he wants to please me and not because he wants to get off. I want him to touch me without expecting me to do anything in return because he actually just wants me. I don’t orgasm during sex and I’ve told him in the past that the orgasm is not the goal of sex for me so he’s taken this to mean that I don’t care at all about cumming ever and once he gets off, we’re finished, and he does not offer to help me masturbate. I haven't even told him about any of my desires or fantasies because he already thinks I'm a sexual deviant because I see nothing wrong with ass play (NOT poop stuff). I can’t talk to him anymore about how I feel without him getting mad at me for not being pleased with what he’s giving me.

tldr; Both my SO and I agree I am more of a mother to him than a sexual partner and it makes me so miserable. His words and actions have made me feel incredibly insecure and unsexy. We're both frustrated. What can we do about our sex life?"
"[19M] My little brother [14M] told me he wants to go into the same field as me and it scares me


I’m currently doing a difficult computing course after doing maths and further maths at A level and barely and I mean barely making it through 

My little brother today told me he wants to do computing like me and become a game developer like I want to and as much as I’d love for him to do that I can’t help but feel scared that he won’t be able to do it

From a young age I had an almost natural ability at maths and that is the only reason I made it through what I did because I will openly admit I was a lazy student and underestimated how challenging it could be and it hit me hard

My brother on the other hand is even lazier than I am and doesn’t have this natural ability and is also completely oblivious to how difficult things will be 

He is already struggling at GCSE level, although he does have a year to turn it around, but again he is unaware that he is doing as badly as he is and was shocked when his midyear reports said he was underachieving 

My course is very demanding and I live an hour from home so it would be very difficult for me to support him and manage my own stuff as well

Myself and my parents have spoken to him and he is still completely oblivious and just says ‘I know’ when we say how difficult it will be and ‘I do’, when we say he needs to try hard and study more (he thinks doing the little he does right now is enough)

I rang him today and told him if he’s struggling or can’t do anything he can ring me and I will try to help but he just gets frustrated and angry at people when they try talk to him about it and he has very bad reactions to not being able to do stuff (getting angry and even crying just for not being able to do one piece of homework)

His school have not been giving him the support he needs and have basically lied up until these reports and said he is a star student rather than telling our parents that he isn’t doing well enough (which meant we couldn’t do anything about it)

I really wanna help him but he doesn’t understand that he needs help and that things are gonna be much much more difficult than he thinks

Tl;dr my brother wants to do a really hard course but he doesn’t know that he is already underachieving and how difficult it will be "
"How do I [25F] tell former owners of my home [30s F&amp;M] to forward their mail?


I’m not sure how to politely approach this situation, and I’d really appreciate some advice.

I purchased a home just over a month ago. The former owners moved to another home in the same neighborhood. Since then, I have been receiving their mail every day. I text them once every few days to let them know that I left their stuff in the mailbox and they can come pick it up, which they do. 

A week or two into this, the wife (who is the one I text) apologized and said that they were working on changing their address. I told her it wasn’t a problem (which it wasn’t at the time) and I understood. 

However, more than a month after they’ve moved out, the bulk of their mail still comes here. It’s starting to get annoying to have to sort through the mail to see what’s mine and let them know to come pick it up. 

I set up mail forwarding for my old address with USPS, it only cost $1 and works wonderfully. I’d like to suggest they do the same. They’re very friendly with their old neighbors (our new neighbors) so I’d really rather not offend them. Any suggestions for how I can approach it?

Thank you!

TL;DR the people I bought my home from a month ago still have mail coming here, how to I politely tell them to set up mail forwarding?"

tl;dr I lost a friend, actually almost all my friends even the one that were with me for more than 10. and i miss him. 

years, but this one..... 
i knew him from high school, he a was a lonely kid no one with him and everybody was mean to him and didn’t like him because he was new. except me. One day we had do find a partner for a school project, he immediately choose me, and thats how our friendship started. I lost a few friends because of me being his friend, most of them hated him because he was polite. One of the summers i spent all of it with him, i never done that even with people that i knew for years. Two semesters after that some of them decided to come back and we all get along with each other, we even found new friends that we used to play football with. These “ new “ friends, he hated them( me also) because they bully him, but we couldn’t say no because we liked playing football. However, just in a sudden he started liking them and my old friends, and slowly he kind of hated me. We finished high school and i didn’t lose contact, i still talk with him until he started avoiding me and saying thins i never did, we always tell the truth to each other but this time when i asked him what’s wrong, he never replied. He started bulling me instead on a group chat with all of my friends except one of them which was also being bullied. 

Even though, it’s been almost 1 and a half year, and i still miss spending time with him... i think i will never find a friend like him never in my life again. "

"I (26M) am worried about my friend's (32F) drinking, how it affects her health, and how her husband (35M) enables her


My friend of about 3 years has had a drinking problem for as long as I've known her. Earlier this year, she went to a rehab on her own volition, and I was really proud of her, but didn't think that it would be long before she would be back to her own habits, and maybe about a month or so later, she started drinking again.

Ever since she's gotten out of rehab she's been super evasive, not really wanting to hang out much, barely leaving the house, and when we do communicate she's pretty down, and either doesn't herself understand why, or doesn't really feel like explaining why she feels so down.

Her husband, who she's been dating/married to for 15 years, I feel exacerbates the situation, as he's still keeping alcohol in the house, and isn't shy of drinking around his wife. There are also a handful of other situations where I genuinely feel that their relationship is genuinely toxic. I don't know how much of their marriage is really valid for me to post online, and I don't know if it's my place at all to air any of their dirty laundry, even if it is anonymous, but suffice it to say, that I don't personally see her getting any better if she keeps him around, but at the same time I also see that her entire world revolves around him. Perhaps, depending on what facts reddit might find valuable, I could try to elaborate once I get a few responses.

As of yesterday, she was in the ICU, and apparently had fluid removed from her abomen, and as I type this, I just received word from her husband that it was indeed a liver related thing. I don't mean to be dramatic, but it feels like there's a good chance that I'll have to go to my friend's funeral much sooner than I would like to.

I'm not quite sure how to approach the subject to her that she needs more help, OR that I think that she would have a better chance of recovery without her man. This is compounded by the fact that we haven't really seen eachother too much since she got out of rehab, sometimes we'll have more luck with a surprise visit, and it might be a bit of a shock to just bring this up out of the blue to her, but I don't feel a good friend will sit by passively and let this happen.

I know this situation is not unique for people with an alcohol dependency, but I'm not sure what to do, hence fielding the internet for opinions and advice, hoping someone else out there has dealt with something similar to this, who might have the experience to help me handle this in an educated way.

"My boyfriend [27M] told me [27F] that I’m physically not his type, and now I’m extremely self conscious


My boyfriend [27M] told me [27F] that I’m physically not
Title basically says it... I’m not an unattractive person. My boyfriend and I have been together for a few months now. I’m in decent physical shape, I take care of myself. But last night my bf told me that generally his preference is for short, petite women, and that I am not. I’m taller than average (and he actually told me when we first met I was taller than he thought), and while I am a very healthy weight (BMI=22), I am definitely not petite. I am really curvy, and have broad shoulders and strong legs from basically a lifetime of sports and lifting.
Is this going to be a problem..? He tells me frequently that he thinks I’m beautiful, but now I feel like he might be settling.. will this become an issue for him later on?

TL;DR

My boyfriend admitted to preferring short petite women, and I am not that. Is he settling for me? Will this become a problem later on?"
"I [M16] have feelings for one of my closest friends [F17], who is sending some really mixed signals, does she like me?


Alright so me [M16] and E [F17] have been known each other for around 2 and half years. About a year ago, I was head over heels for this girl, she figured it out, said to one of our mutual friends, “I don’t want to ruin our friendship and I hope he finds someone good for him.”  

I figured that we would slowly drift away as most friendships do after one person has feelings and the other does not.

But we didn’t.

Over the past year, we’ve done the polar opposite - growing even closer to the point where we act more like a couple than just friends.

We flirt more than an actual couple, as confirmed by everyone who has seen us. We tell each other how much we love and appreciate each other somewhat often. We call each other ‘love.’ We took a four-week break from each other like a couple would do. Everybody who sees us either thinks we are a couple or thinks we should be a couple.

But problem lies with E’s personality.

You see she’s a natural flirt, she craves attention and she’s somewhat touchy with everyone. She is very attractive and she gets a lot of attention from guys. Thus, I have had a problem decipher what is her showing romantic interest and what isn’t. 

And it’s caused some stress for me.

So, because I knew how she felt about me and wanted to finally move on from her, I teamed up with another girl, J, [F18] who is also working on moving on and the first thing was to just not give them as much attention.

And so I did. I withdrew a little bit, just a little bit,  I started hanging out with other people, notably J and M [F18], who I am close with and she noticed.

For the past three weeks, she’s been asking me, “Why don’t you like me anymore, Why don’t you talk to me anymore” and she’s been complaining to other people “I just feel like he’s hanging out with other people and not giving me enough attention.”

Now, I think the part of the reason why she freaked out was because I am sort of known to just not talk to her when I’m mad at her, so she thought that I was mad at her for something.

And it’s escalated so much throughout the past three weeks. 

She’s interrupted conversations with me and J and she really turned up the heat in terms of flirting and touchiness (which could have been an appeal to my own touchiness, because I am very touchy). 

So I asked her about it.

“Why are you mad?”
“What do you mean, when was I mad?”
“Like for the past three weeks.”
“Oh, I was just worried that we were drifting away because you were hanging out with M and J a lot. And that’s fine, it just means we’ll talk a little less. But I’m not mad.”
*looks at E with expression of “are you sure”*
“I’m fine, it would be insane if I was mad at you for hanging out with them. I’m really not mad.”
She seemed fine about it, but if she was, why was she acting like that?

And so here we are. Does she like me?

I am planning on telling her that I have feelings on Sunday anyways, because it’s a win-win. Either she reciprocates feelings or I can get some closure and finally move on.

TL;DR

I am best friends with E [F17], who friendzoned me a year ago, and I have had on and off feelings for her ever since. However, in the past year we’ve grown to act more like a couple than just friends and everyone knows it.

I recently distanced myself just a little bit to help myself get over my feelings for her, so I started hanging out with different people and girls, and E got very jealous. I confronted her about it and she said “I’m not mad, it would be insane for me to be mad at you for hanging out with other people”

Does she like me?"

"My [18M] girlfriend's [18F] mother is abusive and I'm not sure what to do


We’ve been dating four months, so I haven’t know her for too long, but I’ve known her long enough to know that her mom does not treat her well. One of the best examples is she has been tracking my girlfriend’s (let’s call her Abby) location ever since Abby got a phone, and she is STILL TRACKING her in college. Once she slept over at my dorm, and her mom called her in the morning, and Abby had a full on panic attack. When Abby didn’t answer the first time, her mom just kept calling while Abby was sobbing into my arms. Abby has casually told me stories about her mom screaming at her since kindergarten about doing well in school, and I’ve texts of her calling Abby a spoiled brat, ungrateful, a bitch, etc. I’ve tried gently bringing it up, and she knows it’s not right, but that’s as far as we’ve got. I once implied her mom was a bad mother, and she got mad at me, saying she’s a great mother. Abby’s in counseling/therapy for anxiety (which she has because of her mom), but she says she doesn’t really like it and that it’s not doing anything. I don’t know what else to do at this point.

**Tl;dr: My girlfriends mom is abusive, talking about it doesn’t help, and it’s not getting better.**"
"Break up advice needed. Betrayal post break up makes me think there was betrayal during? Ex acts single and has led me on. Struggling to clear my mind (28F)


TL;DR: Ex and I have different approaches to break ups and I’ve hung onto his sporadic contact for a couple of years because I was hurt/missing him. Recently found out he’s been seeing someone for 1.5 years and has been inappropriate with me in this time (emotionally, not physically). Looking for advice to move on. 

This is long-ish: 
I can’t believe this relationship was two years ago now but I need some advice related to something that I’ve found out. 


I was with someone for nearly a year who was my strongest connection to date and my only ‘normal’ relationship (I’m 28F) where we spoke every day, met families etc. Commitment issues came out gradually (he said we were ‘in a relationship’ but had a reluctance to call me his ‘girlfriend’) and we ended before our year anniversary because he said he didn’t feel as excited as I seemed and that he felt I was moving quicker than him. I was quite patient to be honest, wasn’t forcing anything, but perhaps he just realised I was in quite deep and he wasn’t. To say the next three months of my life were the worst of my life is an understatement. However I got back on track and a week away gave me new perspective, until he ruined my birthday by turning up with roses but not wanting to reconcile. I was left very confused and looking back I seemed to hang onto this as some proof that he still had strong feelings for me. I find it hard to focus on all the things he wouldn’t do for me (commit, go on holidays etc).


In the year after our break up I did not contact him. He would message me things that were inside jokes or sometimes tell me he missed me. Around this time last year he started a long (text) conversation about us, did I still think I was happy with him, that he missed me, that he didn’t like we had become a dormant thing we’d never experience again, that he’d not had anything serious since. I was still missing him (but didn’t say so) and again was left hurt and confused that he seemed to still miss me but had no interest in reconciling. I found some peace in that he hadn’t moved on (or so I thought) and that I would be the one who got away. Deep down I would sometimes fantasise about us being back together, an unhealthy habit that went on for a long time. 


We ended that conversation with me saying that he needs to stop bringing up us as he made his decision and I think it was the right one for us (I don’t want to be with someone who doesn’t adore me) and can he stop messaging me. I said some things about how he may not see it yet, but this is selfish and I need space. He said he hates saying goodbye to me and then text me two days later late at night saying ‘there are words that need to be said after your last message, I just haven’t said them’.   I hate that I was eager to hear what these words were but I never got them. I didn’t hear from him again until I decided to reach out sometime later. 


I had a short relationship during this time that was pretty terrible. When it ended I was dwelling on what my ex had said to me and built up resentment that he can’t just close the door when I was trying to. Our approaches after a break up are clearly very different, but I was very hurt so can’t do the friends thing. 


I contacted him this summer because I wasn’t in a very good place and wanted to explain to him that I thought it was out of order he said that and didn’t follow up (6 months later, I know cringe). He said he had spoken to someone else about it and they told him to leave me alone. He was on holiday with friends when I called and we had a quick life catch up, he mentioned no girlfriend and didn’t say he missed me, but continued to text me and send videos of him on holiday when a song we used to listen to was playing. I got annoyed and tired of it after a couple of days and blocked him for 3 months. He always messages me on my birthday and I didn’t want to hear from him. I feel like this seems cold but I was tired of it. 


Fast forward to now and I’ve found out last night that he’s been seeing / with someone since at least May 2017.  They were on holiday then so probably from some time before that. They seem to have been on 6/7 holidays which upsets me because he didn’t want to go away with me. This wasn’t an insignificant relationship (or maybe it was?!) as we spoke each other day, even spoke about holidays, met families, the standard stuff. I’m so confused that he had the deep chat I described previously with me whilst seemingly in a more serious relationship (remember he also told me he hadn’t had anything like me).  Who knows what would have happened if I had suggested meeting up. 


I obviously am trying to focus on the fact I’ve seen his true colours. I can’t stand liars (even if it’s by omission). I’m all about openness and honesty, but I can’t help feeling sad due to the betrayal. It’s strange because I only know about betrayal after we ended, however there was another girl knocking about before we got together and after we ended (the same girl) so I always wondered if he entertained her when we were together (most likely). 


I’d appreciate any advice on how to move past this. I know I’ve got into a negative spiral with my thought processes but I really want to break out of this and move on. 

How do I focus on this horrible selfish parts of him? I don’t want to be with a cheater (even if just emotional) so why do I still feel sad? 

How do I stop fantasising about making him jealous?’

How do I make myself emotionally available again?


Thanks in advance. I need any help I can get at the moment. Feeling completely pathetic that these are things that happened a year ago but I’m stuck in a rut mentally.

"I [19M] broke off a budding relationship with my best friend [19F] and I think I made a mistake.


TL;DR Girl and I hook up for a while, it ends because she doesn't want a relationship. Later, we are best friends and she wants a relationship. We try for a little bit but I ended it out of fear of being hurt by her again. Later, I realize that I made a mistake and don't know what to do to get her back.

Last October I started to become close to a girl who lived in my college dorm. We became friends and eventually started hooking up. She was clear about the fact that she wasn't looking for a relationship as she had just gotten out of a relationship from high school and didn't want to commit to something serious again. I said that's ok and we hooked up semi regularly until the end of the year. During that time, we became extremely close. Due to a past relationship in high school I had developed a pretty serious fear of vulnerability but with her it melted away. We would talk for hours into the night and I loved how being with her made me feel. At the very end of the year I expressed to her that I was falling for her. She reiterated that she didn't want to commit to anything serious and that a relationship between us would probably never happen. 

Summer comes, and I feel crushed. I felt like I had trusted her with something very precious to me (my vulnerability) and she had tossed me aside. Now of course, this wasn't her fault, as the entire time she was very clear that she wasn't looking for a relationship, however it still took me a good chunk of the summer to come out of this rut of feeling very pathetic and small. This mostly had to do with past insecurities but part of me was upset with her. I message her that maybe it isn't a good idea for us to continue hooking up as we don’t seem to be on the same page and we decided that we should try to be just friends. 

School starts back up and after like a month, we are best friends. There is still some obvious romantic tension (she has since confirmed that it was mutual) but we stay ""just friends"". We were as close as we've ever been, telling each other ""I love you"" all the time, saying how happy we are that we're friends, all that good stuff. Then, about three months into the year (some of the best three months of my life) she tells me that she has feelings for me and wants to try again. My first reaction was frustration as I had spent the whole summer trying to get over her but after spending some time talking about it. We decided to give it another shot. About two weeks goes by and everything seems to be going well but I have some residual underlying fear of being hurt again and it kept me from being very excited about the prospect of a relationship with my best friend. She notices this and while we're on a date asks me how I'm feeling about everything. I expressed what I was feeling and the conversation took a turn and it seemed like the natural conclusion was that that maybe this relationship wasn’t the right thing for me at the time. However, in the back of my head I still held on to the assumption that we would probably end up dating eventually and I told her this. She was crushed that I didn't want to continue and I felt terrible at how much I'd hurt someone who I love but I tried to focus on myself and get on with my life. 

So we go back to being friends. But not really. We were friends but it was very clear that there was still a romantic connection and a lot of emotional intimacy. About a week after breaking it off we got pretty drunk together and it ended with us cuddling and talking for hours. I still carried the assumption that we will probably end up together at some point (an arrogant and selfish way to think) in the back of my head but that I should try to move on for the time being. A few weeks go by and during them I end up drunkenly making out with 2 different girls who I felt almost nothing for but decided why not. The whole time I was with them however, I couldn’t stop thinking about the girl and wishing it were her. Then, a friend told me that the girl was upset at me for assuming that she would ""wait for me"" and for saying that we would probably end up together eventually because that's emotionally manipulative and not how feelings work. I completely agree and realize that I fucked up big time. I realize that I am actually in love with this girl but have been so caught up in the assumption that we would end up together that I completely neglected her feelings. I realize that if I don't stop letting my fear and insecurity drive my actions with her then I might lose a shot at what I think (and she thought) would be an amazing relationship. 

I express all of this to her and say I want to try again. She is very frustrated however (rightly so), since I was so selfish and inconsiderate to how she was feeling. She had also been told about some of my actions and was upset (again, rightly so) that in the meantime I had made out with 2 other people. I wrote her a long letter expressing how sorry I am and how I'm willing to commit and stop letting my insecurity drive my actions but she is still very upset with me. We had a long talk where she said that she ""doesn't want to give me the satisfaction of being with her again since I don't deserve it and she doesn't want to give up her self respect by trying again with me."" I tell her that I completely understand where she's coming from, I fucked up big time, and I hope she can forgive me so we can try at something great. She said she needs some time to think about everything and I say ok. Also, I think its important to mention that some of her friends who don't know me are telling her that I don't deserve her, don't get back with me, I had my chance, etc.

What should I do? I think I made one of the biggest mistakes of my life by ending it with this girl and now it seems like the consequences might be that the door of romantic relationship with her closes for good. I can’t image what “just friendship” with her would look like. I don’t know if it’s even possible. But she has been one of my best friends (with a lot of romantic feelings also) for the past 6 months and don’t want to lose her presence in my life. "

I’m not sure what to do with this relationship. 
We’ve been dating for almost a year. Sometimes he’ll say things like we should send Christmas cards, or when will you be able to move (log distance 2 hours away). Last night I was talking about vulnerabitly and potential for relationship to progress or to see where it goes. i told him that I would like to continue to work on and build the relationship because you don’t know where it could go. He said something to the effect of: or it could end/not go anywhere. I was like sure, but relationships are necessary part of life. That kind of hurt. But then he said I satisfy him the way that no other woman has... whatever that means. I feel like I’m getting mixed signals after a year. Any insight, anyone? "
"My boyfriend broke my trust and I don't know what to do


My boyfriend and I have been going out for about a year now and we have had a really great relationship so far. A few  days ago ago I found out that he had been texting another girl that he has never met before. I saw a text pop up on his phone while he was out of the room, I wouldn't normally snoop but I decided to read it. He had been talking with this girl quite a lot and asked several times if she wanted to hang out together with the last being him asking her if she wanted to come over for drinks and to smoke weed and watch a movie, just the two of them. He does have friends that are girls but I know who they are and he never hangs out with any of them outside of work and rarely ever texts them. I confronted him about it and he felt really awful saying that he didn't know why he did it and nothing was going to happen. I asked him how he even knew this girl and he said that they had never even met but had a few mutual friends. He had found her on instagram and direct messaged her saying how he thought her style was really cool and later on gave her his number and they started chatting over text. The girl was really pretty and i'm sure that any straight guy would be attracted to her so that made me feel even worse. He asked her to dinner multiple times and eventually asked her to come over. None of the plans ever went through and he kept insisting to me that nothing was going to happen and he wasn't actually going to go through with any of it. When I asked why he did it he, he said he didn't really know and that it was probably to give him an ego boost. I have always been so loving and caring towards him and never would have expected him to do anything like this to me. Its hard for me to believe him when he said nothing was going to happen because it seems like the intention was still there. I feel really conflicted and hurt because we had such a great relationship and then he went and betrayed any trust I had in him. He has never done anything like this before and has always been completely committed to me and never gave me any reason not to trust him before this incident. He has been saying that he's so sorry he did this to me and that he wasn't thinking, worst mistake ever etc. I don't know what to do because I love him so much but it also feels so unfair that he's done this to me, we also are taking a trip away together over Christmas break that I have been looking forward to for a long time so I'm even more confused and I don't know what to do. I really don't want to break up because I didn't see any of this coming but I also feel hurt and angry that he would be so stupid."
"I (mid20sF) and (30sM) were working on getting back together when I brought up his relationship with his sister. He refuses to talk about it at all but I can't get over how inappropriate it is. Is this possible incest?


Just like the title states, I believe my possible? XBF's relationship with his sister is weird. Let's call them Joe and Sue. So when Joe and I got together, I knew from the start he and his sister were very close. He talked about it all the time, besides they were always posting stuff to each other on social media. I think that's awesome. Anyway, turns out Sue lived with Joe for a short time while she was going to college. Not too weird, pretty nice of him to give her a place to stay. Before and after Sue had lived with him they always made a point to see each other often. That's really cool. They have kept in touch over the phone when they aren't able to meet up for long periods of time. Also cool.

What I find a little off, is when they have frequently visited each other over the years, they often stay in, stay up all hours of the night, getting high, drunk, whatever together, alone, with only one bed to sleep in. Now when Sue would stay with Joe she would ""stay on the couch"", but I've seen Sue's house, and she doesn't have any furniture to sleep on besides her bed, so I'm a little unclear as to where Joe sleeps when he goes there. I only know all of this because Joe has told me this. He says he sleeps on the floor btw. They also go to concerts and such alone together, and she has made mention that she plans on taking a trip soon to the city known for sex and gambling, and who does she want to go with her? You guessed it.

Other kind of off things I noticed when we first got together was that he had a nickname for her. Now this nickname is immediately taken as a sexual innuendo to me, I really don't see any other way it could be applied to somebody, but Joe swears it's innocent. Whatever, Ok. So we start dating, I notice he is on the phone with her a lot. I notice when we have problems in our relationship she knows all about it. Sometimes he doesn't even talk to me about it and she has to step in. So this pisses me off, we discuss it, move on, whatever.

So I take a trip, she's immediately at Joe's house. I find it a little ironic but whatever, she stays a couple days, they get drunk and stay up all night, she leaves. I come home. She comes over a couple times while I'm there, they act a little secretive. They're always finding an excuse to leave the room, or stay up all night, or whispering when I come into the room. I blow it off, whatever. It gets weirder, I notice Joe never stays up late unless Sue is around, and I try to stay up with them but always end up passing out before they do. I begin to make a point to stay up until everybody crashes, but they actually start Encouraging me to go to bed. They tell me they're going to stay up a little longer together. It gets to the point I practically have to beg Joe to come to bed with me at insane hours of the night, this is starting to get weird...

One night I pass out early and I wake up when Joe comes to bed right as the sun is coming up. I woke up again to him leaving the bed a few hours later. I wake up to him coming back to bed at noon pretending to have just woken up. When confronted he acted kind of surprised that I even woke up and just said he had gotten up to play video games. I find this really weird because Joe loves his sleep. He's usually the first one to pass out and sleeps til noon when he's been drinking. Whatever, I don't have an explanation for his behavior at this point.

Ok, one weird instance, Sue lives like two hours away right? Well one night Joe says he needs to go to the store even though he had literally just got home from there. He says he forgot something. Ok, whatever. He's gone for an HOUR AND A HALF, to a store less than five minutes away. He doesn't answer his phone like usual, no texts, idk where he's at but supper is cold at this point. He gets home and I ask him what took so long. He says oh he ran into SUE at the store and talked to her for a minute. He says he forgot she was coming to town and they happened to run into each other. I said you sat in the store parking lot for AN HOUR AND A HALF?? And he said yeah I guess I did. It gets weirder...

So Joe and Sue's family member gets put in the hospital. Joe and I decide to go see them, while there Sue decides to tag along. Cool. But I literally got turned into a chaperone, after leaving the hospital Joe wanted to go shopping, and every store we went into Joe and Sue would literally disappear together. I literally wondered around like three different stores that day by myself for an hour or so at a time. WTF. I am irritated but keep my focus on consoling Joe and blow it off. We go back to Sue's house and make plans to stay at a family members house. Like I said Sue doesn't have an extra bedroom or bed, and they had a family member close by who did. Keep in mind this is my first time meeting Joe's extended family. Anyway it get's late into the night and we're still at Sue's. I'm getting a little irritated because we had only seen the family member in the hospital for maybe half an hour and had spent the day with Sue and now half the night, I was tired and ready for bed. They've also been acting weird as hell all night. They'd be whispering every time I left the room, Joe would go smoke if I entered the room and if I went to join him he would immediately rejoin Sue in the house. It was weird and he was clearly avoiding me.

As it continues getting later I begin to bring up how we should be getting to bed so we can see said family member in the morning. Joe and Sue keep making bs excuses to stay up late like they always do, they tell me to go ahead and head over to the other house and get some sleep. Idk why, but I just knew if I did Joe wasn't going to be joining me. It was honestly overwhelming how desperate he was to be with her alone. He even began telling me later he needed time alone with her and I needed to go ahead to the house to sleep. I started getting short with him, as I did not want to confront him in front of Sue, but I literally couldn't even get him to leave her side so I could talk to him. I eventually got pissed off and said I was running to the gas station. As soon as I shut the door behind me I could clearly hear him go, ""what the fuck is her problem?"" So I run to the gas station and come back ready to confront him, and much to my surprise as soon as I open the door him and his sister are rushing out of her bedroom. We get into a fight and he still refuses to go to bed. He literally grabs a pillow and lays on the floor of his sister's house, when we had a room and bed to sleep in. Like WTF. Later on when I asked him what they were doing in her bedroom he says they were just looking at a painting. I don't understand why they'd need to rush out if that's all they were doing.

I just think this sneaky behavior and need to be alone all the time is weird. They also stay together on the holidays for the most part. Another weird thing is she recently got a bf, and Joe didn't stay with her over Thanksgiving like they usually do. I've also noticed they leave family gatherings often to go drink or whatever, but alone. But to the point, we broke up awhile ago, and lo and behold guess who was at his house almost immediately? Yup. Anyway we were recently somewhat working through things when this got brought up. He always refused to see my side of things throughout the relationship so this was just an issue that needed to be worked through anyway. When I brought it up he immediately said we were through and hung up the phone. He refuses to talk about it and just calls me delusional and asks who else thinks that. Something else weird is that he was with a girl for a few years that he ended up finding out was sleeping with her brother, so you'd think he wouldn't want people to think that about his sister, but it's just weird. There's probably more, but anyway reddit, is Joe fuckin' Sue??

Also thought I'd add, they are pretty flirty with each other despite all this other weird stuff. They're constantly joking, tickling/poking each other, making inside jokes, they each have a nerf gun and have wars when they visit each other. It just seems a lot more flirty than normal. They also aren't afraid to talk about more intimate subjects with each other,

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR

So basically he has a nickname for her that sounds like a sexual innuendo, they sneak around and need a lot of alone time when around other people, specifically when it's just the three of us, I've caught them rushing out of her bedroom before after being left alone together for a short period of time, and anytime they aren't dating anyone or their significant others are out of town they are immediately together, stuck to each other's sides.

We're both homebodies so it just coincidentally happened that we were home more together more often than the others. I've met a lot of her friends and she's very affectionate with everyone. She's the type to hold hands with her girl friends and sit with an arm around someone's shoulder/leaning on their shoulder/etc. 

She's a bit more withdrawn with the roommates because we just don't know each other as well but lately, she's started giving me hugs occasionally. I feel like I'm starting to like her. Obviously this would be a bad idea as we have to live together until May but it's hard to hold back my own feelings when I feel like she's flirting with me.

My boyfriend and i have been together for over almost 5 months. On my end everything has been great but yesterday while out with him we ran into one of his ex’s. I know this is his ex because he’s showed me a phot of her before and after leaving the store i remembered who she was.


So at first it seemed like he wanted to avoid her. They eventually crossed paths and he said “hey” and she said hey and he went back to shop. My boyfriend and i had separate things to get so we were grocery shopping separately. She went down an aisle he was on and she started talking to him.. They started talking so i continued to do my shopping while they were talking. After a couple of minutes i glance over towards them and he started teasing her a little. My boyfriends ex was pushing her basket and he would grab the end of her basket then releases it and start laughing.



I went to the aisle nearest them and he was bringing up their old memories and their little inside jokes. He then told her randomly “you need a longer T-shirt “ she said “ why is there something on my butt?, is my underwear showing or something” she starts looking down. and he said “na“ and started smiling while kind of signaling to her butt size/they was her butt looked in the pants she had on. (he didn’t directly say her butt size/shape but i could see where he was going with what he was saying) He asked her about some job she had applied for and what was the status on it.


And basically they were joking on each other the entire time we were there. He asked her about her glasses and she said she wears contacts now and he said “oh you’re just trying to show off that face”. The whole time we were in the store he would randomly say things out of the ordinary to her to get her attention or say her name and just say something completely random that he could’ve kept to hisself. And right as she was leaving the store he walked behind her grabbed on her hair and yanked on it. Is he just being friendly?


TL:DR; my boyfriend didn’t have the decent to respect me while i was there and I’m not sure how to go about the conversation"

"My (f19) coworker (f42) has been making rude/ demeaning comments towards me at work.


So, I want to start off by saying that I could absolutely be reading into this, but it feels like she's targeting me in what she's saying/ doing.

The other day at work she made a comment when I said I shared her sons birthday that she was wondering if I was the baby of the woman next to her who was crying because she had an ugly baby.

In those words, basically.  

I wasn't born in the same city, but this seemed like something extremely rude to bring up to someone. Even if that were the case, which at the time it seemed like a very made up story that she played off to insult me.

It didn't start at this level though, she has made small comments throughout her time of working with me towards me, but doesn't towards anyone else.

When I speak she seems disinterested and it almost feels like she's competing with me because after I say something she'll come up with something that is like one-upping what I just said, or a direct insult about it.

I carve quartz pipes for fun among other things (I'm not a crystal fanatic, but I find lapidary fun) and my boss was asking me about it. When my coworker in mention heard she made a face and said that it wasn't art as he was talking about how I did that. It was small, but seemed a bit rude to say in front of me.

Another time I was talking about an encounter I had with an older man at a casino who had been offering me money to gamble, etc. buying me drinks and trying to get me to go back to his yacht. It was a crazy thing that happened, and I was talking about it mostly to my other coworker. Right after this she said that she wouldn't want to raise a girl who would have a sugar daddy/ get paid by an older man. Even though I didn't do anything on my end (as I accepted no money), I felt shamed by her and it seemed like this comment was directed towards me. Basically for being approached by him without asking/ doing anything.

The list goes on, but the thing she said the other day was the most (at least in my opinion) directly rude thing she has said. She said it out loud in front of my coworkers and I'm now feeling like this will, or at least could escalate from here.

TLDR; I feel like my coworker is making rude remarks and demeaning me at work and it's causing me anxiety even though I like my job, what should I do?"
"How to stop having angry, hateful and defensive thoughts after an acquaintance (38/f) talked shit about me (28/f)? I don't like being a person who has these thoughts.


I am in a group of people who all plays a sport. One of the very common problems in this sport is that people are always trying to play ""up."" Like they are trying to play with people who are a higher level than they are, so they can think of themselves as being a high level too and above others. I've played this sport in several different states and it's been an issue anywhere I've played.

I have had some issues where certain people, who are NOT higher level than me, have blatantly excluded me and mocked me due to these issues of wanting to ""play up"" instead of playing with me. So I'm a bit sensitive and self-conscious about people not wanting to play with me or thinking that I'm bad.

By any objective measure, by anything that can be counted, I'm in the upper half of players of this group, not that high but basically in the middle.

So, recently, there was some drama when ""Phyllis"" (38/f) wanted to bring her daughter. I haven't had any problems with Phyllis although she is the most notorious for trying to ""play up,"" she's always trying to make friends with people WAY higher level than her, and get them to play with her so that she can participate in high level competitions and brag about that. Phyllis is probably one of the most insecure people around, she's insecure about all areas of her life not just this sport.

But I've never had a problem with her because when we do happen to get put together to play, she has never been mean to me or bullied me, rolled her eyes and yelled at me as certain individuals have done.

Well, Phyllis told the group leader that she wanted to bring her daughter to play with our group. Her daughter cannot play. She can do like a few basic things, but she is not competent at the fundamentals of the game and she could not even fully play a low level game.

The group leader, Kate, nicely said that the daughter wasn't ready yet because she wouldn't be able to play at the level of the group at all, and she should practice more before coming.

Phyllis absolutely wigged out on Kate, and told Kate that she was a mean and hateful person, and that she didn't know what she had ever done to Kate to cause Kate to be so vicious to her. Very disproportionate reaction. And then, Phyllis listed out a number of people she said are worse players than her daughter, as her reason why her daughter should play.

I happen to be friends with Kate and I didn't know any of this until Kate told me about it. The reason why Kate told me was that she was upset. Phyllis had really hurt Kate's feelings when she accused her of being mean and vicious. So I was comforting Kate and telling her that she was not mean and what she told Phyllis made sense.

And then, I don't know why, Kate told me that I was the first name Phyllis listed as someone who was a worse player than her daughter. Kate shared the text messages with me and I was first on a list of about 1/4 of the group.

When I found out about this, I felt very hurt, embarrassed, ashamed and angry. I kept having angry and hateful thoughts towards Phyllis. My mind keeps coming back to how I want to challenge Phyllis and her daughter to play 2 vs. 2 against me and someone else from her list. Because to be really honest, both Phyllis and her daughter would be crying at the end of that game.

Also, this is worse, but I find myself thinking bigoted thoughts. Everyone who has verbally bullied me in this group comes from a certain nationality. And this nationality is very notorious for talking their own language in front of people who don't understand, and saying horrible things about people right in front of their face. It's a cliche that this nationality does that. Phyllis belongs to this nationality as well so I find myself thinking things like ""These XYZ-ians are so fake and two faced, and they are so catty and nasty, I don't want to be around them.""

I feel sensitive and hurt about what Phyllis said because of my experiences being excluded, made fun of and treated like I suck, when I'm really not that bad and definitely not worse than most people.

But I really hate being that person to have hateful and vindictive thoughts about someone else. I very rarely feel that way and I don't like it, that's not who I want to be.

Any suggestions for getting rid of these thoughts? I feel pissed off any time I see Phyllis and I think about how fake nice she acts to my face while she said something like that behind my back.

tl;dr: How to stop having angry, hateful and defensive thoughts after an acquaintance (38/f) talked shit about me (28/f)? I don't like being a person who has these thoughts."
"Am I (25m) In an Abusive Relationship With My Girlfriend (26f)


I have been dating someone for a year and a half. She is a wonderful person and I've never been so in love. The only problem is we are in different countries. Initially, we decided to work it out and set a time table where I bring her to my country once I finish my (second) degree in a health field, which is non-transferable. I graduate in a year.

She decided to look for new job opportunities and I supported her, but now, she tells me that if she finds a job she loves, she will not leave and I must go there and teach English. If she doesn't, she'll come here. She knows I love her too much to refuse.

On top of that, she acts cold whenever she's PMSing and treats me like crap because she is off the night shift now so we can't talk as much as before.

I feel helpless

TLDR; My girlfriend reserves the right to decide what country we live in despite me studying for a degree not applicable outside my country."

"Was in a relationship now friends with benefits... What to do?!?


So i'll start by saying that me and this girl, let's call her v, we were coworkers at first. She had a boyfriend at that time and we were friend and enjoyed each other's company at work. I even took her to another coworkers birthday party with me. She quits and months go by and she tells me that she is single. I took her out one night and we ended up hooking up. So we go on and end up dating each other and i think its going great. It's my first relationship i've had so I can't tell you from a different perspective how it really went. Ok now few months go by and she tells me that she doesn't see a future with me and tells me that she doesn't want a relationship. Naive and stupid me does not care and continue with the relationship. So I am basically dating this girl knowing that she doesn't see any future with me but i continue. She insist that she has so much fun with me and the sex is great. The thing is.. she basically ended things off that one night but we would somehow make up and it would seem like normal. Now here's where it go weird. I went on a trip with some friend to Miami and she gets angry at me and is sad that she wasn't able to go with me and since her job situation wasn't ideal at the moment, she felt like she was selfish that she would rather have me with her then having a good time spending money on a trip. When i came back we talked and i guess we continued our ""relationship"". A few weeks go by and she goes on a trip on her own. Actually it was a wedding which makes it even more skeptical. The thing is, when I went on my trip and came home I couldn't wait to talk and see this girl. When she comes back from the trip I didn't hear from her for a few days. We end up talking and she tells me that once again she doesn't see anything with me and decides she wants to be alone and doesn't want to be with me. I know, I know, she told me this from the jump but when she told me this I was heart broken and it destroyed me. We still talk to this day, a lot actually, and still have sex, often, but I know theres no future relationship in sight. I would love to be with this girl and i do think theres a chance but not now. I'm guessing we have a friend with benefits relationship since we don't talk as much as we used to, pay for our own stuff, go out with our own friends without each other, but we'll still accidentally call each other babe and there's still so much chemistry. She told me that I was a selfish person and that we're so different, so thats why we didn't work out. I've been trying so hard to cut her out of my life so I can move on but I always find an excuse just to talk or see her. Am I just being naive and immature for not moving on or is she the one confusing me? I would love to hear some different perspectives. 

&amp;#x200B;

Thanks everyone!! 

tl;dr Me and this girl dated for about 6/7 months and she ended things off but we are still only having sex with each other. I would love to have a relationship with her but she doesn't. Need some advice on moving on or to keep on trying."

Ive been seeing this girl for 2 months. Communcation was pretty difficult from the begining, seems like she was emotionally unavailable because of her past also seemed like she was making up stories to make her seem special but i decided to deal with it and ive been very relaxed about it, seen each other 5 times first month had sex, than it was difficult to meet up for few weeks so i kinda gave up. didnt try to talk to her for over 10 days, thought things were done, than she comes back willing to meet up anytime so i went with it(probably shouldnt lol) had a good time again. Than she was very responsive texting following week, made plans to hang agian, day of i sent a text if we still on, no response, and no contact since. What confussing me most why would she come back after avoiding meeting for over a month. Thoughts?

TL;DR: im super confused with a girl that im dealing with for past 2 months, im not sure how much more effort should i put into it at this point. I was pretty patient probably more than i would have been with any other women just because she has been through a lot in her life. "

"My mom (55) and I (21) hate each other


My mom is always being distant, cold, mean and intimidating. She hits me whenever she gets mad of frustrated. She often say she had to sacrifice her life in order to raise us, because we were extremely demanding  and that she ruined her life when she got married and had kids (even tho we had a nanny and a maid all or childhood). She is mean and often says that she hopes I lost my job in a research team at my university. I’m a honor roll med student, but she often yells me how stupid and probably retarded I’m. Since I was a kid she keeps telling me that I’m a slut if I wear a skirt or shorts. That I “party a lot” when I barely go out once a month.
Lately the worst part is about money. I have enough money to live alone, but I’m saving it because I’m planning to start a new life in another country when I finish my career in two years, and I really need to save as much as possible, so I pretend I make minimum wage when for real I think I make twice she does, so she gets super angry and yells me and make me cry whenever my siblings complain about not having all the fancy things they want, so I feel kinda bad about hiding my high income but I also feel like maintaining my siblings (all +18) when they could just get a job. My boyfriend lives alone and I sometimes think about moving with him to avoid being around my mom but then she would start saying and I’m a slut and I live in sin and spread how a shitty daughter I’m. 
Every time I talk to her, it will end up in a fight and in me crying. I don’t feel affection for her. Honestly when I was 16 I tried to kill myself because I thought her life would be less miserable if I was death. 
I don’t really know what to do. Mess up all my savings and move alone or just keep crying everyday"

"I [18M] am getting more and more uncomfortable with my girlfriend [17F] of one year alternative Instagram account.


Hey guys, throwaway for obvious reasons.

&amp;#x200B;

So to preface this let me say that I care deeply for my girlfriend, and this whole situation is deeply upsetting me. I don't know what to do, and I would like some help.

&amp;#x200B;

On Sunday my girlfriend told me she was going to reactivate her old Instagram account that she had when she was younger. All of her old online friends are there, and she wants to catch up with them. The only problem is, is that they are all guys. She had real life friends, but she spends so much time on her instagram and talking to her online guy friends and it makes me uncomfortable for a few reasons. One, all of her guy friends make sexual jokes non stop, and it hurts me and makes me jealous. I have brought it up to her but she says they are joking and it is no big deal. Ever since she opened it back up, she has been spending less time talking to me and more time talking to them. Right now she is talking to, at the very least 5 other guys that I don't know and have no way of knowing. Some of these guys even told her that they have feelings for her. But there is more to come.

&amp;#x200B;

Sunday night she also reconnected with her ex who she broke up with over a year ago. She was fond of their memories and missed him, which led her to cry because she missed him as a friend. (she hasnt talked to him in over a year, and he also lives in another state). She then told me that she wanted to play online games with him a few times a week, and i told her that made me very uncomfortable, but she got upset with me and said that I was being controlling. She insisted that she only likes him as a friend, and she still wants to be best friends with him because they were best friends before they dated and she misses him as a friend. Then on monday she told me she was in her feelings the night before and had not processed their break up because she never had the chance to as after they broke up she rebounded. And then after her rebound, her and I got together.

&amp;#x200B;

Ever since she reopened that account she has been talking to me less and less, and has been talking to her guy friends more and playing with them more than we get to talk. For exmaple her and  I played a game tonight, but because I stole her kill, she got upset and got off the game. Then she told me she wanted alone time, which I gave her. Then she texted me saying ""hey"" and I asked her if she wanted to facetime. Instead she asked if I would be ok with her playing videogames with her ex. I told her it was ok, even though I am very uncomfortable with it, because she is acting distant because we have been fighting a lot lately, and wishes we would fight less. She has even mentioned that she might want to take a break. 

Reddit I am at a loss, and I am scared. Am I being controlling? Am I being overly Jealous? Please be honest with your advice. I appreciate it.

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR: Gf opened up old instagram account where she talkes to a lot of her online friends, but she is talking to her guy friends more than me and they make sexual comments. She has also reconnected with her ex and they talk a lot too. Advice?"

"I [18/F] went skinny dipping with my coworkers [20s M&amp;F] while on a break from my bf [18/M]. Should I tell him?


I'm not sure if this is a big deal, but I don't know how he'd react if I told him. My bf and I were struggling over the summer and took a 3 week break from our relationship. During this time we didn't have any ground rules, but we stopped texting/talking and hanging out.

During this time, I went hiking with coworkers and ended up skinny dipping in a lake during our hike. It was very spontaneous and out of character for me. Should I tell my bf? He probably wouldn't believe me anyway. 

TL;DR: Went skinny dipping while on break from my bf. Should I tell him?"
"I [25F] got dumped by long term bf [24M] for writing mean journals. How do I get him back?


My ex \[24M\] broke up with me \[25F\] a week ish ago. The reason is because he found a huge stash of journals I keep hidden (we live together) where I write really, really mean things about him (saying hes not funny, i only like him for sex, hes annoying, i would rather be with other guys, stuff like that) I used to do this like every day but in the past few months I have hardly written anything. I realized I do it as a coping mechanism, out of fear that he is going to leave me or something. I've found its one of the only things that usually works to prevent my panic attacks. I struggle with depression, paranoia and bad OCD that i'm sure has a lot to do with this. He seems sympathetic but is scared of being with me because i'm unstable.

He keeps telling me he really loves me, misses me, and wishes he could take me back but he just doesn't understand how I could write such evil things when I seem like I love him so much. He told me he wants to wait 6 months, try to fall out of love with me, and if he still feels like he wants to be with me, he might take me back. He says (and I agree) that I need time alone to work out my intense fear of relationships that caused this. In that 6 months I plan on doing everything I can to heal myself so I can learn to accept love. He seems hopeful that we can one day be together. 

I want to meet up with him one last time before the 6 month no contact period, and explain myself more, tell him about all of my plans to get better, tell him how much I love him, basically like ""I know we can't be together right now but here are all the reasons I think you should consider taking me back eventually."" I feel like he might want me to because he keeps inviting me over but then changing his mind. I think he wants me to prove that I love him. He said we should probably hang out and talk about everything over Christmas break but I'm scared to wait that long because I feel like his friends (he told everyone) might convince him not to let me, or to hate me. He is kinda easy to convince of things, in general. Also scared that he might move on. We've been together for 4 years and lived together for 2.

Just wondering what you guys think the best way to go about this would be. I don't know if I should wait for him to come to me (he already has asked me to come over 3 times but I keep saying no) or if I should invite myself over... but my friends tell me I should avoid seeming too desperate....... Help please?

TL;DR boyfriend broke up with me because I write mean journal entries about him to cope with mental illness, would like advice on how to eventually get him back
