"UPDATE: My [27F] boyfriend's [27M] old crush returning after a few years away. I was worried he would leave me for her, sadly I was right.


Old post - https://old.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/4xgz9v/my_25f_boyfriend_25m_had_a_crush_on_a_girl_25f/

He ended up breaking up with me about a month after she came back and got back with her. It's been two years since this all happened and I heard through the grapevine they got engaged last weekend. I've moved on and it's alright, but my heart breaks when I think of how insecure and self-conscious I felt when all this went down. I know I'll eventually find a guy who I won't have any worries about, until then I'm chilling.

**TL;DR: I was right to be worried.**"
"UPDATE: How do I [26F] talk to my SO[21M] about needing him to keep my room tidy when he's staying over?

&amp;#x200B;

I thought I would update on what’s happened since my post one year ago.

&amp;#x200B;

Shortly after, I chose an appropriate time to talk to R about the situation. I explained how it makes me anxious to come back home to a messy place and would rather keep it tidy as I go, specially if It’s when leaving the house and I’m not late for any commitments.

&amp;#x200B;

I also brought up that I thought it would be good for him to live by himself before we could consider living together. I explained that I used to be very messy when I first moved out of my parents house but with time learned the value of a tidy and clean space in which to feel relaxed. He thought about it and a while after said he thought I was right and he would like to have a go at living by himself, saying he was very excited even thinking about it.

&amp;#x200B;

In the days after the talk his attitude changed completely too. At times I would leave for work and he would stay at my house to do some other chores or come and pick me up earlier and take the bins out. He started spending more time at my house after this and we became much closer in the following months.

&amp;#x200B;

In September R started a new job and for logistical reasons we could not spend the night together unless we were both on a day off the following day (he works Monday-Friday and I work 4 shifts on 4 off). We would go a whole week without seeing each other for more than an hour or two, which was really abnormal for us. We started to make a big effort to meet up at any spare 15 minutes between our jobs and other commitments. Sometimes one of us would drive to the other one after work just to say hi for 10 minutes and then leave. It really showed how much we cared about the relationship.

&amp;#x200B;

Around this time I was looking for a new house as i had a raise at my job and could afford to live somewhere on my own as opposed to a shared house. I went to see a flat that was perfect for me. Ticked all the boxes, including budget. The only thing was that as soon as I saw it all I could think of was how it wasn’t to be just mine but mine and R’s.

&amp;#x200B;

That evening we sat down and I told him about the flat and what I thought as soon as I saw it. I explained how the efforts we had both put in the relationship over the last few months proved to me that we had a relationship worth cherishing. He asked me for some time to think about it and eventually said he too thought we should move in together. R said he didn’t feel like he needed to live alone to “discover himself”. We then sat down and wrote a list of things we would look for in a place, including a budget and how much we would need to spend on furniture, etc. By this time I had decided to forget about the perfect flat I saw and we decided to look for another place together. A few weeks go by and the agency calls me to say the flat I had seen a month before was still available and the landlord had lowered the rent. We went to see it and R loved it as much as me.

&amp;#x200B;

Over the last 5 months he has surprised me everyday. He has taken this flat and looked after it in a responsible adult way. R has been busy fixing everything that needed TLC in the house, spent time decorating the garden, he even signed up for cooking lessons so he could be better at making meals for us. His parents come over often and still don't believe the change in him.

&amp;#x200B;

**We are two happy peas in a happy little flat.**

&amp;#x200B;

Thank you all for your advice.

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR: we talked, R respected my space, 5 months after the post we moved in, having the best time in our little beautiful flat."
"My [26F] sister in law [31F] always goes into my bedroom for no reason. How can I get her to stop?


Before anyone says anything, I know how stupid this sounds. But hear me out. 

I have my own home with her brother, and all three of our bedrooms and our only bathroom is upstairs. The only reason anyone has to be upstairs is to go to the toilet, or possibly to my daughter's room if their kid is playing there too. 

I've noticed whenever my SIL comes over, she just walks on through to our room, which I kinda feel like is an invasion of privacy. All the clean laundry comes to our room, and if we have visitors we tuck away a few things in our room so it's invariably the messiest room in the house and the one we least want people in. But no matter what she's always in there, and seemingly for no reason at all. It's usually to 'see my paint colour' (it hasn't been painted in over a year) or 'see the cat' or 'look out the front window'.

The worst was today - I came home from work early as I'm feeling ill. I knew she was coming over with her kids and my partner kindly said I could stay in bed and not worry about coming down to be sociable etc, especially with the kids over it's a lot when you have a headache. He said he just wasn't gonna mention I was home at all because the kids would come try and chat and play if they knew I was here.

So I'm listening to them play in the next room and SIL comes up to check on them and sees they are all fine. THEN SHE OPENS MY BEDROOM DOOR. I've stuck my head under the covers and she hovers then closes it again. Wtf?? Why is she always opening my bedroom door like what is she expecting to see? 

I just feel like because we're all adults it's an unspoken boundary, you don't just hit up someone's bedroom without having an invite to come see or a legit reason. 

Am I weird for thinking this is irritating and not being able to make any sense out of it? Also I know that everyone is going to suggest I just talk to her about it but how awkward is that? 'Yo I know you're in you're 30s now but please stay out of my room?'. I have tried in the past to hint that I hate having folk in there because that's where all my laundry goes for ironing and all the spare toys get stored to create extra play room. She don't give a shit. 

**TL;DR: SIL always enters my bedroom unasked and this is where I hide all my messy shit when people are over. How can I ask her without sounding weird and accusatory?**"
"My [28/F] husband [28/M] plays video games non stop and I’m starting to feel lonely in the relationship


My husband and I have only been married for 6 months but have been together for 5 years and living together for most of that time.
My husband loves to play PC games with his mates all the time. He works a 9-5 comes home plays games until he comes to bed in the early hours of the morning when I’ve already fallen asleep. On the weekends he plays all day. He doesn’t do many duties around the house and I try to give him one job to do (e.g. a round of washing) before getting on games but he usually doesn’t do it saying that he has to get on now because everyone else is on.
I can understand wanting to play games for enjoyment and to relax but I’m starting to feel really lonely. I feel like I hardly see him even though he’s in the house and he also never wants to talk about anything. Honestly the last proper conversation we had that I can recall was on Saturday and it’s now Thursday. I spend my weeknights and weekends alone watching Netflix, reading and cleaning.
I don’t know how to broach the subject of his gaming or if people think it’s not a serious problem? Every time I try he just has the argument “well your lucky I don’t spend my time out drinking”. I don’t know what to do please give me some advice.

TL;DR! My husband plays videos games non stop, I’m starting to feel lonely in the relationship. How do I broach the subject?"
"UPDATE: sister got anon message saying boyfriend was cheating


Original post here:

[https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/b6vl6c/my\_29f\_sister\_27f\_received\_an\_anonymous\_message/](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/b6vl6c/my_29f_sister_27f_received_an_anonymous_message/)

A few days ago, my (29F) sister (27F) got an anonymous message saying my boyfriend (35M) of 9 months was cheating on me with prostitutes he met through dating apps.

I confronted him earlier today when he got back from his trip.  I didn't know what to say so I just told him there was something we needed to talk about and showed him the screen capture my sister had sent me.  He got really, really, quiet and just sat there for a minute.  Then he pulled out his phone and handed it to me and told me I should look through it. He said I could see for myself that there were not dating apps on the phone, and I was welcome to read all his text messages and emails.  He seemed really sincere, so I decided not to look and just told him that I trusted him but wanted to let him know that this had happened, and then I asked if he had any idea who might do something like this, and he said he didn't. I told him as far as I was concerned, the matter was done.

We hung out for a little while, and he was pretty quiet, which I didn't think was that strange under the circumstances. Then he left because he had to run some errands.  A couple of hours later, he called me and said he had something he had to tell me.  He told me that about ten years ago he was really depressed and feeling bad about himself after a breakup and some bad dating experiences, and he visited prostitutes \~15 times over about a 4 year period.  The first time was during a trip abroad right after college in a country where it was legal, but the rest of the times was in the US.  He says that he always wore condoms and has been tested since then and the last time he visited a prostitute was about 8 years ago.  He swears he has never cheated on me with a prostitute or with anyone else.

I asked him why he didn't tell me this in person, and he said that he was shocked and didn't know what to say and that he barely thinks about it anymore. He said he was calling me over the phone now because he didn't know how I would react and thought maybe I wouldn't want to see him in person but he wanted to be honest. I told him this was a lot to process and I needed to hang up and think about it and talk to him later.

Now I'm freaking out and don't know what to do.  I had mostly talked myself into thinking it was a hoax even before he got back.  Then when he denied it, I believed him. But now I'm not so sure.  What are the odds?  I don't know what to do.

tl;dr: I confronted my boyfriend about anonymous message saying he's been visiting prostitutes. He denied cheating on me with prostitutes but admitted he has gone to prostitutes in the past."
"My (26/F) boyfriend (31/M) never pays for anything (meals, gifts, etc.) despite him making more than me.


I've been dating my bf for about 4 months. Whenever we go out to eat, my bf never offers to pay for me. We always either pay separately or I'll offer to pay for him and he'll happily accept. if we ever go on a double date at a restaurant or out with a group of friends drinking, my friends' bfs are always the ones paying for both of them. while my bf is just like ""split the check, right?""

I know he's not poor or experiencing any kind of financial problems; he makes more than me. It's not like I want him to pay for me all the time just every one in a while. But he'll never offer. also he won't pay for things when we're out and about. 

For example I really wanted this pair of super cheap goofy socks in a store and was like 'oh no this place has a $5 minimum on card purchases (the socks were under that!). I dont have cash I guess i'll have to find something to add to my purchase in order to buy it.' And he was like 'yep.' and then he went and bought something for his friend at the same store. He could've easily just paid for my socks under that purchase but no. This is just an example of what i mean. he'll buy gifts for other people, but never buys gifts for me. ever. even for holidays and birthdays. i dont want to sound shallow but sometimes i'd like to be treated.

**TL;DR** My boyfriend who makes more money than me insists on going halfsies for meals and will *never* buy me anything *ever.*"
"SO[35M]'s parents [65?M/F] doesn't like me[31F] because I'm not like his son.


My situation is really weird. 

**Explanation:** I'm what the deaf (non-verbal audio) classify as Hard hearing (HH) because I can communicate with hearing person without resorting sign languages or notes. 

I met my boyfriend, ""Alan"", who is deaf about year ago. I was the only person he could communicate at work with ASL, even though I only could sign basic words. Later, he began to teach me in more advanced ASL and we found out we have so much in common in tv, movies, books tastes with similar goals and desires in life that we became best friends that evolved into a romantic relationship. We're going strong nine months now and we're compatible in every area. It's the best and healthiest relationship I ever had and I'm always excited and giddy to see him at work or when we wake up together. He feels the same and we're talking moving each other as soon his lease is up in three months from now.  

Two months ago, we decided to meet each other parents which all are hearing (he's their only deaf son). Alan met mine and it went fabulous. Then we met his parents, ""Irma"" and ""Paul"". 

I thought we got along because they were smiling, gushing and laughing but I'm beginning to believe they were putting their best masks for the sake of their son. One time on a family's bday parties, Irma said in front of the ladies with me next to her, ""It's so impressive you can talk with that speech impediment. I barely can understand you myself."" She said as jokingly manner but no one laughed, everyone glanced at each other awkwardly and I just stared at her, then excused myself. At first I wasn't sure if she meant as generational-ignorant way like ""who's the woman in the relationship?"" to the gays. I didn't mention to my boyfriend because I was hoping it was only time remark.

It wasn't. They made more comments, mostly Irma, about me struggling pronunciation or grammars, using sign language incorrectly and not teaching me the right one like Alan would do, or not having deaf/HH friends or not going more to deaf community and so on. It happened so gradual and subtle that I didn't realize they were being insulting to my face that to this day I still wonder. Most of the time they would make those comments without Alan nearby. I mentioned to Alan few times and he told me that maybe they were worried I might not understand the deaf culture. He talked to them that saying those things weren't helpful and he would appreciate if they would shut it up. They didn't.  

Few weeks ago at bbq party, Irma and Paul sort of insinuated about my parent for not giving best tool for me, saying it was a shame that my parent didn't put me in deaf school or letting me to get cochlea implant or letting me to study aboard in non-deaf university program. They made it sound as if my parent crippled me as person because my social and emotional network didn't consist the ""right"" people. This time I got angry and I said what they said was rude, that my parents made lot sacrifice for me and no one has the right to belittle for their choices about raising me. Alan caught at the end of the conversation (lipreading) and asked me what's going on. Not so surprisingly, Alan's parent threw me under the bus, remarking I was so sensitive after making such innocuous comment. Alan saw I was uncomfortable and asked me if I want to leave. I said yes and we left, when we got home he asked me what they said to me. I didn't want to say what his parent told me because it was so ugly to talk about it but I told him anyway and he got upset for me. He face-timed them and said they shouldn't said that. He told them they crossed the line. They pretended they didn't know what I was talking about, that perhaps I misunderstood, considering I'm ""hard hearing"" which upset Alan even more. They ended arguing for few minute before Alan hung up. 

Since then, Alan has become desolate and needy. He apologized to me hundred of times for not believing me what I said before. I told them that he has nothing to apologize because I wasn't sure if they were being snide toward me until now and I'm not going to blame Alan for what his parent said to me. He told me he's thinking reducing contact with them but I told Alan it wasn't necessary. He can do whatever he wants with his parent but that I rather would not go to any of his family gathering or go his parent's. He assured he would never force me or put me in that situation ever again. 

We're closer together than we were but he's still sad and he no longer goes to his family gatherings or his parent's. I find him staring at nothing in particular for long minutes and his eyes which used to sparkle are now dim. I want to cheer him up but I'm not so sure how to in first place. I just don't know what to do and I don't understand why his parents are so rude toward me because I'm not ""completely"" deaf considering they aren't one!

What I can do? 

**TL;DR** : My SO's parent (hearing) doesn't like me because I'm (Hard Hearing) not completely deaf like he is. SO found out and he's upset. "
"I (f25) chose to let nonpregnant cousin (f25) over pregnant cousin (f27) to move in with me


 

So I (25) recently inherited a 4 bedroom house in a the suburbs not to far from the beach near LA. I own the house outright, so no mortgage or anything. I was very excited about the prospect of getting a little more independence, but at the same time I didn't really want to live alone yet. So, I started looking for a roommate. Being that I don't need to pay a mortgage I thought I could offer a really great deal and get my ideal roommate. Someone who had a similar lifestyle to me.

&amp;#x200B;

A few weeks ago my family found out that my cousin on my moms side, Lupe (27), is pregnant. The dad is not in the picture. She currently lives with her dad in a 2 bedroom apartment about a 45 minute drive from the town where my new house is, which also happens to be the town where her job is. So we (Lupe, her dad, and my other cousin, Maria (32) all went out to lunch a week or so later. The subject of my new house came up and Maria asked me if I was going to have a roommate. I said I was. The conversation then started getting steered towards how it would be so great for Lupe and the baby to live there. The town is safe, there's lots of parks, good school district, its so close to her work, the house has so much space, etc. I felt very put on the spot and just said I was waiting to hear from a few other people.

&amp;#x200B;

When I got home I thought about it some more and decided I definitely did not want to live with Lupe and a newborn. I'm still pretty young and want to be able to have fun without worrying that there's a baby in the house. I didn't want to have to turn one of my bedrooms into a nursery. I wanted a computer room and a room dedicated to my art projects, not a nursery. I didn't even want to baby proof the house at all. So, in a panic I started messaging all my best friends and family on my dads side to see if anyone wanted to move in with me for $600 a month (which is a pretty great deal around here).

&amp;#x200B;

The next day my cousin Alice (25) on my dads side says she would totally be up for it. I was so happy. We're the same age and spent so much time growing up with each other, Our hobbies and backgrounds are very similar, so, I said great.

&amp;#x200B;

When my moms side of the family found out they started hinting that I was playing favorites with my dads side of the family. Which is kind of true. I spent a lot more time with them then I ever did with my moms side of the family. Basically every holiday I spent with them. We went on trips together. In general I think I'm just more comfortable with them. Which does makes me feel like an asshole. Lupe asked before anyone else about moving in and it would definitely have made her life a lot easier if she lived with me, but I just didn't want to live with her.

&amp;#x200B;

So anyway it was suggested in the other sub that I find some way to make things up to my pregnant cousin. Any ideas?

&amp;#x200B;

TD:LR    I (f25) chose to let nonpregnant cousin (f25) over pregnant cousin (f27) to move in with me at my house at a reduced price because I want to have fun/not live with a baby; even though it would really help out pregnant cousin.  "
"My [25F] wife [28F] of ~5 years cheated on me, and now she's mad at me for still being upset by it.


We've been together for 4 1/2 years. Last October my partner had an affair with someone [2?M] that lasted about 3 months. I found out in late January by reading her texts/ facebook messages. They apparently only had sex 3 times, but they continued exchanging explicit texts/ pictures for months. 

We talked a lot about it at the time, and I decided to forgive her and stay with her. She was really apologetic and everything for a couple of weeks, and I accepted it even though it still hurts me. 

Today I brought it up again, because she asked why I was acting all mad at her, and she blew up at me to stop obsessing over it, and that I should be over it by now because we've talked through it, and ""how long are you going to hold this against me?"", and she said she was sorry, etc. 

I sort of feel like she's right, and I should just get over it, but am I being unreasonable? Am I still allowed to be upset at her? How long is too long? My brother [22M] says that she's being emotionally abusive and trying to manipulate me, but I don't feel abused?

I'm really confused and I don't know what I should think or do, or how to handle any of this..

tl;dr: My partner cheated on me like 6 months ago, how long am I allowed to be upset about it? "
"I (32F) think that my friend (30F) has a crush on my husband (32F) despite her telling me she doesn’t. What happened at my birthday party last night feels as if it’s gone too far?


I have a friend, let’s called her Lola. We’ve been best friends since we were 16 and are now both into our 30’s. This past year, she’s been exhibiting behaviour that is causing me to rethink the friendship.

So to skip all the fluff, last night three of my friends came over to celebrate my birthday. We watched a movie on the couch because I was recently in a car accident and am on bed rest. While my husband, Steve, and my other two friends were in the smoking room, Lola comes up to me in the living room and says, “Hey, do I have your permission to ask Steve to follow me to “friend’s” house in his car?”

Me: “You don’t need my permission to ask him but I already know the answer and he’ll say no. He’s really tired. So just leave him be. Why do you want him to follow you, your tire will make it.”

Lola: “Yeah but are you ok with me asking?”

Continuous back and forth about me asking “why?” and her saying “are you one with it?”

Me, getting frustrated: ”Lola, your tire is fine. You’ll make it. Besides, he’ll say no. He just spent all day at school, went to the gym, then he took care of the kids and still has to put them to bed and then do his homework. He’s really tired and he’s going to say no.”

Lola: “I know all that but still. Are you ok with it?”

Me: “Ok with what?!”

Lola: “Me asking Steve to follow me.”

Me, frustrated: “Why do you need my permission?!”

Lola: “To see if you’re ok with it.”

Me, very frustrated at this point,: “I don’t care if you ask him but he’s going to say no! He’s tired and would rather be at home with his family. And I don’t know why you’re asking because even though I’m telling you that he will say no and why he’ll say no, but let me guess, you’re going to go in that room and ask anyway. Right? Lola, why would he want to leave his family to take you home?”

Lola: “Because he cares about me and wants to make sure I get there safely.”

Me: “I think he would rather be home helping his injured wife on her birthday than following you “friend’s” place. You know what, Lola... Whatever! Go ask him but he’s going to say no. Why even bother asking?!”

Lola, biggest smile on her face: “He won’t! He cares about me.”

She goes straight into the room and in front of everyone goes, “Steeeeeevvvee would you follow me in your car?”

My husband, who is a comedian at heart, answered the nicest way, but I could tell he surprised/annoyed, “Follow you? Why?” When she tells him about her tire, he says, “Lola, your tire is fine. I’m really tired and you know that. I had a long day and still have homework.” Everyone in the room agreed that the tire is fine told her to calm down when she got a bit upset, “But don’t you want to see me home safe?” Steve: “Lisa needs my help. You’re fine.”

She left. Was gone for two hours then came back and stayed quiet until Steve came down around 10pm to finish the movie with us. That’s when she perked up and started talking again.

That was last night and I would have brushed it off but then add the comments like, “Yeah, Steve’s hot. I’d do him.” Always asking if her clothes are appropriate to wear in front of him... but then goes and wears the lowest cut top ever. When she came over and did mushrooms, she only wanted him to help her and when he was gone because he was sick of her hanging off him, kept asking where he was and when he was coming back. Then she’s sent me a nude and an explicit video of her and said, “Don’t show Steve!” Like, why the hell would I show him in the first place?! 

And her track record for dating married men is... well, it has me worried as she says it’s ok if the relationship isn’t doing well... anyway, I had a conversation with her just this week about the things she says regarding Steve makes me uncomfortable. Then this happened last night. She’s a family friend and considered another daughter to my family... so I don’t know what to do.

Am I reading into things? Lola says I am. Steve says that she is just weird but has no boundaries. But I think she likes him... and I want to cut contact but can’t due to seeing her at family functions. Can’t talk to our friend group. Can’t really talk to my parents because they don’t think she likes him but they agree she has issues and needs therapy. 

Ugh... I just don’t know what to do.

TD;LR: best friend went and asked my husband, after I told her not to, to follow her in her car to another city during my birthday party. He said no. She was a bit upset. She’s also made comments about how he’s so hot she’d do him. Am I overreacting by thinking she has a crush and it’s too far... therefore not inviting her to visit again because it makes me uncomfortable when she’s around him? Already talked to her before birthday incident happened and she thinks I am because “he’s my brother!” "
"[Update] I [24/F] found panties, and he [28/M] denied knowing anything about them, then proceeded to confess that he wasn’t sure about us. Help.


 [Original Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/b0bz2r/how_do_i_24f_go_about_bringing_up_timelines_with/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app)

I just got back from a short trip abroad, and decided now would be a perfect time to ask where he was at with us. I had already decided not to move in with him, as he wasn’t showing he was all that interested in it happening, and I know that’s not a decision you take lightly. So I went over his house, things were going well, and he left to pick up dinner for us. 

I then got a call from my sister, who said an anonymous account had messaged her on Instagram. This person told her that he had been cheating on me while I was away, and that she left panties behind the couch so I’d know it was real. Well, I found the panties. Placed them on the coffee table and waited for him to return. 

I confronted him very calmly, and he absolutely swore he had no idea who’s they were, nor how they got into his house. I of course didn’t believe him, but he kept insisting. Said he would not hesitate to break up with me before cheating. I honestly wouldn’t put it past his stalker to break into his house to plant them there, but I also feel stupid for even thinking that. Some details in her message also didn’t add up, and he said the door wasn’t locked when he got home earlier, so there’s that. Whatever. 

After that whole exchange, I felt pretty emblazoned and just straight out asked him where his head was at. That as happy as I was, I didn’t really know how he felt about me, or if he even thought about a future together, because he never tells me. He proceeded to say what I was hoping he wouldn’t. That he still isn’t sure about us, thinks we may be incompatible, but can’t really tell. His reasoning was shoddy and he admitted I was the best person he’s ever dated, that I’m a great person, a total catch, and we have amazing sex. He just feels something is off.

I called him out and told him what he’s feeling most likely has to do with attachment issues and defense mechanisms he’s built up because of his last relationship, and the relationships he’s witnessed growing up (his parents divorced and both remarried into pretty toxic circumstances, and his ex he was with for four years had extreme anxiety and they scream fought all the time (but were also obsessed with each other)). It may have been wrong of me to do so, but I know him and it’s plainly obvious he’s been self sabotaging his emotional progression in this relationship. 

Anyway, I left. Told him I didn’t want to do it anymore, because I’ve given him 100% since the beginning, and I’d rather give myself that 100% than be with someone who won’t even try. He texted me after I left a long paragraph, and I sent him one as well. His mainly about how he does love me and is just confused, and admitting to the issues I’ve known he has. Told me he’d miss me dearly if this really is the end. Mine reiterated how I was disappointed, and hurt I am, and how much I loved him...just trying to explain my devastation. 

I don’t know if this is really the end, I guess it should be, but it just hurts so bad. I never once imagined a future without him ever since we met. He was supposed to be it. Now I just feel exhausted and betrayed and really freaking sad. So yeah, there you go if anyone was curious to see how that went. 

TL;DR: Was hoping to get a feel for where my boyfriend was at in terms of our relationship, being happy, wanting to move in together. Before I could bring it up, was told via an anonymous message I could find panties behind the couch, as he had been cheating. Confronted him, he denied knowing anything about them, think there was a break in or something (He has a stalker so not totally unbelievable, but still). Then proceeds to tell me that he’s not sure about us, and he loves me but he’s had doubts about compatible we really are. I walked out. "
"My [36m] wife [34f] ""opened up"" about our marriage and basically said it was a sham


After 13 years of marriage my wife told me:
- she didn't ever find me attractive
- she only married because she was told to by her mother
- she only had kids because they gave her affection I didn't
- we never really ""clicked""
- she had rekindled an emotional relationship with her ex boyfriend and could imagine growing old with him
- she didn't care if I or a nanny took care of the kids
- if she saw me in the street tomorrow there would be no reason to even look at me

At the same time she told me how she could imagine us being great friends, I'm an amazing father and provider and am very caring.

She said this frankly and without emotion and said she holds no anger towards me.

I have suspicions she may be on the spectrum but interested to know if anyone else has been on the receiving end of this type of feedback. Generally people seem to tell me no matter how nasty their ex was they didn't say things that hurtful.

Tl;dr wife calmly told me our marriage was essentially a sham"
"Boyfriend (31M) got/did nothing for my bday (26F)


For his birthday, I took him to dinner, the next day we went to a bbq/cake at his parents for him, and got him a few small gifts. He seemed excited about his birthday, helped his parents in the plans, and mentioned several times the week prior “Ooo what are you getting me?” Etc. 


He got me nothing. He didn’t ask to take me out to dinner. He did send a “Happy Bday” text at least. I don’t have family or friends really in the area we live, so I just ended up spending my birthday alone and didn’t get a present from anyone. 

I wasn’t mad, but it hurt my feelings. I mentioned it to him, he told me I was silly to celebrate birthdays at my age and that they “aren’t important to him” it’s “just another day”. I found this rude and hypocritical, because he made a much larger deal about his Bday and celebrated it- but suddenly its not appropriate for me to have wanted to go to dinner or receive a card? 

His attitude towards it has upset me far more than the lack of gift. Am I being a bit childish for being bothered about a birthday or is his behavior as unacceptable as I think? 

TLDR: Boyfriend didn’t get Bday present

"Boyfriend(35M) got a second dog (puppy) behind my (28F) back when he doesn't even take care of his 4 kids! He says he is depressed and ""needs"" the dog. Am I wrong for telling him to rehome the dog?


 My boyfriend brought home a 6-month-old puppy while I was out of town and I am LIVID.

\*Long back story\*

Dog's backstory: Our friends breed their male Doberman. They keep one puppy out of the litters normally and sell it. They tried to pressure my BF to buy the pup so it stays in our group of friends and can come camping with us on our group trips.

Our Family Backstory: My boyfriend has 4 boys (16, 11, 8, 3). I always thought my BF was a great father to his 4 kids until we got a house and moved in together. I've noticed that he is actually a very absent father and doesn't engage with his kids. Over the first 8 months of living together in our home, he has become less and less of a parent. I have basically taken on the role of being a single mom of his kids in the house. I LOVE his kids and they make me so happy. I truly enjoy being a mom.... But I resent my BF for spending hours and hours on his phone ignoring his kids!!! I had him check his phone last week and his phone said he spent 40 hours on Facebook, 22 on Instagram, and 18 on Facebook Messenger in the last 10 days. THAT'S INSANE! Additionally, he sleeps for hours and hours all day and says he has headaches constantly. Conveniently, his sleeping issues and headaches are always on days we have his kids, so I become a single parent those days. He is so distant and detached from our family. His kids beg for his attention and he doesn't provide it. He says it's because of his head injury but he did this stuff way before our car accident.

Car Accident: We got in a severe car accident in my car 3 months ago when a drunk driver hit us head on on the freeway. We both had severe concussions- his was worse than mine. I suffered other injuries and broken bones as well. Things have been really rough. We have both struggled. I lost my job due to medical treatment and BF was put on medical leave then reduced hours as a ER Charge Nurse. He is having memory problems and was forgetting what meds went to what patients. We have both been very depressed and trying to recover from our traumatic accident. He has become very suicidal and has been difficult to get professional treatment for. It's like pulling teeth to get him to go to his therapists and neurologist. His suicidality has gotten worse the last month ish and (even though I'm still recovering) I have had to pick up the slack in our household.

When this whole dog idea started 5 months ago, I was very against it. I love love love animals, don't get me wrong. In a perfect world, I would have a zoo in my backyard. But I know the reality of life-- we have 4 kids at home, my dog from before we were together, and 10 chickens. I'm an adult and understand that we have adult responsibilities! The kids take a lot of our financial resources and time. I am exhausted at the end of the day after taking care of all the kids, cooking, cleaning, teaching his 3 year old preschool material, driving the kids to school gymnastics and piano, etc... and he constantly says he is overwhelmed. Why the hell would adding another dog to the mix be the right thing to do?

BF tried to guilt me into taking the pup when it was 8 weeks old for a ""trial weekend"". The puppy had diarrhea the first night and stayed up both nights whining, barking, etc in the crate. I was up each night, all night, taking care of the puppy and pottying it while my BF slept. He has the amazing ability to sleep through everything and ignore things. Of course the kids loved the puppy, but I can't take care of another living creature in the house. I told him this was a terrible time to get a puppy and we can talk about it another time way down the road. We gave the puppy back.

Apparently, he told our friends that he didn't have time to potty train it but might take it when it is older and potty trained. I told him to break the news to our friends and say we CANNOT keep the dog but I don't think he did that. Throughout the last few months, our friends regularly talk about how cute the puppy is and about how he's potty trained etc... I kept reminding my boyfriend that we cannot have another dog. The pup is cute and they will easily find a home for him. I was starting to get suspicious about what was going on recently because our friends still had the dog after 5 months. I thought that was weird because if they say they can't keep a third dog, why aren't they finding it a home? Well, after some probing, my BF tells me I'm the only one who thinks we aren't buying the puppy still... I told him to call our friends. Supposedly he called them and they were very upset because he ""gave them his word and broke a deal to buy the dog after it was potty trained."" WTF! Now I look like the bad guy to our friends. I look like the meanie who won't let him get a cute puppy. I told him that he can make whatever decisions he wants to make, but if he gets the puppy, I will move out. I told him that it is irresponsible to get another dog when we already have a hard time making ends meet as it is AND both of us are dealing with mental health issues and injuries after our accident. Additionally, I told him that it is my boundary and I cannot sit by and watch him not care for his kids but get another dog that distracts him from his responsibility to his kids.

Fast forward to now:

I called him while out of town last night and he said he went to dinner with our friends where they live 2 hrs away. I thought that was a pretty far drive... even asked ""Are they still pressuring you into buying the puppy? Have they found a new home for him?"" He said yes they are pressuring him and they still have the pup. I responded by saying ""Well, I hope they find a good home for him if they don't want to keep him.""........plenty of opportunity for boyfriend to say something.

He called me while he was driving home. At one point in the convo when I asked about how the puppy is, he said ""How mad would you be if the puppy was in the car with me right now?"" WHAT??? How mad? FURIOUS. I was so angry. Still am!

I told him that this was my boundary. I cannot live with the puppy and sit around watching him prioritize a puppy over his responsibility to our family, his kids, and taking care of his serious suicidal mental health issues. He told me he didn't understand how mad I would be, but why would he lie and go behind my back when I'm out of town if he didn't know I would be mad? He then tried to say ""But the kids love the puppy"" DUH. I love animals too. Doesn't mean a 3 year old should make a life changing decision about a 12-15 year dog commitment!

Lastly, I have told him that it means a lot to me to have my dog be an only fur-child. He gets really jealous and upset when his humans (mostly me and my BF) pet other dogs. He pushes dogs away to get attention when other dogs are around. I love taking him camping and on play dates with other dogs, but my dog loves coming home and being an only dog-child. He is obsessed with my boyfriend's kids and the greatest dog I have ever met. He truly is an amazing Labrador and I don't want him to live out his golden years (he's 6) trying to fight for attention with this puppy around.

I fly home tomorrow and I don't know what to do. I feel like a horrible person. But I feel like morally, I cannot live in the house and see my boyfriend put a dog above his kids, himself, and our relationship. I feel like he might call my bluff and try to keep the dog when I get back. He doesn't seem at all concerned about it taking his attention away from his kids. He also cried and said that he feels like the dog is the only thing keeping him from committing suicide and he ""needs"" the dog. I feel like he is also literally choosing having a dog over me. He went behind my back when he knew my boundaries. 

Am I horrible for standing my ground and keeping my promise that if he keeps the dog, I am moving out? I don't want to but I don't know what else to do... 

Is there another possible solution that would allow him to keep the dog?

Am I being fair that I think he should put his kids above a dog?

&amp;#x200B;

 

\*\*TL;DR;\*\* : My boyfriend went behind my back and got a puppy when he can’t even handle his own life/ kids and existing pets. I don’t know what to do and not sure if I’m making the right choice."
"I [21F] don’t know how to have a tough conversation with my boyfriend [22M]


Made a throwaway to seek help.
Some background: my BF and I have been together 1.5 years. Our personalities work well together, and we’re generally pretty loving. Of our friends, we’re usually the couple people go to for advice. And normally, he’s one of the nicest people I know. He looks out for others, and is always giving.
But, we’ve got one big problem and I’m hitting a breaking point. I’d like to sit him down later this week, when we’re not in the moment, and talk it out with him.

Before we met, I was assaulted. I’m dealing with it, and am finally starting therapy as soon as our university can fit me, but it’s left me with a few hang ups. Mainly, I cannot give oral. He is aware of my past, and aware that I’m not comfortable with providing that, but I don’t think he’s really made the connection between the two. I’m consistently pressured to provide. Very early on, I did once or twice and it was miserable. I was anxious, I was flooded with memories of what had happened before, it left me in a funk for a solid couple of days.

I’ve told him he can have anything else- literally any other act is okay, and I don’t expect him to give me what he’s not receiving. Things aren’t dead otherwise- we’re a consistent 2-3 times a week at least. 
For the last few months though, he’ll still ask and push every two weeks or so. When I say “I’m sorry but I can’t do that, do you want x or y instead?” He’ll brood, and then after a period of silence and saying he’s fine when I ask, he’ll start talking.
He says it seems like I don’t love him or am not attracted to him because of the lack of oral, and how he has a hard time imagining the rest of his life without. I apologize every time, I offer alternatives, and I remind him of all the ways I love him. 
I’m a fairly affectionate person, and in a normal week I do a lot to show him how loved he is. I make him dinner, I surprise him with gifts, I’m always kissing him and hugging him. We still partake in other activities pretty frequently. I tell him how proud I am of him, and how great he’s doing at (academic thing), and how thankful I am for him.

He did it again last week, and admitted he’d been changing his workout patterns and stuff trying to make me attracted to him again. But the thing is, I am and try my hardest to show him that.

I’d like to sit him down later this week and explain
1. The in-depth details of why I’m not comfortable with it
2. The way these conversations have made me feel

At the end of it, in all honesty, I’m prepared to say basically “this is your get out of jail free card. At present, I don’t know if I’ll ever be able to provide what you’re asking for, so I’ll give you a day or two. At the end of that time we can either go our separate ways with no hard feelings, or we can stay together and work to improve. But if we stay together, I don’t want to have to hear about how hard the prospect of forever is. I will listen and try to show my love in ways more tangible to you, but I have to draw the line when you’re asking for something that actively harms my mental well-being” 

Would that be reasonable? I don’t want to just break up with him without trying to work this out, but I can’t be in a relationship anymore that pressures me constantly to do something I’m deeply uncomfortable with. I don’t know how to say this in a way that gets my point across firmly, but shows I’m still open to conversation and not completely fragile. 

TL;DR - boyfriend [22M] wants something I [21F] cannot provide due to trauma, and has been pretty pushy. Says it feels like I’m not attracted to him anymore, and that he has a hard time thinking. Of forever with it, though we still do other things a few times a week. I want to have a conversation about it when we’re removed from the situation itself &amp; give him a choice, not sure how to broach the topic though. "
"Me [20M] with my father [40M] who I met months ago, and his girlfriend [26/7F]. I feel like I'm in a mess.


So this is gonna be weird all around because that's how my life goes, apparently. 

I have a job, a girlfriend and am quite happy. We live together, we have our own little business and everything. I never knew my real parents. And forthe logest time, that didn't bother me. Then I met my uncle, by chance and soon after I met my father. They're twins, my uncle and my father, and my father, well, he didn't know about me. At all. He had a one nght stand, I was the result but he was long gone before he could know about me.

Anyway I won't bother anyone with details that mean nothing to th story. We're getting along, my father and I. He's rather reserved and very introverted, my uncle is the opposite. It's been nice, finding them, I mean.

Now, to the weird part. There's this girl, she's around 26/27. Very gorgeous, very smart, funny and somehow very reserved too. She's, apparently, my father's girlfriend. Their story is pretty deep from what my uncle tells me. Like, she understands my father and vice versa. She's been through a lot, appafrently, a lot more than she should.

Thing is, she started getting close to me too. And I thought I was going to hate it. But I actually like having her around. She knows my father and I are very awkward around each other still, but she keeps coming up with these plans to get us to talk more. And they're very obvious and we're always on to her but the thing is, it works. I've been getting closer to my dad thanks to her. And in the process, I don't know, I guess I started seeing her in a motherly figure. And it hit me how weird this is. She's closer to my age. She could be my sister. Instead I look at her as a mother. 

And that was the problem until I find out she's pregnant with my father's child and it's high risk and she's been feeling ill so she's spending the night in observation. 

I'm with my father. And I'm feeling so scared for her. And feeling weird about it. What should I do in this situation? Any advice would help becuse I honestly don't know how to act.

**tl.dr:** found my dad, dad is cool, his girlfriend is cool and i'm feeling weird about all of this and the things that are happening. "
"I (46f) was stood up for hours by my friend (48F) now she's mad at me


She's flaky and always really late but this was unreal. I (46F) just waited for \~5/6 hours for my friend (48F) to show up at a campsite that I got for her at the last minute where I work. 

It was risky to ask for it at the last minute and I called in a favor because she said she needed it. Then she is two days late driving from where she's living. I blew that off but it was worrying. Today, she's supposed to be right behind me driving to the campsite. I get there but after waiting for an hour, as she was supposed to just pick up her cousin from about 5 miles away, I called her, then texted, then called, then texted. 2 1/2 hours later, I get a text back from her saying her cousin had some plumbing issue and it was done and they were on their way. Finally. It's getting dark so I start a fire and wait. I get another text after 45 minutes or so from the cousin that says they're on their way, sorry for lagging. So I wait. I beg some more firewood off some other campers and wait. I get a text from the cousin again, not my friend, that says, ""You can always come here."" I write, ""but I have the fire going..."" The response says, ""We're on our way."" 

\~5 hours later, one more text of ""we're on our way"" and I've finally had it and go home. 

I'm home for about 30 minutes and get one last text, again from the cousin and not my friend, that says, we're on our way. By this time it had been \~6 hours since my friend agreed to meet me after picking up her cousin. 

I respond that she needs to drop off what she has of mine in her car at the security gate and leave the campsite I had finagled for her. At this point, I can't trust she won't disrespect my place of employment if she's going to disrespect me so much.

She sends me an incredibly long text about how she'd missed her cousin and that she doesn't put up with passive-aggressiveness and how she's been going through things, etc., and on and on. She also mentions that I could've picked up any time and come over to the cousin's house. 

Am I crazy or is telling someone you're showing up hour after hour and not showing up extremely rude? Is getting mad at me for being upset for being stood up out-of-line? Who is crazy here? I'm shocked and really mad. I can't imagine keeping someone waiting for hours and then being indignant that my personal issues weren't taken into consideration. I probably should've waited till morning to say something and probably shouldn't have told her I was cancelling the whole reservation but I don't think I was the one at fault. What should I have done? I'm honestly bewildered.

TL:DR Friend stands me up for hours and is mad I didn't consider her feelings. "
"How do I (22F and recently single) set boundaries with male friends?


I recently ended an LTR after a long time. I’m doing well but have absolutely zero interest in dating right now.

My problem is that male friends that I have always had purely platonic relationships with seemingly think I’m fair game now?

For example, a male friend of mine who is also friends with my ex asked to come and hang out. We hang out frequently (admittedly not at my place), and I assumed this would be as normal. But when he got here he kept touching me, making bizarre uninvited sexual comments, and I had to be painfully distant to make him get the picture and leave.

A couple of dudes at work that I have casual friendships with have changed the way they interact with me slightly - making sexual jokes, asking how my love life is since the breakup etc.

Tomorrow I agreed to go to an event with a friend of mine on the basis that it’s a work do and there’s free booze. He mentioned in conversation that people can only bring long term partners, so I’ll have to pretend to be dating him if people ask? No thanks.

So my question is: Is this normal behaviour? How do I communicate clearly with these friends that I am in no way sexually attracted to them without being rude or presumptuous?

TL;DR - recently out of an LTR and suddenly a few platonic male friends are acting weird/flirty/sexual. I’m not into it and need tips on how to tell them I’m not interested without blatantly telling them to fuck off."
"Update: Bad coworker


Original post is here:  [https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/avyz52/how\_do\_i\_33f\_nicely\_confront\_a\_coworker\_30sf/](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/avyz52/how_do_i_33f_nicely_confront_a_coworker_30sf/) 

&amp;#x200B;

So, my original post didn't get a whole lot of traction, but it seemed that there were some posters who didn't think confronting K (or, really, having a friendly chat) was a great idea. However, I really felt miserable at work with all the tension, and people who knew much more about the situation than I was able to convey on Reddit urged me to do SOMETHING, so I did. 

&amp;#x200B;

I waited until the end of the day on Friday. I even brought notes with me so that I didn't say anything stupid. I asked K to come into the hall and I basically went down the points on my notes: that I felt a lot of tension lately, (she agreed with that assessment but said that she wasn't about to do anything to address it) that I was sorry for snapping at her a few days earlier and it was unprofessional. I explained my reasoning why I was driven to that point--not as an excuse, but more of an explanation--that I felt (and perhaps I was wrong!) that she doesn't respect me as a coworker. 

&amp;#x200B;

Her response? ""Yeah, because you make a lot of mistakes."" Ah, ok, so there it was. I was at the same time shocked and... well, not. It was a confirmation of what I'd suspected. I continued the conversation by stating that when I found mistakes that she makes, I don't go out of my way to make her feel bad about it, and don't doubt her abilities, but I just fix them. And I stated that we don't have to be best friends, and we should be looking out for each other and not working against each other. She begrudgingly agreed, said we were ""good,"" and that she has a tendency to overreact at things, but was overall kind of cool about the whole thing. I personally felt relieved but also personally kind of stung, that my performance at work was apparently so bad. 

&amp;#x200B;

I spent the weekend thinking a lot about our conversation, and what I could do differently at work, performance wise--not just for her, but for myself. Because I feel better about myself when I do a good job (doesn't everyone?). I came back to work the next week and busied myself on making step-by-step notes on all of the most common things I do. A month later, I still refer to them. I know everything on them, it's just handy for me to refer to them so I don't forget. (I have ADHD, and that absolutely figures in to the mistakes.) A few days ago, while K was on vacation and our newest tech was training, I gave her a copy of the step-by-step notes for her to use for a task I asked her to do. To my delight, she used them all week, which made me feel like maybe the work we do is a bit harder than I give myself credit for. 

&amp;#x200B;

I've also done my part in covering my own butt and letting other people know what is going on. Turns out K has been spreading quite a bit of gossip about me, which has made me look even worse because I don't really gossip. So everyone who thinks they know what's going on only gets one side. Last week I met with my boss for our regularly scheduled one-on-one session. It was the first time that I'd had one since our little spat. And I told her about my conversation with K. She was impressed that I'd been the bigger person and broached the topic with her. But she was appalled at K's response about feeling disrespected. In her mind (and mine), being respected at work is just a basic right, it shouldn't be tied into whether you're performing your job adequately or not. I told my boss about a couple other little episodes that K and I had had since that larger one, and that I'd defused the potential conflicts and not bit back--something that my boss was thankful for, and also complementary of. She stressed to me to let her know these things, because I'm pretty quiet and while she knew that K and I didn't really get along very well, she didn't know it was THAT bad. 

&amp;#x200B;

So, taking that advice to heart, and emboldened by my great, stress-free week without K, I snagged one of the pharmacists before leaving last night. I told her that, in case she hadn't noticed, K and I don't get along that well (she rolled her eyes and stated that she and the other pharmacists had definitely noticed). I told her that I was only telling her all this because I wanted her to know that it had been going on for a while, and I hadn't really mentioned it because I figured she and the other pharmacists had better things to do than get involved or take sides in a spat. I told her that I was a little offended that K would even tell them before trying to work it out with me personally, because it seemed petty and juvenile. I told her a little bit about the ""mistake"" that I'd made that caused K to react so angrily and that it turned out it wasn't really even a mistake, just an accident that I'd never anticipated. And that while I don't complain to her about K and K DOES complain to her about me, to just try to keep an open mind and not assume that I was always in the wrong. She told me some enlightening things about K, that there had been problems with K before I even came along, and she knew more about the situation than I realized. She also reiterated that I do a good job overall and not to let K bring me down.

&amp;#x200B;

So, I left work yesterday feeling great. A week without K, making a difference in training our new tech, taking the lead on some issues that popped up, and showing that I could be just as good--if not better--a worker than K, without the drama. Basically, the best week I'd had in a long time. And in regards to K, it's the best I could hope for. I know she'll never like me. And that's ok, because she's such an irritable and unpleasant person that I don't really want her to like me. I just want to be able to do my job without her breathing down my neck all the time. At the very least, I've let other people--not everyone, but those who are in a position to know--about the issues we've been having. To get the burden off myself and put it on her. I've done all I can do, and I'm just glad that people have noticed. 

&amp;#x200B;

Tl;dr talked with offending coworker, who outright admitted to disrespected me because apparently she thinks I'm a shit employee. At least I got her to admit it. Now I'm going to take care of myself and doing my job. I also let others know about the issues we've been having so they're aware. "
"My[25M] wife's[24F] best friend[23F] sent me some questionable texts and now I am wondering how do I bring this up with my wife?


My wife and I are visiting her family in her hometown. She hasn't seen her family or her friends since our wedding (about 8 months ago) and she wanted to come and see them. So we decided to pay them a visit. 

My wife has 4 very close female friends of hers. 2 of them are her childhood friends and 2 are from high school. She is super close to them and she spends times with them whenever she can. Of course, I've met them before and I can say I enjoy their company. They've always been nice to me and I feel welcome in their company. 

So on Saturday night, me, my wife, her friends, and their respective partners went out for dinner. I should point out that only two of my wife's friends are currently dating, while the other two are single. We have a great night together and at some point, one of my wife's friends propose we go to this club that a mutual friend of theirs opened up a few months ago. 

After a quick discussion, we all agree on going. We get there, we get seated and everything is going perfect. We all get pretty wasted, we have a ton of fun, our little outing is a success. If we exclude the giant hangover I had Sunday morning, I enjoyed it a lot and minus a couple of blank spots, I remember pretty much the entire night.

I say this because to my surprise, when I woke up on Sunday and checked my phone, I noticed that I have a couple of messages that I haven't read the night before. They were from an unknown number and the first one read ""Meet me in the bathroom and we can have some fun ;) "". At this point, I am freaking out, fearing I did something stupid.

But the next message kinda comforted me a bit. It said ""Thanks for standing me up like an idiot."" It was sent half an hour after the first one. Later I found out through ""evidence"" that in the time period between the first and the second message, I was with my wife so I can positively say that I didn't do something stupid. But that didn't explain who sent me these texts. 

Until today. I was using my wife's phone for something completely different and I still don't know what pushed me to do it but I tried dialing the number that sent me the messages and see if my wife has that phone number on her phone. It was a long shot and in the back of my mind, I am having serious doubts that something will come up. 

But imagine my surprise and shock when I see that the number is in fact in my wife's phone. It belongs to her friend, Anna. I've spent almost the entire day thinking about what I might have done/said that Saturday night that will make her send me those messages. I've never been anything but friendly to Anna. We've never spent time together, just the two of us. It was always in the presence of my wife. 

But as I've said, there are some blank spots in my memory from Saturday and I fear that I might have done something inappropriate. Again, I know that I was with my wife during the time period between the two messages, but before that, I can't be certain. Or maybe nothing actually happened and I am freaking for no reason whatsoever. 

The point of this post is, how can I bring this up with my wife? I mean, I don't want to hide this from her, but it's her friend we are talking about. She knows this girl since they were kids and I don't want to be the cause of tension in her friend group. I like to think that she would believe me if I tell her that I didn't do anything wrong but I've been wrong before. So guys, how do I do this right?

tl;dr my wife's best friend sent me some questionable texts and now I am wondering how can I bring this up with my wife? "
"My (25F) husband (30M) says there's nothing wrong with using tinder to pass time.


We have been married for a year, together for 2. Just 2 days ago when he was signing into his phone I noticed him quickly exit an app he just using. That app was tinder.   

I had just worked a 15 hour day, and saw this within the first half hour of arriving at home. I had an immediate melt down. He wouldn't stop insisting he did nothing wrong because he had no intentions of meeting these people. That he found it as an entertaining pass time.   

I still can't believe he doesn't see anything wrong with this. I asked him to show me his tinder. He has been using this app since November. Which had me melt down even further.   

I've told him if he doesn't see an issue with this when I clearly do. I cannot continue this relationship with him. I am unhappy.   

For some extra context. We haven't been intimate for over a month. He will use my weight as the reason why he hasn't been as sexually attracted to me. So seeing him on tinder was another blow to my self esteem. Not only am I with a jealous man who would accuse me of being the cheater, he would also put me down because of my weight, in addition to ending sexy times because I've refused to give him anal. So finding him on tinder messaging young and thin women is really fucking with my head.   

Today. Still. He is defending himself. Not giving me clear answers on why he sees the need to use this app. Why he's been on it since November. He won't even tell me if he's either deactivated or deleted the account he has now. Making it clear he has intentions of continuing to use it. I feel so fucking heart broken. I cannot even look at him the same.   

Last night he was laughing at me because I was ""overreacting"" and still isn't taking me seriously when I say I don't want him anymore. I feel so broken down. I hate to say that I do still want him. It's become one of those cliche, my heart wants him but my brain is saying no.   

I feel so lost. How do you people actually stick by your word when you say it's over? It already feels so difficult. I know if I just forgive him. This is just going to happen all over again. But I already feel so burnt out. I just want to give up.   

TLDR; husband sees no issue with using tinder as a pass time. He's saying I'm overreacting as he hasn't done anything with anyone off the app."
"My [22F] cousin [25F] had an accident and blamed me for it.


Hi all.

My family and I live just in front of a large woodland area, where we often go exploring. I have lived there all my life and it is truly the most beautiful place. 

My brother Tom [27M] is getting married, and in our family when someone gets married usually the whole extended family comes to stay at the home of the bride/groom. 

On friday evening my aunt Eleanor, her husband Matthew and their daughter Freya came to stay. 

Freya is the polar opposite of me. She is so gorgeous that she was a model while she was studying, and is very smart and successful with a high paying career as a city banker. 

Please don't think I'm saying all this because I'm jealous. If she was anyone else I would be happy for her. However, Freya has had it in for me for as long as I can remember. When my parents used to force me to go to her birthday parties her and her friends would always pick on me, locking me out of the house and playing pranks, excluding me from games etc. I always left in tears but her parents saw the funny side. 

Freya still doesn't like me and whenever we see each other she is rude and dismissive. My parents think she is an angel. She is pretty and smart and successful and whenever they talk about her I just know that they think she's everything I'm not and they wish I was. 

They were barely here for 20 minutes and Freya had already made snotty comments about my job, my clothes and my weight. I wasn't in the mood and argued back. My mom could see that I was upset and suggested that as Freya has always lived in the city and hasn't been to our home in years, she should go and explore the woodlands. 

I went to work and did a short shift since there wasn't much to do, and by the time I got back it was starting to get dark. When I got in my mom said that Freya had not come back and asked if I could have a look for her. I agreed and went looking. I was calling for her but I got no response. 

On the far side of the woodland there is sort of steep drop. I went there and found Freya lying at the bottom of it. She had fallen down. The idiot wore heels when she went out exploring and must have lost her footing. By the looks of things she had injured her leg when she fell since her foot was in a bad position, which is why she couldn't climb out. However, she had a worse problem. 

Freya is type 1 diabetic. I don't know long she was down there but clearly long enough for her for her to start feeling sick without her medication. She was whimpering and moaning and couldn't speak. I'm not particularly strong, but I had to climb down and lift her up, and then climb up that ledge again to get Freya to safety. As soon as we got somewhere with a phone signal I called an ambulance and carried her back to the house. Her parents were obviously terrified and were demanding answers from me, and I told them everything I knew. 

The ambulance came and she was taken to hospital, where they brought her condition under control. She was kept at the hospital until today. However, yesterday morning Freya's mom tried to slap me, and said that Freya had told her that *I* pushed her down that ledge. I insisted that it wasn't true but she didn't believe me. Since I know about Freya's condition she accused me of trying to kill her daughter by stopping her from getting her insulin. She said they would be having the police on me. 

And the sad thing is that my parents, instead of defending me, sat me down and interrogated me, asking if I did in fact push Freya. I pointed out that I couldn't have done since shortly after she left I went to work. They did believe me, but I was upset that they didn't believe me straight away and actually thought I could do something like that. 

If the police do get involved I could end up in serious trouble for something I haven't done. 

How do I make prove that Freya is lying and that I'm not the kind of person to push someone down a ledge?

Tl;DR: My cousin who hates me fell down a ledge and got sick due to not having her medication. She then lied that I pushed her down. "
"My (15f) sister (21f) is angry because I called her engagement ritual dumb


So my sister is going to get engaged to her boyfriend (23m) soon. Yesterday she was telling me and our cousin (17f) how her bf is going to propose. I forget the whole process because it sounded so unnecessarily complicated... basically she's picking out a few types of rings that she finds acceptable, then sending our her BFF to monitor the boyfriend and make sure he gets a ring that's not under a certain price and standard. She also said she would break up with her bf if he came back with a wrong color, type of ring or whatever. Our cousin agreed with everything, but I thought to myself that's pretty stupid. I'm vocal about my opinions, so I asked my sister why not go shopping with her boyfriend directly instead of sending a friend to control him. I mean, since this is so important to her. She said I don't understand engagement and that it's important for a man to surprise a woman. So I told her, well shouldn't you be okay with whatever he picks if it's supposed to be a surprise. She laughed and said men are like pets, they don't understand such things unless you train them. I asked her why would you marry a pet, and she got really angry with me and told me off because I was acting like an annoying kid. So I felt hurt and called her whole engagement dumb. I kind of regret saying that because now she won't talk to me, only through our parents. They're already asking us what's wrong and telling us to apologize to each other. Should I say I'm sorry even though I still disagree with her opinions?

What do you guys think is right?

tl;dr: I got into a fight with my sister over her plan for engagement, now she's acting out by not talking to me. How should we make up?"
"I [26F] and my boyfriend [25M] about to move together when tells me he’s unhappy that I can’t drink. Don’t know if I should go ahead and move without him?


We started out living in the same place, but then I had a move for work, so we’ve been long distance for some time. 


Finally, I got the opportunity for an internal transfer so we could be in the same place. We picked Dallas, Texas to move to together for various reasons: cost of living, the chance at good in-state tuition for grad school, job opportunities, amount of transplants, weather... Plus, he had some friends already living there. 


He got a job, got a place, and moved down a few weeks ago. My transfer was just accepted, so I was preparing to move down in another few weeks. He was so happy and excited when at the news (or made a good show of it, if not) and said he couldn’t wait to have me there. I was counting down the days. 


Cut to today, he says he’s been having a blast reconnecting with his old friends. They’ve been going on benders over the weekends and he’s been living it up at bars and clubs with them, their friends, and their girlfriends.


Thing is, I can’t drink. Like, physiologically. I have a genetic mutation that makes my liver unable to metabolize the alcohol so I only feel sick when I drink it instead of good. (Alcohol intolerance aka “Asian glow.” I am Asian and he’s not). Some people who have this condition drink anyway, but I feel so awful when I try, I’ve given up. 


He says he’s been thinking that we might be happier if we go our separate ways since I can’t drink and he likes to. 


I’m in shock. He’s known this about me since day 1. I don’t feel like I act weird about it. I get my one drink to hold and sip on throughout the night so I don’t look out of place and I still have fun. I just can’t do multiple rounds or shots. 


Up to this point, our relationship has revolved around fun activities instead of drinking. He told me that’s been great and he’s done more things than ever, but then he revealed to me that this whole time he’s missed being able to go out and have fun drinking like he has in other relationships. He says he had more fun in past relationships being able to party and share that with them. 


He says a lot of what people do for fun in Dallas is going out to bars and drinking. He’s going to be doing that. So if I come, I won’t be able to participate and I’ll feel left out and unhappy. 


We haven’t officially broken up, but the conversation felt pretty final. I’m reeling. Moving to Dallas still makes sense for all the same reasons, and I can afford it just fine, but I didn’t expect to have to do it alone.


I’m also feeling discouraged over the idea that I won’t be able to make friends in Dallas if I can’t drink. It’s tapped into a major insecurity of mine. 

I’ve struggled in the past because the other people who don’t drink either do so for religious or moral reasons, or are the kind of people who don’t like going out altogether, so I don’t connect with them as much. I do like to go out and have a good time. I even go to raves. I just do it sober. 


But then if I’m in a group that’s drinking, they feel weird if I’m not drinking too. Not gonna lie, it sucks. IME, it actually bothers people. So that makes me feel bad and out of place. But...I can’t help how I was born. Sometimes it’s hard not to feel defective. 


Now I’m wondering if I should still go through with the move alone?Is this is going to be a major friendship barrier in Dallas? Are there people out there who are outgoing and like to be wild sometimes, but are also sober? Where do I find them? 


**Tl;dr** Can’t drink due to genetic condition. Right before we were set to move to a new city together, boyfriend reveals he’s missed being able to drink with his SO and hasn’t had as much fun with me because of it. Says new city has drinking culture he wants to take advantage of and that I won’t be able to make friends there as easily if I move. Don’t know how to feel and afraid he’s right. "
"My wife [37F] came unglued on me because I [38M] told my stepson [14M] to ""get the fuck out of the shower."" It's a long story, but I believe did little or nothing wrong.


So, my wife and I have been together for 8 years or so.  We have a new baby together.  I believe I am a good stepfather to my stepson, who I'll call Chris.  I had an abusive stepfather who was very unfair to me, so I am very careful in how I treat Chris.  If anything, I am probably way too lenient and allow his mother to mainly set structure since I am leery of becoming the ""evil stepfather.""  We get along great, though.

The last couple years Chris has started doing this very annoying thing that has caused a lot of problems in the household: he takes absurdly long showers.  He will sometimes shower for two hours.  He's a teenage boy.  I'm sure you can guess what he's probably actually doing in there.  Still, it's incredibly wasteful water-wise and I haven't really liked it, but my wife has not wanted to push the issue so I have mostly looked the other way.  But it has caused to have to rush around on more than one occasion.

But there has been a bigger recurring problem with the showers. 

I work third shift.  It's not ideal and I don't like it, but it's necessary for the moment because we have a new baby and it allows me to be around in the morning to take care of the baby while my wife works.  Which means I wake up in the evening, eat some dinner, take a shower and go to work.  I have to be at work at 10pm. I shower at 9pm, which gives me enough time to get ready and make my commute by 9.

Chris likes to shower in the evening.  This would not be a problem if he would take a ten minute shower like a normal human being.  But very often, I will get up around 8:30-9pm and find that Chris has been in the shower for an hour or two.  The hot water tank is long empty by this point and it takes a good twenty minutes to a half hour to heat back up.

It is *infuriating* to wake up and have to take a cold shower.

I've talked to my wife and Chris about this a million times.  I've told them it's fine if Chris wants to shower in the evening, but he either needs to be out of the shower by 8:30 at the absolute latest, wait until 9:15 when I'm out of the bathroom, or learn to take a ten minute shower.  I don't feel like any of this is unreasonable.

Yet, at least once a week, I am stuck trying to rush Chris out of the bathroom multiple times, only to be told, ""I'll be out in a minute!""  I have been late, I have taken cold showers, etc.  I am *so* over it.  I have tried being nice.  I have begged my wife and Chris.  I have tried.  Really.  I have.

Tonight, at 8:45 pm, I was sitting there eating dinner when I heard the bathroom shower start running.  From dealing with this a million times before, I knew I needed to deal with this immediately.  I knocked on the door and Chris told me he was just going to take a quick shower.  I told him he *had* to be out in ten minutes or I was going to late for work.  He said okay.

8:55 pm rolls around.  He's still showering.  I knock again.  He says the usual, ""I'll be out in a minute."" Which can mean anything from five minutes to half an hour.

9:00 pm rolls around.  He's still showering.  I knock again.  ""I'll be out in a minute.""

And I just lost my temper.  I said, firmly (but did not yell), ""No, get the *fuck* out of the shower, *now.* I am going to be late for work.""

And wouldn't you know it?  He shut the water off and got out of the shower.

And my wife came unglued.  How dare I talk to Chris that way?  You should *never* talk to a child that way!  Etc.

I would like to point out also, that our household is pretty casual about swearing.  It's not like my son has never heard the F word before and it's not like I personally insulted him, nor does my wife have some big thing against swearing.  It was an adjective.  I can honestly say if this had been my own biological son I would've handled it exactly the same way.  And actually, I wouldn't have needed to, because I would've put a stop to this *way* before now.

She is fucking furious, telling me I crossed a line, etc.  She is acting like I hit him or verbally abused him or something.

Maybe I'm wrong, but I don't think I did anything wrong.  I have been dealing with this shit, cold showers, being late for work, for two years and I've been a bit of a doormat about it and tried to be nice and nothing has worked.  But my wife is so insistent that it has me questioning myself.

Did I really do anything wrong here?

tl;dr -- I got firm with my stepson after two years of cold showers and being late for work.  Wife is furious, but I don't think I did anything wrong."
"I'm pregnant, and my [28F] parents [55F, 60M] have no respect for my choices as a new parent. I don't know how to manage them.


So I never thought my pregnancy would be this stressful due to my own parents. I'm currently 31 weeks along, so baby is coming in the next few months.

To summarize, my mom and dad are divorced. My dad remarried some years ago; his wife has 3 kids, and all 3 of those kids have their own children now, so he is around tiny kids a lot at the moment. My mom has been dating a guy for a few years but never remarried. I have separate issues with both of them in regards to my baby, but they are both just... not... respecting my requests or decisions or anything. They act like they know better. This is their first grandchild, and I am their only child. They live 7 hours away by car.

I am extremely close with both parents and have good relationships with both of them. We talk on the phone several times a week. Before anyone suggests it, no, I'm not going no contact with either parent over this. It's out of the question.

With my mom.... She's very excited for the baby. Overly excited. Grandma-nightmare territory. She's spent hundreds (maybe thousands?) of dollars on the baby and my baby shower that is happening in a few weeks. The baby shower only has around 10 people coming, but she's going nuts buying things for it even though I keep asking her to keep it small and personal. I didn't want a big baby shower. Whatever. I'm willing to let it slide. She likes talking about the baby. Anytime I learn new information about labor or taking care of our baby and talk to her about it, she tends to scoff and not take it seriously. She seems to think her 30 year old information &gt; anything I learn now. She makes condescending comments like, ""It's a miracle you survived!""

She's told me many old wive's tales about pregnant/babies that I have asked my doctors about and was told they are false. Relaying this information to her results in scoffing about how my doctors are wrong. My mom is planning on driving to see me when I go into labor, which I am fine with, as I established early on she is not coming in the delivery room and she has accepted this. But she wants to 'come help'. I'm fine with that. I talked to her last night about how she can help - cooking, maybe, or just helping me clean a bit, and she acted disinterested and said, ""Cook? What am I going to cook? Aren't you making freezer meals?"" I don't know what she's thinking is going to happen when she's here after the birth to 'help'.

My dad is going to come visit a few weeks after the baby is born, once my mom is gone (they are not on speaking terms). He loves a certain restaurant in my city, and he suggested we go out to said restaurant... 2 weeks after the birth of my baby. I told him I don't know if we can manage that, and he was pretty pushy/insistent that my baby ""needs exposure to germs"" and that it will be fine if we go. I told him I'm concerned for the other patrons, as I don't want their experience ruined by a screaming baby. I left it at ""we will see"". His wife is a smoker, and I told him if she comes with him to see the newborn, I need her to practice some safe hygiene to ensure the second hand smoke does not get on my newborn. He said he would talk to her about it, but I feel like she's more headstrong and will put up a fuss. His wife has also criticized me during my pregnancy because I am avoiding hot baths, as I heard raising your body temperature can be very bad for baby, and I was told that she bathed during pregnancy and her 3 kids turned out just fine! (Well, no, they didn't actually, but that's another post entirely.)

My biggest issue with BOTH parents... I can't even believe I'm typing this.... VACCINES. I have begged both of them to please make sure they are up to date on their vaccines due to the measles scare. I have asked them to please get a flu shot this fall if they are going to visit during flu season. They have both argued with me on this. My mom is insistent she's just fine, she's never had a flu shot in her life, and she had measles as a kid so she's immune anyway.... OK fine. Get your flu shot. My dad? Oh god, he's right on the anti-vax BS, even telling me that ""children die from getting vaccines every year"". He's anti-doctor and anti-vax. I'm pretty sure he had vaccines as a child, but I don't know which ones. ALSO his step kids I mentioned earlier, you know how they all have little ones? Well, a few of those kids are not vaccinated. The kids are not supposed to be visiting my newborn, but it makes me all the more paranoid about my dad and his wife being hygienic and safe to be around my baby.

I've tried and tried to talk to them about these things. I feel like I'm getting railroaded. Honestly it's causing me so much stress, I feel like crying, I feel like I'm going to be a mom soon and I have no control over the situation so therefore I'm going to be a shit mom. When my husband and I took a prenatal course, they asked what our biggest fears as parents are (we were separated, dads went to one room). When I saw the list on the board, I had contributed ""vaccines/safety"", and I knew immediately which one my husband had contributed - ""managing family/friends"". Because they have been the biggest cause of stress and anxiety during this whole pregnancy.

I seriously just don't know what to do anymore. Short of putting down my foot and saying, ""You're not coming to see the baby unless you get this flu vaccine in the fall"" which just cause MORE DRAMA that I don't have the capacity to deal with right now. I have a freaking newborn on the way. And the utter disrespect for my choices as a parent.... I feel like they don't view me as a parent or respect me as a person who will soon be responsible for a baby. I don't know how to talk to them about this. I feel like I've tried wording it different ways, I've tried kindness and tough love, and I don't know what the hell else I can do with them. I love my parents. I won't cut them off from their grandbaby. But I need them to listen to me and respect my choices. How do I get this point across???

tl;dr Parents have no respect for me as a new parent, completely ignoring my requests regarding their visiting the newborn. Have attempted to talk to them about it in the past, resulting in resistance/arguing. How do I get it through their skulls that I need them to do what I say because it's MY BABY?"
"My boss [50s m] sent me [22f] a very creepy text, I responded angrier than I should have


I work at an engineering company. I left my previous job because I was harassed by a superior, and HR didn’t help, and most of my coworkers there sided with the guy who harassed me. So I admit that kind of thing is a sore spot for me. 

But I got my current job, got out of there, and thought everything was better for a while. My team at my current job and I all have each other’s phone numbers to coordinate the occasional work travel but that hasn’t caused any problems so far. My boss, I’ll call him Daniel, had sent me complements over text before but they never seemed to cross a line, they were all about my work, my work ethic, my accomplishments, etc.

———

Yesterday night, I was just having a really bad night. I’d accidentally ran into someone from my old job, when my friends and I were out drinking, and that got me thinking about how angry I was about how things ended with that old job. I took a pay cut just to get away, I alsolost out on 10 thousand dollars of my 401K match because I left too early, and the last few months before I left had just been really awful on me emotionally. It caused me to damage some friendships because I was too drained to spend time with my friends, and I cancelled on people more than I should have.

Once I started dwelling on that old pain, I decided to stop drinking and just go home because I knew no good would come of continuing to drink when I was in a sour mood. So I called an Uber for myself.

———

When I was in the Uber, I got a text from my current boss Daniel, he was calling me beautiful, that he adored my body, saying he couldn’t get his mind off me, said he could tell I felt similarly. 

(WTF NO)

That was so out of the blue and unwanted for me. Plus, I was already in a sour mood about having been harassed out of my past job. So I kinda spiralled mentally. Thinking “Not again, I just left a place because of this bullshit, I can’t believe this is happening again, fuck you.’ I guess my anger at how stuff ended at my last job compounded with my anger at having gotten that text from my boss, and my fear that I’d go through the same thing again…

I was so panicked that I was shaking all over and was having trouble typing, but I managed to slowly type out “go to hell you wrinkly c\*\*\*, don’ you ever text me again, don’t you ever fucking think for one minute that you can put your hands on me, or even fucking look at me the wrong way. if you try shit at work i will defend my self with everything i have” I felt really good for the first few seconds after I sent it, I’d regretted not standing up for myself more at my last job so it felt so good to get my uncensored thoughts out. But then it hit me how I may have majorly fucked up. And then I blocked my boss’s number. 

I don’t know if Daniel sent me anything more after that because I haven’t unblocked him.

I went home and decided to just go to bed and not say or do anything more I might regret until I’d slept and sobered up. And now it’s the next day, and I’m stressed as hell.

On one hand, I think I ought have done the “right thing” and gone straight to HR, and that I royally fucked up for speaking for myself so angrily. But on the other hand I don’t really trust HR departments to handle shit anymore, and I’m thinking maybe there’s a chance I’ve resolved stuff for good all on my own So… I’d really like some advice. What do I do at work on Monday? Damage control somehow, or just walk in there with my head held high and rise above all this?

tl;dr - My boss sent me a creepy message, I sent a very angry one back. What do I need to do on Monday to save my job? "
"Should I (F26) tell my boyfriend (24) that his best friend said I deserve better?


Last night I was at the bar with my bf. Around midnight my bf's bestfriend comes up and starts talking with me while I'm standing right next to my bf. 

He tells me he's so sorry for how my bf treated me last weekend backstory: My bf invited me over and spur of the moment we decide to see who is in the bar. I don't feel like socializing since I just got done with parent-teacher conferences all week. I just want to go home and watch a movie. I tell my bf this and he said he wants to talk to a couple people and then he'll meet me at his house. I go to his house and put on a movie and fall asleep. I woke up at 1am and he is still not home and I left the bar at 8:40. I got pissed and left. My bf later apologized for it and said it was a very shitty thing to do.

Anyway, my bfs best friend said he should have never treated me like that. I deserve so much better than that and I had every right to be angry and he is angry at him for that. And bf isn't even talking with us or even all night. Which is what bf does everytime we go to the bar. He talks with everyone for hours without saying a word to me during that time.

Best friend's friend Pat comes over and starts talking with us. Pat is a middle aged man. I turned to try and join the conversation my bf was having with two 30 something year old women but I overhear best friend and Pat talking about me and bf. They were saying how did bf get a girl like me. I don't deserve a man like that, I deserve so much better because look, he's talking to two women instead of his girlfriend.

Pat taps me on the shoulder and says ""I have something very important I think you should hear and I don't want to come across as creepy so just hear me out. You are very beautiful and you deserve to be treated very well. If I had a girlfriend as beautiful as you, I would treat her like a queen. I would have her at my side and the whole bar would know because i would want to show her off. Not like him over there who hasn't spoken to you all night. You deserve better than that. Remember to respect yourself. That's all I have to say. There are guys who would treat you a whole lot better than how you're being treated right now."" I couldn't get a word in afterwards plus I was high and drunk. 

Later that night I overheard Pat and best friend talking about me AGAIN. Pat: "" shes very beautiful and she's your end goal?: best friend ""I hope so. I would really like that"" Pat ""well I hope so, shes a very nice girl and she deserves better"" And all this was spoken right next to my bf. Who had no idea because he was too deep in conversation with the two women. 

I trust my bf. He was being friendly with the two women and was talking about the summer festival. He wasn't hitting on them at all nor do I have any reason to believe that he would.

Other than in bars he has been very good to me but with a few faults. We've been dating for 6 months now.

TL;DR went to bar with bf and bf talked with everyone else but me all night. Bf's best friend and his friend said I deserve better. Overheard best friend saying he wants to be with me. All while standing right next to bf.

Should I tell my bf? Should I ignore it??"

So I noticed my cousin was affectionate and flirting with this boy during a neighborhood party last weekend. I don't think there's any good reason for a 14 year old to be flirting with a 20 year old. I don't even think there's a good reason for them to talk to each other like that, so I interfered. I just went there and told my cousin that her mom was looking for her, took her to my aunt and uncle, told them what happened and they asked me to take her home.

I took her some advice, told her that it's not appropriate or safe for her to be talking to boys that are that much older than her. She said she likes talking to boys and I told her that she should just hang out with boys who are her own age, that's fine. She seemed to understand it, I'm sure my uncle and aunt will give her the same advice.

Once I was back to the party, I told my girlfriend what happened. Earlier today, she came to me and accused me of overstepping my bounds and being controlling towards my cousin, saying I'm ""baby""ing her and she should make her own decisions. I don't agree with this mindset, I think I was just looking out for her and it was for her own good. She's 14 and can be stupid (like I was at that age). Girlfriend believes I have no rights to make that judgement.

She has demanded that I apologize to my cousin and promise her that this will not happen again, and I really can't make that promise nor am I going to apologize, because I don't think I did anything wrong and I'd do it again.

Relationship length is 8 months.

Was I really wrong and out of line here?

TLDR: I stopped my 14 year old cousin from flirting with a 20 year old boy and took her to her parents, girlfriend thinks I overstepped and should apologize. Was I wrong?"
"UPDATE: bf (31m) still using webcam girls despite promising not to. Asks me (31f) for money because he couldn’t pay for it


UPDATE from previous post, original link here:

https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/apyk7j/boyfriend_wont_have_sex_with_me_but_regularly_has/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app


Short version of previous post - bf doesn’t want sex with me due to ‘anxiety’ but frequently visits webcam girls .

TLDR at the end.

After bf had registered for sessions with a sex psychotherapist, and him making an effort it seemed that things were getting better.

Yesterday I found out that he spent over £100 on cam girls in the last week.
He saw how distraught I was after the last time and we nearly broke up, but he just can’t seem to stop.
He also went overdrawn because of this and had the audacity to ask me for money. I essentially paid for him to cheat on me.

I don’t think that we can get back from this.

TLDR: bf promises that he won’t use webcam girls again. He does and asked me for money because he couldn’t pay for it without telling me what it was for."
"Me [23 F] with my entire family. I've been disowned for ending my relationship.


I'm not sure what I'm looking for here. I feel like I'm in the twilight zone. I chose to end my relationship and call of my engagement a few months ago. He was a good person and the break up wasn't really ugly or anything. We had been living apart for the better part of a year for school and I realized I wasn't in love anymore. I wanted to live independently and focus on my schooling and making friends. And that was that. 

I expected my family to be a little shaken over the breakup because on the outside, things looked great to them. He was very committed and successful and we were set to live a very comfortable life together - a big house and high-paying jobs. I did not expect them to act the way they have been and I guess I'm looking for words of wisdom from anyone who's been through something similar. 

None of my siblings will speak to me. My aunts and uncles have all messaged me saying how hard it is to see us break up and that they hope my ex is doing well. My mom started off by saying that maybe I need to adjust my anxiety medication, and I'll realize how big of a mistake it was to leave him. She then went on to say that I'm cruel for doing this to him. She's stopped talking to me as well, and has actually been consoling my ex and having him over to the house. My father initially told me that it was just a phase and I would come to my senses. 

Yesterday, my father posted on an event page for our family reunion that unless my ex is going, he will not show up. About 7 other family members piggy-backed on this, saying that he is invited and they all want to see him. I responded to this by saying that no, he isn't invited and that's that. A few members shot back by saying how cold and insensitive I am. Now, I'm uninvited to the family reunion and my father will not speak to me. 

What the heck, guys? I've been sobbing about this a lot. I have a mostly good relationship with my family, or so I thought. I just don't even know what to do here. Is there anything I can do to remedy this?

TL;DR: I ended my engagement and my family is making me feel like garbage about it. "
"I (30M) married my high school sweet heart(29F), but my Indian parent bailed


So, I write this today, finally after 6 months because I recognize the emotional pain I am facing. Its not over whelming, however it is affecting me. 

Lets back track a bit. 

I met my high school girl friend after many years and we hit it off. For back ground, we are both first generation immigrants who moved to North America pretty young. I first met my now wife in 11th grade. We dated and broke up. A typical high school relationship. 

I met her again in 2015. We were now weathered older people (:D) . We hit it off almost immediately like friends who were never apart.  I told my parents about her, but caste and status seemed to be an issue with them. They never mentioned it directly. But their issue was apparent. 

I waited patiently and tried to get them on board with the plan. Finally at the end of 2017, I proposed to her without their support. They immediately proceeded to completely kick me out of their life. We got married in India, with the support of her parents at the end of 2018 (My parents, and grand parents didn't show. Some of my uncles and cousins did show) and live a happy life in Toronto.   


Now, the issue. I started getting night mares about my parents recently. I wake up in cold sweats in the middle of the night. I wake up swinging punches because i dream of a fight with my dad. 

I never had a deep relationship with my parents. I lived away from them in boarding school or university for most of my life. But i never thought I could be disowned by them. I do not regret any of my choices. I do not think I have any closure regarding my parents behavior.   


I am not even sure why I am posting this. Maybe I just needed a place to vent and see if i could organize my thoughts. I love my wife, and the life I lead is boss AF. I just want to do her justice and loose the luggage. 

&amp;#x200B;

 Tl;dr:  Indian Parents excommunicated me. I think my subconscious mind is fucking with me."
"My (f28) Boyfriend (m28) of 10 years caught cheating. What now?


Hi everyone. Any insight would help. I’m so lost.

Tl;dr: bf of 10 years caught cheating for the past 1.5 years with another girl. He wants to fix things with us and has given me access to all his accounts, sharing location, honest details of the affair, etc. Has this ever worked for anyone? 

I caught them in the room one day that I came home early. He says she was someone he had been having sex with and likes but that this secret was “killing him” and he ultimately wanted to break it off and did for some time then somehow began to hook up again. He “got himself in a hole during a time we were bad and he couldn’t get out of it.” I think it’s a cowardly excuse. I appreciate his effort to mend things with us and bc I was so blind sided by it all idk what to do. I adored tf out of him. I loved our relationship. Just a day before I was curled up with him wondering how I got so lucky. Now my whole life is upside down. Has anyone ever stayed with their partner after an affair when they took all the right steps to gain your trust back? Did it work? "
"UPDATE: My boyfriend (33m) came clean to me (27f) about lying about his whole life


https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/alj9ui/my_boyfriend_33m_came_clean_to_lying_to_me_27f/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app


Hey r/relationships. This is an update on the post that I made a couple of months ago. Basically my boyfriend had lied to me about his job and education (made the whole thing up). he had told me that he was in a PhD program and that he had a job as a researcher at a university. I found out that he had no job and that he wasn’t in a PhD program. He later confessed to me that he had dropped out of college in his last year at undergrad. When I made the post, I still thought that he had his bachelors degree but he cleared that up for me a couple of days after and showed me his transcripts. I wanted to know if we could still make it work after he told me the truth.


A lot of the people who commented said that this situation reminded them of the podcast Dirty John and encouraged me to listen to it (I did and it’s excellent. And I did see some parallels).


Anyway since this happened, I told him that he had to get himself a job if he wanted to be with me, so he got an office job. It’s full time. I’ve seen his employment paperwork and I’ve met his coworkers. He is not a scammer. He lied to me because he was lonely, and the last time he was “on the grid” was during his last serious relationship a few years ago. 


I didn’t see much need to write about other aspects of our relationship before, but it is the best relationship I have been in. It has been over for months now and he is so sweet and kind to me. Ever since I found out the truth, there is no weirdness between us and we have been happy together.


I know that a lot of people on here were saying that I needed to dump him, especially because I have a young daughter, so I know that I might be opening myself up to some negative comments. But I did promise an update. My parents have stopped talking to me over this, but they have done this many times in my life (including when I married my ex and when I got pregnant with my daughter). I’m about to graduate from law school, and I have good employment prospects. I am in therapy, and my therapist said that I am making good healthy choices (I told her everything).


So I don’t need your approval and I doubt I’m getting it but I wanted to let you all know that for what it’s worth, not all liars are abusive assholes. Some are just afraid that they aren’t good enough, and need someone to show them that they are. 


TL;DR we stayed together. He got a job. I have hung up my detective hat, and we are very happy together.

"My (29M) parents (~60MF) seem to favor my twin brother (29M) over myself and I don't know how to react.


I have a twin brother, which I can honestly say it has been good and bad as I've grown up. When we got out of college, I went to get a master's degree and my brother went into a post Bach program for a medical field, but he moved away from the state we grew up in. Since he has moved away, it's always felt rough to me because even though I get to spend more time with my parents since we are in the same area, they always talk about him when I'm around and it makes me feel less than adequate. To the point where when I see them once a month or so, they always bring up ""we should FaceTime your brother"", even though I don't see them a lot.

So my brother met his now wife in school, then moved to her state once they both finished their medical programs. The wedding was a bit tense, as my Mom didn't really get along great with my brother's wife or her Mom. But after the wedding, they established themselves in his wife's home state and recently bought a house. We all visit them once in a while when we can, but it's not easy because of the distance.

I haven't always had a great relationship with my parents, especially after my brother left. But recently I thought it was okay and I was trying to spend more time with them and help them out when I could, and I was looking forward to spending my birthday with them as it's coming up and I'm turning the big 3-0. I was talking to my brother today, and he told me that they had bought tickets to visit him over our birthday weekend, and it caught me off guard. On the one hand, I want them to be able to see him and spend his birthday with them, but at the same time they didn't say anything to me and it hurts a lot. I haven't spelled out the whole background with my parents here, but I've had multiple conversations with them about how I sometimes feel valued less than my brother because of their actions, and they mostly have responded negativey and told me I'm being too sensitive.

Writing this out I feel like I'm just whining a lot, ""my parents don't love me as much as my twin brother,"" but I really have felt like I have put so much effort into my relationship with my parents and trying to be there for them and help them when they ask for help, where as my brother has always done his own thing and they seem to cater to him. It's been seriously hurting my self esteem, and making me want to step back slightly from my relationship with my parents. I don't think I can talk to them about this, because of how they've responded before. I'm not sure if I'm asking for advice, or more just writing this down to see how it feels when I read this back, but I any advice would be appreciated. Thanks. 

tl;dr:

I have a twin brother who lives out of state, and I feel like my parents favor him more than me sometimes. Recently they booked a trip to see him during our 30th birthday without telling me, and it feels like it's the last straw. Not sure how to respond."
"My (23/M) girlfriend's (20/F) best friend (20/F) is dating a 15/M and it is emotionally affecting me.


So my girlfriend's best friend has a boyfriend of one year that she met online. It is completely online only since they live in different states (this is the United States by the way). This was fine because I first assumed this guy was 18 or something while my girlfriend's best friend just barely turned 20 and started college. But when I was driving my girlfriend's best friend (lets call her P) she talked to me about him and she told me that he barely started high school and was 15. This just makes me enraged. I shouldn't even care. But it got so bad that I have had two fights about it with my girlfriend. Although my girlfriend knows this is wrong and gross, she still supports P because ""it's my best friend"" and she ""doesn't want to choose sides"". Every time P is mentioned, my skin crawls. I've talked to P as civil as I can and she said a lot of things a lot of creepy people and even some child daters say like ""He is mature for his age."" or ""Age is just a number."" or ""You wouldn't understand our love."" and it's just disgusting. I've talked to my psychologist and psychiatrist about it since I have OCD and generalized anxiety. They agree with me. But I just feel like I have to do something when I know there isn't anything I can do. I also feel like that if she stops dating this kid, I don't know if I can be friends with P again. Literally the only ""legit"" reason she didn't break up with him after knowing his real age is because ""he doesn't want to sleep with me."" Of course he doesn't because he can't! It's illegal to do so! I asked if P can date around her college but P says that she only gets guys who want to sleep with her only. Lastly, she said ""I hope you can realize that this is just meant to be."" after I told her I don't want to hear about it anymore. I was advised to ignore her in which I am doing but every saturday she is in a Dungeons and Dragons group with my friends and girlfriends.

&amp;#x200B;

Is there anything I can do? Even if it is just for the sake of keeping myself emotionally in check?

"my ex (F18) and her friend will not stop contacting me (M20) after we have broken up. i have blocked their numbers, but they still find a way; is there anything i can do?


hi. this is really long, but i want to provide as many details as possible to the entire story. there is a tldr at the end for the barebones, but this is essentially my entire story here. 

so we were together for around 4ish months. met through a mutual friend and clicked pretty quickly, so we began dating pretty much instantly. about a month after we began dating, she went away to school — this didn’t come out of nowhere; we both went into the relationship knowing this would happen and being okay with it, just to see where we went. the first few weeks of long distance were difficult, but shortly after we fell into a real nice groove of facetiming every night while doing homework and open communication and just really really good overall. 

the problems started around the time she was returning home for a family reason. she got home on a friday, ignored me all day saturday and then went out to a bar and then a party with her friends. i should also mention here that we were “best friends” on snapchat for essentially our entire relationship leading up to this point, but a few days beforehand we no longer were. i asked her about it, and she mentioned it was this guy who was just a good friend. i didn’t want to start anything, but needless to say i was slightly suspicious already. i didn’t care she went out, i get it and she hadn’t seen her friends in just as long as she hadn’t seen me. ignoring me was less cool though. i should also mention right here that despite her essentially ignoring me all day, i told her that if any of her plans for where to stay (her best friends dorm room) fell through, to let me know bc i could pick them up or whatever. the next day the location on her phone was turned off when i woke up (we both always shared our location with each other). and yes, i did feel the need to check given that this dude was apparently now her best friend on snap. she offered up that she turned off her location for everyone so her mom didn’t think that she wasn’t at her friends house or something to that effect. i was iffy but relatively okay with this.

we hung out pretty much everyday the entire next week, and it was honestly really great. everything felt normal and good and like nothing had ever happened and like we were just really really good together. this was the pinnacle of our relationship, for sure, and the next few weeks were really great as well. 

then we began kinda planning out when she was coming home next, which was thanksgiving. we talked about me picking up from airport, or whatever. she began saying stuff about how she needed to talk to me then and stuff. so i was pushed a little bit because i wanted to know. she eventually caved and talked. that night, the guy that was a “friend” was at the bar and then her plans on where to stay fell through. rather than calling me, this guy offered that she and her friends could stay at his place; she accepted and slept in his bed. she insisted that nothing happened, but it plus the lying about it was enough for me. i pretty much broke up with her. after a few days of her apologizing and insisting nothing happened, i said like look let’s just talk in person when you come home. she agreed.

then she came home and i was available every single day to hang out and talk, and she had plans every single day and couldn’t. so i said fine, we won’t ever figure this out and it’s just officially over and she again apologizing and begged us to meet over christmas break. i said if i want to meet with you and talk, then i will. otherwise, you need to leave me alone.

it was around this time i tried to move on. had a one nighter, felt like shit about it, cried a lot because i was lonely and no one was her. i called her the day before she was set to come home and said we could talk. we did, and i expressed that i was willing to move on and move forward because i loved her. she said this made her realize that she needed to grow up and she was ready for that. we made up. it wasn’t the same, but i hoped it would be eventually. 

new year’s eve she went out again even though i wasn’t thrilled about it and i told her that. she said that she wanted this to be her chance to prove to me that she had grown up. i was heading to a separate party, because i wasn’t invited out with her. she essentially ignored me all night again, and posted pictures of her all over a few guys on her snap story. i got wasted to the point of throwing up multiple times and crying on a couple friends immediately after the vomiting. 

she expressed to me the next day that nothing happened. she explained the pictures as nothing. told me she wanted me to come over and meet her parents so she could show me she was all in (had not yet met parents...also was in no shape to meet parents, as my head felt like i had a constant stream of hammer strikes to the temple). i told her no. that i was done with everything. 

around this time she got vengeful. she sent me pics/vids of her doing drugs or buying a pregnancy test, because she fucked her ex-boyfriend. i followed by blocking her on snap and all social media. she called me on my birthday, right before she went back to school following winter break, and kept on telling me how excited she was to fuck her ex that night and hang with friends that “your controlling ass never let me hang with” which was bullshit. the next day, after i blocked her number, she messaged me on social media that i guess i forgot to block her on telling me she was sorry for doing that on my birthday, and she wishes me well and wishes no hard feelings. i told her there are hard feelings and to leave me the fuck alone. 

i have her and her friend blocked on anything that they could contact me on, except for her friend’s phone number because i did not even have it saved. 

which leads to this last weekend, about a month later with essentially no interaction, when i was on spring break vacation with some friends. we went to a club one night and as soon as we walk in, i get a call from her friend, and i know it because it’s the same number as my ex’s until the last 2 digits. i decline the call, and she calls again and i answer and tell her to fuck off and stop calling me; i could not even hear her because i was in a loud club. after that call, i block her number. she calls again from “no caller i’d”; supposedly, if you use *67 and then type in the number, it will not recognize it’s blocked and allow you through. i declined the call again. after the night ends at the club, we head back to our hotel. i won’t lie — there may have been a girl at the club that we made out, no big deal, at least it shouldn’t have been. 

the minute i walk back into the hotel room and lay down in bed, still drunk as shit, i get a no caller id call. i answer and it’s my ex. asking me what happened. i told her her friend kept calling me and they both needed to fuck off and leave me alone. she said she was calling me because i called her first and she didn’t know who it was; i checked my call log, because i was drunk but i didn’t even have her number saved, so it’s literally impossible i could have called it. she called me first. she wouldn’t divert from that bullshit explanation, even when i called her on it. i told her they both needed to leave me the fuck alone. she had the audacity to ask how i’m doing, whether i’m okay, because i sounded not good. i wasn’t good; i wasn’t in the mental state to be having this conversation, because it’s literally just now where i’m actually feeling okay. this was one of the first weekends i felt okay and like i maybe deserve to have a love better than hers. and it was ruined and i feel like i’m back to square one. 

i felt bad about kissing someone else at the club, even though i shouldn’t have, but i heard her voice for the first time in a long time and i felt like she was my only home and comfort. i felt like shit all around. i still do, and i still feel like i don’t when i’ll ever get over her and how i was hurt. most of all, how the fuck do i get her and her friend to stop contacting me when i’ve blocked them on everything? i have no idea where to go next. 

tldr: girlfriend probably cheated on me. broke up. blocked her. her and her friend are still contacting me and ruining my attempted progress on getting over her, even after blocking them on everything. "
"My boyfriend (28M) is mostly unemployed but thinks he's better than me (24F) employed.


My boyfriend (28M) of 1 year has been in university for nearly 10 years. He finished his bachelor's and started his PhD but dropped out a few years after. He's currently mostly unemployed (works at uni for a 4 hours each week) and has no professional career lined up. He refuses to apply for any other jobs outside his degree and usually just sits at home watching movies or playing games.

I'm (24F) and graduated with a bachelor's degree 3 years ago. I have over a year's experience working in my degree but decided to quit my job because it was destroying my mental health (workplace harassment and boss refusing to pay). I wanted a break from ""using my brain"" and decided to work in retail for a few months full time just to clear my mind but still earn enough to provide.

My boyfriend has gone off at me multiple times saying that I'm slacking off and not working hard. He also keeps degrading me telling me I'm not smart like him and the only reason he's unemployed is because he has high standards and won't do ""common jobs"" like retail. I'm working 50 hour weeks whilst he does 4 hours supervising university students and he always complains I'm not making time for him since I'm working. He knows my shift hours, so when I'm not working I always make time for him, but he's off doing his own recreational activities whenever I'm free even though I feel like he should be the one to adjust his minimal schedule for me. We end up arguing all the time over this.

Thoughts? I guess I'd like to hear an opposing opinion from a guys point of view.

tl;dr boyfriend unemployed has nothing to do but puts me down because he thinks he's better than me"
"Wife (35F) has been emotionally abusing me (36M) for years and I never realized it until recently


The title is really the TLDR. I don't know where else to turn to right now. As a warning this could turn into a long one.

We've married for over 10 years and have a young daughter who I love to the end of the world. I'm also the sole breadwinner in the family as my wife is disabled.

About a year ago we started couple's therapy and it seemed to go well.  She had started accusing me of being emotionally abusive and I was confused as I never intended to hurt her emotionally or control her in any way but I believed her and entered therapy thinking I was doing something unintentional and wanted to stop. The first therapist was only available to us for 12 sessions and, like I said, it went well. On reflection I think this may have been because I took the approach going in that I was the abusive one albeit unintentionally. What I should have recognized as a sign that it was actually reversed was that even in therapy sessions I was to nervous to bring up the ways that she has hurt me. Also, as I've learned later, the abuser is usually the first to accuse and the victim is completely confused about what is going on.

I don't want to go into all details but most of are arguments mainly consisted of me apologizing to her for every perceived insult and slight. At this point I truly feel I have no friends; I haven't seen anyone socially in over 2 years. Any time I've had plans to see a friend something happens that is inevitably my fault and I end up cancelling at the last minute. I don't even respond to texts any more because I know it will just end with me having to say no to any invitations.  She even tried to cancel Christmas with my family 2 hours before heading over and later suggested we never see them on holidays going forward. I get blamed for everything and I'm not allowed to make mistakes. In her mind sheis blameless in the marriage problems. She has also threatened to leave me more times than I can count and had threatened to take our daughter away.

A few months later we were back with another therapist we chose together. It didn't really start well because she didn't feel safe in therapy so at the suggestion of therapist #2 we met with with her individually. I felt I was getting a benefit from seeing therapist #2 and started seeing the behaviors from my wife towards me that were abusive. Therapist #2 also communicated to me that I am not an abuser. The way she explained it is that everyone in every relationship will commit abusive behaviors at some point but that this alone does not make you an abuser. She had this conversation with my wife as well, not even saying that my wife is abusive, and my wife fired her. Her started reason read that therapist #2 wasn't being honest but it appears the reason is that therapist #2 didn't tell her what she wanted to hear. I still see therapist #2 individually. I also started seeing a psychologist for a chronic neurological condition around this time.  I'm so eternally grateful to both of them.

About a month after therapist #2 was fired, therapist #1 recommended an excellent therapist for us to see together. My psychologist knows her well and had told me she is truly an excellent and fearless therapist.

Things were going fairly well with therapist #3, after a few sessions my wife said she loved her. Therapist #3 has identified things that I can work on, which I have been. I'm not abusive but I also will never claim to be perfect. Then we had a session where we watched a video on unsafe relationships, it's the only video we've watched in a session. At the end therapist #3 said there may be hurt going in both directions. That based on listening only my wife was the one verbalizing being abused but based on body language that I was the one who looked abused. my wife barely spoke to me the rest of the day. Our next sessions went horribly with my wife barely talking.

A few weeks ago my wife me that she was seeing therapist #3 alone and that she booked another session the following week that either I could go alone or we could go together. My wife cane back from her solo session and said that therapist #3 basically spent the awhile time telling her to leave me. I chose to see therapist #3 alone which my wife looked pissed about when I told her my decision. I had no idea what to expect in my solo session but I knew I had to to her the abusive behaviors that I was suffering. Therapist #2 and my psychologist both encouraged me to do this. I started down this path for a few minutes when therapist #3 told me she knew I was the one being abused and advised that I talk to an attorney just to be ready. She doesn't think my wife will ever accept that she is the abusive one and will fire therapist #3 as soon as it's suggested. The next session went horribly with my wife barely talking and then finally stating that she didn't want to talk because every time she does that therapist #3 and I attack her which is not the case. She booked another solo session with therapist #3 to talk through any issues. Therapist #3 told her that she didn't believe that I'm abusing my wife and was promptly fired. The irony is that my wife said she was firing therapist #3 because she was choosing me over the therapist.

Ever since my first solo appointment I just haven't felt emotionally safe around my wife so I've tried to minimize time together. I had already moved into the guest room at her insistence. The thing is that she had been pressuring me for sex almost constantly and I just don't feel emotionally safe enough to engage in sex given the level of the emotional abuse that is still ongoing. Tonight she started the nightly refunded m tense conversation by among of I realized how long it has been since we've has sex. There is a history of her wanting more sex than I have. I'm realizing now that I didn't feel safe back then and that is why I wasn't interested even though I didn't realize that was the reason why.

She was trying to get me to say why I didn't wasn't to have sex and I told her I wasnt ready to talk about it, which I'm not. She kept pushing and pushing and just not accepting that I'm not ready to talk about it yet. I finally just had to leave the conversation which is not easy as she's very good at pulling me back into conversations I need to leave. Leaving one is how I ended up in the guest room, :f I'm going with this. I gutted it really just feels good to tell someone assuming that anyone read ago the way to the end.  This whole situation just sucks and I don't have friends I can turn to for support.

Thank you to anyone who read to the end. I'm hoping we can work this out but I'm not optimistic. It just feels hopeless to me. It sucks."
"My [29M] fiancee's [32F] family/friends made a decision for her about our wedding day without her say.


Hi all.

I have been with Claire for 8 years and have been engaged since September, looking forward to a spring wedding on the beach in a few weeks. We have a four year old daughter, Rebecca. 

Claire has severe eye problems. She has needed many operations over the years and has worn very strong glasses since she was a baby. Even with her glasses on her eyesight is limited. She can't drive and needs a specially coloured keyboard at work. Without glasses all she can see is a blurred mess, and her eyes can't tolerate contacts. Her vision has been very poor since she was little and has deteriorated considerably over the years, to the point that it's a distinct possibility that she may go completely blind in the future. 

Rebecca unfortunately has the condition too. She also needs strong glasses and her vision is even worse than Claire's was at the same age, so it is a big worry for us. However, we don't let that affect her and she is able to be a happy, active and confident child in spite of her visual impairments. 

Claire works in ophthalmological research, trying to find new treatments for those severe visual impairments. She has learned to accept and to an extent embrace her condition as part of who she is, which is why she's a fantastic role model to our daughter. 

Anyway so Claire went to her mum's place yesterday to do more wedding planning with her mum, her two sisters, my sister and the bridesmaids. When I came to pick her up and took her home, she started to cry. I got her to open up, and apparently during the wedding planning a decision was made without consulting Claire. 

They discussed the dress, hair, makeup etc, but then something else came up. Obviously Claire's dad Karl will be walking her down the aisle. Her mum Nikki said out of the blue that they will need to organise something so that she could get to him ''since obviously you won't have your glasses''. She was shocked and so was I to hear it. Apparently the bridal party have all decided - without consulting Claire - that she isn't going to be wearing the glasses that she needs to see. Apparently a bride with thick glasses looks silly or something. Claire was too shocked and upset to argue but played it cool. She cried her eyes out when she got home and I was fuming. I love and will support Claire no matter what. If she had decided for herself then that is fine. But how could everybody else make such a serious and *insensitive* decision without her say so? 

It's very strange because Claire's mum in particular has been extremely supportive of both her daughter and granddaughter's conditions. At Claire's niece's birthday party Rebecca's glasses came off after she was hit by a ball when the kids were playing outside. She stopped everything so that they could find the glasses and hugged and reassured Rebecca when she was panicking and crying. To go from that to trying to get her own daughter to spend her special day totally blind for vanity's sake is crazy.

I soothed Claire as she cried herself to sleep. I said to her that she should do what she feels is right and she has decided to wear her glasses, since the idea of not seeing my face while she says her vows seems pointless. 

However, how is Claire going to explain/justify this decision to her bridal party without causing arguments?

TL:DR; My fiancee who needs strong glasses was asked not to wear them and go to the ceremony blind. This was upsetting for both of us."
"Cousin [16/M] is given very bad advice from well meaning mom [48/F] and it's ruining high school. Can I [26/M] intervene?


My cousin ""Joe"" is almost 17 and has never had a kiss. He's a tall, gangly kid who is book smart and kind while also a touch naive. He lives with my aunt, who has never remarried after her husband died. Joe is a great kid, he's kind and funny and really nice. He's always thoughtful, uses his intellect for good and will become a great man. The problem is, he is almost entirely ignored by the school, he's just a bit of an outsider. He is passionate about crystals and chemistry and cannot wait to become a chemist. He just doesn't share a lot of the same interest as others in school... except for girls. 

&amp;#x200B;

My aunt coached him on dating and her advice, again, while well meaning, is way, way off the mark. She thinks making a big gesture of affection for a girl is what they want. It has resulted in him being embarrassed in front of the school and has opened him up to be picked on. A girl led him on in the hopes he'd make a gesture, film her turning him down and spread it on social media. Sure enough he fell for the trap. 

&amp;#x200B;

He came to my parent's place for dinner on Friday as he wanted to learn to make bread (my mother's been teaching him). He recounted this and said he did everything his mom said. I bit my tongue, but it's clear my aunt is leading him down the wrong path. She also puts too much emphasis on high school and high school relationships. I was like him - I loved history, social sciences, debate club; I couldn't get enough of reading and scholastic events but failed gym one quarter and BARELY passed the year - despite having an otherwise A average. High school for me was a time I had to get through to get into real life. Joe is the same way. 

&amp;#x200B;

My aunt was super popular and had all the attention. My cousin is more like me. Normally I don't get involved in family things like this, but Joe has another year of high school after this and I don't want him basically suffering for a year because he's trying to do what his mom thinks will work in a quest for a high school relationship that won't last anyway. Would it be really bad to just give him another perspective and get him to selectively disregard his mom's advice?

&amp;#x200B;

tl;dr aunt was popular in high school and gives her awkward/nerdy son bad advice that has made him a target of bullies and social exclusion. Is it okay to go behind her back and give him realistic advice on life/dating and how high school isn't *that* important? "
"My (30F) brother (35M) needs an organ transplant and it's ruining my life, but not in the way that you think.


Before I get started with this post, let me mention that I had originally made this throwaway to post about my dad being a jerk about my wedding a few weeks back, but decided against making a thread. 

&amp;#x200B;

My older brother has always been unhealthy to the point where he probably adjusted to a baseline of feeling crappy, so he didn't end up getting diagnosed with kidney failure until recently when he was hospitalized after losing vision in one of his eyes after a car accident. When he was there, they learned he has abnormally high blood pressure and also as mentioned, kidney failure. 

&amp;#x200B;

I am his only sibling and only family member eligible to donate, if I am a match. Our parents are too old. I work for my father and would be able to take the time off work for surgery easily, as Dad (70M, if it matters) would just do management stuff in my absence. I love my brother and would do absolutely anything to try and save his life.

&amp;#x200B;

My mom (early 60s F) has got the idea in her head that instead of my being tested and offering my organ for transplant, I should drop out and have them test other people instead, so when he needs another kidney in 20-30 years, he can have mine then. The highest probability of a match is me, his sibling. As well, if I drop out now, we don't even know if I am a match. They only test one person at a time, where we are located. S

&amp;#x200B;

My mother's perspective is this: She doesn't feel capable of being a support system to both of us whiles we recover from surgery and would be upset if we both died. 

&amp;#x200B;

I have some objections to that: Regarding the ""support system"" argument - I have a fiance and my own home. If I need a caregiver in my mom's stead, I can reach out to my mother in law, who is retired. If we wait 20-30 years, my mom and my MiL will probably both be dead so maybe I would have even less of a support system. I don't know where I will be or how my business will be being run. I also don't know what health problems might crop up between now and then. Right now I am healthy. I have the ability to take an extended period of time off work. I also feel uncomfortable with the idea that in an undetermined amount of time, I would be called upon to donate my kidney on command, rather than making the choice myself now (again, IF I match). My brother might also have a child or children by that point, who would also have a decent chance of being a match. 

&amp;#x200B;

Thinking about having the opportunity to save my brother's life, NOW, and declining to do it, or having him decline me as a donor (which he is allowed to do) if our mom bullies him into it (which she is capable of doing, he's a mama's boy) makes me so angry I can barely breathe.

&amp;#x200B;

Can someone help me understand her perspective? Am I the one in the wrong here? I'm so angry and so scared that my brother's life is being put at risk because my mom is being so selfish.   


TL;DR: Brother needs organ transplant, mom might try and stand in the way of my donating. Help!"
"Me [20sF] with my work colleagues [20s to 50sF] - they think I'm being abused, but I'm not, and won't believe my explanation.


I [20sF] started a new job about three months ago, and I work in a team of eight other women who are between 27 and 53 years of age. They are really lovely and supportive at work, but like to call the team a family and can get a bit over involved.

I'm more of a private person. I keep my focus on my job and they seem to be happy to accept this. One of my habits is to roll my sleeves up to my elbow when I'm working,  with most of my sleeves being three quarter length, so my forearms are typically on display.

Now  I bruise ridiculously easily. I lean on a button, I bruise. I bang my elbow on the back of a chair, I bruise. I get bruises that I can't explain, and a lot are scattered on my forearms. I also have a bad tempered cat called Bruce, so I sometimes have scratches if I petted him for too long, or if he bit me because I didn't move my arm from the back of the sofa for him to sit there. I get marks elsewhere too, but my forearms are the most visible part of my bruised skin.

They think I have an abusive boyfriend because of the marks, and originally I just laughed it off and told them, truthfully, that I was single and that i just bruise easily. They didn't believe me, and have escalated to ""interventions"" about how I'm a lovely girl who deserves better - it's getting stupid now, and I want it to stop.

How can I get them to either believe me, or accept that I don't want the discussion to continue? I dont want yo have to start wearing long sleeves, as it would just fuel their assumptions.

Tl;dr: my colleagues think I'm in an abusive relationship because they see marks on my arms, how can I tell them to stop with their assumptions?"
"I love a handicapped girl but my parents won't allow me to have a relationship with her


I am 20 years old..I have been studying in this collage near my house for around 2 years and a half ...
Last summer a family came to our Naibourhood and rent this house across our's.

A middle aged man and his wife and 19 years old paraplegics (can't walk ) girl and two boys who still study in school.

We became a close neighbors ..they invited us to dinner several times and so we did.

At one dinner I discovered that they came to our town because this girl (surprise surprise) is going to study in the same college that I am studying in that is 7 miles away from my house.

Once we knew that 
..My dad suggested that I would pick her up to collage since i was driving my own car to collage and everyone agreed ..
The little dad knew that his idea started the flare between me and her ...the flare that he later would want to go away.

Every day we talked when we were going to collage
I knew from her that she had an accident when she was 6 years old which unfortunately made her handicapped...
The thing with this girl that she is extremely beautiful ..short brown hair blue eyes and a smile to steal the heart of the moon ...annnnnd she is really kind and shy ...probably the kindest and shiest person I have ever met in my life.

Really fast we started to become close friends...sometimes after college we would go to restaurant or cinema...
I am pretty certain she started to have a crush on me ...and so did I.

Without me knowing she asked her parents about having a serious relationship with me (around 6 months after they moved) and they were very happy about that ...she told me that they said it is healthy for her to have relationship since she never had a one ..and ofcourse because of her ""special condition"" and apparently I earned their trust as a good polite guy.

I was the happiest person on earth that day and I immediately went to tell my parents and then came the shocking moment.

They completely refused the idea of me having a serious relationship with her.

They told me that they think her family is extremely kind and everything and the girl is sweet and beautiful but her condition may cause me some trouble if We decided to marry later.

I am now very desperate...
I mean I have never met a girl that connects with me the way she does ...it is like she is my soulmate ...
She is still waiting for an answer and i just cannot tell her that..it would break her heart 
What do I do 😥.

TL;DR :this post is about me asking for help in this kind of complicated situation"
"My husband [47M] admitted he never found me [46F] physically attractive


My husband is settling into middle age and got rid of his last trace of youth - his hair. He cut it and dyed it back to its original color. While I always loved his long hair, I think the short hair suits him much better. He doesn't feel the same, however. He regrets cutting it but at the same time he thinks he needed to do it. According to him, having long hair as an older man makes you look ""pathetic"" because your hair starts to recede and thin. He also thinks he's ugly now because his face shows signs of aging. He actually told me that he would understand if I'm no longer attracted to him. I quickly squashed that thought by telling him that I found him sexier than ever. He laughed and said ""well if looks were everything in a relationship, then we wouldn't have been together anyway.""

I agreed at first but then asked him to explain what he meant. That's when he tells me he never found me physically attractive. In fact, he and his friends had given me an unflattering nickname because of how ugly I was back in college. I asked him how the hell did we end up dating and getting married if he found me so unattractive. He said it was because of my personality. We had were partners on a project and hung out a few times which is how he discovered I was an ""amazing person."" We also share about 90% of the same hobbies/interests. He said this more than made up for my lack of physical appeal. I couldn't believe what I was hearing. I got mad and told him to get out. He did. He went to his brother's. He called me later and asked me if I was still mad. I am so we are spending some time apart.

We have been married for 20 years. I know looks aren't everything but I feel so insulted. To hear your lifelong mate say this is such a kick in the face. My self esteem is shot and I feel like I've wasted my life with him. Couldn't I have found someone who would've love both my looks and personality?

TL;DR My husband doesn't find me physically attractive. Only dated me because I have a good personality"
"Gf (28F) is draining me (27M) out. I can't take it anymore


I've been in a long-term relationship with my gf (28M). Lately, I've started to realize being with my gf makes me stressed and anxious. She is too controlling, bossy and I feel very immature. For instance, when I'm going for a walk with her, I'm supposed to walk to the right side, walk in a single pace, carry her bags and my bags, use both the straps of my bag (She wants me carrying my bag in a certain way). She acts I'm embarrassing her in public. She gets pissed easily. In addition, she constantly gives me slaps or pinches me hard. I told her several times it ruins my mood and I feel emotionally drained. The slaps aren't too hard most of the time but the constant blows to my face in public, pulling hair is making me exhausted. Sometimes I've had blue and red marks on my arm. I usually never cry but one time I had to go to the washroom during a date to cry. I'm always the one to visit her, travel 1 hour to see her and she never comes here. She goes like ""your place is too far, I don't like long commutes in bus"". I also realized I feel relieved whenever the date ends and I have to go back home. 

&amp;#x200B;

Whenever I go to her apartment, she is constantly around me to make comments on how I'm supposed to wash dishes in a certain way even though I know how to do it. She makes comments pretty much about everything even though her apartment is a mess and she never cleans. I feel she has no respect for me or my belongings, she spilled something on the bathroom floor and she immediately grabbed my face towel to wipe the floor. I have tried to talk with her but she brushes it off saying ""That's how I show my love, I don't hit hard"". She is even worse when she's on her periods. I have tried telling her she is draining me and making me exhausted but she doesn't seem to make any changes. The only time she seemed apologetic is when she was playing with a knife and accidentally made a cut on my neck (more like a paper cut but there was blood). Her parents like me a lot and they know she is very immature, her mom doesn't know how she treats me yet she told her not to hurt me or be rude to me. I like her parents and I do love her but I feel like I can't continue living like this. 

&amp;#x200B;

tl;dr Gf is very immature and abusive and doesn't realize why I don't want to spend time with her anymore. "
"My (32M) girlfriend (29F) keeps using things I do for my kids as ammo to attack my ex-wife


A little background - I'm 32, have 3 kids with my ex-wife (married 7 years). My girlfriend and I have been dating a hair over 3 years.

Legally my ex and I have 50/50 custody, however I have the kids a bit more than she does. She's not the most responsible person, and by her own admission, she isn't the most maternal person either. She enjoys going out and drinking, partying, etc. We have a good relationship, even though it often times feels like she's another child as opposed to the mother of my kids. Regardless, we have a custody agreement that we both agree on. I make about 3x as much as she does so I'm legally obligated to pay her child support even though we officially have 50/50 custody. I'm totally and 100% ok with that. 

Enter my girlfriend. Everything is going good, we have a great relationship, and the kids love her. She's not a huge fan of my ex, simply because of her lack of parenting skills, but keeps it to herself (and me). 

My biggest irritation in the entire world is how, anytime I do anything for my kids, she has to make some snarky comment(s) about my ex.

Got my daughter a phone for her 10th birthday. 
""Is their mom going to help pay for that?""

Get a call from school, leave work to pick up a sick kid. 
""It just pisses me off how much you do for your kids and how little she does for them""

My son calls me when he's at his mom's to get help with his homework. 
""Can his mom not even handle helping him? Is she that dumb?""

I love helping him with his homework - it's one of our things!

She constantly makes snide comments about how I have them more than she does yet I have to pay child support.

I do the things I do for my kids because I'm their dad, it's my job to take care of them. Why does everything I do always have to be compared to what she *doesn't* do for them? What am I gonna do, tell the school ""sorry, their mom needs to take more responsibility so I will not be picking my son up from school"" like wtf? 

I've brought this up before, about how I don't appreciate her turning everything I do for my kids into an attack on their mom, and if she feels the need to comment on it, maybe shift her thinking to a more positive mindset and tell me how cool it is that I do what I do for my kids. It doesn't seem to sink in.


TL;DR 
My girlfriend compares everything I do for my kids to how little their mom does and I don't see why it matters. They're my kids FFS.

How should I approach this and let her know it's starting to chip away at our relationship? Am I overreacting? Do I need to look at things through her point of view? Any and all advice is welcome and greatly appreciated. "
"My friend [32F] got proposed, I [32F] am upset and SO [34M] feels pressured


I’m feeling pretty lost, so some insights would be pretty helpful!

Me [32F] and my BF [34M] have been together for over 2,5 years, living together for over a year and also have registered our relationship (not married, just the living arrangements for insurance purposes) so we sound like we’re serious.

Since the beginning of the relationship I’ve always been open about what I want, getting married is something beyond important to me. He never made himself clear, but since he never opposed to anything, I thought we were on the same page. 

About 4 months ago I started dropping hints about wedding, didn’t work. So I had an open chat about where we stand in all of this. He didn’t talk much, again, didn’t make himself clear, but didn’t oppose, just asked a couple of questions regarding of how I wanted a party to be like, spendings, etc. He said he thought marriage was overrated and too expensive and I made sure he knew I’m not keen on anything over top, the simpler the better, I just want a tiny get together with our closest friends to celebrate us. He didn’t seem to disagree so I thought the conversation was over and this proposal would happen soon.

(After this conversation, he knew I talked to my mom about our talking regarding getting married, that I even sent her pics of venue etc)

Couple of months later I had another quick chat just to let him know that I want a simple and cheap ring, before he started looking for expensive stuff. But it turned out with him saying he’s not ready to get married because he’s not sure I’m the one.

Aside from feeling like sh*t after what he said. I tried to be resfectful of his opinion and give himself time and space, no pressure, this is not how it works. 

Fast forward to now, my friend just got proposed after being together for 1,5 years. That simply killed me!!!!

I’m extremely happy for her. She had the cutest intimate proposal and she deserved that so much! But I can’t help but feeling jealous, because I wish it was me.

It’s getting hard to understand my BF, because lead a pretty serious relationship and he’s not ready to commit, when he is actually full on committed anyway? I’ve been crying a lot and when I told him the reason why, he said he is now feeling pressured over my sadness.

I don’t know what to do, I’m trying to give him enough time, space, being respectful, but doing that I’m also hurting myself and sort of feeling idiot and used. I was always very open with him, and I feel betrayed by noticing he was hiding his opinion / point of view from me, as if he was going to try to talk me out of it over time. We’re financially stable, no kids, no big life changes. He said he needs to see us going through problems and rough time to see how strong our relationship is, and then maybe change his mind, but the problem (or not! Haha) is that we have always had an amazing, caring, loving, healthy and smooth relationship, we’re mature enough to solve our problems without big dramas, but this one.

TL;DR: I’ve [32F] always wanted to get married and after 2,5 years BF [34M] reveals marriage is not for him and that he’s not ready. I’m sad and confused and my friend just got engaged which is making me feel jealous and upset at my BF. "
"My friend (m25) tested the waters in asking me (f21) out and I’m getting a lot of backlash because he was in the military for 4 years


So my friend John (25) is a great guy that is a good study buddy. I’m (21) happy to have a reliable study buddy and friend for university, but he tested the waters out. He asked about my long distance relationship and I mentioned how we care about each very much, but are too busy with university to make it official and close the gap. He asked if I wanted an official relationship with him. I asked him where he sees himself 5 years from now and he wants to make the military a full time career, have a wife that will support his career, and kids. I told him I never want kids as I’m childfree and don’t realistically see myself married until my 30’s. John says that I may change my mind and want kids in 5 years and I told him that’s total bull as I want my tubes tied. 

John was upset because he thought I wanted the same things in life. I told him I want to dedicate my life to finding what makes me happy. I want to pursue my career, hobbies, and dreams without worrying about needing to move for my husband or having to take care of kids. I don’t want to waste his time. John seemed to get the message across and dropped the conversation. He said it’s understandable and just wanted to see if it could work out.

Then my friend Jane was listening in the whole time and being nosy asf. She caught me after class and said how I completely destroyed his heart and crushed it into a million pieces. I told her he did 4 years in the military and is a big boy that can handle himself. Jane points to me that he is a hero to our country and he fought for me so I should give him a chance. I mention how we are incompatible as we want different things in life and Jane gets pretty nasty. She asks what kind of woman would not want kids or a real relationship with a marriage. I told her people want different things in life and it’s okay to not get threatened. She calls me immature and mentions that I should be lucky a guy like John would even look at me as he’s a great catch. I told her she can try to ask him out if she wants and she mentions that a woman should never ask the guy out? She finally seethes at me that she feels really sorry for John as I’m a selfish and heartless bitch.

I’m so confused at how vicious Jane turned on me. Jane is 24 still working on her 4 year degree so I always considered her more mature on these matters. I’m upset that she thinks I’m this horrible person when I don’t want to waste Johns time. It is pointless for us to date when we have incompatible goals and priorities in life. I graduate in one semester and plan to work on my masters while I pursue my career. My end goal is a doctorates degree and to learn all sorts of things. I want to learn new languages, travel, explore, take some culinary classes, and find what makes me happy in life. I don’t think that’s too much to ask. Did I handle this right? I feel really bad if I did hurt John’s feelings as we had 3 classes together already and Jane being quite nasty. Any thoughts or advice on how to proceed from here?

Td;lr John (25) tested the dating waters with me (f21) and I promptly point out our different priorities in life. Jane (f24) gets pissed at me and calls me a heartless bitch because John served 4 years in the military and fought for me. Any tips on how to handle this? Did I handle this correctly?

"I (21F) practically live at my boyfriend’s (21M) house with his family. What are some nice things I can do to show them I appreciate what they do for me?


My boyfriend and I have been together for four years during which time I've become extremely close with his family. I'm studying full time and working 2 jobs, and my boyfriend works really long hours full time close to his house, so we tend to stay at his place most nights of the week. We stay at my place maybe once or twice a week, but I tend not to like staying home alone at my place due to some recent close encounters with people trying to rob my house in the middle of the night while I'm home. 

&amp;#x200B;

My boyfriend's parents are so lovely, treat me like one of their own, and are absolutely more than happy having my dog and I come to stay with them (we've chatted about this many times). However, they're both currently not working due to injuries, and are home all day. By the time my boyfriend and I get home of an evening, dinner is cooked, the dogs are walked, the house is clean and our washing is done. It makes me feel terrible because I feel like I have nothing to contribute to the household! Before they were injured and also working full time, I would do all those things, to make things easier for them once they got home. My boyfriend and I usually very independent, we just don't have the money to move out right now &amp; of late, I feel like I'm freeloading.

"Wife keeping bringing up debt I accumulated before we got together - advice


 

Hi All,

Just wondering if you have any advice.

Me and my Wife have been together for 4 years (married for a couple of months) and just a bit confused on how to tackle this situation.

Before we where together I had some money troubles and ended up with 3 defaults on my Credit Score (these last 6 years and expire in around 1.5 years) I paid off all the debt myself during the course of the relationship but obviously i can't get the defaults off as I have no grounds.

We have spoken about moving house and when we got married last year I told her 2020 would be the year we would be looking and she agreed, as at the time she wanted a big wedding in a short space of time which i was resistant in doing but agreed, i said at the time if we have this wedding i want 2019 to get some savings behind us and having a bit of freedom with our cash and she agreed.

But the goal posts have been moved and she trying to force a house move now, although I can't get a mortgage due to my defaults (yet) so this has resulted in her requesting i try to get them off which I am but legally i don't have a leg to stand on but they expire within 2 years anyway.

These issues about my historic debt keep getting brought up and causing arguments it's like she's taking it personally because it affects her but at that point i was single and in a different place there is no way i could have known but i understand her frustrations.

She's emailing me in work that i'm not making enough effort in trying to get the defaults off, how i'm hindering our future and how it's upsetting her we own where we live now as she was a homeowner and it's a nice place, she is just eager to go back to the town in which she grew up in. A lot of our bills etc are in her name but as i earn a lot more than her I pay way above half of everything, she brings up the fact that bills are in her name in arguments (usually in unison with the debt issue) and i offer to have them transferred but she says it would be too much effort to do.

Any help would be appreciated i'm starting to feel backed in a corner and not sure what i'm meant to do, i am trying to get these removed but i am at fault but it's constant and getting me down. Every discussion or disagreement we are getting in always circles back to this like. I offer solutions to some issues she has but she never wants to take, the default is completely out of my hands and she just won't accept it..

&amp;#x200B;

how should i tackle this?

&amp;#x200B;

"My (26m) girlfriend (23f) has been messaging married manager (34m)


So I guess a little back story here is that I've (26m) been dating my gf for a little over a year and we've had our share of ups and downs, but for the past few months I'd say we've both been very happy. She lives a couple minutes walk from and spends most evenings at my flat and I've been considering asking her to move in with me at some point. Recently however I had noticed in the evenings she had been getting texts from her manager and a few times she was quite quick to turn her phone over or look at it sideways, which made me a bit suspicious, as she has never been like that before.

Also one evening going out for dinner we bumped into him and when I was introduced to him he just gave me a bit of a strange vibe like he wasn't that happy to be meeting me.

Anyway fast forward to last night I mustered up the courage to ask her what was going on as my gut instinct told me there was something not right about a married man messaging her every evening plus her behaviour plus actually meeting him.

She immediately got pretty defensive/angry with me and asked her what I was accusing her of and how it was purely platonic and began to cry, which obviously wasnt great.

I didn't back down and around an hour later she admitted that he would call her beautiful all the time and they both put kisses on their texts, but for her it was just that he gave her support with work where she's been having a tough time lately.

She showed me a quick look of the texts and from what I saw it was basically him calling her beautiful and being supportive (one message did say how tempting it was to hug her in the toilets which was weird) and from her side she ignored the complements and would just talk about work and even mentioned being with me a couple times in the evenings.

The thing is when she went to the bathroom (I'm ashamed of this) I checked her phone and in 5 minutes I'd picked up on a lot more comments from him for example ""how fucking hot she looked in her dress"" and ""how she gave him naughty thoughts"" and ""how when she was coming in early he was excited to have her to himself"", which now that I write it out is actually a little bit heart breaking.

In truth she didn't directly respond to any of those messages. Apart from the dress one where she said he basically wanted to see her with her boobs out, which I obviously didn't like.

I haven't told her I read the messages but I've pressed her numerous times to tell the truth and be honest about whats been said and she hasn't been at all. At the same time she is devastated and has apologised a thousand times. She doesn't believe he was trying to make a sexual advance and it was just ""banter"" because that's what he is like. I know how much she cares for me so for this to be going on in the background feels so strange for me.

I've asked to have the weekend for space and now I don't know what to do. I'm devastated that she is talking so much to him but also that she didn't have enough respect for me to say something when he was being out of line. At the same time when I speak to her im made to feel like I'm overreacting to the situation so I'm just confused. I'm also worried for her as she struggles with anxiety and has been doing so well lately so would hate to see her relapse if we were to break up over this.

Also not to forget he is married with 2 kids!  I feel awful for his wife that he is messaging these kind of inappropriate things. I could find her on FB and send her a but really don't know if it something I should do.

Tl;Dr: girlfriend has been messaging married manager but doesn't think his advances are sexual. Don't know how to handle the situation"
"I (21M) broke up with my girlfriend (21F) last week. Her parents are demanding holiday money.


I reluctantly broke up with my girlfriend of 4 years last week. We were both besides ourselves, her more so than me because I felt that we were growing apart and I just simply wasn't the same person anymore than what I was when I was 17. That being said, she was someone I spent 4 years of my life with, best friends for the majority of it so I am still finding it extremely hard. 

At the end of last summer, her family booked a holiday for us all to go on this summer. Me and my now ex were meant to pay for around half between us and they would pay the rest because they wanted us to come so bad. 

Her father has just sent me a message out of the blue saying ""Hi. We have removed you from our family holiday in the summer and as a result, your deposit has been lost plus an admin fee equals $551.67. Please send into my bank account using the following details... Thanks."" 

This is the first kind of any contact from either of her parents since we broke up and I'm really not sure what to do. I was made redundant three weeks ago and have currently been searching for jobs day in, day out for 3 weeks straight. I didn't receive very much redundancy money due to being under 22 and at the company for 2 and a half years. They knew I was made redundant and I think they've done this behind my exes back because I asked her about why the deposit was so expensive and she's not spoken to them about the holiday or anything. 

I'm really starting to struggle trying to come to terms with both situations and I'm starting to feel really down and in the dumps. I don't have a very good relationship with my mother and my father doesn't live with me anymore. I'm almost at the end of any sort of money I did have left and have now been handed a 600 dollar bill from my ex's dad. 

This is probably more a rant than asking for any advice so I really do apologise for not being specific on what it is I'm asking but I'm just really coming to the end of my tether with everything and I just don't know what to do.  

tl;dr broke up with my girlfriend of 4 years. both trying to come to terms with everything. 5 days later her father messages me asking for $600 for the deposit for the holiday we were meant to be going on in the summer. Made redundant 3 weeks ago, they knew this and have still asked for that amount of money. I haven't even got that sort of money. "
"My [17M] mom tells me that she wants me to go out more/to not be locked indoors and start making my own decisions but she never lets me hang out with friends or do what I want?


I [17M] live a pretty boring life. I did struggle a lot growing up with my family (abusive, criminal, trashy father, and we were poor) so back then we didn’t really do much. Usually, I just go to school, go train in my favorite sport afterschool for 3 or 4 hours, then go back home and go to sleep. On weekends, I just go to the gym or workout and stay home to play video games or fix my room and be lazy around the house. Yes I am responsible with all my schoolwork and I don’t do anything bad.

My mom complains because I am in the house doing nothing too much and she picks at me telling me to go out and be more social with people and be with my friends more. The problem is, whenever I want to go out, she says no. For example. Today there is supposed to be a party for my cousin’s birthday who I grew up with and she isn’t letting me go. Her excuse was “too many people are going to be drinking and that’s a bad influence for you”. Well, she drinks a lot and I don’t really drink or do drugs unless my mom lets me drink a little but I don’t abuse drugs and I’m not an alcoholic.

Then, she tells me to start being more responsible to buy my own things (I buy my own clothes, shampoo, and basic things I need already). I had $10k saved up cash from working all these last summers and I bought a car which my mom didn’t let me pick out. She chose the fucking car for me with my own money that I worked for. Well she started using my car as her own and messed it up now I have to pay $600 to fix it so I decided I’m going to fix it and sell it. I want to buy a small used sports car but she isn’t letting me because she thinks I’m going to drag race everybody I see on the streets. I just really like cars and prefer a sports cars more than a family car and that upsets her. So, am I being wrong here or is she in the wrong?

TL;DR MY mom is a hypocrite and it’s making me resent her more and more every single day"
"I (27F) am infertile because of my boyfriend's (28M) infidelity. Don't know if I should stay or go.


Me and my boyfriend have been together since high school, roughly 10 years on and off. We have an elementary school aged child together (we had the child shortly after high school). In the first year of our relationship things were great, but we hit a rough patch where he was being secretive and hiding his phone from me. Deep down I knew he was cheating but I was naive and he was my first boyfriend so I stuck with him (stupid I know). So we broke up and got back together and then had our child. Everything was great, until I got a text from some girl just 3 days after child was born, saying disgusting things like she wishes the child was dead, racist things towards me and so on. She also said she was sleeping with my boyfriend. I was so hurt and confused and angry so I confronted him and he denied it. So I tried to stay with him for the childs sake. A few months down the line we move in together and I see a picture of him and her giving him a lap dance, it was for his 21st birthday, he went to a bar without me I was still 20. I was so angry we got into a huge fight but still I stayed. Couple months later I had a sore that I went to get checked and sure enough he gave me herpes. When I told him he completely denied ever cheating and said it was me. Mind you I was a virgin and he was my first. So I snooped, got his password and went through EVERYTHING. And in his email I see a picture from the same girl who messaged me months before. They were kissing in some, others of her naked. I checked his phone records they talked hundreds of times a month. Even while I was pregnant. I couldnt believe it, I was completely destroyed. He apologized and I stayed. Fast forward a bunch of years and everything is good. Until I go to the doctor to find out why I can't get pregnant. About 3 months after giving birth I went to the hospital in severe pain, turns out he had given me gonorrhea and the doctors treated me but forgot to mention it. That gonorrhea turned into PID and scarred my tubes shut. If I want a baby I'll need surgery or IVF which I'm not willing to go through for him. I forgave his infidelity because we were both young and dumb, but when I look at him now all I feel is hatred. He took away the ability for me to give my child a sibling and not only risked my life but the childs life, as the doctor believes he gave me the gonorrhea before or during pregnancy and that caused my preterm labor. He is an amazing father and provider, not abusive in the slightest bit. We both make our own money and have our own accounts but he pays a majority of the bills. I am in no way stuck and if I were to leave it would be simple. But my child is what keeps me with him. The joy of her having us both together trumps every feeling I have of pity for myself. Breaking the childs heart would break mine beyond repair, I know what's it's like to have to parents who dont even speak to each other and I would rather fake happiness for eternity than do that to my child. I'm afraid if I stay I will grow increasingly bitter towards him and hurt my child in the process. Any advice is welcome. Thank you.

tl;dr: my boyfriend's infidelity a few years back left me infertile and with an incurable sti, he is a great father and provider. My fear is that leaving him will leave me alone forever, not only do I have this disease but I cant even start a family with some one new. Should I risk being lonely or try and work it out for our childs sake."
"How do I (30f) get friend’s wife (28-29f) to stay away from my kid’s birthday party?


Hi there! Looking for some advice!

First some background:

My husband and I moved to a big city a few years back and reconnected with an old friend E and his now wife J. I’ve known E since we were in high school and we were pretty close friends. Since we’ve been seeing more of each other I’ve gotten the chance to get to know his wife J. She’s nice enough but she’s the queen of over sharing to the point of making my husband and I uncomfortable. She goes into detail about her sexual relationship and it’s just really inappropriate and gross. I know things about her and her husband that I really wish I didn’t. She’ll even talk about her brother’s sexual preferences and his likes and dislikes which seems SO FUCKING WEIRD. 

She’ll come over to my house (because she knows I’m a SAHM) and overstay her welcome. She’ll stay until like 8-9 or even past that on weekdays when my husband has to wake up at 3am for work. She’ll raid my fridge and pantry and lay on my couch all day, rub her feet on my throw pillows and couch. She’ll be really loud and obnoxious so my baby can’t nap because she’s taken up residence on my couch for the day. It bothers me a lot but I’m too uncomfortable and frankly scared of raising objections because she will blow up and make a huge fight about it and I’ll basically lose my friend E over it (she’s done it to other people in our group of friends). 

Anyway on to the issue!

My baby is turning 1 soon and we’re planning on having a small intimate birthday party with family only. E and J have a wedding to go to that weekend that J doesn’t want to go to because she hates the bride (who is E’s best friend). She said she was going because it would mean a lot to her husband. Well, I found out through a mutual friend that J is planning on skipping the wedding and staying in town for the birthday party. I really don’t want her there because she requires too much attention and I would be having to cater to her instead of my family. I would be so anxious about her being there saying all kinds of inappropriate shit to try and get attention/laughs around my in laws and family. 

She doesn’t know that I know she’s coming and the birthday party is in two weeks. How do I make it clear that she’s not invited without it blowing up and losing my friendship with E?

TL;DR
Friend’s obnoxious and entitled wife is planning on coming to my baby’s birthday party and I don’t want her there because she is awful and rude. How do I get her to stay away without damaging my friendship with her husband?"
"Just broke up with my 2.5 years boyfriend


Just did a couple of hours ago.

I'm shaking. I'm lost. It was an amicable breakup. We both knew we were not right for each other, but we tried to make it work for so long. None of my friends are online (since it's really late here). I can't sleep due to this. I'm not even sure I'm sad. Just shocked.

We dated all through college from junior year till now. When senior year came, we realized we won't be together since our junior year internships were in different states, so we aimed for the same city as a midpoint city to aim for, with tons of opportunities to great companies in our field. We struggled, but somehow we made it here.

After moving in to a tiny apartment to save money, we realized how incompatible we were. We were so uncomfortable living in a small apartment. Our jobs made us super stressed and we lashed it on each other. We always tried to make things work between us. But deep down, we both knew it wasnt right and it wasn't long term and we need to break up. 

I'm posting here because I just need support. This was my first serious relationship, more than 1 year. I think I never felt love until I met him. And in the last few months especially, that love just really took a toll. I'm so sad. I'm crying nonstop. All I can think of is the good times we had. All I can think of is how necessary this break up is. But I'm still crying in just saddness that it didn't work out despite how hard we both tried

TLDR: I broke up. "
"(ex)GF [24/F] is mad at me because I [25/M] dumped her (&amp; got angry) because she's gay. Friends are on HER side


Katie and I had been dating for two years and decided that we were going to move in together. We were ""facebook"" official, had traveled together, met each other's families and even talked about a future together. Great, right? Wrong. As we signed a lease for an apartment (which I paid first/last, rather my parents gave me the money), things started getting weird. She kept accusing me of being gay (jokingly). She started talking weird during sex and requesting things that were out of the norm. She began to be distant but kept pulling me in, telling me she needed me, loved me. Then it came to a head: We were talking and she said how we were the ""best of friends"" and was happy to be moving in with her ""bestie."" I joked and said ""we're so much more than that"" and she said ""no."" She tells me that this has always been a ""friendship"" and we needed to remember that - 2 months before we move into an apartment together. I got confused and she pretended like the last two years were a ""friends with benefits"" package and we were moving in together to save costs. Then she just blurts out: ""oh, it's because I'm gay that you were confused."" I felt like it was a practical joke and I was just misinterpreting things. We fought for two days straight and the crux of it was this: *I* was crazy. *She* was on-point and I was now not who she thought I was: Apparently, I am a misogynistic, homophobic assclown. 

&amp;#x200B;

After we concluded fighting, she wanted to plan moving in together - the apartment has a living room, dining room, kitchen, bedroom and balcony - with the understanding that we're still going to be sleeping in the same room. I grew even more confused: She's gay but wants to sleep in the same bed? She wants to keep living together? I said ""no way"" and told her no way and that I would speak to the landlord. She got *furious* and said this wasn't fair and I was welching on our commitment and I was being unreasonable. She also ""opened up"" about her sexuality on all her social media channels and suddenly was flooded with messages and comments. She began telling friends (offline) that I had dumped her and wouldn't let her live in the apartment. They began to message me and say that I was ruining her coming out and that this was a huge travesty and she is living true to herself and I was making everything ""about me."" Her gay friends have reached out and said how shitty the situation is and NOT to move in with her. I receive 2-3 messages a day still and I am at my breaking point. 

&amp;#x200B;

I've had 72 hours to process all this. My relationship has fallen apart. My friends are mad at me, I have no idea what to say to anyone and I don't even know how to tell my parents. I have nowhere to turn.  I really need advice on navigating this and to sort this crap out. I feel bad about myself but I also feel like I've been jerked around. Help! 

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR Ex-girlfriend came out and thinks we should still move in. When I told her no, she got mad and her friends think I am being a bad friend during this difficult time for her. The only support I got was from her two gay friends who told me not to budge. I have no idea how to navigate this with a recently out ex-girlfriend who thinks our whole relationship was made-up in my mind. "
"My (F/30) sister in law (F/42) blames the hospital I work at for the death of her father (M/72.) It is causi g problems with family gatherings and on social media.


I have always gotten along well with my sister in law (huband’s brothers’s wife) at family gatherings but we have never been super close. Knowing I was a RN she would often talk to be about her struggles in helping her non-compliant, doctor hating father with his many heath problems (copd, smoking, high blood pressure, heart failure, multiple heart attacks, type 2 diabetes, etc.). I would occasionally recommend services but generally just listened to her vent.

This October her father apparently came down with influenza but refused to go to the doctor. She went over to check on him and found him unresponsive. She called 911 and he was brought to the hospital I work at where he was addmitted to the medical ICU after being intubated in the ER.  He was diagnosed with sepsis due to pneumonia. He lived for a week longer but after multiple organ failure his family decided to with draw care and he died.

I work in thr cardiovascular ICU, but while he was in the hospital I stopped in a couple of times to see her and offer my support. Both time I stopped by I happened to know the nurses taking care of him because they sometimes work with me on the rapid response team.

Immediately after his death my sister in law called me screaming about how the hospital killed her dad and how I needed to look in his chart before they deleted the evidence. I tried to calmly explain that legally I cannot access the chart of someone I did not care for and offer my condolances. She screamed and swore at me and accused me of colluding with the hospital. I figured she was overwhelmed with grief and would come to her senses. Unfortunately it has just gotten worse.

She continues to maintain the hospital killed her dad. Her reasoning seems to only be that people do not die in this day in age from the flu and pneumonia. When I have attempted to educate her about misconceptions in her father’s care (for example that he could not eat because he had a breathing tube, and the hospital did not starve him because he had a feeding tube) she has become irate and insists I am part of the cover up. I soon realized it was pointless to argue with her and have tried calmly telling her I would not discuss it, avoiding her, and unfreinding her on social media as she began posting rants about how she had inside information about the hospital abusing patients and tagging me in them.

At this point she has stated that as long as I work for that hosptital I can no longer see her fAmily, including our nephew and niece. My husband’s brother and parents have all awknowleged that she is nuts, but have actually suggested that I quit my job to make thing easier because there are other hospitals in town I could work for. They have also said it is better if we don’t attend family functions or holidays becausw they want their grand kids there and she won’t come if I do. I have told my husband he can go without me but he refuses.

I guess there is not much I can really do so I don’t know what type of answers I am looking for. Is there anyway to attempt to 
effectively communicate with her?  Should i attempt to talk to my in laws? Should I still send cards to my niece and nephew-who are in their teens and old enough to maybe know their mom is being crazy? 

Tl;dr: My SIL blames the hospital I work at for her father’s death and has excommunicated me fron the family unless I quit."
"My (31F) boyfriend (31M) of 7 months is actively pursuing a close friendship with a girl (20F) and I'm struggling to understand it.


I've met her. She's nice, fun, cute.. but she's 11 years younger than us and it just feels inappropriate for them to be texting daily and getting to know one another. 

I trust my guy and have no reason to believe there's foul play. She has made a few comments about preferring older men. They are both flirtatious people but that in and of itself isn't a problem. Something about th dynamic just isn't sitting well with me. 

I've brought up my feelings and my guy got defensive and says it's about trust, and that I've got nothing to worry about. I'm his dream girl. (he's truly amazing and I'm beyond lucky) But I CANT get this friendship out of my head. It feels like a risk. I've seen these situations turn into emotional and physical affairs even when they start out as platonic friendships. 

How do I proceed?

"My (29F) sister (27F) received an anonymous message that my boyfriend (34M) was cheating


Throwaway account for obvious reasons. I (29F) have been with my boyfriend (34M) for about 9 months.  So far, so good.  We've had some arguments here and there, but no serious red flags.  We had a rough spot about six months in, mostly arguing about how we spent our time together, but we worked through it and everything has been great for the last couple of months. We talk every day and spend probably together 3-4 nights per week together.  I've met his parents and most of his friends.  He's also met my family.  Yesterday afternoon I got a text message from my sister (27F) saying she needed to talk to me right away.  She'd gotten an anonymous message on one of her social media accounts saying that the sender wanted to warn me that my boyfriend was cheating on me with prostitutes he was hooking up with through dating apps.

The account that sent the message was a blank account, fake name, no connections, looks like it was created just to send this message.  The message was pretty generic, but it included my actual name.

I don't know what to do.  I don't think my boyfriend would do something like this, but this is only my second real relationship, so I'm questioning my judgment .  We met on a dating app 9 months ago about 6 months after I got out of a 10-year relationship with a guy I'd dated since high school.  Boyfriend is away for the weekend with a couple of his college friends, and I'm freaking out.

tl;dr: Sister received anonymous message saying my boyfriend is cheating on me with prostitutes.  I don't know what to do."
"Coworker [F21] doesnt wear underwear to work.


So, the other day I noticed one of my coworkers wasn't wearing any underwear. How did I notice this, you ask? 

Well...she tends to favour VERY short skirts and dresses, which, in our workplace isn't really that big of a deal. We work in pathology and wear laboratory coats. Except the other day I saw her trying to fit some cardboard into the recycling, and in the process decided to push it down with her foot...in which I got an eyefull of her snatch. Not really something I want to be seeing. 

Ever since then it's grossed me out. Does she always go commando? Is she always going underwear free? OMG, SHES SITTING ON THE LAB CHAIRS WITH NO UNDERWEAR ON??!!

Look, I'm a woman, I understand discharge happens, but Jesus fucking Christ lady, wear underwear at work if you're gonna wear short dresses/skirts that ride up when you sit down. 

Anyway, do I ignore this? Or should I anonymously let my manager know? It's just really fucking creeping me out. 

Thanks in advance.  

TL:DR: Female co-worker who favours short skirts and dresses doesn't wear underwear, concerned about hygiene of work chairs.

"My (31F) Mother (50F) keeps telling me that she hopes my unborn daughter turns out to be a bad child.


Warning:  Long.

&amp;#x200B;

Some context:  My husband (31M) and I (31F) are expecting our first child, a daughter, in July.  I'm the oldest of 3 and this baby will be my mom's first grandchild.  She is beyond excited.  

&amp;#x200B;

The issue:  My mom keeps telling me that she hopes my daughter is ""wild"" and ""bad"".  She says this because I was, admittedly, a difficult child, however, I do not think that this is entirely my fault.  I'm finding myself becoming increasingly resentful of my mother every time she says this and I don't want it to ruin our relationship, or her relationship with her granddaughter.  Any advice or insight is appreciated.

&amp;#x200B;

Some background:  My mother had me when she was 18 years old.  She and my father were not married and I've met him a total of maybe 10 times in my life.  I rarely saw my father because he has spent the majority of my life incarcerated and he is, in fact, still in prison to this day.  After one of his many releases, around the time I was 21 years old, when he gave me a guilt trip for moving states away from my family, I have had little to no contact with him, nor do I wish to.  As far as I'm concerned my stepfather will be my daughter's grandfather and my biological father will not have any contact with her.

&amp;#x200B;

Long story somewhat short, my mother met my stepfather when I was months old, they were married and had 2 children (siblings I'm close to), and they were divorced when I was 9.  I consider my stepfather to be my dad and I his daughter.  We've had our issues over the years, but we have worked those out and we no longer hold anything against each other.  My mother, on the other hand, went a little haywire after the divorce.  Now, I don't blame her for the divorce AT ALL.  Both of my parents played a part.  Afterward my mother was unable to care for all 3 of us children, and sent myself to live with grandparents, my brother to live with our aunt and uncle and my younger sister stayed with her.  I lived in approximately 10 different households following my parents divorce.  I went to 8 different schools.

&amp;#x200B;

I had no consistency, righteous discipline, or structure in my life from the time I was 9 years old.  I acted out a lot.  My mother, when I did see her, had started doing drugs (meth), she was unstable, emotional, and even violent.  We got in many actual physical fights.  When I was 15 I went out of state for a week with friends and not a single family member ever knew I was gone.  My mother ultimately ended up in prison herself for a short time, and my stepfather, after ending up back in his home for the nth time, tried to send me to a foster home, because of how unruly I was/had become.  

&amp;#x200B;

This was a turning point in my life, as I was emancipated at 15 years old.  From that point on my relationship with both of my parents greatly improved, as did my life as a whole.  I moved to a different state, went to college, started a great career, and eventually met my now husband.  Both of my parents are remarried and have settled down.  I enjoy all of their company and we visit several times a year.  Everyone is very excited about the arrival of a grandchild.  Especially my mom, who has been asking for grandchildren for many years now.  However, every time I mention the baby moving a lot, she brings up how she hopes that she is ""wild"" and ""bad"" and how ""the way you acted as a child comes back to you ten-fold as a parent"".  I've kind of brushed it off up to this point, but it's making me pretty angry and bringing up a lot of bad memories.  It's making me realize that unlike my dad, who has really gone out of his way to make amends for his part in my shit childhood, she's never acknowledged how bad of a parent she was, and that I have done all the work for us to have a good relationship.  The thing is, she's very emotional and sensitive, and it stresses me out so much to think of hurting her.  

&amp;#x200B;

The thing I think I most resentful of is her telling my child, once she's old enough to understand, how ""bad"" of a kid I was and my daughter thinking that's some sort of permission for her to do the same.  I know I'm overthinking this, but it is bothering me and I would like some advice.  Should I tell her to not mention that to my daughter?  Should I tell her how I really feel or just brush it off?

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR  Neglectful mother excited for first grandchild hopes for bad grandchild out of spite."
"My GF[20] got a tattoo of something that represents me[24M]. I don't like the idea.


&amp;#x200B;

English is not my mother tongue, so please excuse any errors on my part

So yeah, my girlfriend has had this idea of getting a tattoo for a long time. At first her ideas were things like a Lotus Flower or a mandala. I thought they were cute, and encouraged her to get a tattoo. So yesterday she told me she is gonna meet with one friend of hers, this friends also happens to be a tattoo artist so i asked her if she still has the idea of getting a tattoo, and she says maybe, then she tells me that she has a surprise for me, proceeds to show me a drawing of a fruit. Now this fruit has a special meaning for both of us, because it was present the first time we met, and it has been something that somehow ""represents"" our relationship. I didn't like the idea at all, basically because we only have been dating for ONE year, and i would NEVER do something like that, and, although i didn't want to hurt her, my face was an open book. She got a little upset, said that she wasn't getting my name tattooed or something like that, because these tattoo just doesn't represents me but the things she has learn being with me, such as loving someone more than your self and making sacrifices for your partner, etc, and even if things don't work out between us she will still like it (i'm not sure about that).

She didn't expect my reaction at all, and felt a little sad and disappointed. I told her that if she really feels that way, she should get the tattoo, but it had to be something for herself, and i didn't want to feel responsible if she somehow ends hating the tattoo. The drawing was cool (it really was).

Yesterday she got the tattoo, it is big, it covers all her thigh. I don't want to feel responsible because she got the tattoo despite my reaction and our conversation, but somehow i feel this pressure, and i wish she would never have got the tattoo.

Am i being and asshole here? Also i feel like and hypocrite because i should have told her my honest thoughts, but i just couldn't because seeing her sad makes me feel so guilty.

tl;dr: Girlfriend got that a tattoo that includes me.  Am i supposed to be ok with it? "
"My (29f) boyfriend (34m) isnt willing to comprimise for my career..


Hello, 

I need some advice please.. my partner and I were long distance when we started our relationship, we moved to a new city for a year before I agreed to move to his home town, as he was unhappy in the city that we were living in.

We have been here for 5 years now, I have completed my degree and been offered my dream job in a smaller town which is 35 miles away. 

I had discussed this with my long term partner prior to applying and he said to go for it, though he wasn't entirely happy. We plan to move when I graduate regardless, as we live in a tiny house currrntly. I feel that I have compromised by not demanding that we move to the town where I will work, but that we move 1/3 of the way from here to make things a little easier. He would then have a commute of 20 minutes and mine would be 35 minutes. 

Now that I have been offered the job he has changed his mind and been really quite nasty, saying that I am selfish and I should do a full 60 minute commute as ""I chose this"". I have tried to apply for jobs in his home town, but nothing that would benefit my career has become available. This is a once in a lifetime opportunity for me. 

My other concern is our dog, who I wouldn't be willing to leave for that many hours a day. He is not willing to skip the gym to come home early to walk her. He does not have any other responsibilities or commitments.

I have offered long distance, but he isn't willing to do that either.

What the F do I do? I need to let the job know in the next 48 hours. 

TL;DR: boyfriend would rather that I do a 60 minute commute than add 10 minutes on to his journey to work, making it 20 minutes, for my dream job post graduation. Because ""I chose this"".

"Me [27 F] dropped the l-bomb on my bf [32 M] of 8 months and it wasn’t reciprocated?


This was about 2 weeks ago. I had been thinking about saying it for a while, so I did while we were cuddling one night, even though I was nervous about it. He kissed me but didn’t say anything, so I said that’s fine! Don’t feel like you have to say it right now. And that was that. 
I’ve been feeling kind of sad and stressed since then. 
We have a very good relationship, and he treats me in a loving and respectful way. But I just don’t know if I should ask him if he thinks that he will feel that way at some point, because I don’t want to waste my time. But on the other hand, I don’t want him to feel pressured to say something he doesn’t mean. 

I guess what I’d like feedback on is his long it’s reasonable for me to wait for him to reciprocate organically.

It’s also maybe worth mentioning that he probably has attachment issues. He’s a very independent person, and has experienced a tremendous amount of personal trauma, and has lost several people who were close to him. 

TL:DR How long is too long to wait for a partner to express that they love you?

"
"I (30F) wasn’t invited to a yearly trip my friends and I have done for the past 8 years. Not sure if I’m overreacting or misinterpreting.


Made a throwaway because I’m super embarrassed by how upset I am by this.

So every year my college group of friends have taken a weekend trip to stay at a cabin, get a little drunk, play board games and hang out. I started this tradition in college with my favorite people and have been going every year to keep in touch with friends I truly love and admire. I just found out the trip is happening this weekend through a friends Snapchat, and it’s been made known that I wasn’t invited.

To be clear, I did move across the country almost two years ago, but have been trying my best to keep in touch. I was invited to/flew out for the meetup last year, and even flew out for another camping trip. I try to text people but also have severe social anxiety and rarely call anyone.

It did seem like we were losing a little bit of touch over the past few months, but I always assumed we were close enough and capable of picking up where we left off every time we see each other. I even asked the person who usually plans each year if he was thinking of doing a trip this year - he never responded.

I used to be very close with these people. We all went through very impressionable parts of our early twenties together and have always talked about how well keep in touch for as long as possible.

I’m completely heartbroken no one thought to invite me this year. It hurts so much to think that people who I hold with such high importance don’t feel I’m someone worth keeping in touch with. I used to feel so loved with them and now I’m hurt and alone.


But I know this is what happens in life. Friends grow apart and that’s always been clear, but I’m having a hard time rationalizing my emotions.
It’s just that people always tell you distance will prove who you’re closest friends are, but im truly caught off guard by how few close friends i ended up keeping.

Am I overreacting? I feel like it would be absurd and desperate to text someone telling them how I feel, but I also love them a lot and want them to know that I care enough to fly out to see them.  Am I too desperate to keep friends that may not actually care as much about me?

TLDR; I didn’t get invited to a trip with close friends for the first time in the last 8 years. This makes me so upset but I don’t know if I’m overreacting. Trying to decide if I should talk to one of them or forget about it and move on.

"
"I [26F] moved in with my friend [29M] two weeks ago under the pretense of renting until I found an apartment. Now, he doesn't want me to leave.


TL;DR: I'm wickedly confused about what is happening here - moved in with a guy to rent a room temporarily, we both agreed to it, things got hot and heavy and now he's denying that the plan was ever put into place and thinks I should say (or it's over).

Let's disregard the fact that I'm shitty for letting this happen in the first place. Times were hard. I left a bad, sexless relationship and a friend of mine said I could rent a room in his house until I found a place. Things got hot and heavy quicker than imagined as we were both attracted to each other, and lines have become very blurry. I was still under the impression that he was cool with me moving out, but he now wants me to stay.

Being fresh out of a relationship I feel that I need my independence, am I wrong for that? Every time I remind him that I want to get my own place, he gets really teary, says that he wanted to die before I moved in and he really wants me to be there. That his friends hate him now because he let me move in right after my breakup, and if I leave it will basically equal us not working out and his life will be ruined.

I fail to understand all of this. I'm unsure how I can convince him that we could still see each other and just live separately like normal people. To me it seems like if he really wanted to be in a relationship with me long term or in the future at all, he'd be willing to go slow. I can't fathom being in a relationship immediately after the one I was in simply because I moved in with a guy friend under the guise of it being a temporary thing. 

Why in the fuck will he not let me / doesn't want me to leave? I've paid him for the entire month in rent and I've been a really careful roommate. I've told him several times now how I'm feeling, but I've now actually found an apartment and am getting ready to sign the lease and I have no idea how to make this transition without him freaking the fuck out.

He makes me feel like I'm going crazy and like the idea was never to do exactly THIS in the first place. "
"My [26F] girlfriend [24F] hates my hobbies and I'm getting tired of it.


Together two years. This is a such a shitty situation because apart from this she is very much perfect. However I can't carry on like this, it's becoming too much of a hassle to live up to her expectations of what I should be like. I've been the exact same way throughout our relationship and she's acting like I suddenly started liking this stuff.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm a big fan of both anime and video games. Always have and always will. I grew up with both of those things as my hobbies and they've continued into my adult years. Perhaps GF assumed I'd grow out of them or something.. which I most definitely will not. Every single day she'll come home from work and if I'm watching an anime or playing a video game, she'll make some snarky remark and pretty much ignore me for the rest of the evening. I have to make sure to stop what I'm doing when I know she's coming home because if she catches me doing any of that, she changes completely and I won't have time with her. 

&amp;#x200B;

I am not on these things every second of the day. I am ALWAYS after her attention. But after she rejects me all the time and tells me to ""go back to my anime girls"" I just do. I'm so tired of it. When she first started being this way (a year ago), I would chase after her and tease her for being jealous and make sure she knows I want to be with her and spend time with her but after a year it's just gotten so god damn old. Every single time she catches me watching an anime or being on a game it's like she wants nothing to do with me until the next morning. 

&amp;#x200B;

Now if she sees I haven't watched anime or played a game all day, she will be ALL OVER ME. Acting like she didn't just ignore me for a day for no reason. I ask her why she's like this and she tells me because she doesn't like being ignored for this stuff, however she doesn't realise as soon as she's home I get off my hobbies and go to her. All I want to do is cuddle her and be with her after work but when she's so mood straight away because she's seen me on my laptop, I kind of don't want to anymore. She can act horribly and I don't want to chase after her lol. 

&amp;#x200B;

The way I see it, I either cut off my hobbies which I love, or she continues to act this way. I want neither of those options. I guess the other is to break up which would suck, and tbh she'd see that as me choosing anime over her anyway.

&amp;#x200B;

PS - For some reason, the anime pisses her off more than the games do. I AM NOT WATCHING HENTAI. I AM WATCHING CUTE ROMANCE ANIME, ADVENTURE ANIME, FUNNY ANIME. I have never seen a provocative anime and I don't want to. I couldn't watch hentai despite what she thinks, it's gross to me. I see anime as like a childhood thing and that's why I enjoy it. How can she possibly be jealous of a tv show?! And like I said before, I am NOT watching these all day. I watch them for like an hour or two when I get home from work before she finishes.

&amp;#x200B;

Anyone have ANY advice at all? I am SO fed up.

&amp;#x200B;

**TLDR - GF hates when I watch anime or play video games and feels weirdly jealous about it. I am tired of chasing after her despite not doing anything wrong. I try and go to her and drop everything I've been doing but she will reject me totally if she knows I've been doing either one of those things before she gets home.**"
"[28m] boyfriend has been lying about being STD tested and seeing other people. [23f]


So kind of a long story but I really need advice. My boyfriend and I were exclusive for about a month over the summer before we became  an official couple. During this time he also told me that the last person he slept with was in January and that he had been tested for STD/STI’s before sleeping with me. WELL I just found out (through a mutual friend) that he was actually seeing this girl (and sleeping with her) right up until one week before we became official (so while we were exclusive). Which also means that he couldn’t have gotten tested before sleeping with me. 

So. I reached out the girl (she is very nice), to see if this information is true. She confirmed all of it and also told me that she had no idea I was in the picture and that he gave her the impression that he was only seeing her. To make matters worse, my boyfriend initially told me he had only slept with her three times and met 5 times... She told me that they saw each other nearly every day and were physical very often. 

I decided to give my boyfriend the chance to come clean, and I asked him to tell me about the situation again. He lied AGAIN!! So I showed him the conversation with the other girl and he panicked and got extremely defensive but then eventually admitted that he had lied about it and also lied about the STD testing and hadn’t actually gotten tested until months later.  Furthermore, he didn’t even really take responsibility or apologize... he kept coming up with excuses. I had to work so I left and haven’t talked to him since. 

This morning, he texted me an apology and acknowledged he was in the wrong. I am so upset about all of this, he not only lied to me but he also put my health at risk. 

BUT since becoming official he has been nothing but wonderful and faithful. I love him so much and we compliment each other perfectly. We have a dog, we plan for the future, he listens and is always looking to do things for our relationship. 

However, I’m only 23 and am going to law school in August. It would be easy for me to start over. 

TL;DR: boyfriend has been lying about seeing someone else when we were exclusive, also lied about being std tested. But has been faithful since official. Great relationship otherwise. "
"If my husband [42] is the breadwinner, is it fair for me [40f] to do all the housework and be excluded from money matters?


Been together for 15 years and we both work from home. I work the same hours as he does but make much less because I'm in a less lucrative field, so he is the major wage earner.  I do all the chores because otherwise they wouldn't get done. He sometimes helps me when I ask but I get sick of nagging him and just do them myself. 

He also keeps money matters totally hidden from me which worries me because he's not the most responsible. When I earn my own money I end up spending it on housewares and practical stuff we need, but he rarely ever does this. I don't think it occurs to him.

We have been together for so long and really like each other so it's hard to have ""serious"" discussions that make a difference. I keep thinking that this arrangement is fair because he is the breadwinner, but sometimes it feels really unfair. Is this the way it should be and I need to get over it? And how can I broach the subject without seeming entitled, greedy, or whining?

Tl;dr-- We work same hours but he earns more. I do all the housework and cooking. I have no say in financial matters. Is this fair because he earns more money? "
"My [24F] boyfriend [29M] has been increasingly going out for drinks with a mutual acquaintance/friend [26F], and I'm questioning if my thoughts and feelings about this are truly valid.


To be specific, we have both known this female for several years. Honestly, I think she's a good person. She just has a very different lifestyle than mine: she's always seemed more adventurous, and has been going out to bars and seeking more casual hookups as she recently ended a long-term relationship. At least, these are details provided to me from my boyfriend.

My boyfriend and her have spent a lot of time together over the last 2-3 months. They decided to complete a particular research project together as well, so I can 100% understand them spending more time together as a result. Over time, it went from a brief mention of the project or her, to me hearing about her or something she did almost every day, which certainly can be natural if the two spend a lot of time together. My boyfriend also decided to try to work out with her everyday as their schedules permit. For this I was happy for him; she is very physically fit and likely has a wealth of advice for him to finally lose weight and improve his health, as my previous tries to help him become more active (as a beginner/intermediate to fitness myself) have been unsuccessful. So again, between the project, hanging out, and workouts, they spend a lot of their semi-free/free time together now.

What drives me to ask my question was what occurred this past Friday night. On Friday night, I came over to his place to finally watch the Antman movie with him on Netflix essentially as a date night, which he appeared excited about. Of course, prior to the movie he mentioned the female texted him to come out to a bar with her friends and drink. This has happened multiple times before: sometimes where its just the two of them drinking while I have another obligation, so I actually have yet to go drinking with the two of them together. However, my boyfriend and I both had an exhausting week, so on Friday night at that time he texted her that he was planning to stay in and watch a movie with me. I appreciated this, though I did ask him if he wanted to actually go out, to which he replied he did not. This was a relief for me at that time, as I actually was operating on 3 hours of sleep and didn't really have it in me to go out and risk getting a migraine. So, excited to spend time together, we watched the movie and I was truly so comfortable I fell hard asleep towards the end. The next thing I know, I half-wake up (I'm a heavy sleeper) and he's moving around his apartment looking for things. And lastly, went I finally wake up again (3-4am) he's suddenly talking about the amazing night he had at the bar with the female and her friends.

Now, before I go further, I want to say that I truly believe he 100% has the right to spend time with his friends alone and that we do not have to be ""attached at the hip"" to each other for every social event. 

On Saturday, I had a long talk with him about how the nature of their relationship was beginning to make me uncomfortable. His response has been largely to the affect of this is what people do with their friends. What also has come up is that unlike him, I don't spend a lot of time out drinking with friends, and I need to leave my comfort zone more (which may certainly be true) to better understand their casual drinking relationship. 

In an effort to patch things up, he invited me today on one of his and the female's trail hikes. I agreed to join and we all met up. I truly was able to spend time with this female just fine (again, I don't think she's a bad person), but eventually the hour-long hike ultimately turned into them talking about their wild Friday night adventures despite my attempts to interject every-so-often. So following the hike, I again explained to my boyfriend the awkwardness I felt in that entire situation, and ultimately right now I told him I need some time alone from him to think.

I guess from all of this, I was curious for outside opinions and communication/boundary-building advice. Questions in my mind include:

1. Am I crazy or missing something obvious here? (I really would like to know if I seem irrationally jealous or something!)
2. Is feeling hurt by the Friday night situation and today's hike irrational?
3. What steps can I take to finally communicate what is normally OK and not OK with friends without seeming like I'm out to control his social life?

If you made it this far, truly I thank you. I just need some outside input, and I am absolutely open to \*constructive\* criticism!

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR: Boyfriend spending lots of time with a mutual acquaintance/friend, including late night drinking at bars and I'm starting to wonder I'm way too jealous?"
"Me(33f) think my husband (41m) is becoming abusive


My husband never yelled at me, let alone was physically violent prior to marriage.  After the birth of our son he punched me in the arm because I needed to be driven across town to get the prescriptions needed for my diagnosis of the flu + pneumonia and the baby was colicky.  He broke a remote, threw toys, punched walls, etc for months but hadn’t touched me.  We briefly attended counseling and things were moderately better as long as I gave into his sexual demands (sex less than once a day left him angry, feeling unwanted, and “unsatisfied.”) 

At the beginning on March he threw a remote at me leaving a large bruise and threatened to strangle me if I didn’t go upstairs.  He apologized and things were fine except the ongoing verbal abuse until our toddler started crying at  10pm on Thursday night. He shoved/hit me out the bed. Charged me twice, including picking up his belt threatening to beat me half to death for supposedly waking up the baby.  He’s refused up apologize and stated his only mistake was marrying me.  I recorded most of the incident on Thursday night.

I’m afraid to go to the police because he will hurt me if I turn him in.  I don’t even know if what I have is enough evidence to secure a criminal conviction.  I’m terrified and trying to find excuses to run errands alone and be in a different room of the house, but I don’t know what will set him off next."
"Little sister [15] always lies, and this time lied about some serious and terrible stuff and honestly I’m [18m] kinda pissed. Should i be? Should I talk to/confront her about it?


Some backstory: Basically my one little sister has a lying issue. She’s done this for as long as I can remember, and we all know about it. They moved far away like 3 years ago and until then, i was never super close with any of them. It was like a normal half sibling relationship i guess. We texted every couple of weeks and talked sometimes. I visited them for a couple weeks last summer and got really close with my other little sister (13. side note, but is it weird that i’m so close with her considering the age gap? part of me thinks it is but oh well.) and she became like one of my best friends, and that upset the older one that we didn’t hang out or talk that much. 

Since that vacay, i text the older one every couple of weeks and the other one like every other day. After i talk with the older one, i often have to talk with the younger one and have to fact check with her, since she’s always saying some dumb shit that i don’t know if it’s true.

I went down there last week and almost didn’t spend time with her again, but on the last night my other sister went to sleep early so i went to her room and we started talking. We talked for like 2 hours about some pretty serious stuff (her parents cheating, abuse, other relationships, and childhood trauma) and i tried putting the thought that anything she was saying could be a lie aside, but then i caught her in a stupid small lie and called her out for it, and that made me question everything else we talked about. After i got back, i talked to my grandma about her parents cheating and sx abuse when we were younger to see if it was true, and nope. Last night i talked to my other sister about it and other stuff too and again, no. The thought that she made all that terrible stuff up and I opened up and was honest with her just pisses me off. Maybe it’s my fault for trying to trust her. 

I was gonna text her this:

&gt;hey

&gt;so i’ve gotta be honest with you. why do you always lie and over-exaggerate stuff? like all the time. i tried to have a real conversation with you the last night i was there, and i tried putting the thought that you could be making it all up aside, but then i caught you in a lie, and after thinking about it, i’m pretty sure most of what you said isn’t true. you wondered why im closer with (other sister) and don’t talk to you as much and it’s because i can’t believe anything that comes out of your mouth. i love you dude but it really hurts not to be able to believe anything you say. you need to stop

but i really don’t want to hurt her or start any drama. should i just let her lie and forget about it? I want to have a closer relationship with her because i know it hurts her that we don’t, but it’s hard when i can’t believe what comes out of her mouth. I’m honestly fine with leaving our relationship as is. 

tl;dr: sister lied about terrible stuff and i’m mad. should i be? should i talk to her about it?"
"Fed up with my (24F) husband's (24M) weird relationship with his mom (58F).


I am beginning to think this is not how I want the rest of my married life to be. And it sucks. It sucks not just because I truly love this man but also because it means admitting I made such a stupid mistake. The signs were always there and I was an idiot to ignore them. Somehow I thought he'd just wise up after marriage, after all it was him who proposed to me so he must value me... 

Anyway...

Basically he's obsessed with his mom. No other way to put it. 

He's never lived apart from her, even for college, until we moved into an apartment together after our wedding back in September. Even now, our place is only a few minutes walking from where he'd lived with her since he was a kid. So most days he's over there, or she comes here. Either way the effect is there's practically a third person in our marriage. I feel like her and I are constantly playing tug of war over him. Before we got married, he would hardly ever visit me, let alone spend the night. If I wanted to see him I had to go there and put up with her being around. He said she got ""too anxious"" sleeping at night without him so that's why he couldn't stay over at my old place... umm okay.

Every day whenever he's not physically with her he's calling or texting her. 9 times out of 10 if his phone gets a call or text, it's her. Sometimes he'll be texting his mom all day from work but can't be bothered to respond to a message I sent in the morning asking him where he put something or just messaging my husband something that's the start of a conversation. He'll ignore me and his handful of friends, but always seems to make time for her. They update each other constantly throughout the day on everything they're doing. She also always has an opinion on EVERYTHING. He runs most of his decisions by her and usually ends up going along with her thoughts. She's not aggressively demanding, but will get disappointed if he ever disagrees, which I still see as too controlling for an adult. On the occasion he hasn't responded to a text in more than an hour, she'll freak out thinking something bad happened to him. On more than one occasion he's taken a nap or gotten absorbed in doing something, only to come back to tons of panicked messages from her. She's even shown up banging on our door to check on him.

As you can imagine, all this has put constraints on our ability to have sex. Since we got married we've only had it twice. Before that, we were together for five years and in that time had it around a dozen times. I'm not highly sexual, but I would at least like the freedom to know I could have sex more without her monopoly of his time. I'd also like to be having it more than once every 2-3 months.

I take good care of my health and hygiene and he says I'm plenty attractive, so I'm assuming the problem isn't with me. I've asked if he's asexual and he said he isn't, he just doesn't have a strong desire for it. I can somewhat relate to that, so okay, but his drive is even below mine then. And I'm not fully sure he actually has a low sex drive anyway, because he's got no problem jerking off to porn every day. Somehow his mom being around doesn't stop him from finding an hour to himself in the bathroom with his phone to do that. But an hour in our bedroom quietly? He's too paranoid she'll hear, so he won't do it. But he also keeps letting her sleep over! And on nights she isn't here, he's either sleeping over with her, or just doesn't feel like having sex.

They're very attached to each other in a way no other adult I know is with their parents. They buy each other little gifts at least once or twice a month, mail each other letters the old fashioned way, have a bunch of cutesy pet names for each other, and in general act like they're much younger than they are. It's hard to explain. They're very physically clingy with each other too. I don't mean just lots of hugs and kisses, but full on cuddling on the couch, and even sometimes in bed. 

This all makes me really uncomfortable because it's almost like the things I do with him. He even makes comments about her appearance, not just ""oh you look nice"" but like she has huge fake tits and he's mentioned how great they look to me. I'm pretty sure I've seen him straight up gawking at her rack a few times but he always insisted he was just spaced out staring at nothing. The women in the porn he watches also all have plastic tits and I just feel like there's something not normal there, also some of that is mother/son roleplay stuff, I know porn is fantasy but come on...

I'm just tired of feeling like I'm in some kind of unstated competition with his mom. She treats me fine, she's not nasty or anything and is a fine person. But it's like she's got no awareness of how much she's in our lives. Nor does my husband. I feel like we have no privacy sometimes. She came on our honeymoon, my husband immediately invited her along with us on a weekend trip last month that was MY idea and that I apparently should have specified was just for us (why wouldn't he assume that??), she plans to move in permanently once I get pregnant to ""help with the baby"", and I simply cannot bear the thought of the years and years of this that await me ahead.

Upon expressing this to my husband, he seems to have no issue with the dynamic as it is. He's comfortable with the amount she's involved in his life. I'm not. I feel suffocated in my own home every time she pops over to hang around for however long she pleases. I feel jealous and annoyed whenever my husband pops over to stay with her for however long HE pleases. 

Have any of you ever had a partner who had a relationship like this with a parent? Is it negotiable and does it ever change? If so what are some concrete steps that could scale back the amount my husband's life is entanged with hers?

TL;DR: My husband and his mother are very codependent and she's highly involved in our lives. It goes so far as almost feeling like a three person marriage. "
"I (26/f) told my partner (28/m) a white lie on our first date and I’m going to be exposed in six weeks.


I met my partner on tinder, on our first date I didn’t feel much chemistry so when he asked if I was from Country A as my accent sounded like such to his English ears, I said yes. I am actually from country B.


I said I was born in country A, where my parents are from, but moved to country B when I was 8. I did not expect to see this man ever again.


Five years later, he still believes I am from country A and it’s weirdly become part of my identity. Both countries are relatively similar so it’s been easy to fake. In the beginning of our relationship, it wasn’t often discussed and I was still in a weird young needy phase so kept it up as I thought it was something he liked about me. I realise this was dumb but it then felt like it was too late to be like “I’m actually B-ish!” He’s never met my family and I don’t think he suspects anything.


My sisters wedding is in six weeks and we are both attending. Obviously the time has come to admit this lie but I’ve no idea how to do so. Do I go serious? Do I try and make him find it funny? I am a complete idiot but our relationship is very healthy other than my whole nationality being a fraud.


TLDR told a bad date I was a different nationality, we’ve been in a relationship for 5 years and he’s about to meet my entire family."
"A recent diagnosis has left me [27/f] pretty much disabled while my bf [27/m] continues to go on fun adventures without me and not offer much emotional support. How do I discuss without sounding like a burden?


We've been together 1.5 years. We used to hike and camp all the time. Now I'm suffering through spinal/hip issues (long story, multiple diagnoses, but severe.... causes numbness, has left me bedridden at times and in excruciating pain). I went from running marathons to struggling to make it up the stairs. He moved out of his apartment recently to drive around and camp on his own, ski, hike etc. (all the things we used to do). He sends me pics. I'm happy he's happy, but I feel like I'm now an afterthought. My depression is worsening and I suppose I want HIM to be more supportive. I asked him if he'd come to the gym with me to do my stretches and he said nah, he doesn't like the gym. He had friends visit and rented a place far away. He spent 12 nights with them and I was looking forward to having him come see me, but then he said the weather is looking great Monday-Tuesday so he'll see me after that instead. I don't want to be needy, esp. as an independent professional woman, but of all the times in my life I need support, esp. mentally from people close to me. But I don't want to bring him down as he is happier than he has ever been.

How should I go about discussing if at all? I just don't feel a lot of intimacy, am becoming a bit restless/resentful. I'm seeing doctors, PT's, a chiro, therapist etc. I've done everything I can to live independently. Had to trade in my stick shift for an automatic. New bed. New shoes. New desk ergonomically fitted. Foam roller etc. etc. I stay downstairs and don't go upstairs unless I must. I carry one grocery bag at a time inside. It's hard but I try to get by.

**tl;dr bf and I used to adventure all the time but now with my health issues he goes on his own for many days at a time, sends me pics, and we rarely talk. He is having a blast but I am slowly dying on the inside and want more support; how do I bring it up?**"
"I [26 F] hate my boyfriend’s [28 M] female roommate [22 F]


**Tl:dr My boyfriend has recently moved in with a girl and I cannot stand her. She has no boundaries with him, she’s overfriendly and she tries to join in our phone conversations.**

My boyfriend lives in a 3 bedroom apartment with his good guy friend and there’s a third bedroom for a roommate. About 8 months ago my boyfriend’s really nice female roommate, let’s call her Alana, who had the 3rd bedroom, had to move out. She was great, I really liked her so this sucks.

They found a new roommate, Natalie. From the beginning, I had a funny feeling about Natalie. My boyfriend talked about her a lot and showed me a pic of her (she’s pretty). I almost immediately got the vibe that he was much more interested in her as a person as he was Alana and possibly was attracted to her. She's very much 'his type'. Anyway, I ignored my feelings.

Then it was Natalie’s birthday and she was upset because the guy she was seeing flaked on their plans, so she was alone on her birthday. My boyfriend went out and bought her a cake and a card. This made me really upset, because on the first birthday he and I were together he didn’t get me anything, let alone a cake and a card - and he had known Natalie for about 5 minutes, and she isn’t his girlfriend!

Other than that, she’s always hanging around my boyfriend, both inside and outside the apartment and I just get the sense that she has no boundaries and she’s over friendly with him. When he calls me, she often tries to take his attention away by speaking to him when he’s on the phone so she’s almost a third person in our conversation. It’s incredibly irritating and it’s happened so many times that he has to go outside his apartment to call me because otherwise she joins in! 

My boyfriend has loads of friends, both female and male and I think most of them are great. I don’t have a problem with him having female friends at all - his are lovely. I just get bad vibes from this girl and I don’t know why. I feel really strongly that I don’t want him hanging out with her, and I don’t really want him living there anymore but I don’t want to cause problems in our relationship."
"I [25f] called out a close friend [25m] on his motivations for cheating and now we aren't talking.


So I have been very close friends with my friend Alex \[25m\] for several years now.

He's cheated on pretty much every one of his girlfriends and is currently with a girl that he cheated on his ex with. He hasn't cheated recently, although he REGULARLY tells me how hot other girls are/how tempting they are etc.

I knew about it all. I wouldn't say I approved but I just kind of... accepted it as part of his character. He was a very caring, loving friend to me otherwise and I valued his time.

I have just gotten out of an abusive relationship where I was cheated on. I went to therapy and I think I'm wising up

So I challenged Alex on his cheating. We rarely talk serious or fight and honestly, I probably shouldn't have done it because ultimately its none of my business as I'm not his girlfriend. 

He told me that the reason he's cheated is because

a) he finds the girl way hotter/sexier/has a crush on them

b) he's dissatisfied with his current relationship

&amp;#x200B;

Um??

&amp;#x200B;

The thing is, I obviously don't understand it. He's essentially saying 'I cheated because my girlfriend wasn't good/hot enough' and I just feel like that is shitty and lacks any insight or introspection.

So I called him out, and tried to get him to well, see his OWN behaviour in the whole thing.

That went down like a lead balloon. It went something like this,

""I told you that it was because I found X way hotter, and I wasn't happy with Y. I answered your question.""

""But then you could have ended the relationship. I just don't think you're actually thinking about WHY you thought it was okay to do what you did.""

""I told you why. You're just not wanting to accept the answer because it makes you unhappy.""

""I just can't understand how you can't see your own intentions in the cheating.""

""You're making me feel like shit and I already feel shit about it. That's not fair. Let's stop talking.""

&amp;#x200B;

I apologised, but he's not talking to me currently. Was I in the wrong to call him out on this?

I guess maybe it just hurt to hear that 'reasoning' having just been cheated on myself, so maybe that's why I wasn't backing down. It just seems to me that he lacks any kind of self reflection that it was a shitty thing to do. Looking back, I wanted him to see that but perhaps I went about it wrong. I've apologised though so there's not much else I can do. Is he right in this situation?

&amp;#x200B;

\*\*tldr\*\* My close friend has a history of cheating. I called him out on it after years and I think I came across as not wanting to listen and trying to make him 'see' what he did was wrong. Am I a terrible friend?"
"My sister (34) suggested my SO (31) and I (27) have a child so that she can adopt it


For context: my partner and I have been together for 4 years and do not want to have kids. I'm actually disgusted by the idea of me being pregnant, giving birth, breastfeeding and all of that for reasons I don't want to discuss. But I never talked about it to family so they don't know. I don't talk about myself much in general. My sister is 34, single, and has been baby crazy for several years, saying things like, oh I would even get impregnated by a stranger and be a single mother just so I can have a baby.

So we're at my brother's birthday party and after a few glasses of wine she approaches me and jokingly (? it wasn't funny in any way) asks, why don't you and [my boyfriend's name] have a child together? I just say, how about no. ""I could babysit for it"" she says. ""I could adopt it and raise it. How about that?"" I try to steer the topic away from the idea of me getting pregnant. I say something about children who don't have parents and wait for someone like her to come up, and why doesn't she adopt one. She says they give priority to couples and she's single, I tell her oh well, tough luck, and end the converstation.

It was rather disgusting to me, this whole conversation. I generally wish people didn't ask me when I'm going to have a child and things like that unless I bring the topic myself. But I'm generally not offended by these things because I know these people probably mean well and just don't know any better.

Now, my sister doesn't know how I feel about this whole pregnancy thing either because I never talked about it. But I would like to tell her tomorrow - when she's sober - that I wish she didn't suggest anything like that in the future. That I don't wish to discuss my plans as to what to do with my uterus, and I wish she didn't bring that up unless I do. I don't want to go into details of why these conversations bother me, though. Could anyone give me tips on how to say it so that it sounds assertive and she doesn't push me to explain myself. I'm afraid she'll just get defensive, say it was ""just a joke, why are you so serious about it, it's normal to talk about pregnancy"" etc.

tl;dr My baby-crazy sister suggested that my boyfriend and I have a kid so that she can adopt it. I don't want to have kids and am bothered by this. I want to make it clear to her that I don't want any such conversations again. Please send tips (and words of encouragement cos I'm bad at asserting myself)."
"I(31f) can't go into my favorite coffee shop because I made friends with an unstable barista(28f)


I moved to a small city in the south a year and a half ago for love. I am originally from a big city in the North East and at first the change was a major culture shock and I found it really hard to make friends. 

Most people my age where I live now are married with kids and are not passionate about the same things I am passionate about.  I also work from home so it is doubly hard to meet people and I am not a big drinker so I don't really like going to bars to meet others. 

The only place I really enjoy going to is my boyfriends favorite coffee shop that he introduced me too.  We used to go there together everyday and became chummy with a few of the barista's. I am super into film and I found out one of the girls that worked there, had a boyfriend who reviewed films as a hobby and they liked hosting movies nights. Desperate to make friends and feeling hopeful , I decided to invite them to our house to watch a movie. 

The night ended up being a success and we made another couples date a week later. This time I had less fun mingling. I noticed my new friend talked terribly about all her coworkers and there was something generally off about her. I am super introverted and private and I felt like, if she was saying such awful things about people who were supposedly her friends, what did she say about my partner and I behind our backs ?  

After our second movie night, her and her boyfriend asked us to hang out again and I told them I didn't know when we would next be available. The next day my boyfriend and I go into the coffee shop and she is working. She asks us again when will we hang out and we say we are busy for the next few weeks. After that everyday she asks the same question when will we hang out. I finally feel so bullied  that I make plans for another movie night. 

When the day comes I am a nervous wreck and I end up cancelling. After that my boyfriend and I stop going into the coffee shop for a month because we just don't want to deal with being hassled. We finally break down and go in and of course she is working and begs us to hang out soon. I tell her we have been very busy ( which is true, we both had been working our butts off, so we could save money and move back up north).  She  acts very skeptical and starts asking us specifics on our work schedules. I hate conflict and the whole conversation felt like an interrogation. 

 Now I don't know what to do. I know losing a coffee shop doesn't seem like much but it is really the only place in the city  we have, that we enjoy. We are stuck in the town, we are in for another 6 months. 

&amp;#x200B;

I feel her behavior is not normal but maybe I am being too hard on her. Anyways if any of you have advice,  I would really appreciate it. 

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR: Hung out with a girl twice who works at my favorite coffee shop and now everytime I go in she bothers me to hang out. Now I feel it is too awkward to get coffee because I don't want to hang out with her but I feel like if I am honest with her, it will make it even more awkward. "
"My (30m) wife (26f) had a serious injury and the sexual dynamic has completely changed. Don't know what to do anymore.


Hi all,

About a year ago, my wife tore her ACL. If you're not familiar with the injury, it renders you immobile for about 4 months, takes about 9 to heal completely, requires some physical therapy, and then goes back to ""normal"" as much as that's possible. She injured her knee in January of 2018, so we are about 14 months out. She is fully healed. Throughout her injury rehab, I had to do everything, as she was immobile. In other words, I worked full-time, cooked, cleaned, waited on her, and had to be at her side for most of the healing process because it was not possible for her to help herself. I'm talking basic things like ""can you help me to the bathroom?"" or ""can you grab me a cookie?"" This was difficult, but of course I was happy to do this because I love my wife. 

Now here's the problem.

During her healing process, the dynamic has changed for me from an equal partner relationship to a parent - child relationship. As such, I don't feel sexual desire for her because it just feels strange. Obviously, it goes without saying that I want this to change, but I don't even know where to begin. Does anyone else have any experience in overcoming this issue? I am really at a loss, and therapy is not an option because of the price.

tl;dr - Wife injured her knee and her recovery has changed the dynamic to a parent - child relationship where I feel no sexual attraction."
