"[Update] Me(31F) with my partner (37M), very different responses to issues that come up


Link to original thread: https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/8kxkm9/me_31f_with_partner_37m_of_2y_very_different/

  I had one response, but it really got my attention and helped me figure out that what I needed most is a quick method of communication when my partner doesn't have a lot of energy to let me know where he's at. 

  With that, I don't panic and spiral into trying to 'fix' things that have nothing to do with me, and he doesn't feel pressured by me and can approach me to talk about whatever he would like to talk about when he is actually ready. 

  I came up with a system and it has really helped us. 
""I'm at a level 1 right now"" reassures me that my partner isn't avoiding or punishing me with silence for some unknown thing I did wrong, he just needs some down time. ""I think I'm around a level 5!"" helps us figure out where we are at for social energy quickly and make sure we're on the same page before making plans.  

  Thinking about energy levels this way has made a huge difference in our relationship and I thought my little system might help someone else, so here it is:

  Level 1 - Alone time for me, myself and I. 
I love you. Please leave me alone until I let you know otherwise.


  Level 2 - Alone with you - We do our own thing but in the same space. I am reading, watching something, etc - would prefer little interruption but welcome your presence.


  Level 3 - Just Us - I want to do something low-key with just you. Watch a show, read to each other, cook a meal, go for a walk.


   Level 4 - Small Gathering - I want to spend some quality time with a few others; dinner and board games mood.


   Level 5 - House Party - Ready to drink Sangria, tell ridiculous stories loudly and play all the games with all the guests.


   Level 6 - Let's Go Dancing - Ready to deal with the general public for a night out.




**Tl;dr: Figured out a way to manage our communication differences, feeling much more secure and relaxed, made a thing that might help other people too.**

"My (35M) wife's (40F) disabled mother (74F) is moving in with us and I'm afraid it is going to ruin our 10 year marriage. She's not your typical annoying MIL , much worse.


Warning, wall of text - but suffice to say this isn't your typical MIL move in post.

My wife and MIL have a toxic relationship. Most of it is related to my MIL allowing her ex husband to savagely beat my wife as a child and refusing to leave the realationship, even lying for her husband when my wife was finally old enough to tell someone. It only stopped when he abandoned the family for a younger woman and eventually died. 

Despite this my wife has saved her mother time and time again. MIL had a Brain tumor when we first got married and her husband at that time wanted to refuse treatment. We basically kidnapped her , took her to the best treatment center, paid thousands of dollars out of our pocket to ensure she got the best treatment and let her live with us for 6 months , my wife quitting her job to be her caretaker, getting her to rehab before moving her back home when she was well enough to be self sufficient. She was given a second chance by my wife. Her husband never visited in that 6 months.

How did she repay my wife? A few months later called her on her birthday and accused her of stealing $300. Keep in mind she had lived with us for 6 months, we took care of everything, including thousands of dollars in medical bills but her husband had become enraged over a check she had written to my wife when she offered to help with some bills ONE time. She actually threatened charges so my wife despondently hung up, I immediately wrote a check (it wasn't about the money) and a letter about how much she had hurt my wife and they only spoke rarely for the next 5 years.

One of those conversations was an intervention to ask her mother to please pay for a long term care policy as now that we had children we couldn't repeat the financial commitment we had made earlier. it was about $300 per month and we offered to pay half. Her mother is high maintenance and spends quite a bit on herself but refused to pay anything so we didn't do it.

Fast forward to 6 months ago, MIL had a serious fall and her terrible husband let her lie on the driveway for 3 hours because he didn't want to pay for an ambulance. He got his redneck kids to pick her up and take her to ER further injuring her. She was completely unable to walk for 4 months and now is barely able, has trouble dressing herself and going to the bathroom. 

Of course my wife saved her again because her husband had her in a terrible facility and she was calling my wife begging to be saved. We took her to a rehab place near us (we live 10 hours away from her home) her insurance paid for 90 days but the last 3 months we've been paying thousands out of pocket while hoping she can qualify for PACE. She doesn't qualify because she's still married and her husband has plenty of assets. He refuses to visit or help out with bills. Her only option is to divorce him and sue him to sell the assets to get herself some sort of cash or at least qualify for Medicaid. She's been kicked out of her current assisted living for refusing rehab and berating staff (she's racist) we simply can't afford to put her somewhere else so until she is divorced she's going to have to live with us.

This is a depressing reality and my wife has admitted she hates her mother, gets no joy from their realationship but feels responsible for her care. We have a two story home with our master on the bottom so we are having to make our kids share a room and sleep in a small guest room upstairs for the foreseeable future.

This would be easier to swallow if MIL was grateful or helpful in anyway. She's bossy, entitled, horrible to our children, and just a weird petty person. This isn't just my opinion, I've sat in my wife's therapy sessions and heard her say all these things about MIL.

My wife knows how terrible she is, how much I dislike her (but don't show it to MIL) but I  understand how my wife has to do this. Any tips on making it work? I honestly don't want to be at my home.  I'd rather work late, travel more and be out of that place. I love my wife and kids and would miss them terribly but MIL makes me miserable and my wife miserable abd she lashes out at me and the kids. Gonna try to suck it up and deal with it but the future isn't bright 

TL;DR: horrible MIL moving in for foreseeable future, I'd rather go get my own place, need coping tips"
"My (F32) husband (M38) is cheating on me. I’m completely lost.


My husband and I are together for 12 years. We got married when I was 26 and have two children. I dropped out of university to support my husband in moving to another country for his new job. Not long after that I got pregnant with twins and I ended up giving up on my personal dreams. Marriage hasn’t always been perfect, but we’ve done our best to work on it - at least, that is what I have always believed.


Two years ago my husband was diagnosed with stage 4 Hodgkin’s and we (he especially) were put in hell. I was his primary caretaker and took a job to help support us financially. For 1.5 year I cleaned during the night in a casino in our town and I hardly slept during that time. I never complained to him about anything, as he was already going through enough. I could not compare my suffering to his and I did not want him to think I was being a victim. 
The doctor told him he was in complete remission at the start July and we could not have been happier. My husband started working from home and asked if I could continue my cleaning job until we restored our saving account. He encouraged me to work more hours, so I did. 


Fast forward to yesterday. He went to take a shower and left his phone unlocked. I’m definitely not somebody who goes to check on these things, but something was off between us for a while. I saw he had a message from this girl. I scrolled quickly through it and it was more than I needed to confirm it; he was cheating. I saw pictures of her and him saying all sorts of things. 


Apparently he is already in contact with her since halfway through May. There are many messages of him complaining about me: that I want to do everything for him and am too generic... whatever that means. 
This woman slept in my bed when I was working at night. I saw pictures of that. 
I feel like crying all the time. I feel betrayed, angry, and completely lost. What can I do.. I have twins, I have no real job... I can’t support the three of us, Both of my parents passed away in a car accident in 2015 and I have no extended family. 


I still have to talk with him about this, but how?


tldr; husband (m38) is cheating on me (F32) and I have lost it completely"
"My (29F) Best Friend (33F) is planning her Wedding but keeps comparing it to mine and getting angry at me. I'm not even engaged, how do I proceed?


Sorry if this is a bit long, I'm using a throwaway - usual reasoning. Me and my best friend have known each other for about 13 years, we met through mutual friends and kinda hit it off. We've been inseparable ever since even though we are opposites, I'm a career woman (I work in finance) and she's more of the type to want children because she wants to be a stay at home mom - which I do NOT have a problem with (sometimes its get read that way).  I'm a planner and organised person where as shes a more go with the flow type of girl (I promise this is relevant). 

Anyway 18 months ago her boyfriend proposed to her, our boyfriends know each other but they aren't particularly close so it came as a nice surprise to us. At the moment they have no venue, no date, or any plans. Which is totally cool! But she's always said she didnt want a long engagement and that she'd want to be married within two years of getting engaged - due to her wanting kids etc. The first couple of times I mentioned the wedding she's gotten a bit shirty with me, so I kinda left it. Until a four months ago when I asked if they've seen any venues they like yet and she just snapped at me asking why everyone keeps asking her about how the wedding planning is going. 

&amp;#x200B;

So I decided to take her out for coffee and ask if everything is okay because she doesn't quite seem herself and I wanted to make sure she wasn't going through anything she felt like she couldn't share with me. She opened up to me that she's worried all her ideas for the wedding are rubbish and she knows mine would be better. I told her she was being silly and also a bit irrational since I'm not even engaged. I said it doesn't matter what my wedding or anyone elses wedding will be like as long as she likes her own then who cares? (Sidenote, she knows that me and my boyfriend were currently having in depth discussions because I wanted to get married but he wasn't ready) She said ""Well you can just plan the wedding for me"" I told her I didnt feel comfortable with that, especially with everything going on in my own relationship, but I said I'd help her and make some sort of mood board. She never got in touch about doing it.   


I thought that was that, but a few days ago we were out with some girl friends and someone asked her how the wedding planning was going. She said she's given up because mine will be way better so she's going to wait until I've had my wedding and just copy my ideas. It's starting to irritate me now, especially as me and my boyfriend have gotten through the discussions and he is more open to the idea of marriage and kids  -  even to the point he's excited! But the comments my friend has made has put this downer on the whole thing. 

&amp;#x200B;

I've tried talking to her about it but she suffers with anxiety so she ends up crying and freaking out. This isn't the first time she's made comments, she once moaned at me because if I had kids, my partner could support us and I wouldn't have to go back to work, but they cant afford for her to be a stay at home Mom. I've worked very hard to get where I am in my job, and so has my partner, this has involved working weekends, long evenings and business trips. I've never mentioned how much we earn or anything like that, she just assumes. 

&amp;#x200B;

So I'm seeing my friend on Saturday, its a group situation so someone will ask about her wedding.  How do I react if she says the same as last time?

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR; My best friend keeps making comments about my wedding being better than hers. I'm not even engaged and it's starting to make me feel guilty. How do I fix this?"
"I [26] am getting tired of supporting my boyfriend [25m] with his grad school dream


I'm writing here because I want to support my boyfriend of 3 years, but he keeps making the same mistake over and over.

My boyfriend really wants a PhD but I don't think he's capable of it. He is very smart, but he's a lot like me: good at individual tasks, working with others, and following directions, but not a self starter, and not good at working alone or planning major projects from start to finish. He doesn't have a clear goal in mind for what to do with a PhD he just says he wants one.

I actually once attempted to get a PhD in the same subject, so I know what it's like. I told my boyfriend it's not like college at all and he says he understands, but then will comment how he loved college so he's sure he will love this too.

He also clearly has no idea what the requirements are. I explained that at my old school most people who came in with just a bachelor's would take 7 years to get a PhD. A few did six years, and I know one person who is legendary for finishing in five. He said that was ridiculous and it should only take 3-4 years total. I told him he'd probably spend 3 years just taking classes, so he interrupted and said ""yeah, so 3-4 years."" I asked when he would do his comprehensive exam and dissertation and he claimed he would do them while he was finishing up the last year of his classes. I told him nobody does that, it's not possible. It turned out he thought a comprehensive exam was like a final exam you would take for a college class, a little difficult than a regular test, but if you study for the last few weeks and cram a little more a couple days before it will be fine. I told him what a comp exam actually was and he clearly had no idea what I was talking about.

He also doesn't understand that to be employable afterwards, he has to have his own research agenda with published articles. He thinks if he has trouble finishing he can sacrifice the ""extra"" work of publishing research. That's the opposite of what you are supposed to do. I've seen many people delay finishing their dissertations to get a few more publications out, so they look better on the job market. What's frustrating is that he's not hearing me, he'll agree that I'm right, but a few weeks later will go back to repeating the same stuff that I told him was wrong. He's not getting it. The problem is he has no plan b and is convinced he will get the PhD. He is putting our lives on hold over this. We had talked about moving in together but he said he doesn't want to until he gets the school sorted out. So he still lives with his parents. He also refuses to look for a better job. I think he could get one because he has real work experience now but he is so convinced he will be going to school that he doesn't want to look for something else.

This is also his second time applying. We went through all of this last year and he got rejected from every school. He was a wreck for awhile after and I think the same thing will happen again. I asked what he would do if he got rejected again and he said he would try again next year. But I don't think I can keep doing this. There are applied Masters degrees and certificates that I think would be a much better fit for him but he won't consider them.

How do I support my boyfriend even though I think he's making a mistake? 

Tldr: boyfriend is putting our lives on hold to apply for PhD programs that he likely won't succeed in."
"[Update] I [20M] confessed to my crush. She accepted a date, but i'm so stressed i don't know how to handle it


[old post](https://old.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/9heqbp/i_20m_confessed_to_my_crush_she_accepted_a_date/?st=jmhqe0am&amp;sh=9d910630)

So, i've read all the comments, and i really thank you for that. I called her to set up the date and location. She cut me off by saying that she wasn't interested, and apologized. I said it was okay, then cried all night.

I know that i shouldn't care, that nothing had really started, that i'll get other chances, and 100 others stuff i've read countless times... but i can't think that way. I'm asocial, but i still try to interact with other. I hoped that finally something could work out.

Since i began being interested in woman, i've faced 3 rejections, 1 bad date; and nothing positive. I feel like i'm doomed, i can't handle it anymore. 


  **tl;dr**: she cancelled the date and i'm feeling depressed"
"I [52F] and my husband [57M] are having issues with how to deal with my stay at home son [30M]


So 6 years ago my son was gainfully employed and seemed to be on a good track in life. Then one day at work he got injured, the ladder he was on gave out and he fell down. His leg was cut by the latter and he broke 2 fingers. 

He sued and won a good sized settlement. He moved back home with us for a while because he wanted to use that settlement for a down payment on a house and figured he could save money by not paying rent. We obliged.

That was 6 years ago. Now he’s 30, living at home and doing absolutely nothing but smoking weed, getting drunk, playing video games and gambling online.

He still has money and apparently wins often enough on gambling that he doesn’t hurt for money, infact there’s been a couple of times where he tells us he won a few thousand on a bet. That’s good and all, he also pays the Internet and electric bills. 

But he doesn’t leave the house! At all! And that is the problem. I’ll be honest, I love my son but I don’t want to live with him forever. 

He orders food everyday, twice a day. He’s gained 200 pounds, doesn’t exercise, he doesn’t do shit except play his games and smoke more weed than willie Nelson. 

My husband is okay with all of this because our son payed to repave our driveway and paint our kitchen. But what was also 5 years ago! 

My son lives in our basement (lol yes I know the old joke). He has no social life whatsoever. But that wasn’t the case for the first couple of years. He had friends and girls over regularly but that stopped. He hasn’t spoken to anyone else but me, my husband and whoever delivers his food in years. Even our daughter cut ties with him when he didn’t go to her wedding. 

I don’t want to say he has reverted because he doesn’t really ask us for anything. But still a 30 year old shouldn’t be living at home, not leaving the house for any reason. 

I don’t know what to do anymore. My husband vetos my kick him out options so I’m stuck. 

TLDR: my son stays home and doesn’t nothing at all "
"UPDATE: I [25f] plan to ask my FWB [29m] if he’s interested in a relationship. Is this a good plan and/or should I delay?


[Original post](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/9ik5u6/i_25f_plan_to_ask_my_fwb_29m_if_hes_interested_in/)  

He came over as planned. Pretty immediately started talking about how we’ve both been sad lately, which was nice. Just being there for each other. After we ate dinner, he suggested we go cuddle, which led to sex. After sex when we were cuddling he did what everyone told me not to do: brought up our relationship.

And he’s not interested in more. In the kindest way humanly possible, he told me that with his previous relationships there’s been a point where he *knew* they were for him, and that’s not happened with me. He said that he doesn’t know if it’s something wrong with him or if we’re just not romantically compatible in his eyes, but that’s how he feels. I got the dreaded “you’re great, but…” speech where he listed all the reasons he cares about and respects me, but none of the reasons he isn’t interested more.

I didn’t tell him exactly how I felt because I would’ve started crying, naked, in his arms, and while I’m working on emotional vulnerability, that would’ve been a bit too much too fast. Instead, I told him I was asking him on a date to explore some confusion about how I feel about him. I told him I‘m still confused and may need space, and he said that’s fine and was happy that I was able to tell him that, and that I can just let him know. He told me that he’s resisted bootycalling me when lonely because he doesn’t want to use me that way, and that more important than any of the sex or intimacy is our friendship, and he wants to do anything he can to preserve that. I agree. 

He hugged and kissed me a bunch before he left and I just wanted to shove him out the fucking door so I could cry. I almost wish he’d been cruel so I could be angry at him. I plan to text him today and tell him that I wasn’t totally honest because vulnerability is hard, that I did want more, and that I’ll need space to get over that, but also our friendship is the most important part and I’ll let him know when I’m ready to continue it.  

TLDR: He has no romantic interest in me, but was nice about it. I’m devastated, but all I can do is tell him I need space and hope I can heal enough so we can continue our friendship. "
"How do I (30'sF) put a stop to unwanted advances from classmate (30'sM) who I've said ""no"" to multiple times?


For context, I've gone back to school to pursue another degree through night classes. The field I'm pursuing is mostly male dominated and I'm the only girl in my class. Classes are small with 16 or less students so we work on activities and labs together in class. The classmate I am having issues with is in all my classes.

**Week 1**

Classmate asks normal questions but then suddenly asks about whether I smoke? Which I answer ""no"" but then he goes on to ask if I drink, do drugs,go clubs, mention strips clubs? I end the conversation there. 

**Week 2**

During a class lab, I stepped back to let my instructor go through and accidentally bumped into a classmate. I say sorry and he responds with something which surprises me so I ask him again. He says ""do you want to cuddle?"" and I immediately say ""No"" and keep myself as far away as possible. He goes on to say it again a couple of times and I tell him stop.

**Week 5**

He approaches me again and asks why I don't smoke, drink, go to strip clubs, mention strips clubs, asks for my number, jokes about cuddling, if I've had sex, mentions porn and what type of guys I like. I clearly tell him that I do not want this conversation and clearly tell him I have no interest in him. I also tell him any further comments will led to me ending all communication.

**Yesterday**

He enters class, and sits in the seat next to me. He asks how I am. I give him non-friendly and short reply ""good"". He then asks for my for number. I say ""no"". He asks ""why?"". I say ""my choice"". He continues asking. I look at him and say ""no means no"" and ""I mean it"". He does not speak with me for the rest of the class and anytime he comes near I make it a point to step away.

**My concern**

Some my classmates have said he still doesn't get it. They have approached him about stopping this behavior. At this point I'm not sure what other things I can do. My main goal is to graduate this semester and make through the next few months. This person creeps me out as he even mentioned there is x number days I can see him until semester ends.

**TDLR**

Classmate is making advances that are getting very creepy during class and break times. I've told him no but he stops briefly and it starts over. I have 11 more weeks of classes until graduation. Other classmates have noticed and are helping me. However, they can't always be there so what else can I do to get this person to back off?"
"I [27M] got married to my partner [24F] last week. We got lots of gifts, cards and money and my in-laws opened cards and took money from them.


My wife is Indian and I'm white. Last Friday my wife's father hosted a party for her (I believe it's called a Jaggo), relatives of my wife who couldn't make it to our actual wedding day came to this, during this party my wife's relatives had given her some cards which contained money in. 

From what my wife has told me her parents told her that they were keeping a hold of these cards so that she can collect them after the wedding was done.

The whole day was fabulous apart from some hiccups which were down to her parents, her father invited 30 more people to our ceremony to which we did not know about until it happened, we had also paid for 120 people to be fed at our reception party and he had also invited 50 more people to the party later that evening. 

We had a buffet so people could pick and choose what they wanted to eat, her father had promised her that even though she did not invite these guests that they would not eat the food that was provided and go and get their own later that evening, but as soon as the buffet opened we had noticed that they had gone to get food which had left some of our intended guests a little short.

Then the next day we had gone to her parents house to collect the gifts which were left for us (had our names on and everything) to find out the cards that were held for us were opened and money removed.

She had asked her father what had happened to the money and asked him that he give her the money back, he said no, because he had paid for our wedding and that he should get some money back, despite the cards being named for us to open.

This had left my wife screaming and shouting at her parents saying you do not do this to your daughter on the week of her wedding. She has told me she doesn't want anything ever to do with them again, she doesn't want to even let them know of their grandchild when we decide to have children.

We had also received a phonecall from the venue were we held the party and who had catered it for us saying that my wife's mother had phoned them up complaining about the quality of the food and that there wasn't enough to go around, to which my wife told the manager of the venue, the food was excellent and not to listen to her mother as she seems to be finding a way to get refunded for something.

I'm torn, what can we do in this situation? I used to love my in-laws, I thought they were great people but I do not know why they are doing this to us, the potential money that was given to use could've helped us a lot.

tl;dr: Father in law paid for wedding, invited extra guests to our ceremony and party unbeknownst to me and my wife. He had also taken money from the cards that were given to us."
"(37m) My wife (36f) has been coming home extremely late frequently recently, is she hiding something from me?


We have been married for 10 years with our 11th anniversary right around the corner, but recently something has felt off about her. She works as a restaurant manager that a few months ago opened a bar which extended her working hours to midnight. Before that she would come home at around 9pm but since the new changes she usually comes back around 12 to 1 since the restaurant closes at 11:30pm. I usually wait for her so we can still spend time and it actually works out since by the time she gets home the kids (8 and 6) are asleep and we can get a few hours of alone time. I work at a startup so my hours are more flexible but its usually 10 or 11 to 6 or 7 so we still get time to see eachother. The kids actually rarely gets to see their mom during the weekdays but weekends we make sure to spend a lot of family time.

Recently though it feels like I've been able to see her less and less as she would frequently come home way past the closing time, usually way past 3am, and she's said that it's because she needs to drop off one of her friends who works at a bar nearby plus taking care of other stuff for the restaurant so she tells me to go to bed early, which I did pretty much every day now. She would come home maybe once or twice a week at the usual 12 or 1am but all other times I would fall asleep without knowing when she came back. The other day I woke up at around 4:30am to find my wife still not home, which worried me and I ended up calling her, but she didn't pick up until 5am when she was on the way home. I told her I'm worried for her health working so late but at the same time it's weird that she has to work this late past closing time. I'm a heavy sleeper so I usually don't know when she comes home, but recently when I wake up to piss, I can tell she definitely comes back later than 3am most of the time.  but when I ask her about it all she says its because the restaurant is doing really well recently. What really got me worried was just yesterday, my bathroom break just coincided to when she came home, this was around 3am, I heard her come in the house, thinking she would come up I went back to bed, but instead she was downstairs for about 5 minutes then went outside again. I was dumbfounded to why she came back then left, I was sure it was her because I saw her car pull in and then after she left her car was gone too. The whole night I couldn't sleep and she ended up coming home at 7am when she came home she was surprised I'm still up, when I asked her about it she told me something about the restaurant supplier and what not and a bunch of stuff I've never heard of before. I didn't want to say too much because she was clearly exhausted and I had almost no sleep either and I had to drop off the kids this morning. I have to go to work soon but it's been bothering and what happened yesterday is still bothering right now, is my wife hiding something from me? She seemed really vague about her reasons for being out so late, I don't understand her industry so I don't know how a restaurant manager has to stay out until 4am or even 7am? I don't want to be suspicious of her since she's the love of my life. Any opinions?

TL;DR - Wife who is a restaurant manager has been coming home really late (3am to 4am at least) lately and yesterday she came home at 7am after coming back once for 5 minutes at 3am. What exactly is going on?"
"[UPDATE] I'm [27F] feeling undervalued and a non-priority to my boyfriend [28M] to the point where I think it might be best we break up


Original post is [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/9iwess/im_27f_feeling_undervalued_and_a_nonpriority_to/). My boyfriend \[28M\] and I \[27F\] had been dating for 8 months. We hit a rough patch where we hadn't seen each other a lot and I was starting to feel very distanced from him. Our communication was totally out the window and he wasn't putting in effort into the relationship anymore. 

We had a phone conversation later the day I made the original post because I didn't know when I'd see him next. We decided it was best to end things at this time. He came over last night to bring me my belongings that he had at his place. We had a good conversation and it reaffirmed my initial thoughts that he wasn't in a good mental state and was pushing things away to avoid confronting them.

He told me his feelings are completely dulled right now and the only things that register for him are anger, frustration, and guilt. He said he couldn't remember the last time he was excited, except for two years ago when he accepted his current job. I told him that I think he's registering the excitement he would have experienced then would be like top level excitement, such as the feeling of achieving a major goal, but not all excitement is at that level. I don't think he understands that all not emotions are so extreme and passionately felt, which I can understand because his career demands extreme feeling and physicality. 

I told him I don't want him to live with so many *what ifs* or the grass is always greener mentality because it's not a positive way to live. He agreed that he does live with a lot of probability in his head and regret. He said he has been going in and out of these funks for 4ish years and that made me think he's unaware of the fact he might have some form of depression because all other aspects of his life are fine, but not his personal wellbeing. He works out and he's social, but he's not feeding himself emotionally. He told me he thinks he'll regret not actually trying to work on things together and I said I was upset that he hadn't, but I understood.

I thought about it more after he left and I think he checked out of himself emotionally about a month ago. An action of a friend hurt him and he just kind of shut down after that. I get this feeling that he doesn't know where he belongs in the grand scale of things, and that's totally normal, but he just needs to figure it out for himself.

One thing that confused me a bit was that he got kind of upset when I told him that I'll miss him but to make things easier for me I can't follow him on social media anymore. I'm not sure why this bugged him but I explained that to move on I need to not be reminded of him whenever I'm on social medias. Overall the conversation itself was good. It was nice to see him one last time and I'm glad we had the talk because there's no ill will or anger in this, just hurt feelings and sadness. 

**TL;DR: My boyfriend \[28M\] and I \[27F\] broke up. I think his mental health is in the dumps and he doesn't really realize it. I wish we could have worked through this but it didn't end up that way. I'll miss him.**"
"My (m55) 20 year old daughter is dating a 57 year old man.


I'm at my wit's end. I don't know what to do. My daughter is a junior in college and is incredibly intelligent, kind, and well-rounded. She is also very beautiful and popular and in a sorority (I hate to reference these qualities, but I want it to be known that she isn't having social issues). I just discovered that she has been dating a 57-year-old man that is a professor at her college since the summer. He isn't her professor. She says they met on an online dating website, and she approached him first. She really likes him and says that they have a lot in common. 

I'm her father. She had a totally normal upbringing. She obviously trusted me enough to tell me this. I can't imagine any universe where a relationship like this is equal. I don't know what to say to her, because frankly I am disgusted and think this is inherently wrong and she is being taken advantage of. What do I do?

Tldr my daughter is in a relationship with someone older than me. "
"My [24F] Husband [23M] won't lock the door and I feel like I'm about to snap.


We just relocated from another area 1 month ago because he transferred jobs, but it's essentially the same job just new digs and some new stuff to learn. For the past 10 months I have essentially driven us everywhere all the time to compensate for him working and me being at home which was fine. For the first two weeks here I drove him to work in the morning but for the last two weeks he has taken the car because he gets done early. I get he is stressed out and trying to take everything in/do things correctly, but I think this is ridiculous.

I am so sure in the last 2 weeks that he won't lock the door, that when he leaves I get up to check and sure enough, half the time at least, it's unlocked. I don't need to get up early so it totally disrupts my sleep and physically stresses me out. We don't live in THE nicest area nor are we super familiar with it, so it causes me intense anxiety to think I could fall back asleep naked and someone could come in the door to steal our stuff or harm me. I locked my door all the time in past apartments and 3 times it wasn't locked drunk college strangers have entered the apartment so I am acutely aware that while this it is unlikely it DOES happen. It only takes one forgetful moment.

This bleeds over to when he comes home.  In the first 2 weeks when I didn't pick him up he got rides. Upon arriving home he has left his personal key in the door 3 times, and MY car keys with another key to the house in the door once in the two weeks since he has started taking the car.

This morning, he got a ride to work because they had to do something early, but he took my car keys anyways and his own personal key which he forgot he had, and STILL DIDN'T LOCK THE DOOR. Now I can't leave until he comes home in a few hours because I have no key.

We have fought about this over and over, he's not the devil, he's the light of my damn world, but he excessively forgets small things like the toilet seat and locking the door. I have threatened to take his keys and he got really mad at me for treating him like a child, but even children lock their doors.

An important revelation I had the other day is that in both of his childhood homes, they NEVER locked their doors. He is completely not used to thinking about it. But isn't this is overkill and downright neglectful? If he hadn't owned a car in the past I would check more often that my car is locked, which I do. I've been sweet, mad, gentle, and even left sticky notes for things like the toilet seat. I feel unsafe, unheard, and every time I grill him on these things he says I don't acknowledge the times he DOES remember and all I do is criticize. I don't want to sticky note my door and just want to feel safe. How can this be helped?

TLDR: Husband won't lock the door and forgets his keys in it, I feel unsafe and neglected."
"My cousins [20sF] just got disowned by their parents for dating interracially. How do I [21F] support them and be there for them?


Both of my female cousins got disowned by their parents because they are dating non Desi guys (Cousin A is dating an African American guy and Cousin B is dating a male Chinese student and Cousin C is dating a White guy). We’re all Indian Americans.

This caused a stir in our family. All 3 got disowned and their  parents warned other family members to not talk to them. My parents tried to talk to their parents but didn’t succeed. Their parents also see me as a bad influence since I have a non Indian boyfriend. My parents are ok with my boyfriend and they are ok with my little brother, who expressed his interest in a White woman and an Asian woman. 

Even more sad part is that their brothers (Male cousin A and Male cousin B) are dating a White and a Japanese American woman respectively. Both plan on marrying their girlfriend’s and their parents have no problem. I’m sick of the double standard, and so are my cousins and my parents.

TL;DR: What can my family do to support my cousins? "
"my girlfriend is really embarrassed about something pretty minor (23m/f)


My girlfriend and I have been dating for a few months. She was in an abusive relationship when she was 16-19 and goes to therapy. Sometimes, it affects our relationship but we've been okay so far.

My girlfriend spent the night and got her period. She only stained the sheets a little, no big deal. Apparently the same thing happened when she was in her old relationship and her ex rubbed her face on the dirty sheets. 

All day, she's been flinching every time I move too quickly or come to close to her. I feel really bad. What can I do to help her feel better?

TL;DR My girlfriend bled on sheets and is freaking out because of a bad past relationship. How can I help her?"
"My [35M] parents live back in America while my wife and I live in Italy. They're dragging me threw the mud to the rest of the family because we don't want to travel with our son [6 weeks] and daughter [3F].


Apologies is this is messy. I'm on my phone and it's late at night. 

My wife and I have been together for 8 years and married for 5. We have two children. Our daughter is 3 and our son is just over a month old. When we got married, we decided to move back to where she was from. She was pretty home sick. She didn't like America as much as she thought she would. She missed her family. I was hesitant at first, but decided to do whatever made her happy. And I've liked it here. 

Normally we would go back once a year to visit. When we had children, that changed. We couldn't travel as much as we use to. When they're this young, it's not that good of an idea to travel. It's just a big task to begin with,  We could probably go to America with our daughter, but our son is out the question. He's just over a month old. We've been offering for them to fly here and we'll pay for it. We just don't want to travel with children because it's distressing for them when they're this young. 

My parents have been dragging me through the mud to everyone else in my family. They're claiming that I've abandoned the family for my wife's side of the family. They're saying that I'm unpatriotic to America. They're making up other blantant lies like my wife is trying to keep the children away from them. It's not her fault my parents lack the basic skills to understand time zones and is not going to wake the kid's up in the middle of the night.  

**TL;DR: Wife and I offered to pay for my parents to come to Italy. They're acting like brats and I need advice.**

"I (25F) work at a martial arts gym as a personal trainer/instructor. My dad (69M) came to my work and caused a scene and tried to take me back to his place.


There are several layers as to what lead to my dad doing what he did yesterday. The biggest would be him not liking my career choice. I have always been a very active person. I have been doing martial arts every since I can remember. I also decided to get an in health and fitness once I graduated high school. I got a job working at a martial arts gym and I've been really happy with my life. 

I am one of the teaches for an MMA class. I am a teacher for a self defence class. I and train with competitive fighters. I also serve as a personal trainer for people. I have my hands in everything. 

It's not uncommon for me to get bruises. Especially when I'm helping someone to prepare for a fight. My dad has always hated this part of this. He hates that I get hurt at work when it's really no big deal. He always tries to act telly macho to me saying he'll bash someone's head in if they hurt me. Just testosterone filled nonsense. 

The second layer to this would be my boyfriend, Ryan. Ryan is the first guy I've introduced to my family that I've been with. I've mostly just had friends with benefits that my parents would never meet. My dad doesn't like, Ryan (25M). He doesn't think Ryan is manly enough because of his job. Ryan is a ecologist and park ranger. He takes people on hikes and tells them the history of the land, and looks after and monitors the environment. My dad thinks that job isn't respectable and we've gotten into many arguments about that. 

My dad has this idea in his head that he can't respect, Ryan. He told me he doesn't understand how a man can be happy about his girlfriend getting bruises. Everytime Ryan has seen a bruise on my body he always asks if I'm okay. He offers to get a cream for it. My dad wants Ryan to fight people that hurt me at work. He wants Ryan to go and fight trained fighters. Think about how stupid that sounds. 

My dad came into my work. He started to raise his voice at the receptionist asking for me. I heard him and asked what the fuck he doing. He said he doesn't like me working here because it seems barbaric. I told him to leave and he started yelling that he's going to do what Ryan should have done. He tried to challenge one of my male colleagues to a fight. Eventually he left when we threatened to call the cops. 

You have no idea how lucky I am that the owner likes me and let it go as not my fault. 

My dad thinks that he was completely in the right and I just don't know anymore. He talks crap about Ryan all the time to other members of the family. He doesn't think I can do my job and need his protection. I need some help because I just don't know. 

**TL;DR:** Dad doesn't like where I work. He came in causing a scene yelling that he's doing what my boyfriend should have done and take me home. "
"I (35F) told my fiancé (50M) that I wasn’t sure he is a good person. Now he’s moping and stomping around the house for the past 24 hours because “this is how terrible people act.”


*long!

So I kinda just blurted it out last night. “I’m just not sure that you’re a good person.” It really is a terrible thing to say, and I don’t blame him for being mad and hurt.

Backstory: I’ve been with Jim for 5 years next month. We met at the bar I used to work at. He was a musician whose band played a few shows there, and he was also a semi-regular. I was attracted to his wit, sense of humor, his laugh. He had a great job and a great group of friends. Our social circles overlapped.

I had always known Jim as a social drinker, and early on in our relationship I learned that he used cocaine quite frequently. Prior to dating Jim I had only encountered coke a couple times. I guess my first mistake was taking all of this drinking and drugging as “normal” behavior, and pretty soon I started using with him a couple times a week.

I had bigger dreams though, and managed to buy a house about 2 years into our relationship, on a relatively meager (&lt;$30k) income. Jim had been living with me at my old apartment, and he also moved into the house with me. He has always contributed a fixed amount to expenses. Aside from our shared expenses (which I manage) I’ve never really dug into his finances. He never wanted to discuss money anyway.

Last year, I switched from working night shifts to a 9-5 day job. This is when I really began to notice the extent of Jim’s drinking and doing cocaine. It turned out that all that time I was working nights, he would use all that time after his 9-5 to drink and do cocaine, usually by himself. Then he would try to sober up and hide it by the time I got off work at 10. Once I started working my 9-5, he began to take off from work earlier in the day, and would generally take off at least one day a week.

At this point I tried initiated conversations about his drinking and drug use getting out of hand. Whenever I would try to schedule time to talk, something always came up on his end. When we finally would talk, it was always one-sided and I was always the bad guy for bringing this stuff up. He would shut down completely. And now that he was “busted,” he turned from happy, funny Jim to moody, irritable Jim.

Fast forward to this past March. He got fired from his great job. This sent him in a spiral. His bff and I attempted an intervention and sent him packing to his parents. He came home a week later . A few days after that, he ended up hospitalized for several days. 

And so commenced 6 weeks of rehab. It was tough, but I really enjoyed the time alone at home. His first 2 weeks there were hell, but he turned a corner and became the sweetest person ever.  It was almost like having old Jim back, only sober this time. 

After rehab, I knew to tread with caution, and to practice detachment and realize where I have been codependent. It’s hard, but I try and I think I’ve done an ok job of keeping myself busy with projects, hanging with my friends and family, not harping on him to get things done, while also trying to be supportive.

But man, has it been TOUGH. In the 4 months since he’s been back home, he’s applied for exactly 1 *real* job, and that was a job that I found. He expected me to write his resume- I agreed to only format it after he wrote it. He is applying for BS jobs weekly for continued unemployment. Last week I asked him when was his deadline for getting a job. He said Christmas; I said then that is my deadline too for him.

He has copd, depression, anxiety. But he refuses to go the doctor to get his scripts refilled. So he is out of meds. He is constantly up and down mentally, complaining about his breathing. He hasn’t been to an AA meeting in over a month.

Then his best friend and bandmate died suddenly a couple weeks ago. That super sad occurrence  was another huge hit to his mental health, and sorry to say it but another excuse for him to continue not doing anything with himself.

A few weeks ago, I noticed something shiny and new on his desk in the bedroom. It was a black metal car logo, like from the front of a car. “Where’d ya get that from?” I asked. “The car dealership when I got my oil changed.” “Oh, they gave it to you?” “No” “You bought it?” “No” “You stole it??!!” “No, I just took it.”

This incident led me to remember all the times he stole something innocuous from somewhere. Hotel towels, robes, etc. He even stole medication from me on more than one occasion then lied about it!

The kicker was when I learned that he’s recently been borrowing money from his parents. In between his hectic schedule of sleeping and watching tv, he’s been hitting the grocery store frequently and buying random things off the internet. 

Trying to think best thoughts, since his mom has just deposited money in his account, I asked him how his parents were doing, and there dog? He didn’t know because he hasn’t spoken to them in several weeks. “Well how did you ask for money?” I asked. “Via text” he said.

This is when I kind of lost it. I said that he should really call his parents. He said he would later. I said that we’d all heard that before. His parents have sacrificed so much for his recovery, helping to pay for his treatment and paying for his health insurance. And they accept him with open arms every time he shows up. And it turned out that he didn’t even use the money for its intended purpose (his car payment)

Then I meekly mumbled “I just don’t know if you’re a good person.”

He was livid. “So I’m a terrible person?! Do you think I’m a terrible person?”

To further complicate things, I just got a huge promotion that doubled my salary. He’d been gunning for house husband. There is no way in hell I want to support him.

Reddit, if you made it this far, thank you so much for reading. I suppose I’m looking for words of wisdom.  Is this part of his recovery, and will he get better? I know I’ve gotten myself into this mess, and I think I finally realize that I need to get out.  I just lack the energy for the shitshow that may ensue, and I admit I’m kinda scared to be alone.

TL;DR Fiancé is a recovering alcoholic/drug user. Unemployed for 6 months, home from rehab for 4 months. Not looking for a job. Still lying, stealing, and taking advantage of people. Mad that I questioned that he might not be a good person."
"Hello I'm 14 (M), and my dad (45) is getting into a relationship again and it makes me upset


We lost my mom when I was 8, and ever since then it was just me &amp; my dad. No one else, no grandparents, no uncles or aunts. I picked up cleaning the house and cooking right after mom died too. My dad is a cop and I don't want him coming home to canned food or junk food, and I always make him lunch. We are very close, I'm really happy even though it's just the two of us. Even with his work hours, I never feel abandoned, and he's also the type who isn't afraid to show his affection, something that he always reminds me: ""Men can have emotion and feelings too, so don't be embarrassed"". He always makes sure I do my homework and if I can't do some questions, he will even learn it so he can teach me.

&amp;#x200B;

An now and he starts spending time with a woman who works at the restaurant across him. I don't like it, even though she's really nice. I feel me &amp; my dad already have this routine and if she comes into our lives, she will ruin that routine. I feel like I'm childish but that's how I feel. I want him to be happy but I'm really scared. What if he spends time with her and forgets about me? From what I've seen on TV, they will be all lovey-dovey and he will start to move on from me and mom. From the perfectly good routine that we have. I'm not even sure I want a new mom. We can survive this long without a mom.

&amp;#x200B;

I can't talk to anyone else, I'm afraid they will mock me because I'm a boy and I can't be this scared and sensitive towards my dad. I really want him to be happy...

&amp;#x200B;

**tl;dr I think my dad is dating again it makes me sad, I don't want to confront him because I don't want him to think I'm selfish and don't want him to be happy.**"
"Girlfriend [25F] eats my food/prepped meals without telling me [26M]. Fed up with coming home to empty fridges.


I know this seems like a dumb issue but I’ve talked to her about this SO many times and it never sticks. I’m so annoyed at coming home again and again to an empty fridge. I’m completely ok with making extra food but she never tells me what she wants and never tells me when we’re running low either. 

So yesterday I came home after work to find my prepped meals for the week all gone. There were like 2 meals left and my gf admits she had one for lunch and then left the last one in her office fridge at work. I’m unbelievably upset because these were my dinners for the rest of the week. I’m trying to lose weight and cut down on fats so the meals were carefully made. 

I asked my girlfriend why and she doesn’t think it’s a huge deal. She says it’s just food and I should just make more so there’s enough for both of us. I tell her I would make more but she always tells me my meals look gross and to not make her any so I obviously listen. Then later in the week she pulls something like this and neglects to even text me when I’m on my way home. 

I then end up with nothing for dinner and having to drive out miles to a local grocery store. It’s beyond infuriating and she thinks I’m stingy and overreacting over food. 

How do I set boundaries when it comes to my prepped meal? I’m really tired of coming home to zero food in the fridge while she acts like she did nothing wrong...

Tl;Dr- Girlfriend eats all my prepped weekly meals without telling me, leaving me to come home to no food frequently. But still says no when I’m cooking and I ask her if she wants some for herself. How do I set boundaries when she keeps ignoring my wishes??"
"My [32M] gf [28F] used to have a life


When we first started dating, my girlfriend had a career she was proud of, friends she saw frequently, hobbies that kept her physically active, and she ran a side business she was passionate about with her best friend.

That was 3 years ago, she's since lost her job and has been unemployed/underemployed for the bulk of our relationship. She's stopped seeing her friends as often, stopped working out, and her side gig is in limbo.

It's clear that she is experiencing at least some level of depression, and I'm trying to be supportive. But my work and commute has me occupied at least 12 hours a day. 

We text all day while I'm at work, and as soon as I get home we are on the phone for at least an hour at night, usually more. We also see each other several nights a week.

It's starting to wear on me, the amount of attention she needs has me neglecting my own needs and feeling selfish for it. I can't be her only pillar of support anymore. She used to be such a fulfilled person, how do I get her to be independent again?

**TL;DR** My girlfriend used to have a life outside of me, how do I help her build herself up again?"
"My [33M] wife [32F] of 13 years broke up a marriage


About a year and a half ago, my wife (Tessa) became friends with  higher up at her work (Chris, 45M).  He seemed to lean on her emotionally and talked about his failing marriage of 20 years with 45F and would ask her for advice.  I was weirded out at how close they got so quickly but she insisted he just wanted advice to make his marriage better.  My wife is beautiful, smart, and successful.  It's easy for me to assume many men want her, but this just seemed off.

I started to notice that Chris's actions affected Tessa quite a lot.  She admitted that he could be cruel and manipulative and she would get REALLY upset when this happened.  I also started to sense that Chris was probably interested in Tessa as more than a confidant.

A few months ago, I found texts from Tessa to Chris telling him she loves him, like romantically.  I confronted her and she claimed she was drunk (true), didn't mean it, and was just feeling thankful to him for helping her with something career-wise.  She apologized to me and also to him and told him she didn't mean it.  She offered to cut contact with him.  I told her I didn't care if they talked if it was career-related.

Well, recently, everything seemed to have exploded.  Tessa was asleep and her friend [32F] gave me her phone and told me to look.  I saw texts between Tessa and another friend [45F] where Tessa said ""I wish I could just tell my husband so he could choose to leave me if he wants.""  They were talking about Chris.

I asked her wtf that meant.  At first she wouldn't answer.  Then she came to me and told me that Chris had kissed her last year.  She says nothing else happened.  I have no idea if that's true.  She offered to cut contact again and also offered therapy and has been a model wife lately--loving and affectionate, doing more domestic chores than usual.  She has left her phone and computer open to me.  I really do think she is trying.  

But here's the thing.  Apparently someone informed Chris's wife that there was something going on between Tessa and Chris.  His wife informed HR and he may or may not be let go.  Apparently his marriage really was on life support and his wife decided that him putting their family at risk (by risking his job for whatever he had with my wife) was the last straw, so she is divorcing him. 

So this is where I'm conflicted.  My wife is partly responsible for breaking up another marriage and also for a man potentially losing his job.  It's hard for me to believe this is over a kiss.

But I'm not sure whether I need to know or not.  We have a good relationship.  We are best friends, have great sex, parent well together, and make a great team.  I know I can't be with her if she's in love with this guy, but she hasn't spoken to him since all this went down.  (I've checked.)  I'm also concerned about her low-key drinking issue.  She's in a profession where alcoholism is common and I see her drinking to deal with issues.  I'm just not sure what to do.  I love her but I feel like it's a LOT to deal with and between the texts and this guy's marriage ending BECAUSE of my wife, I don't know if I have it in me to stay.

**tl;dr:  wife ""kissed"" someone else, his wife found out and is leaving him.  She's been genuinely remorseful but I'm not sure what to do.**"
"I'm [30M] and my wife's [28] friends hate me so much, they want her to divorce with me


My wife and I had a quarrel. I have been asking her to watch movies with me, but she's always not interested. Her colleague \[30M\] a married man, asked her for a movie and she decided to watch with him, despite going through some hassle too. Before this incident, alot of other events of her treating me unfairly and build up on me. I thought about all of them and I was angry, so I scolded her, and questioned her- why the double standard.  


She told her friends about me scolding her and played the victim and excluded alot of her wrong doings. They told her that it was just a movie and if I could scold her now, I could do more than that in the future. They\[28-31F\] said alot of nasty things about me and I thought we were friends. They asked her to leave the marriage and leave the house etc. To me, that was absurd. My wife did something wrong and yet they are asking her to divorce me!?

&amp;#x200B;

My wife also broke the promise. 4 years ago we had an argument and she told one of her ex-friend bad things about me, and she asked her to leave me too. After that incident, we managed to solve the issue and she made a promise to never ever share with her friends our relationship issues. But now, she shared with 3 of them! And even on social media.

&amp;#x200B;

Right now, we have calmed down slightly. And I told her - ""Your friends are enemies of our marriage. They just want to watch it burned. And If you had really listened to them, then our marriage is over. They did not even know about the full picture of our quarrel and how unfairly I have been treated, yet they insisted you to divorce me."" She told me that they did nothing wrong, because they did not know about the full picture of our quarrel. So I told her ""what gave them the rights to tear our marriage apart then? Since they did not even know of the full story"" She continued to side them and claimed its not their fault. I know she is being selfish again, she doesn't want their friendship to be ruined, so she sided with them.

&amp;#x200B;

Thus I told myself I had enough, I gave her the ultimatum. I asked her to choose her friends (enemies of our marriage) or this marriage. She said she wanted both, I told her if she wants them both then I would choose to leave this marriage instead. Because even her friendship (bad people) can mean more than this marriage. And she insisted she wants both. Dear Reddit, I have never felt so sorry for myself and I do not know why to turn to. Because I know that I should never tell my friends bad things about my wife too. Thus I am here, requesting opinions and help from you all. Thank you very much for reading.

&amp;#x200B;

 **TL;DR:** I'm \[30M\] and my wife's \[28\] friends hate me so much, they want her to divorce with me.  She continued to side them and I let her choose between the marriage or the friends. She want both. I told her if she wants them both, then I would leave.

"I 27/F was at my uncles wedding where my father [50's/M] attended with his new family and completely ignored me. This has brought up past resentments, pain and I'm incredibly vulnerable and fragile right now..


Hey guys so this is pretty painful to post but these past few days have been absolutely agonizing. My uncle's wedding was on the 22nd, I knew my father was coming but I had no idea it would really hurt me the way it did.

&amp;#x200B;

My father has been absent from my life since the age of 1..they got divorced when I was super young and the ugly divorce didn't leave me much to work with in terms of having a relationship with my father. After my mother was unable to pay rent and we were thrown out of numerous apartments, I was passed on to my grand parents. I've been living with them since and It's been not the best.

&amp;#x200B;

During my teenage years my father would visit his mother with his new family on days I would be in school or visiting my mom. It was my cousin who mentioned to me that I had siblings and that they came on days I was not here. I eventually confronted my father and it went downhill. I was 10.

&amp;#x200B;

My high school years were hell. I hated him. I lost my grand father who was like my father and emotionally I learned to be more dependent on myself. My father would pop in here and there but I felt like he used my grandma as the middle woman to find out what I was up to. Since my emotional breakdown caused me to suffer in school, he chose not to speak to me.

&amp;#x200B;

When I got into college he started to intiate more contact. When I graduated he tried to come into my life full time. it's not the same. There's no connection. He co signed for my car, disappeared, would buy me expensive bags and jewelry and then never talk to me.

&amp;#x200B;

Now for the wedding..there he was with my brother (who was obviously coached before-hand that I would be there so was super awkward with me) introducing him to everyone and I say separately. It was hurtful, demeaning and incredibly disrespectful. Ia was in tears but held it together. I figured I cannot ruin my uncle's big day. So I swallowed the pain but after mentioned to my grandmother that I was hurt and wanted nothing to do with him.

&amp;#x200B;

Yes, he co-signed for my car and that's what's keeping us tied but I make all of the payments and never asked him for a penny. I am planning on moving out (currently looking for my own place) and I really cannot believe that he would just ignore me. My grandmother told him how I felt and he is trying to make up for it by offering to buy me a bag I always wanted. I refused. I am no longer 13, he will not buy his way out of this one. I'm in pain.

&amp;#x200B;

tl-dr: I 27/F attended a wedding where my father 50s/m was there was his new family and completely ignored me. He is trying to buy my affection back but I am done. I am so hurt and I never want to speak to him again ..

"My boyfriend[25M]of 1 year threw the plate of food I[23F] was eating in the trash. Am I overreacting?


So I had been asking my boyfriend (1year) for about 3 hours what/if he wanted to eat. Every time he answered with no or I’m not hungry. So eventually I end up heating myself up food and start eating. He comes out to see me eating and loses it. Says I’m being selfish because I couldn’t heat his food up with mine/first. Say I didn’t think he was hungry and offer to heat up said food, he rejects it and keeps saying he can’t believe I’d do that and that now he is starving. After arguing and asking what he wanted to eat with no avail, I go back to eating the food I made for myself. After a few minutes he stands up, walks over, takes the plate from in front of me and throws the whole thing in the trash. And needless to say after that I lost it. Am I overreacting because I am staying away from him until he apologizes or at least shows the least bit of remorse? Every time I bring it up he just says I was being lazy and selfish. I need other unbiased opinions please!

**TL;DR: Boyfriend is calling me selfish because I heated up my own food before his. Retaliates by throwing my food in the garbage.**"
"Should I [28f] friend break-up with someone [32f] who (indirectly) asked me for money after we hung out three times?


I decided to try out BumbleBFF this year. I \[28F\] met this one girl \[32 f\] and we clicked pretty instantly. We hung out a total of three times over the course of about two weeks and she was so coool. We had a ton in common. I was very excited to make a new friend. 

So she texted me one day last week. We're both on dating apps so we'd been sending each other some screen shots of the hilarious messages we'd received. So she sent me a screen shot of some Tinder dude saying something crazy, which led to us chatting for a bit. THEN she brings up how her landlady said she could pay rent late, but actually needs the money today, and she doesn't have the 300 bucks she needs to pay it. 

We're both English as a foreign language teachers, and work is scarce in summer. I know neither one of us worked during August. I could have found something like nannying or doing some private lessons during August if I'd needed to, but having a whole month off was way more appealing. Most English teaching jobs here are on a per hour basis, meaning you don't get paid for your days off. Life is pretty cheap here and English teachers are paid well so it's never been a problem for me. Also I've always been good with money and save some of my paycheck every month. 

So of course I was like Oh no that sucks, and trying to help by offering different solutions, like can you ask your boss for an advance? Can you talk to your landlady and see if you can work something out? Can you ask your parents for money? Can you pick up some private classes for some extra money? She says no to all that, tells me she can't ask her parents, she already asked her exboyfriend who said no, etc. etc. She didn't outright ask me for the money, but it felt pretty clear that she was trying to get me to offer to give her the money. Like ""ohhhh I don't know what to do I have no options."" I felt bad for her but I didn't offer her any money. I'm not gonna give money to someone I've hung out with three times.

After that I didn't hear from her for a couple of days, then I texted her again and asked how she was. She tells me she's doing OK, but she still needs 100 bucks. 

I know it's possible, maybe even likely, that she's actually going through a tough time financially. In fact she did tell me when we hung out that she's had money problems before and had to take out pay day loans and is now ignoring the creditors. Also she said she goes on dates for free meals a lot. Also she told me some story about being between apartments and needing a place to stay and being mad at her friend who lived alone didn't offer her to stay there while she looked. Also she said she hasn't paid her taxes in years because the government won't care. So when I think about all those things in addition, maybe this might be too chaotic of a friendship to bring into my life? I certainly don't want to judge her for being bad with money or whatever. But what 32 year old doesn't have 300 bucks? She could have found SOMETHING during August to make money if she knew she was short on cash. And her rent is the one of the cheapest in the city. I have no idea how she landed a place for 300.

I also felt super uncomfortable with her putting me in the position where she wanted me to offer her money. I'm 28 and I've literally never been asked for money before, directly or implied, so red flags are going up. 

She just texted me asking if I want to hang out on Friday. I'm not sure what I should say/do. I feel sad this this got complicated so quickly. Because I thought I'd made a cool friend.

**TL;DR: Met a girl on BumbleBFF and we hung out three times. She texted me saying she doesn't know what to do, she can't pay her rent, no one can help her. Didn't directly ask me for money but it felt super implied. I've never been asked for money before so red flags are going up a bit. She just texted me asking to hang out again. What should I do?**"
"Boyfriend (27m) is ignoring my texts after I (25f) brought up an issue once again


I'm going to try not to make this post too long

My boyfriend and I have been dating for 3 years. He's a small business owner so he uses social media to market his store.

The problem is that he can be flirty. About 2 months ago I broke it off with him because he used his business account to comment something super flirty and sexual on a girl's naked picture. He begged and pleaded and said he'd to anything to fix our relationship, he stopped using the account and took down the photos and comments. So we got back together.

Since then he's tried to be better. But I also asked him to stop liking naked and otherwise provocative photos. His defense was that no one knows who runs his multiple accounts so it's not a big deal but he'd stop if it really bothered me. I said it did.

Recently he liked another naked pick and commented saying he loved the capture. I called him out on it he said he meant the actual photo, how it was taken, it was a very artsy photo. And he apologized. But then I told him he also liked a few very porny pics, nothing artsy about it. He had no comment but said he felt like he was improving. I told him I disagreed but we left it.

Last week I find out some girl messaged one of his pages and asked for a pic of him and this dumbass actually sent her one, then sent me a screenshot of the convo saying he stopped talking to her because he felt she was flirting and he wanted to be open and honest with me. Wtf? He actually got offended that I was upset. I tomd him he doesn't get brownie points for continuing a conversation that's clearly going in a flirty direction and then telling me about it. He apologized again.

Now last night I text him saying goodnight, he replied the same and I said I thought he was calling. He never replied which was weird. Then I go on Instagram and see he's been liking more porny photos. I send him screenshot and say I'm upset and would rather cancel our date today, I say I thought we had an agreement but it's clear he doesn't plan on sticking to it. Again, he never replied. It's now noon and I see he's active on IG liking photos and following people but has not replied to me

I'm tired of this. Sick and tired. What do I do? Do I just tell him we're done and ghost him?

Tl;Dr boyfriend agreed to not like naked pic or provocative pics of girls on IG but keeps doing it and apologizing. He did it again last night and has been ignoring my texts. What do I do? "
"The guy [36M] I've been flirting with has been telling people I'm [35F] 'stalking' him. Do I clear my name?


So I met Jeff at the beginning of the summer at a mutual friend's art show. We had amazing chemistry and got coffee together after. Nothing happened as far as physical contact but we exchanged numbers. I live in NYC and he lives about 2 hours away in NJ, so our 'relationship' after that was over text and Instagram and FB messenger.

We were in constant contact all summer, with him turning conversations sexual, calling me amazing, telling me he missed me, calling me beautiful, sexy, cute, gorgeous, etc. Things were very obviously flirtatious and very obviously mutual- in fact, he actually contacted me WAY more than I contacted him.

Over the past few weeks he said he's been busy, so I've just been sending him messages as they come up; funny pictures I think he'd like, thoughts I had about him, etc. This is normal, he did it when I was busy with work, too. But last night I got a message from a woman I had never heard about, saying she was his girlfriend, and that he told her I'd been stalking him, and to 'take a hint' and leave him alone.

Obviously I didn't know he had a girlfriend at all and he NEVER mentioned her. I reached out to our mutual friends (all men) to ask if they knew he had a girlfriend and they were all uncomfortable and were like, 'Yeah, Jeff has told us you've been totally crazy and stalking him but we didn't know what to say since it seemed personal, he asked us not to say anything to you.' 

Apparently this whole time he's been telling everyone I'm some crazy lovestruck woman who won't take a hint who has been bothering him. I'm devastated and embarrassed and now I'm not sure whether I should just drop this at the risk of looking 'crazier' or if I should post some screenshots of our conversations that prove that our romantic 'thing' was VERY mutual and often instigated by him.

TL'DR: A guy I've been flirting with secretly had a girlfriend and has been telling people I'm crazy and obsessed with him. I have tons of proof that our flirting was mutual and often led by him, but I'm afraid belaboring this will just make me look crazier."
"My dad (59/M) is always squealing and he will not stop


Hi Reddit,

I know some of you will laugh and smile while reading this (and I don't blame you) but this is actually a very serious problem, just now he turned a light switch on and squealed in astonishment/delight. When he is watching a movie and an action scene comes on he will do a really high pitched squeal scream. My mum has talked to him about it but he just will not stop. Every day occurrences make him squeal, from a meal being ready to a knock on the door. It is really irritating and this behaviour only just started within the last two years or so. Has anyone else dealt with this? It is very uncomfortable to hear a man of almost 60 squeal/scream in a high pitched tone when something mundane happens. He even does it when he is out at dinner, to waitresses! It is highly embarrassing. It has gotten to the point that everyone is walking on egg shells around him, just waiting for him to let it rip.

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR: Dad of almost 60 years old will not stop squealing/screaming in a high pitched tone."
"What on earth could be causing my (37f) husband's (41m) outbursts?


He often will do this thing where he's in an obviously pissy mood and suddenly will look for reasons to get angry.




An example of this happened today. He's been in a bad mood all day (work related) and went out to the grocery store this evening. When he came home, he immediately became angry that my son had left the computer screen on. This quickly escalated into him saying nobody cares enough to look after the stuff he buys, and he went up to our son's room and started getting mad about random things (his camera wasn't put away properly, something else was laying on the floor, his light was left on, etc).




Then he went into our daughter's room and got mad at her for random things.  Then it slides into him calling them ungrateful and taking away privileges (which never sticks anyway because he doesn't actually even mean it).





These weird outbursts happen randomly but pretty regularly, with no explanation.  Once he came down into the playroom and seemed ok but quickly got upset because it was a ""mess"" (it was a bit messy, but it's a playroom) and just started escalating, getting angry about everything and insisting the kids do a deep clean of the playroom right that minute.





It's always when he's obviously upset about other things, but then he'll start in on something around the house that's bugging him and it just snowballs. I dread these outbursts, because he's illogical and starts getting angry about everything (the kids forgot to load the dishwasher, nobody put away the guitar, why on earth did I buy this rug??).







Is this normal? I'm sincerely perplexed. I have never once (that I can recall) had one of these outbursts where I start freaking out about everything.  My parents never did this either. I have no explanation for this behaviour but it's very tiresome.  





**tldr. husband has random ""freak outs"" where he gets mad over all sorts of things that we are or are not doing correctly**"
"My [28 F] boyfriend [36 M] hit me hard enough to leave marks on my face, and I don't know what to tell my coworkers.


This is embarrassing and painful to even write, but after a three year relationship, my boyfriend hit me. He's had anger issues in the past, but this was the first time he's been violent towards me. Something snapped. We weren't even arguing over anything that serious. He pushed me into a door and then dragged me by my hair onto the floor and kicked my face. 

What I'm really worried about is going to work tomorrow. My face is swollen and cut. No amount of makeup will help hide this. I think I might tell my coworkers I was in a car accident tonight. I can't call off sick. There are a couple meetings that I really can't miss.

What can I tell my coworkers? We're a small agency and they would definitely make a comment about my appearance if they saw me like this. 

tl;dr: not sure how to explain the bruises and cuts my ex-boyfriend gave me to my coworkers"
"My (22, M) girlfriend (19,F) of 10 months kissed a randomer in a club. Should I forgive her?


So I’ve been going out with this girl for 10 months and it’s honestly been otherwise an amazing relationship, but I had my first red flag popping up a few months ago when some friends of mine said she was flirting with other guys. I’m in the military so while the time we spend together is great, there’s a lot of time that I don’t get to see her. I never had any doubts at all and we were both adamant we would never cheat, but I got my first red flag when my friends told me she was flirting back with guys in bars and clubs. I get it’s not cheating but it pissed me off because I was worried what it might lead to...

So 2 nights ago she tells me that she went out with her flatmates and got black out drunk, to the point that she doesn’t remember anything at all and had to be carried out the club. She was shown a picture of herself the next day getting with a guy, and apparently they were together a while and went to a different club. She swears nothing else happened and I believe her, but just the act itself of kissing another guy, and not just a little peck has put me in a spin.

I told her that I’d need a few days to clear my head and evaluate afterwards whether I want to stay with her, and she’s given me the space to do just that. 
 
And so I have a few questions for the sub:

Is kissing in a club cheating?
Does it make it any better that she was black out drunk and doesn’t remember anything?
And most importantly, from experience, is it the sort of thing that leads to more things?

She’s so apologetic and is in absolute bits about it, and promises nothing like this will happen again, but am I just being naive in believing her? 

TLDR; gf got with a stranger in a club whilst black out drunk and doesn’t remember any of it. Is it a forgivable offence and what is the likelihood of the same or worse happening again??"
"My [22F] boyfriend [22M] of a year and a half is exhausted by the negative things happening in my life and I don't even know what to think about it. What do I do?


Last night, my boyfriend of 1.5 years and I were talking on the phone and I made a stupid joke and he said, ""You're so fucking annoying."" I was surprised and told him to watch his words, I don't like him talking to me that way. Later, I texted him that I'm really upset by the fact that he has been calling me annoying lately and saying things of the sort.

&amp;#x200B;

He took forever to message me back, but when he did a couple hours later, it was this:

&amp;#x200B;

*ive been thinking about it and I realized that I feel like an emotional dumpster for you. i know ur going thru a hard time, and i’m here to support u. however, i feel like my life is pretty fuckin awesome rn and the only thing that has been negatively affecting me has been the load that i get from you. i usually dont get annoyed but lately there’s been a heavier load than usual. it can be exhausting hearing all these negative things all the time and i obviously love u and want to support u honey! it’s rly difficult to even tell u this because i dont want you to feel bad about feeling bad all the time cause i 10000% understand why*

&amp;#x200B;

For context, I am a really positive person who has been beat down by life. In the past 6 months my dad has died, I have moved countries, I have been homeless, I have had an abortion, I've been in an ongoing lawsuit over a car crash that almost killed me, I have graduated, I have had to hold shitty jobs...

&amp;#x200B;

I'm really upset over what he said, but I know that I should probably not be because he has been through everything with me. I just don't even know what to think? I cannot talk to any of my friends right now because they are all in a completely different timezone. Any opinions, dear internet? Do you think he wants to break up or should I stop telling him my problems?

&amp;#x200B;

**TLDR;** My boyfriend is tired of all the negative things that have been happening in my life. What do I say to him?"
"SIL [25 F] is lying about nursing school and stealing my [29 F] thunder!


TL;DR:
My [29] brother [26] married a sociopath [25] who lied about being in nursing school and is now threatening to ruin our family holidays and my nursing school celebration.

When we first met my now SIL 2 years ago, she told us she was in nursing school at a university that is notoriously difficult to get into--it was actually my first choice! (I ended up at a different school and I graduate in December 2018. Woot!) 

I had researched her program extensively before I applied to it, and SIL told me a lot of things that didn't add up. I gave her the benefit of the doubt, and I felt I owed it to my brother to make an effort with his wife. Over the next year, I sent her articles and internship opportunities she might be interested in. She posted pics of her ""study grind"" and even her semester grades on Instagram. 

She and my brother live about 5 hours away--when she comes in, my entire family brags about her. They *see* how hard I work and the sacrifices I've made and assume that she's doing the same. SIL has generated a lot of drama when people have been unable to accommodate her schedule, but she's under a lot of stress and they just brush it off.

Last Christmas, my mom wanted to get SIL some compression socks, and other nurse-y things, so I pulled up the handbook I had downloaded (from when I was looking at their program) to see if there was a certain color socks mentioned in the dress code. I couldn't find anything so I went to the school's Facebook to look at their uniforms. I stumbled across photos of each incoming class, and of course I looked for SIL. Nowhere to be found. I told my mom that something was weird. 

My brother was deployed most of last year, so I'm not sure if he knows what is actually going on. (To be perfectly frank, he's a little dense anyway. I love him to death, but man...) I do know she got all her books/tuition covered by the military, and they both decided she should quit her job to focus on school full-time. My parents even covered some of their bills. 

When SIL was gifted the socks and a monogrammed clinical bag, she confessed that she had failed and would now be graduating in December 2018 (same time as me) instead of May 2018. She ""hadn't started clinicals yet"" 3 semesters into the program. I knew that it absolutely was not my place to call her out. I went along with it. 

In May of this year, I decided to send her a letter of encouragement for finals, so I looked up the exam schedule (publicly available online). She said thanks, but finals were the previous week. Then she blocked me on Instagram and restricted her Facebook so I can only see public posts. My mom and brother said ""oh, well, they reschedule a lot of things in her program."" I was livid, so I called the school (didn't impersonate anyone, just tried to sound professional) and asked point-blank if they could confirm she was a student. Nope. Never has been. 

The last week of November, my family is doing a mega holiday (because of everyone's schedule, including my brother's deployment) that will be Thanksgiving, mini-Hannukah and a (slightly premature) celebration for my graduation. It has been decided that my SIL and I will be the guests of honor at the nursing-themed gathering. We have family flying in from all over the country, so my mom went all out--rented a space, photographer, professionally done cake with both our names. All that to make SIL feel special and included. What in the hell do I do?

"I told my (41F) husband (43M) a story about a mild annoyance and he said it shows I have “Serious Character Flaws” and that I am unbelievably selfish. Am I horrible?


My BFF Of 20+ years moved about 5 months ago, about 1000 miles away. The hubs and I have good friends who live in the area BFF was moving to, and they had met once before the move. 

So the friend wife (FW) and BFF have been spending a TON of time together - which I get - they are both my friends for a reason and I’m truly happy that they hit it off and that BFF has someone to hang out with in her new area. 

BFF ended up back in town briefly on business, so I got to see her for the first time since she left!!! Yay happy reunion! She had a couple of hours free the first evening and came by our house. The second evening she couldn’t make it out to where we were (had early morning obligations about an hour or two away) so I drove out to spend a couple of hours with her since she was leaving the next day. 

So FW called and talked to BFF on the phone as she was driving from her work event to meet with me - they spoke for about 1/2 hour or so. BFF told FW I was driving out and we had a couple of hours to spend together. 

While we were catching up FW was texting BFF incessantly (kind of her thing) really random stuff - weird stuff about FW’s work, and random GIFs. Then asked BFF if she wanted to call her as she drove home from work. (About 1/2 hour again). BFF said that she was pretty tired but would talk to FW tomorrow. Response: “k”. 

I offhandedly mentioned this to Husband along the lines of “Sheesh lady you get her all of the time now, chill out on the texts while I have a couple of hours after not seeing her for months.”

Husband then tells me that this is evidence of a “SERIOUS CHARACTER FLAW” on my part, and that I am unbelievably selfish and should have just included myself in the text conversation (it wasn’t a group text) and how dare I be such a bitch. And what is the matter with me. For 20 minutes he reiterates what a “SERIOUS CHARACTER FLAW” this is, even after I asked him to stop. I finally said that I saw his point, just to get him to stop beating the dead horse. (He still got a couple of digs in after this, and after I asked him to stop, again.)

Am I crazy? 

Tl;dr - I was mildly annoyed at a friend (who sees my BFF all of the time) for incessantly texting/calling my BFF during the couple of hours that we got to spend together after she moved away months ago. Husband says that makes me a horrible, selfish human. "
"My grandma died and I feel like my girlfriend's behaviour towards me and my family was out of line [28/29F 2 year relationship]


 Hi Reddit. Sorry this is all over the place. I’m pretty tired and upset, and am having a hard time getting my thoughts together..but here it goes.

My grandma (dad’s mom) and I didn’t have the greatest relationship. Basically my dad’s family was super crazy rich and my mom’s family is like upper middle class. So my grandma wasn’t super thrilled with the marriage. She treats my mom differently than her other daughter/son in laws and this kind of trickled down to me and my brother being treated differently than our cousins.

My grandma wasn’t outright mean to us, but it was kind of obvious she had favourites in the way that she didn’t give us as good gifts as the other grandkids, she never bragged about our accomplishments to her friends, she’d tell me that I could lose some weight, etc. But I mean… she did still give us gifts, cook our favourite foods when she came to visit, came to our graduations, lots of hugs and kisses..so I feel like she did love us. She was also an old Asian lady, so some of her actions can be attributed to just her being of her generation. I guess it doesn’t matter now, bottom line – I had things to complain about but in the end I do love my grandma.

My grandma was in the hospital and my dad knew that she was not doing so well, so he asked me to fly out to my hometown and see her. All of my cousins, aunts and uncles came as well and we had a really lovely family reunion (I am super close to my extended family, but we all live in different states in the US/provinces in Canada so we don’t see each other much but it’s always awesome when we do) and my grandma was so happy. My girlfriend and I already had plane tickets to visit my parents, so we actually ended up going back to hometown a couple of weeks after that. Grandma was still in the hospital and my girlfriend met her for the first time. She died about a week after we left and I flew out again to go to the funeral and wake. So I went there 3 times (twice alone, once with my gf) and each time I was just…not impressed with my girlfriend’s actions

**First visit**

This was a last minute flight and was pretty expensive, so my girlfriend decided not to come with me. Also we thought it wouldn’t be the best situation for her to meet my family for the first time. I was only gone for the weekend (left Friday night, came back Sunday afternoon) and my girlfriend was insistent that I text constantly, call her every night, Skype every morning. I tried my best to text her, but I didn’t really want to be on my phone the entire time I was at the hospital visiting my grandma and also catching up with family I hadn’t seen in a couple of years. It was evening and my phone was nearly dead. My grandma was asleep, so my brother and cousins and I decided to drive to the mall/grocery store. My girlfriend got so angry at me because I didn’t call her at the hospital, I didn’t call her while I was in the car (with 7 other people), my phone died and I didn’t borrow someone else’s phone to call her at the mall, etc. She then also kind of got mad at me for taking the opportunity while my grandma was asleep to have a good time with my cousins instead of calling/video chatting her. I skyped her the next morning and she was still livid and accused me of doing something that I would never do and was actually really insulting. Anyway I went back home the next day and she was still mad at me.

**Second visit**

This visit was planned before my grandma got sick and my gf met my extended family for the first time. She hated every second of it. My cousins tried to include her by asking what food she’d like to eat so we could pick a restaurant and she just said that we (she and I) would go back to my parents house and eat there (there was no food, we ate cereal for dinner). When we were alone, she’d get mad at me for having fun, laughing, and singing with my cousins. She was sulky the entire time and at one point was in such a bad mood around my family that she said that when we got back home we were breaking up. It then de-escalated to we are never going to a family reunion type thing ever again. She would text her sister about how weird/creepy/embarrassing my family was and when my aunt and uncle celebrated their wedding anniversary, she insisted that we skip the lunch celebration and drive downtown instead.

**Third visit**

A few days after we got home from the 2nd visit, my dad called me to tell me that my grandma had passed away that morning and if I could make it home that weekend for the funeral and wake and that my girlfriend was invited too, of course. She couldn’t take more time off work and also couldn’t afford the plane ticket, so I went by myself. My girlfriend never outright said I couldn’t go, but it was obvious that she didn’t want me to ditch her again. She said things like “You didn’t even like your grandma that much why do you have to go to the funeral AND the wake”. But screw that, even if I didn’t like my grandma I would still want to be there for my dad and the rest of my family. At the funeral home (for the wake), I was texting her a bit and taking pictures of some of my grandma’s stuff. I was also chatting with my cousins and my brother. We decided to go into the chapel (I didn’t really have signal in here) and I saw my aunt really crying and sobbing and I went to go give her a hug. The wake then started and I took a seat at a pew for the mass and other things. It lasted about 1 ½ hours, and when I got out, I received a ton of messages that my gf had sent that I couldn’t receive in the chapel. Basically she was mad at me for not texting her good night immediately before the wake started. I told her that I was in a chapel, so I didn’t really have the chance to text her. She said that it only takes a few seconds to text “good night” so I should have taken my phone out during the church service and texted. But honestly…texting her good night was not the most important thing on my mind during my grandma’s wake.

The next day was the funeral. I was telling my girlfriend that the shoes I had brought were dirty so I had to borrow my mom’s shoes with heels. She then texted me “Wow, the image of you in heels is such a turn-off”. Wtf I wasn’t telling her that I was wearing heels to turn her on, I was just telling her something about my day. After the funeral, my cousins and I decided to go play a game of basketball. I called my girlfriend to talk to her and when she heard the sounds of the game in the background she got angry and accused me of “having fun”. Am I not allowed to have fun? My grandma was super into family and loved having everyone together, so us playing a fun game of basketball would probably be exactly what she had wanted us to do.

This has gotten really long now. So I’ll just end it here. What I need help from you guys is..did I do something wrong? Maybe my judgement is all clouded because my grandma died, I spent so much time with family, I had to fly back and forth across the country three times in a month. Am I completely missing my gf's side of the story? I honestly don’t know what to think, but I know that I feel like crap.

TL;DR: My girlfriend gets mad at me for having fun with my cousins, she hates my family, got incredibly angry at me for picking my grandma’s funeral over texting her."
"I (28F) don't really want to be married anymore to my husband (28M) of 3 years (total relationship length = 5 years), but I don't know if I care enough to quit.


My husband is a nice guy and I think he really likes his life with me, our two dogs and one-year-old daughter. He does a lot of stuff for us (good job, helps with chores, helps with baby) and I think we do a really good job of getting things done in life successfully and efficiently. We almost never fight because we're just THAT GOOD/REASONABLE at navigating everything life has thrown at us.

However, in my opinion, we have almost no romantic relationship whatsoever. Somehow we had a kid (it literally only takes one time, guys) and apart from that we have zero sexual relationship. We don't kiss, hold hands or say romantic things to each other, I haven't said ""I love you"" in a while because I don't know if I really mean it in a romantic sense. This has been the case for years. I have long stopped trying to initiate sex or trying to organize activities for us because it's too much effort to get turned down and I'm too tired to care most days. We definitely don't hate each other but we're definitely more ""not mean"" to each other than ""nice"" to each other. 

I've always thought about breaking up in the back of my mind... but then we got a house together.... then we got a dog.... then we got another dog.... then I got pregnant, now I feel like I'm too far in. I keep rationalizing that romance isn't everything and that, on paper, my life seems great. I should be grateful and happy. I keep going back and forth thinking that I should say something, then changing my mind and not feeling strongly about it to do anything. I don't want to say anything I can't take back, but I don't think this situation is going to change and I really am not liking how my life is turning out. 

...but I don't want to abandon my family, either. The only person I really have positive feelings about these days is my daughter. Is it ridiculous to wish that my husband would be OK with ending our romantic relationship and just keep doing everything else the same? That seems selfish... but seriously I would be thrilled if we could stop pretending we want to make things better, romantically, because I really don't anymore.   


Tl:dr I have no feelings about the romantic portion of my relationship anymore but everything else is OK. Is that enough to undo all the things we have built up together?"
"Husband has had enough of houseguest


In February this year my sister passed away from cancer. She was only 26, she was my best friend and it was two weeks before her wedding day. Staff arranged a civil ceremony in her hospital room the day she died so that she could be married to the man she loved, he was just 23 at the time. 

Originally my brother-in-law planned to stay in the house he and my sister had shared but soon found it too lonely and upsetting. He decided to travel the world to fulfil some of the plans he and my sister had had together and asked if he could stay with me (33F) and my husband (33M) for ""a while"".  I was 5 months pregnant with our first child and missing my sister so I was happy to have him stay for the extra support we provided each other during a tough time. 

At the beginning my BIL talked about travelling at the end of May but I had our daughter and he still hadn't booked any flights or decided on a starting destination. My husband started to get stressed with my BIL's presence, he wanted it to just be us and our newborn and wanted a date set for BIL travels to begin. I hinted at booking flights and looking into vaccinations and finally flights were booked at the end of August. 

Now, less than a month later my BIL has messaged to say he's coming back end of November and not going travelling again until ""maybe March"". He also specifically mentioned Christmas and asked could he spend it with us. Husband only knows about Christmas so far but has told me that BIL cannot spend Christmas with us as husband's parents are coming to stay from across the country and he doesn't want other guests (spare room is not a factor). Husband says if BIL is going to be here for Christmas we will be going to stay at his parents instead. I don't want to do that for several reasons but I don't know how to approach any of this with my BIL! 

I want my BIL to feel welcome at our home and part of our family but also understand that he needs to find a place of his own. I love having him here but my husband's mental health definitely deteriorated during his stay (previous problems with depression flared again) so I want to back him on this. How do I sort this out?! 

TLDR - husband is sick of widowed brother-in-law staying with us and specifically doesn't want him here at Christmas"
"My (29) husband (29)with anxiety is ruining our marriage


TL:DR at the bottom, sorry it just got so long. 


My husband (29) and myself (29) have been married for almost 6 years. I’ve been a very patient wife. The last few years have just continued to worsen his social anxiety. He has a lot of trouble leaving the house aside from work.  His work is exactly 1.2 miles from home. He is on medication. 

I work about 10 miles from home. I often get caught in traffic or have days I am running late from work (I’m a nurse). I can’t help being late most days - I have patients. I do everything I can to leave on time most days, it’s just the occasional day I’m late. And then I get the silent treatment when I’m home. 

My life outside of work has to be so routine to avoid him having anxiety. Even sometimes he just has it anyway. I get home after a 10 hr shift, immediately make dinner, take care of the pets, do some house chores, and we have to be in bed by 9. No reason - he just wants to be in bed by 9. 

Recently I went out to dinner with some family members after work and came home around 9:30. I had communicated for days prior that I would be at dinner and home around 9. He was mad that I came home so late, I interrupted his sleep and made so much noise. 

I very rarely do anything outside of things that are necessary for the house/life. Like the grocery, pet store, Home Depot, doctor. I very rarely meet up with friends or family. I know I’ve pushed many friends away after declining so often. My family visits are always limited to two hours and my husband usually does not join. 

I make him sound terrible but I promise he’s not all that bad. He can be a truly caring person - but things need to be on his terms. 

Today brings me to this post as I sit in the airport. I have been planning a trip with my mom for over a year. Four days. That’s all I’m going to be gone. For weeks he’s been saying he’s cool with me going. I know he isn’t. Then today he told me that I’m being selfish leaving him to care for the house and pets. We have two cats and a dog. It’s not a lot but I am “abandoning him and the family.” I feel everyone deserves a vacation. Including him if he wanted it! His mom agreed to stay at the house if that would make him feel better not being alone.  This weekend he was totally fine, joking, we went to dinner, went to bed late. And starting Sunday he’s been silent. He barely said goodbye to me today. I had to force an I love you before he left for work. He has not made eye contact in days. 

I’m at the end of my rope. But I do feel selfish for complaining when I know he is trying to work on his anxiety. But I am living my life to try and prevent HIS anxiety. I have anxiety about his anxiety. He is so hot and cold. 

He went to a therapist twice back in May. He listens to podcasts about anxiety. But I feel like this is deeper and it’s ruining me as a person. I haven’t been out of town in more than 3 years - I went to a conference for work. It was a similar fight. 

Sorry this is so long. I just started writing and couldn’t stop. 

TL:DR
My husbands anxiety is giving me anxiety. I cannot have a life outside of my home/work without him being anxious and starting a fight.

"UPDATE to how do I (f50) end my 10 yr marriage when I still love him (m50)?

So. He is gone. I told him that I would never choose anyone over my daughter and that he needed to leave. Later, when I texted him that he did something that was unforgivable his response was ""yup I did"". I think he wanted ""out"" and instead of just walking away, which he has done before and I have begged him to come back, he did something so I wouldn't beg him to come back. Later I heard the entire story from my daughter and it was far worse than I thought, but at least she know understands why I asked her if she would ever forgive him. I am very confused right now in that even though I hate him part of me still loves him and part of me still wishes I could fix things. But I know I can't. I feel bad that there is a part of me that still loves him. I know time will heal. But right now this just really really sucks, even with having anger to hold onto.

"My BIL [32M] insulted me [24F] at a wedding. I don’t want a relationship with him at all, and my wife [31F] is caught in the middle.


Hello, r/relationships! I’ve gotten great advice here in the past, so I’m coming to you again with a new issue. Using a throwaway of course. Sorry, this is kind of long. 

My wife is one of six children. I get along with all of her siblings and their SOs well, except for one. My brother in law Eric is just a really rude person. Combative, always needs to be right, very opinionated, but also plays the victim and the “woe is me” card often. Everyone in the family seems to have accepted that this is just how he is, how he’s always been, and is never going to change. However, no one really wants to be around him. I myself avoid him at all costs. 

I think it’s relevant to say that I come from a pretty toxic family dynamic. I’ve cut my dad out of my life completely after some disrespectful things he did. The way I grew up and the things I’ve experienced have made me very intolerant to BS and being mistreated. I don’t have people in my life who make me unhappy. 

Back when my wife and I first started dating, four years ago, she brought me home for thanksgiving to meet her family. I was intimidated and nervous, but excited. Dinner was going well until her brother got drunk and, at the table, pointed at me and said, “you will never be a Doe (their family name)”. I don’t remember the context, but it came out of nowhere. I remember being mortified and not understanding why he would say something like that to me. Everyone kind of shrugged it off and their mom (my now MIL) admonished him and we all moved on with the evening. I never forgot that moment, though, and kept him at arms length since. 

Over the years, Eric has acted pretty awful and immature. Wearing a politically controversial item of clothing at our engagement party (the first time our families met each other). Yelling at his brothers on our wedding day (they were all groomsmen) and carrying around this attitude the entire day, making everything about him. Insulting my family by making racist comments at our wedding. At my bachelorette party, his wife (who I invited) got drunk and cried about how mean he is to her and how he calls her stupid, useless, worthless, etc. Needless to say, our relationship has totally deteriorated and I want nothing to do with him. Which brings me to last night...

We were at my wife’s cousins wedding. Eric and his wife and baby were there. I said a polite hello, but didn’t say another word to him the entire time. When my wife was in a conversation with him, I went to talk to other people. I was being polite and not engaging, because I genuinely have no interest in interacting with him. Everything was fine until dinner. We are all sitting at the same table (me and my wife, Eric, their other siblings, and Mom) and Eric is across from me. At one point, he locks eyes with me and says, “Did you send in your papers?”

I reacted with, “excuse me?” He replied “Your social security papers, to change your name.” (We got married three months ago) I said, “Oh.. no, not yet... we’re traveling soon and I didn’t want to have to get a new passport.”

Before I can finish saying, “passport” he says, “well then I guess you’re really not a Doe.”

I didn’t want to cause a scene at dinner, but I couldn’t hold back the “Are you f***** serious?” that came out of my mouth. I turned to my wife and asked if she was going to say something to her brother. She gave a halfhearted attempt at telling him not to make those kinds of jokes. Eric then launched into calling me a liar, saying the initial incident never happened, and that I made it up. I turned to my wife and asked her if she remembered it happening. Her response was, “I’m not sure.” I left the table and went down to the hotel lobby to get away from him and compose myself. 

My wife came after me, as did my sister in law and mother in law. I couldn’t hold back the tears (I was a little tipsy) and kept asking why he hated me so much. I also told my wife that I didn’t feel like she stuck up for me, and she kept making excuses for her brother, saying “that’s just how he is” and “just ignore him”. We went back to the wedding to toast and dance a bit, and she tried to get him to apologize. He kept calling me a liar and the attempt basically went nowhere. We left shortly after. On the way home, I told her that I don’t ever want to be in a room with him again, and that I didn’t feel like she had my back. She said it wasn’t fair of me to make her choose between home and him (I’m not) and that she did defend me by trying to get him to apologize (he didn’t). I feel really disappointed by the way she reacted to the situation and things between us are tense now. 

Am I in the wrong for not wanting a relationship with him? I know it’s not realistic to NEVER see him again, as we all get together for family vacations and holidays. I just hate interacting with him and can’t bring myself to excuse his behavior. But at the same time, he is my wife’s older brother, and she loves him. I would never try to keep her from her family. I wish I could make her understand how it feels when he treats me like garbage. Reddit, what do I do??

TL;DR my brother in law is a terrible person and i want nothing to do with him. It’s creating a wedge between me and my wife and I feel like she doesn’t have my back. How do I resolve this?

"[Update] Met my (35) Bio-Dad for the first time in my life and am having torn feelings over it.


Thank all of you who replied to my first post. I read them all and appreciate the advice. Original post below for those interested. Sorry for the wall in advance.

Original post - [https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/9h63gs/met\_my\_35\_biodad\_for\_the\_first\_time\_in\_my\_life/](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/9h63gs/met_my_35_biodad_for_the_first_time_in_my_life/)

After my encounter with my bio-dad the only person I told was my wife. I didn't want to bring my mother, great aunt/uncle into this, as I wasn't quite ready to discuss it. I figured next time I spoke with them I would bring it up and it wasn't a ""big-deal"". I  went to work the following day and did see him on site but didn't engage him whatsoever. I knew at some point I would like to speak with him but I just needed time to process everything.

I should mention my mother works in the same building as my bro-dad's sister, my bio-aunt. Which I did meet a few weeks prior to the ""incident"" at a wedding. This was my first meeting of anyone from that side of my family. I should also mention this meeting with my bio-aunt was pleasant, she asked my mother if it would be okay to meet me, which my mother asked me if I would be okay with it and I accepted.  Pictures were taken and hugs exchanged. 

Later that day I did receive a phone call from my mother and she had bought up the encounter. So, my mother knew about the meet and greet by talking with bio-aunt. I guess the meeting got my bio-dad a bit upset as well and he spoke with bio-aunt about it. My mother's stance is very much do what you want, your an adult. In no way throughout my life has she shamed my biological name to me. My mother and I just chatted about the encounter, which was very short one and that was that.

Over the last week or so I did have mix emotions. Like if I should go and speak with him or just avoid him, etc. I thought to myself that I would just take it day by day, until today. I seen him on site and he was alone so I walked up to him. I didn't really have a plan of what to say. I basically said that I didn't appreciate being blindsided like that while at work and that I was sorry for being rude, it is out of character for me and I was raised better than that. He said that he was a little blindsided too which may have lend me to believe he was pushed into the situation by his co-workers (this is something I need to dig into a bit because if it was some prank there will be other discussions).  He basically continued to say that he was sorry for not being in my life and that it was his fault and regretted not being involved. That he was proud of me and that I've grown into a handsome, respectful man and that I have brothers, a sister and nieces/nephews. He did ask if he could talk with me on the phone sometime and maybe meet some of these family members. He said that there wasn't a day that he didn't think about me and that he loves me. He then asked me if he could shake my hand and that was that. I just told him that it as been 35 years and that I just need time with all of this. Maybe in time but it is happening a bit too fast for me.

That is basically it. I'll probably just go about my business with work and at least I feel like I could say hello to him while at work. I am unsure about starting a relationship or connecting right now until I am ready.

TLDR - Talked with him, he apologized for not being around and wants to connect. I told him I'm not ready but will reach out if it happens."
"My [25M] girlfriend [27F] of 15 months didn't tell me about her 4 year-old daughter.


I am an expat in a foreign country. I've been with my girlfriend for 15 months. When I met her she had just moved back to her birthplace (where I live) after living and working on the islands, running a guesthouse. She has been back on the island for a couple of months and is helping her ""business partner"" sell his guesthouse as he will move back to his country next month.  
I found out last week that this business partner is actually the father of her child, whom I had no idea existed. He is the owner of the business and she is there just to help the sale of the business and to take care of their daughter. The child will move with the father to his home country next month as she will begin school, and the country we are in has an extremely poor education system. I confronted my girlfriend about it and she admitted everything and got two flights to come back to where I currently am to talk about it.  
I've asked her why she kept such an important thing for me and she says she was embarrassed. The child was conceived on a one-night stand and they have never been a real couple - staying together for the child until two years ago when they apparently couldn't anymore as they were arguing constantly and it wasn't good for the daughter. I've privately spoken to the father and he has corroborated everything she's told me so I don't believe she has been cheating.  
She has always been a very closed-up person and has severe family issues - she doesn't know who her real father is, and her mother is constantly causing problems (most recently pawning her car without telling her) and asking for money. I knew she had issues with opening up but I just cannot believe she would keep something so serious from me.  
After many long talks this week about it, she's told me she believed I wouldn't want anything to do with her if I knew, and it just got out of control. She felt embarrassed to have an unplanned child with someone who wasn't a partner, and is devastated to be losing her daughter but knows the move is best for her future. I understand omitting this when we met at first, but to keep it for so long is so shocking. I completely trusted her and am very hurt.  
I personally believe she truly is a good person - it seems she's done a great job raising the kid and she was always so kind and generous before all of this. I want to believe that everyone makes mistakes, no one is perfect, and everyone deserves a second chance... I just don't know if the trust can be rebuilt - I've never had a breakup like this.  
*Has anyone heard of a slightly similar situation? Is the relationship salvageable? Or is this unforgivable? I love her very much but I'm not sure what I should do.*
   
  
**TL;DR: My girlfriend didn't tell me about her 4 year-old daughter. The daughter will move to her father's home country next month. She says she didn't tell me out of fear of losing me, and embarrassment of having an accidental child with someone who wasn't even a partner (and very upset about the daughter moving but knows it is best for her education). I want to, but am not sure I can trust her again.**"
"Is the way my spouse takes care of a puppy an accurate foreshadowing for taking care of a child?


My husband and I lost our elderly dog this past summer. I got him when I was 14 (now 31) and and he lived a very happy, lengthy 17 years. We were both devastated when he passed.

Both my husband and I are teachers. After weeks of grieving we decided that the end of summer was an appropriate time to get a puppy, since we both had the time to train him, properly.

We have been talking about having children for about a year and have a loose plan as to when that will happen. When we got the puppy we had both joked that this will be the test for whether or not we are responsible enough to raise children.

We got the puppy, and we are both in love. I'm finding though that I seem to be doing A LOT of the work. I'm the one feeding him, taking him out in the morning, taking him out several times during the day, taking him to the dog park, to the vet, spending hours training him, and was the one who woke up in the middle of the night during crate training.

I often feel like I have to ask my husband for any help and that he won't help on his own. When I do ask its met with resistance and questions like ""do you really think he needs to go out again?"" ""wasn't he JUST out? ""  It's almost easier most days to just do the work myself and not even ask.

Now, I'm growing resentful. Is this what it's going to be like when we have children?  

I've expressed my concerns and frustration, and he's seemed receptive, but here I am again, leaving work to rush home to take care of the dog by myself.  Is this a foreshadowing for what life will be like with kids? 

Tl;dr - feel like I'm doing all the work to raise a puppy alone, and wonder if it'll be the same with children. "
"I [16F] told my brother [28M] to not give me a certain birthday gift last year and now that he didn't give it to me I feel silly and don't know how to apologize.


I kinda feel silly just writing these but whatever...

Since I was 5 till last year my brother would give me a painting of a different flower and other things as a birthday gift. i have them all in my room and I like them a lot, but last year I stupidly told him that they were nerdy and I hated them I wish he had never given me even once

I mean, he would give me a gift which would be something else, but would always give me a painting of a flower.

last year he had to leave for a work trip one day before my birthday and he gave me painting while I was going back home from school. I was just getting home with a few of my friends and he rushed to give me the painting, then hugged and kissed, because he was about to leave. i felt embarrassed that he was kissing me in front of them and when I opened it, my friends said it was a weird and nerdy gift to give someone, one of them said if her boyfriend gave her that as a birthday gift she would break up with him, and i stupdily went along with it

When he got back I told him that it was a nerdy gift and that I had always hated them but had never said anything about it, and that I was too old to receive this silly thing, and gave him back the painting

funny thing is, i don't even see those girls anymore other than a few times in the hallways, so now I'm left with no painting and not even the people that gave the idea, whatever good they might be

so now that my birthday passed and he didn't give me any painting it's like i'm the stupidest person alive, because he was always so sweet about it and I was a total jerk to him.

How can I apologize and ask him to maybe start gifting me the paintings again (if he wants???)?

**tl;dr:** brother used to gift me paintings for my birthday, I stupidly told him to stop last year and now I want them back. How to apologize and ask for them again?"
"My friends betrayed me


Just an hour ago I was at my friend's house along with two other friends (all males btw, including me) and they did something which just devastated me. Here's the backstory: unlike all my friends, I'm a Muslim, I do not drink, do drugs or any of that harmful stuff. Those friends I was with are not Muslim but despite that we always got along, we never discriminate each other or anything like that. They alway respected the fact that I'm a muslim so I don't drink, they never forced me to. Well this time I was with them, and the friend whose house we were in (let's call him friend A, the two others are friend B and friend C) offered everyone a drink, he gave my two friends a beer and I got this drink which looked kinda like beer but he assured me there wasnt any alcohol in it. It was made with cherry or grapes, I can't really remember. I still checked the ingredients but it was very dark and I didnt see the fact that there was alcohol in it. I trusted him and figured he would never lie to me like that. So we started talking and chatting about life, making jokes and all of that. While drinking the bottle I felt this weird sensation in my chest but I didn't really think much of it. After I finished the bottle, friend A looked over to friend B and said :""should we tell him"" and I was like ""what"". He told me there was alcohol in it and pointed to the label where it says ""3.9% alcohol"". I couldn't believe my eyes at first, friend C looked shocked as well and said he didnt know anything about it. I stood up without saying a word and left the house on my bike. There was a gate which I didnt know the code to so I waited and friend A came and opened the door while apologising to which I responded ""I thought we were friends"". I left and friend B and C followed me, they both kept apologising. Friend C kept saying he should've checked the bottle for me and felt guilty for not doing so, I dont blame him, it's not his fault at all. I just pedaled faster and eventually they just left. It was a very lonely ride and felt so so betrayed by them. I just got home and went up to the toilet bowl and made myself vomit by putting my fingers in my throat. I took a shower and faked being happy to my family because I don't want them finding out. I'm in bed right now close to crying. I don't know what to do.
Ps: I apologise if it's not worded correctly, English isnt my native language   

Tl:dr) Friends tricked me into drinking alcohol despite them knowing I'm Muslim"

"I [33F] am trying very hard to lose weight, my partner [36M] keeps trying to feed me. What do?


I've always been at the top end of having a healthy weight, but after having two children in under two years the balance has tipped into the moderately to severely overweight category. I also have high blood pressure, so losing weight is essential for my health. I'm trying very hard to lose weight, but I'm finding it hard to find the proper motivation. I'm lazy as fuck, and my favourite foods almost always involve deep-fried stuff, chocolate, and cheese. Nevertheless I'm trying my best. I'm working with a dietician, I'm counting calories, I'm trying to exercise on a regular basis, but my first impulse is, and remains, to stuff food into my mouth all day, and the medication I'm taking for my blood pressure is making it even harder to lose weight.

&amp;#x200B;

My parter of ten years has always been supportive of me. He's never commented on my weight, he always tells me I look nice, and he's still sexually attracted to me. The only problem is that he keeps trying to feed me. I'm having a hard time saying no already at work, or passing by shops and fast food joints on my way home, and when I'm at home I'd like not to have my guard up. Yet he's constantly plying me with food when we're together and I can't get him to stop doing that. I've plainly asked him not to offer me food. I've explained to him how calories work, and carbs, proteins, fats and so forth. I've gotten mad at him. I've explained how I feel, multiple times, and he seems to listen (he asks questions) and understand. And the next night, the same thing happens again. When I ask him why he keeps doing this, he shrugs and tells me a little bit of food isn't going to kill me, or that he's offering me healthy food (full-fat yoghurt, fruit, nuts) and to his mind, healthy food doesn't make you gain weight. I can't seem to get it out of his head (and neither can the dietician. I've tried).

&amp;#x200B;

I'm not asking him to cut down on his food intake (his weight's fine). I'm not even asking him not to eat snacks near me. All I want is for him to stop offering me things so I can let my guard down.

&amp;#x200B;

Also, before anyone asks: he's defintely not a feeder (if that were the case he'd be encouraging me to gain weight, which he isn't ).

&amp;#x200B;

I realise that I'm lucky to have someone who likes me for who I am and is fine with the way I look, I do, and compared to some of the other issues here this is a trivial thing, but it's bothering me. Any advice?

&amp;#x200B;

I've been with my boyfriend for 8 months and we've had an amazing relationship. It's by far the best relationship I've ever been in. I was married for 10 years before, got divorced, and after dating for a bit I met him and he has changed my life for the better. He's handsome, very intelligent, open with his feelings, and affectionate. We make each other laugh, send each other songs, and write little notes to each other. I truly feel like I want to spend the rest of my life with this amazing man, and I feel so lucky I found him. He's told me the same things, and when I've asked if he's happy he says yes or he'll bring up an issue (I do the same) and we try to resolve it. 

We've had ups and downs of course, but overall we are very much in love and are planning our life together. We also come from a similar background of bad childhoods and have bonded over that, although I think he's better at handling the residual effects from it. (I'm still in therapy for PTSD.)

Which is why I was shocked when last night I came across this list. I was looking for some paperwork when I came across a notebook. Not thinking anything of it, I rifled through and was interested in his notes. (I don't want to say what he does for privacy reasons, but it had to do with the type of work he does which I find fascinating and interesting.) Then a page opened up and I noticed it was a pros and cons list - about me, and our relationship. My stomach dropped and I wanted to just put it back but I couldn't stop reading. I still feel nauseated writing this but I don't know what else to do.

I know it wasn't meant for me to see, and I probably should have just stopped reading it but I couldn't look away. The worst part was seeing the cons list with glaring character flaws and weaknesses that were heartbreaking to read. I don't want to be the person he described. It hurts so much to think that he sees me that way.

I know that for context it's better if I write what was on the list, so I'll write out the condensed version. Under pros he listed beautiful, intelligent, good team together, similar backgrounds, great sex, similar sense of humor, and strong emotional bond. Under cons he listed aggressive, lack of ability to share feelings, uncaring, manipulative, fickle sensitivity, negative bias, self- centeredness, high risk of cheating, afraid to be open.

Some of them I absolutely agree with (I can be aggressive and passionate in an argument, although I try to fight fair. I don't name call or get physical or anything like that. I am also bad at verbalizing my feelings, which therapy is helping me with) and I realize I have things to work on. But some come as a shock - I had no idea he thinks I'm self-centered, or manipulative, or a high risk of cheating. I despise those traits, and having them labeled as me is embarrassing and shameful. I don't want to be that person. And the cheating part kills me - I would NEVER cheat on him. I would rather just break up than put someone through that. I know he has trust issues from being cheated on before, and we've talked about those and he has told me numerous times that he trusts me. 

It got worse after that. The next page was another pros and cons list - for the ""next person."" As in, risk/reward of trying to find someone if this relationship fails. That part hurt the most. I don't want to be a placeholder, I've invested everything I have into this relationship. My entire heart and soul is in this. On that one, under pros it listed warmer, more trustworthy, less aggressive, less age difference, more sincere. And under cons it said not as intelligent, not as beautiful, less sex drive, less successful, less common background. 

I feel like the worst parts are the ones I can't change, like our age difference. And my insecurities are definitely coming into play - I don't want the reason someone wants a relationship with me to be based on attractiveness and sex. Don't get me wrong, those things are super important (to me as well) but I feel I have so much more to offer. I want to be loved for who I am, not how I look.

I'm really trying not to let my emotions get the best of me right now. I'm always open to criticism and changing anything that I can to be a better person. Especially in a relationship! I just don't understand why he would want to be with someone with those awful traits he listed - I know I wouldn't. 

I also know that he probably wrote it to clear his head and get out anything that has been bothering him. I'm really trying to be understanding of where he's coming from. I just wish that I could get my rational side and emotional side to reconcile and be on the same page. I'm just so hurt.

My question is, should I confront him about this? And if so, what do I say? Or should I keep this to myself and use it as a sort of guide to make myself better and keep improving myself? I'm torn on what to do and could really use some advice. Thanks so much if you read this whole thing."
"My (17M) boyfriend is suffocating me with his perpetual need to be in some form of contact with me (17M)


To preface this my boyfriend and I have been together for 2 years now. He confessed to me unsure of whether I'd reciprocate and after thinking about it for a summer I decided to give him a chance and we've been together since. 


Our relationship is nice most of the time but multiple times a week it gets to the point where I just want him to stop talking to me and leave me be, or he's crying because I'm asking him to let me go home or something. He has depression, anxiety, and OCD so I try to be accommodating because while I can't relate to what he's feeling all the time I want to avoid being another cause of stress for him but it doesn't ever seem to be enough. For example, we will be working on homework and he'll stop and look at the ceiling so I'll ask ""Are you okay?"" and sometimes he'll respond saying ""Yeah, I just need a minute"" and other times he'll ignore me. Recently he's been telling me asking him questions when he's like that stresses him more. Simply asking if he's alright, something you'd think would be taken as a sign of concern, causes him to be stressed. So I've been trying to stop asking him questions when's he like that but now it seems even asking him ""What are you doing on this day?"" Or anything else that occurs in casual conversation stresses him. I can't really talk to him with stepping on eggshells so I'm at a loss on what to do. 


Getting on to the very attached part, he always wants to be touching me. I don't mean in a sexual way, he almost never wants to do things like that, and I feel petty saying this but his lack of sexual interest furthers my growing discontent towards the relationship. He seemingly wants us to be attached at the hip. At school he wants to he wrapped around my arm all the time, or leaning at me, or holding my hand. At his place he always wants me to hug him, and hold his hand, and not leave the room he's in. It all feels so suffocating. I can't talk to him about how I feel because he'll start crying and say I hate him, and I can't tell him I don't always want to be connected to him because sometimes I wanna move around by myself and it gets uncomfortable because he'll just start crying and saying things like ""Oh, he hates me. I knew it."" Even when we're not together we're in near constant contact with one another beach we text each other endlessly. I just feel so trapped like I can't get a moment of me time because whenever I have some he's texting me saying ""Im sad"" and ""I miss you"" like a broken record, and like everything else nothing I say helps him get better. 


With college applications coming soon too I haven't had anytime to work on essays because he's been consuming all my free time, and as I said earlier he gets very upset when I confront him about almost anything, so I can't find the time to really work on college essays. He's planning to go to a local college so for him college application season doesn't really matter but I'm applying out of state and whatnot so I sort of need my time to get my ducks in a row but he just keeps being a roadblock to progress. There's just so many different ways he's limiting me, and so many ways he's limiting me trying to help him with his problems. I know he doesn't really mean to and he can't entirely control it but what am I supposed to do? 


Tl;dr: I feel smothered by my boyfriend, I can't talk to him about it. What do?"
"Is it reasonable for my parents to expect me (24F) and my boyfriend (24M) to sleep separately?


I currently live with my boyfriend in a place fully funded by us. My conservative-ish parents know this and are fine with it. They implied before that they expect us to sleep in separate rooms when we sleep over at theirs which I respect because it's their place and their rules. However my mom said that she would expect us to sleep separately when they come over to visit as well. I believe that this is too much because you can't impose rules like that when you are coming over to someone's house. They come here knowing we live together so it is unfair of them to expect us to amend our living arrangements for them. They did pay for my education and accommodation abroad the past 4 years but I am employed and living on my salary now.

TL;DR: Are my parents being reasonable when they expect their grown up daughter to sleep on a couch when visiting her place where she lives with her boyfriend?"
"My (24F) friend (24F) cancelled my plans to move in with her the day before I was meant to move and I don't know what this means for our friendship going forward.


Hey reddit, I have a shitty situation that's unfolded this morning. Sorry if this turns out a bit long.

I had plans to move in with a friend this weekend (she's already renting a place with a spare bedroom and I was being added to the lease). Basically, she called me this morning and told me she had something serious to talk to me about. She said she's been increasingly anxious about me moving in over the last couple of weeks and only sorted out her feelings yesterday when she talked about it with another friend.

In short, she said she's not ready to live with someone and that she needs to maintain her safe space and look after her mental health. She said we can talk about it again in future once she's in a more stable place. She's struggled with depression over the last couple of months and we've been talking a lot more as we've supported each other through that (I have bipolar disorder that I've steadily been trying to manage since my diagnosis) so I knew she'd been having a hard time.

The thing is I absolutely understand having crappy mental health and needing space and being anxious about things. I asked her why she didn't tell me sooner and she said she didn't know how she felt until she talked to her friend about it and it just isn’t a good enough excuse. She literally could have just said that she was confused and didn't how she felt and I would have made other plans or put it off. She let me message her all week talking about plans and saying how excited I was and gave no indication she was having second thoughts now I just feel like a complete idiot and like my life’s been turned upside down. Her mental health isn’t the only one that matters. Other people have feelings to consider and leaving it until the literal day before I’m meant to move in just feels like a complete disregard for that and makes me feel like she doesn't actually care about me at all.

I barely remember what I said during the phone call because I was in shock. She said she understands if I need time and that she understands I'm angry at her and she sounded apologetic but it just isn't good enough.

I'm just so confused. The entire process of me moving in was suggested by her when I mentioned another friend had asked me to look for a place with her and some other friends (who have now rented somewhere else with no spare bedroom so moving with them is no longer an option). I was really excited by it and agreed because we get along well and have similar living habits and it seemed like a really good option. Now that's down the drain.

When we were initially discussing move in dates I asked her over and over if this weekend was too soon, if she needed more time, and I was totally okay with that but she reassured me over and over that she was fine with it and it would be an exciting change. So I've now spent money on a trailer to move that's non-refundable, my entire life is completely packed away and I was excited and ready to go and now it just feels like my life has been put on hold.

I've been living with my parents for the past few months saving money (I live in Sydney and rent is expensive) so I can still stay with them while I look for another place thankfully but they're out in the suburbs an hour from the centre of the city. It's been really hard being isolated and I was excited to be close to the city and my friends again.

I just don't know what else I could have done to have avoided this. I feel like my trust in her is completely broken and I'm really upset and angry and feel rejected.

We've been friends for going on 10 years I just never thought someone I consider a best friend would do this to me. I'm absolutely not going to consider moving in with her in future if she magically decides she's ready, I'm so angry I feel like I never want to speak to her again at this point.

I know it's still fresh and I need time to process and I might feel differently with some time and space but I'm devastated. Do you think an action like this is something a friendship can come back from? Am I being too harsh in wanting to cut contact?

\*\*TL;DR;\*\* My friend told me she's not ready for me to move in the day before I was meant to move in with her. I want to cut contact and am wondering if I'm being too dramatic. Some advice would be appreciated."
"My [29F] boyfriend [32M] just bought a house and our neighbor [63M] is already making our life hell.


For starters, it's been a nightmare trying to find a house that requires us to live within our means. We live in the Cleveland area and were priced out of the suburbs. So after finding an adorable 3 bedroom updated ranch with a finished basement, pool, and completely fenced in yard for $106,000 in a safe area in the city limits, we snatched it up. In the back of my mind I kept thinking ""What's wrong with it?""

Welp.

Sunday when we got the keys, we went over. As soon as we got out of the car the neighbor busts out of his house and calls us over. I literally hate people, but my boyfriend is very extroverted so he decided let's run over and meet the new neighbors. Enter ""Fred.""

Fred is dirty and disheveled. Everything in his yard is a mess. There's stuff piled up in the house. He can't stay on one topic. He immediately starts talking about how our neighbors next door had a crazy party last night that ""lasted until 9:00pm!"" He said he calls 911 a lot. He said there's drug dealers everywhere. What a way to be welcomed to the neighborhood....anyway after entertaining him for a few minutes I dragged my boyfriend back across the street.

While we were in the kitchen, I looked out the window facing Fred's house. He's sitting on his porch, staring directly into the window. I do not mess around with anything like this. My home is my sanctuary, I like my privacy, and I'm nipping this in the bud. So I made eye contact and shut the curtains.

While we're out there looking at the pool, etc. he's yelling at us from across the street. We've taken to ignoring him, and it seemed to work.

We went and talked to our other next door neighbor and she said to stay away from Fred. He's a hoarder, he stole her dog (!!!!!!!), he calls 911 for every little thing, sits on the porch all day and just watches everyone. I asked her if he'll invite himself over or just come over unannounced.....she said, ""No, I don't think he'll go that far.""

Well, cut to last night, and we're bringing more boxes over. Boyfriend gets out of the car to unlock the gate to get into the driveway (I now see why the previous owners have an entire fenced in yard.) Before he can even get out of the car, Fred is running across the street into the driveway screaming something about a dog and he called animal control. The car is still running, we're obviously trying to get situated....I finally get out of my car and go up to him and say, ""Fred, if you'll excuse us, we have a lot of work to do."" Trying to set boundaries, be polite yet firm. He stares at me for a minute and then leaves.

As we're getting stuff out of the cars, he's yelling across the street at us. We ignore him. We leave last night. He's still outside trying to talk to us. We ignore him.

Today my boyfriend sent me the parcel number on the house from the county website. Using that, I found Fred's house and first and last name. A quick google search showed a news article about a two year trash battle. His yard legitimately looked like the hoarders on TLC....just piles and piles of trash everywhere, all over his yard. There's a photo of him being interviewed in his car and it's nasty. Food stains, trash piled up....I'm sickened at this point. I watch the news video and he said it's payback because none of the neighbors helped him when his house got broken into. The trash was festering for TWO YEARS before the city stepped in and almost condemned him. He cleaned it up.

An additional google search showed a mugshot for telephone harassment.

So now I'm freaking out. I usually hate confrontation but I just want to nip this in the bud. I'm also not ruling out getting a restraining order if it comes to that, but I'd like it not to. Also, since he stole the neighbors dog, my idea for a cat door so my precious cats can enjoy the yard is shot. What should we say to him to ensure he stays away from us?

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR: Neighbor across the street is a hoarder, stole our next door neighbors dog, calls 911 a lot, and got arrested for harassment. What can we say/do to ensure he stays away from us?"
"I am[22f] and I can’t support my sister[21f] anymore and I don’t know how to tell her


My sister is in a shitty abusive relationship. He[29m] has hit her before, he doesn’t let her have a life, he doesn’t buy her basic necessities like tampons and stuff even tho he actually has a lot of money. Like, he’s set. Me on the other hand, I don’t have a lot of money but yet I’m supporting her and my niece and nephew. I buy her personal items, diapers, food, etc. I just can’t afford it anymore. I’m doing without to make sure she has what she needs and I can’t keep doing this to myself. I have a life and a family too. I just wanna choke her(not literally) some times, it just makes me so mad she’s still with him. I can no longer feel sorry for her anymore. It’s her choice to stay there. She isn’t stuck. She could stay with me, her grandma, etc. she has a choice. I understand she doesn’t want to do that, but I’ve done all I can here. I’m fed up. She calls me at 2am to come get her(she stays 20 minutes away) as she’s walking down the road with my niece and nephew just for her to start crying and begging me to turn around once we get half way to my house and if I don’t, she will try to walk back. She’s mentally unstable and she doesn’t need to be like that around her children. I just can’t do this anymore. I don’t want her to feel alone and get suicidal again. But there come as a time where I have to put my family(my husband and son) first. Am I wrong? I don’t wanna drop her out of my life, I have no problem helping her, but at this point I feel like I’m condoning it and allowing it to happen like this. As long as I’m taking care of her, he’s gonna think he doesn’t have to and she isn’t gonna put her foot down. I’ve tried talking with him, he denies that he hits her and says he doesn’t buy the stuff because she doesn’t tell him she needs it. I’ve seen the bruises and I’ve seen how he acts towards her.. but could there be some truth in what he’s saying there? Maybe, maybe not. I plan on going over there today and sitting her down and explaining I can’t afford to do this anymore and that she doesn’t need to call me that late to come get her unless she actually wants to stay. Even if it’s just for the night. I don’t want her to feel like I’m giving up on her, but honestly I need to change something I can’t keep doing this. Part of me wants custody of my niece and nephew but the other part knows I can’t handle it. I have my own child to care for. I don’t think I could handle two more kids. Both younger than mine. I know I can afford it obviously because I’m already financially supporting them, but should I have to put that on myself? Being that I KNOW it’s more than I can handle? What would you do? Please don’t tell me how stupid and gullible I am, because Jesus fuck do I already know, lol.

Tl;dr I’m tired of supporting my sister. I can’t afford it. It’s becoming too much. And she’s not trying to better her self of situation. "
"How do I handle a male (50M) family member being inappropriate towards me (22F)?


*Tl;dr: my uncle (dad’s younger sister’s husband) is being inappropriate towards me and I don’t know what to do without causing huge tension in my family. 

My uncle (50M) on my dad’s side of the family about a year and a half ago started to message me (22F) on instagram. It was totally innocent at the time, just asking me how I was doing and catching up. It’s my dad’s younger sister’s husband so we’re not related by blood. It progressively got to the point where he was making me uncomfortable, telling me how good I looked and that I needed to keep posting pictures of myself because “I’m too good looking not to share.” He recently has gotten more bold, and one time basically implied that I should send him nude pictures and tried to video chat me at 1am on instagram. He doesn’t act this way towards me in person because people have always been around, but I’m afraid if given the chance he would do something inappropriate in person. I don’t know what to do, because I’m afraid if I’ll block him it’ll cause drama/cause him to be this way to me in person  since instagram is our only line of communication. I’m afraid if I cut that off he’ll have no choice but to act this way towards me I person. 

I’m also afraid that if I tell my dad his solution will just be to sweep it under the rug to avoid drama and just don’t go around him or his family anymore, which is upsetting because I still want to see my cousins and aunts, and I also don’t want drama and it’ll stir up drama if we randomly stop coming around anymore. 

I also don’t wanna tell my aunt, his wife, because I’m afraid she’ll either 1) not believe me, or 2) resent me for this even tho it’s totally not my fault, I’ve never answered/indulged his advances/strung him along. I just have no idea what to do. My sisters know, my sister’s husband knows, and they make sure that when we’re around him at family events that he stays away from me, which is starting to make my aunt catch on to something being wrong since I never go around her husband anymore and avoid him. What can I do that won’t hurt my family? "
"My [24F] boyfriend [26M] won a lot of money, wants to help his ex


My boyfriend won a lot of money in our country's lottery. We've been together for 2 years. When he first told me, after the excitement had settled, I realized this was his money. And wondered if he was going to leave me. He made it very clear he has no intention of leaving me, and that this changes nothing between us. 

He first wants to focus on helping friends and family, and then being smart with the money, and not drastically changing our lives in any way. I totally agree and respect this. We were talking about people he wanted to help out, and he brought up his ex girlfriend that he dated from 17 to 22. He says he only wants to pay off her student loans, and doesn't plan to rekindle any sort of communications with her. She was there at a weird time in his life, low self-esteem, teenage stuff. And that she was the first person to ever really love him. They ended mutually due to job offers in different cities. I am fine with him paying off her student loans, but can't help feel a little uneasy in the feelings it could potentially bring up. He obviously still cares for her, and possibly loves her. And I would obviously never try to convince him not to pay off her student loans. It just feels like if he does, they're going to reconnect and I'm going to lose him. 

He's the most caring, funny and sexiest man I know. I was completely in love with him, and fully intended on spending the rest of my life with him, before he came into this money. He could give it all away, and my feelings for him wouldn't change at all. **I don't want anyone to think I'm scared of losing the money more than losing him.**

**TL;DR** Boyfriend came into a lot of money, wants to help his ex out financially, I'm scared it will rekindle their love."
"My roommate [27f] and I [24f] have different views on sex and relationships. She does not want my boyfriend [23m] to sleep over at our house.


My roommate ""Georgia"" and I lived together with another girl until early this year and decided to move into a new place together. We are both practicing Catholics, though her faith tends to define her life while my faith is a ""part"" of my life. We are very close friends with a healthy, communicative relationship. Neither of us are passive-aggressive roommates, we do what needs to be done around the house without complaint and without expectation of reciprocation. I feel comfortable talking to her about anything, and she with me, and we've been there for each other through a lot in the past! I really really value her as person, friend, and mentor.

Anyway, I started dating someone new right before we moved into our new house. One of the first nights I stayed at his house was literally days before we moved, and when she questioned where I'd been the night before when I got home, I told her. We are very honest with each other. She didn't judge me for it or anything, though I know for a fact that she doesn't do that kind of thing with her boyfriend because of her faith. That's just her belief and she's totally entitled to it.

The first weekend in our new place, she sat me down and told me that she really liked my boyfriend (they met and get along great) and was very happy for me, but she wasn't going to be comfortable with him staying the night at our place. Initially, I told her that was all well and good-- I didn't want to do anything to make her uncomfortable. She goes out of town for work a lot, and I asked if maybe it would be okay to have him over the weekends she's out of town. She told me that wouldn't be okay either, because she wouldn't want it to ""become a habit,"" which I still don't fully understand. She also said that she doesn't want me having him stay the night because she ""wants to do that with her boyfriend, too"" but won't because of her beliefs...? Also not sure what that means. I left it alone because I didn't want to make anything weird between us. But I thought about it more and more and ended up bringing it up to her again a few days later. This was only about my boyfriend staying over the weekends she was gone. She went into this big long monologue about what relationships truly mean, how she'd shared beds with men outside of marriage before and it messed things up in her head, what marriage really is to God, how we live our dating lives contributes to our spirituality, and so on. She went on to say that yeah, I could have him over the weekends she's out of town and ""what she doesn't know won't kill her,"" but I promised to have an honest roommate relationship with my close friend! I would never want to go behind her back.

I know Georgia. She is not a judgmental or self-righteous Catholic. She is an accepting and truly good person. She's made mistakes and does not view herself as an elite to me. She even told me, “I don’t think you’re a sinner for sharing a bed with your boyfriend.” But I can't help but feel like she's making silly excuses with this issue and ultimately making it more about HER. It's not like my boyfriend and I would be having loud obnoxious sex or doing anything at all to hurt or bother her, ESPECIALLY on the weekends she's gone. I spend so many nights at my boyfriend's house, which is fine and thank God his three roommates aren’t tired of me yet, but I want to share my space with him, too! I want him to know how I live in my space just as I’ve learned how he lives in his. Not to mention my house is a little calmer than his (note the three roommates I mentioned before) and would be a really nice place for us to sleep in on the weekends. 

I also know very well that I’m a grown ass woman and I pay my own rent and I can have my boyfriend stay the night in my room... at the expense of straining my very good relationship with my roommate and friend. 

I’m getting more and more frustrated with this. I want to talk to Georgia but I’m not sure how to get her to actually talk about this rather than go on some spiritual rant. 

TL;DR My roommate is telling me she would be uncomfortable with my boyfriend staying the night at our house because it’s against her beliefs, even on weekends she’s out of town for work. I know I need to talk to her about it especially since I don’t understand a lot of what she’s said her reasoning is. How can I bring this up to her without straining our healthy relationship? "
"Boyfriend (23M) became very upset with me (25F) when I went to a bonfire of a friend who invited him and asked him if he had weed.


My boyfriend and I have been dating for just over a year.  We have had some issues in the past relating to me wanting more alone time and independence in the relationship. For example, I don’t like spending every night at his house and like to have 2-3 nights at my own place during the week, just for some “me” time and creative pursuits.  I’ve told him several times that this doesn’t mean I don’t love him, but spending several days with one person can be draining.

This past week had been stressful for me because I was studying for the GRE. I gave up several planned social engagements because I decided studying should have my full attention.  After I finished my test yesterday, I saw that a friend had invited me and my boyfriend to her bonfire she was having that afternoon. It was early enough in the evening that I would be able to go and still make my roommate’s EP release show, which I had promised a month in advance to go to, and which my boyfriend knew about. I was really excited to get back into my social routine after being a shut-in for several weeks.

I texted him and he informed me that this friend had invited him in a separate message. I met him at the bar he works at, intending for both of us to drive over when his shift had ended. Here’s where the problems start. His manager was keeping him a lot longer than expected, and it was likely that he wouldn’t be getting off work in time. I told him that I would still like to go to the bonfire since several of my friends would be there and that he and I could meet up at the show later and then have a bottle of wine after it was over.

He said that he was tired after being on his feet all day and that he wanted us to just go to his place afterwards. I said that I was very sorry that he was tired, but that he didn’t have to come if he didn’t want to, and offered to head back to his place after hanging out at the show for an hour (even though I wanted to stay for the entirety).  He then said he was very uncomfortable with the text message that the host of the bonfire had sent him. He showed me the text,  which said “Hey ___, I’m having a little get together at my place with a bonfire, just a small gathering with a few friends, and I would love it if you and anonanontoolong could join. Also if happen to have any “flowers,” I’d love to get some.”

She had bought weed from him in the past but we had also hung out as a group of mutual friends before as well. This friend is even joining us on a group camping trip, which my boyfriend initially seemed happy with. 

He then proceeded to tell me that he didn’t want me to go to the bonfire because he thought that this friend was using him for weed, and that I should not want such a person as a friend. I was shocked that he would say this and never saw anything malicious in her message.  From my interpretation, she wanted to invite both of us and restock as well. Once again, he had sold to her in the past and had never expressed any issue in doing so. I went to the bonfire anyway, stayed for 20 minutes, and then drove 2 friends to the show. My BF called me almost as soon as I got there and spent 15 minutes yelling over the phone that I don’t care about his feelings. Then he begged for me to drive over to his place and demanded for me to stay on the phone until I got in the car.  I left my friends and the show I’d just paid for extremely early because he was emotionally distraught that I’d gone to the bonfire.

I’m still angry about the situation. I feel that he was primarily upset that I didn’t want to do what *he* wanted to do, and I personally saw nothing wrong with this friend’s text, and know for a fact that she really enjoys his company.

TLDR: My boyfriend thinks that a friend was using him for weed after she invited both of us to a bonfire. He is angry that I went to the bonfire regardless. I think the argument that ensued was ridiculous."
"Husband (29m) of 9 years just told me (28f) that he'd rather go on his ski trip by himself to ""get a break"" from me and infant (8 mos) I'm really hurt by this.


So to start with I love my husband and I know for a fact he loves me. I'm 8 months PP and a stay at home mom which I love and has been my life's dream. I did have a miserable pregnancy and really leaned on my husband a lot for emotional, physical and medical support. My husband is currently in his residency after four very hard years of medical school and this coming ski trip was literally going to be our first vacation since we were undergrads. 


I was so looking forward to going but last night he sat me down and very calmly told me that he needs ""a break"" and would really like to go on the trip by himself. He's willing to do all the work to fly his mom in so she can stay with me and he's even willing to set up a solo vacation for me. I don't want this. I want to be with him and our new  little family. I don't care if he skis by himself and I stay with our son but I think a chance of scenery together would be really good for us. I started crying and while he was sympathetic he said that this is the exact reason he needs a break and come back rejuvenated to be a supporting husand again.


Now that I've laid this all out there, what can I do to get him to change his mind?

Tl;dr: husband told me he wants to go on vacation by himself instead of with me and infant. I'm crushed over this."
"Me [26F] and him [24M], 6 months. Is he abusive? How do I make it stop?


Wall of text incoming.

I don't even know where to start.
My boyfriend and I have been dating for about 6 months now, and for the first couple of weeks it was great. In hindsight it was probably going way too fast not to raise red flags, but well. We talked all the time, met every other and then everyday. We where friends before that for a couple of months. I'm just going to list the two incidents that, added up, make me feel extremely weird now:

- he talked about marriage after two months. At the time I didn't really take that seriously...? I mean, who would? The conversations seemed kinda light-hearted and in a joking manner. If anything, to me, it was more of an ""in general I'm not averse to marriage"" thing, not an ""I want to marry you in the foreseeable future"".
He handed me the documents needed to get married a couple days after and told me we could get an appointment now. I was taken aback and we had a huge blowout, where I made my point that no reasonable person could've taken anything we talked about as a legit plan to get fucking married right then.
We talked it out. I chalked it up to a miscommunication. 

- my roommate is my (male) best friend of 12 years, and we've been sharing an appartment für about 4 years now. My boyfriend was aware of this beforehand. He's met him. He started pushing to move in together after three months or so, and I told him that no way would I move in with someone I'd been dating for a couple of months. He started getting unreasonably jealous.

Exhibit A, our current spat: I contracted the measles (fuck knows how). I was pretty much bed-ridden for three weeks and, as common sense dictates, I did not want visitors, what with having an extremely contagious disease. I mostly quarantined myself in my room.

He was pissed that I only texted him once or twice a day and didn't keep up conversations. I told him that I physically couldn't spend that much time on my phone and that I needed rest. Yesterday he told me he had a nightmare about me and my roommate having sex. At this point, I was fed up with having to deal with his insecurity.    He's fishing for compliments all the time, putting himself down and expects me to tell him the opposite and gets unreasonably angry when I tell him I'm not a replacement for his self-esteem or here to validate him every damn day.

So I told him ""okay, what do you want me to say? I'm not responsible for your dreams"". He blew up at me. Told me I could've said that of course that wouldn't happen because I only loved him, and why couldn't I just do that instead of making everything difficult.
Then he kinda went off about how he hadn't seen me in almost a month (I'm still at home, what with the measles) and I spent the whole month with my roommate instead of him, so his fears where of course valid.

It didn't matter that I spent that month holed up in my room and not with anyone. He went all ""yeah, I'm a piece of shit not worth talking to, I know"".
I told him that I'm tired of hashing this bullshit out again and I won't discuss this anymore period.
So he told me maybe he should have a word with my roommate, quote: man to man, to ""solve"" this problem. No idea what that had to do with his fucking insecurity, but apparently according to him that was the source of our problem.

At this point, I was not only physically exhausted, tired, and sick, but really fucking done. I told him that I'm done with this stupid manipulative shit and I can't keep him from doing anything, but actions have consequences and I'm not letting anyone guilt or threaten me into anything. He back-pedaled. Went ""it was just a joke"". I told him not to insult my intelligence and I was done talking tonight.



Thing is, I seem to have some self-esteem issues of my own. Why do I let him do this crap and come back for more? Why do I chalk things up to ""it's just a one time thing""? Usually, I end up thinking I must've done *something* to make him do this or that, and only when I write it out like this it seems clear to me that's ridiculous. But I doubt my own reasoning by now. He keeps throwing things I said in a fight weeks ago in my face and keeps twisting my words to a degree I don't even know what I actually said anymore. How do I make this stop? I'm at a point where I just want him to vanish, but the idea of breaking up makes me weirdly anxious, especially how he might react.

TL;DR: boyfriend is overly jealous and has low self-esteem, drives me insane. What do I do?

"BFF WANTS HER BF TO CUT AGAIN


Okay so my best friend (f19) is very insecure and she went through her boyrfriend's (m22) phone and saw that he had looked up cosplay pictures of other girls. She got really angry at him and told him shes going to leave him and that hes disgusting and made him cry because he did this. Anyway we were hanging out and she told me shes so insecure so she doesnt know why he would do this and I was just being a good friend like ""yeah that sucks"" sorta shit.

Anyway that was alright until she started saying stuff like ""I want to make him feel as bad as he did when he used to cut himself"" and like he used to be really depressed and it was so bad (we were all friends before they started dating) She just kept going on about how bad she wants to make him feel and how lucky he is to even be with her. I felt so disturbed by her saying this stuff because I have suffered from bad depression and so has she so I dont know why she would ever wish for anyone to suffer that again, LET ALONE HER FUKN BOYFRIEND.

Im sorry if this doesnt really make sense i dont really use reddit but I just cant tell anyone irl this because everyone likes her and i dont want people to think differently of her. But its Just so disgusting that she would say that about someone she loves and idk what to do like should I stop talking to her??? (shes also really mean to me aswell, basically treats me like im dumb as shit especially in front of other people) And she always sorta slut shames me too or will say i look like a stripper n just really rude shit like that???? sorry if this post sucks i just dont kno wht to do

&amp;#x200B;

tdlr: bff wants her bf to feel like real shit n even wants him to cut himself bc he looked at cosplay pics. "
"I [F19] ghosted a boy [F18] a year ago because he made me feel uncomfortable. One year later and he still hasn’t gave up sending me messages, even when I have never responded. It’s starting to become of concern.


I want to begin by saying I know ghosting is wrong and that it would have probably been a better to decision to explain to him why I didn’t want to keep in contact anymore. However, I also want to add that I want to take no blame for this situation, and that I’m fully aware his mental health is none of my concern. I also have doubt that a proper explanation would have stopped him. The hint has been made *very* clear, and over one year later, he has showed no desire to move on.

This was an online friendship. We both had social media profiles (think of Tumblr blogs, though it wasn’t Tumblr) that had no connection to our identities. We posted often about things that we liked and shared them with communities that had the same interests. This is how we met, and when he reached out to me. I kept my privacy so that he even had assumed I was a boy until we had started to really get to know each other. We talked about school, daily activities, interests, goals, and our personal lives. I would rant and he would listen, he would tell me about his struggles with depression and mood swings and I would listen. Then he developed a crush on me and wanted to meet me. I liked him at the time and said that we could meet, so I told him my location. All the information he has on me is this (general city) and my first name.

He became increasingly obsessed and it made me uncomfortable. I would wake up to paragraph long messages about how beautiful I was and how much he liked me, even though we were never an exclusive “couple.” I would thank him and move on, but the messages just got longer and more frequently sent. I never sent him any sort of message back, even though he strongly hinted he would like me to, insisting that I try to express myself better for him. This is when I started to want to talk less frequently than usual, so I told him now that I began college, I would no longer run my social media profile and would be able to talk to him much less often. He agreed, and a few days went by without hearing from him, and I felt relieved. I believe he texted me again and I responded thinking that since he gave it a few days we would be okay, but no. He just told me how much me missed me and wrote me another long paragraph message. At this point, I ghosted him. I didn’t want to be involved anymore and really wanted to focus on my studies, so I ghosted him. For months and months he was saying “my name?” “Hello?” over and over again, several times a day. I never gave in. 

I revisited our social media profiles and while mine hasn’t been active in over a year, his posts consist of him counting down the days since he last spoke to me. The last was posted 11 hours ago, just the number 385. I can also see when he’s last visited my profile, and even though I haven’t posted in that amount of time, he still checks it on a daily basis.

What can be done about the situation?

TL;DR: Ghosted a young man I met online because he became infatuated with me and I wasn’t interested, and I believed he would move on. 385 days later with no response from me, the messaging is still constant. "
"I'm (29F) turning 30 in November. My husband (30M) doesn't want to spend any money on me for my 30th despite the fact we did a ton of things for his birthday.


He went skydiving, did a 5k, bought some athletic expensive headphones, goes rock climbing a few times a month, did another thing (Questival), and he told me today we are too broke for me to get my $300 tattoo for my 30th birthday.

He makes a lot more money than I do, but I pay my fair share for everything.  He told me last month he was going to do this for me for my birthday.  Now it's just too much, and I'm really disappointed.  I don't know how to talk to him about it without making him defensive.  He spends so much money on himself and never does anything for me... This I'd just the straw I guess.

He also doesn't think we can do anything for our 3rd anniversary in October, despite the fact I'm down to just get a babysitter (family, so free) and make a nice meal and turn our phones off and be intimate.  I feel really unappreciated and neglected.

Tl;Dr, my husband spends tons of money on himself and just told me we couldn't do my thing for my 30th birthday because we were too broke.  I want to know how to talk to him about how disappointed I am."
"My [30F] boyfriend [31M] is a psychopath. What now?


Last night my boyfriend told me his therapist diagnosed him as having psychopathic tendencies. I had no idea what to say and don’t know what to ask him or what to do.

I didn’t even know what a psychopath is so I looked it up and a lot of the traits sound like him. Especially the lying and manipulating.

He’s never been abusive or anything to me, but I’ve always felt like he’s emotionally closed off and enjoys fucking with me to get me upset, then doing some grand gesture to “fix” it then starting the whole thing over again. I’m constantly on eggshells trying not to upset him, then constantly wondering if he’s actually upset with me or just enjoys pretending to be upset so he can get a reaction out of me.

He doesn’t have many friends, just a lot of acquaintances...

Him being a psychopath explains a lot.

What do I do now? Will his psychologist recommend him to a psychiatrist who will prescribe medication? Will just seeing a therapist help? Is trying to stay with him going to be a losing battle?

Anyone’s experiences would be helpful. I’m so lost.

Our relationship is already fragile and I just don’t know what to do with this new information.

TLDR: Boyfriend was diagnosed as having psychopathic tendencies. What does being in a relationship with a psychopath mean for my future?"
"My [25f] mother [66f] said she doesn't want anything for her birthday, so I donated to a charity in her name. Now she seems mad?


Basically the title. I asked my mother if she wants something specific for her birthday that was a few days ago. She said that she knows money is tight and besides I bought her some kitchen utensils for no occasion a few weeks ago, so she doesn't want anything. I, apparently foolishly, took her seriously, but since me and my SO had some money put away for her birthday (not a lot, but enough for a book or some clothes) we decided to donate it to a charity that supports shelters in her name.

Now, we visited my mother for her birthday, wished her many happy returns and told her, that since she didn't want anything we donated a bit of money to shelter animals. I though she was going to be happy, because she loves animals and herself helps a local shelter sometimes - buys food, brings blankets, etc., but she started acting very cold, thanked us politely, but it seemed very tense and for the end of the day she treated us almost like air.

Should I give her a call and apologize? Maybe try to buy her some trinket anyway? Or should I drop it as she seems unreasonable?

\*\*tl;dr my mother didn't want a birthday gift, so I donated money I saved for it to charity in her name and for some reason she got mad. Should I do anything about it?\*\*"
"I [22/F] need help having a healthy argument with my boyfriend [30/M]


We’ve been together 2 years, living for 1. 

Once a week we have a huge fight over something stupid.

For example: He has a big interview this morning so we went to bed early. I had trouble sleeping last night and accidentally woke him up “20 times”. He complains to me multiple times this morning that I woke him up in a rude tone. He doesn’t like it when I say sorry (“because sorry means nothing”?) so I told him I had bad dreams last night and went to bed too early and that I didn’t mean to do it. He says “NO!” it’s because I had too many covers on and sweating woke me up. He then calls me screaming on the phone on the way to work/interview saying how it will be all my fault if he blows this interview. Then he hangs up on me. He is absolutely furious. 

Here’s how it goes: he complains to me about a problem he has about me, but instead of saying it in a calm way, he’s very blunt, direct, and to be honest quite mean about it. He then repeats himself over and over and over again to make sure I get the point and don’t do it again. Then he says I have an attitude when I try to respond even though I’m being very calm. I’ve expressed this to him but he says that’s the way he is, will always be, and I have to grow up and get over it. I understand that, but I get extremely heated when he tells me over and over again like I don’t understand the first time. How do I overcome this? I hate fighting every week over something dumb like this. Am I just too young for him? Too sensitive? I have no idea how to fix fights with him. It’s not just this fight, but every one. I always end up being the submissive. 

TL;DR: we fight once a week over something small and stupid. When we do, he complains to me nonstop until I “get it” which makes me even more mad, making him mad to the point of slamming doors and yelling in my face. It’s like I can never win. "
"Is My BF (22M)'s Flirty ""One That Got Away"" (22F) A Problem?


 

My boyfriend (let’s call him Danny) (22M) and me (22F) have been good friends for years and been dating for about 1 1/2. I can tell that he really likes me, we have a very rare bond, can’t go a few hours without talking  and share the exact same sense of humour. We go on big trips, he invites me on double dates with his friends, talks to his mom about me, I have no reason to doubt his feelings for me, but one thing I can't stop thinking about. Danny has this friend (“Jane”). Jane is drop-dead gorgeous. Confident, funny, and everyone in school wants to be with her. I am attractive, but Jane is more attractive. Danny and Jane were in the same university program and they were close friends. She’s also been flirting with him for on and off years and I know from a friend that Danny has had feelings for her. Before Danny and I got serious, she was leading him on again while I was away (went to a different university and we had a long distance fling, so no problem if he was seeing someone else back then), but they went on a few “hangouts”.. dinner, movie nights, etc. She thought Danny would be a “fun hookup” from time to time, but nothing happened because Danny was too shy to make a move (I learned this from a friend).

Danny and I are dating now, but he is still friends with Jane. They talk almost everyday, go for walks and workout together every now and then. I know for a FACT that nothing sexual happens, but when he sees her in public his face lights up. I mean it does when he talks to me too but…yeah. I have constantly been going back and forth comparing myself to her throughout our whole relationship, wondering if I should be upset about their ongoing friendship. Recently I caved and snooped through his phone ( :/// I know) at their conversations. She is very flirty with him, referencing things like “their wedding,” etc. He sends her funny memes, and says things like ""Come watch me make dinner,"" “You never talk to me anymore :(“. When she posts a sexy bikini picture, he likes and comments an inside joke on it. They are close friends.

The other night, Danny and I were at the bar with a small group. She was there with another guy but she came up to Danny, sat on his lap, and started strattling him, kissing his cheek, rubbing her hands all over him going “oh my goshhhhh! Hiiii Danny!” I was sitting right there trying to play it cool. I even smiled and initiated giving her a hug. She acknowledged me (she knows we are dating) and came up to me and said “I’m sorry, I’m not trying to be violently aggressive... but just look at him!” and then proceeded to continue. Our friend that was sitting with us gave me a look like “are you okay?” and that's when I realized I wasn't being crazy, I quietly got up to leave the bar and said I’ll meet them later. Danny followed me immediately, but I ended up leaving again and basically cried in a bathroom stall the rest of the night (lol :/). The friend we were with texted me saying that I had the right to be upset and that she was in the wrong, blablabla, and that Danny was sad for me. Danny didn’t reciprocate anything she was doing and told her to stop but he was texting her later that night, still talking to her and I’m sure they have plans to hang out soon now that she is back in town starting a new job. He is acting the same as always with me again as though everything is normal… continuing to be dating me, but friends with her.

I don’t think Danny sees anything wrong with the situation. Their hangouts can easily be portrayed as just “friend” things and since they’ve never actually done anything physical together it’s not like she is an ex. I am certain she would never try to get with him on these hangouts, so it's not that part I'm worried about, it's the emotional flirting part. It just bothers me a bit that she clearly crossed a line the other night and his FRIEND was the one who vocalized that he felt sorry for me. Danny sympathized with me, but isn't going to change anything about his relationship with her.

As far as Danny is concerned, to me she is just a friend, but he doesn’t know that I’m actually aware of their history. **I don’t know how to bring this up to him without coming across as unattractively jealous**, or giving away that I went through his phone. I also don’t want to place restrictions on her which could just make her seem more desirable to him. I absolutely LOVE Danny and we have a 1000% incredible relationship together, but I can’t tell if he will always lust for her. So Reddit, I am wondering, is it reasonable for me to be unsettled at all of this, and how can I deal with this without seeming jealous?

**tl;dr**: My boyfriend still talks to his ex-crush that flirts with him, and doesn't realize that I think he is still attracted to her on some level. I am concerned about emotional cheating and don't know how to deal!"
"I[22F] just had a huge fight with one of my best friends[22F] because she's having sexual relationships with a minor [16M]


For the las 6 months this kid has been getting closer and closer to her. They perform together in the local band and he kept making subtle moves. She always joked that they really close friends and that she would marry him in 10 years. Things escalated fucking quickly during their town's festival (keep in mind this is Spain and in small towns this is the event of the year, two weeks ago), and he kissed her. She was drunk but he was not. Either way he kept messaging her and they ended up meeting several days to hook up. While she was completely sober. She has told us that she found this disturbing but ""what could she do if he's in love with me"". So yes, she accepted his sexual advances. He's a virgin and they haven't had sex yet, so I hoped I could stop it before they seal the deal. 

Today we went for some drinks together and my coward self mustered the courage to tell her that it's kind of fucked up, even if it's legal in our country (age of consent 16, he turned 16 this March). Told her that if she appreciates him (because she has said she doesn't love her) and he does really like her in two years they can do whatever the fuck they want. But for god's sake, he is a fucking kid. If it's fucking creepy when an older male does this to a minor girl this situation is equally creepy. Half of the world can't be wrong with an 18 yo age of consent. 

Sorry if this is more of a rant, and excuse my English and formatting and etc. I'm a bit drunk and really mad.

**TL;DR: I'm about to loose one of my bets friends[22F] because she's about to have sexual relationship with a minor [16M].**"
"I [29F] don't really want to tell my girlfriend [32F] anything anymore because she assumes things about the situation and interrogates me based on these false assumptions.


Dating for 3.5 years, been living together for 2 years.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

When I think back, this is not something new in our relationships. She's been acting this way since the beginning but I didn't really notice it before. Now, I notice it every time and I can practically predict that it's going to happen and exactly what she's going to say. Pretty much what happens is that I'll say something to my girlfriend - something that happened during my day at work, something from school that I got reminded of, whatever. And then my girlfriend will ask me follow up questions. But the way she asks me questions it that she'll have already made up what she thinks my real answer is and she'll interrogate me in a way to prove that what she thought was correct.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

There are multiple problems with this. The first being that this is all going on in her head, so she'll ask me questions related to \*her\* made up answer and to me it's so random I have no idea what she's talking about. The next problem is that she always has the wrong answer and if I say something that goes against it, she'll tell me I'm lying/she doesn't believe me. Another problem is that the ""answer"" she has in her mind is always related to me cheating/flirting with someone else/someone has a crush on me. Even when it's a story about my past she'll somehow relate it back to an ex, or an old friend that \*definitely\* had a crush on me (they didn't).

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

An example... We were talking about going to a restaurant and I'll say ""Oh, I've been to that restaurant before, maybe 5 years ago?"". And her first question is ""Who did you go with?"". I'll respond ""I think it was with my friend Mark?"". And she will go ""It was probably with your ex-girlfriend.""

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Another example... I'll mention that on my way home from work today I was on the same bus as a co-worker. She will ask what we talked about. I'll respond that we didn't really talk that much, I like to read my book during my commute home (Something she knows. I read on the bus every single day and go to the library 2x a week to get more books). And she'll say ""Yeah, right. You were probably chatting the entire time. What did you talk about? Did you talk about me? Does this person even know me?""

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

I can give so many more examples because it honestly happens every time I tell her something. It has now come to the point that I don't even want to tell her anything because it leads to these exhausting questions. I don't know what to do. If I don't tell her things about my day or don't answer her questions, she gets angry. She'll then call me out for being defensive which leads to even more questions.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR: I am so tired of my girlfriend's questions when I tell her about things in my life because she assumes that she knows the answer and if what I say (the truth) goes against her assumption, she'll tell me I'm lying. Also she always assumes that everything is about an ex or infidelity"
"How do you survive heartbreak like this?


Im gutted. My wife has always been my best friend, my partner in crime, my everything for 11 years and two kids. I know things have been stressful lately but not to this degree. She just admitted that she has been feeling empty for a long time and that she has lost feelings for me. She's harbored this on her own for almost a year, she says. Never came to me to talk about it or try and continued to act normal. When I asked her to try, she said that she doesn't want to.   


  
The most cliche part is that I also found out that she is having an affair with her boss. She just told me that I need to figure out how to let her go and move on with my life. How is this possible? This may not be new to her but it is all new to me, Im still the guy who is very much in love with a person who is no longer there. How do you handle this? How do I tell my kids who are so young?

"My (27F) family is having trouble accepting my fiancé (28M)


Throwaway. 

Me an J. have been together for 3 years and he just proposed to me last week. I haven’t told my family yet. I have two sisters (32F and 30F) both married, no children. I have been very lucky to be born in a well-off family. We never wanted for anything and because we were all girls, we were pretty spoiled. Not bratty or snobby though. Our parents paid for Ivy League colleges for all of us and we have no debt. My parents are in the property development business. All three of us sisters got our Master’s degrees. I currently work for a company but my sisters all got into the family business. What’s more is that both of them got the same classic American dream story of meetings their husbands in college, marrying after graduation and they are all 4 working on mom and dad’s business. Pretty lame if you ask me. 

Anyway. My fiancé is from a different dough. He grew up in a regular family (I guess middle class?), went to college but just for an Associate degree and is now working for $20/hr, 9-5. We are fine with money, I never ask anyone for help or anything but we are certainly not as comfortable as my sisters or parents. I work hard and I earn good money but my income is like 70% of our total income while my fiancé makes the 30%. 

During dinners or gatherings, my family always talks about their business, networking, new projects, stuff like that. They all work together and they see each other at the office all day but still have things to talk about at home. I’m interested in real estate too and I enjoy the conversations which are very informative but my fiance is bored to death. He doesn’t understand almost anything we talk and feels left out. I brought up this issue with my parents and sisters and they basically said, “well, if he had a brain it would be easier”. They think that because my fiancé almost never says anything, he doesn’t have an opinion or any knowledge. I didn’t yet tell them we’re engaged because all of them will probably just brush it off and be like, “I thought you’d find someone better”. 

What should I do? I don’t wanna cut my family off and I want to somehow make my fiancé fit in better. Any ideas?

TL;DR: my fiancé doesn’t seem to fit into my family "
"My girlfriend thinks i should pay all the bills and she wants to have a separate bank account if we get married


So I’ve been with this girl for a year and things have been pretty solid. A month ago we had a conversation about how bills should be handled between a married couple and she told me that she believes a man should pay all the bills. I told her it should be split according to income, so if I make 70% I pay 70% of the bills while she handles the remaining 30%. She eventually is sort of understanding after going back and forth for a day. Today she posts this meme saying “when you pay all bills instead of going half half... oh you a mannn mannn” corny meme... but anyways should I be worried? I just feel it’s completely inconsiderate to not want to help if you’re working full time. She essentially wants a separate bank account and she wants to save all her money while I shoulder all the bills. Sounds like BS to me!

TL;DR: my girlfriend thinks I should pay all the bills and if we get married she wants a separate bank account"
"I [23F] go to full time school. My husband [25M] is resentful for staying at home and he reminds me in fights.


I’m in a very regular schooling program that takes 40+ hours a week while my husband works at home. 

I’m a new wife and so I always grew up with the idea that I would take care and cater to my husband but that’s just not the reality after all. He works at home and doesn’t have 40 hours of week of work so he does in theory have time. I used to express my insecurities about how I wish I was the one ironing, washing, and cleaning for him but I just don’t have the time. I come home and have to study or sleep or breathe. He used to tell me that it’s okay, he just needs me to get through my school but today we got into a fight. He told me he hates that I sit on my ass while he works. 

I was shocked. 

I’m so insecure about how little I do but I try. Today when I woke up in the wee hours of the morning, I tried to clean while my coffee brewed. I try a lot, and I always feel inferior. I bring it up sometimes, and he reassures me I’m okay. But when we fight, he likes to throw that against me. 

I’m so hurt. I’ll never un-hear that I’m a lazy piece of shit. I don’t think tomorrow that he’ll mean that, but I’ve already heard it. My worst fears have been confirmed. 

I don’t know what to do. We have another 2.75 years of my schooling so. 

Help. 

TLDR; I feel insecure about not having time to be a good wife, and he tells me I’m a lazy piece of shit when he’s mad "
"I have ghosted my emotionally abusive boyfriend (29M) that I was spending thousands a month on. How do I repair my self-esteem and life?


 Title kinda says it all. I posted here before, but I deleted it because it made the top post and I was very scared he'd see it.

I finally cut him out after making a post here and getting so much feedback that he was entitled, bratty, and actually manipulative. Some people might remember the post, he was the guy for whom I bought everything. Most people said he was a user or an abuser, and a few said I was enabling him by doing everything for him. I agree--I was, I just never meant to be. It felt like it happened gradually until it became everything.

I was doing things like buying him groceries, supporting his vet bills, and even finding him jobs. He had moved back into his mom's house. He was still unemployed after years, not seeking education and not trying to improve his life.

He was a king at making everything into an ""us"" problem. For example, he might say we need to work on our sleep schedules. Me, shocked, would be like ""oh, um, what do I need to work on?"" Since while I sleep in time to time, my schedule is fairly consistent as I often have early morning appointments for work where I was recently promoted. He'd cite I woke up at noon...on a Saturday...and I'd be like yeah but every other day I was up before 10AM. I would say he woke up at 4PM most days, noon a few days, for the past FOUR weeks, so maybe he should try a schedule.

Then we'd have a huge fight.

Eventually I stopped correcting him. I would just agree with problems that became an us problem even though it would hurt to admit it or say it since I didn't think it was something I did. Eventually the us problems became me problems even when I didn't do the behavior. It sucked.

He would always tear me down, and always find ways to complain. Today he started off by saying he was really miserable, so I instantly was brought down to his depression. There was no way to cheer him up either; his anxiety made it so he felt bad and paranoid he was somehow dying, but he refuses to take medication, so we just have to live through (suffer through?) these incidents. I asked him what could make him feel better and the answer was nothing, but he still wanted to hang out. He ranted for about an hour over voice chat. I had today off from work due to working extra hard this week and suddenly was just exposed to all this negativity from him waking up at noon with misery.

I just kept thinking of all the Reddit comments asking what I got out of it. And when he finally blew up with me, as he always does, I just checked out.

Right now I feel supremely empty. I didn't even tell him why I'm going, it would do no good. He never listens to me. He was just yelling at me over a video game (our team was like 0-10, 0-9, and I was like 0-1, he was like 7-1 so he begin to blame me which didn't make sense since our team was playing way worse than me) and I just hung up the Discord call after he told me I was awful to play games with, removed him from everything, and blocked his number. I'm sick of feeling like this doormat to channel his misery. I love him and he is (was) my world, but it's like all he has are negative things to whine about or criticisms of me and I'm just so tired. Even if I buy him things he needs, he'll thank me briefly then within an hour whine about everything being awful.

It's always something. I feel like he would win the lottery and within an hour it would be a new thing: maybe he'd feel tired, so he would think he had a tumor, or something. He's incapable of actually not complaining.

It's like he's addicted to feeling bad for himself. No job, lives with his mom, and refuses to see a therapist/get medicated.

However now I'm just... sitting here... and I feel so alone. Like somehow he's the only person that ever loved me or ever will love me again.

What do I do?

**TL;DR my boyfriend lived off his mom and was pretty emotionally abusive. I was spending thousands a month supporting his lifestyle.  I have ghosted him. I feel very empty and alone. How do I stay strong?**"
"Mom (60's f) is upset none of her kids got her boyfriend a birthday card.


Tldr; Are we bad people because we didn't get mom's boyfriend of 9 months a birthday card?

My mom has been dating this man for 9 months. Before that she was single for several years after a divorce from our dad, married almost 30 years. My siblings and I (36 f) range from 26 to 42, two sisters and a brother (plus kids and SO's) were present for this small party my mom threw for him at his house. Pretty chill, her boyfriend ordered Mexican food from a local place, sister made a cake. 

No one got him a card. This guy is retired and has everything he wants. He is a great dude and makes my mom happy. If I got him a gift I swear he'd try to give it back. And I personally don't generally get cards for people because I hate getting them...they are just junk that hangs around until enough years go buy to justify throwing them away. 

Problem is that no one got him a card. My question is, should we feel bad? My mom asked in the middle of it all if anyone had and was obviously pissed that we didn't. If we were wrong, what can I do to make up for it?"
"I (20M) broke up with girlfriend (20F) of two years. Friends and family are all saying that I over reacted and am a bad person for hurting her like this.


We started dating in high school shortly after she got out of her second abusive relationship in a row. She was very depressed from this to the point of wanting to kill herself almost daily and cutting her self most of those days.

I helped her through most of this which none of our mutual friends or family know about. But it was pretty hard on the way through it. She was constantly attacking me. I spent the first year and a half being called worthless and a waste of space that should die pretty much everyday. It hurt me in a lot of ways and I still carry that baggage and the baggage from the multiple times she cheated on me that first year. It was 11 times if you want an exact number and that doesn’t count the times that if I upset her she would take nudes and send them to other guys and tell me what they said as punishment. All of this messed me up pretty bad and it has all affected our relationship a lot. I have been going to counseling and she has gotten a lot better in the sense of not wanting to die but she still isn’t very caring. 

We moved back to college for our second year and immediately she got into partying every night always getting black out drunk. I didn’t support this much and urged he to cut back especially because she was ending up staying over night at other guys houses because she was too drunk. I told her I was uncomfortable with this and that I did not like it and wanted to sit down and talk about it. She agreed and said she was busy for the next several days and couldn’t go. Long story short she was just lying and going to parties those days. She would tell me she was sleeping and then go out. I had a pretty bad night of depression and called her to get her help and she replied with I don’t care I’m busy with the sounds of the party in the back ground.

I lost it that night and broke up with her. I couldn’t handle the lying any more. I couldn’t handle the person she was being. That was a week ago and we have been civil to each other still being friends. But this morning she blocked me on everything and then I started getting attacked by her friends and family being told that I was terrible for doing this.

I am just not sure how to go forward now I feel like this is all my fault and that I caused all of it. I feel like the biggest mess up in the world now. Am I really in the wrong and terrible for doing this?

TL:DR broke up with girlfriend of two years and am now being called terrible and being blamed for hurting her by friends and family.

Any advice or words of wisdom would be really appreciated. Thanks"
"My boyfriend [22M] is moving in with me [25F] due to getting a job in my city, but now my parents are saying they can't come to my apartment for Thanksgiving.


My boyfriend recently got a job in my city, so the logical thing was for him to move in. My parents are super religious, so living together before marriage is a big no no to them. Granted, I told my parents that this could happen earlier this year and they said it's my life, you can do whatever you want. So I told them today that he got a job and now they are saying that they can no longer stay in my apartment for Thanksgiving. They also said they arent going to pay for hotel room stay either.  So to give context, my parents live in NC while I live in TX.  They have to fly to get to me. Now im stuck either paying a $650 hotel stay or kicking out my boyfriend for a week. I dont know why they cant compromise and suck it up for a week. I also suggested sleeping in different rooms in my apartment but they didnt even want to agree with that. I'm running out of ideas and my parents can't get their plane ticket money back. 

TL;DR Boyfriend is moving in with me. Parents are religious and won't live in the same home if my boyfriend is there. Parents are staying for a week. "
"My (19, M) first semester of college and I have a nightmare roommate (19, M)


I moved in about a month ago and as we grow more comfortable here this guy grows more inconsiderate. I have posted before complaining about his loud music but it is just getting worse, despite our daily protests. There are four boys in my suite and the rest of us and even those in the rooms next to us are tired of him. 

Every night around ten PM he starts blasting music out of his IHome. I have told him ten is quiet hour and not to do this, I have given him an extra pair of headphones. When someone comes out of their room to complain to him about turning his music down he says “my bad” but turns it back on later that night. I have told him to turn it off at 11 PM before only for him to turn it back on at 1.

Tonight he was in the shower listening to his music at full volume. I was getting texts from people I know in other rooms next to ours, saying “turn your freaking music down we’re tired of it every night”. I told him to turn it down and he walked out of the shower completely naked to turn it off. I think this was a power play because he did not want to turn his music off. I really wish I could erase that image from my mind. Despite him turning it off it is now two AM and he is blasting his music. He is in the shower again for some reason and I really don’t want to see him naked again. 

The other day he was absolutely freaking out, punching the wall as hard as he could and screaming. He put a dent in the wall. I told him to go to the counselor and calm down before he came back. He was upset because we all got an email telling us we’re having a meeting with our RA to discuss our multitude of noise complaints. I think my other roommates are scared of him. They often text me to tell him to turn his music down. I have bipolar people in my family so I am more used to dealing with these intense kinds of situation. 

I have told my RA before that he is just way too loud at night. They said they would handle it at the meeting. Even if that is handled, I just don’t want to live with this guy anymore. Everyone in the dorm hates him. A receptionist told me she keeps a number on speed dial when he is in the lobby alone with her because he is often shirtless and makes her uncomfortable. I feel bad kicking him out but I’m starting to think the best solution is to band together with my roommates and tell an RA that we don’t want to live with this guy anymore. I don’t even feel safe with him in here, he clearly has problems. I don’t really know what else to do at this point other than kick him out or move rooms. 

Tl~dr: roommate plays his music loud at unreasonable hours of the night despite daily protests from people in our room and neighbors near ours, flashed me today and has had scary anger freak outs. I don’t really feel comfortable living with him anymore and I don’t know what to do. "
"Boyfriend’s [22] female coworker[18] sent him drunken texts suggesting they did something


My boyfriend and I [21] have been officially dating for 2 months but seeing each other for 8 months. He’s had a coworker a month or so ago who he’s very flirty with, as he’s told me the conversations they’ve had. Others have asked them if they’re dating so it’s obvious they are very comfortable with each other. He gives her rides home every time she’s working a closing shift with him &amp; I’ve expressed my discomfort for it but he’s assured me that there’s nothing to worry about. A couple days ago she was texting him at around 9 pm at night saying she is kind of drunk and that she needs dick in the next week and to “buckle up” because he’s the dick. He laughed it off saying she’s drunk and they will talk when she’s sober. 

She then says “you have literally already dicked me honey”. Later that night, while I might mention that I was at his place since we sleep together every night, he’s texting someone and I see a notification pop up &amp; I know it’s her. I ask him to show me who he’s texting and he refuses and deletes their convo and tells me it was just his mobile carriers text that texted him. In a moment of spite I see his laptop and I grab it since it’s a Mac &amp; all his texts would have synced with it. I see that above convo that I mentioned before and he says he was hiding his phone right now because he didn’t want me to see that convo since I would take it the wrong way. 

Now the current texts at around 12 pm he is texting her if she wants to chill, since she’s bar hopping close to his place. He says he just wanted to have a smoke with her, I said there’s a convenience store across the street why didn’t you go &amp; get a pack. He said he didn’t want to get a whole new pack. ON TOP of everything a half hour before he was showering and shaved his chest and down below area. Aside from when we first started seeing each other, he quit shaving his chest as he got comfortable with me. I pointed out why he suddenly did that as he never does that and that it’s too much of a coincidence to do it suddenly when he’s about to go “have a smoke” with his coworker. His back was itching for a couple days so he uses that as an excuse saying he needs to see a doctor and his stomach was itching too so that’s why. Before I found him texting her he was telling me that he was going to go for a walk outside to walk off his “constipation”. 

He fed me some story and excuses to why everything is what it is, and the next day we had a huge fight where we almost broke up but i gave in and in my head told myself this is the last chance. He texted her that people think of them at work and that he has a gf so they need to cool off their friendship. Idk why but my gut feeling is off and I can’t shake off that her comment “you’ve practically already dicked me” means they’ve already done stuff except actual intercourse. If it’s any judge of character he’s told me about how he’s cheated on his previous gf’s. I told him I’m giving him one chance to come clean &amp; tell me if anything happened between them &amp; I would let it slide once but if I find out in the future then I’m walking away without a word, however he stuck on his previous stance and insisted nothing happened.

Am I being paranoid or is my fear valid that something happened between the two? 

TLDR; boyfriend’s coworker drunkenly texts her they’ve almost already had sex, he then was going to meet her later that night for a “smoke” but I caught on and he excused his way out. "
"My [28/F] bf [30/M] said he doesn't like it when I ask him when he's coming home among other things


My boyfriend told me he wasn't sure about our relationship last night because he hates it when I ask him everyday what time he's coming home and where he's going after work, etc.. He's been having irregular hours lately and I like to check in to see if he's coming straight after work or if he has something outside of work to do and if so, when he's coming home. It's something I've been brought up with and all my past relationships were fine with it. He told me last night he hates it when I hate that everyday (doesn't like that I want to know where he is all the time and what time he is coming home -- said he feels pressured to get home earlier because of my asking). I told him I don't care if you're out late but at least tell me you'll be out until 3am or so. Keep me updated. Yes, what if something happens to you, I need to know where you are or expected arrival time. I'm starting to feel like his mom because I wish he'd just tell me. I always tell him I'll be out from this time to this time at this event and so I'll be home around this time. I don't think it's a big deal. 

We've been dating close to 3 years and moved in together for 3 months now.

"I (27) am currently ""mediating"" a divorce between my parents. Mom doesn't want the divorce after Dad moved out 6 months ago. Dad threatening to get a lawyer that'll do the divorce but set them both back a lot of money. How do I convince Mom to get this divorce (or what do I say to her in general).


The state I'm in is a ""no fault"" state. Mom is upset about adultery on Dad's side and has some ""ideas"" about getting more than 50% in the divorce because that is ""fair."" Mom probably would score high in neuroticism in a big 5 questionnaire. Dad probably the opposite. Dad's reasoning for getting divorce now (and not waiting more) is to ""get his life in order."" Mom is in therapy to become less depressed. Mom often gets pretty angry at him. I don't know what he does to her.

What do I say to them (probably Mom)? (To get this divorce flowing, not-flowing or whatever)

"Me [35 M] and my wife [28F] of two years are happily married, but a flirtatious co-worker [39] is constantly probing for information about her. Is this just nosiness or what?


**TL;DR** Co-worker is invasive, but I may be taking it the wrong way.

Background: I'm a dude (35) working an office job. Happily married to my wife of two years (28). A new co-worker of mine has been flirtatious (not reciprocated), but I wrote it off as her being overly friendly. However, she regularly asks questions about my wife. They ranged from her age, to her occupation, and so on and so forth. We may be cordial and friendly but we are by no means friends. The other day she requested to see a picture of my wife out of the blue, citing ""her curiosity"". Maybe I'm jumping to conclusions, but that seems a little weird. Is it normal to be this nosy about relationships? What could this chick stand to gain by knowing more about my wife/what she looks like?"
"My ex [M32] from 8 years ago continues to contact me [F30]. He wants to talk about our breakup, I'm considering talking to him in exchange for him leaving me alone.


I dated Mike for ~6 months in 2010. For me, it was a fling, for him, not so much. I broke it off, telling him I wasn't interested, and he seemed to feel the same. About a month after the breakup though, he started harassing me; contacting me regularly through phone, email, social media, etc. He broke into my parents' house to leave tokens of our relationship (ticket stubs from events, a biscuit tin from a trip, etc.). 

Since then he has been trying to contact me through social media every few months, to the point where I have my privacy set to the strictest settings. The only remaining account that he can communicate through is an old email that I leave open because I fear his retaliation if he can't reach me at all. 

A couple of days ago, I received yet another message from Mike asking for me to clarify things and explain why he was a lousy partner because he's trying to be a better person. Am I crazy for considering it? I am thinking about setting up a time and speaking openly with him (not in person) about why we broke up, in exchange for him to leave me alone, and then if he doesn't bugger off, begin the process of filing a restraining order. 

ETA: I began dating my now-wife a few months after Mike and I broke up, and she is also torn on this issue. 

TL;DR: My ex won't stop contacting me, but said he would if I answered some questions. Am I crazy to consider it?

"Scared but ready to leave (22f)


Throwaway account due to some pretty obvious details. My husband and I got married when I was 18 after dating for 3 months. Yeah. Dumb. I know. Anyways, fast forward, we have a 2 year old together and for the most part everything’s been fine. 

Around 2 years ago he brought up the idea of us having and open relationship, initially it was supposed to be don’t ask, don’t tell type of thing but I later learned he had a cuckhold fetish and is turned on by me being with other guys. But also is extremely jealous with the whole thing, he only wants me to sleep with guys as in no hanging out or getting to know them at all or anything. Now I know it’s because of insecurity issues he has with himself. He thinks I’m going to leave him for any guy I see but he also still get off to me fucking other guys. Thin line I guess. 

Being a stay at home mom for about 1 1/2 years, my confidence level went down, I lost all my friends, I started noticing my relationship going downhill, him being verbally mean to me, blaming me for everything, talking to me like a dog, etc. I eventually got a job as a bartender about a year ago and it’s really changed me. I’m confident. I make enough money to support myself. The attention I get made me realize that it’s not okay to be treated the way I do.  And overall I just started to realize how unhappy I am. 

I’m just over everything. I’m not attracted to him any more and it’s always an issue of me not initiating sex. And I always fancy myself with other guys who I am attracted to. 
He treats me so bad. We’re always arguing over something. Everything’s always my fault. I don’t clean enough. I don’t want sex enough. I sleep too much. I don’t text back fast enough. I get excited to hang with my girl friends but not him. Etc. 
I’ve realized I could be much happier on my own. I don’t want my son around us basically yelling all the time. My family would be 100% supportive. And I’m not dependent on him at all. (I pay my part + of all the bills even though he makes an insane amount more money than me, but I’m happy to be independent)

Plus we have NOTHING in common. 

The only things holding me back from leaving are out child. My husband is a great father and I love that. But I hear so many horror stories of children growing up in broken homes. 

And my husband has serious depression/anxiety problems. He’s been to doctors and been prescribed medicines but doesn’t care/want to take them no matter how much I beg. He has a family history of suicide and has hinted at killing himself if I were to leave him. And I couldn’t live with that. 

But I know that I’m entirely too young to feel like I’m stuck in a relationship and feel this unhappy. 

I don’t know what to do. 

**tl;dr.   Married young. Lost of problems including an open relationship. Just unhappy and ready to leave**"
