"My son [16m] and his father [32m] got into an actual, physical fight. What steps do I [32f] need to take to keep my kid safe?


My son's father recently moved back East after his tech company went under. He hasn't always been the most reliable father, he visited sporadically and *tried* to call once a week, but I never considered him to be a danger for my son to be around. 

Well, he's been visiting for the weekend, which I thought was really nice. My son didn't agree. His father was staying on our couch and my son was being pretty miserable about it, sulking in his room and avoiding spending any time with either of us. I get it, he has issues with his father, but I was really hoping we could try to move past that this weekend. 

Well, it all came to blows last night when my son and his father got into an argument and turned violent. I fully admit my son threw the first punch. And second. And maybe third. But then his father started walloping him too and I couldn't break them up. 

By the end of it they were both covered in bruises. My son even has a black eye. I grounded my son and threw out his father. I think he's staying at his parent's house right now. I told him to stay the Hell away from my son and never speak to either of us again, but he's been calling my phone and my son's phone non-stop all morning. 

What do I do? This guy beat the shit out of my son? How do I keep him away from us?

tl;dr My son's father was staying over for the weekend when he and my son got into a violent fight. I kicked my son's father out of the house and told him never to speak to us again, but he's been trying to call us all morning. How do I keep him away from us?"
"I [18M] am in love with my cousin [17F]


In my culture, marrying your cousin isn’t considered incest. She’s got most, if not all, of the qualities I would want in a girl.

We spend little time together on the weekends, but the time we spend together feels special. We get along perfectly, laugh, and smile together. Her expressions hit me deep. I want to get to know everything about her, what she loves and hates, from hobbies to movies and shows and food.

I just have no idea what to do in this situation. I think about her every night. I just don’t know if she feels the same way about me

TL;DR: I’m in love with my cousin and I don’t know what to do."
"I [23F] Have Never Had A Best Friend [21F] Until Now.


My childhood was pretty lonely. I never had friends at school, and if I did, they'd end up turning around and bullying me or telling me that they only wanted to be friends with me until they found somebody better. I ended up giving up on having friends by 13, other than the ones I had online (This is important). I pretty much just ate in the library or on my own in the bathroom at lunch. I dated all through high school and early college which was easy for me, I'm not bad looking, but the problem was I felt like I could only have a genuine connection with somebody my age if there was some sort of \[sexual\] relationship involved. Because of this, now, I'm really kind of awkward. I have trouble making friends, and when I do, they aren't very good ones.

&amp;#x200B;

Just in the last 2 years I met a girl at work and we became pretty close over the course of a year. Then, she started talking to this guy that I really got along with and loved for her, and I convinced them to date. We started going on couple dates (her, her bf, me, and my bf) and it was really great, that's how she and I really started getting close.

&amp;#x200B;

Nowadays, she and I hang out often, maybe once a week, sometimes more, sometimes less.

&amp;#x200B;

Less than a week ago we were messaging and she told me that I was her best friend, and that she really prizes me as a person. That felt amazing because I've never had a genuine friendship before where somebody chose me... As the person they want to hang out with and be friends with without any \[relationship\] strings attached. The problem is these conversations that we have that are really deep and thorough always happen over messenger, maybe cause they're too awkward in person?

&amp;#x200B;

I guess my problem is... I'm so anxious. I'm anxious that she'll meet somebody else and end up liking them more than me, I'm anxious that she'll get bored of me and not want to hang out anymore. I'm anxious that my anxieties will turn into jealousy and I'll accidentally push her away. She hangs out with other groups of friends, which is PERFECTLY FINE, but while she's hanging out with them I'm kind of left feeling... Scared? And alone.

She has similar anxieties, as she has had trouble with friends in the past, but nothing like me. I know this because I've told her about my friend anxieties, and we bonded over our awkwardness.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

And on top of that I'm so WEIRD about touching, I don't like touching and she's such a hugger, and she's very touchy with everybody else but me, and she's told me it's because she wants to respect my boundaries, but I don't want her to. I want to have that girl bond that I see other girls have... I just put off such an awkward vibe, and how do I really bring it up without sounding like I have a crush on her? Because I absolutely do not. It's just sometimes we have moments where she'll literally say, ""I would so hug you right now!"" But then she doesn't, and I know it's because I'm so stupidly awkward.

&amp;#x200B;

Anybody have any insight on anything I said? Experience maybe that could help me out? I'm just trying so hard to have a normal friendship and it's just really scary for me.

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR: Never had close friends before, now that I do I'm super awkward, and don't know how to feel more comfortable."
"I [18M] am jealous at my friend with benefits [30F] without any apparent reason, should I end it?


Before I start telling this story, I'd like to say I'm writing this at 2am while trying to cope with an immense amount of stress. Unfortunately, this whole situation is keeping my focus away from my prelims so I had to put my struggle on paper and get help quickly. Please excuse any spelling or grammar mistakes, I will look it over if I have some time tomorrow. 

Exactly a month ago, I got in contact with a match on tinder. Let's call her Ellie. She was no ordinary match. Not only is she a single mum, she's also twelve years older than I am. After a couple days of talking we agreed to meet up in our Christmas break, about two weeks from that day. The next day, it turned out her best friend was sick and now she had a babysitter for no reason and asked if I wanted to go out with her that night. Of course I did. We walked around town for a bit and we hit it off. The age difference seemed to disappear within the second we started talking and soon we went back to her place. We never really discussed anything but since I have a great wish to move to the United States and she doesn't, we mutually agreed to make this friends with benefits. 

In the course of the past four weeks, I saw her another five times. In some cases solely as friends, without the benefits. I also met her daughter. Ellie and I really have a good connection. We've both been through quite a lot and we understand each other in every possible way. Sometimes I even got the idea, she wanted more than what we currently have. For example by holding my arm in the supermarket, telling me she wants to kiss me in public. She did tell me she was talking to a guy, let's call him Billy, and that she was developing feelings for him. I said I appreciated that she shared that with me. 

Now comes the weird part. I'm not entirely sure if I have feelings for Ellie. But the the fact that she's calling with Billy up until the midst of the night and how excited she is about him does make me feel jealous. It's like I don't feel special enough to her. Like it means more to me than it does to her. The only time I didn't feel that way is when I asked her about what she'd do if Billy said she couldn't hang out with me anymore because of our history. She said that Billy could bugger off then. 

Before I get to my conclusion, I should also note that she is open to have a non-monogamous relationship which means our friends with benefits could continue if she ends up in a relationship with Billy. Not sure how he feels about this though. Also, I'm not completely sure yet if I could stay friends if the benefits were to stop. It's not like our friendship is built on the benefits but I'm afraid I'm going to miss the deeper connection that truly bonds us. 

Should I end everything with her now? Before my feelings for her start to develop/escalate? Should I talk to her how I feel? I'm not sure what to do right now, as this is the first thing close to a relationship that I've had every since I was fourteen. 

Thanks in advance! 

TLDR; Jealous at my FWB for expressing feelings towards a different guy. Not sure if it's feelings or just a difference in perspective. "
"My (27F) boyfriend (28M) fantasizes about having two wives. I'm pretty open minded but I have no idea how feasible this is.


My bf often fantasizes of living with and caring for me and another girl.  He talks of having two wives and making us both pregnant and having a happy family, usually only during sex to get himself going. It simultaneously turns me on and makes me jealous. It practically and legally concerns me since it's non-negotiable for me to be the one he is legally married to and holds the primary position in the relationship. 

So far, we live together at my parents' house getting our lives together. He's currently unemployed and i have a job at a college but its not enough to move us out. There's nobody else seriously in his life as far as I know.  He talks of this ""other girl"" during sex and I think it's mostly just a made up character, and I have to admit the way he describes living with us and caring for our needs riles me up.

I'm no stranger to open relationships. My bf and I were in a V in college, with me in the middle dating both him and another girl. That whole situation fell apart and we all broke up. Two years later my bf moved back in town and we caught up and ended up back together, but we're still figuring out how to define how this reincarnation of our relationship. I require the security of knowing that we are legally bound together in marriage and our children are legally recognized as ours. I have no idea how he expects another girl to be some kind of live in waifu and be legally secondary to me, leaving any children he has with her at risk. I have many doubts. 

I'm 27. I'm at the point in my life where I'm looking to hunker down and create a future and plan for a family with someone. I'm open to negotiating a V situation, but I also want society, my family, and my friends to recognize the legitimacy of my relationship with him. He says he's open to marriage and kids with me, but I don't think he understands the weight of how important negotiating the practicalities of such a rare situation are. He seems to focus too much on the fantasy of sex with two women. I don't know how to bring up how serious this is to our relationship or just dismiss it as a fantasy.

TLDR: My bf talks about having two wives during sex and I've had an open relationship with him in the past. I'm a little concerned but pretty open minded but I don't know if I need to take him seriously."
"My girlfriend [20,F] and I [21,M] have been dating for 2.5 years and she won't get intimate in our long distance relationship.


Firstly, I am using a throwaway because my friends know my real reddit username.

Here is the full story, My girlfriend and I have been dating for 2.5 years now, we are in a very serious, loving and strong relationship. We started dating in college and spent a lot of time together, but everytime during the holidays, each of us goes back to our home country sometimes for upto 4 months. Now, I am not someone who has a high libido, and my gf has low libido, but every time we spend time apart, there are days where I ask her to send me some intimate pictures (yes, nudes). She claims its because its ""awkward"" to take these pictures. I have assured her multiple time that its a two way street.

Additionally, she encourages me to watch porn instead even after I have made it clear to her that I won't. She does have body issues, and I try to reassure her that she is an incredibly beautiful girl.

I am not sure if I am an asshole for asking for nudes, or what I should do? I was thinking if y'all can help me out! Thank you in advance!

TL;DR: My gf and I who have been dating for 2.5 years cant seem to get intimate while doing long distance.

"A online friend [19F] cut me off yesterday [18M]. We only talked for about two weeks total.


She sent me a PM over Reddit and we chatted a bit. After about a few days, she cut contact because she thought she wouldn't be a good friend. After about a week, I convinced her otherwise and we resumed talking. 


We would text about random things: the weather, classes, what we did during the day. It seemed that everything returned to normal. Yesterday, she cut me off, saying that it was her fault yet again.


So today, I texted her to try to figure out what was wrong this time. Saying that it was her fault twice doesn't ring right. It's more likely that it was something I did. That was my thought process. 


Unfortunately, she didn't take it too well. She told me to leave her alone.



My instinct tells me to do something about it, but at the same time, I know that I should leave her alone.


I have a few questions for you guys:


1. How do you guys move on from friendships that just abruptly stop?
2. How do you get people to confide in you? I believe part of this problem might be her self-loathing from her previous relationships.
3. If I should even try talking to her, what should I even do?
4. Does she actually even want to hang out with me?


TL;DR An online friend that I only knew a short while dramatically cut ties, saying only that she thinks she is a terrible person.

"My [39M] daughter [13F] dreams of having aesthetic eye surgery and I think my wife has enabled it. How do I handle this?


There's this thing called double eyelid surgery in which a surgeon extracts the fat inside the eyelid and then does a fold thing with the skin and many people in several Asian countries think it's beautiful.

To be honest I find it silly. I have seen and met women before and after and a beautiful woman is just as beautiful after the surgery, to me, nothing changes. My wife had it done just like her two sisters, and my daughter sometimes talks about how she thinks celebrities who had it done are beautiful and she'd like to do it too.

It's somewhat common for some Korean parents to pay for it when the girl turns 18. Honestly, I'd rather not do it. I don't think the surgery in particular is bad in itself or anything like that, but I think a lot of girls grow up thinking that's how they are supposed to look and if they don't then they are not beautiful.

I asked my daughter why she wanted to one day have it done and she said it was because she wants to look like her favorite celebrities. I asked her if she thought she wasn't beautiful as she already is and she pondered for a few seconds before telling me she didn't know. I told her I thought she was already beautiful and she doesn't *need* to have surgery. I told her this is a conversation we would have again several times over the years and I didn't judge her for wanting any surgery, but because I think she's trying to ""correct"" herself and it's coming from what I think is a bad place.

My wife doesn't think there's anything wrong with the surgery and several people in her family have had it. I have seen some of her nieces have it done and it kinda seems like some strange rite of passage to me, but I admit I am partial about it so I am not the best judge.

Anyway, what's the best way to handle this? Am I right, wrong? How should I handle the subject with my wife and daughter? This ""fixation"" began a relatively short time ago for my daughter and I want her to consider several sides of it before eventually making any decision about it. I want to make sure she's not doing it out of a sense of inadequacy with herself, which I think is something I have seen in other girls.

**tl;dr:** Daughter wants to have a common aesthetic eye surgery in the future and I fear she might be doing it out of a sense of insecurity with herself. How do I handle this situation considering her mom had it, too?"
"An old friend [27M] of mine [26F] that ghosted me a few years ago for undisclosed reasons is recetly kind of ""poking"" me on social media (but in a really confusing way) and I don't know what to think.


**Brief backstory**: This boy, let's call him Tommy, used to be my neighbor. We became friends around middle school and remained pretty close until I'd say 4 years ago. It was never anything romantic (actually, we're both gay), just a really close friendship, since we'd have a lot of shared interests and, at the beginning, views. In time with our mutual friends we'd for a tight-ish circle, but Tommy and I were always the closest. I'd describe him by smart, loving, protective of those he cares about, very jealous/envious. More of a follower than a leader type.

It started slowly going to hell when Tommy got really infatuated with a boy, ""Peter"", and started expressing very toxic, controlling and abusive behavior towards him. Peter himself was a weird guy and I didn't particularly like him, because he had some particular weird, kind of traditional/conservative views which Tommy would surprisingly eat up without thinking (but that was actually very like him, to just adapt his mindset to people he was close with) that were: 1) quite offensive to me as a woman and a lesbian and 2) kind of baffling coming from a gay man. At least despite wronging Tommy many times, Peter was always adamant to make it up to him and in fact treated him moderately well (which Tommy clearly used to control him). It was a mess. Peter was bad for Tommy, Tommy was horrible for and to Peter. Still, that was none of my business, so I only found myself pointing out/criticising their life choices a few times when they crossed all of the lines and screamed ""abuse alert"" to me. It was never received badly, though, I acted more like a mediator.

About 4 years ago, when our relationship was slowly getting worse, after a few awkward, sometimes a little hostile (because we just drifted apart so much that basically every subject became taboo) meetings, Tommy ghosted me, all of the friends from our group and some distant mutual friends. By ghosted I mean: stopped picking up the phone, removed and in some cases blocked us from his facebook, etc. (but note that it was not after any particular meeting, any fight; last time I saw him was 4 months prior and I suddenly realized that we're not friends on facebook anymore). I was hurt, but I also saw it coming, as Tommy was a very emotionally unstable individual and he had history of ghosting friends like that before. I would know, because said friends would often come to me to ask ""dude what the hell, this came out of the blue"". It would often happen without him even having strong feelings against them, he would just decide that they are not fun to be with anymore (which would often be linked to them having moral and political views different from Peter's). 

I was a little upset that I didn't even get a ""gtfo, but thanks for the memories"" note after us being important parts of each other's lives for 12 years, but what can you do. I for sure didn't do nothing about it, just moved on with my life a bit hurt. I also dream about Tommy all the time, because my mind clearly still considers him someone very important.

(***short version****: Tommy, my childhood best friend and I drifted apart hard a few years ago and after a while of simply not contacting any of us he pulled off his classic move - ghosting everybody in our tight social circle (and some people outside of it) to the point of blocking many of us on social media and not returning calls. We haven't contacted each other since, although I tried a few times to no avail.)*

**Fast forward to now:** Recently I've been getting a lot of non-direct social media activity from Tommy. Despite us not being connected on any social media, we still belong to the same nerdy/lifestyle groups on facebook, we also both have instagram. So for example he started following me on instagram and react to some of my pics and instastories using very weird, unfitting emojis, like fire or laughing emoji (when what I posted is not funny at all). Recently I attended a wedding of our old mutual friend and she posted a few of the wedding photos (Tommy was not invited to the wedding, since she was among the ghosted people) with me and other of his old friends tagged there. He again reacted to them in a very absurd way, which actually upset the friend, as she was initially very hurt with him ghosting us and I think she's the one in our old group of friends who had the most trouble moving on. He would also react to my facebook posts and comments on groups we both belong to, again, in a very unfitting way, never actually replying.

One one hand, it seems that he's being passive agressive (which would fit him), but I can hardly imagine why would anyone, be passive agressive towards a person they haven't seen in a few years in a facebook post about digital painting tools or an indie video game. On the other hand, if he was poking me trying to get attention from me, maybe reconcile or something, why not use a more direct approach and why react in such a confusing way? I don't want to go as far as to say that he's low-key messing with us, but I cannot lie, this thought has crossed my mind.

*Yes, I know this is a nonexistant problem, but honestly I am a very anxious person, a part of me is still clearly hurt by how our friendship escalated and also I find myself facing this kind of issue for the first time in my life.*

In case he wants to bother/confuse me I decided not to react to it for now, but I am wondering what that may be. After all, writing him ""why are you reacting weirdly to my facebook posts!???"" sounds really pathetic, so I'd rather refrain from that, at least for now.

Do you have any advice as to how to react to this without blocking him or leaving all the groups we share if he keeps this up? I know you don't know neither me nor him, so you can only speculate about his reasons, but what do you think makes him do this?

**tl;dr An old friend who ghosted an entire tight circle of friends (me included) started to recently ""bother"" us (but mostly me) on social media with unfitting and confusing reactions to posts in shared groups (despite not being ""friends"" with any of us) and the like. I don't know how to react if he keeps this up and if this is malicious well-intentioned. Any advice/theory on why could he be doing that?**"

"I've been distant from my girlfriend for a long while, hurt her, and she left me. She may be willing to try couples counseling. I'm emotionally inept, which contributed heavily to the breakup. I need help figuring out what to do if she says yes.


What the title says, really. Im gonna try (and likely fail) to be vague because she uses reddit regularly.

In short about me, Im emotionally inept. The people who should've been raising me with love and care or what have you, provided for me and all. But they didn't *love* me. They didn't show much affection, ever. Most affection I ever knew, and the only way I know how to even display affection for others, is buying stuff. My peers in school weren't any better; they were all awful. For years, I wasn't just disliked, I was the schools verbal punching bag, every day. So I didnt go to school much. I was a shut in by 6 years old, only kept company by video games. When I did go to school, i was constantly reminded how much everyone hated me and how awful I was, outside of a few friends. This, frankly, fucked me up. Bad. I dont know how to express emotion, show love, make gifts, etc. I try, but after a while I just kind of always gave up, because I could never do any of it right, put my feelings into words or give them form.

But that was okay with her. My girlfriend always showed me so much love, and made me feel so important. She loved me like no one else ever had. She understood that I just couldn't figure out how to do the same things she does for me, but was fine with me just loving her. And I do. I love her so, so much. More than anything, or anyone. Even though I can't express it beyond these kinds of very simple explanations of my feelings, she, quite frankly, is my world. Everything I want from the future, everything I love about my life, always has to do with her. If we had gotten together later in life and were farther along and past college, I'd have proposed by now, because I want to spend my forever with her.

Over the years though, my depression got significantly worse. I've been losing motivation constantly. I've let my mind slip so badly that I've pushed all my friends away because I was afraid they secretly hated me. I recently started having the same issue with her, but to be honest, its been affecting our relationship for over a year now. I cant drive, and Ive been depending on her for so much, I made her feel used and unimportant, and I dont blame her. And I pushed her to her breaking point. 

Without giving out details, I hurt her, really bad. I irrationally felt like she disregarded me in a situation she obviously didnt. I was upset, hurt, and felt bad. So I got a bad, disregarding attitude with her, and hurt her worse. I wish I could take it back so badly, but I cant. With this and the last year and a half of me being emotionally distant(moreso than usual), I made her feel like I genuinely don't care about her. So she broke up with me.

She said she wants space, so even though its incredibly hard, Im trying to do so. She also said that its possible we could get back together in the future, just not now, because she's hurting really bad, because of me.

Last month we'd already had a close call, where the possibility of couples counseling was mentioned and planned, but we couldn't at the time. Now we can. So I messaged her, asking her just to consider it. That I want to do couples counseling and more frequent individual therapy(already doing this part, when I go next, we'll be starting neurological treatment). I told her she doesnt have to respond right now, or resume normal contact when she does answer, nor pretend things are back to normal if she says yes. Just, whenever she's ready.

So there's that. The message was way more eloquent, and I promise, far less like begging than it probably sounds. The point was that I want to become the loving, caring individual that can love her and care for her like she deserves. I want to be better for her.

I should've gone to counseling a lot sooner, or even just asked reddit about this kind of thing at the very least, but I've let my shame keep me away from it for far too long. I should've done this for her from the start.

I suppose, in a sense, what I'm asking is help to figure out how to force myself to functionally reset how I treat her. The idea is that therapy will be able to help with many of my issues, but that'll likely take a very long time.

I want to know what kinds of things I can do to show her how much i love her, how much I care for her and appreciate her. To make her feel loved, and cared for. How committed I am to making the progress and change that I need. How committed I am to her. What kind of gifts can I make for her to show her, little gestures, big gestures, everything.
The kinds of things I can say, things I can do. Anything and everything.

I killed my relationship by knowing nothing and doing nothing.

I know I waited too long.

I just want to do right by her now *if* she gives me the chance.

Please help me. Please. I really have no idea what I'm doing, and I just want to do things right if I do get the chance. I can't stand to lose her. I can't. She might think she means little to me, but she couldn't be farther from the truth. She is everything to me.

If she gives me a chance with counseling, I want to do it right. I want to be better. I just need help knowing how to show that.

Tl;dr I really fucked up, caused the most wonderful part of my life to feel uncared for, but she might be open to the possibility of couples counseling. I am emotionally inept, and don't know how to really express care and love very well at all. I want to do that for her. I want to be the person she deserves. I want to know the kinds of things I can do to show her how much I love and care for her, and how committed I am to her and to being the person she deserves."

"How many times can I ask a guy out before it gets weird?


 Quick background: I \[22f\] have been interested in this guy-friend \[23m\] for years now but for one reason or another, we have never gotten really close. I am pretty forward when it comes to dating so I asked him out about two years ago, he agreed and we had a nice time. Then I tried to set up another date but he politely declined. I found out later that he didn't want to start any relationship because he was going to study abroad for a year. We wrote each other somewhat consistently while he was gone, but just as friends. Then he got back for Christmas and I saw him at a holiday party. Long story short, his best friend came up to me at the end of the party and told me to ask this guy out. I got my hopes up a little, and asked if he wanted to meet up. He agreed and we went out last week and it went great! Since then we've been texting a few times a day. Anyway, here's my question. Should I ask him out again? Normally I'd say no because I don't like to look desperate. But this guy is the shy type and might be hesitant to make a move. So how soon/how many times can I make a pass for this guy before it comes off as creepy and too pushy? 

TL;DR I asked out an old guy-friend and the date went great, should and how can I pursue the relationship without being too forward if this guy is shy and possibly hesitant to ask me out?"

"Dear (26M) boyfriend. Should I (24F) send to him?


	I know I've been acting weird, and maybe in your eyes, I may even be upset.  And you're right. I am upset, and I feel hurt. I am feeling lately, like I'm not enough for you. I feel insecure, and I feel like you're getting bored of me. Why? Because of the stuff I am starting to see. Every time we go out, I always catch you watching a pretty girl walk by. And do I say something? No. Because I know you'll deny it, but your eyes don’t lie, and I can see that you're unashamed and eager to look. And you do it in front of me too like I don't notice these things. For example, when we were at Mcdonalds for lunch yesterday, some girl that you probably thought was cute or pretty walked in, and you couldn’t tear your eyes away. You glanced, looked at me, then rediverted your eyes back to look at her, and may I quite add, for a long time. But I stay quiet, because it's just going to make me feel worse when I confront you about it, you deny and lie to me about it. And I know it's your ""biological code"" that men look at attractive women, but I don't appreciate it, and I feel disrespected. At least try to make it not noticeable. You make me feel really self-conscious about myself, and how you feel towards me. I truly feel like you're looking to find someone else. Then today at lunch I felt like you were hiding your phone, and your watch from my eyes. You kept your phone in-between your legs, not on the table. And then you raised your watch so far to your face so that no one else could see what notifications you were swiping away. I didn't want to bring any of this, and just stomached it, and just silently let it bother me, but its becoming too much and I can't handle it anymore. If you are unhappy with me, and if you want to be free to look at other women, and pine after them please leave me. Because even though at the end of the day you come home to me, and I'm the one you're falling asleep next to, it's becoming not enough. Having to convince myself every day that you still only have eyes for me is tiring, especially when I should KNOW that you only have eyes for me. I should KNOW you only want me, but I don't. Because I'm seeing things that tell me otherwise.

"My (28) girlfriend (25) is working abroad for a year and I'm paranoid


 I have been cheated on by two women in the past. One in particular came as a massive shock. Since then, I could never feel absolutely confident that my current partner would never cheat on me. Regardless of what a good person they seem like, the girl in the past seemed just as nice but still ended up cheating on me.

What makes things worse is my current girlfriend has a tendency to have a lot of guy friends. I don't want to be petty, jealous and controlling so I'm not about to tell her to stop having guy friends. We've dated for almost 3 years. She's been working abroad for 6 months now and will be working there for another 6 months. And as usual, she's made several guy friends. Some of whom she occasionally has lunch with.

Should I be worried or am I being paranoid? Nothing about her makes me think she'd cheat, but I thought the same about my ex. The worst part is that my ex cheated on me with her best friend, so the ""just friends"" assurance is not very reassuring.

Tl:dr; My girlfriend works abroad and I'm paranoid about her cheating on me because I have a history of being cheated on. What should I do? Should I just suck it up?"
"27 (F) always single


Hello everyone, so here is a little backstory. I am a twenty-seven year old female and I have the trait of perpetual singleness. 

 **TL;DR** I am twenty-seven and recently moved back to my favorite college town to  accept a job with the university. I have tried dating apps, but I have only been on one date in my entire life, and that was back in August of last year. The guy and I continue to talk daily, and have had relationship conversations before, but I just think friendship is all that it is at this time. I know I am falling for him, and I am honestly pretty scared. I have not tried to date anyone else, simply because I just don't feel like I get attention from guys very often. One guy on Bumble told me recently that I ""have all the features of a male but long hair and a girl's name"" and it honestly left me feeling so insecure. I just do not know what to do at this point. Any help/advice would be greatly appreciated!"
"I (29M) broke off my engagement to my fiancée (27F) after being together for nearly a decade. I'm at a total loss, and still in shock.


My fiancée and I have been together for nearly a decade. In fact, we were due to get married on our tenth anniversary. I finally called her out on her recent constant messaging with another guy (hundreds of snapchat messages per day). When we finally had a talk about it last night, it came to light that she wants to ""work on herself"" or something similar. Essentially, it turned into the cliche, ""it's not you, it's me"". 

I need some guidance, or something. I'm in a lease with her. We've lived together for about 5 years. I'm still rather numb to be honest. I never expected that I'd have to break off or engagement and ultimately will likely break up as a result. 

She says she wants to ""learn to grow up,"" and ""get her shit together"" essentially, which I don't disagree with. When I asked about her plan with this sort of stuff, she said she'd ""sink or swim"". That sounds incredibly self destructive. Unfortunately, had I not called her out after seeing all these red flags, I'd likely just be seething with anger still but nothing would've changed in our relationship; however, I was finally, after a couple-three weeks of observing this odd behavior (remember, we've been together for about a decade, so I'm *pretty* acquainted with her behavior) that made all kinds of red flags come up. 

I'm in a lease with her too, and trying to finish grad school, so this couldn't have come at a worse time for me. Should I  just cut my losses and just say fuck you,  I'm done; never speak to me again? 

She kept saying how much she loves me (yadada yadada) firing this conversation, particularly when I outright asked if she still did. That it really is her personality she wants to improve or something equally as cliché.

I told her the engagement is cancelled indefinitely. I don't need this in my life. 

Why would she insist that she does indeed love me despite all this shit, and asked for a hug before she went to set up an air mattress in another room (I declined the hug, and have kicked her from the bedroom since the bed is mine).

Please, i need some sort of insight. I feel numb, empty, lost, and pretty hurt over all of this. 

**TL;DR** Cancelled engagement with fiancée of 10 years. She insists she still loves me and expressed interest in possibly reviewing the relationship after she's ""figured herself out"". I'm unconvinced and feel like once it's over, it's over. How do I proceed with these things. 

(Sorry of this is jumbled or incomprehensible in areas. I'm still reeling as this only happened within the last 12 hours.)"
"After ten years of marriage and doing it all, intimacy has kind of hit a dead end for my wife (36F) and myself (35M). What should be our next steps?


My wife and I have been married just around a decade, we were together going back as far as high school.  We were each other's first and only's for the most part (more on that in a second), and are very much still in love and committed to each other.  We have a few issues, which is why I'm here obviously, but we're very much in it for the long haul.

In the recent year or so, intimacy has become a bit of a challenge for us.  It's not that anything is wrong or missing, it's just that we've practically done it all at this point.   From roleplaying, toys, even a threesome once, we've done everything.  At this point we know each other so well, we can anticipate each other's moves like we're reading each others minds.  On one hand that's great because we know what each other likes and everything, but on the other hand it has made intimacy just a been there, done that for us in every aspect.  Nothing is ever really all that new or special anymore.

The natural next step for us to try to expand was to try to meet other people to get into the mix.  We had some luck with that once, but haven't had any at all since.  We're in a relatively rural area of the Southeastern U.S. where minds aren't necessarily open, so options are slim.  My wife has also mentioned she'd love to try something with another woman, which I have no issue whatsoever with.  Neither of us are going anywhere.  I think otherwise it would have to involve the two of us as a package deal, but her with a woman is something I've got no issue with at all.  But that's tricky because she's very introverted, and like I said, options are slim.  I hate to see her discouraged about that.

I try not to put much thought into it because I know the options are few and even fewer people would want to get with a married couple or married person, but it still kind of sucks to hear when friends get lucky with that kind of thing.  It's like we're only expected to be kind of lame people who never would do that, and we feel kind of judged and left out to not have the opportunities to pursue it.  I think both my wife and myself regret getting married relatively young and not having made a few fun mistakes when we were younger.

But besides all that, the problem still remains of that dead end.  We have no idea what the next steps would be, or even if there are any next steps even available to us.  Something between the two of us is the first option, with anything else just being icing on the cake, but that just seems near impossible for us.  We both feel a little bummed out over it and aren't sure what to do.  Anyone have any advice?

TLDR - My wife and I have hit a dead end when it comes to intimacy, we've done it all that we can with just the two of us.  We'd like to explore more with just the two of us, or maybe even others, but are discouraged we haven't had any luck.  Any advice?"
"LDR


I know I might be overreacting or insecure. But this problem has been bothering me lately. 

3 years ago I met a girl online. We fell in love. I visited her country and we got engaged. We're going to get married in like a year. So recently, I discovered that she's been texting another guy and she's talking to him daily and she sends him loads of selfies. And she aslo sent him a video of her in bed covered in sheets (nothing inappropriate) giving him a quick update on her day.

So to the girls, is this a normal action, that many of you do?
And to the guys, if you were in my place, how would you react?

And I know I might be overreacting, so please take it easy."
"Do I need to tell my boyfriend [27M] that I [28F] am more sexually attracted to women than men?


Hear me out...

We've been dating for a few months, known each other a year, and we pretty serious about building towards a future together.

I identify as bisexual. It doesn't really come up much in my life, because I pass as straight. I've exclusively dated men (that is just the way it has played out, not that I was never open to the idea) but have had hookups long and short term with women. Sometimes there were feelings involved, however nothing really developed from these relations.

The way I see it is that I LOVE men, and I LUST for women. Sex/fantasies/porn with women turns me on drastically more than with men. I mean very much noticably so to the point that I feel the need to reach out here about it. I have very satisfying sex with my boyfriend, because it feels good and he knows how to get the job done. I am attracted to him &amp; find him extremely handsome.

I love him and I see myself marrying a man when I think about my future. Again, I want to emphasize that I love men &amp; that is what I envision when it comes to romance. My boyfriend checks all my boxes for a partner. He is the kindest most honest man I've ever met. We are really, really happy!

He asked me yesterday if he ever needs to worry about me and women. I said ""no"" but in my mind I felt slightly dishonest. I would never cheat on him, but if we are honest I think about sex with women somewhat frequently. We have a very open, communicative relationship and I want to honor that trust we have built.

So, worth mentioning? Let it go? Best approach?

TL;DR: I love my man, but sexually I lean towards attraction to women. Is this a red flag from my end?"
"Am I really overreacting?


My boyfriend (20M) and I (22F) have been going out since September. Everything was great until mid-October when his ex-gf left a note on his car saying she missed him. This didn’t really bother me until they were texting and calling each other a lot, and I caught him texting her that ‘he’s at his friend’s house’ when he was over at my place. Even though we were only going out for a month, we weren’t just anything casual either so it really hurt me when I saw that. When I told him how it hurt my feelings that he said that, he told me it would have hurt her feelings more if he had told her. This made me really upset, to the point that it’s something that I think about often. 

Anyway, yesterday I was upset over something and I wasn’t telling him why (this is something that I do a lot now). He seemed upset that I wasn’t telling him anything so I told him that it wouldn’t matter if I told him or not because he wouldn’t really care why I was upset. I brought up that story about his ex-gf and how the fact that he never acknowledged that what he said was hurtful, and that he never apologized. In fact, he still believes that he did the right thing. I also explained that because he never did that, it’s still something thats hurtful to me now, months later. He got upset and said that I’m trying to start sh*t with him by bringing up old things, which made me upset because he wasn’t listening to what I was saying. He barely apologized and was like ‘well i’m sorry then’ and I just went to bed afterwards. 

This morning, I began thinking maybe I was petty for bringing up something that happened months ago. However, it is something that hurts me and the fact that he doesn’t acknowledge that it’s hurtful only makes me feel worse. What do you guys think? Should I just leave it in the past? I’m so confused what to think. 

TL;DR: My boyfriend did something in the past that hurt me, and he’s upset that I keep bringing it up.

"My husband [32M] has been growing a beard. I [30F] hate it.


My husband and I have been together for 8 years and married for 4.  He's always had some facial hair (a goatee or light beard), but this winter has decided to grow a full beard.

He seems to be happy with the progress and keeps it neat for the most part....But I don't like it.  

It's like the bigger beard has changed how his face looks.  I think he's still attractive, but not as attractive as I found him with shorter facial hair.  However, his guy friends are all impressed with it and some of his female friends have commented how it makes him look more masculine, so I guess it's just me that is turned off about it. 

I was going to try and bring up something to him, but am hesitating since, a few years ago, I got a large tattoo on my back that he wasn't that thrilled about. However, he never tried to stop me.  He just expressed that he didn't find large tattoos like that attractive, but that it was my body so it was ultimately my choice. So I went ahead and got it and he's never said anything about it since (other than to compliment the work).  

So I kind of feel like I'm not really able to say anything with out being slightly hypocritical. At the same time, I'm not finding him that attractive and I am unsure if I'll be able to move past it.  While the tattoo on my back is only seen when I'm not wearing a shirt, I have to see his face ALL THE TIME. 

What do I do?  Can I say something? If I did, how should I phrase it without sounding like a hypocrite? 

TL;DR: My husband grew a nice beard, but I hate it.  He didn't make a fuss when I got a tattoo that he didn't find attractive, so I'm unsure if I can say anything without sounding like a hypocrite. Advice?"

"I (26f) have a higher sex drive than my wife (24f) and it’s starting to get to me


I am totally and completely in love with my wife. She is the woman of my dreams and our love started out like a shot, with equal emotional and physical intensity. I’ve always had a high sex drive ever since I could remember and for a long time, my wife met me right there in terms of sexual reciprocity. She seemed to want it just as much as I did, and our sexual life was never wanting. This was new for me and I remember thinking “Wow! I’ve finally found the perfect sexual partner! I’ve never been more satisfied” We were  having sex at least multiple times a week, sometimes multiple times a day.

A little after a year into our relationship, we went through our first dry spell. I have a history of an eating disorder and I definitely have some body image issues - She and I had just gotten married and I had gained some weight, so I was worried that it was due to that. She more than assuaged my fears about it being about me physically and told me it was only about her natural sex drive; I had heard a few things from her during our relationship that our sex was the best she’d had, and that her desire for it was more intense than ever before, but I hadn’t connected that with the potential that our sex life could die down for us one day. 

Ever since that first dry spell, we’ve been in this pattern that makes me so sad. She’s so affectionate and warm and loving and caring, but the minute I suggest sex there’s seemingly always a reason to decline or “I totally want to but maybe in a little while for &lt;insert reason&gt;” but then it inevitably gets too late/her desire for it is gone/she already took her nighttime meds that make her sleepy. Eventually it’s been weeks and weeks since the last time we had sex and I’ve been rejected so many times that I can’t even count, and then she’ll seemingly realizes how long it’s been and then ask me how I’m feeling about it or express to me how she knows it’s been “too long” and she’ll make a concerted effort to re-engage in a sexual life with me. Then, once we do have sex again, the process repeats.

I don’t take it personally. I know she loves me endlessly. But I literally cannot understand why things have to be so hard for us when it used to be so good for so long. It’s been like this for a year and a half now. She’s brought it up on her own a few times and expressed how she wishes she had more of a sex drive, but any suggestions I offer to her own musings about why her sex drive is low doesn’t happen. For example, she told me she thought that maybe our weekly routine just made it hard for her to feel in the mood. We agreed to try to do more new things together and go on more dates. You know how many dates we’ve been on since that convo, despite multiple suggestions and offers on my part? Zero. How many months ago was that? Four. I’m so confused about why she offers up explanations and desires to change, yet no effort happens. 

What do I do? Has anyone else been through this? Does this seem like normal long term relationship stuff or does this seem like a bad sign? I keep being very gentle and non-blame oriented when we talk about it, but does that mean I’m basically signing up for only having sex with my wife once a month (if that!) for the rest of our lives?? 

Also, just so everyone knows, we’re in a non-monogamous relationship. We’ve been Polyam for as long as our relationship has been going on and had sex with people apart and together. I totally have absolute permission to have sex with others if I wanted, but this isn’t about sex itself or needing release. This is about how much I love having sex with my wife, yet she doesn’t seem to want to have sex as much with me (or anyone, for that matter). 

TL;DR My sexual relationship with my wife started out amazingly and has since almost ground to a halt due to how low her sex drive is. She states on her own accord that she wants to change this but doesn’t put in any tangible effort. I feel conflicted about whether or not I should resign myself or try to push for change. I’d like to know if anyone else has experience with this in their relationship or marriage"
"My ex [27M] blocked me [26F] then now he texted me again! Is he back?



My ex [27M] and I [26F] broke up in November. We were together for a little bit of a year. He had drug problem and he wanted to focus on himself and recover. I helped him through detoxification time and I stuck by his side then when he got better he broke up with me. We stopped having sex before that because he was having problems during his addition. Anyways, he wanted to remain friends after the breakup even though he’s the one who wanted to breakup with me. He kept texting me like every few days after the breakup and I was okay with it because I still loved him and was kinda confused and not sure how to react we even hung out three times after that. Anyways, after the last time we hung out he didn’t want to hangout with me as friends because I made a comment about him paying for the meal because he shared it with me and I said “we are not a couple, pay half of the bill” and he paid and was kinda shocked! So we didn’t hangout but he kept texting every now and then. By mid December he called me and was asking me how I’m doing and he was telling me about his family and that he was moving to a new place and everything was normal then he wanted to ask me out to hangout then he said never mind. I ignored it and didn’t say anything on the phone. That night I texted him back asking him not to call me again and that the way he talks to me is very disrespectful. He texted me few hours after saying he’ll leave me alone and he just didn’t mean to be an asshole or make me feel that way. Then he went ahead and blocked me on Instagram and deleted me off Snapchat and blocked my number. It was s shocking to me that he could just do that in a second and just cut me off like he wanted me to say that to him so he can delete me out of his life ( I was offended because he still has his ex gf on his Instagram account even though he didn’t like her) so I told myself that I have to move on and not think about him and just try my hardest not to chase him or waste more time on him. Once I felt like I was moving on and kinda met someone I felt deeply for my ex decided to text me last weekend and wish me happy new year and he told me that he wanted to send me that on New Year’s Eve but he held back till last weekend. And then he told me he’s here for me. 
So my question is what is my ex trying to do? 
Why is he back even though he blocked me and overacted? 
I’m so confused by his actions and would love an outside perspective 

Thank you 

TL;DR: ex texted me after blocking me and saying that he’ll leave me alone be out of my life and now I don’t know what to think "

"My (31M) GF (27F) has massive insecurity issues which are destroying our relationship


On mobile so sorry about formatting and all that.

Been with my GF for about 6 months. Generally we get along great and she makes me very happy most of the time. 

One major issue we're having is her insecurity. Every argument/disagreement we've had stems from that.

She does not trust me around other women...at all. She once referred to me as a ""heartbreaker"" even though I've never cheated on any GF I've been with ever...emotionally or physically. I am very much a monogamous and faithful person. And I've only had a small number of relationships. But she doesn't want me talking to or being friendly with any other women. She even got upset with me for liking a female acquaintance's FB profile pic...months before I even met her. (Apparently she had been snooping all the females on my friends list.)

I'm an avid hiker and outdoor photographer. I have tens of thousands of nature photos on my social media pages. My GF apparently went through ALL of them and found a few which had my most recent ex in them (or, ""tons"" as she said at the time). They weren't selfies or romantic type pics...just scenery shots with my ex kinda far away and off to the side. Anyway, this caused a week-long fight where I was accused of still carrying a flame for my ex. I honestly didn't even know the pics were still up...I just have so many to go through that I lost track. My stress over it went through the roof. I actually had to take a day off work to mentally decompress.

A little later after that incident a girl I had hiked with in a group BEFORE I met my GF reached out to me and asked if I wanted to go hiking again. She was someone I definitely liked as a FRIEND, but knowing my GF's insecurity I declined. As a matter of openness, I mentioned the invitation to my GF. Big mistake. This started another long fight where she said I enjoyed being chased by other women and must want to have sex with the girl I went hiking with. I told her I had absolutely no romantic interest in her and hadn't even talked to her for close to a year. My GF then said that she didn't believe for a second that we haven't already slept together.

Things eventually simmered down but she still brings up the ""other women"" that are apparently chasing me all the time. And she insinuates that the hiking community is just a pretense for hooking up. Pretty outrageous since I mostly hike solo or with other dudes. And I fucking LOVE hiking for hiking. If my phone is laid face down she says I must be hiding something. Spoiler: I hardly talk to anybody besides a couple male friends.

So there it is. I love this woman and there's so much that's great about her but the insecurity stuff is getting to be a bit much. I have tons of character flaws but I am not a cheater or a liar, and the contant implication that I am both is frankly offensive. Is this worth saving? Can I fix this?

TL;DR - GF of 6 months thinks I'm chasing or being chased by women all the time. Won't let me talk to or be friends with any females. Freaks out if I even like a picture with a woman in it. If I literally look in the direction of another woman (not intending to even look at said woman) I get snapped at.

"Meeting my long distance [27F] GF's Taiwanese parents for the first time but her dad does not want her to date [25M] me. What do I do?


I'm half Asian half Canadian and my GF is Taiwanese. I will be celebrating Chinese New Year with her family and it is also the first time meeting them. I looked into it more on so I can respect the cultural expectations so I could act accordingly and respectfully as they are welcoming me to their home (I get to stay there with them for the whole trip). I realized that CNY is a pretty big celebration for them (kinda like our Christmas in North America). 

&amp;#x200B;

So her parents are a bit on the traditional side. Her mom is a bit open to her dating a foreigner but still iffy about it. Now, the worst part is that her dad is a bit adamant of her not dating a foreigner. They'd want her to be with a local guy instead. 

Anyways, they speak very little English and I am trying my best to learn basic Chinese so I can at least show them how serious I am with entering their family. I talked to my GF about it but he has always been closed off with the topic or would just ignore it if she brings it up. 

&amp;#x200B;

Now, as for my status in life, I'm pretty confident that there will be no issues for them to see me as a bad person (maybe my full sleeve tattoo) but I am well educated and has a really good career. I know sort of some expectations as my mom is full on Asian. 

&amp;#x200B;

Lost on what to do and I just don't want to screw up the first meeting with my GF's parents. What should I do or steps should I take to get her father's approval?

"Dealing with insecurities


I’m (24m) head over heels with this girl(23f) I met a few months ago but don’t live near. I recently visited the area she is in and took the opportunity to hang out with her. I had previously let my intentions known and was told she is not wanting to date months before the visit. I backed down and maintained the friendship because it is important to me to stay friends. (I had not yet fallen for her)

When I visited though was when it clicked how deep in I was. She was very obviously flirting and so was I. But when I made a move thinking she was ready she apologized and told me she wants to but just is not ready due to mental health.  She told me that we can revisit it at a later time and if she is ready and we are both still interested then we can give it a try.

I have no problem with her wanting to wait since we live far apart and it is important she work on herself so she can be happy. But I have serious insecurities when it comes to waiting for people as I have been led on a lot . I have already decided I’m going to date others in the meantime because I can’t put everything on hold for her, it is a mistake I’ve made in the past.

How do people overcome their insecurities regarding this sort of situation?

TL;DR She is not ready but interested, I am falling for her pretty hard but want any future relationship with her to be healthy. I have insecurities about being led on  (although I believe that is not what is happening here) and do not know how to deal with them so I am looking for advice on dealing with that."
"Dealing with an openly verbally abusive relationship between uncle and grandma


Since I (25F) was little, my uncle has had rage issues, and 95% of the time his tantrums have been directed at my grandmother. For example, once my grandmother cooked dinner for us and she made seafood spaghetti. Instantly my uncle started yelling how she’s a “stupid pig” and how she should know that he can’t eat mussels because they remind him of his food poisoning. And she just sits there and apologizes. The problem is (besides doing it in the first place), once he starts, he just doesn’t stop. He continues until she finally snaps and starts tearing up and says “I’m just trying my best!”. It’s utterly heartbreaking.

Most recently he did this while we were playing a card game with my grandmother, my cousin (from another uncle) and her boyfriend, and my boyfriend and I. My grandma was playing perhaps in a not-so-smart manner, but she’s 82 and anyone can tell that she’s becoming quite forgetful, it’s totally normal. But no, my uncle had to start yelling about how “stupid” she is, that she “has no brain”, etc. It was so sickening to watch, and we tried to change the conversation, but he’d just talk over us and continue yelling. It got to the point where my cousin’s boyfriend put his hand in front of him and said “enough”. My grandma obviously was upset.

When I approached her later, after everyone left, I told her that this wasn’t okay. She gave me the same response she’s been giving me for years, “Your uncle is a really good person, he has the kindest heart in the world and he’s always here when I need help. No matter what I need, he’s always here to help me, he’s the only one”. 

It’s completely true. My cousin is studying and working, her father is in another city, my parents live in another country, and I live in yet another country as well. My grandpa passed away a few years ago, so she’s living alone. My uncle comes by almost every day to check up on her, makes sure she’s okay, fixes anything that needs fixing, and keeps her company. But the verbal abuse and aggression is awful, and I don’t know what to do. I can’t bear it anymore (or ever).

I have stepped in when it happens as much as I can, but my family speaks German and my German isn’t so advanced that I can keep up with the speed my uncle speaks. My cousin doesn’t speak up because she says it’s no use, which is sort of true. Outside of his tantrums, he’s a fun, trustworthy, loyal person, but when he gets his rage he is a nightmare. 

So redditors, is there anything I can do when this happens that can stop/calm the situation? I mainly want to protect my grandmother, she is the sweetest lady in the world and I adore her. She also has very strong anxiety and that’s why I think she doesn’t speak up for herself. I want to say/do something that stops my uncle from just continuing with the yelling - I can see that he can’t stop and struggles to. I’m sure his rage moments don’t make him feel good either, and I seriously think he needs therapy. Sadly he is one of those people that thinks therapy is bull.

"I (26M) just ended things with my (27F) girlfriend; I'm questioning everything.


So I just ended things with my now ex girlfriend last night, and I'm seriously unsure on how I feel regarding this. I know this might be not something I should admit, but here I am. 

&amp;#x200B;

So we were dating for near 4 months now, and just recently came back from a nice little trip. The trip went well, although we had a few arguments here and there. I guess since we got back, I began kind of distancing myself, and last night I finally just broke things off. I think she's a really amazing, strong person, incredibly kind, and gorgeous. I just don't know what it was. Sometimes it didn't feel right, and other times it felt great. I don't know why, I can't figure it out. 

&amp;#x200B;

I think I should probably include some context in regards to me, as this is where the issue really falls down I believe. 

* I'd consider myself pretty emotionally unintelligent in regards to my own self awareness.
* I know I'm an \~alright communicator when I need to be, but I sometimes withhold because I don't want to create conflict (I'm aware this is bad, I'm actively working on it)
* I guess I also have this ""fantasy"" of how my life looks, and while it's not incredibly far off, I'm not all that sure where she fit into it, or if she would hold me back. 
* I'm terrified of having my heart broken, due to a pretty bad past experience, so maybe I'm just pushing her away. 
* I'm also scheduled to move to another university in September, about 10 hours away from here. We've talked about her coming with me, but the level of commitment so early scares the shit out of me. 
* I'm super adventurous, and an adrenaline junkie. I try new things, even if I may not like them, and rarely panic in bad situations. I need an adventure buddy.

I guess a lot of things like getting her to try snowboarding or skiing, or becoming and active outdoors runner (we run in -20 through winter), or backcountry cross country skiing, running marathons/trail running, surfing, or outdoors climbing. Many of these things she holds no interest in, but manages to keep herself entertained while I do them. I'm just unsure if I want a partner to sit on the sidelines while I enjoy these things, I want to share these experiences, and revel in them. I want to share the passions I have with my partner. 

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR I guess I feel like I'm being really selfish by leaving such a great person for wanting to sit these experiences out. I'm nervous being 26, even family wise we wanted very similar stuff. I just don't know how I feel anymore, I miss her, I want to be with her, but I feel plenty of concern in regards to these things. Any insight is appreciated. "
"Friend-zoned a Co-Worker


A new guy in my office and I recently started talking about some common interests we share, we started emailing back and forth every once in awhile too (small talk, things like our workloads, how the week was going ect).

A few days ago- he sent me 25(f) a FB message stating how he found me interesting and attractive, and asking to ""get to know me better"" I told him I was flattered, but due to school, and work, and a lot of other activities I thought it would be best we just stay friends. He said he respected my choice. We're both fairly new and he's one of the only people I talk with at work. Given the fact that he likes me- is it best I quit talking to him?

I don't want to unintentionally lead him on, yet it also sucks to not have someone to talk to every once in a while at work (in a strictly platonic way)

TLDR; Friend-zoned a co-worker. Is it best to just stop talking aside from when we have to interact for work related issues?"

"I [25f] don't know how to help my mom [51f] who has become insufferable and is pushing people away since my stepdad [52m] passed away 1.5 years ago.


Hi guys. You probably won't remember, but I had a post here that got quite a lot of attention when we were given the news that my stepdad had an aggressive form of cancer and had only 6 or so months to live. This all happened within months of my mom finally beating her breast cancer and being deemed cancer-free. It was a horrible time and after almost a year, he passed away.

&amp;#x200B;

While my mom was married to George, he generally provided for her everything she needed. They weren't overly rich or going on lavish vacations, but she didn't have to work and she could go out to eat whenever she wanted, buy whatever she needed whenever she needed it, and they had nice cars and even a cute little pontoon boat for a while. She wasn't buying expensive clothes or jewelry, or becoming a member of a yacht club and eating at fancy restaurants, but she was very comfortable. 

&amp;#x200B;

Since George has passed away, my mom has understandably been very upset, but as time goes on, I'm at a loss of how to help her. She is struggling because she's not used to managing her money, to budgeting, or to having to work to earn a living. She had to move into a smaller house and she, obviously, really misses George. 

&amp;#x200B;

However... she has become very hard to be around. She's very mean to my 18 year old brother (who still will live with her until he graduates highschool in May). Although he's not the best behaved kid by any stretch, he doesn't have any major issues like drinking or partying or sneaking girls home. He's just a bit lazy, sometimes will lie to try and get himself out of being in trouble, and doesn't try hard at all in school. I feel bad for him though because my mom is pretty vicious with him, insulting him pretty regularly and becoming irate with him when he forgets a chore. To a point where she screams at him loudly and will call him an idiot.

&amp;#x200B;

She's also done this with me when  I've been home visiting. I live far away now but there are times where she will target me with her anger, imply that I hate her or don't respect her even though when I'm around I'm always very kind and always help her in any way that I can without complaining. She can be very manipulative in trying to make me feel bad for things that I'm not even doing. 

&amp;#x200B;

Beyond that, I want to be able to gently help her understand that there are still good things in her life that could bring her some joy or comfort. That she should be happy that she has a son at home still who loves her, even if he messes up a lot. Instead, she says she's 'sick of him"" and can't wait for him to get out of the house. She also will complain that there is no one in her life who cares about her since George died. This is hard to hear because of course my brother and I care about her very much, but she also has maybe 5 or 6 VERY close friends who would do absolutely anything for her and are always around to help her. She also has a huge social circle of people who will help her here and there, or who are available to keep her company. She has way more caring friends and general acquaintances than I do. More than almost anyone I know. It's hard to have even a handful of people who truly, deeply care about you, but she chooses to believe that no one cares and that she is all alone. 

&amp;#x200B;

She also tries to keep herself busy now with work and then unpaid activities like scoring sports games for my brother's school, which is understandable, but then she complains that she has no time for anything she enjoys. I try to suggest that she stop scoring games and focus on things that she enjoys, but she won't listen.

&amp;#x200B;

I have no idea what to do. I feel so bad for my mom because I know this must be so hard for her in so many ways, but she's so negative and angry and mean, sometimes even directly to me for no reason. How can I help her reclaim her life and be happy? I'm far away from her at the moment but I just don't know how to help her feel better. I feel bad for her, I feel bad for my brother, and I just want something positive to come out of this so my mom can begin to enjoy her life again. She has a very happy and bubbly and energetic side to her personality that she still shows other people in public, but at home she's a very different person. I want a better life for her. I also fear that she is destroying her finances because I've witnessed her still making large purchases on a whim despite her very minimal income. I can only hope that she's lying about how much money she has for sympathy, but is actually receiving benefits from George passing away that are supporting her spending.

&amp;#x200B;

I don't have the money to afford most things I would like to do, like take her on a trip somewhere, or take her to some sort of Tony Robbins style seminar. 

&amp;#x200B;

\*\*tl;dr\*\* My mom has become negative and angry since my stepdad passed away and I don't know how to help her improve her happiness."

"Me [35 F] with my SO [31 F] 5y, had a disagreement over fixing her car


So the situation is basically that we have put ourselves on a strict budget to pay down my student loan debt. We've had quite a few costs come up such as home repairs, car repairs, medical stuff, etc. over the last few months. Tonight we were doing our budget and we have maxed out our budget for repairs and medical expenses for this month because I needed some dental work done. Money is tight this month but we settled the budget and all seemed good. 


Then she brought up how her car that we just spent $1000 on fixing a leak last month (in addition to holiday travel and expenses) is now making a sound that she wants to get checked out. The thing is that her car is a never-ending stream of expenses. Many repairs have been necessary like her A/C. The leak that was fixed last month was described as ""not that bad"" and only costed so much because it required completely replacing another costly part. She probably could have gotten by just checking her power steering fluid regularly while we saved up money to do the repair. However, she gets really demanding and pushy about her car and didn't want to wait. To the point where we have repeatedly prioritized services on her car to the detriment of mine. 


To be fair there are other circumstances here. Her parents are both sick and she doesn't want to drive her car up there if there is something wrong with the engine. I do understand that, it's just that I'm not sure what we can do about it. We don't have another $1000 to throw at her car this month. To top it off, the plan has been for a couple of months now that we would get the leak on her car fixed and then address the issues with mine. Currently, my car is also making a strange engine noise and at least 2 of the tires have slow leaks. I'm also due for a major service. Tonight when she brought up wanting to get her car serviced to find out what the noise was I mentioned that I too really need to get a service on mine and reminded her of what we discussed. 


She got really defensive and kept saying things like ""I don't know why you didn't already take your car in!"" Which felt odd considering that we *just* finished looking at our budget and resigning ourselves to basically eating rice and beans till the end of the month. There is no money to service either car. At least not until next month when our budget resets. She said she would just take the money out of her credit card payment or just put it on her credit card. Considering that we are trying to pull ourselves out of debt I expressed I thought that wasn't a good idea but she should do what felt right to her. I know she is worried about her family and I do want her to be able to see them. I feel like sometimes she can be very selfish and unfair to me though. If anything happens with her car she expects it to be fixed immediately. I've been waiting months to have mine looked at. Same with my dental work. I put it off for over a year. 


I offered that maybe we could take money out of another budget category instead of reducing her credit card payment. She seemed agreeable but then I explained if the mechanic found a problem then we still needed to wait to fix it. She seemed frustrated with this. I truly don't know what she wants. Like, we don't have any more money. What I proposed would get her the opportunity to find out if the car was safe to drive and potentially would allow her to go see her family. If it turns out that her car needs even more repairs I said we would have to come up with a plan if that happened. She didn't say much after that and then left the room a short time later. I think she's upset about hearing ""no"" and I feel frustrated that when she doesn't get what she wants she gets upset like this.

She said she is not happy with our financial situation, which I agree, the budget has been tough and I am currently trying to get out of my field and into a better paying one. The thing is we can't get anywhere in terms of paying off debt if we don't stay disciplined and it feels like I'm the only one who cares about that. The worst case scenario is that she would have to wait 2 weeks to see her parents until we could afford the repair (setting aside my car repairs once again...). I don't know if that's unreasonable. Her parents have health problems but nothing is acutely wrong at this moment. If there is something wrong with her car I think the only option would be to use the credit card to get it repaired if she is unwilling to wait 2 weeks. 

TLDR: SO might need car repairs and we don't have money to address them for 2 weeks. My car also needs repairs that have been put off multiple times now in order to address her car problems. I feel really frustrated that we prioritize her needs repeatedly and it never seems to be good enough. I also feel bad for putting any barriers up around her seeing her parents because they are having health problems and she worries about them. Then again, I can't control the fact that we don't have money for an expensive car repair though it feels like she is still blaming me for that. I need help sorting out these emotions because I feel confused. "

"How do I [28 F] make it through a family member's wedding in the same town my ex and I vacationed in?


First time posting on this sub so please be easy on me here. My situation is, I'm a 28 year old female and I've always had horrible luck with getting dates/relationships. I've only ever been in 1 serious relationship and that lasted only about a year. During that year we took a week vacation together to a nice vacation town about an hour from us...and that was the first, last and only vacation I've ever been on with a guy/boyfriend and even though that was about 8 years ago, I've never been back to that town since. A few months after that, we broke up amicably because we realized we had a number of different things that made us not compatible. 

So fast forward to now and I am invited with my parents to a family member's wedding in that same vacation town. I honestly don't know how I can handle this, because every time I even think about that town I think of my ex and get emotional and sad...so I don't know how I can actually be in that town without breaking down crying. I miss that time we shared and that one vacation we had together and I never planned on going back to that town because I knew it would cause me heartbreak with all the memories rushing back. 

I honestly don't even want to go, but as it's a close family member getting married, I know I'm expected to be there. And the fact that it is 2 love birds getting married will make it 100% worse for me. As if that wasn't bad enough, a small group (including me and my parents) are invited to a nice restaurant in town the day before the wedding...and it is the exact same restaurant I went to with my ex when we were on vacation there. 

Any advice on what to do? I know if I go I'm going to be heart broken the entire time and I don't want to spend the whole time crying, but I'm not sure what I can do. 

TL;DR: Invited to a family member's wedding, which happens to be in the same town I went on my first, last and only vacation with an ex many years ago and I know I'm going to be heartbroken being there. "

"Boyfriend upset because we can't find anything to gift me.


Hi!
I guessed this was my best community where to ask.
So, my birthday is coming next month and my boyfriend wants to gift me something. We agreed on a ring.
Now, I have very precise tastes. It's difficult to find something that 100% pleases me in the market and every ring I see (to me) is the exact same of other 20.000 I saw. They feel like they don't have any personality, the usual band with a little diamond/stone in the center and blah blah.
I don't like ordinary stuff. I don't want something that I don't love to the fullest, if I can choose it with him (what we agreed on).

OF COURSE if he happened to gift me something I wouldn't love, I would still thank him, accept it and wear it. I'm not an hypocrite. But since we agreed on finding it together, he's upset that I don't like anything we see.

I like something legit I saw online, but I get and respect the fact that he doesn't trust to buy something really expensive online. And it's okay.

Am I being unreasonable? He said that my tastes are ""strange"" just because they aren't like everyone else's.

I don't see a problem here, but he's a bit sad.

**TL;DR** gift for my birthday. My tastes are precise and anything in shops isn't of my liking, I find them (rings) meaningless and all the same. Boyfriend says my tastes are strange and now is upset because he wanted to gift me something really badly."

"Husband refuses to take any imitative for his health it scares me


 

Hello my husband (42) has always refused to go to the gym or do any physical activity at all. He has always been a thin man 6' 135-140lbs he has never been a big eater maybe 1 or 2 meals a day.

Its not about him getting bigger,, I would like him to be healthy and to keep his body in moving for when we get older and all the obvious reasons that I just can not get him to listen to. It would be nice if he could gain some size I am not going to lie to see him a little more in shape would be a huge turn-on, but even that does not seem to motivate him. Any time I try to encourage it, he counter points with something negative ""working out is for people who are fat."" or ""why work out if he cant gain muscle"" and every other excuse under the sun.

Just stuck here and don't want to fight or be naggy, but I am afraid that he is not going to be with me when I grow old and I don't want to be with out him and want him around.

"How do I (22M) get over crush (20F)


Hey,

I have a crush on a friend and I don't know what to do about it. I've known her for about a year; we ""bonded"" through a group of friends at school. I don't want to tell her because of how awkward it will be afterwards since she only sees me as a friend. I say this due to the fact that she quickly dismissed the idea of us being together when a friend brought it up. On the other hand keeping it a secret is causing me a lot of pain. Since I'm overthinking everything she does or say and just jealous tbh. I had put some distance between us by ignoring her in order to make the feelings go away which was working until a common friend asked me to make up with her (w/o knowing why I was ignoring her) I eventually did. So back to square one...

I feel like my options now are, tell her and make things super duper awkward or suffer in silence. What would seem like the best case scenario is I tell her and it turns out to be mutual (lol) however that's also not good cause I'd have to then start going out with her and I'm just the worst when it comes to relationships, boring, no ambition, broke... just nothing a girl would want, so I'd just be wasting her time. Seems like a childish situation but sadly that's where I'm at.

TL;DR I want to stop liking a crush"
"My [23/F] Boyfriend [26/M] broke up with me out the blue


Hi guys,

So the situation is kind of unique. I started dating this guy in October after he introduced me to his friends (work and school) as well as his sister. We went on amazing vacations; Colombia, Aruba, Miami and New York. It was long distance but we were both optimistic. We spent New Years together and he wrote me a note telling me how excited he was about our future. He told his parents about me and wanted me to meet them but I couldn’t afford that trip. His Christmas gift to me was a ticket to see him in South Korea when he’s going to be working there for 8 months. I got him a bunch of gifts and he sent a picture of them all to his mom. He also wanted to talk to my dad (and I never introduce anyone to my parents) 

My ex boyfriend committed suicide in November and I saw him three days before he did it. I felt very guilty and honestly I cried everyday. For two weeks I talked to the new guy about it but stopped because I knew it wouldn’t eventually take a toll but I held in all the feelings and dealt with it myself. 

On vacation the new guy did a lot of Coke and in the beginning of our relationship he briefly mentioned he had a coke problem. I noticed he did it a lot more after our vacation while he was in Colombia. I reminded him that his New Years resolution was to cut back but he was doing it every night for the past five days. He told me he had a plan to do it once every three months. I told him I just was worried and wanted him to be safe. He sent me a job application for a place in Asia and told me I should apply- this hinted that he wanted me close. I applied and thought nothing of it. Our messages were shorter and shorter and I assumed it’s because he was going out all night and sleeping all day. I trust him so I didn’t say anything but I was just worried about the coke. A few days later he randomly messages saying we should talk. I agreed but he was waiting to call me, I told him we should just get over with it and talk now. 

He told me that he didn’t feel comfortable sharing things with me and didn’t feel comfortable being vulnerable around me. He said our relationship looked great on the surface but it never developed deeper. He even mentioned it was like this with his past girlfriends. He said it was him and not me and he needed time to figure out what type of role he wants to play in a relationship. I was annoyed and said okay, it’s your decision and we ended it. 

I called him the day after just to get closure. I wanted to know if it was me and he said it has nothing to do with me and I’m one of the first girlfriends that tried to get him to open up. He just isn’t comfortable opening up with people. I told him that we can eventually get to the point where we open up because we’re only 3 months into the relationship. I even offered to come see him in Colombia to work things out; not just our relationship but because I genuinely concerned about his depression. I asked again if it had to do with me and he said no, then I asked if it had anything to do with the long distance and he said it has nothing to do with it. He said this is the path he needed to take and do it on his own. 

I completely respect his decision but I’m hurt because I’m still grieving over my ex. I get messages from my ex’s friends that I was the root cause of it. I have been dealing with so much and I kept it to myself because I knew it was inappropriate to discuss this with the new guy- I didn’t want to push him away. The day this new guy broke up with me was the morning that my dad went to the hospital and I didn’t even tell the new guy- I didn’t want to burden him with my problems. 

I’m so confused- I just wanted the honest truth but I feel like I got some cop out excuse. I rather him tell me he doesn’t like me or see a future with me but his actions before that tell me otherwise. Can someone explain this to me? I’m devastated and hurt- we had so much fun together and he even agreed. 

He’s also not interested in being friends :( I don’t know if it’s a selfish decision on his part but i was happy with him.

Tl;dr boyfriend broke up with me randomly and out the blue (dude to coke problems and not feeling comfortable sharing with me) but talked about future plans together days before "

"My boyfriend [23] is VERY subconscious about his dick size and I [21] unintentionally made it worse even though I’m perfectly happy with it


We’ve been together for about 4 months, and been friends for much longer than that. He’s really not small, he’s about 5-6inches (so average) but he has said a few times that he wishes it was bigger. He has even said he wanted it to be FOUR inches bigger and I told him that was ridiculous and wouldn’t feel good for either of us.

So anyway, he was asking me about previous partners and he’s good friends with my ex, and knows that my ex was particularly well-endowed. I told him that sex with my ex was actually not great 99% of the time and he only managed to make me finish maybe 4 times in the year and a half we dated. My bf continued asking about previous partners, and also asked “how were they.” At some point I said one guy “was also pretty big.” This struck a nerve, and my bf has literally been upset about this for 24 hours now, to the point where he couldn’t sleep last night and he nearly cried on the phone today (I’m away at college).

I’ve apologized numerous times and reassured him constantly, truthfully telling him I’m very happy with his size and that sex with him is by far better than sex with anyone else. We’ve had shorter, less problematic conversations about this in the past and I always make sure he knows I’m beyond content with the way he is (I even told him I’m welcome to dick pics if he ever wants to send them). It has never been this bad. 

At this point I don’t know what else to say to him. Is this something he just has to come to terms with or is there anything else I should do/say? I won’t be able to see him in person until Friday.

"Our (25F &amp; 35M) building manager (30s?M) is slowly driving us insane.


**tl;dr:** Partner and I moved into a new apartment, but our building manager throws extremely loud parties well past the agreed-upon quiet hours and we have no idea how to confront him about this.

&amp;#x200B;

Okay, this is kind of a weird one. Last October, my partner (35M) and I (25F) moved into a new apartment together, which we love. We've almost finished decorating, and it checks all of our boxes as far as what we were looking for in an apartment. The only thing that's kind of ruining it for us is a noisy neighbor - not a super uncommon problem, I know.

The issue is that the neighbor in question is our building manager, and he frequently hosts extremely loud parties that last until 1:00 in the morning, both on weekends and weekdays even though the lease agreement we signed clearly states that quiet hours start at 10:00. I'm talking music so loud that our floor is vibrating with the bass, and I can clearly hear the lyrics to the songs he plays. Our apartment faces a courtyard, so when his guests go outside to smoke/talk, everyone in the neighboring apartments can hear their conversations - on a couple of occasions there have been people outside yelling until well past midnight, and I know there are multiple families living here with small children. 

Last weekend I had to take a very difficult technical certification for work, and (surprise, surprise) the night before the certification exam our building manager had another party that went until 1:30 in the morning. I texted him at around 11:30 saying ""hey, sorry to bother you but if that’s your music would you mind turning it down?"" but never received a response and the music went on at the same volume. Tonight, he's having *another* party and I feel like I'm finally at my breaking point. Like, it's a Tuesday. A TUESDAY. 

My partner and I decided to contact the management company, however the only contact information we can find is for our building manager. Is there a way for us to tactfully bring it up to him that he's being seriously inconsiderate and that the noise level from his apartment is making us reconsider living here? Since he's our manager we don't want to be on his bad side, but I don't see how we can just continue to put up with this for the remainder of the time we have in this apartment. "
"Help required. I (26M) have fallen in love with one my friends (23F). She's already in a relationship. What to do next? Is there something I should do?


Hi everyone, I need some advice. Been a long time lurker, I think this is my first actual post. Now I need someone elses point of view.
Some back story, I've known her for 2 years now. She's this likeable woman everyone gets along with, great personality and charisma. I trust her like I trust myself and vice versa. For the past year I've slowly fallen in love with her and I told her everything I feel in December just before we parted ways for the holidays. 
My last relationship ended very badly as I needed 4 years to be able to fall in love again. 
We are talking daily since December, and we've also ""dated"" a couple of times. Most recently being this evening after we both finished work.
We had such a great time, we both smiled so much we thought our face would crack.

Thing is she is in a relationship, and she's conflicted on what to do about all this.
I'm starting to think I ruined our friendship with my selfishness.  She says she likes me more than just a friend and that she needs me. As great as she looks to the other friends in our circle I know she lacks self confidence and also thinks she doesn't deserve to be happy. Also her current relationship seems toxic to me but I can't be impartial about it because of the feelings I have for her and she is aware of it. Tbh I think she spends more time talking to me and taking care of me than with her BF. She said to me that she's a bad gf because of what we are doing. I think she's wrong as the only thing we shared are hugs and actual time we spent together. I really care about her and I only want to see her happy. Even at the cost of a broken heart. 

What to do from here? Should I back out or should I go all in? 

Thanks in advance for your advice and sorry for any mistakes or anything else I might have messed up. As I said first post. "

Im 25M, and i have been dating my girlfriend 26F for almost a year. At first things started VERY fast, but we were on the same page with everything, but as time drew out, things became more and more stressful. Every couple fights, and communication is the most important thing to me; having had several long term (2+) yr relationships, i know that it's important to communicate...

The issue is whenever i try and talk about something, she gets pissed off because what i have said is hurtful, and i don't care about her feelings when i tell her what is upsetting me. For example...

Last weekend, my mother invited us for dinner. my mom and her boyfriend had just gotten back from some trip, and saw a Tarot card reader, and loved it, so her boyfriend got them card sets and were reading our tarot cards for fun. Mine said i had a negative or manipulative force in my life i needed to get rid of to be happy. (This was a death sentence, because the night prior, i had finally cracked and told her that she nit picks me frequently, and i feel like she only sees negative in me). So in the car of course, she asks if she is the negative or manipulative thing. Seeing this is a trap, i deny it, and tell her that we are both working on things, and not to worry about it, and to just enjoy the ride. That wasn't good enough so she asked if she had ever been manipulative. Silly me told her that sometimes her behavior can come off a little manipulative (The breaking up with me we are about to get into).

Of course this lights a nuclear warhead. She goes on a rant about how it's so hurtful that i think she is manipulative, and she doesn't want to be with someone that sees her in that way. Trying to explain that some of her behavior could be seen as manipulative spurred another debate on the definition of manipulative, and since by her definition, she does not force the other person to do something, it's not manipulative. (She finds these loopholes frequently) and again its back to how dare i be so hurtful by telling her i think she can be manipulative.

This is the case with literally every argument. Every time it ends with her breaking up with me, and lately, i've just been so totally dead inside, both from the constant nit picking, and being broken up with that i've just begun accepting it, and leaving. Which starts an even bigger fight because now i don't love her, and i've broken her heart. It's so difficult because in the beginning she was so...nice to me, and respectful, and loving, and i saw so much with her, and i was always so excited to spend time with her... I know she can be so sweet, but i don't know why she's been so mean, and so impossible to communicate with. She blames the fact that she's never been in a relationship, and has been alone for so long, and never had to think about anyone else, but it's been a year.

How can you get someone to see that they are doing damage, without making them feel like you're attacking them, or to make them so hurt, that they don't pay attention to the issue you're trying to bring up??

I don't have any friends... I'm completely alone, and have nobody to talk to for advice. I don't want to ask my mom, because she really likes my gf (She's so affectionate and sweet when we are with other people) and i don't want her opinion to change and make things more difficult to work on...

:( Thanks for reading my rant... im sorry for the book.

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR - Girlfriend spins every argument and can't accept that she does anything wrong.  How can i tell her without being hurtful?"
"My (21F) bf (26M) hates when I drink


Okay so I just turned 21, I’ve never been much of a partier growing up, and I still don’t consider myself one. I go out drinking with friends (and ‘go out’ meaning we hang out in our town with four good bars max, everyone knows everyone and we just hop from one to the next until we call it a night.) every once in awhile, I go overboard and become overintoxicated, which usually results in BF having to take care of me. We’ve been together 3+ years and through that I’ve witnessed his fair share of getting fucked up and needing me to take care of him. In fact, I’ve had to take him to the hospital twice due to this. 

SO since being of drinking age, I’ve been having fun. I’m not overly flirty with men while inebriated, I have a solid group of friends that all look out for each other, and I’m pretty easy to take care of when drunk. 

My BF becomes livid when he thinks I’m drunk. He says I act like a child, that all people revert to being toddlers when drunk, and treats me like a toddler because of it. When I’m fucked up, I usually just need him to buy me food and get me water. That’s it. I don’t make a ridiculous mess of our home, I have never thrown up anywhere but the toilet, and I fall asleep very quick. The next day I’m usually hungover for a large portion of it, so I think a part of his resentment goes into the fact that I’m almost completely useless the next day. 

Anyways, he becomes really condescending. Asking me to do things that he knows I can’t do well while drunk (do the dishes, change the kitty litter, etc)  these things are usually done before I go out already as we do chores in the morning and I know to expect this from him, but he still asks it of me as if to prove a point. 

I’m fed up. He takes away from me having a good time REGULARLY. Even if I’m not planning on drinking, he will passive aggressively say something about it as I’m leaving to go hang out with my friends. 

I would also like to add, he’s had his fair share. He stopped drinking regularly a few years back, as it affects him differently since when he was young. I’ve spent hours cleaning his vomit from our carpets, my favorite pillow and our laundry. I’ve taken care of him while he was drunk, I’ve taken him to the hospital, I’ve done EVERYTHING I feel I should be but he can’t let me have a good time with friends as a newly turned 21 year old. 

I need advice. I don’t know what to do. This isn’t a deal breaker for me, but down the road I can see myself becoming resentful because he’s forced me to not have these good times with friends and family because he doesn’t want to deal with the ‘fall out’ 

Tl;dr bf is mildly hypocritical about my drinking alcohol and going out with friends. What do "

"I'm not sure why my (29F) BF (33M) is still with me because we are no longer having sex


 

Hello- I’m seeking some serious advice/opinions about my current situation in my relationship.

My boyfriend, we will call him Mark, and I have been together going on 4 years now.

The sex life was pretty great the first 2 years. Multiple times a week, never feeling like we HAD to. We wanted to- all the time! The 3rd year, it started dwindling down slowly, but surely. It didn’t go unnoticed, obviously, and I almost entirely took the blame as I was dealing with some serious body issues. I’ve gained some weight over the years, started developing what seemed like awful hormonal mood swings and fell into a serious depression over it and “I’m not in the mood” actually meant “I’m not in the mood to focus and obsess entirely on how I look to you along with all of my insecurities and cry afterwards rather than what we are really trying to accomplish”. I knew it had to have hurt his feelings, so I tried explaining to him that it was not him EVER and that I was just not happy with how I looked, which was a self-confidence issue, and what in the world is less sexy than NO confidence? I told him I would work on myself and my fixation on my looks and self-esteem, but we are now almost into our 4th year together. We BARELY have sex. Actually, it’s a rarity, as embarrassing as it is. Once every 2 months, or so. And I feel like we are now “used to it” which terrifies me. I really love him and I DO FIND HIM ATTRACTIVE. I know this is something that I desperately need to seek help for, but I just don’t know where to start for things like this. It's also very embarrassing to talk about, especially being my age and having this issue.

Before I became a mother, I was extremely sexually active/healthy, as well as when our relationship started. I also want to add that we are generally not a very affectionate couple. We don’t “make out”, hold hands, cuddle, talk sweet to each other, no pet names, and it has been like that from the very beginning. We kiss each other in the morning before work and when we come home. Neither of us grew up around very openly affectionate families. No kissing, cuddling, etc. We just were never around it. I will say, however, that I have always very consistently made it a point to compliment him on everything I can. Telling him he looks handsome, smells good, a shirt I like that he’s wearing, etc. He rarely compliments me. I can remember when we first started dating he told me how cute I was once. ONCE. And then a small handful of times, he has said he liked my lipstick or a shirt I had on. There has even been times where I’ve asked him myself “how do I look?” and he replies… with a fist-bump. I really don’t think in the almost 4 years of dating, he has told me I was pretty or beautiful. I know this isn’t “important” as it is only focusing on looks alone, but I mean, I’m a woman. Women want to hear those things sometimes, right? I feel like maybe this is a possible underlying issue in regards to the cause of my self-confidence when it comes to my body and not wanting intimacy because of it?

Am I overthinking everything entirely and just need to seek help for my possible body dysmorphia/self-esteem issues as it may seem that I am probably just sexually frustrated and I am looking for other excuses?

Thank you if you have gotten this far. This has been on my mind for a while and the thought of appreciate any and all insight and advice. Thanks again!

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR My (29F) 4-year relationship with my BF (33M) is at stake due to my insecurities with my body and possible lack of admiration from his end, and I desperately want to know how to fix this within myself because I do find him attractive and want to get back to where we were in the beginning in regards to our sexual health.

"SO broke something and I left without saying bye


So for context, I've been in a relationship with this girl for 5 months, and over these past 5 months, she's started three fires that were put out before any serious damage occurred, stained an expensive chair of mine which I spent close to 300$ on, as a student. All of these were accidents, and she apologized and felt especially bad about the fires, but never did anything about my chair. I was very concerned about the fires, but nothing happened so I didn't get upset at all, but I started to make some ground rules about cooking in the kitchen, which she wasn't following and so I just kept an eye on her when she cooked. I've asked her to be more careful.

&amp;#x200B;

In my apartment I was changing some lights and removed the glass from a ceiling lamp and set it aside on the table. My mom asked me to refrain from putting the glass back by myself until she was there, in case I fell or something, so I left it on the kitchen table.

&amp;#x200B;

This morning, after my SO slept over, we were getting ready in the morning and she grabbed my scarf for me and accidentally knocked over the the glass and broke it. I got really upset because I have no idea how to replace this random glass thing and this is my first apartment so if I ask the landlord how to replace it, I'm thinking he's going to charge me a lot of money and/or give me a bad reference to any future landlord I lease from. I raised my voice and said things like ""I can't believe you've done this"", ""I don't know how to replace this"", etc. She offered to pay for it but I know she can't afford it because she's broke and this landlord could charge a lot of money over this, as I'm not even sure he'd know how to get another glass and he may have to reinstall a whole new unit or something. She offers to clean it up and says that I can go to school without her so I'm not late for class. I leave without saying goodbye because I forgot because I'm in a state of mind where I'm just really upset and trying to figure out what to do. I realize that I forgot to say goodbye, but I leave anyways because I don't really want to go back.

&amp;#x200B;

I go to lecture and afterwards I see that I have two missed calls and text messages like:

* ""Did you actually fucking leave without saying bye?""
* ""You're actually so mean. I feel terrible as is and you decided to do that.
* ""Like what the fuck?""

I was feeling better after lecture and was going to make amends with her, but now she's completely livid that I left without saying goodbye, and says things like I was giving her the silent treatment. She says she's sorry but to me I'm really upset now because it seems like she thinks she can just say sorry, give me money and now I'm supposed to be happy and say ""goodbye, I love you"" or something. She's admitted she thinks she's done nothing wrong because it was an accident, and therefore isn't fully responsible. I'm really upset, and I feel like I didn't act out of line, because I think it's reasonable to get upset when someone breaks something very valuable of yours, although in this case it's not mine, but something I have responsibility for and have to fix. I didn't demean her or demand anything from her, I just left. In her defence, she gets really triggered when someone leaves without resolving an issue because she thinks I am going to leave her, and she's told me so in the past, but I wasn't thinking of that when I did that. She thinks that we're both in the wrong and that I should apologize, but I don't want to because I don't feel like what she did is even close to what I did. 

&amp;#x200B;

What should I do? Am I off base?

&amp;#x200B;

tl;dr: My SO broke something that I don't know how to fix and am responsible for, I got upset and left without saying bye, she got mad that I didn't say bye. She thinks we're both in the wrong, what should I do?"

"My [30F] boyfriend of 7 months has been joking about marriage recently. Is he dropping hints or kidding around?


Posted earlier from the wrong account, if this looks familiar to you. 

I've been dating John for 7 months. I was the one who approached him at a bar and asked him on a date. We didn't realize there was such a huge age gap until we went out with each other, but we hit it off SO well that we just decided to see what happens. 

John has been the one introducing most of the relationship ""milestones"", but I have happily gone along. He asked me to be his girlfriend, introduced me to his friends and family, told me he loved me, etc. I don't know. It seems almost too good to be true. Everything has been really easy. We have lots of fun, we're in love and have not had any issues so far.

So, we've discussed the the future in very casual terms in the past. When he first told me he was divorced, I asked if he was ever interested in getting remarried and he said ""Yes, if I find the right girl"". He asked me if I could see myself living in the USA long-term (I'm on a work visa now) and I said yes. At a niece's birthday party, I asked him if he was done with kids and he said he wanted another if he got the chance. So we know *kind of* where we stand but haven't sat down and had a formal conversation about it.

In the last few weeks, he's been joking about marriage a lot. I don't know if marriage is on his mind, or if he's just kidding. I don't want to bring it up if he's just joking around because that would be awkward. I've made jokes like how he was ""husband material"" and he would just wink and say nothing. But in the last three weeks he's mentioned it like 3 times.

- His daughter [19F] asked me if I was planning to stay it the USA after my visa expired. I said I would like to but it is difficult to immigrate. My boyfriend then joked ""If you can't find a job to sponsor you, you could always find a lucky guy to marry"".

- He went out to lunch with some friends [45M, 38F] and he told me that he had a weird conversation at lunch where [38F] asked for my age (she had seen photos of us on social media and I'm sure he's talked about me). When he told her, she said ""Well, have a bit of fun! It's not like you're going to marry her"". He said he told her that we were happy, and he told me that he felt it was kind of rude for her to assume that he was ""using me"".

- We were drinking and he asked me if I ever worried about being in a relationship with him because I would probably have to watch my husband get old and die. 

- He also made a joke about our kids being smart and beautiful. 

SO. Is he feeling me out, or just kidding? He hasn't initiated any kind of serious conversation and he is usually very straightforward. But there has been a recent uptick in marriage ""jokes"". 

If he wants to talk about the future, I am totally game. I just don't want to bring it up prematurely if I'm just reading too far into what he said. What do you think? Should I say something?

**tl;dr** Boyfriend has been making a lot of marriage jokes recently. Is he putting feelers out or just kidding with me?"

"How do I (33F) discuss my fears about my husband’s (41M) infidelity?


So my husband and I have been married for 4 years. We have a 11 month old daughter. Both of us work full time jobs that are demanding. Of late, my husband’s been very short tempered with me and our sex life has suffered both because of the baby and work. At first I brushed things off and thought it was temporary and things will get better when the baby has a more regular sleep schedule. That was 4-5 months ago. He hasn’t changed, and I sat down with him to ask if everything is ok. He reassured me everything was fine and I let it go.

In the last month, I have noticed that he is home unexpectedly early a lot. We have a part time babysitter (19F) who is here many early evenings to bridge gaps in the early evenings before my husband and I could get him. I have come home on many occasions to find my husband already home. Every single time he is in or walking out of the shower because he got home early and had time to work out because the babysitter is taking care of our child. And her hair is always a little messy from playing with my child, but I never talk to her about it. 

I’m worried they are having an affair behind my back but I don’t want to sound like the crazy paranoid new mom, especially when my husband just reassured me everything is fine. And I guess a big part of me wants this to be untrue because god help me if I have to find another babysitter (moms will understand this). I’ve looked around and read up about secret cams and stuff, but I don’t want to end up being in legal trouble, especially with my well-connected lawyer husband. He has the resources to literally crush me if we got into a legal dispute. 

TL;DR: I suspect my husband is fcking the babysitter behind my back but I don’t know how to ask him about this without sounding like a crazy paranoid mom. "
"Just saw my girlfriends sex tape with her ex today...SHOULD I BREAK UP WITH HER?


Sigh, what a way to start off my first post in reddit.  
Just to warn you guys, this isn't JUST about the sex tape I just discovered 45 minutes ago.

I met my girlfriend when she had recently broken up with her ex and I was her crying shoulder. This happened for a few weeks and then we ended up fucking. Don't get me wrong, I had already started liking this girl and felt like she had some feelings for me too. This happened all too quickly right after her breakup, so I felt like I was taking advantage of her vulnerable state. I reassured her that I was not going to hurt her feelings or even lie to her, I told her I would love her the best I could. She also reassured me that I wasn't just some rebound. She would still miss her ex boyfriend here and there and would talk about him occasionally. This would always piss me off and put me in a bad mood; I told her not to talk about her ex TO me and that I wasn't interested hearing about him. Hearing her talk about her ex hurt my feelings and my ego because I knew how much she loved him and how serious that relationship was for her. She had completely planned a future with him, marrying him, etc etc. I had to deal with this continuously for about 4 months until she finally decided to break ties with him completely. She told me that he had her nudes and videos and I told her it's okay, because that's normal in a relationship. She was glad I was understanding and rang him to ask him to delete those pictures/videos of her. Although I told her, he's just gonna tell you he will but in the end, he won't ACTUALLY delete it. They spoke on the phone and he agreed to delete those pictures and videos of her (doubt that he did). 

&amp;#x200B;

Fast forward a year and a half later, she asked me to transfer her photos and videos from her old phone to her laptop, then transfer those files into her new laptop. She asked me to do it because she was going to be out of town for a few days, hence didn't have the time to do it. I agreed. However, her new laptop had not arrived yet, so I had to transfer all her files to my computer first. It was a long process because she had over 24,000 photos and I had to wait quite a while. As i was waiting, I went on Google chrome and her Facebook was logged in. I have to be honest here, I am a really insecure guy who gets jealous really easily. I did not know this until I got into a relationship with her (probably because I really loved her). I know it was really terrible of me to snoop through her messages but I did it anyway. I read through her messages with her ex boyfriend, and I found out she was still trying to get back with him until that day she asked him to delete her nudes. I also read her messages with her ""guy best friend"", who she claims to be ""nothing more than a friend"". From the things I read, I could definitely tell you that the guy did not see her as a ""friend"". He told her that he loved her and he missed her. She also said love you and I miss you back (bear in mind, she's not the type of person to say those things lightly to just anyone). They were sending each other love hearts and kissing emojis. Two months before I read these messages, she went out of town, and coincidentally, it was the city he lived in, so I KNOW they met up. She also lied to me about NOT meeting up with him cause I could see from the messages and the photos they had met up.

Reading those messages completely broke my heart and it destroyed me mentally, and I was planning to break up with her when she came back. I confronted her about the messages and the first thing she said was ""How could you sneak behind my back and read everything? How low can you get? If you had loved me and respected me, you would have never read my personal conversations behind my back."" Obviously that was wrong of me but that wasn't the main point there! I had showered her with all my love and 100% of my effort and I just got all of that thrown back to my face. Anyway, she denied everything and still insists that he is just a friend. I told her it would be best if we break up and go our separate ways but she cried to me and I just couldn't bring myself to break her heart like that. So we kind of patched things up after two weeks, I pretended everything was okay and I should NOT have. It sucks because I know i will never get over it. I don't know if she cheated on me when she went out of town? I don't know if there are more messages with other guys that I'm unaware of? It sucks that my 100% was never enough for her. Every time we argue, I would always bring up that same issue (the guy friend) and I would just blow up from that. It just infuriates me every single time I think about it. She strayed away from me and started looking elsewhere, I would have preferred if she had broken up with me first, you know?

&amp;#x200B;

Anyway, it's been a few months after all that and recently she told me that she felt disconnected. She felt that I was distant and didn't feel like we were in a relationship. She's noticed that I'm not the same person as before. The way I treat her now is completely different to before and to be entirely honest, I just don't think I love her anymore. I'm a shell of the man I used to be. It just sucks because for the past month, I can see that she has been giving it her all in this relationship. She's never treated me this well yet I am not happy. She constantly texts me yet I just can't be bothered to even open them. Why try NOW? Why not try when I have been trying for the last two years? I spoke to her about this and she told me that she couldn't love me easily because of the things she went through with her ex. That's why it took her so long to trust me and FINALLY love me with all her heart. But meh, I don't buy it. Those words meant nothing to me.   
So today, I was just cleaning up the files on my computer and I have her old files from the time she asked me to move her files. Again, I was curious to see what was there and I saw our pictures. I was just looking through our old pictures and I accidentally came across this old video. This old video was a fucking sex tape of her and her fucking ex. I honestly regret clicking on the folder so much and not remaining in blissful ignorance. I honestly don't know what to do anymore, this situation is so fucked up. Sorry for the long post.

Should I confront her or should I just break it off completely? 

&amp;#x200B;

"I (28M) have trouble being emotionally open with my girlfriend (28F)


I have been dating my girlfriend for 4 years. We have lived together for the last year. Things are going good for the most part. But I have trouble being sincere/romantic. It worries me that I'm unable more emotionally open with her. I know she wants that.

&amp;#x200B;

For example I feel very uncomfortable when we say ""I love you."" If I do anything sweet/nice she says ""Thanks you. Love you"" and wants a kiss. It makes me cringe and not want to do nice things for her. She often points out cute things couples do and mentions how we don't do any of that.

&amp;#x200B;

She has hinted at getting married and I'm not sure that is a good idea. It makes me feel pressure like I should get this sorted out as soon as possible and not keep coasting along in this relationship if it's not sustainable.

"I’m (F21) in an extremely unhappy and toxic relationship with my SO (M24) but spiral into panic attacks at the thought of initiating a breakup.


Hey guys. I hope I get some responses cause I’ve made a post in the past and didn’t. I need help. My SO and I have been involved for about 3 years but have just been in a relationship for 10 months. We met when I was 18 and he was 21. He would tell me he wanted me to be his girlfriend but was just hooking up with me casually, lying and manipulating me into believing those weren’t his intentions. The first time we hooked up he didn’t text or respond to me for weeks, then acted like nothing happened. This cycle lasted 2 years. Which is fucking pitiful. I dated another dude for a month or so within those 2 years but I always yearned for my now, SO. I always told him that I was done and then he’d pop up a couple months down the line and hit me up again normally. And I’d give him a chance when I should’ve told him to fuck off. Well a year ago in January he swore up and down he was sorry for all his games and mistreatment and he wanted his last chance. I was so close to being completely moved on but I did it and he actually stuck to it. We hung out every couple days and he invited me out with his friends and got me gifts on Valentine’s Day, normal relationship stuff. Then 5 months later I caught him sexting with a girl. I broke it off which I was REALLY sure was for good. These few months I knew he was moving across the country to work on a farm for a year so I was happy this shit was finally dying a peaceful death. THEN he cries and begs me to just come on the road trip with him &amp; his friend before he made his final stop and I would get a flight home and that’d be it. That wasn’t it. He cried to me one day and said he wasn’t going to the farm because he wanted to be with me. 

So here we are. 7 months after the road trip. He is extremely needy and clingy, he gets upset when I do things without him, I’ve developed depression, I have no energy or motivation to do any of the things I used to love doing, my friends don’t know how to be there for me anymore, I experience minor dissociation, I feel physically and emotionally exhausted daily, I used to have a great sense of humor and I don’t have the joy to express it anymore, I feel guilty and ashamed of myself every day, and just general hopelessness. He’s just always getting upset with me for something. Like all hell breaks loose if I tell him to slow down a bit in traffic, and I won’t dare ask for some space because he will try to make me feel guilty for days if I do something extreme like that. He’s defensive and emotionally immature. He can’t handle me confronting anything he’s done wrong, he’ll just say “you know you’d do that to me” or bring up something ridiculously unrelated that I’ve done or don’t do. I feel like I’m truly mothering him because he often uses a baby voice and acts like a child. If any of you care about astrology - He’s a Leo. 

The funny thing about this relationship is that I’ve been saying to myself since day 1, “hm, we don’t really have that much in common.” But I’ve still been attracted to him like the fucking snake in the garden of eden!!! He bores me to death and we don’t have the same sense of humor at all. All he talks about is his boring construction job and all he listens to is old country music (which I like...ON OCCASION). He used to be somewhat cooler and dress nicer and listen to good music. I don’t know what happened, and I don’t see why he doesn’t see we’re polar opposites. I broke up with him a few weeks ago over Christmas break and then we got together to move our stuff out and I gave into his tears and remorse and promises to change his annoying behavior. Plus I was having daily panic attacks back home after I ended things. I feel hopeless. I’m terrified of the loneliness and panic attacks. Even living at home I would have panic attacks if my mom left me home alone because of my childhood abandonment and anxiety disorders. 

I’m seeing a therapist in hopes to grow in my emotional strength enough to leave but it terrifies me right now. As well as hurting him/putting him in a bad situation even though I feel the way I do about him &amp; our relationship. I’m terrified of this going on for way too long and me not finding that strength. Anyone ever been in this situation? It’s like I’m a fucking drug addict. I just need some hope. And words of encouragement. 
Thank you guys. 

TL;DR: I’m unhappy with my emotionally immature and energy sucking boyfriend but I feel hopeless about getting out of the relationship. I know it’s unhealthy for me but Im terrified he’ll never let me move on and I’ll be even more depressed and anxious after I leave. "

Recently I started to talk with a girl who lives in other country. I always travel there once in a year. So three weeks ago when I was there we started to talk but I had to come back to my country. She told me that she wants to know me better but talking and sharing with me in person, so she’s like waiting for me. We keep texting like once in a week like hope you are doing good and things like that. She’s usually busy working and studying and me too so we try to text every time we can. Well I just don’t know how to continue I mean I don’t want to get the things bored. Should I just keep texting once in a week or should I text her more often... I want to hear some advices. I know I cannon like do a plan to do the right things but I want to hear some opinions from outside. Thank you guys and sorry for my English. "
"My best friend's sister's boyfriend (20M) has opened up to me (23F) about some stuff and I'm unsure if I should tell my best friend


Hi, sorry, I feel like the title was probably confusing right off the bat so I'm going to go ahead and give everyone names before I go on so people can follow along better.

My best friend (23F) - Isabel

Best friend's sister (19F) - Karen

Karen's boyfriend (20M) - Javier

Okay, so Isabel and I have been best friends since we were 8 years old. Her family is like my second family and Karen has always been like a little sister to me as well. Karen and Javier have been together about 2 years now. Now, about 6 months ago my job was looking to hire some new people and Javier had just decided he wasn't going back to school so I knew he was looking for a job. I told him about it and long story short, he's been my co-worker since then.

To give a little more background, Javier is extremely close with Isabel and Karen's family. Their parents loved him from day one, as do the younger siblings. He even calls the parents mom and dad, he's basically another son to them.

So recently Javier's been telling me more and more about his life, including his relationship with Karen. So, before they met Javier used to party a lot and go out with friends. You know, normal teenage stuff. Karen is not like that at all. She is definitely more of a family person, would rather stay home and watch a movie, etc. She has her small group of friends she hangs out with occasionally (that's how she met Javier) but besides that the party life was never really her scene. Javier gave all that up when he started dating her and he's been telling me how much he misses it. Every time I see him at work after the weekend (if I didn't see him over the weekend) he asks me what parties I went to or bars, clubs, etc. and how he wishes he could do that.

On top of that, apparently Karen and him fight a lot. He's showed me some text conversations at work and she gets pretty mean sometimes though I won't go into specifics on that. She's logged onto his instagram account so she can see his messages and he has to have his location on so she can see where he is. If he doesn't answer the phone right away, she immediately demands to know who he was talking to that was more important.

Now, Isabel has always told me how insecure Karen is and I've seen it myself but now I'm afraid she's going to end up pushing Javier away because of these issues. Javier looks more and more tired of it each week. It's getting to the point where I don't even want him to tell me anything anymore because I just don't know what to say. Oh, I feel it's important to add that I don't actually say much when he tells me these stories, I just let him vent. Like I said, Karen has always been like a little sister to me and I'm not going to bad mouth her to her boyfriend. But truthfully, if this were anyone else, I would tell him it's not worth it and to leave her.

This has gotten really long already but my main concern is that Javier's turning 21 in a few months and he's been talking about how excited he is and how he's not going to let anything hold him back anymore. I didn't even want to ask what that meant when he first said it, but I'm concerned he's planning on breaking up with Karen. I would not be able to tell Karen any of this, so I'm wondering if I should tell Isabel? I've never told her any of the stuff Javier tells me. He's never told me not to, but he knows how close I am with them. I just don't really know if it's my place? I definitely think Karen needs to work through some issues and I don't want her or Javier getting hurt. Any advice would be greatly appreciated and I apologize for how long this is

TL;DR: Best friend's sister's boyfriend is telling me stuff showing signs of how increasingly unhappy he is in their relationship, unsure if I should warn my best friend before he ends up breaking it off?"
"An old very close friend(18f) recently contacted me through text even though I (19m) never thought she would and I’m confused as to why. Any ideas / thoughts?


Sorry for such a bad title didn’t really know what to say. 

Anyway this is a really complicated situation but basically her and I became very close friends very quickly. This whole time she had a boyfriend and yet we talked everyday and spent a very large amount of time together. I was in love with her and she knew it and in many ways was leading me on. I was basically a second boyfriend only without the kissing and sex. There was a lot of cuddling and a lot of secrets exchanged and dates we shared. To cut to the point we both seemed to value each other very much. In fact she has even told me she loves me whether she meant it (platonic or not) or didn’t mean it at all we exchanged I love yous many times.

About 6 months into our short but extremely memorable and wonderful relationship she began ghosting me. I was graduated from high school and school was out so we didn’t have to run into each other everyday. Easy for her to ghost me through text. It took sometime until she finally said we cannot be friends anymore and this is how it is we both must move on. So after some protest we stopped talking. She said she doesn’t want to have friends and just wants to finish high school and leave.

This messed me up bad, I cared greatly for this woman. She was the first I had truly felt in love with and although she had a boyfriend I was for the most part happy being her friend. Anyway after many nights of crying and many therapy sessions later I’m doing much better and have moved on for the most part. I still miss her dearly but, I don’t really cry anymore. The few times I’ve seen her in person she acts as if we don’t know each other and doesn’t talk which is understandable. 

We see each other a bit because of gymnastics, she still competes and I go to watch meets to see other friends of mine there. We will be around each other a lot more when guys start competing. I plan on assistant coaching and she helps manage the team so that will be something.. being around her that much. 

Anyways I might of left out some stuff but

On December 14th I sent her a happy birthday text. Nothing crazy just wishing her a happy birthday and saying hope you’ve been well. She responded “Thank you, (my name)” and that was that. We went back to not talking until recently she texted me. I don’t know why. She asked if she could ask me a question about games. She wished to know if downloading games on her laptop would ruin it or slow it down. Anyways I kind of thought she was trying to start small talk to slowly reconnect and maybe she would ease into an apology of some sort. I answered her question and she said thank you and that was that. The next day I tried starting small talk. We went back and forth for about 4 texts then she stopped responding. The next day I tried again, no response. A week later I asked why she would ask something like that if she didn’t want to talk to me. No response. 

I know that no one can tell what others are thinking and why she may have done this but maybe some guesses or insights or anything would be helpful. This whole situation confuses me. I never thought she would do what she did and hurt me how she did and I don’t really believe her reason why but it’s all confusing. I don’t think she was using me by asking this question because it wasn’t like she was putting her emotional troubles on me to help her. It was a stupid question that easily could of been answered through the internet or anyone else. If she really didn’t want to talk anymore which seems obvious as she had stopped responding again why would she text asking something so rudimentary? 


TLDR: Close friend who broke my heart and said we couldn’t speak anymore asked a very random simple question and then went back to no speaking shortly after answering. Why would she do this? Insights, advice, tips, thoughts?"
"I (26F) was hit by a driver (50s?F) while crossing the road on a crosswalk. Should I reach out to her and let her know I am recovering well and that I forgive her?


So I was hit by a moving car early last week while crossing the road and sustained a concussion and some minor injuries. It all happened very fast and most of the details are very blurry to me. 

But I remember that the driver was a very nice woman, she got out of her car and ran towards me when she saw that I was hit, and held my hand the whole time while we waited for the police and the EMS after someone called 911. I didn’t even realize she was the driver at first and I was apologizing for laying in the middle of the road and holding up the traffic. And she said, “oh sweetie, stop apologizing, I was the one who hit you”. She also claimed full responsibility to the police and also gave me her name and contact info. The last thing I remember about her was how distraught and genuinely concerned she looked when the paramedics took me away. 

I have been receiving great medical attention and counseling, and my insurance claims are being handled by my attorney. My understanding is that the claims will be relatively straight forward since she claimed full responsibility in the police report which I really appreciate. 

But I keep wondering if it would be a good idea to contact her at some point and let her know that I am recovering well and not to worry? Everyone has shown me a lot of support and lots of “oh you poor thing” since I’m the “victim,” but I think the incident has probably been as traumatic for her as it has been for me, but she is probably not receiving the same kind of support and sympathy? Would it help with her own recovery if I reached out and if so, what should I say?

Thank you for reading!

Tldr: pedestrian got hit by a car, would like to let the driver know that I am recovering well and that I forgive her but not sure if she would want to hear from me or what to say. "

"My(21F) bf(23M) keeps liking his ex(22F)’s photos on FB


Excuse my bad English plz



We are a long distance couple (Korea-Netherlands) and we are going to close the gap in 2 weeks. (Weve been together for more than a year)



My bf and his ex have known each other for 9 years, they were together for 1 year and broke up 5 years ago and they are still friends. (He had another ex after her) He told me they broke up because she was very religous and he isnt so it didnt work out well for them. They both know that its never gonna work so thats why that could stay friends. Thats what he told me.

We have been on and off because of the distance,(we havent seen each other since June) and i feel like they got closer when we were kinda off. 

Nowadays he likes every photo of hers, (she is also close to his family so my bf’s mom also likes every photo of hers) and yesterday he loved a photo of hers. (He put a heart?) It was a picture of her doing a voluntary job or something. Today i called him and asked him why, and he said she has been having a hard time like him and he was just happy to see her doing something proper. And he said like “aww you are jealous, i knew we both are jealous types.”


I am also jealous because he also gave her a chiristmas present which was a polaroid camera of his step father. He said no one used that camera cuz it costs a lot of money to take pictures and she likes old things so he though he would just give it to her. He said he didnt spend a euro on that gift. And he also said he thought that camera was shit.



The other day, we talked about his friend cheating on his long distance gf. He said he thinks its better to tell each other when they are cheating because it hurts more when you find out than when you hear. And he also said that if i cheated on him and tell him, he will be very sad and dissapointed but he will think at least i was honest with him, so he will eventually get back with me after he heals. He said like “so we should tell each other honestly when we did something” 


I think everything he says makes sense and he is a honest guy, but i just cant stop thinking that they got closer when we were off. I wanna trust him but something in my mind tells me to doubt. 
I know i have trust issues and i even talk to a therapist everyweek. I just dont know if im being too sensitive or its a weird situation.



Tl;dr: my bf got closer with his ex when we were kinda off, now he likes(and even loves) every photo of hers and its getting on my nerves. Im jealous. Am i too sensitive?"
"Girlfriend doubting


I [20m] am a jerk and drove her [20f]  away. I love her very much and have checked into domestic violence class and a 1x1 counselor because i havent treated her right...  I professed my love for her and she did too. However i get anxious when she doesnt snapchat me back (she has no phone) 

I told her I need to focus on my self i guess and what i can control because i kept telling her I get scared when she leaves me all day wondering. She texted back at 2 am when i was asleep and said everythings ok, but then she started iver thinking and said to let me know if i dont love her because thats how she feels. 

She is out of state and we agreed 3 months for me to get better and control my anger. It feels so long though and i worry everyday she will stop loving me. 

How can we make this better. I fed exed a phone to my sisters house and she said she will pick it up but that was before she said she want to know if i truley love her. 

TL;DR How do I stay calm when she doesnt text back. Is she gonna come back? "
"My ex (16) cheated on me but i (16) want her back


 

my girlfriend(16) and i(16) broke up 2 months ago she was my first love and it was really hard to let go we were together for almost 2 years a little background her past BF was her first one he was abusive and he was asking for her nude pictures and end up spreading it out to his friends we were in the same school so i knew about this i fix her by giving her warmth and comfort as it is what a guy should do for his love one, when we decided to date at first we fought a lot and we would get mad with each other for no clear reason but we later on learn about each other we were just starting high school but she told me she wanted to study abroad at the start i didn't really know how to react but end up supporting her decision

She finally went abroad a few months after our first anniversary it was really hard for me and her but we went through even if that means giving up my time just to call her most of the days she was gone face timing her was my best part of the day even she went back home every 1 or 2 months i still miss her dearly and give her all of my attention every single day we were going really great or i thought we were

when she came back late november i was really excited to meet her this month because it was her birthday month things went really great she was back for a week at the end of it since it past her birthday she wanted to treat in one of the best restaurant in the city i could say it was one of our best dates i bought her roses before got out and we really enjoy it since i need to drop of her to her house but she ask me to park first on the side of her house because she say she need to tell me something

She said that she want's to break up with me because she need some time to her self find out herself and love herself i was devastated but decided to do what best for her because i really love her and i want what is best for her she gave me hope that we can be back to being in a relationships later on it hurt me in every single aspect but i keep on holding to her and decided that we were going to be really close friends just for now

I was planing to ask her back to be my GF again but in early january she told me that she cheated on me (she only saw him twice in october) basically she felt that i was not doing my best that i don't really listen or care about her anymore even though i tried my best or i thought i did everything i could she told me she was depressed she has no one to talk to maybe i took her for granted but i never felt i did that she told me that she was randomly downloading apps and accidentally downloaded a dating app that she decided to use and she never told me about it with the factor of being in long distance relationship i can't spy on her every single move and i push her to have more guys friends and make more connection i was secretly jealous about it but i though since im not there she should socialize more

she also told me that she had a new boyfriend back in our town which mean she is gonna go through long distance relationship again she met her boyfriend on the same at she uses to cheat on me they never meet before and she was only talking to him for only about 3 or 4 weeks before he decided to ask her to be her girlfriend by voicemail and my ex accepted to be his girlfriend when she told me this it made me physically sick because she just found out about him for a few weeks and never meet him IRL before i didn't knew that i was that easy to be replace but what do i know anyways

I decided to still be friends with her but im struggling to find a reason why to hold on i didn't know why but i still lover her through all of that she did to me im still hoping that i could take her back one day i ask her if there is a chance for us in the future and she only said that anything could happen since she was back in my town this for a month this time before going back we decided to see each other but she still give me signs like hold my hand and she tried to feed me but at the same time we chat so little almost like she is ignoring me even though i know she is always on her phone i really don't know what to do now since she is back for a long period of time i can finally she her more often i really want to try to not see or contact her but there is a chance that she is not going back a long time after this

TL;DR : my ex was my first love we are on long distance for half of our relationships i did everything i can to make her happy she come home every one or two months for about a week at a time but she broke up because she felt she need time to find herself but she end up telling me that she cheated on me and have a new boyfriend (not the same guy she cheated on me with ) i decided to stay friends but im not sure on what to do

I don't know what to do because i still love her i want to move on but it is so hard to do since she was my first love and i really want her back i really don't want to lose contact because she truly made me happy and showed me what love is but at the same time i don't t want to deal with the pain anymore im just lost and didn't know what to do"

"I (25M) am in a doubt about whether my girlfriend (26F) still talking to her ex should make me feel bad or not? Please help me out here, I am new to reddit.


I was in a long distance relationship and about three months into the relationship, my girlfriend came to meet me in the city I was living and while we were on the way to a date night, I saw her texting an ex in the cab, who she was definitely hung up on (for about 4 years) at least 8 months before the relationship and after I saw her texting him, I felt bad about it and so I just kept my feelings to myself and got quiet.  
Seeing that I don’t like it and I am slightly angry and sad, she turned around the conversation in such a way that at the end I had to apologise for the way I was feeling while that ex was asking her to meet him. She didn’t meet him btw.

I was told that I am being too sensitive and stupid and not able to understand that there is nothing there.

When we were breaking up, I brought this incident forward and she took a couple of days and sort of justified what she did back then by saying that  
“We can’t blame our past selves for the knowledge and wisdom our present self has” but my point is that you can atleast own up to it and at the least without any caveat, just apologise about it.

She hasn’t done it by the way by herself, I had to bring it up again and again and only after saying that at least apologise, that she did.

TL;DR My Gf made me apologize for feeling bad about her texting an ex, while we were going out on a date when she came to meet me in a long-distance relationship.

Am I being overly sensitive here?

Was it wrong for me to feel what I felt?

I just want to ensure that I am thinking straight.

"My girlfriend (24f) found an old reddit message of mine (27m/ straight) to another man about a random hook up during a relapse.


Ok,  there are a lot of parts to this, so I'm going to do my absolute best to make everything come together to make sense. so my girl and I have been together for just over 2 years. She is amazing and the love of my life. In the title I mentioned a relapse. It lasted about 8 months or so. Before that I had been sober for about 4 years. I'm now 5 months clean since my relapse. 


So of course during my relapse the relationship was rocky because of all the lies that come with addiction. Most of these lies were about making something up to where I was disappearing to when I would be gone for 10 hours going to another state to re-up. My drug of choice was heroin, with the occasional mix in of coke. Well, one day when I was doing coke I was watching porn like many people do when they are on uppers. I'm straight and have never had any desire to do anything with a guy. Well while I was high, a guy had posted on my towns local reddit page looking for a quick meetup/ blow and go. I was very surprised to see this right out on the town page.especially while I had been watching porn. I've heard of guys doing drugs like coke or meth and wanting to do gay things which they normally wouldn't ever want to do sober. 


I message the guy and we send about 5 messages back and forth over the course of maybe 15 min. I then come to my senses and realize what I'm doing. So I stop responding. He sends a few angry messages asking why I'm not replying so I block him. This was about 10 months ago. 


Fast forward to now. Gf and I are both trying to work on ourselves as well as our relationship. We are both pretty different people. I like my alone and quiet time, she's the opposite. Stuff like that. Our sex Life has also had its issues but it's my fault. My girlfriend is extremely beautiful. She's my picture perfect girl. Over the course of my 4 year sobriety I was a hardcore gym addict. During that time I was doing a lot of steroids from the streets as well as from my doctor which at the time was great. When I relapsed I stopped taking them and going to the gym all at once. My testosterone went down the toilet and so did my sexdrive. I went and got blood work and my levels were pretty much that of a girl. I'm on hormone replacement therapy now and getting back to normal. 


So my sex drive is still very very low. My gf's is very very high. I try my best to keep up but she also puts a lot of pressure on me and it makes it even harder. She of course thinks it's because of her or that I'm not attracted to her, but that couldn't be further from the truth. I only have eyes for her. I would even have to have a picture of her up on my phone while watching porn on my iPad. 


Last night my gf comes out to me while I'm playing xbox and asks if I've ever cheated on her. I tell her "" of course not"" and don't think much of it because she's asked me this 100's of times.( she's been cheated on before). I'm not going to go into it but she has ptsd and anxiety from experiences of her past. I'm trying my best to understand it and not get mad when it effects our relationship. Like when we go to the grocery store I walk with head down the whole time so she doesn't think I'm looking at other girls or they are looking at me, or that she's no pretty or doesn't make me happy. I know this isn't her fault and try not to hold it against her. So after I tell her "" honey, I love you and wouldn't ever cheat on you."" She then asks me, "" have you ever tried to cheat on me?"" I tell her "" of course not"" 


She then pulls out her phone and shows me a pic of the message thread I explained earlier with the guy from reddit. I had completely forgotten about this. To me it was so insignificant and blocked it out my Mind as I couldn't believe I would message another guy something like that. In the messages you can clearly see I stopped responding to him and eventually blocked him. Well with her finding this and me Having no sex drive the last few months..... You can only imagine what's going through her head. She might be thinking that I'm actually gay or that maybe she turned me gay? Idk the conversation blew up and as soon as she confronted me about the message she went into a panic attack. There was no discussing the situation or anything. We were both upset and she left instantly and stayed at her mothers, which is just 5 min away. 


I guess the reason I'm writing this is to get my thoughts down and because this isn't really something I can talk to my friends for/ get advice because it's very embarrassing that while I was high I debated doing a gay meet up. She's the love of my love and seeing her unhappy was the final straw that made me check myself into rehab. I'm staying clean because I want to give her and our beautiful dogs the wonderful life that we all deserve. I've never cheated on her or anyone else in my life, but there is no way to really prove that. 

I congratulate you if you've somehow made it through this train wreck. Sorry for the length. Cheers reddit community. 

(TL;DR: My gf (24f) went on my iPad and found a message where I(27m) spoke to another guy about meeting up and hooking up. This was about 10 months ago during a relapse. I've never cheating on her with any guy or girl and am not guy. I was curious and made a mistake and hope she doesn't take it personally. "
"Man [stranger] I rehomed my [22F] dog to has started texting me about my personal life


Backstory. I am a 22 year old female. I live alone in my fwb/ex boyfriend (of 2 years) house. He travels for work and is only here once a month. I take care of the house and watch it while he is away. Please don’t make irrelevant comments over my relationship and living situation because this isn’t what the post is about and I know how Reddit can get. 

Anyway, Back in November I was given a puppy by a family member who had no place for it. The dog was a stray and very young. I am in college and work 6 days a week. I quickly realized the dog needed more attention than I could give. I turned to craisgslist to look for someone to take the dog. 

One morning, I received a text from a person expressing he wanted the dog. He said he was a man in his late 30’s, unemployed, who had a dog that just died and he wanted another. 

I texted with him a bit and stupidly gave him my address to come pick up the dog. I realize this was extremely stupid. I was just in over my head and not thinking.

The man comes to my house and he appears to be a clean cut, normal, very nice man. We talked for a bit and he asked why I was giving away the dog. I STUPIDLY told him that my boyfriend had recently started working out of town and I no longer had help with the dog and didn’t want to leave it alone all day because he doesn’t deserve that. The man understood and took the dog. 

He told me he would send me photos of the dog as he grew. I didn’t really want them, but I just said oh okay thanks and that was it. 

He sent me photos on Christmas and I thanked him. 

Today the man sends me more pics (which I thought was odd since the dog hasn’t changed any in a few weeks) and I replied “glad he’s doing good. Thanks for the pics.” And left it at that. The man began asking me about my personal life as in what kind of job I have, what I’m doing after i finish school, how I have been. What I have been up to, etc. I thought this was odd seeing as how I met him for 5 minutes one time. But I kept the convo light and kept trying to wrap it up. He kept texting and even went as far to tell me he is recently divorced and wants me to help him with his thesis (???) he also refers to me by my first name in every text, as if he knows me personally. Like “Jane how are you today” etc. that’s just an example, not the actual text. 

I stopped responding. 

What I’m about to type could be completely unrelated, but it connects in my mind and seems odd. The house I live in is extremely secure. In a safe neighborhood, we have alarms on every entryway, a security system, and 2 glass shatter sonic alarms. One on the back glass door and one on the marble glass window above the bathtub in the master bath. One night about a week ago, I was up late about 1AM watching a movie on my laptop in the master bedroom. All of a sudden, someone or something pounded the master bathroom window with extreme force causing the glass shatter alarm to trigger and begin going off. I FREAKED out and locked myself in the guest bedroom and just sat there hoping nothing else would happen. 

I was going to call the police, but I told myself it was probably a kid playing a prank or it was a bat or animal or some sort. We have no trees in the entire neighborhood so I know it wasn’t something falling from a tree or anything. 

Like I said, I’m not trying to accuse anyone of anything. I know that texting someone is completely different than attempting to break into or prowl around someone’s home or whatever was going on. I know that some people are just friendly and like small talk, but it just seems odd to me that a man I met for 2 min in my driveway is speaking to me as if he’s known me for years and trying to find out personal stuff about me. I’m just saying, it makes me wonder. I asked a male coworker what he thought. He read the texts and immediately told me that it was odd and seemed very strange to him. 

I told fwb/ex and he told me to be straight up with the guy and ask him why he’s trying to get to know me and why he’s asking me personal questions. I really don’t think that’s a good idea. I am the type to avoid confrontation at all costs and just ignore problems until they go away. Since I was dumb and basically invited the guy to my house, I don’t know how to feel or what to think. I’m not scared to be in my own home, but it’s odd. 

Is this odd, or am I over reacting? Am I crazy for this? 

Tl;dr man from craigslist keeps contacting me about personal things "

"I [28F] don’t “do discussions” the way he [M28] wants, and after 4 years it’s suddenly a dealbreaker.


I’ll start with a bit about my background. My parents divorced when I was three, my mom was unmedicated bipolar alcoholic into my 20s, and dated lots of dangerous addicts. My dad married another unmedicated bipolar woman and was emotionally distant. I tried to shield my younger siblings from this chaos. We moved close to 20 times and I developed serious anger issues at home, while maintaining straight A’s at school.

My boyfriend grew up in the most stable family I’ve ever heard of. His parents are loving and supportive, they built the house they live in, no addictions, no abuse, not a single traumatic incident to speak of. He is kind and sensitive and curious and intelligent.

Some issues have been brought to light very recently in our relationship: I’ve been overly controlling, he has been doing too much emotional labor, I’ve been too needy, he hasn’t been honest with his feelings, etc. We’ve been working on those. But there’s one that keeps coming up and I don’t know how to handle it.

I seldom start or engage in… these kinds of discussions. I want to call them “intellectual” but they’re not always about intellectual things, it’s just that they’re done in an intellectual way. For example, recently he wanted to talk about “Brownian motion,” which is ""the random motion of particles suspended in a fluid (a liquid or a gas) resulting from their collision with the fast-moving molecules in the fluid.” I… don’t know what he wanted me to say about that other than “wow, cool, I never heard of that!” 

Another time he wanted to talk about something he realized about why The Simpsons went downhill, and comparing it to Futurama. I love both of them so I really engaged in this conversation and thought I “did a good job…” But he told me I wasn’t as excited as he thought I would be.

My boyfriend is curious to the point that he will learn all there is to learn about any random topic (often science, math, and history) and then want to talk at length about it. Although I was a good student, I’ve always been very ashamed of not knowing things, and will avoid admitting it at all costs. I’m learning that he wants me to ask questions, and show genuine interest in all sorts of topics. He doesn’t seem to understand that it’s a skill I never developed. When I tell him this, he says that he really thinks that I’m interested in things at all. That I have no passions or interests. 

He thinks all I want to do is criticize/judge other people, show him the clothes I bought, or show him how I reorganized the kitchen. I mean… yeah, I like doing those things (well, I want to be less judgmental!). But I also want to talk to him about something cool I learned about the Japanese language, or a psychology study I just read about, or something I learned about nutrition but he seems to only see the “misses,” never the “hits.”

I’m just totally stumped. Every time I notice him withdrawing, I ask him what’s up and we have the same conversation again. He keeps saying, “I’m just worried you don’t have any interests or passions,” or, “I don’t think that you’re interested in having these kinds of conversations with me.” I admit that I haven’t been *good* about it, and I often didn’t know the way he wanted to engage with me. It’s totally unfamiliar to me. Every relationship (parental, family, or friend) has been just waiting for one’s turn to speak, or getting “uh-huh, yeah, cool…” as a response. His “way” has not been modeled to me. His family will sit together for hours (literally) arguing about the Monty Hall problem. You couldn’t get my family to spend 5 minutes on it.

I’m trying to learn but I really don’t think I’m getting the support I need. The other day he sent me this paper (Thomas Kuhn: ""What Are Scientific Revolutions?”) and wanted to know my thoughts on it. He’d read the book it came from, various reviews of the book, and also knew all about the contents (Aristotle and Newton and stuff). Meanwhile I was going in totally blind. I guess he wanted me to ask tons of questions but I would have needed to ask 100 questions to understand it, and I’m not comfortable doing that! When I did venture an interpretation, turns out I’d thoroughly misinterpreted the entire piece. Now if that’s not discouraging…

Okay, I’ve began ranting. I have no idea what I expect anyone to say about this. But maybe an outside perspective will shed some light. I don’t want to be judgmental and closed off. I want to be curious and open.

**tl;dr: The way my boyfriend and I approach conversations is becoming a dealbreaker (for him). I don’t want to lose him over something this trivial, but it’s a lot of work for me and he doesn’t believe I want to change. How do we overcome this?**"

"I'm (30/f) Married to my husband (32/M) for 3 years, barely having sex and not feeling fulfilled. What do I do?


I'm looking for responses without judgement please. My husband loves me, and though he's not perfect, I know he cares about me and is a great guy. Unfortunately, we don't have the greatest sex life. I'm only 30, and we barely have sex. We both seem to not be as sexual with each other, and it might have to do with the fact that we had an abortion before we were married. It kind of put a big stigma around sex for us. Also, he's gained quite a bit of weight since we've been together, and I find myself less attracted to him physically.

He plays sports, goes to the gym regularly, but he still is overweight and I've lost a lot of the attraction. I get a lot of attention, and one guy in particular I've slipped up with. I know.... Im terrible. 

I obviously know that cheating is wrong, but im missing the sexual aspect in my marriage. I know that not having that is a big deal but we have so many positive qualities in our relationship, that its hard to walk away from. We also love each other in every other way and make a good team. We've done well for ourselves financially, have fun together and just generally are good together. 

We've tried couples counselling, and while it kind of helped a little bit, were still nowhere near having the sexual chemistry I need... He seems to be fine with the way things are? Although he knows its different....

I don't know what to do. I don't know whats important here. A solid relationship, or to lose everything to see what else is out there and be fulfilled sexually?

&amp;#x200B;

Tl;DR: Im lacking sex and that physical attraction in my marriage BUT I have a solid relationship where we both love each other. Is it worth leaving a good relationship to find that passionate complete love package that I always thought was out there?"

"What should I do with my ladyfriend / girlfriend because I am getting anxious in her response.


So I recently have become more than friends with one of my friends. The thing is she is leaving in 6 months and we both don’t want to start a serious relationship so we don’t know what to do. We talk a lot and have told each other some of our deepest secrets that we only trust each other with. I told her a few weeks ago that she can just pull me aside one day and talk to me on what we should do. That was nearly two weeks ago now. I have no idea on what I should do or even if I should bring it up. Help me reddit.

"What should I think of this convo between my exes dad and I? He is a 55/m and I’m a 25/f


He texts me about the shit I post on Instagram. We got to talking about my ex and his life and how he’s been doing. Here’s our convo:

Me: I mean is he really trying to make things work and really likes her? Or is it just like going though the motions? He keeps saying he wants to talk with me again in the future but I think it’ll never happen and I told him that’s fine it sucks but it’s fine

He: I don't know Jessica. You're pretty special. You're not that easy to forget. It's probably one of those things like, 'the heart says hang on, but head says let go'. Or vice versa.

Me: Hoping everything else is going well for y’all. Sorry for always talking about myself. It’s something I have to be more aware about

He: I brought you up the other. Ryan and I were golfing. Someone said something about slope. And I said speaking of slopes...when's the last time we went skiing? We should go again! Ryan said yeah it's been a while. I was like, you and Jessica went to Colorado that time and drove thru that snowstorm. He said yeah that drive was scary, but that was a fun trip. And then he just stopped and stared, and I could tell he was remembering things on that trip and he said yeah, that was a lot of fun. 


**TLDR: I love my ex still. My exes dad gives me hope. I’m afraid he just wants to sleep with me or best case he wishes I was still with my ex cause I’m a better fit**"

"has the internet changed relationships and marriage


In many ways. Firstly for us older folk pre internet you only had company socially with those in your house unless of course you went out your house lol to state the obvious. Secondly If you wanted to date or find a girl you had to go out and make efforts and spend money and time.

&amp;#x200B;

Now everything has changed, firstly forget about the social and sexual aspect of dating and just consider socialising in general, many people socialise 90% online with their free time. If guys are playing on their consoles with their buddies on headsets they are not sitting home alone needing or wanting company. So, maybe before its possible men living alone got lonely so had a partner etc, they don't need that anymore.

&amp;#x200B;

Then consider dating and sex, now their are even apps to find an instant date or sexual partner etc. You can have a list of potential partners at touch of a button.

&amp;#x200B;

What benefits or needs are their for commited relationships in this day and age.

&amp;#x200B;

Also, maybe before if you had a hot gf you had to worry about other guys hitting on her when she out etc, now she can get harassed on social media with perverts 24/7 lol not ideal."
