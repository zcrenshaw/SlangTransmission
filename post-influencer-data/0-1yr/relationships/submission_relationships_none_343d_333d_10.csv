"Girls [16 F] mocking me [16 F] because I kissed my cousin years ago? Is it really THAT weird?


I never thought it was weird, honestly, but girls around me are mocking me because I'm a creep and a weirdo because of it.

I told one of my friends about it because we were talking about boys and stuff like that, she asked me about my first kiss I told her it was my cousin when I was 10, he was 10 or 11.

At first she didn't say anything about it but later told our group of friends about it and they all started mocking me. The stupid thing is, that girl herself told me her then 15 o 16 year old cousin kissed her when she was 12. She told me they hid in a closet. I don't even know if it's true (and I know that guy) but I didn't judge her or anything.

Is it really weird? I thought it was a bit common at least and definitely didn't expect this reaction. Help?

**tl;dr:** Friends in school mocking me because I kissed my cousin 6 years ago. Is it that weird or are they exaggerating?"

"A treasure hunt


Got in a friends with benefits situation with a much younger guy (he's 24) a few months ago. He had just broken up with his girlfriend and I wasn't ready for commitment, which I made very clear from the start. (He is aware my previous relationships were deeply traumatic for me; cheating exes, gaslighting, physical violence, etc.) 

Long story short he started having feelings for me. He finally confessed a couple weeks ago and I said I did reciprocate, but I wasn't ready to commit yet. I was scared of jumping into a relationship too soon. He mentioned that I'd constantly been pushing him away and rejecting him every time he tried to tell me before, and looking back on our conversations, he was right. Now he doesn't want to talk at all anymore, blocked me on social media when I asked him why he kept looking at my Facebook stories, etc.

I'm not sure what to do now. I wanted to take it slow but as he said he wanted more. And I really do love him, but I need to know this isn't just a rebound or some temporary whim that won't last.

I think we both need time. I need to focus on dealing with my fears &amp; getting over my traumas before I can really feel ready to be a good partner to anyone. &amp; I think he needs time to really grieve the end of his previous relationship. Even if he knew it was dead before it ended, they shared a lot of wonderful memories together &amp; that's not just something that goes away with the flip of a switch, right?

I want him to know that I love him, but I can't email or text. So I was thinking of writing to him instead (old school pen &amp; paper), but I was thinking of making it sort of a treasure hunt (we're both Sherlock fans). It would be up to him to decode the clue to the location of the next page on the fourth of every month (we met on the 4th of July).

And, if he is willing to try again, I will wait for him at the place we met on the 4th of Feb 2019. Could go either way, at this point I have no idea if he'll even show up but that's a risk I'm willing to take.

Am I crazy for wanting to try &amp; do this? Or do you think maybe we could have a chance of starting over?

**TL;DR** - Is it worth it to try &amp; reach out to him after he blocked me?"
"30 year old M, getting dumped by 26 year old F out of the blue?


\*\*TL;DR; : **Getting dumped out of the blue?**?\*\*.

&amp;#x200B;

Basically, this all started when I met a girl in Oregon, I'm from California.  We met online and I told her i'd be in town visiting.  At first she seemed very interested in me, talked me the whole time I drove up.  Just natural flow of communication.  So when we met up, we hit off immediately.  She was very generous and showed me around town in Portland.  We hung out almost everyday other day for almost 2 weeks.   We had a connection, I could feel it. After dinner one night, she questioned me about my where the relationship was possibly going.  I told her, while I did like her.. I was bit nervous about entering another relationship so soon because I just ended one previously with my ex-fiance not even 5 months ago. I told her, I needed time.  ( major F up right there). She pretended to understand but of course didn't like my reaction.   In any event, we continued to hangout going to the Zoo, dinner, etc. Did all that romantic stuff.

After I left town, we remained in contact almost everyday till I could feel she was "" pulling back"" or becoming lukewarm with me.  I told her how I'm planning to relocate up there, or she could visit me.  At first she seemed receptive to the idea of visiting me, then became sorta cold. So a week or so goes by and she mentioned her ex bf had sent her flowers randomly, she said that there was "" no way I'd get back with him. He was too controlling"".  They broke up 10 months ago supposedly.  The timing seemed odd, because after that remark is when things seemed to downhill.   About a week after that ordeal, I sent flowers to her work which she seemed to enjoy.   Her text's were still kinda lukewarm and and I said asked her if  "" everything is ok?"" She replied "" no, its not. It's about us"".   She said basically I was a nice guy but.... She had a "" feeling the day I left"". She went on saying how she couldn't fulfill my needs,etc. I called her out saying I think she met someone else and is pushing me away. Telling me how I would find someone great, I'm a nice guy blah blah.  It's crazy because she was so into me.

&amp;#x200B;

So basically, I've been in no contact with her since Saturday. She Hasn't blocked me which is a good sign.  I noticed she also scrubbed her online profile, even changing the name. Pretty shady.   I'm starting to think was I rebound?  In retrospect, I think I should have pursued her from the start and told her I was ready. I now realize how strong my feelings are for her.  **Anyway, I can attempt to salvage this? I'm not heartbroken or anything just disappointed.**

"I [21 M] am in love with a woman [21 F] who isn't interested but want's me to be her friend. I want to cut off from her but she's told me she has suicidal intentions and I'm one of her only friends...


I really love this woman, I just want to be with her so bad when she's around me. I know that she doesn't want to be with me though but it hurts. I can deal with my problems normally but when I'm around her my suicidal ideation comes back because I know that she'll never want me the way that I want her. I want to die so bad when I'm around her but she has said herself that she's struggling for reasons to live and I can't not be empathetic towards that. I don't know what to do... I don't want to hurt her by cutting myself off from her. She already has few to no friends and she's said specifically after I have cut her off before that she's hurt by that and I couldn't live with myself if something bad happened to her. I don't want to cut her off from her only support I don't want to hurt her. I can't deny my feelings because I'm afraid that I'll hurt myself eventually if I try to keep being friends with her... help please I don't know what to do

TL;DR: I love this woman but I dont want to hurt her by cutting myself off please read the whole post though..."

"I [18M] and my ex [20F] broke up last year after 3 year long relationship. Can't get over her.


 So it's been over a year I broke up with my ex and I'm still madly in love with her and I'm basically broken.

 A bit of backstory. I met her when I was 12 and she was 14. She was always childish (in a cute, innocent sort of way) and short so I actually looked older than her. For about 2 years we were just friends and would play and hangout and stuff. One day (whne I was 15) we were walking down a street in winter and we were talking about families and stuff and I told her ""you know, you'd make a pretty good wife"" and she told the same back to me (as a husband obvi) and I realized I really like this girl, and it turned into a relationship.

 No much changed aside from kisses on the cheeks, and the most lewd thing we did were kisses on the neck and brief touching her body. We lived in a very conservative country and I actually did think waiting until we were married to pop it is a good idea and she agreed. When we were alone together we'd just cuddle, or I'd lay on her lap and she'd play with my fluffy hair, or she'd lay on my chest and I'd caress her back. 


 We never really had an argument, or even disagreement. She was so nice and always knew how to calm me down when I'd get angry at something or was just down. I'd do the same for her. 


 Anyway, all was fine and dandy until last year rolled around and for a very long and complicated reason I had to leave my home country and move, like, right away, and I wouldn't be able to go back for at least 10 years. 


 I was obviously heartbroken and so was she, and she begged to do LDR and such but to me it seemed like it would just be torture and pointless so I broke it off and just cut all contact after our goodbyes. 

 Ever since then I haven't been whole. I feel so depressed and alone. I haven't made any real friends here, the culture is extremely different and honestly I don't even like the people here. 

 I've tried finding new girls to do stuff with but I'm fairly ugly and haven't had much luck (my ex was also semi-unattractive when we first met and started dating but turned very beautiful later on, I got even uglier but she liked me).

 what the heck do I do? I feel depressed and alone. I miss her sweet voice and company. How do I find someone like that again? The only girls I've found so far are vapid whores and attention seekers. I'm not a fuckboy or someone looking to get laid, I just want an SO. What do I do to suppress this feeling?


tl;dr I broke up with my ex due to outside reasons and haven't been able to fix myself, still feel alone and depressed. How 2 fix?"
"(30F) My weird bachelor father (65M) is obviously wearing women's thongs on his unannounced visits to our home in front my hubs &amp; child.


Throwaway because jesus christ Ew.

Background info: 

My husband ,son, and I (only child)  are no contact with his ex-wife ,my biological mother. 

They have been split for almost 30 years and he has been single since. Visitation stoped around age 5 and I didn't have a relationship with him again my him until my late teen years when I was removed by CPS from my abusive mother. Had my own apartment and non frequent visits with him from then on.

 (Mother is a whole other post for / raisedbynarcs but anyways)

He has been alone for basically 30 years (his parents stayed with him part months of the year annually until 6 yrs ago)  He has a pessimistic attitude about everything in life and is, in general,  quite a sour old fart really. Has the same 5 outfits since the 90s, wears them weeks at a time, only turns his hot water on monthly because its a waste of hydro otherwise (double facepalm) this man wouldnt even put on deodorant for my wedding. Claims he "" hasnt worn it for 30 years he aint gonna change now""

He constantly enjoys being the victim, soaks up any miss deed and milks it *forever* . To this DAY during normal ""hows the weather"" conversation, he will try to throw jabs at something my mother did 35 years ago!! Its so frustrating he's never let go of any of it. He is always critical, ignores or minimizes accomplishments , and rarely has a positive thing to say. Even when he tries to be nice its ends up an insulting joke most the time. 


 Im getting off track here with his shitty way of life sorry, I've accepted there's no way to change his behaviour, we take him with a **chunk** of salt because its quite obvious he's a jaded old man......anyways now that you have an idea of him.....



**Besides his crummy attitude, The current issue is: 

A bright blue womens string thong on display out his backside during his visit to our home today for the 2nd time.**

The first time my hubbs and I saw this was a few weeks back. He was over for an unannounced visit in the morning, he was picking green beans in our front garden with his grubby, tattered &amp; small 90s T shirt , paired with low rise jean shorts. (Think old beer bellied man with the bottom of his fupa hanging out 🤢 His shorts needed a belt badly) 

Yeah so, Short shirt, low pants.... womens thong highly visible :/

There's was no way NOT to see this nasty blue string thing pulled up his ass crack and back. Hes bent over and his shirt is up to his mid back, theres no way he couldnt feel it exposed like wtf?

 Hubby and I just looked at each other in shock. We keep the kid from seeing anything and decide to talk about it later. We say nothing to him but are just baffled, my husband mostly laughing and myself just WTF WTF WTF ing out loud later.

Thinking about it afterwards, pondering a million reasons why he would show up like this..... Im really a bit more disturbed its some secret weird sexual thing because of the time . He woke up in the morning and purposely dressed himself in that to come here. On purpose, like what the actual F is going on?

So, TODAY he shows up unnanouced as always to apparently help my hubby do some outside clean up and unloading. Ironically wearing the same short nasty old beat up t shirt as the last peekaboo incident. Short shirt ... low pants.... guess what?

My husband texts me from outside"" hes wearing the thong again!!""

Im just baffled? Like if he just wants to be a woman or something that's fine, but you'd think it would be a more discreet personal issue for him if he was struggling with his gender idendity, why flaunt this women's undergarment thing out of your ass in front of your family?

 Like it doesnt add it up and Im concerned hes getting something sick out of doing this? What logical reason or situation would make this normal?! Nothing I can ponder!?? 

He came in the house shortly after the text with the thing in full view of me!! Theres no fucking way you can't feel your shirt rolled halfway up your back with your pants under your crack. LIKE HALF HIS BACK IS EXPOSED!!! AND THERES THIS NASTY BLUE STRING THONG WEDGIED UP HIS ARSE?! 

He goes past me to get a beer out of the fridge and I (poor decision) *yell* at him ""What in the fuck are you wearing?!"" He turns slightly and mumbles , pulling at his shirt. I say with disgust ""pull your fucking shirt down.""..... He does without saying a word, gets his beer, and goes back out with husband for an hour or so and eventually leaves without coming in to say goodbye to me. (Not unusual ) I admit I didn't handle myself well but how do you politely demand answers about someone's innapropriate undergarments?! 

So what the fuck do I do? This is so weird I really am lost. Ignoring this feels wrong. It could be harmless , but the more I try to rationalize that the logic fades. It cant be comfortable , or funtional , leaves me with sexual deviance or something.....but why wear it here?!?! If this was something he enjoyed behind his own closed doors that's one thing, if he wants to transition to female or something that's another. In fact I hope that's the problem but the situation doesnt scream ""transgender"" to me . 

If he is getting off on ""secretly"" (Ya right?!)  wearing these panties around us has me really concerned and shocked.

Im not even sure what answers Im looking for? What do I say to him? Do I really need to set a fucking dress code in my own home about adult undergarments? Do I cut contact with him over his underwear choices?! What the fucking fuck 😣





****** more context or irrelevant babbling below

List of random incidents of past weird behaviour that may or may not be relevant here . So awkward and embarrassing to type but trying to give as much context as I can .  

*
2nd ""reunion"" visit with him 15 years ago after growing up away from him, Patted me on the ass as I was getting my boots on at the door. I told social worker. They spoke to him , reasoning sounded innocent , he still saw me as a little child not a young woman as I felt I was.  I did believe that , he has not ever touched me outside of a hug I intiate since. Still weird tho :/


*
Also super creep weird was his staring at my chest over the years. I did develop early and easily fit a D cup around the time I re-united with him. Not often, but enough times I have caught him staring at my breasts.  Which like what the fuck? Just EW wtf? ....  I get it was hard for him to say goodbye to a little child and have her replaced with a curvy bull headed young woman he didnt know years later , but this has always bothered me in the back of my mind. Ive never had to balls to just say ""what the fuck are you looking at"" when I notice, I generally get a sweater and dont wear anything form fitting around him. 

As a teen I found secret hidden folders on his computer full of adult female models he had pathetically given digital breast enlargements via Microsoft paint . Like literally cropping their tits, blowing it up and pasting it over the OG 😂 ....... I only mention this because it seems he is heterosexual. Lessening my theory hes gay/ trans, unless hes a lesbian in a mans body? IdFK what's politically correct here.

Few years ago hubbs and I stopped by to see him shirtless airing out his nipple piercings . Ew. Whatever, but ew.

"EXPOSE MY EX TO HER PARENT


Hi everyone. I just recently broke up with my ex. She is REALLY Toxic, from her best friends, lifestyle, and the way she love. To keep it short, after all I accepted everything she done wrong and improve myself to make her happier. Suddenly 3 weeks later she tells me I can't hide anymore I am no longer in love with you. I feel sorry for you because you are a good guy. Let's be bestfriend (the same way she treated her other ex who is a gay dude that took her virginity). I do not accept being friend !

Her parents think she is a princess and high value because I have always been humble and focus on self improvement. As a result they think I am a piece of shit, that done everything wrong to her. I want to text her uncle and her father about how bad she is. Expose the fuck out of her from cheating on me, gold digging me, to how bad her environment and wild lifestyle is!
I did everything a man suppose to do. But of course, no man is perfect. She disrespectful, childish, and using me. Should I expose her and tell them reason why I ""broke up with her"" 1st?"
"Insecurities


I'm a 29 year old male that has been cheated on 3 times in my life. so im very insecure when it comes to relationships. i'm currently in a Long distance relationship with a girl and im trying to keep my emotions intact and get over my insecurities for us to work because i really like this girl. The problem is me and her are from totally different worlds. like she doesn't see anything wrong with liking half naked men photos on instagram, as for me i've never liked any half naked woman pictures while in a relationship. so it kind of bothers me. when we are on the phone she is sometimes really silent but she is having side conversations with guys on facebook about a random subject, but not talking to me while on the phone. she gets mad at me when i tell her my feelings about it and says i make her feel like she cant talk to ppl. sometimes its really late at night and i just don't like her texting someone in my ear while its 12am. i feel like it can wait. Don't get me wrong she is a wonderful girl and i'm sure the conversations are harmless, but i just hate it. it make my mind wonder and think about awful things. my question is, is there anything i can do to help my thought pattern? any advice on how to handle this? she said she would stop the half naked picture liking. so that's fine, but sometimes i feel like there are side conversations going on that idk about. Idk i just need someone to talk to. some encouragement or advice. Thank you for listening. "
"Should I give him a chance to go to anger management?


My [22F] husband [23M] and I have had a great relationship for the most part. Lately though it seems like he can’t stand to not get his way. He’s always had issues with this since his parents babied him growing up and never really told him no.  


It’s been annoying but usually when the issue comes about we just argue and then resolve the argument eventually. Lately though he has become very aggressive when he doesn’t get his way.  He kicks things or throws things along with giving threats of violence and verbal abuse.   



He hasn’t put his hands on me but he has threatened to before. It’s like an adult toddler having a tantrum except it could turn into something more dangerous.  


Today he had his worst outburst yet when I told him no to using my car when he had somewhere he wanted to be.  This involved  amongst other things him kicking the dogs kennel at me and charging at me. He didn’t actually hit me though.  I got really scared and so did our dog and cat.   I told him I would call the cops if he didn’t stop so he eventually did.  




He says he will go to anger management to deal with these issues and I want to give him a chance but I’m so sick of dealing with these outburst.  Should I give him a chance to go? I’m not sure what I should do. "
"Is it fair for me (24f) to ask my boyfriend (27m) to create his own checking account without his parents on it?


I'm not sure if this is something that I should be concerned about, or if its pretty normal.  My boyfriend and I have been living together for a few years, and he's always relied very heavily on his parents (particularly his dad) for advice. He calls them multiple times a day, which I'm fine with. His dad is retired and kind of a mother-hen type personality. His mom is much more relaxed. 

Basically, my boyfriend has worked part time jobs while in school, and his dad would monitor his checking/credit card statement and deposit money/pay his bills as needed. My boyfriend worked a part time internship while completing his masters, and his parents had him start paying all of his own bills.

Fast forward to now, where my boyfriend and I moved half way across the country from his parents, and he got his first 9-5 M-F salaried job. I'm just not sure how I feel about his dad still monitoring his credit card and checking account like he's still an undergrad in college. His dad will make comments about how much money he spends on XYZ, which I just think is kind of weird, as I got my own bank account when I was 18 and I think my finances are largely none of my parents business. 

There was one instance where my student loans didn't come through, so my boyfriend paid my tuition, $3000 worth, so that I wouldn't get a late fee until my loans came in the following week. His dad called him up and started demanding to know why he spent thousands of dollars overnight, kept asking ""Are you in some kind of trouble your mom and I don't know about?"" 

Is it weird if I ask my boyfriend to open his own checking account? I can't put my finger on why it bothers me that his dad can see every dollar he spends (and his dad checks regularly, because he comments and I overhear), but it kind of does. 

TLDR: My boyfriend's dad monitors his credit card/checking accounts, and I feel there's no need for his dad to watch his bills anymore now that he has a full time professional job. I don't know if I have a right to ask him to open his own independent checking account, because I don't know if I should feel bothered by this "
"My (23F) boyfriend (27M) is making me very upset.


I'm so hurt right now. I'm so annoyed and sick of this. If I sound ""over dramatic"" during this rant, please blame my emotions. My boyfriend and I have been together for about 4 years. We met Fall of 2014. He was in the military until September 2016. When he would come home, he wouldn't make THAT much time for me but I completely understood because he could only come home a few times a year. I would join him and hang with him and his friends during those days. When he came home for good he seemed to do the same thing. It would make me upset. He is a very loyal, genuine, and caring boyfriend for the most part. He goes out of his way and makes sure I'm taken care of. He compliments me and makes me feel good about myself. This is great. But there are some traits about him that are not so great...let me just also say that I am difficult to deal with. I can be needy, demanding and hard to please. I have good intentions I just get carried away sometimes. I think I may over communicate. If I feel upset I will make SURE he knows every pain I feel and why. He doesn't have many true friends. He has 1 good childhood friend, and all of his other friends are just friends from that friend. He likes to skateboard and dirtbike, which is cool. It's just not my thing. I am trying to move to LA and be a pop star (no like seriously though. it's all i've ever wanted to do). He's also very hollow. He consumes himself with whoever he is around. When he first came home he lived with a family member (who happens to be one of my old co-workers/great friend) from September 2016-May 2017. He moved out and got a place with his friend. After the move he started to change. His friend is an asshole, just a total jerk. He kind of has that ""douche bag hick persona."" He voted for Trump (gag). He likes places in the country in the middle of no where and enjoys dirtbiking, fishing, hunting, etc. I hate all of these with a passion (dirtbiking whatever...but hunting and fishing...once again...GAG). We were cool with each other but during the election in 2016 we were at a bar and I started talking about women's rights. Apparently this offended him because he walked out. It's been weird with him ever since. He treated his beautiful/amazing ex girlfriend like trash. He would insult her all the time. My boyfriend would be around it. Although my bf didn't become a terrible abuser last year when he moved into him...he started to change. He became like a minor douche bag. He started picking up the personality traits of his friend. He would talk in that obnoxious creepy hick accent. He would low key insult me sometimes. We both just started to hate each other. September 25th of 2017 he broke up with me. He came over randomly and told me that "" we had no common interests, we barely hang out, we don't talk, he doesn't feel the same way about me, etc."" It was heartbreaking. He sat there and watched me cry and didn't have any emotion. It was so easy to just let me go. After that he said ""k well can I get my stuff back?"" We went upstairs and I tried to give him some clothes but I just started to cry. He STORMED down my steps. I was once his whole world. From September 2015-April 2016 when he was deployed I was all he had. I lived across the world and I made him feel so loved and important. Every day he looked forward to hanging out with me. He was so loving and expressed his emotions for me all the time. He was lonely. He was sad. I gave him so much. Now 2 years later this same person is treating me as if none of that happened. That night I had a 3 hour session at the recording studio. The first hour and a half I was fine. The last part was TERRIBLE. I was so hurt. I tried so hard to keep it together because someone was paying for me to be there and feature on their song. It was so difficult.  I called him that night BEGGING for him back. 45 minute conversation. The worst 45 minutes of my life. I was pacing around my neighborhood barefoot and SCREAMING. His words literally stabbed me. He was so out of love with me. It was weird. His entire tone of voice and his words were things he would never normally say. He sounded EXACTLY like his friend. It was like slowly his friend's personality slid into him and he was changed completely. The next day I blocked him on everything. I wanted nothing to do with him. Honestly, I was shocked how quickly it took me to get over him. It was all so fast. Before I knew it I was out with other people, having fun, life was great. He made a catfish account to look at my IG stories. My mom gets her hair done by his friend's ex girlfriend. She told my mom he missed me. On December 10th of 2017, I told him I missed it. It was the first time we talked in months. He came over and we got back together. From then til now we've had ups and downs. I'm VERY emotional and made it clear how upset I was. Apparently he became extremely depressed and an alcoholic. He got fed up with his friend. He said he was so lonely and missed me so much.I know it's true. He doesn't have anything going on in his life that exciting. Not that it's a a bad thing, he's just content with mediocracy. He will work a job and be a good worker. Come home. Do the same things at the same places every day. Him and his friends are almost 30 and they still skateboard at some abandoned parking lot in our lame town. It's really unattractive to me. He has no plans of trying to change this. It was so difficult to forgive him for everything. I was so angry and hurt and upset. I get so upset sometimes and can't control the words coming out of my mouth. Ooops... Anyways, from June of this year up until a few weeks ago he lived with me. The old landlord kicked them out and they were waiting to move into some other place. When he lived with me everything was great. He didn't see that friend very much and he was super nice to me. Well lately he's been becoming his friend's pet again. He's starting to talk / act like him. I haven't seen him in days. He didn't hang out with me last night to get drunk with his stupid friends. He said he would come over today but instead he went dirtbiking with his friends. He said he would come over later but nope. They're going to skateboard in someone's shitty garage. He said tomorrow he was dirtbiking again. I'm really hurt. I'm glad he's doing what he loves even though I make think it's corny but it's his communication that bothers me. He's showing no love or empathy. He sees how upset I am and how much I want to see him and he doesn't care. I want to break up with him right now. I can't take it. He's pulling me away from my dreams. I can't be with someone so hollow. I just can't because I love him too much. I want to go to LA and he will go but as he says he's ""not a dreamer."" He won't take risks like that. I would have to go first. It's just really hurting me. I don't know if I'm wrong or right, I just know the way I feel is not good and he is the cause of it. I don't understand why it doesn't phase him that he can't see me. I'm so sad and angry. I feel so frustrated and confused and let down. Anyway, thanks for reading this. It means a lot. Let me know what you think ... :) lol"
"My [27F] Relationship With BF [27M] is Breaking Down. How Do I Fix It?


Long story short, we both quit good careers to move across the country and start fresh with each other after only dating for a few months. Things didn't work out according to plan and we are both broke and depressed, and our relationship is starting to deteriorate and I don't know how to fix it without alleviating our financial pain first.

From my perspective, I do all of the hustling to find work as well as all of the cooking, cleaning, and shopping. On top of that I've started to become the scapegoat in the relationship for everything that goes wrong in my boyfriend's life. I work out a lot... he's completely stopped. He won't go to therapy because its ""too expensive"". The usual complaints. I've become really resentful, and so has he. We used to have a lot of fun together.... now I feel like everything that comes out my mouth rubs him the wrong way.

I've been down this exact same road before with my previous two relationships. I really, really want this one to work out. We have open dialogue about our issues and feelings often, but it feels like we backslide into relationship stagnation faster and faster. How do I push back and save this thing? I know relationships are cyclical but I'm worried about this period doing lasting damage.

tl/dr: Is there anyway to stop classic relationship decay?

"How should I (17M) act in my first ever relationship with my first girlfriend (16F)?


So my whole life...I've been, for the lack of better words, rather socially awkward and lonely. 

Ever since I was like 3 or 4 in pre-school, I've always been rather shy and rather scared of social interaction...and over the years, my personality type hasn't really changed at all. Of course, I'm not as innocent or as naive as my 3 year old self, but my general personality type is still the same. I was super shy as a 3 year old, I'm super shy today still. 

As such, it's no surprise I haven't had many friends over the years...now a girlfriend? If I can't even socialize normally, forget a girlfriend. 

I have had many ""casual friends"" and ""acquaintances"" before, but very few actual close friends. Almost all of my relationships feel rather formal. 

But recently, I surprisingly actually have been able to get a girlfriend. 

This certain girl would always greet me and smile at me, whereas most people just seem to not notice me. She's the type of popular girl who's super nice to everyone and gets along with everyone, so I didn't think it meant much, till one day she confessed to me. 

I was sitting alone at lunch, and she went to sit with me instead of her friends as usual, and just smiled and greeted me normally. But then she said, ""Honestly, your shyness is just adorable, and I admire how you always try your best and work so hard, even if it's something you're not good at. I really like that about you, and was wondering if you'd like to try out a relationship with me."" 

I was surprised beyond words by her confession. I never for a second saw myself as likable in that sort of way. I take 7 AP classes, which can be seen as impressive, but I have a B in 2 of them, a C in 3 of them, and a D in 2 of them. I study a heck of a lot and try my best, but I'm not able to pull off anything more than average grades, whereas some other people take 7 and still pull off all A's and B's. She herself is an AB student in AP classes, also. Basically, I didn't understand why out of all the guys in the school she chose me. 

But regardless, I accepted. I said, ""Of course, you seem like a very nice person."" She then got super happy, said thank you, and unexpectedly leaned over and pecked me on the cheek, and playfully teased me a little for turning red like a tomato. 

From then on, I've been hanging out with her and her group of friends a lot now from now on during school hours. She acts cool and casual, and we talk about stuff like work from our AP classes, TV shows, books, movies, video games, etc, whilst she holds my hand and gets a little bit closer to me to make me feel more comfortable around her. Her friends are cool with us dating, and actually are pretty fun to talk to. After school, however, I don't have a car of my own, but she sometimes drives me to her home, and there it's more personal fun just between us. Her mom and dad work all day, and her little 12 year old sister is very independent and goes out a lot, so it's usually just us. Sometimes we just watch a movie together, other times we play a sport, other times we may eat out, etc. 

It's been about 2 weeks into our relationship, and thus far it's been great! 

But being someone who hasn't had experience with just people in general (neither regular friends nor a relationship), and had a lack of affection throughout my life, this whole relationship thing is new to me, and I'm admittedly kind of skin hungry. 

I love it when she hugs me or pecks me on the cheek or whatever, and I'd like to do the same back to her...the warmth of her body is just so nice to me...but I don't want to overdo it and make her feel uncomfortable. 

When she wears shorts, she's usually like, ""Feel my legs, they're so smooth, I just shaved!"" And I just give them a quick feel, and pretend to be uninterested, when in reality, it's one of the best feelings I've ever felt, and I wish I could feel them longer...but I don't want to come off as a desperate pervert with a leg fetish. 

However, I feel my lack of touch to her may make her feel undesirable, and I don't want that type of extreme either. 

For when we conversate, we mostly just talk about casual things friends would talk about, with an ""I love you"" at the end to signify a warm goodbye. However, I want to express myself a bit more to her, say how she's the best thing that happened in my life, that I never had a true friend, especially not a female friend, till I met her. And how I love her more than just a true friend, and how she's everything to me. But I don't want to come off as sappy and extreme. But I also don't want her to not know how much I truly love her. 

Thank for you for reading, and I think I really need some tips, though our relationship has been going great thus far...I just don't want to ruin it. Plus, the better a relationship is, the worse it is when it falls. And I don't want that.
  
  ---   
  **tl;dr**: I'm in a relationship for the first time ever with a really nice girl from my high school, and though it's been going great so far, I don't want to ruin it in any way by doing something stupid. I've always been an extremely shy guy my whole life with no experience in this area, so I'm probably clueless. I was surprised she even asked me out at all, as she's much more popular and smarter than me. "
"Should I (27F) break up with my boyfriend (28M) or give him a chance with therapy?


Some back story for you all -

Me and my boyfriend have been together for 7 years now. Like all relationships everything was good in the beginning. 

Lately though he goes off on the littlest things. For example we just recently got his phone fixed. I work 3rd shift and of course he wants me to go with him so I stay up to go. Now with his warranty I guess he can get a free phone if something happened to the phone naturally. I didn’t know this at all.

He said his phone just randomly broke and like  2 seconds later I said that’s not what happened and said what really happened. Now the tech guy is really nice and asks my boyfriend if he wants to go with what he said or what I said, of course he chooses what he said. After we get his phone fixed and we leave the store he gives me a stern talking to.

Now when we get to the car he goes off. Calls me a cunt and stupid and how I’m never on his side and how I always make him look like a jackass in front of people. I try to explain that I’m tired and I thought it was funny (he tossed his phone because he thought there was a spider). He won’t hear it. 

So when we get home I try to get to some sleep because I work 2 jobs. He kicks me out of the bed, the room, the house pretty much. Says he wants to beat me. Throws a picture against the wall. I’m terrified at this point and crying so I leave. On the way out he wishes me dead and once again says he wishes he could beat me. And a whole bunch of other shit that’s hurtful. 

I recorded some of it because I didn’t feel safe and showed his mom because he tends to turn people against me. His mom says she doesn’t know what to say and talks to him then he says I’m trying to turn her against him.

The truth is I don’t think I ever been that scared ever in my life. I didn’t know what to do. He said I can finally come back to the apartment but I’m not allowed in his bed (as if I want to that at this point). 

After a day of him cooling off we finally talked about things and he agreed to get therapy. But honestly I’m not sure how I feel about it. We get into fights all the time over the smallest things and he has such a temper.

When he’s calm we can talk normally and I tell him I understand where he’s coming from but I feel like he thinks I’m always against him. I know I’m no saint by any means, I have my fair share of problems as well but I’ve been trying so hard to work on them and I feel like he doesn’t care or believe me because he has that mentality of me vs him. 

I’m scared of bad things happening because I fear what his reaction will be. 

Right now I live with him and our other roommate, a friend of his. This roommate can’t stand me. And my boyfriend says that if we do break up he’s moving out. I told him he can do whatever he wants but if I’m in this apartment with our roommate there is no promise of his side of the rent getting paid. That leaves me in an apartment with either someone who hates me, or by myself with rent a little to high for my income. 

I love him, really I do. But he needs help. But I’m not even sure if I can live like this anymore. I’m so lost on what to do, do I cut my loses and just get it done and over with? Or do I stay and he goes to therapy?

TL;DR - my boyfriend has anger issues and I’m not sure if I should stick around or not.

"How do I [21F] tell my best friend [21M] that his girlfriend [20?F] is awful for him?


My best friend and I have known each other since we were babies, we grew up together, he's like a brother to me. We usually tell people we're cousins just to explain our relationship because we have had random people in the past who don't know us say we should date, and it makes us both extremely uncomfortable. I just want to put that out there so that no one thinks this is fuelled by jealousy or whatever. 

Him and I don't hang out super often but when we do we always pick up where we left off. We grew up talking about all our problems to each other and trying to talk through issues. He's a super charismatic guy who loves engaging with strangers about random topics, he's super talented and has some awesome hobbies and is very self-driven. Despite all this he is pretty naive and has always had a tendency to think a situation is more dire than it is. 

About two years ago he met this girl, I think through a friend. From the start there were so many red flags about her. And he knew this too. He had never had a girlfriend before so I think he was kind of just excited to start something. He developed a crush on her and the two started dating. In the two and a half years that they've been together, I've never met her. I don't actually know if she knows I'm one of his closest friends. She has not met his parents, he hasn't met hers. The reason for this (from what i understand from what he's told me) was because of a class difference. He's middle class and she is very much part of my city's 1%. Regardless, there are so many things that she does that are awful to him. She gives him the silent treatment, gets mad if he goes out, is extremely jealous... there are so many other things I don't want to list but basically picture the unhealthiest relationship you can think of without being outright physically or verbally abusive and that's them. Honestly, I feel really bad for the girl because she clearly needs therapy based on what he's told me but that's just not in her world so unless she took the initiative herself, it won't happen. 

Everyone in his life has been telling him how bad this girl is for him and just in general. I have been the only one he could come and talk to about her because I never berated him for dating her. Whenever he tells me about their problems I try to guide him and explain what a healthy relationship should be like. But when talking about this with my boyfriend, he said that as his bestfriend I should tell him that this girl isn't right.

How can I bring this up to him in a nice way? I doubt whatever I say would ruin our friendship but I am a person who has difficulty bringing up hard subjects like this, especially to my friend. I want to help him get out and be able to enjoy his early 20's. Anyone been in this situation?

Hi r/relationships! 

I’ve been seeing a girl since around February. She told me I was the first person she’d ever done anything sexual with until a few months back when she revealed she had given someone a handjob, before revealing to me that it wasn’t consensual. This has played on my mind, more so that she lied to me for six months, and now I feel somewhat repulsed by what she did and can’t sleep easy without feeling lied to. She consensual kissed the guy, but she’s now revealed to me that he was 14 and she was 16, and that he forced her hand down, held it and wanked himself off with it. This really hurts me, plays on my mind and makes me feel so violated. I have a significant body count, but I was honest with her, yet she felt she couldn’t be honest with me about stuff. I don’t really know what else to say but the fact I’m so upset by it. I’m just seeking help and wondering what I should do. I took her virginity and she tells me she loves me, but I recently moved away and it does hurt me a lot. Sorry if this is a mess, I’m just a bit hysterical and hurt by it all. 

**TL:DR** - girlfriend lied to me about her past and I don’t know what to do

Thanks in advance, any advice is very much appreciated!

"My boyfriend (24M) is too supportive of me(25F)


My boyfriend and I have been friends for six years and we just started dating for one year. Things were fine for a while, but I have been having doubts since we started dating. While we have things in common and have our separate interests, I feel like he's too supportive to the point of not having his own goals. 

One example is I want to move out of the states. His reply was simply ""I don't care where we are as long as I'm with you"". Another is things like ""I'm satisfied seeing you satisfied"" and so on. 
He wants to go over the top being affectionate (like almost sappy Hallmark romance) and spoil me, but I'm not exactly the most lovey-dovey person in the world. I get frustrated because it feels like all his decisions are based on what I want and not his own or puts me on this pedestal. He keeps saying he isn't but it feels like it to me. He's had to put a restriction on himself because if you let him he will go all out on affection. But I feel like I'm being unfair to him, even though again he knows it gets over the top. I care about him, but it comes off a bit clingy sometimes.

Now I can easily probably write this off as me not being used to it. My past relationships sucked and was always an afterthought. And he never talks about himself or his plans/wants. 

It's been really weighing me down lately. I care about him but I don't know if I can keep dealing with this. Us getting together tore our friend circle apart and is just now getting put back together. If we broke up, he'd fall apart and never hang with me again, and I'm afraid my friends would hate me too after all the drama we put them through. I don't know what to do it's so stressful.

TL;DR boyfriend seems like he has no ambitions of his own, I'm suffocating and feeling like a POS over it. 

If you have any questions or need some extra detail I will reply. Thank you"
"I [24M] told my [27F] gf of 6 months that I loved her. She didn't take it well.


LDR couple, we've already met in person and have been having a pretty wonderful relationship. 6 month anniversary today so I did a song, food, etc and overall made it a pretty good one. Mood was great, and the last thing was a handwritten card with the words ""I love you"" at the end. 

She kind of took it like she just got hit by a nuclear bomb and pretty bluntly said ""I don't feel that way about you."" She's normally fairly blunt and doesn't have a way with words but WOWZERS that felt like a punch to the heart. But that's fine ya know, I understand. Someone always has to say it first in a relationship, I understood the possibility of her not experiencing that same feeling.

I think I just expected her to say something along the lines of ""I need more time to think about my feelings."" or ""I'm not sure if I feel that way now but maybe in the future with more time."" That would've been much nicer. I wanted to just say it and go on with our activities but it pretty much ended the night with her saying she needs time to think. But she already told me that ""She doesn't feel that way about me"" not going to lie that is pretty rough on my heart reddit. We talked a tiny bit during it and to her she feels it as some massive exclamation of commitment, eventually marriage, and something along the lines of spending the rest of your lives together. She said she liked me more than any of her previous boyfriends but doesn't know if she loves me or what love feels like in that case. But regardless my heart still kinda took a beating from the repeated ""I don't feel that way about you"" when I was trying to change back into fun activities. She explained her thoughts were along the line of, if she doesn't feel that way now is she just leading me on? etc


While I view it more as this feeling of really enjoying time with your SO. Waking up and every single day the highlight of the day ends up being talking to that SO. To the point where it just becomes ingrained in your daily lives and you realize that you love them. It's just a feeling. There's nothing concrete or obligations required, it's just a constant daily feeling of how much you enjoy spending time with your SO.

So yeah idk what to reddit. I didn't expect her to be guaranteed to say it back, but at the same time I didn't really expect the cold harsh ""I don't feel that way about you."" There's obviously some disconnect in our interpretations of the word love but yeah. Makes me feel like I made some massive mistake saying it but I've felt that way for months and although everyone has their own pace 6 months in didn't feel horrible? I mean doesn't everyone eventually just say it? Key note I'm okay with her having the possibility of loving me in the future. Obviously if she'll never feel that way then holy shit that's a relationship bomb. Thoughts are more or less swarming so definetly could use some wise words.

**tl;dr I said I loved her 6 months in. She said she doesn't feel that way about me. I expected her not to feel the same way, but the bluntness hurt. Feels like my heart got hit by a semi-truck. Ended our 6 month aniv date, feel like I dropped a bomb on her or something. **"

"Me (20M) unsure how to pursue her (19F)


I guess I'll just jump right in with explaining how we got from where it started to where I'm at now:

Back in junior high, which was a long time ago, there was this girl that caught my attention, and like all first crushes it was pretty cringey. At the time, I thought the best way to tell this person I was interested was to send paragraphs of garbage online messages almost on a daily basis. (They might as well have been replaced with lorem ipsum dolor sit amet...). Obviously she got fed up with this at a certain point, and blocked communications, which is totally fair now that I look back on it.  I've just been an idiot and never actually talked to her much in person, so we never really even got to develop a friendship. (I'm still blocked to this day. Of course, there's her university email but I will not even go there)

&amp;#x200B;

Anyways, high school comes around and I mostly forget about her, since we went to different schools but fast forward a few years, we're in university, I find out that we're both studying in the same faculty. Although we're doing different specializations, I do end up seeing her every now and again. Recently, I finally decided to say hi, and we had a nice, casual conversation, the kind when you meet a friend after a couple years, and ask what they're up to. So, she is a cool person, because I would think that after being annoyed to the point of needing to block me, she wouldn't want to ever speak again. Anyways, I thought that doing this would bring some sort of closure but instead I spent the next night unable to sleep (ok, I did sleep but it was very light and almost not much deep sleep) thinking about what-if situations, which is not ideal when it's midterm season. I have ..checked out other women but I noticed that I don't think of the same things as when I think about her. For some reason when I think of this crush, all I can imagine is playing with her hair, resting my head on her lap, looking deep into her eyes, rubbing foreheads, or spooning. This kind of confuses me but I guess that's why I haven't pursued other relationships as of yet.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm not sure why after so long I didn't let her go but I gave it some thought recently, as I have matured ever so slightly since then (7 years can do that. Yikes. 7 years is a looong time, at least for someone my age), and I realized what my problem may be: I never actually got to know her as a person. I spent all these years just fantasizing about her, with only the knowledge that she's smart af, and hella cute. (At least in my opinion, I had friends tell me she's ugly). So I've spent all this time just thinking why doesn't she like me when I've done literally nothing. Yikes.

I wouldn't say that I'm socially awkward, even though the field that I'm in is a circlejerk. I don't find myself acting awkward around my few female friends, but at the same time, I treat them mostly the same as my bro friends, which definitely would not fly with the types of girls who go into arts. But then, like any male nerd I guess, I find myself sometimes panicking if I see her unexpectedly, but then also having to make a conscious effort to stop myself from staring at her.

&amp;#x200B;

At least I guess, at this point, I've identified my problem, which is I need to try to get to know her better, in person. I'm not really sure how to do this though because I've never asked anyone out before, and now, there's this added complication of having a not so sweet past memory. Tbh she does seem like a cool person, since we were able to have such a casual conversation, but I can't help but think that I don't want to bother her again. Most people, especially those going into STEM are there to study and better themselves (including me) (There are also other thoughts that I'd like to think don't matter, like worrying about different skin colour, and my parents not approving, wondering how different reality might be from what I'm imagining if we actually get together, or worrying about not being able to dedicate enough time to her, even though literally every couple I know has said that it is understood that the workload is so heavy, that they end up studying together on Friday nights instead of going out or doing whatever couples normally do). (At the same time, I'm not sure how a relationship would work with my parents, who are fairly restrictive, especially since I'm the older sibling in the relationship. I can definitely see asking to have her over for any reason, including studying be a big no-no, and even though I am an adult, I am expected to be home by a certain time, especially when I'm expected to be studying. It could be worse I guess, at least now that I'm older, they would be cool with going to the theatre or eating out but going out to drink is only .. tolerated if it's after an exam or something.)

&amp;#x200B;

Anyways, next time we meet, I'm thinking of asking to buy her a drink after midterms are over. Is that normal? How would I bring that up in a conversation? Do I ask for her number? I'm worried that she might be concerned about me spamming messages, given our brief past. What if she asks if I'm asking for a date. Would that be considered a date? (Is it weird for a guy to prefer Smirnoff ice over beer😂) I'm not sure if I should say it is a date, but I think asking to buy a drink after midterms would be an opportunity to talk to her some more, and to get to know her better. Maybe from there I would then have to decide how to actually ask her out. If I ever even reach that point. I'm not sure what a good date would be.  Would that mean going to an expensive restaurant? Would that mean doing the cliché thing which is to go to the movies? How would I find out what she would want to do? Or would I need to be slower, and do more ""hangouts"" as friends before transitioning to being a couple. How does that transition happen?

&amp;#x200B;

I don't know, there are so many questions going through my head, since I have literally no experience in this regard, but here's to hoping my next encounter with her will go well,🙏

&amp;#x200B;

**TL;DR** Crushed on this girl in junior high, we're in university now and I still haven't forgotten about her. When I was \~14, I flooded her messages with garbage text. I wanna see where things will go if I ask her out but I need advice with doing so, and possibly also with focusing on my studies in spite of my curiosity/affinity to this individual

Hi all,
So I recently mentioned to my girlfriend (of ~1 year) that I would like to go explore this really interesting land mark with her, and today she went to it with her friend (a guy, for reference, but his gender doesn’t bother me outside of the irrational primal twinge of jealousy which could be amplifying my feelings on this issue). Recently I’ve had issues with her making our relationship a priority, and I’ve tried to approach this with her calmly and maturely, but she’s under a lot of pressure right now with work and school so I kind of let it go. I mentioned to her today kind of off-hand that I had hoped to explore that with her, and that’s why I mentioned it, but she said she didn’t remember me ever mentioning to her. Again, this isn’t the first time something like this has happened, and it’s less about not exploring a landmark to me and more about her ignoring/forgetting/not finding me? our relationship? my feelings? important. How should I approach communicating this to her without it coming off as needy/over the top? (as she is still under a lot of pressure)"

"I (23F) am trying to reconnect with my long lost father (60s/M). Seeking advice on how to go about this


Hi y'all. I'm not entirely sure how to start, so I guess I'll start at the beginning. TL;DR at bottom.

Up until I was 7 years old, I lived with both parents. They were (seemingly) happy together. There was no history of violence or abuse, although I do recall frequent verbal fights toward the end of their marriage. I have nothing but numerous fond memories of my father, and the experiences we had together have heavily influenced my current hobbies and even my career path. We were two peas in a pod, and I seem to have picked up a lot of his personality traits and interests. 

Unfortunately, when they divorced, my mother and I moved to a different continent. I missed him so much, but it became so hard to keep in contact, what with time zone differences, phone shyness, and negative talk about my father coming out of my mother's mouth. I lost touch, he lost touch. I was a child and obviously didn't know how to handle the situation.

Over the next decade, we managed to each other twice -- once in my city, once in his. Both times it was awkward as we really didn't know each other anymore. And still, cue radio silence for most of the year with some conversations here and there.

Now, as an adult, I'd like to reconnect. I'd like us to have a relationship, be closer, see each other more often. Ideally have him be present for big life events. He seems interested as well, as the frequency of our chats has increased and I can hear it in his voice. But I don't know how to converse or what to talk about, and I know very little about his life but I feel too shy to just bombard him with questions.

"Still in love with best friend (19M) and don't know how to tell him


I started kinda dating my best friend over the summer.  We spent every day together and told each other personal things.  At first we would just go on runs together or play with our dogs, but then we started doing things like go on dates.  We began developing feelings for each other rather quickly and he told me after a couple weeks of hanging out over the summer.  My friend had suffered through some severe depression and even tried to commit suicide, he confided in me a lot of personal things and I think I was a good emotional support friend to confide in for him.  I fell in love with him within weeks of us hanging out again (we rekindled our friendship this year after not talking for awhile).  I'm not sure if he actually fell in love with me too, but after three weeks of us being more than ""friends"" (we only madeout and talked about being more physical, but then stopped there) he told me he needed us to cut the physical part of our relationship out because it was too emotionally draining.  He told me he didn't want to put me through his depression, since he felt like he wasn't in a stable mindset.  I totally respected him for telling me this, but after we decided to just be friends he kinda gave me mixed signals and asked to makeup with me after and told me he missed me and that he always enjoyed being with me.  This prevented me from moving on because I held onto this idea that we would get back together and I could help him with his depression.  Fast-forward a couple months and now we are both in college together again and I see him occasionally passing classes and I brought him ice cream one day when he wasn't feeling good.  We text on and off and I miss him terribly.  All I want to do is tell him I love him and just want to be with him.  I'm scared that he doesn't reciprocate any of these feelings back though, because he hasn't told me otherwise or seemed flirty with me anymore.  I enjoy his company and I miss spending time together.  I know he is still on his antidepressant medication and wouldn't want to jeopardize his mentality in any way, but I also see him not trying to get better and it pains me to watch.  

I wish I knew if I could move on or not.  Because I know I would drop everything to be with this guy, but I don't know if he feels the same.  However, I met this other boy, who is two years older than me and also goes to the same college as me and my ""ex"", and he asked me on a date last week.  I really didn't know if I should go, since I still want to be with my best friend, but I decided I should try to put myself back out there.  I ended up going on a hike with this guy and he seemed into me and asked to make me dinner next week.  He seems totally nice and we have some mutual friends, who think we would be a good match.  I want to be happy in my next relationship, whomever that may be, but I cannot help, but think about my ""ex"" (we never officially were boyfriend and girlfriend).

&amp;#x200B;

tl;dr: I am in love with my ex and I don't know if I should tell him in order to move on or to try to get back together with him.  I also went on a date with a different guy last week and he seems super sweet and into me, but I keep thinking about my ex.  I have this huge feeling that he doesn't feel the same way though and it'll ruin all my chances of maintaining our friendship."

"I [22M] dont enjoy my relationship [23F] anymore and have a strong desire to have sex with other girls.


We met eachother off work, talked a little and started dating. I figured out she was already dating someone else at the same time, got pissed and told her to leave me alone. She told me she liked me more and was going to break up with him to be with me. I caught her a couple of times still talking / being with him and she told me it was because she fell a little in love without wanting it and so was slowly breaking up with him. We had allot of fights over that part and actually ended up being together because i wanted her out of the shitty situation she told me she was and not me really falling in love and liking her. I was working my way into the marine corps for a while already before even meeting her and so 6 months into our relationship the training was going to start (what she all knew before started dating me). In this time we also started living together. She really had made me a ""mess"" in between that time because of all the things that happend (the fighting, me catching her ""cheating"" again etc) and me not being able to mentally focussed on my work anymore i had quit the marines after a couple of weeks (i also didnt felt right about douing it anymore, because of a huge emotional rollercoaster and mental confusion about the past couple of months). So u can kinda say i stopped working where i wanted to for over years because of her. After all of that i started working at a callcenter which was very stressfull work what i never thought would be a problem, yet still somehow i felt like i became more sensitive for stress then i ever used to be because of ""our relationship""i (still) think, because of all the fighting we had (we fought allot,like at least 4x per week and mostly also heavy yelling fights) and i really think that all that made me mentally change and idk if i can call it positive in the end now it has become some less but still from time to time. At the time i had that job there was a girl who liked me and i liked her attention so we had some little kinda flirting talks on work. After a little while i had a fight again with my gf and i went out the house at night when she was at work and texted my colleague to hang out with her, we walked outside talked about the fight i had and i ended up kissing her and asking her to have sex with me which we in the end didnt had but what i somehow really wanted with her. I told my gf about everything and felt really really bad and heartbroken about it, in the end she had forgiven me and we managed to work it all out. Now we are 2 years together and i feel like my relationship is more stress and fighting then fun and love, i have a very strong feeling that i want to have sex with other girls, because the sex we have is just so u get the climax and thats it. I find other girls way more attractive then my own. If i see a attractive girl on the street i sometimes start to feel sexual arroused already and start thinking about how it would be. I know its bad and i shouldnt but i feel very tempted to do it so,and i know that if i get a chance to i probably would even tho what happend the last time.. and i think i want to just because of how my relationship feels. I feel like there are allot of things i dont enjoy like i used to when i was single, from listening music to gaming and training, and even just relaxing and douing nothing dosnt feel really pleasant anymore. I tried breaking up with her a couple of times because of heavy fighting again and me just not wanting to do it all anymore but when i really had my stuff ready to leave i fellt so heartbroken and sad that i couldnt do it in the end. Sometimes i really feel like i wanna be alone again and do everything my own way and feel free which i thought back then was the best time of my life except from the part of feeling alone sometimes. Now i dont really feel pleasure in my relationship and i think about all of this pretty much everyday. We talked about things what we need to work on before but never really ended up douing anything with it. And so i dont know if it ever will work at all. Should i still keep trying or just break up and go my own way? I hope anyone can help me with advice, thanks in advance. Im sorry for my bad english i hope u can understand it. If i need to explain something please tell me i will try my best.

TL:DR - i [22M] dont feel attracted to my gf [23F] anymore,i dont enjoy things that i used to like when i was single such as listening music gaming, and even training. And i have a very very strong desire to have sex with other girls and know if i had the chance to i would do."

"I [24M] want to marry a girl [24F] after dating her for less than 2 weeks


Get ready for a tale:


I’ve known of this girl for about 7 years. We have a bunch of mutual friends. One of my best friends even was her step brother for about a year and lived with her. 


Over the last few years she has had two kids and has wound up a single mother of two wonderful little boys. I was engaged for a while and ended up single after it imploded. 


A few months ago I reached out VIA Facebook and asked her if she wanted to get drinks. Her guard was very high but I stayed my intentions and understanding of her situation. Eventually she came around and had tickets for a really cool event, so we went. 


I fell in love with her that first night. We discussed what a relationship would look like under the assumption that we do have a happy ever after. She fell in love with me that night as well. 


Over the next few days we got to know each other as much as you can in a weeks time. Her qualities are so incredibly attractive to me and I know she’s not lying because I’ve had so many people verify that’s who she really is. I’ve told her all my dirt and she’s shared her dirt with me. I’ve never had some accept for who I am (mental illness- OCD). And she’s thrilled she found a good father figure for her two boys as the dads really aren’t in the picture. 


I brought up the concept of marriage because we were both engaged at one point and we both agreed that we knew what we both wanted out of a partner and that each other had those qualities. She joked around about eloping so I asked her if she was serious. She said she was joking but she would marry me in a instant, so we agreed that if we still felt the same way in 6 months we’d pull the trigger and get hitched. 


Later on that day she jokingly stated that she might not be able to wait 6 months and I agreed. So, we applied for a marriage license to have for when we decided to elope. It was at that time I realized we had essentially gotten engaged. 


So, the next day I took my Ex’s engagement ring to the story and traded it for a newer better ring and went over to her house and dropped down on one knee and said, “this is the craziest damn thing I’ve ever done but I want you to know I’m serious. Let’s get married.”


She said yes. Then, as we were laying there she said wanted to marry me as quickly as we could and I agreed I didn’t want to wait. So we figured this Friday would be a good day to get married over both of our lunch breaks at the courthouse. I asked her, “how do you know this is legit.” And she replied, “this is the most natural thing I’ve ever felt.” I replied, “I have a significant amount of mental obsessions that I’ve gone through an insane amount of therapy to get control of none of them arise in regards to her and that has never happened with a girl before and that’s how I know it’s legit on my side.” 


Question: do you think it’s possible for two people to find legitimate love in two weeks and move forward on it? I know exactly what I’m looking for and she knows exactly what she’s looking for and we’re both it for each other. I agree that giving it time couldn’t hurt, but it feels so incredibly natural and right. What’re your thoughts?


TL;DR: met the most incredible person I’ve ever met and we’re getting within two weeks of meeting. "

"I need help/advice


TL;DR at the bottom.

I (28F) really need help with trying to figure out what to do with my husband (35 M).

My husband and I have been married 4 years. We're a blended family. 5 kids brought together. None between the two of us. We've had our ups and downs just like anyone else. I'm not a very intimate person. He's known this from the beginning. I've been working on it over the years. Now here's my issue: I caught him on not one, but two hook-up apps. He's currently away from home for his job. He has only been away for less than two weeks! He lied at first about downloading them. Then fesses up and tells me he did it because in his words, ""If you don't want me, someone will."" He's referring to me not being intimate by saying that. He kept apologizing saying he deleted them immediately after and didn't sign up. I don't believe him. This also isn't the first time this has happened. He's only apologizing because he got caught. Who knows if he has actually gone out and done anything with anyone at this point.
We both have a lot invested in this marriage. But he knows the whole reason I left my ex was because I caught him multiple times talking to other women. I know I'm better than this. I know I don't deserve this. But I don't know what to do! Please help. Any advice is appreciated.

TL;DR: Husband got caught on 2 hook-up sites. Denied it, then fessed up once he realized he got caught."
"I (24/f) make a lot less than my boyfriend (25/m) but bills are split


I was making pretty good money and lived at home until last year so I have $10k in savings but just recently started nursing school and cut my hours to about 8-10 a week at $17/hr. My boyfriend is finishing his first year as a firefighter making \~$85k. Before that he hardly made enough to cover bills so didn't have much in savings. 

Our rent is $560 each, and he's trying to save up for a house/our future. His family isn't able to ever contribute money if in a hard spot, and he comes from a VERY poor background. My family has told me on multiple occasions that they'll help me if needed. 

I'm able to pay my share of the rent and my own bills (so with rent \~$800/month while only making maybe $500/month), but my savings will quickly dwindle. I've tried to talk to him about it but it usually gets a little heated. He's told me that if absolutely necessary he could help me out with rent, which is sweet of him, but thinks I should try to pull my own weight despite making less than a quarter what he does... I understand this is his first year making that much but it still seems like more than enough money to me. Heck, people support families with that income. 

Part of me wants him to be like ""babe you're in school don't worry about rent or food I got it""- is that unfair of me?? How do I go about discussing this with him? I DO NOT expect him to completely support me nor do I live anywhere near a high-maintenance lifestyle. "

Me and this friend have been calling each other basically everyday since June. We've gotten pretty close and comfortable with each other. We hang out all the time and I love being around him. I couldn't ask for a better friend. Last night during our usual call he confessed he's started to get feelings for me. Whenever a boy has confessed to me before I'd always start to panic because I've never felt attraction towards boys and would have to find a way to tell them without outing myself. But this time I just felt really happy. I told him to let me think about it and im starting to think I have feelings for him, too. Whenever I see him I get this excited fluttering in my chest and run to him. I've been having the urge to hug him or hold his hand, but I've been scared to. I always try to be close to him and he says he's been doing that as well. I want to tell him I feel the same way, but this is the first time I've ever felt anything for a boy. I'm scared that I'll confess, then he'll try to get close to me and I'll feel that panic I did with all the others. I really don't want to hurt him so what should I do?

"I [23/M] am in love with my flatmate [23/F] and my jealously is ruining our relationship


We met two years ago when we were thrown in to student accommodation together and have been inseparable ever since. We cook and eat together, hang out every night together, have a lot of mutual friends, the whole thing. 

I moved to this city a year before her and in the last three years I've slowly overcome my social anxiety, gotten into better shape, dress better, look after myself more, stopped smoking weed every day, have self confidence now - grown up, basically. Much of this was done with her. 

I started to develop feelings for her over the summer but kept quiet as we had just signed a lease that doesn't end until July 2019 and I figured since we'd lived together for years before and I didn't feel this way that things would work themselves out. Plus, I knew for a fact that the love was unrequited as people often confuse us for a couple and we'd talked jokingly about it a few times. She was always very quick to dismiss the idea.

About two months ago, she started dating / sleeping with a guy which never bothered me before - in fact, sometimes she'd have a guy over and we'd hang out and smoke together without batting an eyelid - but this time was different... This dude starting hanging around and sometimes they *wouldn't* have sex and he'd make dinner etc like it was a relationship. That fizzled out (problem solved, right?! Wrong.) but my face would betray me whenever she talks about guys/sex/dating etc and I could tell she knew was something wrong. I have never felt such strong emotional pain as I lay in bed chain-rolling joints with headphones in at full blast to try and distract myself from the girl I love getting her brains fucked out next door. I couldn't sleep, would have to leave in the middle of the night to go for a walk cos I simply couldn't be next door to it anymore.

A few weeks later of our relationship being tense / strained I finally told her why. She's not in a good place anyway (failing classes, developed a weed habit which I can't help but feel a little guilty for, has panic attacks and comes home from work early etc) and I knew it would fuck her up but I felt like I had to say something so we could find a way forward - maybe give me a heads up and I'll stay at a friends for the night or something. I know this was a selfish act but I had to choose between her mental health and mine as I couldn't bear to be in the flat or be around her knowing that at the end of the evening we'd go into our seperate bedrooms, wouldn't have any other girls over hoping she wouldn't have any dudes over and so on. 

She wasn't mean about it and told me directly that it'll never happen - she loves me as a brother and so on. It'll be very tough on her if she loses me but I'm a man, not a teddy bear, and unfortunately I have to put myself first. Since then we've had one night hanging out together that was just like the old times, a couple of arguments, a few frank discussions, and lots of avoiding each-other. I feel immensely guilty and so does she and it has definitely had a negative impact on her, making her depressive spell way way worse. 

I can't afford to move out any time soon and neither can she. There's a third flatmate in the mix [21/M] - my friend from Uni - but he just sits in his room all day playing xbox. I'm in my final year of University and haven't been taking my studies seriously for the last three years, my odds of finishing are already extremely slim and hers are basically non-existent (sounds harsh but she has yet to attend a class this semester, even before I told her how I feel) and basically everything is shit and overwhelming. 

My question is: in your experience, is there a way out of this that ends well for both of us? Or should I just cut my losses and start saving to move out ASAP? 

**TL;DR Hopelessly in love with my very close friend / roommate to the point where I don't enjoy being at home and my already difficult (self inflicted) studies are suffering. I feel guilt for ruining our relationship and making her depressive spell worse, but emotional pain if I did nothing. What do I do?**

"My [26F] online friend [24M] is on meds and has a therapist for depression but he's still very suicidal and constantly forces me into these situations where I am stuck there for hours begging him not to kill himself.


Lemme just say in advance that I know how toxic and unhealthy this friendship is for me, and even for him since he is so dependent on me for his happiness and survival. I pretty much know what I should do, which is tell him to fuck off completely, but I also don't know how to do that without worrying he's going to commit suicide.  

I've known him for a few years, and he had an insanely rough childhood. He's severely depressed and suicidal, but is on medication and goes to a therapist at least once a week.. it doesn't seem to be making any difference though. He's also on Xanax and some other med for his PTSD.  

He has feelings for me, and I've told him a thousand times I am not interested. He always begs me to hang out with him one on one but when I do he traps me there and guilt trips me and begs me to stay. I leave anyway because it pisses me off and basically barely or don't at all talk to him until I get over it. Now he has apologized and begs me to hang out but promised no trapping.  

I say no to him because 1 on 1 hanging out with him ""as friends"" isn't just ""as friends"" when he has feelings for me and it also makes him beg me even harder to hang out the next time and it feels too much like committing to something for my liking. Then he gets sad and withdraws, then when he comes back he makes extremely suicidal comments like ""man, i'm sick. well, hopefully i choke on my own vomit in my sleep! maybe i'll go out and get some over the counter insulin because when you OD on it you just fall asleep lol"" or saying he's gonna kill himself ""for real this time"" and disappearing afterwards which basically tethers me to the computer/phone worried he's gonna kill himself.  

I also spend this time begging him to call someone, call the cops on himself, go to the hospital, call his roommate at work, call his therapist, anything. This is seriously exhausting and stressful -- not only am I not a therapist or a doctor but I already spend a lot of time making sure I'm not depressed since I have depression too (and am medicated for it).  

I know I need to stop talking to him and I do tell him how unfair it is to me and he agrees and then goes back to doing it all over again. But I'm worried he's gonna do it if I tell him to fuck off.. I know it's not my responsibility and if he does it it isn't my fault but it's still hard for me to fully accept that.  

I could really use some help with what to say to him exactly so he can't just manipulate and work his way out of it. Even if you just share your experience with similar situations I'd really appreciate it.  

**TL:DR;** Extremely suicidal friend won't take no for an answer for anything (including his romantic advances) and constantly puts me in situations where I have to beg him not to kill himself for hours. I need to cut him out of my life, no matter what happens, but it's hard when I'm worried he's going to kill himself. Looking for your experiences and advice, especially in regards to what to say to him.  "

We have been in a long distance relationship for 7 months as she studies abroad, we spent the entire summer together but now shes back to college in Sweeden.
Yesterday we had a discussion about a silly topic and she uses to get all worked up on everything, while we were both going back and forward with this she starts screaming, just screaming ""AAA"" meaning that she don't wanna hear what I wanna say because she felt that I wasn't listening to her in the first place, after she had screamed I snapped a bit and told her in a bit harshly manner that I dont like it when she screams like that when we're arguing, we re adults and we should come to a conclusion keeping normal voice levels, she has done the same thing in the past, there were arguments that ended with her screaming, not wanting to hear about it and I coped with it, moved forward, but now I couldnt.
After that, the entire day shes been cold as ice, I apologized to her for raising my voice as I took the blame for not listening properly to what she had to say, I tend to do that, and I aknowledge that.

We had fights in the past, she has been cold in the past, but really would like to hear some thoughts and opinions on what should I do, I generally feel so sorry about this as usually I am pretty calm and consider myself being the bigger man in an argument.

"My [21F] boyfriend [21M] was flirting with a coworker.


I found out last night that my SO of four years has been flirting with one of his coworkers from messages on his phone. Neither of us is secretive so we regularly go through each other's phones when we're bored. 

I confronted him about it and after a while he told me he liked her and he wanted to see if she liked him. He said he wasn't planning on leaving me or touching her and that he knew it was stupid.

 He said that it had nothing to do with me and he still loves me and wants to be with me still but says he feels like he loves me less than he used to because we don't spend as much time together. We live together but we both work a lot so I can see why he'd feel that way. 

I told him I would stay with him if he was sure he was done seeking out other women. He said he wanted to take a break so we could both see other people and I told him I wouldn't date him again if we split and then he changed his mind saying he doesn't need a break. 

We're still together and I'm trying really hard to get back to a normal place but he's distant and said he feels empty. I don't know what that means and he doesn't know how to explain it. 

He was the one flirting but it seems like he's having a harder time with all of this and I don't know why.

I keep asking him if he's sure he wants to try with our relationship and I told him that if he wants out he just needs to be honest about it but he keeps insisting he wants to be with me.

I don't know what to do. I feel like I made the right decision since I feel he is genuinely remorseful but I'm trying to get us to a good place and I don't know what to do.

Tldr; boyfriend of 4 years flirted with a coworker he likes, loves me less, but wants to be together still. I agreed but now he feels empty and I don't know what to do."

"[M19] Strange relationship dynamic over long distance with [F18]


They are Korean (I am British) and attend an all girls boarding school in London. I used to live near and we knew one another but not too well them but started university so have moved up to Edinburgh. 

&amp;#x200B;

I was on tantan (Chinese tinder) and we saw each other and started talking again and decided to date. So far its going quite well, we have an unspoken mutual understanding of boundaries and each others own personal lives (this is very important for me as I am quite independent and need personal space; so I like being long distance and there is no constant obligation) and we have mutual interests and generally get along really well. I also trust her completely. 

&amp;#x200B;

So heres is the weird dynamic part. 

1) They will start university in 2 years (Late birthday and came to UK late). They really really want to go to University college London (and will likely get in) with but other choices being Glasgow and Edinburgh. If I transferred (if I got accepted) I would start  September/October 2019 whereas they would have only just started applying and start in 2020. So unless she hears back from the offer before I would start in 2019 we could end up with me going to London and her going to Scotland.... or me staying in Scotland and her in London. Both our courses would be 4 years so long distance over such a long time seems less appealing 

&amp;#x200B;

2) Financially; her parents both own big companies in Korea and are extremely wealthy whereas I am just kinda average. This feels like a strange dynamic and while her parents are fine with this... im not sure how this will play out in the future. 

&amp;#x200B;

3) She is attractive but I know in terms of appearance I could do better. I really don't want to bugger this up but I know deep down I am not taking as seriously as I should be based on these facts.

&amp;#x200B;

Im on the fence when I think about being single but also how great this relationship could be but the difficulties it could face.  "
"My (20F) boyfriend (22M) is on a vacation and is staying with a friend (22F) who has had feelings for him for years


My boyfriend (of 2 years) is gone on a 4 day vacation this weekend (I couldn't go with him as we are currently long distance) and is staying with a female friend who has had feelings for him since high school and has confessed her attraction to him the past. He's aware that she still has feelings for him and chose to stay with her on this trip, in her apartment. He had other friends in the same city however they live much further away and getting a hotel or AirBnB would be expensive. 

Some background on my experience with this girl; I've never met her but last Christmas she wanted to fly out to Canada to meet us on our trip which I found very strange as it was a couples trip, on that same trip my boyfriend posted a picture of us together online and soon after she viewed it, she drunk called him telling him how much she loves him. To which he replied ""I can't say I love you back because my girlfriend is here"". 

Another friend of his claimed that this woman made advances on him when he was in a relationship and told me she has a habit of wanting taken men. 

Ever since she found out he'd be staying with her on this trip she has been facetiming him multiple times per day and has planned many activities for them to do together such as Apple picking, food markets and dinner, despite the fact that he's going on vacation to visit other friends, not her. He turned down all these things and said he could only spend one day with her. 

We're also ending our long distance soon and he's coming out to live in my city for a few months and she attempted to convince him not to do this, that he shouldn't move so far away to be with ""some girl"" (referring to me, the girl he's been with for almost 2 years). 

I feel very uncomfortable with the way she acts around my boyfrind and I don't think she respects my relationship with him. He knows I'm not comfortable with this and knew in advance that it would put a lot of strain on our trust (which has been deeply damaged in the past).

Do any of you have any insight on this situation or advice? Or just anything i can do to stay sane for the next 4 days? 

**TL;DR*** Boyfriend of 2 years is staying with a female friend who's had feelings for him since high school, has no respect for my relationship with him and has made advances on taken men in the past, I'm concerned with his choice to stay with her despite knowing all of this and looking for advice on what to do in this situation.

"I [31/F] want to learn how to be in a healthy relationship and become a better partner. How can I accomplish this?


I \[31/F\] got out of a relationship about two months ago and I've gotten fed up with getting my heart broken. You can ready my post history to get a sense of how toxic the relationship was. I don't want to place blame on my ex because we were both terrible to each other. It's hard to admit but I was mean to him sometimes when I started becoming resentful. I should have showed him I appreciated him more and that I loved him. I also want to build enough courage to walk away from relationships that are harming me.

&amp;#x200B;

I briefly went on Tinder and POF to help bandage the pain of the breakup, but it was making me feel more depressed. No one on there really peaked my interest and I wasn't able to find a connection.

&amp;#x200B;

I decided to take this time to focus on myself and improve myself physically and mentally. I want to learn ways to be better in my future relationships so I can be in a happy, healthy relationship or walk away when I know the relationship is toxic.

&amp;#x200B;

I've been watching Youtube videos about attachment theory and reading Mark Manson articles. I was also thinking of reading books about better relationships. I'm just worried that this isn't enough to change behaviors that are engrained in me. What other steps can I take to help me change for the better? Counselling? Anyone else gone through similar changes? Thank you."
"Me [27 M] with my girlfriend [29 F] have been talking for six months and met once. We've broken up over a stupid fight but remain friends. She's leaving the country permanently in December. At the same she wants distance until she leaves. I'm afraid I'll never see her again. What should I do?


We broke up because she chose to see her friend over me, having substituted our date (but admitted this was a mix up). I think there was a misunderstanding, and I told her how I felt. 

My worst fear came to realisation, and she said I was causing her too much stress over this issue and that with everything personal going on in her life she couldn't handle me having this fight (this was our second one). I told it wasn't a fight, I was just expressing how I felt, but I think she took it the wrong way.

She told me she was done with whatever we had, but wanted to remain friends. She texted me the day after our break up (which surprised me) and we talked like normal over whatsapp. She then told me that she only contacted me to show that she wasn't going to disappear from my life, and that it was okay to talk once in a while with her (as things wouldn't ever be the same again).

I replied that I was under no illusion and that I wasn't even going to message her (secretly I was planning to after about a week).

Now I'm left feeling lonely as hell. I talked and texted this girl several times a day. I miss her voice already.

What should I do? She's going to leave permanently in December, and I'm afraid I'll never see her again. 

She's honestly one of the most beautiful and forgiving people out there. We've both been through a lot of trauma in our lives and I think that's how we managed to click so quickly.

What do I do? Should I call her in about a weeks time to catch up with her?

TL:DR Girlfriend and I had our second fight, and she broke it off. She wants to remain friends, and so do I, but since she's leaving in December I'm afraid I'll never see her again. Should I call her in about a weeks time to see what she's up to? Ideally I'd like to kick start whatever we've had but it sounds like she's given up. I wouldn't mind remaining friends, but the loneliness of suddenly not talking to her everyday is getting to me."
"I (30F) have let down my friend (33F) because I don't have any emotional bandwidth for her even though this time the crisis is real.


Hi all.

About 5 years ago I moved to an east cost city with my then-boyfriend to attend graduate school. For context I am an introvert with a disorganized/avoidant attachment style due to a childhood spent parent-ified (parental mental illness and drug addiction). I struggled to make friends and connect with others in my grad program, who often seemed more on the mommy/marriage track and more interested in getting out of class early than learning the material (or, as I saw it, getting their money's worth on a six-figure education). However I did meet one girl with whom I got on well and who helped share the at-times overwhelming workload. We also remained friends through graduation and in the first few years of practicing in our new careers. Due to her own family difficulties and a seeming pattern of unstable relationships, I often felt to be in a sort of parent-like role with her as well, trying to offer good support through as she seemingly tripped from crisis to crisis, some minor (all manner of unsuitable crushes and relationships) and others more major (unwanted pregnancy and abortion, legitimate family issues, getting fired from her job). She was also a good person to have around as my own life grew more difficult and complicated, from my amicable-but-still-difficult split with my boyfriend of 5 years to my brother's hospitalization and bipolar diagnosis. She was never able to provide a lot of emotional coaching but was always more than willing to come over, get me high, and get me out of the house in an attempt to get me out of my head. I always felt I was giving better than I was getting but I also am not great at building new friendships (my nearest and dearest are all friends of at least 10 years). When she decided life in our frigid east coast city had grown too difficult, she opted to move back to her hometown on the west coast, I helped her pack up her life and she and I drove across the country to bring her car and belongings back to her hometown. Somewhere along the way-- forgive me, I don't remember exactly when-- my friend received a borderline personality disorder diagnosis that helped put into perspective some of her erratic tendencies, short-sighted decisionmaking, and just overall self-centeredness. 

I am notoriously bad at staying in touch with my long-distance friends due to phone-based anxiety and lord knows they have had to be patient and forgiving with me. My now-west-coast friend was as well, calling or texting me relatively often to drop me a line. As ever, she continued to bend my ear with a series of difficulties and dilemmas, and while she might occasionally ask about things on my end, it was often only a minute or two later she would have a pressing need to get off the phone. I let the relationship drop somewhat. During this time both I and my boyfriend had scary health crises, my own mental health took a turn for the worse, and I continue to struggle to find help and resources for fairly crippling anxiety.  Over time it became clear to me that I was supposed to be the ""stable"" one and there simply wasn't a lot of room for me in our friendship. I also struggle to set appropriate boundaries and probably never did so with her, simply withdrawing and sharing less over time as I gradually returned fewer and fewer of her phone calls, knowing I would be in for another one-sided bitch session where, if I was lucky, she might acknowledge some of the things going on in my own life. Earlier this year I went to visit her for a few days on the west coast and was particularly struck by how far apart our lives seemed now: her already image-conscious tendencies becoming what felt to me full-blown narcissism, her ability to talk only about herself spun out of control by a recent ""eat-pray-love"" style sojourn abroad. I met some of her other local friends and they seemed interested only in getting drunk or high together, where I have been focused on getting sober in order to fully deal with my mental health. I decided quietly to let the friendship mellow further into acquaintanceship after I returned home.

Then the other shoe dropped. She had a bad health scare, followed by another, and then ultimately was diagnosed with cancer and had a hysterectomy. As she put it, she has ""been to hell and back"". I knew and still know I should be reaching out with love and support, but years of trying to shore up her fragile esteem and receiving only shallow companionship in return have totally depleted my resources. The girl who has cried to me over so many dogs was actually attacked by a wolf, and I just don't have anything left in me to care. Now she has left me a series of increasingly angry voicemails, the last of which sounded both irate and very final (I returned the message but haven't heard from her since). I'm not sure what to do except continue to berate myself for how lousily this whole situation turned out.

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR: I did my best to support a once-close friend of mine with BPD through a never-ending series of difficulties even when her only response to my own hardships was to get me high. Now I'm sober and trying to get my mental health in order, and she is battling cancer and extremely angry with me for being a shitty friend.

"How do I [F28] compromise on affection with my husband [M28] and avoid resentment that things don’t seem to change?


I’ll start by saying my husband and I have a great relationship. We’ve been together the better part of a decade and married for 5 years. He’s respectful and understanding, he cares so much about making me happy, and we communicate well. We’re honest when things bug us and try to immediately deal with any things that crop up as soon as we’re able to put words to what bothers us. 

I just have one big concern, and that’s the lack of follow through. When I tell him that I would really prefer more of something, he always feels so bad that I might not be getting what I need, vows to change, and actually makes slight improvements for a few days.....and then things go back to normal. Generally it’s the same topic every time: affection. If I ever bring up that things haven’t really changed in the past years that this has been coming up, he always seems so sad and disappointed because he thought things were better. He says it doesn’t come naturally and that change may be slow, but he’s 100% willing. 

Sometimes I worry that after all these years of asking, eventually I’m just going to have to do most of the compromising by myself on this issue. I knew who he was when we got married and I can live with that. But I don’t want to end up with any resentment, and I’m hoping for some new perspective on the issue. This is one area where it seems our inherent natures are at pretty different ends of the spectrum, and I know there’s a difference between compromise and becoming a different person just to make your partner happy. 

What do you guys think? Is there a way to get where I want to be? He feels like he’s been sincerely trying and that things slowly get better. I feel like things never change. Is it time for me to throw in the towel? Or, since he’s willing to do pretty much anything to make me happy, is there a way for us to meet in the middle with no hard feelings on either side?

**tl;dr** My husband wants to give me the affection I would prefer, and he thinks he’s slowly get better at it. I don’t feel the same, don’t know why things stay the same, and worry I’ll need to be the one to change."
"He hasn't contacted in a week, should I text?


tl;dr: dating a guy since June. He showed a lot of interest up until work got busy a month ago, hasn't texted in a week; should I text him ?



Hi everyone. So I (f/32) have been seeing this guy (m/28)since early June this year. We met online, and he had been pursuing me very persistently for months. It seemed he was doing everything to show me how much he liked me and wanted me. We texted every day, morning until bed time. We saw each other a few times a week, went on some really fun adventures. He would talk about the future etc and told me he was looking to settle down. He was really trying to impress me at first it felt like. I played hard to get because I had the interest of a couple other guys at the time, but eventually he wanted me to see him exclusively and I agreed.

I really thought things were going well, then what happened is he got very busy(about a month ago) with a deadline at work and his attitude started to change. Suddenly he wasn't as nice anymore when he was talking to me, and his responses became less frequent. He said he was tired and grumpy from work.I understood this and tried to give him space and time to be compassionate about his situation. 

Before anyone says ""he is lying about his deadline at work"", I just want to state that he is a construction worker and he is working on an arena which is two minutes from my house. I drive by it everyday and I know their deadline was like three months ago to get it done, so the work excuse seems to be legitimate but I don't think it's the only thing going on.

I feel like I did something wrong inadvertently and pushed him away. I was simply trying to be supportive of him, but he would get upset when I would say certain things like that I miss him. The communication we had during this time (over a month) was not excessive in my opinion at all, and also I hadn't seen him that entire month because he was constantly working (6 days a week)

So now it has been about a week since I heard from him, and at first I was thinking maybe it's his deadline at work, but it's a long weekend and I haven't heard anything from him. Not to mention it's Thanksgiving this weekend too...

I'm wondering if I should text him today, just say happy Thanksgiving and hope you're ok or should I just try to forget about him? I should add I have not attempted contact all week and was hoping he would contact me as I sent the last message (which just said good night) thanks guys"
"my boyfriend is mentally ill and i feel like i can’t help him at all.


repost from r/mentalhealth 

throwaway because my boyfriend knows about my actual reddit account.

my boyfriend and i (17F/M) have been dating for 9 months. we are in a long distance relationship but we plan to meet in december.

throughout the past month or so of our relationship, it’s been messy. we’ve had very high highs, or really low lows. it’s draining and i feel like we have been constantly arguing because of it. i struggle with mental problems myself, but after one of our arguments within the past week, my boyfriend came out to tell he thinks he has borderline personality disorder.

over the summer he told me he thinks he has depression. he said he doesn’t know what’s wrong with him but clearly something wrong with him. i’ve encouraged him to go and talk to a therapist multiple times, but he doesn’t know how he would ever tell his parents, which i completely understand because i also had a hard time bringing up the idea of therapy and medications and such to my parents. he also doesn’t like the idea of talking to someone that he doesn’t know. but, to be fair, he was never a person that liked to talk out their feelings. he would push them aside until the result of his problems blew up in his face, then he’d breakdown. he also tries to avoid me when he’s sad, because i try to talk with him about it and solve through his issues, but i end up getting sad too in the process, but that’s only because you never want to see the person you love in any sort of pain. at all. 

him telling me he thinks he has borderline personality disorder stuck with me. it’s a serious illness, and i have tried to get him to go to therapy, or try online therapy, anything. i am no doctor, i won’t self diagnose him, but i do think it’s a possibility that he might have it. it might make a lot of sense for some of the things he does. i really think he could have it, and i haven’t said anything to him about it since he told me. a day after he told me he said he was just “sad” and “doesn’t think he has it.” but, it’s really sticking with me. 

my boyfriend is impulsive. when we argue sometimes, he’ll say something so incredibly rude and usually it’s a direct attack to an issue i’ve discussed with him that had sparked a problem in our relationship, that we resolved, but when he brings it up like that, and is nasty about it... i don’t even know how to feel. he always ends up apologizing. he has also done other impulsive things.

i deal with being suicidal. i told him like recently i just had felt like killing myself and just ending it all. he fucking exploded on me when i said that. instead of comforting me, or anything, he went “do you care how i feel? i don’t think you do at all.” and a lot of other hurtful things, and i didnt get an ‘i love you’ until i told him to leave me alone and just not talk to me for a bit. i couldn’t understand. sometimes he’s just so absorbed into himself and acts as if no ones problems are as bad as his and he doesn’t care, and he’ll try to bring himself into the problems. i’ve seen him doing this with his friends who struggle with bad home lives / mental issues as well and he has nothing to say but like “oof.”
and for the first time i think it was done to me.

he tells me all the time of how he feels worthless, and how he’s not worthy of me, our relationship, life and that he’s a shitty boyfriend and he’ll never be able to make me happy. i am so far away from him, and i feel so helpless. i want to help him so so badly but the distance between us is straining me from being able to do so. i’ve thought about reaching out to SOMEONE that he knows in real life but he told me before that no one knows he wants to die besides me. it fucking breaks my heart. 

that’s another thing. he’s suicidal. about a month ago, he told me he wished i and his family didn’t care so if he died, he would have nothing to lose. he’s been struggling in school lately and i know it’s been hard on him, he doesn’t take easy classes. but lately i’ve been trying to address things in our relationship that have gone down lately. for example, the lack of effort &amp; attention from the relationship. he has told me before that he knows i’m always there and he knows that but he feels like he never is there. it’s long distance, and i know its harder but it wasn’t always like this. everytime i feel like i talk about it, i try to be as nice as possible. but it just turns into him letting out all of his insecurities, getting very very upset, crying, and telling me how he wishes he was dead and that he just wants to kill himself. if i pose the question of, “what about me?” he’ll say, “what about you?” and then he’ll go on to say that if he killed himself it would be a stress reliever for me. but then he’ll say something completely different like, “if i was going to kill myself i’d tell you” and “if it wasn’t for you, i wouldn’t be alive and that’s the reason i’m staying alive. i could never put you through that. it would change your life forever.”

whenever he talks about killing himself, or death, i get so scared and worried. i feel like i can never stop talking to him and i freak out and tell him not to do anything to himself or hurt himself. sometimes he’s really nice about it and other times he tells me to shut up and told me he’s promised me that he wouldn’t do such a thing.. then i just let him be. i’ve explained to him why i worry, and he still thinks i have no need to. like? it’s just instinct. i can’t not care about someone i love. i stick by his side through it all and i just want wants best for him, and i would do anything to take away or fix the pain he has.

i know i’m not supposed to be saving my boyfriend, but i do love him and i want the best for him. but i feel helpless and i don’t know what else more to do as a girlfriend. it is so fucking difficult. i am truly struggling.

tl;dr: ldr boyfriend is struggling with mental health issues and i am running out of things to do as a girlfriend and i am starting to feel helpless and like i can’t do anything for him. "
"I [22M] met a someone new but can’t tell if she [20F] is into me or not?


Backstory:

My mate basically introduced us to eachother over tinder (wierd one I know), but we started talking and hit it off pretty much straight away. We get along well with eachother, and after a few days talking we went out on our first date.

Now me not being a fan of dinner dates etc straight away we went dog walking and it went really well as it was relaxed and it didnt feel like an interrogation like it does over dinner. Anyway, we got along well, spoke all the time had a good laugh and there were no awkward silences or moments. We hugged and kissed at the end of the date and that was that.

After the date was done, she actually texted me soon after saying she had a good time. I replied saying I also had a good time and suggested we should do it again, we have texted pretty much everyday since we started talking however she works two jobs and has a good social life so when she’s at work or busy etc I give her space by saying have a good shift etc, and leave it until she replies which she often does. I have noticed in the last week or so.

We went out again on date 2 on Friday, we played Mini Golf and Bowling and it was great again. We had a good laugh as she beat me at golf and I beat her at bowling, we were talking about her friends etc alot, and it went well even though we were both fairly shattered after long weeks we still had a nice time. Again at the end we kissed and hugged etc and she texted me first again soon after the date.

Her texting seems to have dropped abit but she works nearly everyday maybe has 1 day a week off, but that doesnt really concern me. 


TL;DR: Met this girl and cant tell if shes interested in me or not, get mixed signals from texting to in person.

"Do I [F/48] give up on a rare relationship if he [M/48] is too vague?


I have a very unique relationship that is hard to define (therapist agrees). I welcome perspectives on  on and what the right actions should be. I can elaborate as needed.

These are the things I am deeply satisfied by in the relationship I have had with him (over the past year and a half):

1. Kind, constant, and honest communication (we text/call every day and see each other 1-2 times a week)
2. The willingness to work through difficulties and disagreements/forgiveness
3. A sense of humor, fun, and a bit of distraction from everyday life
4. Sharing life lessons and personal goals/dreams with each other/learning from each other
5. Emotional support, validation, and compliments
6. Mutual desire, intimacy, and monogamous sex
7. Compassion and acceptance of each other
8. Ability to admit mistakes and to talk about them

From my perspective, the component that would make this kind of intimacy a “commitment” is planning for the future together, something we’ve never done and doesn’t seem to be needed. We're both single parents just trying to take care of our respective children. But looking at this list, I believe what we have is far more intimate than most friends with benefits ever experience. In his eyes, we are friends with benefits. In my eyes, we have a relationship. I believe he feels more but would prefer to keep his feelings shut off owing to some devastating heartbreaks of the past.

He says one thing in words and another thing in actions, such as:

\-He reveals more to me than anyone else in his life.

\-He has introduced me to (and included me with) his closest circle of friends and his children

\-He is affectionate outside the bedroom - kisses, holds hand, touches

\-He will stop others to hear what I have to say

\-He wants to see me / talk to me consistently

Recently we decided to stop sleeping together because I felt that if he was not in love with me in return, I was selling myself short. I grew possessive of him over time and it caused a strain on our relationship. I tried to cut him out of my life, however, whenever I have tried to pull away from him, we both get very depressed.

I am not interested in seeking out a relationship with anyone else at this point. My feelings for him are very deep. His feelings for me are strong but he consistently caveats his ""I love you"" with ""as a friend."" What I am struggling with most is my desire for him - it is stronger than any desire I have ever experienced. Being around each other (in person) is hard for both of us. Our thoughts and conversations can easily wander to our mutual longing. He has never experienced the kind of intense desire and sex that he does with me. I believe that it is only a matter of time before we fall into each other again.

I have two choices from what I see - to (a) simply give in to our mutual longing and let nature run its course or (b) stop being around him physically and simply keep our connection and communication remote. I don't know that we'll ever be on the same level with our feelings but I also know that what we share is very rare.

Thoughts?

"I [22M] was completely terrible at sex and it makes me feel inadequate, and then I get told that recently all the feelings for me have been suddenly lost


So me \[22m\] and my girlfriend (20f) are both the type of people to wait for a relationship to have PIV sex for each of our first times. We'd been dating a few months and became official a couple of weeks ago.

Problem 1:

So we had full PIV sex for the first time today and I did terribly. So bad in fact that she asked if we were just sexually incompatible or something...

Mainly I couldn't get the angle right from basically any position.  Sometimes I got something good going for a few strokes in missionary but that was it. Could never seem to get my hips lined up correctly. Dick was always going in at the wrong angle and I couldn't keep the same angle straight for more than a couple of strokes. I seem alright at the multitasking with other stuff like kissing neck, playing with nipples, moving hands up and down body, etc etc ... but I. CAN'T. SEEM. TO. GET. MY. DICK. TO. GO. IN. A. VAGINA. AT. THE. CORRECT. ANGLE. LET. ALONE. SUSTAIN. IT. FOR. MULTIPLE. STROKES.

However when she was on top she seemed like she had everything figured out.

I'm extremely self critical ... it's a gift when it comes to perfecting something but when I suck at something and can't even get the basics right it really hits me hard and digs into me.

I just swear I never hear anyone have this problem, it's always ""I couldn't find the hole"" or ""she vomited on my dick while deepthroating me"" or some other dumb stuff. And then watching amateur porn and they clearly have every angle figured out perfectly and I just don't understand....

Problem 2:

And then I get told that she'd suddenly lost all her feelings for me a couple of days ago and didn't know if it was just her period fucking with her hormones and emotions of if it was going to be permanent. She seems to be so up and down with her feelings for me and it confuses me so much. One week it's ""I want you as my boyfriend"" and the next it's ""lets just be friends I don't feel that spark between us"" and it seemingly keeps repeating, seems extremely not-deliberate on her part but it's thrown my heart around a lot in the past and it seems like it's happening again.

Is this a common thing that people experience or have been on the other end of? Is it just a girl thing? As a guy I feel like I like someone or I don't and it really doesn't change at all..... can't life be simple please?!

"I [26F] was ghosted by friend [27F] of 5 years because she said we didn't mesh well but she's now getting close with my other friends.


Hello everyone!

This is my first post on Reddit and I am very eager/nervous to see any advice for what I am about to type.

My friend was a bridesmaids for me and everything was going well. After the wedding, maybe 3 months after to be precise, I haven't heard from her so I've been texting her to do dinner or just grab a quick drink but she always busy with something. Naturally, I thought it was weird. (I am going to refer her as Jane now because it's going to get a little wordy). What caught my attention was that another close friend of mine (who was also my bridesmaid) told me that ""Jane"" has been trying to plan a trip with my other friends she's met through me. Bear in mind, that she has only met my other friends twice. I was so confused as to why I wasn't invited so I asked her why and Jane said she no longer wanted to be friends with me because I don't mesh well with her. It was hard to digest that but eventually I came to peace with it. 

What hurts me so much right now is that Jane is getting so close with my other friends. I know she doesn't give a single thought about me for a second but here I am constantly thinking what went wrong and how do I be cool about Jane forming a friendship with my friends? Is it selfish of me to think that she shouldn't be friends with my friends? I don't reach out to her group of friends out of respect, even though I have met Jane's friends on numerous occasions. I don't know how to stop brooding over this. It has been more than 2 months! I understand that I have no ownership of my friends and that they can do whatever they want! It just hurts....

Thank you for reading. It helped a lot just typing that out.

"What the hell? He gets mad at me for breaking up with him then he begs me to talk to him then ignores me when I agree to talk to him?


He is a 29/m and I’m a 30/f. I feel bad. But he seems so distant and weird and didn’t appreciate me coming straight to his place after I got home from a long vacay. One where he didn’t seem too interested in my sexy texts and one where he did t seem too interested in my day and would ignore me for hours. I feel bad. It also I was really hurt when he would have weird comments about sexy pics I sent him. Or when he didn’t seem too interested about my day. 

I especially felt bad when I went to his place ASAP after I came back. We did it and he kind of rolled over and went to sleep. He mentioned offhand the present I got him before he went to work. 

He has just seemed weird and distant and his texts never seemed to ask questions or offer any more answers. He didn’t seem stoked to see me really and I initiated the phone calls we had when I was away. He was super upset when I told him that I wasn’t feeling this. But he like didn’t seem to want to talk. Just wanted to sleep. Didn’t seem interested in my vacay and texts and now I feel terrible. 

I always do this when I stand up for myself and what I think I end up feeling terrible. Any advice y’all? 

**TLDR: told my boyfriend my feelings and now I feel terrible, messages below**

This was his response- see comments below

And later I said this

He was kinda shitty and said that I didn’t respond to him immediately after I messaged him that and said “talk about being distant” because I told him he seemed distant. But I had already told him my patient at work was dying and had to be transferred so I couldn’t talk then because it happens in like two seconds. 

*Now he begged to talk to me in person about this issue. I apologized for the way I brought it up and say it sounds good to meeting up and he has totally ignored my text as usual*

Example of him ignoring anything I said: https://imgur.com/a/6EggmDs"
"Me [20M] and my girlfriend [20F] long term relationship and I'm feeling a bit lost


I've been in a relationship for a couple years now and we've had a few rocky moments but also a few amazing experiences together. We have a lot in common but recently I've felt a little bit unsatisfied. 

It's partly due to my hectic timetable, I never have much free time and neither does she. I also moved out recently so I live a bit of a distance away and the cost of the new place means I'm normally broke. However we do argue about petty things, often revolving around her opinions or statements regarding people and their situations. She once shouted in an arguement that her degree was the only real degree, or that people who didn't get into university are scum. Despite these things she's wonderful to me, it makes me feel guilty because of the effort and passion she has for the relationship, she also cares a lot about human rights and equality.  

I have issues with mood swings and my personality so often i get myself worked about trivial things however but I do know I felt this for a while. I just want to be alone, be a bit selfish. I've discussed this with her once before a long time back but she blamed it on me having commitment issues, where as this is her first proper relationship and I often think she has a more than idealistic interpretation of relationships. Which she often does things to reinforce this symbollically with photos, and how she describes our relationship to her friends and on Instagram. 

**TL;DR long term relationship, I'm unsatisfied and unsure what to do.**"

"How do I [27/f] transition moving out of my boyfriend's [28/m] place? I want to break up, move, and be alone.


I've been in a relationship with my boyfriend for 3.5 years, and he was actually the first person who I saw a future with (marriage, kids). I feel like our relationship isn't working out anymore and I don't care to salvage it; I think it's best that we break up. He's a great guy, not abusive, and understanding... I'm just unhappy and want to feel happy, alone, and take care of things I want to focus on with no distractions. I hate the state (MO) that I live in, and moved here 2 years ago from CO because rent was expensive and my bf wanted to finish school/wanted to be near family. My family is in Cali.

&amp;#x200B;

We've spoken about it, but out of fear and uncertainty of my future, I've bugged out on breaking up/moving. I just don't know what to do.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm unsure of how to transition out since I live with him. All of my belongings are here, and I have about 6k saved up. I don't really like California and don't want to live with my parents. I regret moving out of Colorado, because now I don't know how I'll find a place to live there again, and it's very crowded now since a lot of people have been moving there.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm thinking about moving to MN but have not checked it out yet. 

&amp;#x200B;

Anyone have any ideas on how I can transition out? I'm afraid because it's going to be another big step/transition in life.

&amp;#x200B;

**TLDR**; I want to break up with my boyfriend and move to a different state, but now sure how to go about with it."
