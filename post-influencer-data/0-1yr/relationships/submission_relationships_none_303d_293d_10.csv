"[UPDATE] How can I [19f] talk to him [20m] about our sex life?


 

Although my [original post](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/6ddj8r/how_can_i_19f_talk_to_him_20f_about_our_sex_life/) didn't get much attention, it's been about a year and a half and I thought I'd give an update. 

We broke up. In my original, I stated that our relationship was otherwise 'fine', but I see now that I had been deluding myself. My boyfriend never treated me right, and used me more like a mother (did all cleaning, cooking and organising... yes, I made his doctor's appointments). One of the few times he could bring himself to have sex with me, my period started unexpectedly (*really* unexpectedly, as my implant meant I hadn't bled in two years!!) and he continued to bring up how 'disgusted' by me he was for months afterwards and used it as a reason that he couldn't have sex with me.

So what was the real reason for the abstinence? He was cheating, of course! Found that out after he got stupid drunk at my mother's house, puked everywhere (I cleaned it up) and I tucked him in bed and put his phone on charge... which made the screen light up, and there was a text from her. I got the hell out of dodge and moved in with one of my best friends and his girlfriend.

Now, I'm happy to report that after some dark months of dealing with my first real, painful break-up, my life has been moving in an upward trajectory! I found a much better job, my social life isn't confined to the friends of my partner who hate me, and I have a boyfriend of 9 months who never lets me doubt that he loves me. Guys, he can cook and clean and I don't have to call his doctor or mobile provider. I am so happy. Please, if you feel like you aren't being loved and respected in your relationship, GET OUT OF THERE!! I guarantee someone out there will treat you like a human being!! Thank you to the few who commented, it made me feel better about a shitty situation at the time.

Oh, and my current squeeze never lets me go more than a few days without some lovin', so that got better too ;)

**TL;DR** he cheated and it sucked, but not really because he was an awful partner in hindsight. new man much better and my life is more fulfilled :)"

"Me [30f] with my partner [33m] 4 years, he no longer wants to contribute to charitable causes, and wants me to follow suit.


Charitable giving has always been a major factor in my life. I was raised Catholic, and was put through a Catholic school, the caveat being that it was always 100% on scholarship. My family was always on the scary side of broke until mid high school, when some crazy things happened and suddenly both of my parents had really awesome, well-paying jobs (that they are still in to this day). 

School really pushed us to be active in our community when it came to giving. Whether it was volunteering with seniors, or animals, or at food pantries (none of which ever had to be specifically Catholic in nature), or collecting food donations or shoes or coats at church, or school supply drives, there was always something going on.

I'm not a deeply religious person anymore and I can't say I ever was. There are parts about Catholicism that I still connect with, and charitable giving is the major one. I believe in being kind to others. 

Since I was a kid, I've given a portion of whatever money I have to different causes. I have always taken them seriously and have researched them and learned about all different kinds of places. Once I got through college and started in on my own career, I was able to make a nice donation yearly, or set up recurring donations with my paycheck. I'm still involved with my parish, and whenever there's a school supply drive or coat drive, I will do what I can to help. 

In my eyes, I was sometimes on the receiving end of those things growing up. It's my duty to turn around and do the same. 

In terms of how much, let's say I make $75k/year. Where i live, that's enough for me to live comfortably on my own and still put money away in savings. Last year, I donated $5,000 ($1,000 in the school supply drive, and then various amounts to different causes, and $500 to a GoFundMe for a local family who lost their home). In terms of giving money to my church, instead of giving monthly or weekly, I tend to give to larger projects and volunteer my time for things instead. For example, once a month they have donuts and coffee after mass. I will volunteer to help make the coffee. It's a small act, but it helps the woefully underpaid church workers. 

My boyfriend has always thought this part of me was good, but I guess he changed his mind. Last week, someone at the church asked me if I would be able to help set up the Jesse tree, which is a tree where people pick off ornaments that have the wishes of a local person through a charity, like hiking boots or an action figure or something like that, and we all bring them and people distribute them. In setting up the tree, I would just come in one day and... set up a fake tree, decorate it all nicely, and that's it. 

Henry, my boyfriend, asked me if I could maybe ""tone down"" the ""causes"" this year. He explained that he feels like he is missing out on presents or things like that, or experiences, because I pool my money into charity causes and things like that. I was very taken aback.

Henry was also raised Catholic and while he sometimes comes with me to Mass (I have never, and will never badger him to come or anything like that. He comes if he wants to. And I go maybe once a month.). He didn't have the same upbringing that I do, and instead has had a solid upper middle class upbringing. 

I asked if he was bothered because of the ties to the church (he has been going less and less over time, which I want to reiterate is absolutely fine with me), but he said he didn't care about that, just the fact that I give away a lot of money and he thinks we should keep more of it. Henry makes roughly the same amount that I do, and so between the two of us, we make quite a nice amount. We share major things like rent, car insurance, groceries, etc. 

Henry said that he thinks I'm throwing my money away and that we could be $5,000 richer this year if I hadn't thrown it at my latest cause. I told him how important it is to me to be able to pay back the kindnesses people afforded me over the year, and he said -- which is the big issue here, ""Just because your family was poor and took every handout you could doesn't mean we should encourage other people to do it. It's not our problem if some kid doesn't have a pair of winter boots. Maybe their parents should have pulled out.""

This left me really shocked and hurt. He's never spoken to me like that. He's never sounded so callous about the poor. I could understand if we were living in a crumbling studio apartment eating rice and beans every day and I kept throwing money at people. But we live in a beautiful apartment, we both have newer, nice cars, and while I shop for my clothes at Goodwill &amp; budget and meal plan, I do those things because my parents instilled a sense of frugality in me. 

I don't know where this leaves us. To be frank, if that is truly the way he sees the world, and the way he sees my family especially, I don't know that we are compatible people. I hope to have at least one child, and he was on the same page. But I don't know now.

Could there be more going on that I'm not seeing? Is it really so bad that I donate what I do?

**tl;dr** My boyfriend wants me to stop giving money to charity as often, and made a crass comment about how my family accepted any handout we were taken and that we shouldn't encourage that in others. Unsure if we are actually compatible now. "
"Me [28M] and coworker [27F] use to talk a lot, and then sudden stop to conversation - what could cause?


Hi,

I posted this with ""non-romantic"" flair beccause I think it is, but maybe it isn't the proper flair because I suspect the issues outlined below is to do with my misunderstanding of dating.

Around May this year, I met a coworker who works out of an office in a different city about 4 hours from where I live. We met at a training event that brought together stafff from a variety of offices across the state.

We got along well, exchanged phone numbers, and planned to meet in my hometown a month later since she would be visiting for non-work reasons. We met, and it was nice to spend sometime together out of work. We stayed in touch pretty regularly, and I even saw her one more time in person as she was visiting my town again. In August, we stopped talking completely. She said she was going to visit family, and I responded with a text or two. I never heard anything, then a week or so later I asked how her trip was to visit family, and never heard back. We went from texting 4-5 times a week to 0 overnight.

Now, I realize that she might have ""liked"" me when we first started talking... but we also spent a lot of time talking about work. I thought we just had a good relationship and it was fun to stay in touch with someone from another office. I never really considered the possibility of sleeping with her or dating her, considering she lived 4 hours a way from where I live.

I'm wondering if my lack of communication about intentions might have been a cause for us no longer talking? Perhaps she had a different intention? Any thoughts or similar stories? Is it always best to make intentions clear in male-female relationships?

In a more general sense, is it even possible for men and women to be friends without sleeping with eachother? (I was opperating under the ""yes"" category during this relationship).

I'm hoping to understand how to handle this type of situation in the future! Thanks.

tl;dr: I was talking a lot with a female co-worker and then all of a sudden we stopped talking. I suspect it's because she was interested in me and I didn't make my intentions clear. Is this likely? In a more general sense, can men and women be friends?"
"Fiancé M[31] told me F[29] that I'm the reason why he wants to die


So this happened yesterday. We have been together for 12 years now and we have a 5 year old. I don't know how to react to this, he says that I put a lot of pressure on him. The bottom line for him was that I told him that he shouldn't make promises to our daughter and then don't keep them. He promised yesterday that we were going to be out all day buying the Christmas tree. He was buying stuff for his vacation to Europe and when the time came to purchase the tree, he was too tired. I obviously told him that he was careless for making a promise like that. 
He was very angry because he says a put a lot of pressure on him and told me that I was the reason why he wants to kill himself. That hurt me deeply... So today we were heading to the movies to see fantastic beasts and he told me we always do what I want for his birthday (he came up with the movie idea).

Just to give you a little background, we have been under a lot of pressure lately, this year has sucked. He had a spinal surgery, I was fired two times, I was diagnosed a tumor (benign) and the bills have taken a toll on us. However I don't think he should say that to me, honestly, I feel that I don't want to say anything because I don't want to put more pressure on him. Sometimes I critize a lot and I want to get better, I just don't know how.

Any advice?

TL;DR: fiancé told me I am the reason why he wants to kill himself because I put a lot of pressure on him "
"I [16M] broke up with my GF [17F] of 2 years because she tried to shoplift and she's threatening and doing self harm.


My family and finally moved into our new house. My parents had this home built from the ground up and it's really nice. We all have our own bathrooms. I said to my little sister that I'd pick her up in the afternoon, and we can go to BB&amp;B or Target and buy some stuff for our rooms. I said I would treat her because she's turning 14 next week. My girlfriend wanted to tag along with us. 

As we were finishing up, I looked down and I noticed a makeup suitcase. I turned to my sister and asked if she put this in here. She said she didn't and didn't know where it came from. It was $250 and I would not have gotten it regardless. Our shopping came to $300 as it was. My girlfriend stormed off without saying a word. Later on, she shoves me and calls me a fucking idiot. She said that no one would noticed if I just kept my mouth shut. I was confused to what she was talking about at first. She said that I almost got her caught by giving it back to an employee and explaining I didn't know where it came from. 

I realized that she was talking about the make up thing. I got angry because she could have gotten us all arrested. What if the alarm had gone off? We got into this big argument. The thing that really pisses me off is that I asked if she wanted something for under $100. She said no. So she goes and tries to steal and $250 item. I ended up breaking up with her. She got on her knees and was hugging my leg.

She's telling everyone that if she kills herself it's my fault. Every cut she does it because of me. I don't know if I should just take her back, because if she ends up killing herself I don't know what I'd do. 

TL;DR: Girlfriend could have gotten my sister and I in trouble for shop lifting, and now when I break up with her she'd threatening to kill herself. She sent me a picture on snap chat with cuts on her arm. "
"How do i(15M) get my older sisters (22F/25F/27F) to even talk to me or not blow me off.


 When i was really young like 1-9 years old my sisters and i were close but as time faded and my 2 oldest sisters moved out to have their own apartment and when my youngest older sister moved out at 21 last year it was kinda the final straw. I haven't talked to them when i make the effort to make plans they all say there busy its just the 4 of us and i feel really left out as I see on their snaps that they see each other a lot cause they live in the same apartment building we live in Buffalo New York so its a bigger town and everything. The finale straw that i actually cried about was at the beginning of fall i got sick and went into the hospital and not once did they come to see me just over the 10 days i was in there my oldest sister called me once but that was it. I want to be close to them and I love sooo much but i think they don't love me back.   


td;lr older sister blow me off constantly how do i have a relationship with them?"
Nice n toasty now
"Worried about my [24M] girlfriend's [24F] behavior, is it appropriate for me to contact her therapist?


My girlfriend and I have been dating for about 2 years and living together for 1 year. She has struggled with mental health problems (anxiety, depression, suicidal thoughts, and borderline personality disorder (BPD) stemming from childhood trauma) since I've known her. To make a very long story short, our relationship has had some serious problems lately and I've realized that I don't see a future with this woman anymore. I made the decision to break things off and broke the news to her yesterday. 


She did not take it well and on top of cycling between complete devastation and pure anger/hatred every 5 minutes, she has been insisting that she will commit suicide. She even made an ""attempt"" but based on the manner she was ""attempting"" it was obvious she was just being dramatic. Before people get angry at me not treating a suicide attempt seriously, when I say ""attempt"", picture something like trying to hang yourself with a shoe string from a fixture that is less than 4 feet off the ground. Or throwing an unplugged appliance into the bath tub. Or attempting an ""overdose"" on vitamin C. Nevertheless I am concerned about her behavior because she is clearly unstable and unpredictable. Even though her ""attempt"" was somewhat of a ruse I am worried that things might get more serious if I don't give in to her begging for me to give the relationship another chance. Today she continues to talk about suicide and how ""it's all over"", ""please remember me"", etc. 

What am I supposed to do in this situation? Since she is not literally holding a knife to her throat or hurting herself I don't think if I called a police or ambulance they would really want to do anything about it. I'm not really qualified to determine whether or not she really intends to go through with it. She has a therapist that she hasn't seen in about a month. Is it appropriate for me to call the therapist and ask for her advice on how to handle this? I have never been to a therapist so I'm not sure if this is some kind of breach of trust or if it violates any types of rules. I'm not trying to unload the responsibility for the breakup on another person, I just want my (ex) girlfriend to be OK and I need someone to tell me how to perform this break up in a way that will be least damaging to her mental health.

tl;dr girlfriend talking/attempting suicide after break up, thinking about contacting therapist.

"I've (34m) learned a lot these past two years


 

Around 2 years ago my (32F) wife left me to be with her boss. I was devastated. I wanted to keep our family together and actually try to work things out. Later on I found out how much she hated me, how much she hated my family and was overall saying terrible things about me throughout our marriage.

That wasn't the worst part. I was suffering from PTSD and depression because of the military and some other experiences. I later found out who my real family and friends were and what the word love actually means.

I struggled so much these past two years and I finally got my life back on track. I look at my ex now she had another affair with a married man and got pregnant. And I've seen what that's done to my kids.

I learn not to take things for granted, I've learned that trust is something that's earned and not very easily. I've also learned not to hate. While I don't respect my ex and her boyfriend I don't hate them and  I just wish they were better examples for the kids. They like to brag about taking them to places and doing things with them but overall I can see they're not great people.

tl:dr The lesson I've learned overall is that being a good person is not easy but it's worth it."
"I (23f) saw a man (27m) on bumble. Recognized him as an acquaintance’s bf/ baby daddy. Do I tell her?


So I (23f) recently moved back to my hometown. I was going through bumble and see this man (27m) who I know (from Instagram)  is dating and has a child with a girl (23f) I went to high school with. Me and her probably have spoken like once when she tried to bring me into her pyramid scheme and at best she’s someone I follow on Instagram. I know that they’re still together cause I saw his profile for the first time a few weeks ago. And she has continued to post pictures of him and her 2 children (one from a previous relationship) calling him hubby and such. They’re not engaged or anything but it seems like that’s where they’re headed. As someone who’s been cheated on a lot, I want to tell her but I’ve asked my coworkers for advice (they don’t know her) and all but one said I’d be ruining her life and I shouldn’t. I know that that’s what I would want in her situation but that doesn’t mean she would want it.

I don’t know enough about her to know where she lives so I can’t send her an anonymous letter or I don’t know any of her friends (she was bullied a lot in hs). He’s also objectively not attractive so I don’t think it’s a catfish account. And we live in a pretty conservative area where open relationships aren’t likely but I guess I never knows 

Should I tell her? If so, what’s the best approach? 

Tl;dr: recognized a man on bumble as someone bf. Should I tell her? "
"My [35M] only friend [29M] just moved out of the state and now my only friend is my wife [32F]. She’s awesome as hell but I get incredibly lonely when she works nights or goes out. I used to just go hang out with him but now I have no clue what to do.


I  have a bit of social anxiety so making new friends is very difficult  and uncomfortable for me.  I have another “friend” in town who was a  former coworker but it feels very forced and neither of us puts much  energy into it.

Getting older is hard  because my wife and I are child-free and most likely continuing down  that path.  More and more of her friends are having kids and most (I  guess now all) of my friends are from my time in the military and have  gotten stationed elsewhere in addition to having kids.

I  used to play World of Warcraft and had a guild on discord that was a  lot of fun, that fell apart and now I don’t play that anymore.  I’ve  been thinking about doing that again just for the social contact.  I  also enjoy PlayStation and Switch games, but have no friends on either  system besides my buddy who no longer lives here on Switch.

Most  of my coworkers are older than me and the few that are around my age  have kids and also don’t have much in common with me.  I also don’t like  them all that much :/.

My wife is  awesome, she is honestly an incredible friend and partner and soon her  schedule is shifting and we should get a bit more time together, but I  also think it’s important to get some social interaction outside of  one’s romantic relationship.

I know I  should probably focus on my hobbies that get me out of the house but  fuck this week sucks and I can’t really picture doing anything.  I used  to mountain bike a lot but that friend was from another country and  moved back home.  I used to hang out with a big group of friends but we  all fell apart.

This is natural and I’ve  been dealing with the panicked feeling of dwindling relationship  strength since high school, but I’ve dwindled to nothing.  And now my  panic is different:  What if I’m just out of friends?

All  those times I didn’t call to hang out or flaked on plans make me feel  really stupid right now.  I don’t want to meet new people, or if I do I  don’t want the awkwardness of it, I just want things to have stayed the  same.  I’m not really sure what to do.

TL;DR:  My only friend moved away, now I don't have any friends nearby and I really don't know how to go about making new friends at 35, and I'm not even sure I want to."
"Is it wrong for me [38 M] to want to leave a perfectly good relationship with my girlfriend [36 F]?


I spent my 20s being irresponsible, pursuing music, partying, etc. Now, in my late 30s, I finally have a career path. Girlfriend wants to get married and have kids like, yesterday, and she’s been putting up with my indecision on this subject for a long time.

I stay because the mechanics of the relationship are good, we work things out logically when they need to be worked out, we support each other a great deal through thick and thin etc. But I don’t see marriage and kids in my future. I’m not ready to take that on. I want to focus more time and energy on my IT career, especially since I don’t have a college degree or any formal training. The curve is pretty big for me, plus I need time to work on stuff that I enjoy outside of that, and the obligations of the relationship make it so that I never get enough development time to REALLY get good at any one thing, so my progress is slow. 

Maybe it’s because I’m an only child, but I find the concept of sharing my life with another person just really weird. I’ve been in a few long term relationships throughout my 20s and thirties (this one going on 7 years now), and I never really view any of them as permanent. I don’t stray and I don’t cheat (never have), but I don’t see things as set in stone. I also tend to be emotionally distant and this relationship is no exception. I’m extremely afraid of commitment and to be honest, I don’t really know if I ever want kids. Like, I like the idea of it, but the reality seems extremely draining when I can barely handle my own life. The clock is starting to run out on fertility though, so she wants babies ASAP. 

I feel like I should end things for her sake, and maybe she can find someone who is good for her and has his shit together already and I can devote more time to making bigger strides in my career and self development, which are most definitely more important to me right now. I don’t know. 

TL;DR - Our relationship is great for a lot of reasons but I want to leave because I don’t see the same future she does."
"My (20m) girlfriend (20f) is being harrassed at work


My girlfriend (20) is working at a grocery store as we both save up money so she can move out to me and continue going to school. For a little context I currently live about 6 hours away by car and come and see her whenever I can, I cant move back as I am currently serving in the military. They guys in question do know I exist although I've never seen them.

Anyway my GF is constantly being harrassed by multiple male coworkers, asking her on dates and flirting with her. Today one of her coworkers slipped his number inside of her purse, I asked if I could have the number so I could talk to him and get them all to back off but she insists she can take care of herself. We have talked about reporting them but 2 of these men are the ones directly above her in the chain, the only other person above them is the owner who is never there.

Is there anything I can do here? I feel so helpless and it makes me extremely uncomfortable everytime she goes into work.

tl;dr girlfriend is being flirted with by 4+ guys at work and one went into her purse to put his number in there. I am too far away to do anything and wondering what we can do"
"I get really angry and anxious when my husband doesn't come home at night.


I'm 26, F and my husband is 28. We both work full time, he works over full time hours driving for Lyft. We recently moved in with roommates and he's having a tough time adjusting to our new town and living situation.

I can't sleep when my husband isn't home. I feel super anxious and angry, then can't sleep all night long, and if I do sleep it's just an hour or two at a time. Last weekend I completely lost it because he was out drinking all night with his friends both Friday and Saturday night (Friday he didn't come home at all, stayed at a friends house because he got so drunk, Saturday he came home at 4am, technically Sunday, absolutely wreaking of booze). I completely erupted and told him how done I was with him not coming home or telling me he'd be home late. He felt horrible and apologized to me, and I thought he understood how much it effects me. 

Fast forward to last night. Its 12:30am and he's still not home. I text him asking when he'll be home. He tells me he's staying at his friend's apartment again so he can actually sleep because he can't get a good night's sleep at our new place. I completely freak out. I tell him to come home because I can't sleep, that we just talked about this etc. He just tells me he needs to sleep and that he's staying there, and ignores all my calls and messages. Of course I can't sleep all night because of how pissed I am, it felt like my blood was boiling under my skin. 

Am I being totally ridiculous or am I in the right for feeling this way? I tried calling him this morning and he didn't answer or respond to me. Its 11am. I know he knows I'm pissed. 

TL;DR: I get irrationally angry and anxious when my husband doesn't come home at night and I can't sleep. He spent the night at a friend's last night, because he has a hard time sleeping in our new place shared with roommates, and I'm extremely angry. "

"MY dad doesn't like my GF because she's not rich


Just to provide some context, my dad has known this girl for years for we have been friends sinxe young. started dating recently and when he found out he was NOT happy at all.

This girl, same age as me, has been with me as a friend for almost 12 years and we started dating. When i told my parents, my mother was happy because she always liked her, she has great personality and my mom is always happy to have her around and would also jokingly call my gf her future daughter in law back in the past.

However, when my dad found out, he was unhappy as he felt she was 'not good enough for me'. I'm really mad at him for it because he didn't grow up wealthy either and is now telling me to leave my SO because she isn't doing financially as well as me. We grew up from completely different backgrounds, i lived a good and comfortable life with two loving parents in a condo while she was raised by a single mom with 2 siblings in a cramped studio apartment. Of course, things have changed now and now she works as a nurse while i a banker. 

I've tried convincing my dad to let me date her, but he is stubborn af and will NOT listen to me. Does anyone have any advice on how i should convince my dad to let me date this girl? i rlly like her and it'd be a shame to lose her so quick.

"I (F19) am confused by this guy's (M19?) actions.


I am a 19 year old woman, and I am currently attending a college English class. In that class, there is a guy that's intriguing to me. And I admit, I'm smitten for him. However, I'm not sure if he feels the same way. From my interpretation, his actions and general demeanor indicates that he's a stoic or just someone that hides his true emotions. Maybe shyness or something like that.

  Anyway, he is generally reserved, and always serious ALL THE TIME. I do not believe I've seen him smile in all the time I have known him; yet he's extremely pleasant, and a genuine nice guy who is always ready to help anyone. It is this that attracted me to him in the first place. However, I'd call this a catch twenty-two or something like that. This is the part I hate. Not his generosity, just that it's harder to tell if he likes me because of his altruistic traits. I'll explain: Usually, I can tell when a guy likes me by how he treats me compared to other people, namely women. At first, I thought, this'll be easy, he barely shows emotion. It did not play out that way, though because he's like this with everyone. However, and I can't think of a way to say this without sounding like a cocky person, so I'll just go out and put it bluntly: I consider myself to be the prettiest girl in the class. Like, it is not even close. So, maybe he saw me dropping my bag as the perfect opportunity to talk to me. When I think about it, he did rush over to help me when I dropped my bag.

 Anyway, my question is this: How can I tell if he's genuinely interested in me? Or is he just a nice person with no romantic intentions?

 Tl;DR: I can't tell if the guy I'm interested in likes me back because he's such a nice person to everyone."
"How do you and your spouse handle expenses when one earns significantly more than the other?


My bf and I of 1.5 years are talking about possibly getting married, and I know a more serious talk about money will inevitably come up soon. We already know we will not be having a joint account, mainly because we are not comfortable with the idea that we would use the money from that account to buy things that the other might not want or need. We have no problem with managing our own money separately.

A little financial background - he has a stable job that pays well, I on the other hand am a freelancer, sometimes earning a decent amount, but most times don’t earn enough to have a significant amount of savings. If I averaged out my annual earnings, I’d still be earning a lot less than my bf. And because I don’t earn a lot, I am very careful with my money, as I rarely use credit cards or make impulse buys, and try to save as much money as I can.

Sometimes he would offer to pay for most of our dinners or date activities, but I never straight up asked him to pay or buy me things or took any of it for granted. I would always offer to split the tab, but I would let him pay if he insisted. Other times I will try to find opportunities to treat him back. I know I don’t spend as much on him as much as he does on me, but not because I don’t want to. I absolutely love making nice gestures for my bf, but it shouldn’t have to burden me financially.

Earlier we were arguing about future rent (we haven’t moved in together yet), my bf believed that rent should be split 50-50, but I had a different opinion. I told him it wouldn’t be fair for me to take out half of my monthly earnings to pay 50% of the rent while the same amount of money might only take up 10% of his income. He thought about it and said that made sense but shortly later said I shouldn’t worry too much, as he assumed that I would just make him pay for everything else when we are married, like groceries, meals out, household appliances or baby stuff when we start having kids. I was a bit upset that he assumed that.

This is why I want to know how you married couples out there handle your finances. Personal expenses aside, how did you and your spouse decide on how to split the expenses like bills, rent, groceries, meals, dates or kid expenses? Was everything clearly calculated? Did you have a separate or joint account? Do you think it is unfair for the spouse who makes more money to also contribute more financially?

I want to make sure my bf and I are clear on these things before we actually move forward in our relationship to being married, so I would love to hear what made it work for you guys!

TL,DR
Bf makes a lot more money than I do, but hopes I can contribute 50% of future family expenses like bills and rent, while I think this would burden me more than him financially. How would you manage your finances in a relationship, especially within a marriage?"
"My [M26] girlfriend’s best friend [F27] got naked in front of me last night.


To preface this, I am from the UK, and I’m currently living abroad in another European country. I know that they have quite a liberal attitude towards nudity in general. I’m not bothered by this, and honestly I’d never really had any experience that made me at all uncomfortable. 

I’ve lived here for a year with my girlfriend [F26], we’ve been together for two years. Last night we had her best friend and her boyfriend over to stay (they live a couple of hours away). We got drunk and went out, which we’ve done loads in the past, we’ve even been on holiday together and nothing like this has happened. We got home and I had just put a sheet on the sofa bed they were going to use. My girlfriend was in the bathroom and her best friends boyfriend was outside smoking. So I just sat down for a bit after getting the sofa bed ready. 

Her best friend comes in and is in her underwear. Again, this is something I’ve seen 100 times, nothing weird about it to me. We’re just talking a bit about the night etc. Nothing out of the ordinary. It’s whilst we’re talking that she takes her underwear off, facing me. I’ve never seen her naked before and I didn’t really know what to do. Her boyfriend was in my garden, my girlfriend was in the bathroom and I’m sat in my living room whilst her best friend is naked in front of me. She then got into her sleeping stuff and all was back to normal, I left the room and went to bed not long after. I didn’t really know what to say/if to say anything to my girlfriend.

Was this weird? I know I said about their attitude towards nudity, but I’m pretty certain my girlfriend wouldn’t do this. I just don’t know how to approach this, and if I’m looking into it too much. Any comment would be appreciated.

Tl;dr - girlfriends best friend got naked in front of me when we were drunk and her boyfriend and my girlfriend were both in the same house."
"My (30F) fiance (33M) and I have lived with my FMIL (60F) for a year and the arguments from it make him want to postpone our wedding, 3 weeks out. Advice?


Fiance (F) and I have been together for 2 years.  When we first started dating, we lived separate and then moved in together in a rental home. F's mom, M, who became a widow 2 years ago, approached him and asked if he would like to buy her home since it is too big for a woman living alone. We agreed this was a good move, and since our lease was up in Feb and we felt we would purchase it before another year passed, we all decided it was best for us to move in at that time and live with M while we set up purchasing the home from her.

These past 10 months have been...difficult. M wouldn't sell us the house until cosmetic renovations were done to it because she didnt like the way it looked. Those renovations took 4 months , and she still hasn't initiated the selling process, and when I try to, she says we have too much on our plate to deal with it now.

InAugust, F and I got engaged.  M is a bookkeeper and keeps F's books for him and encouraged us to get married by the end of the year to get the married tax break,  so we are, early next month. 

Ever since we got engaged, M has offered to help pay for a lot of it, which we dont need but are thankful for, but that comes with the price that M believes it should be done her way. She has made several backhanded comments about the things I suggest, saying the wedding doesn't have to be tacky or look bad, which I take offense to.

The closer we get to the wedding, the more she makes comments that I believe are targeted to hurt me. She will say things like we are not financially responsible to handle buying a house and she wont sell it to us until we are debt free (we both do government work, have savings and 401ks, and have credit scores well over 800), that we should consider me not changing my name or reporting that we got married on our taxes so we can file as single next year (wtf?), and has said to F when she thought that I wasn't listening  that she expects she wont be doing his bookkeeping anymore when we get married because I wont let her (I would prefer her not to because she keeps the other children's books and is constantly gossiping to us about their purchases and I dont want her to be so invasive or gossipy with my own).

Understandably, this has caused several arguments between F and I. I assumed this would be temporary, but now I feel like we are trapped living with M who is treating us like children about purchasing the home from her, which she asked us to do to alleviate her burdens, and has also grown jealous/resentful of F and my's relationship. F is always quick to defend his mother, and today we had an argument about how to best divide Thanksgiving time between both families, F got angry and said that he wants to postpone the wedding because ""all we do is fight now"" and ""we keep having to make decisions that stress us out"". I've tried to tell him my beliefs that the fighting occurs because of the stressful living environment,  but he insists that there isn't one and that I'm being negative, bitchy, and argumentative all the time ""for no reason "", and that planning a wedding is inherently stressful so that stress will never go away.

I have no clue what to do in this situation.  I would prefer not to have to call all of our guests and vendors and tell them that we are indefinitely postponing our marriage 3 weeks before the date.  What should we do? If anything similar has happened to you, what was the outcome?

TLDR: living with my FMIL has caused strain on our relationship, and now FH wants to postpone our wedding, less than a month from the day."
"Should I break up with my boyfriend even though I love him deeply

"Me [25 M] with my fiancé [23 F] of 2 years. I found out we're biologically related and I don't know what to do.

"My [22F] boyfriend [22M] has suicidal toughts daily. What should I do?


I would like advice on this. My boyfriend and I have been dating for 5 years. Through our relationship he always had depressive episodes, and would sometimes mention suicidal thoughts. When this happens, he sends me messages about wishing he was brave enought to end it all. Sometimes he says that he feels that I don't care about him, and I try to talk to him to know why. But he can never tell the reason why he feels like this, and he admits that he doesn't know anything I could do to make him feel better or more supported. Maybe there is something that I can do besides visiting him when I can and talking to him on the phone, but sometimes I think it has more to do with the lack of support he gets from his familly.

At this point I should mention that his relationship with his mother is absolutely horrible. I remember a time when they fought and he told her that she always treated him badly, and that he tried to comit suicide when he was a teenager. She said that he was too sensitive and pushed the guilt on him. His relationship with his father is not as bad, but they also have fights sometimes. His father is not very supportive and they aren't that close as well.

I've noticed that my boyfriend sends me these messages when something happens to make him feel worse. I told him over and over that he needs to see a professional and that things can't stay like this. But as soon as he calms down a little bit he says that everything is fine. He's very reluctant to the idea of using medication and even to seeing a terapist, but I already gave him the phone of a psychiatrist and a terapist just in case.

Today he went to visit his father and they had a fight. He started telling me that he feels so alone and that he wants to disapper. I talked to him and he ended up saying that he's been having suicidal toughts every day, which made me even more worried than I already was. For some reason I tought that it hadn't got to this point.

I would also like to say that the relationship is very good, despite my boyfriend's depression. He is sweet, caring and we rarely fight, but when we do we talk and mature. I see a therapist and I try to take care of myself so that the situation won't make me anxious, and so that I can understand the things I can do to help and the things he has to do himself.

But today's conversation made me think that he needs to get help urgently. I have a friend that tried to commit suicide and failed, and I didn't even know about her depression at that time. She almost died and I'm so scared that my boyfriend might be in this situation in the future, but I'm also fully aware that I cannot force him to see a terapist. I feel lost, is there something that I can do? I don't have the courage to ask if he has a plan for suicide, but I believe he is already in danger. Telling his mother is not an option, but I've considered telling his father,because I told my boyfriend to talk to him already. The truth is that I don't know if telling him would do any good. It seems that I would just be crossing the line and making my boyfriend angry, or maybe his father wouldn't help.

Please, any insights on this would be nice.

tl;dr - Boyfriend is sucidal and reluctant to get help. I don't know if there's something I can do."
"My friend (24M) of 8 years has a girlfriend (24F) who wants to be close friends with me (24F). After 3 months, I feel like she does not treat me well and I want distance. She messages/snapchats me near daily. Advice for how to do this without drama to our close-knit friendship group?


I am in a friendship group of about 15 people, even mix of boys and girls. We have all been friends since we were about 16. This girlfriend (let's call her Sara) started dating my friend(let's call him Ben) a little over a year ago, but I just moved back home and really got a chance to get to know her 5 months ago. She wanted to be friends right away, as she moved to our city so she didn't know anyone. I get how that feels so I was willing to reach out and be a friend. (She had lived here for about three months without reaching out to any other girls from our group, but asked about a friendship with me day 1 of me moving home).

&amp;#x200B;

She seemed to be trying really hard to impress me/be my friend in the beginning. She told me she was vegetarian (like me), but after a few months and continually seeing her eat meat at group gatherings she told me she changed her mind (part of me is curious if she possibly lied to impress me, probably not). She was nice in the beginning too, but slowly she became ruder and more passive aggressive with each hang out. At first I would tell myself that some people have rough personalities and that's okay, but I feel like it is just getting past that point. During hangouts I would literally be thinking ""well this is NOT going well, obviously we both are sensing this friendship is not working"" and totally assume she wouldn't want to hang out again. But lo and behold she would be trying to set up another hang out session for later that week. It made no sense.

&amp;#x200B;

Some examples:

* I moved into a new apartment, and the first time she saw it she walked around and didn't say anything nice. She only commented on how there was a lot of light coming from street lights and how her apartment is a lot darker and much more preferable for sleeping.
* She commented that my cat likes her better. (""joking"" but still)
* She will just point blank tell me I'm wrong about things, no discussion. An example, I told her I have always gotten my hair highlighted without bleach in the past (I'm a natural blonde so that's perfectly possible), but I'm thinking of stepping it up and doing bleach. She laughed like I'm an idiot and said ""well that's not possible, you've been using bleach"". .....It's MY hair.
* I offered her a dixie cup dispenser because I got an extra one in a set and didn't need my other one, and she condescendingly told me they don't use disposable cups and just use reusable ones. (...could have just said no thank you)
* I'm single, and she likes to randomly change the conversation going ""SO you been on any dates?"" even though I haven't ever told her I've been planning any dates, nor talking to anyone currently. I feel like she does this to rub in I'm single and just make me say no. (this could be me being oversensitive, but I swear I see glee in her eyes as she asks).
* She will go on and on complaining about her job and co-workers and I will listen, empathize, try to help with solutions, etc. If I ever try to vent about anything in my life that frustrates me to her she just won't respond, or just go 'uh-huh"". Once I told her about a guy who was kind of harassing me in the sauna and all she said ""well I would have left before I ever got myself in that situation"". Ummm thanks for letting me know you would have handled the situation better?
* Just in general mocking me for things. I can't even think of them right now because they are just so many small dumb things. I am not ashamed of being who I am and being a little bit weird sometimes, and she likes to point it out and try to make me feel embarrassed (it feels like to me).

Some things that aren't rude to me but just red flags:

* Ben makes good money, she told me his salary within 2 weeks of us hanging out (he is a really private guy, and I know he would not be okay with that). She also brought up to me how ""three people asked me if I date him for his money"", and she brings up his finances to me in some way literally every time we hang out. It's very uncomfortable and weird, and I'm not sure what she is fishing for me to say when she does it. When I have hung out with both of them a few times she has made snarky comments to him about money too. ""Well want to buy that for me?"" (in regards to expensive things), or once she was going on and on about how mean he is to her (which she does often to him in baby talk) and she told him he was making a mean face at her. Ben replied ""Babe it is just my face, what do you want me to get plastic surgery or something"" and she said ""Not like you couldn't afford it"" and he was taken aback and said ""well not really"" and she rolled her eyes and said ""that's debatable, we can talk about THAT later"". Sorry for the tangent, but just really WTF to me. (She also is way TMI about her wage, and how much she pays of the rent, etc)
* Ben didn't want a cat, Sara convinced him to get one a few months ago. Ben told me Sara told him cats only live to 12 years (they adopted a 10 year old). She volunteers with cats weekly, and I am nearly certain she wouldn't be mistaken on a cat's life expectancy (more like 17+ sometimes can be in the low 20s). I think she may have lied to him to manipulate him into getting a cat.
* She moved in with ben pretty fast (her own words) and she went on this huge story to me about how her step mom was super verbally abusive (cornering her and screaming at her irrationally) so she had to move out to get out of there, she went so far as to say that she thinks her step mom has psychiatric problems and that her dad will likely divorce her. That was 3 months ago, but she told me that she is getting matching tattoos with her stepmom and acts like they are best friends. I wonder if she lied/blew out of proportion the stuff with her stepmom to move in quickly with Ben?
* She told me two stories in the past where she admitted to cheating on a SO (one being Ben) both times she backtracked and claimed she was mistaken and mixed up her timelines. The Ben story: started with her saying this was when her and Ben first started dating and she was still in college, she went out to the bars with her best friend. The story ended with them going to a club and having this crazy fun night, then going home and calling her best friend's boyfriend for a threesome. She was saying how she hooked up with the girl but changed her mind right before having sex with the guy. Once she realized I wasn't responding she told me that her and Ben weren't officially dating, but had just started talking (so that could be true).

I'm sorry, I know all the stuff about Ben isn't my business and I won't be sticking my nose in it. I just added it because I feel like it adds to why I don't like her as a person and don't want to be her friend/think she is unstable. But I'm also genuinely sad/concerned a bit for Ben. But I know there really is nothing I can do, he has to work through his relationships on his own.

&amp;#x200B;

Of note, Ben and I made out at a party when we were like 18 once while drunk. It meant nothing, we didn't date or hook up continually after. In a group like ours going through high school and early college that shit just happens and did happen with a lot more people than just him and I. I didn't want to ever just randomly bring it up like ""oh heyyy just so you know I made out with your boyfriend 6 years ago"", but I would HOPE Ben was wise enough to tell her, so let's assume she knows.

&amp;#x200B;

I am the only single girl in the group right now (one single guy currently as well). Part of me wonders if that is why she latched on to me? Maybe she felt threatened by me being single and wanted to keep an eye on me? I'm not sure, but at this point it doesn't matter, every time I spend time with her it ends with me feeling worn out, annoyed, and irritated. I have never in my life had someone act like this. It is just so bizarre how she acts like she wants to be such great friends and wants to hang out with me but seems to genuinely dislike me.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm sorry this became such a huge rant, I have been holding in a lot more resentment than I initially realized once I started typing this out. You become the people you hang out with, and I don't want to become rude/snarky (and I fear I am because it is getting hard to bite my tongue to some of the comments she makes). I have stopped initiating any sort of contact with her for weeks now. She has slowed down on messaging/ snapping me but it still comes at least every other day. I feel awkward just ignoring someone so much, and the last thing I want to do is cause drama in our tight knit group (of note, two girls from the group told me they think she is mean and don't like her). Also, based on a lot of things she has told me I don't feel like she is the most stable. Is it better for me to continue to ignore? I'm scared it's going to lead to a freak out from her. I am thinking about telling her I just don't feel like we click well? But I'm scared that would be a freak out as well. I've never had to drop a friend like this before, any advice?

&amp;#x200B;

tl;dr Friend of 8 years has a girlfriend who wants to be close friends with me, but she doesn't treat me well. I want distance, but I fear causing drama in out group."
"I [24F] consistently dream about my (now ex) boyfriend's [28M] ex wife


(I apologize for the long post, first of all!) 

&amp;#x200B;

I started dating my ex boyfriend about a year and a half ago (we dated for a year), about six months after he came out of a relationship of 3 years. He is from Europe, his ex is American, they got married so that he could stay in the US and they could continue their relationship. He doesn't see the point in marriage, to him it's purely utilitarian, she wanted more and saw it as a step forward in their relationship. 

Fast forward to their breakup, she was a bit abusive towards him (or so I was told), she broke it off with him. He was there for her a few months later when she was assaulted. When we started dating, he would still meet with her every now and then to have drinks and discuss updates in the divorce situation. Honestly I wish I had not put up with this, but it was my first relationship and I didn't know how to stick up for myself. He had to hold off on getting divorced so that it wouldn't affect his green card status, but that she was temperamental and he said he needed to keep her happy as when she was upset she would threaten to file for divorce and turn him in to immigration. Obviously, this bothered me. She would still reach out to him now and then, and he was nice but gradually begin distancing himself. But during this time when he was still trying to please her, he wouldn't tell people (except his close friends) he was dating someone, and lied to his coworkers that he was still married because he was paranoid about his green card situation, he wouldn't break me to social events he went to. This made me more insecure, but as he got past this, he loosened up and eventually let me into his life completely (after many meltdowns and arguments on my end) without any problems. However, because his time in the US has been only with her, she is his frame of reference for his time here, and so he refers to his experiences with her and her family. It got a lot better after I began getting super upset at him for doing this, and he rarely does this anymore. During the last few months of our relationship, I forced him to tell her I exist and he eventually filed for divorce after speaking to a lawyer. 

&amp;#x200B;

However, I am still (even after our breakup--my insecurity over this played a big role in my breaking up with him) jealous and insecure about her, even though he very much doesn't have feelings for her anymore and would never go back to her. I have recurring dreams about meeting this woman and being upset. Even the mention of her name, wherever I go, upsets me. Even if it's a random person I meet. 

&amp;#x200B;

I can't figure out why I'm so hung up on this. Is it normal to be so upset as to have these dreams? Any ideas as to why I can't seem to get past this? I've spoken to him about the situation numerous, numerous times and he's apologized for how he handled everything. I want for this to not bother me anymore, and I even would want to get back together, but I can't seem to move on. 

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR: I have recurring upsetting dreams about my boyfriend's ex wife. Is this normal? Why does this keep happening even after he's apologized? How do I get past this?"
"Boyfriend isn't sure if he loves me


(Throwaway account)

My boyfriend (19M) of 1.5 years and I (20F) are going through a rough patch. He struggles with mental health issues and has tried to break up with me before because he feels he doesn't deserve a relationship. He recently told me he doesn't know if he loves me (but cares deeply about me) and wants to break up because he doesn't want to commit for longer and then find out its not right. My view is this is something we should work together on as a couple and both put effort into solving. For context, things were great before this and came completely out of the blue, and I think that it stems from his mental health again. I have talked to mutual friends and we think he just isn't sure what love is to him and needs time to figure it out. Should I try to salvage things and make the argument that it isn't fair that he's just springing this on me out of nowhere and wants it to be over and that we should work on this together, or is it not worth it at this point? I really love him and want to be together. 

  
TLDR: Boyfriend isn't sure if he loves me but doesn't want to try to figure it out. I think we should work on it together. "
"My (20M) relationship feels 'too secure'?


 

Hi, I've got a fairly common problem I'd like to receive advice on. I think alot of people will be in a similar boat to me so it will be interesting to see replies.

I'm 20 years old and have been dating a girl for the past 2 years (she is also 20). Its great, we have fun together, enjoy spending time with each other and know each others families well.

The problem is that I cant help but feeling like I'm missing out. I've only slept with 7 people, and had serious relationships with only 1 girl before her. I feel like I'm a bit trapped with my gf right now; we have no reason to break up and I dont see one coming any time soon. Sure its great, but I can't help but feel like I should be out dating and speaking to more girls before I settle with one.

I'd like to hear peoples thoughts on whether you are better to a) stay with a decent relationship or b) roll the dice and explore what else is out there. if I was 8 years older I'd be damn set on settling, but I'm only 20 years old so I'm not so sure

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR: Should you stay in a good relationship at 20, or roll the dice and see what other girl are out there

"Guy[25M] I’ve [24F] been dating had a bday bash and didn’t invite me


Gonna make this short and sweet. Guy I’m dating had an all day bday party. We’ve been dating about a month and talk every single day and he didn’t invite me which I guess is fine since he isn’t ready for me to meet his friends? I actually even helped him plan it and find a place to celebrate.

I texted him happy birthday and he didn’t text me back all day but I saw on Instagram he was doing shots all day with people. 

I know I sound super needy and exaggerating but I feel like he could’ve at least said thank you and texted me hello. Do I at all have a right to be slightly annoyed?

**TL;DR** - guy I’ve been dating for a month had a bday bash and didn’t invite me or respond to  my happy birthday wish. Do I have a right to be annoyed?"

TLDR: This sub has actually given me the strength to start the leaving process (aggaaiiiin) tonight. When I saw him deleting text messages and my gut said, do it! I left, no fight.  Similar experience? Anyone get over betrayal? Love later in life?

1️⃣3 months in, I got a surprise. Straight betrayal. Denied it but saw pills under paper in trashcan. Liar. Still denies 

2️⃣2 years in, doing laundry and found 2 condoms in his pocket. Durex. Gas station ones. “He has no earthly idea how they got there.” Sidenote: they come in 3 packs. 

3️⃣Alcoholic. Handle of crown-36 hour shelf life


4️⃣Mean drunk. Cruel. 

5️⃣Friends (married- 1 had cheated multiple times) come over every day. To get away from their married life. Drink and play cornhole (40+Ms) every. Day. (He wonders why I haven’t moved in after 4 years worth of his attempts)

6️⃣90/10 sure he cheated a year ago. He owns a business and says there is always the relationship flirty atmosphere. Yyeeeaaaahh. He thinks his charm makes up for his horrible managing skills. That’s fair? Right? Totally respectful to me? Right? Umm no....plus, see 5️⃣

🆒Oh, wanna know what’s worse? We have our own place and jobs, so no dependency concerns either!! 
Clean break.
However, I have developed comfort in his companionship and I don’t want to live a life without a companion...I’m desperate and ashamed for that. I am petrified for a solo future. It’s so hard for me to be vulnerable. Took a long time for me to open up.

Thought I could get feedback 
a ‘do not look back’ ‘he did it 90/10= 100/0, duh’

"My [33m] now ex gf [25f] exchanged numbers with a guy at a club and has started dating him


We have been together four months. Last Friday we got into a fight, and that evening she went out to a club with some of her friends. The next night, we had a conversation and she decided to end the relationship. The reasons for the end of the relationship were valid, as we both had been pretty unhappy for a bit. Still, I wasn't ready to throw in the towel so I did try to pursue her and show her that I thought we could overcome the arguments. 

I gave her space for the weekend, but then during the week we started spending time together again. We would discuss the relationship very calmly, talking about where things went wrong, how they could possibly be fixed, etc... We were intimate. It was fairly confusing, for me, at least, because I was still holding on to the possibility of us being together but even while being intimate with me (sex, closeness, cuddling, deep conversation), she was adamant about needing the relationship to end for there ever to be a chance for us in the future.

This happened a few times over the week. While she was claiming that we were broken up, we were still very much acting like nothing had really changed. Last night, after things had been progressing pretty well and I could tell she was softening to the idea of us being together, we spent a nice evening chatting, cuddling, etc... As we were heading to bed I checked the time on her phone and she had a message from someone I had recently noticed her connecting with on IG. I casually asked who it was and her demeanor changed completely.

She was always very open with me about her phone. She would let me see messages if I ever showed interest, gave me the phone to check something for her, etc... When I brought up this message she stiffened up and refused to discuss it. She said he was a friend she met at the club the previous Friday. I was pretty angry and accusatory at this point, and after a few minutes, she half-admitted that I wouldn't be happy about the messages because ""I know how you get, and you might think we were being flirty.""

She finally gave in and let me see the conversation. Her face was flushed. They went to breakfast Sunday morning and then made plans to get dinner when he gets back in town in a couple of days. One message from her read ""I can't wait to see you again."" He called her cute and pretty in a couple texts. After prodding, she told me ""I don't know how I feel about him,"" and ""I didn't expect him to be so sweet,"" and even, ""I don't find him attractive."" (This dude is, objectively, a stone-cold stunner.)

I was pretty upset, so I decided to leave. She blocked me from leaving for several minutes and begged me to stay, to spend one more night with her, to have the nice evening we were planning, etc... She finally let me go. I didn't want to. I really wanted this woman. I wanted her to say the kinds of things to me again that she had been sending this guy.

My question for y'all: How do I proceed? She told me repeatedly over the last week that she wasn't interested in dating someone else, that she was focusing on her studies and being better. She even blatantly lied to me about meeting anyone at the club that night when I asked her about it. I can't get over the fact that we were still together when she danced with this guy and exchanged numbers.

How should I feel? How should I move on? Should I just block her across the board and begin to move on? We were being intimate all week while she was texting this guy and planning dates. Should I discuss it with her and try to salvage the little bit that's left? Am I making this into more than it actually is? Do I even have a right to be upset at all? Help, reddit!

&amp;#x200B;

tl;dr: My girlfriend exchanged numbers with a guy at a club while we were together, lied about it, and has started casually dating, texting and flirting with him all while her and I are still maintaining the same relationship as before, without the official label. I am unsure of how to proceed."
"My [28] boyfriend [29] becomes furious when I ask about him cheating and shames me for wanting details or feeling bad about it Relationships


About two weeks ago a girl sent me 200 pages of my boyfriend's alleged sexting with her including naked photos and videos of him masturbating. I found it really distressing. He says it's all fake and she hacked his cloud. I decided that I can never know if it's true or not so I forgave him as I love him. A handful of times since she contacted me last week I brought the issue up with him and said we needed to talk about it but he goes absolutely ballistic, shuts down and refuses. He then shames me for asking.

He says that I am obsessed with this and that I am going to keep bring up this issue and pull it out for the rest of our lives so we might as well go our separate ways but then does not break up with me. He then says that I am never going to forget it and every time we have a fight I will bring it up for the rest of our lives. He has made this all up in his head.

In reality this all only happened two weeks ago, I think I deserve at least one proper conversation about it and I have only brought it up about four times, each time asking him for clarification and details. He is making it out to be that I am in the wrong here and he even said that I had disturbed his peace of mind today by asking about it and that I am never going to give it up. I told him that no matter what happened I am willing to work on this if he is honest with me.

On one hand I feel like if he is innocent maybe he feels that I should have believed him, but on the other hand I feel like even if he is innocent he should be willing to have a conversation with me about it and to reassure me. All he will say is that he did talk to this girl, but it was for work and she just became obsessed with him.

I feel so bad for being shamed for just wanting to talk about what happened. He says he does not want to talk about it aside from saying it didn't happen and she was a stalker.

He got really angry with me to the point of shouting today (and shouted at me the other times I asked too) because I said I still felt bad about what happened and he became enraged and said he was feeling ""calm"" today but I then ruined that by asking about her. He does not understand that I would feel bad about this. When I say how much it hurt me to see the texts and photos even if they were fake and how much it made me feel sick, he just says ""What about me? It made me feel bad too!"" He can't see beyond himself.

Am I in the wrong? I feel like I should be able to ask him about this at least once. I don't want to talk about it forever, just think we need to have some discussion about it. I feel like if it's fake then he should understand how bad I feel about it all. He is now ignoring me and won't answer his phone because I disturbed his ""calm"" today.

I am extremely upset, please help.

tl;dr - boyfriend allegedly cheated and becomes furious when I ask about it or express how bad I feel."
"Girlfriend [23F] getting hit on and I [19M] dont know how to feel.


I'm writing this because all my thoughts are frankly in a jumble and I need to get my thoughts and feelings in order.

My girlfriend and I (LDR see each other every 2 weeks) have been going out for 2 months, this is my first relationship and she's older. That being said, I've been finding out how to act in a relationship whilst also trying to keep a mature outlook in order to not ruin the relationship and to develop the way I think and feel.

Whenever we're together, things are amazing. I always feel really good about being with her and it's warm and fuzzy feelings most of the time. She always cares about me and goes the extra mile to show that she's always thinking about me and always trying her best to make me happy. I know she cares about me so deeply and that her heart is massive.

However, it all started with a guy on her course hitting on her, at first it was subtle and then it started to become more and more obvious, getting her phone number from the course groupchat, winky faces, goodmorning/goodnight texts. I started becoming a bit paranoid but stopped myself early and thought ""Im the one in the relationship, he's the one trying. She clearly chose me."" and was able to stop that train of thought pretty early.

Things kept escalating, he came in with starbucks for her one day, kept offering to walk her home everyday (as they live close by) etc and even bought her a bouquet of flowers for her birthday. She said she'll talk to him about him hitting on her when he delivers it, but never got the chance to as he gave it to her and walked away. Throughout this, we joke around with it saying ""oh go with your new boyfriend"" etc, as I dont want to seem insecure about it and she's reassured me that he's irrelevant.

She's dropped hints that she has a boyfriend to him, but he clearly doesnt care and keeps trying with her. She keep saying ""maybe he wants to be friends"", but its really obviously different and I've even told her to stop lying to herself and realise what his intentions are. She knows for sure. She also knows that I'm not happy when he does stuff for her, but what can I do being this far away.

When we were together, he was still messaging her and saying things like if she wants to go out to a christmas market. She kept saying no (as she was with me that whole weekend), but she'll let him know if plans change and (she doesnt want to be rude to him). At one point she muted the chat, when I asked why, she said she didnt want me to overthink it.

Recently, she went out to the christmas market with her coursemates and he was there of course, they all went to the bar after and he was the one talking to her constantly. After the bar, he offered her an uber home (again they live quite close together) and she said she'll take the bus. He kept insisting and she said yes, he wanted to drop her off at her house first, but she left the uber when she was close enough to walk home.

Today, he winked at her in the lecture. Theres many other incidents that make it obvious, but its too many and I dont want to drown this post.

I know she loves me and I know she wouldn't betray my love, but I've made it clear to her that I dont like it when he does stuff like that, but I really dont ever want to be the controlling type of boyfriend. At first I wanted to know everything that was happening with this guy, but now I told her to just tell me what she feels like telling me. She clearly doesnt think its a big deal because I'm the one she wants to be with and the other guys are irrelevant.

I feel like shit though, like I feel like shit for feeling like shit. She isnt the type of person to put make confrontations about this type of thing to him, so I dont think she'll shut him down, but she knows I dislike it and it just keeps happening everyday. She just says ""let him think what he wants"". When she sent me a goodnight text after the whole bar event, it was filled with love but I somehow took the bad parts of the message. ""After talking to my admirer and coursemates, I know I love you completely and I wouldnt trust anyone else"", but for some reason, I took the ""After talking to my admirer"" bit in a bad way like ""Oh so she was unsure until she talked to him more"" kinda thing.

 I hate myself for even thinking like this and I hate that most of our conversation are even about this goon nowadays. I hate that I'm feeling like im holding something back when talking to her on the phone or that something just isnt right, I just dont know how to make sense of it all and I just dont know how to even talk to her about this, because I'm tired of making a big deal out of this guy. I feel like I've been smiling less and acting a bit distant on our phonecalls. I love her so much, I just dont know what to do and I dread that I might be distancing myself because of this.

tl;dr: Girlfriend gets hit on by guy constantly, he's trying to escalate it. I dont know what to say, how to respond or even how I feel.

Sorry for the wall of text, any help is appreciated."
"Should I (29M) tell my boyfriend (26M) that my previous relationship (22M) ended with a fight?


So I had been dating a guy for about 3 years and he cheated on me, it was a serious relationship, or at least I thought so. Things got violent right before we broke up and I did things to get back at him later.

It's been many months since that. I've been dating someone new for a few weeks and I'm happy and I don't want to scare him away so I'm torn between never telling him a word about that, thinking that maybe the past is irrelevant (with the risk of him finding out from someone else), or telling him a softened version of the truth which doesn't make me look crazy. I'm trying to figure out what to do.

If I was sure he could never find out on his own I would never tell him, but I'm somewhat known in my town and it might one day become public.

I read the rules. I'm not advocating, suggesting or justifying violence, I know what I did was wrong and it's never okay to hit someone, but it happened and I'll always live with that, because there are people who know. I'd take it back if I could.

TL;DR Should I tell my new boyfriend I hit my ex before we broke up? How can I do that without scaring him?"
"why would a guy (29M) keep asking me (38F) out on dates each time I reach out to him but would not text first?


Basically, I (38F) had a couple of dates with a guy (29M) I met online who would never text first but whenever I texted him, he would ask me out and we'll have a lovely time. I'm not used to having no contact between dates. After a few I got fed up and stopped reaching out first to see if he would but he never did. Is it a control issue? Is it because he's significantly younger than me?  Just not into me? Anyway it's just perplexing more than anything else. It's almost like he read The Rules for guys or something lol. What do u guys think?

Tldr: why would a guy keep asking me out on dates each time I reach out to him but would not text first?"
"I (19f) think I want to go home, but fear leaving BF (30m) in the dust


This is a long read, but there's a lot of context to my current situation that needs said. 


I (19f) found myself in a relationship with a (30m) guy poly guy already in a 15 year relationship with a (35m) guy (For the record, no cheating has ever happened and we all have always known about each other), moved 2000 miles to be with him two years into the relationship, and 9 months later, I'm finally trying to accept that this won't work.


How did I find myself in this situation? Years of isolation, bullying, a poor and stressful home life, graduating high school four years early and then falling into a depression chasm preventing me from going to college,  and a previous abusive ex of three years. I became my mother and fell for someone who could set me free from this... the difference being that Mom and Dad's age gap is two years, they are both monogamous, and they are still married after several decades. 


We met online as just friends, and at the time, I was still with a shitty boyfriend (shitty meaning: threatening me, putting me down constantly, blackmailing, etc), upset with my home life, and lonely as all fuck. We spoke more and more and he finally confessed that he liked me, and I confessed back. We were into a lot of the same things, shared extremely similar viewpoints on things like politics and life and death and people, he was hilarious and smart, he thought I was interesting and cute, neither of us were interested in sex or sexting, he was there for me when I needed him and came to me with his own problems, etc etc. His other relationship never seemed to invade ours, so it was never a concern. The other guy felt more like a free friend. I didn't care if they were affectionate to each other, because I got affection, too. 


There finally came a point where he invited me to live with him, hoping I'd be in a better situation, but I said I wanted to meet him first, so we made several trips over the course of a year until I finally worked up the courage to leave. Problem was, by the time that came around, I was already becoming miserable in the relationship. The distance was way too hard... mostly because he started leaving me hanging. Sometimes for a week at a time. He'd ignore my messages and I'd have to resort to begging for him to just tell me what was wrong. It was never anything with me, mind you, but he was still completely shutting me out in times of stress. This was happening more and more, contrary to the first few months of our relationship, where we spoke every day and he opened up to me and showed constant interest. He'd also break his promises to call me (which was hard enough to get him to do as it was. He's a texter), and never once wrote me a letter back. 


So that all should have been a huge red flag, and it was, but I'm someone who is terrified of being alone, so I held on tightly. Things were so great when I visited that I thought ""well, if I'm there, he literally can't ignore me for a week, right?"" I saw moving in as the solution to our relationship issues. And it worked, for about four months. I didn't have a bedroom at first, so the two didn't make me pay rent, only my share of utilities/internet/food. I got alone time with him and so did his other partner. Things felt good, I was in the city (not NYC but a big one), I had two people in my life who I loved and who were fun to be around, and a low stress job. 


Then I gave the go to sign a lease, move into a two bedroom, and pay my share of rent. I really ended up being blindsided by the cost of living, seeing as I have really no adulting experience (I paid rent at home, but it was always relative to how much I was making, never a fixed amount). I owe about $1000 in bills and food money a month. My job made me about $1100 a month, so I was very quickly working my ass off for rent only and growing exhausted with it. I simultaneously found myself wanting a car (I can't drive at the moment) and a college education, and when I was already living paycheck to paycheck, that clearly wasn't possible. I wanted to volunteer at the local animal shelter, but a change in availability meant a cut in hours. I wanted an emotional service cat to help my depression/anxiety, but their dog isn't okay with other animals. I wanted to go to therapy, but again, cost and availability. I started looking for new jobs, applying for probably a hundred or so, but nowhere wants me for full time, and nowhere I can take on as a second job likes my availability, seeing as I need to keep weekends at my current job. Take in mind my options are limited by a lack of transportation. As it is, I walk 1.5 miles to work. 


Then I got a new, better job, quit my old one with a moment's notice so I could immediately attend my first day, and immediately realized I couldn't work this one for reasons not told in the job description. So I stressed out, sold shit on ebay to pay rent, finally got another new job this past week, and I'm already fucking miserable working it. 


At the same time that all started, things were going downhill with my bf. He stopped hanging out with me alone, started misinterpreting my body language as me angry/upset with him (despite that never ever being the case), and I no longer felt like I could discuss anything important with him without him getting upset or just ignoring me completely. He completely stopped reaching out if I was upset, citing self care, but he's said before to ask him if he's okay when he's upset. The last time we even cuddled was a month ago, and then another month before that. I've come to the sudden realization that I misinterpreted being an equal partner to his S/O, and I've had to rewrite him in my head as just a friend, which hurts so bad because he's so much more than that to me. 


He and his roommate are still so nice to me, though. We still sit on the couch and play xbox all day, we still cook dinner together and they buy me things and they provided me with shelter all this time. We talk about going to Disneyland next year and conventions and neat restaurants. Christmas-time is hard for my bf and he assures me things will get better. Our lease still has until May, and they'd be stuck covering my share if I leave. So I feel like a huge asshole!!!! Like I should stick it out and I'm throwing away the best friends I'll ever have. But I'm stressed and broke, and if I move back home, I'll be lonely and miserable with more money and the chance to go to school potentially even this Spring. 


But I don't want to lose my literal only friends. I'm already so lonely.  


But I can't even talk to them about the things I want to talk about. 


Basically, what's your perspective on this situation? I don't need to be told I'm stupid, I know the weight of my actions. I just need to know a perspective that isn't 19 years old, lonely, guilty, conflicted, and terrified.

tldr; I (19f) moved states to be with boyfriend (30m), unprepared for real world and want to go home but so scared of throwing away something good and being lonely and guilty for the rest of my life. "

"Me [33F] with my bf [31M], 10 months, my low self-esteem and insecurities are building a wall between us


I grew up in a small town where sexually shaming girls were extremely common. Most of us teens here became sexually active at a young age, and we shouldnt have, but whats done is done. I had sex with my boyfriend and during a few years there was a few hookups, I was too young and too vunerable, but ""everybody was doing it"". The biggest problem was the shaming that followed, everybody was allowed to look down on you, even the guy you slept with. Most girls had the self esteem to dont let it affect them, but for me its still a little voice in my head telling me im dirty, after so many years. 

After those episodes in my teens I learned to be more careful, but I am a sexual human being, Ive had several relationships and hookups and romances after that.
But every time Ive had sex this little voice from my teens come back in my head ""youre dirty and nobody is going to want you now"". And it gets especially bad when I fall in love. I keep thinking, what if he really knew what I am like? What if he knew how dirty I am? 

I would never ever think or feel this way about somebody else, I know that sex it natural and I really dont give a shit about what other people does in their own time. As an adult Ive learned that most of us have their own little secrets.

And my guy, he is no Mother Teresa. We had the past relationship talk, and he said ""I dont care about ONS, I just want to know about your story"". And that is nice, that is what I want. But I keep feeling this shame. And I have flashbacks from my teens from being shamed, and I keep thinking, one of these days somebody is going to come up to him and say ""what are you doing with that woman, let me tell you what shes really like"".

I have no idea how to handle this. I feel like Im building a wall between us because I feel more and more ashamed. I keep playing over and over in my head every regret I have, every guy Ive ever been with, every hookup, and I feel so bad about myself.
Nobody has ever tried to ruin a relationship for me, I think most people does not want to ruin things for others, and on some level I even think that if somebody ever told him ""Ive had a ONS with your girl"" he would think they are the idiot, not me.

But what triggered this whole thing is that I actually had a little messy hookup a few months before I met him. I had gotten out of a long term relationship a few months before, and I was very vunerable. I can forgive myself for doing this at a younger age, but it feels like Im too old to make mistakes like that now.

I have no idea how to handle this. I just expect that any time now he is going to find out about the ""real me"". But I dont know. Am I paranoid because of experiencing shaming in my teens? Or am I really as bad and filthy as I feel?

We have such a good relationship else, we have so much in common, we both have good jobs and loving families and friends and this could be sooo good if I just could relax a little more and be happy in my own skin.

tldr; I dont know if Im damaged because of experiences in my youth, or if I really just deserve to feel bad about myself "
"Help me [24F] choose which guy I should continue to date and which guy I should break it off with [M25,28]


So I’m gonna try to keep this simple, sorry for any weird formatting I’m on my mobile phone. I’ve been dating two guys for a little over a month now. We haven’t discussed being exclusive so I’m technically not doing anything wrong but this is SO not my MO and I really would like to break it off with one of them and just date one. I would also like to mention that this has never happened to me, I usually have the worst dating luck. Not sure how I got here ...

So here’s a profile of both guys:

**Guy 1: 28M**

Pros: he’s a doctor (very smart which is a huge turn on for me). Same cultural upbringing, kind, always walks me to my car at the end of the night, same love of traveling, family, both foodies, etc.

Cons: he’s a surgery resident and never has time to hang out and we never talk during the day, just share a few texts all day. When we do hang out he’s super tired which I totally get, but it’s not something I’m used to. I’m afraid that in the future he won’t be able to attend a lot of my family and friend events (birthday, weddings, etc) and I’ll always be upset that he’s not there. He also tried to have sex on our first date, I said no and he respected it but it still gave me a weird vibe. Lives about an hour from me. Doesn’t drink (I love drinking) 


**Guy 2: 24M**

Pros: engineer, also very sweet, drives me home after every date so I don’t pay for a cab (I live 35 mins away), texts me all day and asks how my day is and tells me about his, is very close to his family, we’ve definitely had more conversations and seen each other more than the doctor. Is more open about his feelings. 

Cons: he’s an engineer (I’m also an engineer and he sometimes wants to talk about work since I would understand his struggles but I like to leave work and not talk about it anymore ...)
He’s a slightly more cocky then I would personally like him to be which is both attractive and annoying (he has a really good job but still), he mentioned doing coke in the past and made it sound like it’s not a big deal but I’m not into that. He was engaged before but I only found out through some hard core instagram creeping and he hasn’t mentioned it to me (maybe isn’t ready?), had a birthday bash that I wasn’t invited to (which is fine I guess) and I didn’t hear from him in 48 hours...

**TL;DR** - dating two very different guys but would like to break it off and only date one. Based on the pros and cons which should I choose?"
"Girlfriend (F23) and I (M24) can't decide what to do for Christmas, my family is not helping


Hi Reddit, I'm just here for some outside perspective.

My girlfriend and I are trying to organize what to do for Christmas but have hit a wall. Normally, we spend Christmas separately with our families, but this year my girlfriend wants to spend Christmas together as a couple. We've been together for just over 2 years. Also, we both live in a different country to our families so we can't go see them without spending a lot on flights.

For a bit of background, my girlfriend had to go back to her country a few months ago for a wedding. I was able to take some time off work then, so we decided to go together so I could meet her family and see where she's from. I stayed at their home and I think I made a good impression and her parents like me. We had a lot of fun and I would go back.

Now we're talking about Christmas and she mentioned spending Christmas with my family instead of doing things separately because she went back to her country recently and doesn't feel the need to see her family again so soon. I thought this was a good idea, but when I brought it up with my parents, they weren't so supportive and said it would be better if we spent Christmas just as a family this year. Apparently my dad has been having some health problems lately and they have never actually met my girlfriend in person yet because we started dating overseas, so I think having a new person over during the holidays (even if it is my girlfriend) would be a bit too stressful. Also, they don't have a spare bed and some other issues.

I really want to go back and spend Christmas with my family as I haven't seen them in over a year, but I also want to spend it with my girlfriend because it's important to her. My girlfriend was really excited to finally be able to visit and introduce herself so she's pretty upset that they don't want her there (understandably). She says they're being unfair because her parents had no problems hosting me and thinks we can work out a way to make it happen. I haven't been able to book any flights yet because she keeps bringing it up and trying to change my/their mind. Parents are still saying no so I'm stuck in the middle. I don't feel like it's my place to say yes and bring her anyway because it's their house/Christmas and not mine anymore.

She suggested going back to her country to spend it with her family, but I feel like that would be a bit unfair to my family. So we're trying to compromise and go somewhere else but I also feel guilty about that. Christmas has always been a family holiday to me as we have a lot of traditions and it wouldn't feel right without me there? I would probably be pretty homesick.

But now I don't know how to keep both parties happy or what I should do really. How do you compromise at the holidays? And do you think I'm being selfish for wanting to go back and leaving my girlfriend here?

&amp;#x200B;

Tl;dr: Live abroad and don't know who to spend Christmas with. My family doesn't want to host girlfriend, now I'm stuck in the middle."
"I (24F) want a divorce but my husband (29M) won’t give me space to think about if I want a divorce.


We’ve been married for two years. On every single occasion, my birthday, valentine’s day or our anniversary - he made me cry. The beginning of our marriage was awful. Random bouts of verbal abuse. Slowly but surely I stopped caring about him or how he feels. I stopped cooking for him, stopped doing laundry etc. he’s not nearly as bad as he was in the beginning but the other night he accused me of cheating, which I wasn’t. At the start of our marriage he made me share my location with him at all times. I told him that I wasn’t cheating, and he didn’t believe me. I left the house and went to stay at a hotel. Finally he promised that he would leave the house. So I came back. Now he’s back in the house because he begged me. 

I care about him deeply but he’s making it very difficult for me to think about our marriage. I want this to end but he’s not respecting my boundaries. Even if I do decide to end this, how do I pack my stuff without him breathing down my neck? Is it possible to care about someone but not want to have sex with him? Every time we have sex I feel disgusted.


Should I stay should I go? I’m conflicted and not sure how to go about this situation in an adult fashion. 

TD;LR my husband is making it difficult for me to think about our marriage. He won’t give me space and he’s trying to frame this whole situation like he’s the victim. What do I do? "
"I (F22) am miserable in my relationship with M26 because he won't moderate how much time he spends gaming.


Well, my boyfriend and I have been together for 3 nearly 4 years and living together for 2 nearly 3 years.

Initially it was great, everything you'd hope living together would be but once he got comfortable with living with me he stopped hanging out and started playing video games as often as he did prior to being in a relationship. 

I've tried to suck it up, get hobbies, go out with friends, play with him and talk to him about how it makes me feel alone and abandoned; these provide a little change for a few weeks but it seems as though nothing can stop him from playing from the moment he gets home from work till he is too tired to play anymore. On the weekends he will play for literally 16 hours a day (I've timed him). 

It's not only the gaming thing, I really think I could put up with if there weren't other things bothering me so much in our relationship. 

He is a poor communicator when it comes to serious things. Like when I confront him (very gently because I'm not a confrontational person) about playing too much, he will just shrug and be like 'Sorry, what do you want me to do?' to which I'd say something along the lines of 'try playing 4-6 hours and then spending time together, or playing 4 nights a week instead so we've got time together' and he'll agree and do it for a week and then since I'm not whinging at him he'll go back to normal. This is a conversation I've had with him a million times. 

His personal hygiene is questionable and grosses me out to the point where I won't engage with him sexually anymore. I don't want to have sex when our bedroom is a mess and he hasn't had a shower. Again, spoken about and he can't even do that. 

He's lazy and unmotivated and I often feel like his mum. I do 95% of the house work and all of the cooking. We both work full time. 

Anyway, I've been wanting to break up with him for a long time (2ish years), but we live together and I'd feel really guilty.. also I'm kind of afraid to be alone, but I feel like I'm wasting my life waiting for him to spend his with me (I've said that to him once, he said 'well that's a bit over dramatic, which hurt me very deeply because I'd been trying for months to find an impacting truth to describe my feelings and he just shrugged it off). 

I'm a strong person, but this relationship makes me feel like a broken woman. So:

1. Do I give him more chances to work it out?
2. How do you break up with someone you live with? 
3. How do I stop myself from feeling guilt about not wanting to be with him anymore. 

Or just any other general advice about this kind of thing. 

Thank you guys. 

tldr - boyfriend plays video games 16+ hours on weekends, is lazy, a poor communicator and dismisses my feelings. want to break up, feel guilty and don't know how."
"I [24 M] broke up with my GF [22 F] of 2 years because of her parents


The last 2 years we really had a very good relationship and I couldn't have thought of a better girlfriend. We lived 15 minutes away from eachother but for her studies in another city about 550 km away from where we lived she moved back in with her parents. I was very sceptical of her decision because I feared her parents would interfere with our relationship and that my GF would be patronized by her parents. Turns out I was right.

I've got a lot of free time and enough money to visit her on a regular basis as she got little because of her studies. She told me that her parents wouldn't be okay with that as they think I'm not a family guy and weren't accepting me because of ridiculous things like appearing with sleep in the eyes to the breakfast. Before that I was very optimistic as I would have moved to a city close to her city next year but what she told me crushed my optimism as our situation wouldn't change even if the distance seperating us would be significant smaller as long as she lives with her parents. She doesn't plan to move out for at least 2 years but probably longer. She told me her parents would maybe accept me if I would bend over backwards for her parents. Of course I told her that I won't do that and that I can't keep up our relationship under this conditions.

We really miss eachother and it crushes me seeing her sad and hurt like this. But I'm also disappointed and angry that she doesn't stand up to her parents for our relationship and just let it tear it apart by them. I don't know if I did the right thing as I miss her so much. And I don't know what I should do: should I just let it be or should I give her time to think about her situation? I really don't have any hope left. 

TL;DR GF moves back in with her parents, her parents aren't accepting me and thus we can't see each other. I broke up."

"Me [M16] crush on [F17] Don't know what to do, help!


This is my first Reddit post, and I'm posting this on mobile, so the formatting might be really messy.

English also isn't my first language, so this might be really long and expect a lot of spelling mistakes. I'll include a TL;DR at the bottom

So basically, we're both boarding students from who originate from the same city. I haven't known her before I came, she has been here a year longer than me. We've known each other for 10 months, and have only started talking for 4 months.

She's really smart and beautiful, we've been playful with each other for awhile, I mostly started talking to her   mostly because I needed help with my homework, since at the time I didn't know I liked her.

She kinda reminds me of the people I met at home, being around her makes me feel at ease, and I don't feel as homesick as normal. I also feel like I can trust her more, as we both speak our native language. 2 of her friends have told me that she likes me, however I doubt kinda doubt that, my self esteem is pretty low and the thought of someone having a crush on me seems
unrealistic.

That being said I'm also a bit dense, she may have shown signs that likes me back that I have overlooked

The thing is, I have only recently gotten over my last crush who lives in my hometown who I've known for 5 years. I've also never been in or considered being in relationship before, even though I've had crushes way more intense than this, I just didn't see the need to. 

I think I'm threatened by the fact that she has been in 2 relationships, I'm scared that I might not be as good as them for her, this combined with the fact that I have no idea in what people do in relationships. This is also a crucial time for us, external exams are coming in May which will affect our chances in getting into universities.

I like her a lot, but I don't want to hurt her, both emotionally and academically. I have no idea what to do



TL;DR: There's this girl at my boarding school that I like a lot, we come from the same city. Friends of hers said that she likes me, but now is a very important time for us academically. I have low self esteem and no dating experience so I have no idea what to do.

"How to I [23M] stop coming across as clingy and needy?


Whenever I started to like a woman that I have just met or a new female friend that I have real connection with, I feel like I started on becoming clingy with them. Its like I just want to be around whether talking to them in person or in chat

I have a new female friend and we have been friends for 5 months. Right now, I feel like whenever she did not reply to my last chat message, I am getting impatient and anxious. I feel anxious because I felt like she does not want to talk to me or a fear that I might lose her as a friend. 

I really don't have alot of female friends and that is why probably I feel the anxiety of it. I know I should not feel this way but I just can't help it and I feel guilty about this.

Any advice on how to not come across as clingy and needy?

"I [28F] have 2 dogs that my husband [30M] refuses to be involved with


I have two large dogs that I've had since before I met my husband. He has known about the dogs since the day we met, and they've always lived with me. We've been married about 1.5 years now and are living together. My husband never had pets before and is not used to having dogs that are like family. One of my dogs was nervous around my husband when they first met, and it's taken some time and gentle interaction to get them used to each other.

My husband also pushed to get my younger dog in to training classes, which I was happy to do. He promised to start participating in training classes once the dog got to more advanced levels, which I think is important for him to know how to interact with the dogs and have realistic expectations. The dog is now at advanced levels of training, but my husband is saying he wants nothing to do with the dogs from now on.

He's not asking for me to get rid of the dogs, but I don't know how living together and having a life together can happen if he is going to pretend my dogs don't exist. I've tried to explain to him why it's so important to me but he won't hear me out. He doesn't dislike dogs in general, and there are no health or safety concerns. I really don't know what to do here.

TL;DR husband lives with me but doesn't want to interact with my dogs in any way"
"I [17M] want to ask my friend [17F] out but idk if she is over her ex [17M] because the broke up because he is not coming back to my city for a while


So I want to ask this girl out but she has a weird relationship with her ex because he went to Germany as an exchange student but he is not coming back to my city for university and they broke up before then they came back then they broke up again 


She says she is single but I’m not sure she is ready for me to ask her out, she has said multiple times (after she broke up with her boyfriend) that she liked me before she was with her ex boyfriend so I have that going for me but the semester ends in 2 days so I have to make a move fast because I want to ask her out in person, what should I do?

I’m trying to be more with her but idk if she only wants me as a friend or if she is open to another relationship

Ask me if you have any questions about the situation

TLDR: Idk if she is ready for me to ask her out because she broke up with her boyfriend because he is not coming back anytime soon"
"I feel bad for wanting my boyfriend to regret not being as open with me. It is terrible but I want him to realize how great Of a time we had and I hoped he would like you know, be more into the relationship instead of being detached (which I feel Shitty for because this may just be his depression)?


He is a 29/M and I’m a 25/F. 

I left because I could just tell he wasn’t crazy for me after three months. He didn’t seem excited by me. He didn’t see me interested much actually. I would tell him about my life and he didn’t seem excited and I thought I did cool stuff. He was pretty distant emotionally but I could tell he would just go through the motions and I had to ask him to do basic relationship stuff. Plus lots of the time he wouldn’t thank me for doing nice stuff. He asked me out after three weeks so I thought he was really into me. 

So, I left him. He said he wasn’t head over heels for me at all and that I grew on him and that he believed he would never fall head over heels at this stage in his life. I told him he should be with someone who he is crazy about. Someone who makes him happy and who he can’t wait to be around, not someone who he hangs out with to prevent from getting in trouble so he can continue to fuck. 

I feel Shitty for this. Thinking maybe it would have been better if I gave it more time but honestly I feel like I don’t want to waste my time. If you commit to someone then you really commit and try hard work them and if it doesn’t work at least you can say you tried your best. He on the other hand wanted to take it super slow. Yet, he asked me to be his gf three weeks after dating so I assumed he was really into me. Maybe it was because I was going to be out of town for a long time and he didn’t want me leaving him for anyone, which is honestly Shitty. He didn’t seem interested in my trip at all when I was gone and would regularly ignore me or give me one worded responses. 

He wasn’t mad when we broke up. He really wanted to stay friends and mentioned the sex was Great. I’m assuming he wanted a fwb and wanted to lock me down by making me his gf right before I left on vacation for two weeks. He just never seemed into ME.  I think he just liked how I made him feel. 

I thought I deserved better so I left. I guess I am slightly an asshole for wishing he would realize how well I treated him and how much of a good time we had together and regret not opening himself up to me and truly giving me a shot. I think he isn’t over his ex and that I’m just a bad person. 

**TLDR: left bf of three months Bc he wasn’t crazy for me. I low key am a bad and want him to regret not opening up more to me and for making us an official couple and he didn’t even have strong feelings for me. I had to just grow on him and he was more distant after we started dating than before**"
"Should I (20F) stay friends with this guy (22M) who makes me uncomfortable, but who says I'm one of the few good things in his life?


First of all, I'm not a native English speaker, so expect some gramatical errors. So, I've been studying with this guy at university (we major at the same subject) for almost two years and about six months ago we started to get closer, as friends. However, some time after that, he told me he was developing romantic feelings about me. At the beginning, I was OK with it (especially because I guessed he didn't have any real control over his feelings), even though I told him I wasn't into him and wanted to remain only a friend. He accepted it and we continued our friendship, but he would always confess to me, and say that he would ""win me over"", and at some point it really started to seem like he was obsessed about me in an almost creepy way, so I asked him some space. After that (like, immediatily after), he would barely show up to classes, for like months. A month or so ago, one of his friends told me he was suffering from some very bad health issues (the doctors haven't diagnosed yet what exactly he has). Some days after, he came to me asking for us to be close again and I accepted it, but, to be honest, I feel very uncomfortable in his presence now (and I don't even know why I feel this bad lol) and I just really wanna stay away from him. He continues to confess to me over and over again, just like before, though he had said he wouldn't do that anymore. So, the question is: should I keep up with this friendship to avoid hurting him, considering he's been going through some serious issues and he always says I'm one of the few good things in his life, or should I ask him to leave me alone? 

&amp;#x200B;

tl;dr: I was friends with a guy who fell in love with me and seemed obsessed about me, which made me very uncomfortable, so I asked for some space. Now, he's been going through some serious health issues and asked me to be friends again, but I still feel bad around him. Should I keep up with this friendship to avoid hurting him, or should I ask him to leave me alone? "
"My [25F]’s SO [34M] has strong opinions about my haircut. Is any of us making it a bigger deal than it really is?


A little back story. I’m on mobile so please forgive my format. 

So I will be spending thanksgiving with my SO’s family next week. We’ve been dating for a year now and I’ve met his parents and siblings a few times but next week will be the first time meeting his large extended family who will all be there. I know spending the holidays with your SO for the first time is a big deal for most people but even bigger deal for him because he hasn’t brought a girl to a family event in 3 years.

I have very long hair and I like changing my hairstyle every few years, though nothing drastic. One of the styles that I keep rotating to is thick straight bangs that go just below my eyebrows. I’ve been thinking about getting my hair cut like that again recently but my SO asked me very seriously several times not to because that hairstyle makes me look “like a teenager” and worried about not making a good impression at thanksgiving. At first I thought he was joking but he seriously begged me to not, and that it was making him anxious and that if I must do it, could I wait until after thanksgiving and he will take me to the hair salon himself afterwards.

I thought he was making such a big deal out of a hair cut and without that good of a reason. I’ve been told by a lot of people that I look very young (even without bangs), but I feel pretty confident in making a “good first impression” because I know I am more than what age I look - I have a good job in a STEM field and have good manners and converse quite well with people in general. But I agreed to his request anyways because I remembered the first time he had to meet my parents and I was so nervous, and I helped him pick out his outfits etc. But besides that we are both pretty relaxed people, he has never made any requests or demands of the sort. Just this once.

But when I told this to my friends and my sister, they all independently told me that I am being a pushover and that he is patronizing me and he has no right to tell me how I style myself. And that this could be a gateway to controlling behavior. I don’t see it that way at all but I can’t help thinking about it now. 

So I would really appreciate some outside perspective. Are they right? Am I really a pushover? Or is this not a problem at all like I thought? How about his request itself? Is he making a bigger deal out of my hair than it really is?

Thanks for reading!

TLDR: my SO doesn’t want me to get my hair cut a certain way, I agreed, but other people seem to think that request was unreasonable? "

"I (27F) want to tell my parents (40sF, 50sM) that they've hurt my feelings but none of us are skilled in communicating


My family has historically struggled with emotional conversations. I love my parents and siblings to death (I'm oldest of three) and we have a wonderful relationship *until* it comes to talking about our feelings and/or serious topics. They've been incredible parents to me and I overall can't imagine being raised better--I think me and my siblings turned out great, if I may, and part of the reason I'm hesitant to have kids is that I'd want the relationship with my kids to be the same as the relationship I have with my parents and I'm fearful that I won't achieve that. My family is hands down my favorite and most important priority and spending time with them is my literal favorite thing to do. 

But, like I said, communication is not a strong suit of my parents (and thus now us kids). To sum it up best, when my parents divorced, they did not tell us for **seven months** because they couldn't figure out how. My siblings and I could feel that something was off, so my younger brother called a family meeting and asked wtf was going on, and *that's* when we found out. It's fucked up for sure, but honestly despite this my parents have been great: they are kind, fun, trusting, helpful, etc. They just...can't talk about real shit. Growing up I never really learned how to communicate effectively because I never saw it; I'm definitely much better than I used to be, but it has taken a tonnn of work and I still have a ways to go. 

Lately it's been weighing heavy on me some things my parents have unintentionally done. I want to make them aware of it partly for my own closure but I also want to ensure that my youngest sibling (16m) doesn't experience some of the same missteps. There are three main things I want to communicate to them but I'm very nervous and anxious about it because I don't really know how to be vulnerable.

For starters, one of the biggest things that has hurt me in my life is that they didn't/don't support my passions and talents like my younger brother's (21m). He's incredibly talented athletically, so he's always been in sports and receiving trophies, awards, acknowledgements, etc. He's on his college team and they're very successful, so he gets a lot of notice outside our family too. My talents are more intellectually driven: I'm a great writer, did well academically, and a talented presenter. My parents struggled to highlight my achievements growing up; it was very easy to display a trophy, less easy to display praise from my teachers and mentors. They never made me feel bad about my achievements and always congratulated me, made sure to tell me they too thought I was talented and read all my poems and essays, but somehow it would never come up when they were talking to friends and family about what us kids were up to. This came to a head in college when I had 5 major events to show off my talents: 3 poetry readings and 2 award ceremonies over the four years. My parents didn't attend any. I figured it was due to distance (my college is 30 min away) though it still hurt a bit until my brother went to college 2 hours away. They go to each one of his games, even in the first year when it was a well-known fact that he would not play. I hate to admit it, but I've started to resent them for it. I brought it up to them once a year or two ago but I still don't feel any better and I feel like I want them to know that I probably never will. However, I don't want to just make them feel shitty, so I don't know if it's worth it. At the same time, my youngest brother is struggling academically *and* athletically due to serious injury, so I'm worried he's not being properly supported and encouraged. I would hate for him to feel as invisible as I often felt, and if my parents didn't know what to do with my talents, they definitely don't know what to do with his.

Secondly, lately I feel like they only reach out to me when they need something. Two weeks ago my mom texted me asking what I was doing the following evening. I had had a stressful week at work and planned an entire day in with my boyfriend: ordering pizza, playing video games, jammies all day, the whole shebang. I told her this, and she asked me to drive 2 hours round trip to pick up my younger brother (the athlete) so he could visit for the weekend and then take her car back to school. There was no one else available, so I begrudgingly did it, but didn't stay for dinner as requested bc I felt disrespected. I know my plans were super lazy but this has also been a trend across my life; to drop whatever I'm doing to help out the fam. I don't mind it in the long run, but sometimes I want to ask what they'd do if I didn't live 30 min away. Last weekend they asked me to go with them to watch my brother's game, which I couldn't do because of work, so they then asked me to dog sit for them. I actually got the feeling they were glad I couldn't go so that I could save them some money by watching the dogs for free. They also asked me to watch the dogs at my grandma's so I could house sit for her at the same time. My grandma lives in the middle of nowhere in a huge house, which has always stressed me out due to a lot of anxiety about intruders and the dark. I agreed, since I knew they needed me, but I had a horrible time. They did apologize saying they didn't realize it would suck so much, but they also made jokes at my expense about it, so it was hard to feel better.

Finally, my birthday is next week and I want to bring up how last year was my worst birthday ever. My bday is always around Thanksgiving and last year my brother (again, the athlete) was home. A couple days before, the day before, and the day of I told my family the only thing I wanted was to get korean bbq with them, esp since my bf was OOT with his family. My brother was heading back to school on my birthday, but he needed transportation because he car had broken down. The first half of the day was about figuring out how to get him back to school, as well as everyone trying to make sure they got to see him before he went. We had a pseudo-celebration for me at lunch with food from one of my favorite restaurants, but again, most of the focus was on my brother and also not what I asked for. In the evening I waited and waited for my mom to be ready to go (since dad was taking my brother) until dinner time came and went. I got up to take myself to a bar to wallow (lol) which is when my mom realized what time it was. I know I should have said something sooner, but I selfishly felt like I shouldn't need to. We ended up getting chinese food since it was so late, I had to drive, and I also had to stop at a store to get my youngest brother supplies for a project he forgot about. I really, really don't want a repeat of this and I feel like they need to know how much last year hurt my feelings. I don't think they even realized.

I know I'm painting an incomplete picture here so I want to stress that I do love them very much and they are wonderful parents, but they are also humans who make human mistakes. They have done so much for me over my lifetime and sacrificed so much for me and my brothers, so I want to make sure that I am not going into this attacking and/or just making them feel bad for no reason. I also want to be clear that I don't resent my brother for his success since I'm realizing a lot of what I want to bring up involves him too--he's hands down the best person I know, so selfless and mature, and none of what I mentioned is his fault so I have zero reason to bring him into the conversation.

&amp;#x200B;

Any advice over how I can communicate with my parents is hugely appreciated. I don't know how to bring it up to them or navigate the conversation, and since they obviously aren't very skilled in this either, I'm wondering how I can manage the conversation effectively. Thanks so much everyone &lt;3

**TL;DR: my family has hurt my feelings a few times and I want to tell them, partly for my own closure but also to ensure my youngest brother doesn't have the same experience, but we don't talk about serious things or emotions so I have no idea how to communicate this to them.**"
"My husband (23m) and I (23f) asked his step mom what to get his dad for his birthday. She responded with something we can afford, but is over our budget.


My husband and I are in California because I’m an egg donor and have a cycle out here. We were supposed to be home in time for his dads birthday on Tuesday, but my retrieval was pushed back so now we’re not flying out til Wednesday. We decided to just fly straight to my sister’s home (in another state) for thanksgiving and hitch a ride back with my parents to our home state next Sunday. So we will not see his dad at all for his birthday. 

His dad always makes small comments about us not spending enough time with him. We spend more time with him than anyone else as he lives 10 minutes from us. We go over there weekly, which is more than I’d like to, and have them over occasionally as well. My husband gets guilted into this all the time. Divorced parents constantly trying to win the fight for his time... so he feels pretty bad about missing the birthday. 

So we’re looking for something on amazon to buy him for his birthday, something under $20 as Christmas is coming up, and we never spend money on parental birthday gifts because we’re 23 and both of our parents are well off. It’s more of a nice gesture since we’re less financially stable than they are. We couldn’t find anything on amazon so we asked husbands step mom for advice. She finally got back to us today with the “PERFECT GIFT idea!!!!” Well it’s an $80 gift. They know I’m getting compensated for this egg donation but we’re using that money to pay off my remaining student loans and pay for my masters program. I would love to get him an $80 gift for Christmas but we can’t do both. Yes we can afford it. We have a ton of money saved as we’re trying to buy a house. It’s just the principle of the thing that we don’t really buy our parents birthday gifts. We spend time with them and do a nice gesture. 

Do we need to explain this to step mom? Should we just say “thanks for the idea, we may save that for Christmas” and try to explain we didn’t have a big budget for birthday gifts? Is our budget any of their business? Just trying to get ideas of the best way to respond to step mom. 

This is what her text said to get an idea of her excitement... “I got it!!!! Your dad would actually like a (gift). I just ordered one for (stepsister) for Christmas.  They're on sale right now for 79.00.  They have different shipping methods.  The one I ordered for (stepsister) is standard shipping and coming in 3 to 6 days.  I think it would be a good gift for your dad.“ 

TLDR: step mother in law gave a birthday gift idea for my father in law. We can afford it but it’s out of our budget for birthday gifts. What’s the appropriate way to respond? "
"Am I [24m] being too harsh on my SO [20f] when I get offended by some of the jokes she makes about me?


\*Throwaway account because I don't want this to be traced back to me.\*

So I've dated her for a bit over half a year now and we get along well, but a theme that's been repeating in our relationship is that she would make jokes about me in a way I don't really like. I've been bullied a lot and still deal with the issues said bullying have inflicted upon me, and while I'm making a lot of progress, I still get offended easily, especially when it's coming from someone I love and cosidering that I would never make the same jokes about a SO.

 Said jokes revolve around my appearance amongst other things. I’m young but my hair genetics are fucked up: I’m on my way to be bald and I have grey hairs everywhere. I also have a bit of a belly. She’s made fun of these things on multiple occasions, calling me an old man and such, and I’ve repeatedly told her, implicitly and explicitly, that I don’t like nor appreciate it. On an other occasion, she made fun of my reading comprehension score on a college admission exam (think SAT’s). My score was a bit above average, mind you. It’s only that hers was higher. When we first dated, she said that I was a 6/10 looks-wise, and she wasn’t joking. Although she took it back later when I told her that I didn’t appreciate it, I still think about it when she hurls yet another thoughtless joke at me, and it makes me feel like I’m dating someone with abusive tendencies without realising it. 

What makes me ask is two things: she’s actually very good and loving most of the time. The occasions during which she she has made these remarks can be counted on two hands, and for her, it’s just banter. I also have a tendency to take offence to things that she does/says that I later realise weren’t malicious. Because of my history with bullying and other family issues, I have trouble trusting others, and it has surfaced many times during our relationship. 

I don’t know what to make of this situation, because I know deep down that she doesn't actually mean to be harmful. I also fear that my overt sensitivty otherwise, combined with a demand to not make fun of me in any way could push her away. It maybe is better to take her jokes for what they are and not fixate myself on them.

On the other hand, I'd never make fun of her like that. I know her insecurities and I know better than to poke at them, because it's not kind. There's a lot of ways to tease one another that don't involve bringing up the other's weaknesses. Besides, I don't really think that jokes like this should exist in a relationship. It's not who I am to banter like that with my partner. With a friend? Sure. But my girlfriend?

At this point, I don't even take offence anymore. I just doubt whether this person actually listens to me when I speak up against a behaviour I don't like. When I had brought this up in the past, she understood and apologised - only for her to do the same thing again on an other occasion.

\*TL;DR: girlfriend has somewhat of a habit of poking at my insecurities, and when I speak up about it, she acknowledges that she fucked up, but she repeats the mistake again and again. What to do?\*

"Girl [23] in my master's program blocked me[23] on fb while I was away on co-op. We'll see each other daily soon. What do I do?


I know this is going to sound like petty drama, but I'm really confused.

My master's program is two years and in the middle, we have the option to work for 8 months, which I chose to do.

Today i discovered that girl from my program blocked me on fb out of the blue while I've been working.

I find the block a bit dramatic. If she didn't want to see my stuff, she could've unfollowed me. If she didn't want me to see her stuff, she could've deleted me. It's an odd decision in a tiny faculty where you have all your classes together.  We will have to see each other every day for four months. I'm not usually the one who initiates conversation, so it's not like she's blocking me for what I've been saying.

I don't know why she blocked me at all. I'm completely confused, My guess is that she perceived our friendship to be closer than it is, and she's mad at me for not talking to her more often. When we met up in the summer, she'd always tell me the precise amount of it had been since we'd met up. But I hadn't even noticed - working full time, days blurred together, and i have close friends I see less often. Since the fall term, our conversations this term have been civil and brief. There is no one else I hang out with in my program, either, other than to go to occasional socials. Working is exhausting and I have long commutes. I only work and sleep and do my assignments for the two classes I'm taking. I have no energy or spare time and I generally spend my free time going on walks or trying to relax. I don't know what I did wrong.

When we did hang out, I did get the sense she was dramatic. She used to tell me about blocking other people and getting in fights with friends. My friends are not dramatic at all; we just do things like try new restaurants together, catch up about work and life and whatever. I'm not really used to this behaviour. I guess I did try to distance myself from her a bit more, and maybe that's what she's sensed, but at the same time, I really am not connected to anyone else in my program. ""Distancing myself"" just meant interacting with her at the same frequency as other people in my cohort.

I feel uncomfortable that this girl obviously has beef with me and that she's taking classes right now the rest of my faculty while I'm away working. I'm scared she's been talking about me. I really don't know how I'm going to see someone daily in a few months who is obviously mad at me. I made the mistake of opening up to her and saying I'm gay, which also scares me. I'm scared she's telling people - one time she hinted at spreading rumours about me being gay ""to help me get noticed because I'm so shy"".

I'm very private about my life, all I really talk about with my cohort is our classes and our industry. I'm a private person and when we chatted it felt like she was always trying to get more information from me than I wanted to share. Again, I'm super private with everyone else in the program so I'm wondering if she's angry I'm putting my usual wall back up with her when she thought it came down.

I did text her to ask if she blocked me, which she ignored. Perhaps it was a mistake, but at the same time, it's the only way I can find out what's going on, clearly I am analyzing and speculating a lot.

I don't know how to gracefully diffuse this situation when I go back to school. I will see her daily, and she'll have gotten closer to my cohort in the time I've been away. I already feel really isolated from them, and if she's been saying things about me I have no ability to defend, I have even less power.

I love my university, my faculty, and my cohort. I have not encountered a personality or situation like this and I'm confused. She could make my final term a living hell for me and I'm scared to go back. She could sabotage my shot in the industry by spreading rumours. She knows everyone in the program while I only know a few closely. I don't know what to do. I wish I could shake it off, but I'm not sure how.

&amp;#x200B;

\--------------

**TL;DR** Girl in my master's program blocked me while I've been away on a co op term. I have no idea why. We will be in the same classes next term and I'm nervous about going back to class."
"I (22f) feel hurt by my friend (21f) who often implies I've told her stuff in person when I have no recollection of saying it. Feeling like I want to let go of the relationship but I'm not sure how to proceed. Advice would be greatly appreciated.


 

Throwaway because this feels weirdly unique.

I've recently been hurt by a friend and am not sure what to do with the relationship from now on.

The backstory is I've been good friends with this girl for awhile but I began to doubt myself a bit when she would claim she told me stuff in person and I had no recollection of it. This would happen with small stuff so I just assumed I had forgotten due to being stressed or tired at the time.

Then it started happening with bigger stuff. We would arrange to meet somewhere and she would get upset that I forgot the time or venue when I had a completely different idea of what we were doing. Then she would arrange a get together for all our mutual friends that I didn't say I was going to and she would again get upset, claiming that I told her in person that I was going.

The last 2 times were events that were of much more importance. I arranged a birthday dinner for my partner's 25th at a restaurant. I rang the restaurant and they only had one time slot on the Sunday night, the week after his birthday. I grabbed that spot since they were booked out until 2 months after his birthday. I guess they had a cancellation so I sent out invites, made a fb event and got the ball rolling on planning this dinner.

The day of the dinner she starts spamming me on fb messenger and with texts, panicking that she can't make it anymore. I call her to let her know it's cool and she immediately bursts out with ""why did you tell me it was a lunch?!"".  
Wtf.  
I explained that it had never been a lunch, both the event and the invites clearly said dinner and the time of 7pm and besides, when the idea was first conceived I had always thought of doing a dinner. ""You told me in person it was a lunch!""  
I couldn't believe this and insisted that I would never say that, the plan had always been a dinner. She doubled down and claimed I had definitely said it was a lunch. I hung up on her but then spent the rest of the night upset and racking my brain if I actually did say it was lunch to her by mistake.

The most recent one was last week and it was her 21st. She had planned a few dinners and lunches for her birthday week and got upset with me for not spending 3 nights of her week with her out of town when I said I could only do two. She said that I definitely told her in person that I could do the 3. She called me some pretty nasty names, attacked my mental health and said I was an uncaring friend. By this point I'm beginning to question my memory until my partner said ""it's funny how you only have memory loss with this one person"". He also pointed out that there's never any proof in our messages of what she's saying we've talked about ""in person"".  
The ball dropped and now I feel hurt that she probably has manipulated me and made me question myself so much.

&amp;#x200B;

So now I don't know how to proceed with this friendship. I definitely want some space atm but don't know if I should say anything to her or just let her go. Any advice would be helpful.

&amp;#x200B;

TL:DR: My friend keeps on insisting that she has told me things/I've told her things that I have no memory of in person. There's no written evidence either. At first I thought it was me and that I was forgetting but after happening a few too many times and only with this particular person, I'm beginning to think it's her and not me. I'm now not sure if I want to continue the friendship and how to proceed."
"I just found out my [19M] ex-girlfriend [18F] is now dating the one guy I suspected of her cheating on me with and dont't know how to handle it.


So me and my ex broke up before we left for college in early July. We had been dating pretty much all of high school, 3 years. I have not seen her since we left for school and the only thing we have said to each other was her wishing me happy birthday and me thanking her. The relationship she has with the guy is that they were in the same math class and both would go to tutoring at some place off campus one day a week later at night. She would tell me who he was when I asked and said he had a girlfriend that lived in Italy. They became pretty good friends and she would give him rides home occasionally and one day I asked if they had ever hungout  outside of school she said no. And I'll bring up this later in the post.

Looking back after we broke up, me and my ex's relationship was definitely not a good one. Yes we had a lot of great moments but to me it felt draining after awhile. I became paranoid around her and lacked any type of confidence and lost my self-esteem when I was with her due to me asking her about the lack of affection she's been showing lately (affection was pretty rare as is) and her saying that she did not find me attractive anymore. Yeah I'm not kidding that's what happened. But dumb me was thinking I could fix this and I guess it got ""fixed"" and things went back to normal (still barely any affection).

So as to why I suspected her cheating was because she would rarely, if ever, let me go on her phone for any reason. And sometimes when she'd text she'd go out of her way to position herself in a manner that I couldn't see what was on her phone. One day when we took a day trip somewhere, I was being paranoid about the math guy. And yes I know what I'm about to say isn't healthy in a relationship and I should've broken up with her way sooner. But my plan was to change the music and ""look"" at what else we should play but instead I went to her text messages and saw she had been texting the guy in the past few days. The most recent text being her responding pretty early in the morning like around 4-5 and knowing her she sleeps in and would never wake up that early and probably wouldn't even text me back if I had text her that early. I look through the texts I see one that mentions meeting at Chiptole and remember she had said that they had never hungout outside of school. I have been on her phone for a little too long now so I decide to put it down after and try not to think much of the text and say that I probably misread it since I was reading through them fast.

Now as for the present. Two days ago I saw that she commented on that guys Instagram saying ""This is cute"" and last night I saw that he was commenting on her picture calling her ""a dream"" and her flirting back. So ever since I've been thinking that she definitely couldve been cheating on me but not completely sure. I've always said I wouldnt want to know if an ex cheated on me but now I'm in a middle ground of thinking she did but still not knowing for sure. Looking back at the signs today we're definitely signs that she was but I just overlooked them during my time with her. Since my self esteem drop I had thought she was looking for someone better all the time and was paranoid a lot during my time with her. I don't know how to handle these feelings right now and don't know what I should even be thinking cause all I feel right now is sad emptiness.

TL;DR Was suspicious of my ex-girlfriend cheating on me while in a relationship with her. Now is dating the only guy I have really suspected her to cheat on me with. Don't know how I can handle these feelings or what I can do to help myself."
"Boyfriend[17M]is still talking to ex[17F]after toxic 2 year relationship.


So my boyfriend has mentioned his ex several times(about every other time we hang out)saying how toxic their relationship was. They dated for 2 years and broke up about 2 months ago. He said she basically ruined his life by isolating him from his friends and being very needy. Knowing this I try to be really chill and give him space, but still being a good girlfriend at the same time. The other day we were making food together and his ex calls him. He automatically gets really uncomfortable and just says “why is she calling me”. She then asks him to hang out before this get together that a lot of our friends were going to but he declines saying he’s doing“something”. I found that kind of hurtful because if they were just friends why couldn’t he say he was with his girlfriend. After he hung up he asks me if I want to know what it was about and I just say it’s fine. Fast forward to the party, they both talk to each other. I’m terrible at confrontation so I can’t even look at them but I hear her talking about a dream he had last night. Which he told me about earlier in the day. At first I thought there wasn’t anything to worry about but the fact that she’s calling him to hang out makes it seem like they’ve hung out before and are still talking. Which is fine if they’re still friends but he’s constantly talking about how bad their relationship was so why would he still be taking to her? I know I should say something about it but I don’t want to seem controlling. What should I say? 

TLDR; boyfriends ex called him up asking to hang out even though he always mentions how bad their relationship was. "
"girlfriend's[22F] dad is giving her an ultimatum between me[21M] and him because of religion


This is a throwaway since I don't want my friends to see this right now. Me and my girlfriend have been dating for 2 years now, she is Christian I am Muslim although we are both not religious. Her dad found out about us dating almost 6 months ago and has been fighting with her since and threatening to kick her out of the house and disown her. We really love each other and our relationship has been going perfectly except for this.

Today her dad finally told her that he is done fighting and he is disowning her for good (and actually did). My girlfriend is very close to her family and was always friends with her dad, so seeing her dad acting this way is really hurting her and she doesn't want to lose her dad, but in the same time she doesn't want to lose me. She hasn't been able to do anything and has just been having break downs, and I feel like I am the one who would have to end the relationship for her good.. This would really hurt me because I am deeply in love with her and we were in a very serious relationship. However, I always want what's good for her but I know I can't decide that.

I tried asking to talk to her dad and letting him get to know me, so that he sees I am clearly different than what he thinks I am. But he told her he doesn't want to see me and he doesn't care if I am made of gold, what he cares about is that I am muslim and they come from a very christian country (Eastern Europe) and that it's against his traditions, family and religion. He even told her he would rather her date literally any christian even if he is homeless over me and that there is a 0% chance he will ever approve of this. I am not sure what I should do for the past couple months I have been just supporting her and giving her hope, but after what happened today it's clear that he will never change his opinion. I am asking for advice about what I should do? We really don't want to leave each other and I know that she won't be able to break up with me, so I am the one who would have to do it. Please give me advice about how I should deal with this and if there is anything I can do to help her or advice to give her?

Sorry for the grammatical mistakes, English is not my first language.

tldr; fuck religion"
"I (m27) recently got a really good new job which means I have to move an hour away. My gf (f27) is behaving selfishly and upset and making me feel upset about my decision. Am I the one in the wrong?


I am an english teacher in china ( from the uk). Me and my gf have been dating since may and our relationship has go official and much more serious since September. 

I have accepted a new job on the edge of our city and is about 1 hour from where she currently lives. Atm we work together and live and 10 mins walk apart. She is usually very supportive of my hobbies etc

I had 2 job offers. About the same money. 
One was close (about 10 mins travel) from where we live now. And the other one was about an hour maybe more by bus or subway. 

The job I have chosen is an all round better school, slightly more money, less teaching hours, better facilities, better staff etc. But the location is poor (probably the reason for the higher salary)

I have been deciding between the two jobs. If it wasn't for her it would have been a no brainer. But we are early in our relationship, I really love her she's great, so I was worried. 
I have been leaning to the better school but was finalising details and wasn't sure.

I personally believe we can survive the distance. It isn't a different country or even city. 

This morning I got an email outlining all the terms of the new job and it's just way better. So I said. ""I'm going to get the far away job""

She got really upset and I knew she would be but she was acting really sad and pissed off and getting angry about it.

I tried to acknowledge this and talk to her and reassure her. But she was blaming me and get upset and I kinda felt like she was ruining what should have been a happy and exciting occasion and just making me feel shit about it.

Am I the bad guy for being annoyed? I tried to reassure her but she just made me feel like shit. So I told her she was ruining an exciting occasion and being a bit selfish. Coz that's how she was making.me feel. I'm also worried that she thinks a one hour travel is the end of the world.

It was also a hard decision
 I didn't take this decision lightly. And now I feel like shit for making that decision. I believe it's the beat for our relationship. And I have said this

Anyway she is still pisses at me and I want to know if I'm the bad guy or is this perceived selfishness a major red flag?

**TLDR:** I accepted a new job meaning I will have to move an hour away. Gf is super upset about it and I think she should do more to hide that and just try to be excited with me"
"I [M25] might have to end my friendship with my best friend/ex-girlfriend [F25] and I'm scared as hell.


Backstory:

Met this girl months and months ago and we hit it off so well. After three dates, it was clear we were getting exclusive, and we were so happy around one another. We weren't just enamored with each other, but we were really good friends. However, throughout the course of our dating, things would \*always\* come up on her end. We had almost as many canceled dates as actual dates. Very often, the reasons for cancellation were quite serious: in one case, she had to fly out of state to see her uncle in the hospital; in another case, her dog died; in another case, she was suddenly overcome with panic attacks. Nonetheless, I fell in love with her, and she told me she loved me, too. We both struggle(d) with our mental health as we both have severe anxiety and severe depression. However, our coping mechanisms were always wildly different; while I would reach out for help, she would completely withdraw. This came to a head a few months ago when (again) something awful happened to a member of her close family. However, this didn't just result in her canceling our date--she broke up with me in a text message and cut off all contact. I was lost and shattered and confused.

Five weeks later, she reaches out to me again. I experience every worldly emotion during this phone call: ecstasy, joy, anger, grief. We talk on the phone for three hours and I finally get answers--she cut me out because she felt she needed to focus solely on her family member and that she couldn't do that in a relationship (and I was going through a lot mentally, so it wasn't exactly always a walk in the park with me). We talked about everything. We talked about how much she hurt me, we talked about how much we enjoyed each other's company. We settled on staying close friends, and, although she considers things to be over between us, she also stated that when she's ready to start dating again, we could go on one more date to see if things could work out between us.

Since that phone call, we've been decently solid friends. Texting back and forth, the occasional long phone call. We saw each other a few weeks ago and had an amazing time. We ended with a hug and I told her that she was one of my best friends. She told me I was one of hers. My depression got the best of me a few weeks ago and I reached out to her, but to no avail. Since then, things have been really strange. There was a period of two weeks (these last two weeks) where I got \*maybe\* two messages from her, and we were supposed to see each other during this time. She updated me saying that she was MIA because a family friend died and they were taking care of funeral arrangements. I give her my condolences, ask how she's doing (no response), and don't even bring up our plans because I know they're canceled. But around two weeks ago, I also noticed that she had blocked me from viewing her Instagram stories (you can block someone from seeing your story without blocking their account). She doesn't reach out to me anymore. So I told her ""we need to talk"" and we have a phone call set up for next week.

Ultimately, I think I might need to end this friendship. It's becoming entirely one-sided. She's acting shady and I don't know how much I trust her, because I often catch her in small, insignificant lies. I can't explain her behavior, especially the wide gap between what she says (""you're one of my best friends"") and what she does (hides her IG story from me). But I'm really afraid to talk to her about this. I'm afraid of sounding accusatory when I bring up the Instagram thing or the lying thing. I'm afraid of sounding insensitive when I bring up the ""you never talk to me"" thing. I'm mostly afraid she'll cut me out of her life again at the drop of a hat like she did last time, and it was really, really, really traumatizing to me the first time she did it (to the point where I fundamentally trust people less than I used to). But I do love her and I don't want to lose her friendship. I just really need guidance and would prefer it from an objective source, because she is NOT in my friends' good graces so they are pretty harsh when it comes to her.

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR: My ex-girlfriend/one of my best friends is acting strangely lately and I'm really afraid to confront her about it."
"I (F22) and my bf (M27) 3rd Anniversary failed. What should I do?


We have been together for 3 years. It's our anniversary today and I he stayed at mine last night and I had a 2 hr class today . I thought I would come back for him to be fully ready, smelling nice and brushed his teeth. But no I came back and he was in bed in PJs watching YouTube on his phone he didn't even brush his freaking teeth. I'm disgusted by his. Behaviour. He makes barely any effort on our relationship including special occasions. I make a effort for him. But now I just said cancel the place you are going to take me to. Should I stay or dump him? Its 3 yrs today and now making shitty excuses to why he wasn't ready.

"I (22m) am visiting my mom (55f) for Thanksgiving, and the house smells so bad I can't sleep. I think she might be a hoarder, and I don't know what to do. How can I help?


First off, I know no one on the internet can diagnose her with something as serious as hoarding disorder. But I am extremely worried about her, and looking back on my life it seems like she has some hoarding tendencies. I have diagnosed OCD (I'm on meds and have gone to therapy, and I think I'm about 99% in remission), and I've heard that there can be a link to hoarding. Whether she has it or not, the house is truly in a disgusting state.

I'm 22 and a senior in college, and I'm back this week for Thanksgiving to see my family. I just want to make it clear from the start that I'm not judging her because it seems like this is out of her control, and I'm worried about her since I live across the country now.

The moment I walked in last night, I felt like I was assaulted with the overwhelming scent of cat pee. It truly reeks in here and there are clumps of poo that haven't been cleaned, and I can't sleep at the moment. There are also just piles and piles of clothes and trash all over the house, with dirty and molded dishes in the sink and piles of papers, clothes, and trash strewn about. We downsized to a smaller house a few years ago and weren't able to bring most of our stuff (I'll explain below), but since then she's been collecting more and more junk.

I brought it up because I was concerned, and she looked genuinely pained and told me that it wasn't that dirty and that she didn't smell it but that she had been e so extremely busy lately so the house had gotten pretty bad. I've only been here for maybe a cumulative two and a half weeks this year (we have a bit of a troubled relationship on top of it), and this is by far the worst it's been since I was a kid.

The fact is that I know she is very busy. She's a very anxious person, and her department at work is under the gun at the moment so she's working a lot of extra hours. But I feel like the situation in the house goes beyond that.

When I was a kid, our house was truly a junkyard. Old furniture that she kept just in case, literal mountains of trash, a bathroom that we didn't use because there was an actual pile of shit in the toilet that couldn't be cleaned, rotten food, piles upon piles of boxes and books, dog shit all over the floor, old TVs, bikes, you name it (including a stray cat at one point). I kept my room very clean because the rest of the house was so dysfunctionally dirty, but when I stepped out of my room I would have to step over piles of things to get to the stairs. It got so bad that I was afraid to invite friends over, and I would avoid spending time in the house as much as possible.

Things changed a bit after a particularly traumatic summer when we ended up homeless after our dad abandoned us, and we ended up driving around the South while my mom looked for a place to resettle. We couldn't take hardly anything with us, and our landlord was horrified by what he saw when we went to clean the house out. It was truly disgusting.

But now I feel like it's getting back to that level, and I don't really know what I can do. I go to school on the other side of the country, and I was just offered a job after graduation to stay in the area so I don't see myself going back any time soon. My youngest brother still lives with my mom, but he deals with the mess by being gone the vast majority of the day and going straight to his room to sleep.

Is there anything I can do? How can I help her?

**TLDR: My mom's house is really disgusting, and I'm worried about her. How can I help?**"
"My [20m] girlfriend [24f] got mad and offended when I suggested therapy.


My girlfriend of almost 5 months has some depressive symptoms. She will often times tell me ""I am a failure"" and once she even told me ""sometimes I wish I wasn't alive"".

Earlier tonight she was having an exacerbation of her undiagnosed depression and the conversation went like this:

Me: Please don't take this the wrong way. But I think a form of therapy may help in some ways.
Her: So you think i'm a psycho.
Me: Do not think therapy is for ""crazy"" people. It may help.
Her: I'm offended. You're the first person to ever tell me that. If you think I'm not healthy for you, just leave me. I don't think I want to see you friday. 

As you can see she told me she wants to cancel our date friday. I feel so lost. It's so hard to help someone who does not want help. 
Any advice :/

TLDR: My [20m] girlfriend [24f] got mad and offended when I suggested therapy."
"My girlfriend(23) and I(22m) got in a massive fight last night. We've been together a year and few months.


Last night my girlfriend picked me from work and started insincerely complaining about how awkward it was when she was at the store because she was wearing a sweatshirt without a bra and people seeing her hard nipples in such a way that made it seem like she liked the attention she gets from it. Fast forward to an hour later we decide that we wanna go to Denny's to drink water and eat after we both had long days. As we walk in the host is fucking weird and is not inviting at all and the cook in the back is making cat calls at my girlfriend. As we prepare the table to sit on, the cook stares at both of us(looks at my girlfriend with great attention and looks me in the eyes a couple times) and keeps making ""howling"" and cat calling noises and smirking as they keep looking back at us. I tell my girlfriend that about it and about the fact I don't trust them and that we can just go somewhere else to eat and drink water. She doesn't listen to me when I tell her that I wanna leave because of that. She persists that we stay and continues to sit in the booth, so I just said ""fuck it"" and made my way out to call an Uber home. As I walked out the same cook was walking back to the kitchen staring at us, so I flip him off and exit the restaurant. My girlfriend runs to me and tells me what's wrong with me and that it's not her fault that people check her out and that she did nothing wrong. I tell her that she didn't respect me when I wanted to leave cause they were doing that shit to us. She continued to try and justify herself for wanting to stay at the Denny's and justifying the catcalling, to which I reply ""Just shut up and take me home"". I then rush into my house and lock the gate and she starts texting me asking why am I mad and that it's not her fault for the guys cat calling her but I continue to make it clear I was mad cause I was uncomfortable and she didn't respect my want to leave the Denny's. The fight was consisted of cursing and calling her name's, her defending herself about the situation, me telling her that she's loves when guys cat call her and then ending with me saying ""fuck you and goodnight"". My main problem with her is that she didn't own up to her part of the situation and kept trying to justify herself while not seeing that I was uncomfortable and wanted to leave. We have been together for a year and couple of months and I decided in my head that I don't wanna be with someone who feeds off of sexual attention from other people and doesn't own up to their mistakes and that I'm gonna break up with her the next morning, because I don't wanna subject myself to of being with someone like her who I feel emotionally abuses, manipulate and triangulates me. Am I justified for my action and feelings? Or am overreacting and making everything a big deal?. 

Tldr; Girlfriend gets cat called and doesn't wanna leave. Loves the attention. I wanna break up with her because of it."
"I [19F] feel like my parents [40sF/50sM] treat me and my sister [9] differently from our other sister [12]


I’m mentally disabled for lack of a better phrase. I have schizoaffective bipolar (schizophrenia+bipolar) and complex PTSD. Sometimes I go through really tough times, my mom is always there for me. My dad is always supporting me in what I choose to do. For example, I wanted to take ice skating classes last year and he generously offered to pay for them. 

Due to my illness I can end up in the hospital a lot and my mom is always asking how I’m doing, if I want to go get food or the store, she has a lot of patience and never yells or scolds me. She also spends a lot of time with me, especially when I was younger and couldn’t be left unsupervised.

My sister A is 9. There is obviously something very wrong mentally with her and my parents are trying to find a therapist. She is the baby of the family. And basically gets everything she wants. I wouldn’t say she’s a brat, just very sensitive. She has a hard time making friends and when my mom heard about this she immediately went to talk to the school. Both my parents hold long conversations with her, help her with homework, my dad spends hours helping her build legos.

Now, M is 12. She was having trouble with school and my mom...didn’t do much. She made one call to the teacher and that’s it. My parents never ask M about school or her friends. M is overweight. So, they’re always on her about her eating habits. Like, me and A  get some food and my dad tells M to stop eating so much, in a rude way. I’m honestly afraid she’s going to develop an eating disorder. I don’t think I’ve ever seen my parents help her with homework or invite her friends over or tell her good job (she has all A’s). 

I don’t want M to feel left out. But I don’t know how. I love both my sisters a lot and I can’t help notice how differently my parents treat me and A because of our mental health. When I was around M’s age was when my depression was really kicking in. I don’t want that for my sister.

***TLDR; Parents are more involved in mine [19F] and sister’s [9] lives due to our poor mental health and are barely involved in our other sister’s [12] life. They give me and my 9 yr old sister more attention than my 12 yr old sister. I want to help my 12 yr old sister so she doesn’t feel left out.***"
"I [M23] think my girlfriend [F22] is talking to another guy, but I'm not sure and I don't want to throw away everything if I break up with her.


So, my girlfriend \[F22\] and I \[M23\] have been dating for almost two years now, we have had our ups and downs as most couples do but I'm very happy with her and I love her a lot, we met at college and we are planning to get engaged in January or some time around there. There's a lot of reasons to get engaged and married soon but doesn't really matter here. 

&amp;#x200B;

So this started maybe 2 months back, not sure, we were out at a club with friends and we usually don't hang around each other super tight all night, which is fine. She was talking to some guy for a little bit but nothing major, we left and then later she told me they had been texting a little bit. He apparently ""fell in love"" immediately but was sad because she was dating someone (me) but she told him that they could still be friends. I thought it was a bit odd that they would keep talking but not a huge deal. 

Later I noticed that they were still texting and it seemed like she was hiding her phone from me. So one time when she left her phone near me I checked the messages (even though I know that's messed up), they were talking pretty normal but she kept calling him pet names which has been an issue with us in the past. She has called other guys pet names before and she says she has always done that, not in  a flirting way though (I guess). I confronted her about it and she was hurt that I looked through her phone but she understood the issue with the pet names and she said she would stop. 

I was still a bit annoyed with this whole situation and one night when I was bored and alone I texted a girl (something along the lines of ""Hi, how are you doing?"") I met online but never actually hung out with. She replied back and I realized I  was being dumb and didn't send anything else.

My gf found this and was hurt and sad because she has had past boyfriends cheat on her. She wasn't sure if she could stay together and I had to leave for the weekend on a business trip I couldn't cancel. When I got back we met up and talked and she said that we shouldn't break up but that we should keep some space between us to figure things out. We texted a bit less for that week and then the next weekend we met up to hang like we usually do on the weekends. I got this really intense gut feeling on the way home that something was up and again when she wasn't there I checked her phone. She had been sending nudes and stuff to the other guy and they were talking even more. I once again very mad and hurt and I confronted her about it and she said that we were on a break but I'm not so sure that I agreed on that type of break. She saw how I hurt I was and said she would stop talking to him.

After some time I decided to keep the relationship going. Nothing happened for a bit and then when she was showing me something on her phone she got text from him. I told her to show me what it said but she wouldn't and got scared because in her past other boyfriends have forced to do that or something. She said they haven't been talking and it was just bad timing that he texted her that time. I moved on and things were getting better for a while.

Then later a similar thing happened when we were going to a concert together. She was showing me something on her phone again and another text showed up. She said that he had ask for advice on his mom because she had some decease and my gf is a med student. She said she was going to tell me that he texted after the concert because she knew it would ruin our night if she told me before the concert. Again, I moved on and nothing more happened, things were getting better. 

&amp;#x200B;

And then suddenly one of my friends that I haven't been talking to for a bit texted me and asked if I was okay, I said yea why wouldn't I be and she told me that he/she thought that gf and I broke up. One of his/her friends had said that one of his friends (the guy) seemed to be dating the girl (my gf) that was dating me before. Because he saw them together at a bar when they were all hanging out as a group. I once again confronted my gf and she got super sad and mad that people were spreading rumors about her and that it would be awful if we broke up because of a rumor. She seemed very honest and I accepted her story. 

&amp;#x200B;

A couple of days later I texted the friend that told me and told her that I  didn't think my gf was at the bar. She then told me that the other guy had texted her randomly and told her not to tell anyone about him and my gf. He sent that the same day as I confronted her about the bar thing. And my friend said he/she had no idea how the other guy would know that my friend knew about them.

&amp;#x200B;

So now either my gf is lying or my really close friend that I haven't talked to as much lately is lying and I don't know what to believe. 

&amp;#x200B;

Thanksgiving is coming up and I'm supposed to go with my gf, I love her family and it's a lot of fun spending time with them. So I feel like I need to do something before that, since she already (potentially) lied about the bar I don't think she will tell the truth if I talk to her about it more, for her to admit (if it's true) I think I need to have real evidence. And if I try to break things off now I will be the bad guy and she will very hurt and sad, which will be awful since I love her and I don't want to hurt her for no reason. 

&amp;#x200B;

So that's my story. 

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR: gf might be talking to other guy, says she stopped, friend texted me that apparently my gf was at a bar with said guy, someone is lying. "
"Moved in with partners family (26 male) and relationship deteriorating...


Idk where to begin..let’s start with 2015. This year my mom had passed away, shortly after the stress got to me so much that I ended up quitting miserable job and I (26 male) was homeless for a period of time. Fortunately my partner’s (let’s call her Stacy) parents agreed to letting me move in as long as I help out with chores.

Come 2018, our relationship has deteriorated. We cannot stand being around one another, we argue about the smallest things. To add onto the stresses we have a toddler and are living in a overcrowded space.

Financially things are beginning to turn around for me individually but at the expense of losing my family (partner and child).

That’s the summary...now for the details on everyone, sorry if the story is jumpy I’m just writing off the top of my head.

There’s 8 people including our toddler living in a 2 bedroom house with one bathroom.  There’s mom, dad, sister + 2 kids age 17 and 14, plus myself, Stacy and our child.  That in itself is already a headache. 

Background on the family (Latino)

When I first met Stacy’s parents I thought they were ordinary people. I’ve come to realize their education neither parent has completed high school and one has not even finished middle school. Parents are not married and argue constantly.

Mom (Maria) is very controlling and has poor people skills. Always getting into arguments with neighbors and thinks the street parking in front of house is her designated parking spot.

Dad (Carlos) is a cool guy, easily manipulated, gossips and complains about everyone but will not say anything in person. 

Both mom and dad rather communicate by writing notes (like wash your dishes etc..) and sticking them on the door, wall, or refrigerator.

Sister (Cindy) also a cool person but sets a bad example for kids. (Influenced by drugs) Tried to get along with everyone but in reality is just trying to keep a roof over head. Had moved out with ex-abusive husband but ended up coming back. Her kids are on their phones 24/7 (Carlos complains about it). Plays explicit music around our child and I have  strong feeling his first words will be curse words smh.

After having our baby

Stacy is going to school Part time and is trying out being a dog walker on some app but hasn’t gained any traction yet.

Myself, o brought my GPA up to a 4.0 but the jobs I was working we’re not enough for coming baby. So I saved up enough  money to learn new skills for a year to pursue a career and I’m just now getting my return on investment. Just finished a short term job and have another job lined up for next year.

Carlos and Maria, since birth of child always express opinion on how we should raise our child. Anytime he cries 

Maria comes banging on door to check on baby. Not because she is checking if he is ok but because Him crying gives her anxiety.

While I was away at work, Carlos and Maria would put Stacy down and make statements about her not being a good mom, the baby cries too much and so on. However, when I am there, none of that happens whether I am alone with baby or Stacy and I are at home together.

Jumping to current times, my job has finished, and I am out of resources. I have been paying for everything (literally). Stacy’s unemployment benefits ran out sometime in July - August maybe earlier.

Since then I’ve been paying for everything. My bills, rent, her bills, baby expenses, groceries and gas. 

Ive pushes and pushed for her to start working long ago but she insisted on going to school because she doesn’t want to work a low skill job. My commute was far and costly in gas and her commute to school as well. (We have one car, my car).

Before my job ended Stacy and I discussed cutting back on expenses and come today I have a $600 credit card bill, not including all of my expenses or hers or rent and my last check from job was a little over $700.

I know being a stay at home mom in addition to the environment is stressful and the people in their are toxic I’m lost as what to do.

I’ve pitched paying for a studio apartment for them two just to get away from parents but she was too picky in terms of area.

Also forgot to mention Carlos and Maria do not want to babysit at all. Idk if it’s a cultural difference but the way I was raised family helps family. 

On a side note, Carlos and Maria refuse to help with school as well. Would never take Stacy to school even at a younger age.

I’m stressed to a point where stepping foot into house it’s like a wave of toxicity enters the body and changes my entire perspective and I feel trapped.

My escape from my reality is to continue learning but i cannot do that peacefully because Carlos works graveyard shifts so he sleeps during the day on the couch and gossips about my keyboard clicking. When I study at night Maria complains about the lights and electricity bill even though she leaves her tv on 24/7 monitoring her parking space.

Same goes for Stacy when she’s studying or doing homework.

not too long ago Stacy and i got into it about apparently I mistreat her and our child and don’t want to spend time with either of them.

I voluntarily want to take our child out for walks in the morning or to go see my family which rarely happens. I personally think Stacy doesn’t like my family. She’s willing to allow Cindy babysit but not my sister.

Side note...in her own words “she doesn’t trust her family with our child or me but because she has no choice, she leaves him with me while she’s at school.

Another side note....Maria is manipulative specially when it comes to money. The reason the house is overcrowded is so she can reduce her expense and increase savings.

Carlos pays the most rent out of everyone but is treated the worse.

I’m ranting on now...I’m lost as to what to do. Is it me? Is it her? Is it our environment? Its like I’m not even a parent to our child. I feel like I’m just being milked for money. In our argument stacy called me an asshole and I don’t do anything for her yet I’m paying for everything. I let her borrow the car for school and to see her friend and she takes our son with her so I can focus on studying.

To wrap things up, I know it all comes down to money.
When I acquire the income I’m moving the f*** out. As much as Stacy complains about her parents and claims she cannot wait to leave I doubt she will when the time comes and it sucks because I either continue to suck it up and deal with the toxic environment for the sake of our son or worse case scenario end up on child support (even though I’m technically already doing that) and she continues to live off of me while I stress and end up working a job I hate.

Idk what else to say...help lol

Btw we are engaged and been together for 4 years and living together for 3 years if that matters.."
"My [31 M] girlfriend [25 F] of 2 years thinks she may be asexual and I don't know how to proceed. Advice?


Title is the gist of it, but here is a more in-depth background:

My girlfriend and I moved in together after nearly a year of dating. Since moving in, there was a noticeable decline in sexual intimacy. I attributed this to the honeymoon effect wearing off, and we happily continued having sex a few times a week, for the first few months or so.

Ever since those first few months, sex took a huge drop-off, to the point where we were having sex once a month, if that, and less since that. Interest in sexual exploration/general kinkiness also became nonexistent. Not only that, but I could tell she was not really ""into it"" during the few times we were being intimate.

We talked about it and she saw a relationship counselor (only once, she didn't feel it helped very much). I wasn't told all the details but I did learn the psychiatrist thought she may be somewhere on the asexual spectrum, as she put it.

We have not had sex since then, however we have talked more about things. She loves me and I love her, she wants to be with me, she still finds me attractive and doesn't want to have sex with other people. She simply doesn't want to have sex, period. She has used her vibrator a few times to get a release, however just doesn't feel like having sex.

She has told me this has happened in her past relationships to a degree, but attributed the decline in desire to other issues, none of which we really have. She thinks her sexuality is really tied into the first few months of a relationship, of not knowing and seeking approval, and she almost doesn't feel sexual outside of this context.

I'm struggling with this because I know she is absolutely genuine. I know she wants to be with me, that she finds me attractive. Those things are true. But it's also true that she just does not feel like affirming those things with sexual intimacy with me.

I am floundering, I love her and want to be with her but am feeling so dejected that such an important part of our relationship, and of myself, is being neglected. I try to bring her on fun dates and give her space but nothing seems to have done anything. It's hard not to feel something deeper is going on.

Any and all advice is so welcome, thank you for taking the time to read/respond. Cheers

**TL;DR**: GF thinks she may be asexual; sex life has completely died and it's making me feel dejected. It feels like we aren't moving forward with the issue in any constructive way and it concerns me. Any advice?"
"Torn between ex and current girlfriend


I'm at a point where I have to choose between 2 girls, one is my ex of 4 years and my current girlfriend I've been seeing for about a month. I'll start off by giving some background info.

&amp;#x200B;

Ex: 

She doesn't really have a loving family and lives alone (before and after she was with me), she's lacked that sort of love/care her whole life and part of me has always felt heartache for this.

We were together for a little over 4 years, we lived together for most of the time and saw each other day in and day out. Had our honeymoon phase like most relationships and I think we let it slip into routine and complacency eventually resulting in her leaving me for someone else; from what I understand she left to find her own truth about what love/relationships were supposed to be, she believed that love = emotions and chose to pursue that instead of what we had which was compatibility, comfort, and security (not to say we did not love each other, we did). Since then she came back and has convinced me that she's learned her lessons, her truth, and that now she sees that what we had is actually what's rare, that love and commitment is a conscience choice, and that having butterflies/sparks is easy to come by and isn't everything. She also showed remorse and thinks of what she did as a mistake and regrets it.

Pros - (out of 3 +/-)

\+++ we ""get"" each other

\+++ similar upbringing/background

\++ shared views/hobbies

\++ sexual compatibility (iffy on this, it's been a while)

\+ chemistry (low due to stagnation?)

Cons - 

\--- left me once

\-- personal issues she has to work through (anxiety, etc.)

Current gf:

We've been in a relationship for a month, weren't friends prior to this, I really like her but it's still very early to really comment on a lot of things. I find her attractive and feel that though I like her personality a lot, I'm drawn to it mostly due to lust/chemistry.

Pros -

\+++ sexual compatibility

\+++ chemistry

\+ shared views

Cons -

\-- inexperienced with relationships

\- different upbringing

\- lack of shared hobbies

&amp;#x200B;

My ex came back around the time things became official with my current girlfriend and at the time I was ready to move on and told her that I didn't want to be with her. I had a number of reasons but mostly that I couldn't trust her and that she seemed to 180 back to me so quickly I didn't think her intentions were genuine. Fast forward to a month later, my ex has been respectful the whole time but I could tell that she's been really sad, and a couple days ago my ex got into an accident and I haven't been able to stop thinking about or worrying about her well being since.

I spoke to my current girlfriend and told her that I had unresolved feelings from my previous relationship I felt that I needed to work through and felt that it would be best for us to part ways so that I can go figure my shit out without stringing her a long. Long story short my current girlfriend didn't want give up on our relationship without trying and suggested that we take a 1-2 week break for me to figure things out and come out at the end with a more definite answer as to what I wanted to do.

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR: I have to choose between an ex of 4 years who left me but came back with self-discovery, learned lessons about the important of commitment and what true love is and my current girlfriend who I adore but have only been dating for a month.

I don't know where to begin but I want to figure out what I want. What should I do? Please help Reddit."
"I asked for sex on the first date and he declined. Is this bad?


I (22 F) have gone on a lot of dates this month with different guys, and most of them *always* tried to have sex with me on the first date. More importantly, most of them later told me that they were just looking for friends with benefits instead of serious relationships. 

I slowly began to accept this as a fact and believed that most guys probably want sex on the first date...until last night. I went to have dinner with this guy whom I met for the first time, and we had a great time. At the end of meal, I felt a rush and asked him if I could come over to his apartment. He said ""No, we are not going to have sex tonight. This is our first date. "" and I was left speechless. 

We hugged as we said goodbye, and I made the move of kissing him on the lips. He told me to text him once I get home, and we texted each other goodnight at the end of the night. 

I felt really ashamed afterwards - I just got rejected for sex. I kind of like this guy because he is different than all the guys I've dated, but I am afraid that I have screwed things up. What should I do?

**Tl;dr** I asked this guy if we could have sex on the first date, and he said no. What can I do to see him again?

"My (19F) bf (20M) is great but I'm losing feelings


We've been together 8 months and he moved in with me 6 months into our relationship. I left the culty religion that I grew up in, much to my parents disappointment and I got a place of my own. My bf lived abroad and we had planned for him to come to me. 

All seemed well when I went over to meet his family and he finally traveled to move in with me.
Although I've had a few stressful months with the whole moving out and managing bills on my own for the first time. 

It really took a toll on our sex life because I was just too stressed for that. But we've worked through that now.

Lately, I've been rethinking all of my decisions this year and I kind of feel trapped. I realise that living together so soon may have been a bad idea because I want my own space but also I love him... But I'm not in love with him. 

I want to go to uni, meet new people and travel and he's already ready to settle down and not be as fast paced as me. 

I don't know what to do and if I should tell him all of this. I feel bad because he's sacrificed his family back in his home country to spend his life with me. 

TL;DR I'm losing feelings for my bf after moving in with him 6 months into relationship. Should I break up?"
"My boyfriends(25M) male friends turn me on


So im extremely picky when it comes to opposite sex, but I just moved in with my boyfriend to his country, which has the sexiest accent I ever heard. We occasionally go out, and he introduces me to his circle. Its huge and full of gorgeous men with amazing accents. Sometimes we all go to bars and I get to talk to a friend of his and I can feel my chest buzzing! I feel guilty about it though, because Its not okay for me to feel this way. I feel im deceiving my bf. 

I wonder if this is how a lot of men feel around their gf’s hot female friends... 

Anyway, I just would love the idea of kissing or being with one of these friends. Im totally into a MFM threesome and have told my bf about it. He says he doesnt want to watch another guy fuck his gf... 

I dont know what to tell my bf, because i cant keep on feeling intense tension every time I meet his friends. The interactions are mixed with flirty and cute because we know we can never be together and theres a sexiness that gives! I want to tell my bf, but i also want to get something out of it sexually. My bf is a jealous man by nature so not sure how he would react ha... i also am jealous and would hate it if he felt this was about my friends. 

Tldr; by has hot friends and i feel guilty for feeling tension every time we meet them"
"Ex [21 M] is angry that I hooked up with someone 3 months after he dumped me [21 F]


tl;dr: In a relationship for almost 2 years, got dumped by bf the same day a family member dies, and he says he liked someone while we were still together. 3 months after he dumps me, I hook up with someone he's insecure over, and he loses it saying I should have said something to him and how could I go to the one person we had issues over. Over a year later, I get shit for what I have done despite how he handled the entire situation in the first place. What do I even do?

&amp;#x200B;

I was in a relationship for almost 2 years during college (21 months to be exact), and had made future plans on doing so many things together, and spoke about marriage and children. I got dumped last summer the same day I found out my grandfather passed away (an absolute shock on both ends) because he wanted to focus on himself, and distance was going to be difficult (he decided to go to a different continent for an internship and we wouldn't see each other for 6 months, + I would graduate a year earlier than he was). I still loved him and was willing to forgive him if he asked to be together again when he came back. A month later, he messages me and tells me that another reason he broke up with me was because he caught feelings for some girl while we were together, that he met once at some street fair. I was completely floored by this because this girl and him were just acquaintances, and they never spoke to each other, and then all of a sudden he decides to dump me because he thinks she could be the one. In the coming few weeks, he would tell me about how much he liked this girl, and how he wanted to take her places, and hoped she liked him back too (and he had a 'feeling' that she did).

Fast forward to 3 months later where I'm in my last year of classes, and I hooked up with a guy that we both knew. This guy was someone he had issues with and was insecure over (as I had liked this guy before. Full disclosure - I lost all feelings for him completely after a few months, and did not have any romantic inclinations once my ex and I got together). Ex found out about it before I had the chance to speak to him about it, and went ballistic, saying that I should have had the courtesy to tell him about it, and how could I have fucked the one guy he had issues with. Of course, looking back (it has been a year since this incident), I do agree that it was a mistake and I wish I never did it, but we were both drunk then and both were single. I wish I did say something to my ex sooner and just given him a heads up, but I did not, and I accept that. Ex removed me from all social media accounts and we don't speak from September to February.

Ex then comes back from his internship, and I hear he hasn't pursued the girl that he dumped me for, and on my birthday, someone brings his name up and I start full-on crying because I realize I still miss him and love him. He hears, and decides to meet me, and start an on-off relationship. Feelings for that girl somewhat diminished but still has a small thing. Then he decides that there's another girl who he has been talking to and is a friend of his (who he hasn't met in almost 10 years) that he thinks might also be someone he could like. Needless to say, he and I would be fighting every other week, because I still loved him and was willing to give him a chance after all that had happened, and I thought he loved me too (but he would still bring up how I hooked up with the other guy and guilted me into that being the state we were in). We decided to end our relationship in the summer.

This past summer, we were driving to go somewhere (and this was my first time driving on a highway for a long period, and I almost successfully made it to my destination). We get into a small fender bender, but thankfully all parties were okay. A month after that accident (which my family doesn't know happened, and I have not driven since, because every time I think I'm ready, I start feeling very panicky), he messages me saying I should have been more careful while driving (even though the cop told both him and me that it was the other person's fault and I had done the right thing by braking on time at the light). Still, I carried a lot of guilt from that accident and to hear someone say that maybe I would have realized how much someone was worth after they died got to me, and he decides to remove me from all social media accounts again and cuts off contact. I started drinking heavily every weekend and wasn't sure how to handle all the guilt that came from the accident (as he is the last person I would want to get hurt in an accident and I lost even more confidence in my driving) and how we had ended. I considered therapy (and still am, to cope over all this).

Fast forward to a few weeks ago when I get a message from him where he asks how I'm doing, and make small talk. He apologizes for the comment he made about the accident and said that it was not my fault, and he shouldn't have handled it the way he did (as this could have been our chance to strengthen our bond but he chose otherwise). He joined therapy for some of his issues too, which I was happy about, because he has someone to speak to and help him. We spoke here and there some more (him messaging almost always except one time where I wished him for a holiday). He would say things like how he missed me and it felt so different for him to be in his last year of school while I wasn't there. I miss him too, but I wasn't sure what I could do because we weren't living in the same area anymore, and he was applying for jobs all over the country. He also just fought with me so much and I just didn't think it made sense to feed into something that could end up hurting both of us again. 

2 days ago, he messages me and said some of the most nastiest things I've heard in my life. Said I was a hoe and a slut for screwing some guy that got in the way of our relationship (even after I hooked up with said person after we broke up), and wished I would die. He said I was a terrible person and had no idea how relationships worked, and he was the one guy who was everything for me, and I couldn't find anyone better. I didn't respond to him because I was on vacation but he messaged me again the next day asking why I hadn't responded, and how I wasn't brave enough to say anything or face my issues (not true as I am a pretty outspoken person and did not want to say something or else he would twist my words and continue arguing some more. I am trying to be more mature but he doesn't seem to like that). I have always told him that I regretted what I did, and have apologized numerous times, and am not sure what I can say at this point. I forgave him for how he broke up with me while I was grieving over a death and when he liked the girl(s), which took a long time. This time however, I just said that I said whatever that needed to be said before, and wished him well for his future. He blocked my number so I don't think he got my message, and has blocked me on Facebook as well. His brother removed me from social media too.

Is all of this my fault? I have numerous friends who have told me that he is acting immature over all that he has done to me, but I still feel guilty that I didn't say anything when I hooked up with the guy (and I already know that I should have, and wished I never did it in the first place)."
"I(32f) think I made a big mistake getting back with my ex(30m) and I feel stuck now


 I think I know what I'm going to be told, but I have a history of doubting myself and misjudging situations so I need some objective opinions.

3 weeks ago I got back together with my ex. We had broken up last year because of his drinking and general immaturity. We didn't speak for a long time until recently when I finally decided to let him start coming to see his son again during summer of this year. Yes, we have a child together which complicates this whole mess infinitely.

Anyway, we started talking a lot over the last few months and it seemed like he had gotten his shit together- holding a job, not drinking all the time, coming to see his son regularly, etc- so when he started telling me how much he still loved me and wanted us to be a family, I decided to give him another chance. That was about 3 weeks ago. Since then, I feel like I've made a huge, stupid mistake and I need you guys to tell me if the following are the massive red flags they seem to be or if he's just going through a bad time and I should stick it out so my son can have a family.

Incident 1: On the night we got back together, I'm giving him a ride home when he gets a call from a cop demanding that someone come pick up his cousin who was found wandering around a random neighborhood in another city, completely shitfaced. I'm too nice, so I speak to the officer and assure him I'll be there soon to collect the moron. When we pick him up, they're both laughing at the situation as if it's all just cheeky fun and not some utterly ridiculous BS that a man in his 30s was wandering around outside drunk at 2am. This kind of shit used to happen all the time and was part of the reason I left last year. This cousin is a raging alcoholic that always gets himself and my BF into trouble whenever they hang out, and I usually have to be the one to pick them up from the bar to avoid one or both of them getting thrown in the drunk tank overnight. I refuse to deal with this shit anymore so I told BF that this better be a one-and-done incident, and he assured me it would be.

Incident 2: Not even a week goes by and I get a call that my BF got arrested for driving with expired tags and no insurance. I'm pissed, but I also think it's kind of bullshit to haul a person off to jail for something this petty. I know how easy it is to forget to renew your tags, hell I've let mine lapse before too. I don't want him losing his job, plus his dear sweet mother whom I adore begged me to help him cause she was broke so I shelled out several hundred dollars for bail which he swears he'll pay me back for. He has since gotten insurance and his tags, so that's progress I guess so I let it go.

Incident 3: Several nights ago I get a call from BF and he's slurring his words. He's drunk. I immediately got really mad cause one of the conditions of us getting back together was no more going out partying and getting drunk. A few beers is fine, but getting drunk is **not**. Drunk is when he gets in trouble, spends money, and does stupid shit. He swears up and down that he's only had two beers, which then became 3 beers that his friend bought him, which *then* became 3 beers and 2 shots that he himself spent $40 on. So not only did he break his end of the no-drinking deal, he's spending money on alcohol instead of paying me back. I got royally pissed and told him how disappointed I was with him, and the whole time he's arguing with me, lying and saying he's not drunk and he didn't spend any money literally right after he TOLD me how much he spent and drank. He even puts his friend on the phone to 'calm me down'. This random friend of his that he just met a few weeks ago starts trying to convince me that it's no big deal, they were just having a boys night, and I need to cut him some slack. He has no idea the hell my BF has put me through with his drinking, he just hears a hysterical woman giving her man a hard time. I was so angry I was crying and shaking, and I very nearly broke up with him right then and there.

Incident 3a: That same night he gets home and calls me again, still drunk and can't understand why I'm mad. He plays the victim card, saying he didn't do anything wrong and I'm just giving him a hard time. Then starts crying about how he can't lose me, he'll do anything, he's a piece of shit and he knows he has a problem, etc. So I tell him he needs to go to treatment for his drinking and get his shit together for real or I will leave him for good. The line then goes dead and I can't get a hold of him for several hours. Even though I'm beyond pissed at this point I start to get worried, thinking he fell and broke his neck or something, but then he finally calls me back. He tells me he got upset and punched a hole in his wall and broke his xbox controller. Sorry- MY xbox controller, that I'd lent him. What. The. FUCK.

Incident 4: The next night, he's bored and wants to play a game but obviously has no controller now. He complained about it to me a bit, I said it sucks and I'm sorry he's bored, and then he sent me a venmo request for $30 so he could go buy a new controller. I was stunned. I was still trying to be nice so I said I couldn't afford it instead of asking WTF was wrong with him. I have a good job and he knows I CAN afford it though, so he asks how much money I have and points out that I just got a new phone and bought myself a few other things over the weekend, seemingly guilting me for spending money on myself and not him. At this point I'm really heated. Aside from the fact that it's my hard-earned money and I can spend it however I damn well please and I don't owe him shit- I just spent hundreds on his bail, I've given him numerous little loans of $20-$40 here and there over the months prior when he was broke and needed gas/food, none of which I've been paid back even a single cent for, yet he has the absolute gall to grill me about my finances and pout at me for money to replace MY controller that HE broke after getting drunk, which he PROMISED me he wouldn't do. Is he serious?! I refused to replace it. In fact I'll throw that GD xbox off a cliff before I replace that controller. He can just suffer and be bored until he can afford to replace it himself.

I dunno... I have a skewed sense of what's healthy in a relationship due to a lot of abuse in my past, but I feel like this is just way too much crap for being back together not even a month yet. I do love the guy and I want us to be a family, he is very sweet and affectionate and he absolutely loves being a father, but I'm getting spooked by all these shenanigans. I don't think he's changed at all, and I almost feel like I'm being taken advantage of. I make significantly more money than him and I've offered to get him a job where I work, but he'd rather stay in his dead-end job because it's *fun*. He's perpetually broke and I feel like I'm going to be supporting both our son and him if I stay, and I am NOT okay with that. I'm my son's mommy, not my boyfriend's. I don't want my son growing up witnessing all this nonsense and thinking it's okay. Whenever he's sober he admits he has a problem and promises me he'll stop/get help, but I've been hearing this promise with no real follow-through for a year and a half now. I hesitate to just leave cause of how much he loves his son, how much he loves me, and how much I want my son to grow up with both parents together. His mom is so happy that we're back together too(and she's totally on my side with the drinking stuff, she's not enabling him or making excuses). She loves me to death and would likely disown him if he screwed up the relationship again. I almost feel obligated to stay just for *her*. I know he's gonna end up drunk again soon, and I almost feel like I should just put up with it for the sake of my son being able to grow up in a real family, and just do my best to make sure he never sees daddy drunk. I don't want my son getting dragged through custody battles and courts, and it's just easier if mom &amp; dad are together.

TL;DR: Got back with my ex who I left last year due to his drinking. He's a good person and he means well but he does a lot of stupid shit. He seemed to have changed/grown up, but since we've been back together I've had to bail him out of jail, he got piss-drunk after promising me he was done with that lifestyle, he broke my game controller while drunk, and then dared to ask me for money to buy another one. I feel like I should break up with him again but he's a good dad to our child, he loves me to death, and everyone is super happy that we're back together. I feel like a damn idiot and I don't know what to do.

"my BF [25M] is upset that I [22F] am uncomfortable with his family and do not want to attend their thanksgiving dinner after finding out that he badmouthed me to them


recently, i found out that my boyfriend tends to rant about me and detail our arguments to his family and friends - for example, we had an argument on text a few weeks ago, and he sent screenshots of our entire conversation to his family and they responded with negative comments about me.

his family has invited me to come over for their family get together and thanksgiving dinner to which i declined (i told them i was busy with family as well), and i told him that i was uncomfortable. to this, he has expressed discontent and became distant, cancelled all of our planned dates (he said he wanted to spend the days with his family coming to town, which is understandable), and i have barely heard from him.

was i wrong to decline their invitation?

"I [34F] have decided to have a baby but recently started dating a great man [31M]. I don't want to scare him off but realize I have to tell him eventually. Help?


I was married from 19-25. Big mistake. We got divorced and I took some time to myself, reentering the dating world again at about 28. Since then I haven't had great luck. I've met a few good guys here and there but nothing that lasted. I've done everything from trying to meet guys at bars, to joining organizations, to online dating, to speed dating. Nothing. 

I want to be a mom and always have. Last year I decided to go about it through a sperm bank. I'm not getting any younger and I can't afford to wait around for a husband. I've narrowed it down to one fertility clinic in my city that I love and am all but ready to pull the trigger. I've been holding off a bit but really everything is done but deciding to just do it. 

Back in July I met this really great guy. We went on a few dates and then he had to go out of the country for work for about a month so things fizzled. But when he came back we picked up right where we left off and things have been great. Neither of us is ignorant about our age: we've discussed marriage, kids, the whole nine yards. Obviously not making any promises but it's stuff we both want.

The only thing I haven't told him is that I am planning on getting pregnant. I am still going to go through with it. I can't afford to bet on him and have it not work out. So this really isn't a matter of ""discussing my options."" 

I need advice on how to tell him without sending him running for the hills. I really, really like this guy. I haven't felt this compatible with a guy...ever. I didn't even feel this way about my husband. And I know it's *so* early still, but I don't want to lose out on something great.

My track record shows I'm not the greatest with relationships. I need help. How do I do this? What to do I say? When do I say it? Do I say anything at all, or just cut the poor man free without trying to bring him into my mess? 

**TL;DR: I'm going to have a baby soon through sperm donor. I met an amazing guy and don't want to scare him off. How do I tell him?** "

"I (40M) am growing increasingly obsessed with my wifes (36F) intimate behavior


Basically what the title says. My wife has found a resurgence of her sexuality in the form of masturbation.  Which would normally be a great thing, except she purposely keeps it hidden from me. We have been married 16 years now. We have an otherwise normal and great relationship, and are very open about things. Both of us have struggled with some serious issues in the past, and we have been quite honest, and supportive of each other right from the start. Every situation, no matter how embarrassing, upsetting, irrational, etc. has always been put out in the open and discussed immediately. We always talk about how thats a key to our marraiges success and happiness.

 

A few months ago i started noticing slightly strange behavior from my wife. Nothing major, just a little weird, like popping up from the bed really fast, or quickly coming around the corner, etc. One time i took her hand to tell her something exciting, and it was a little wet, and i smelled it, and it smelled like her. I asked her, and she denied it, and we went about our day. One time i was on the computer just around the corner, and she thought it couldnt see and i saw her playing with herself.  Now this is really hot. I already have a voyeurism fetish, and well......what man doesnt want to see a beautiful woman he loves enjoying herself right?   But she never said anything to me, and when she finished, she came in the room and lied told me she just finished cleaning the bathroom.  The next time i kinda peeked around the corner on her, and she was doing it again, so i got turned on, and thought to join in. But when i came in, she stopped and pretending like she was reading a book (even though it was pretty obvious). She denied masturbating, so i asked her point blank if she was embarrassed, or felt like she couldnt do it with me, etc. She said no, and that if she was, she would have no problem doing it around me. I tried to talk to her a couple times, that i liked it, or if she wanted to go solo thats no problem. but she adamantly denies it.

&amp;#x200B;

Now for the record, neither of us are against masturbation. Weve never spoken down about it, or made fun of each other or anything. And its ocassionally, but rarely, been something we have used in our sex life. Sometimes i jerk off when she is gone, and i wouldnt be surprised if she did the same while i was gone.  We've been married almost 2 decades, Its not exactly a taboo subject. We both understand its not a ""sin"" and not something we have to tell each other ALL the time about. Sometimes it comes up (i totally got off today to the memory of that time when we.....), and sometimes it doesnt. Ive tried to bring it up, and let her know how it makes me feel, or just to ask her. But it always gets shut down immediately that no, she isnt doing that, and the subject changes.

&amp;#x200B;

My obsession with it is escalating at a scary speed. Its only been a few months, but its a constant thought of mine. I dont know which is stronger, the sexual fetish of it that turns me on, or the need to get information and find out the truth of whats really going on. Both feel extremely strong. Either way, without permission, its not really my business, which i understand in theory, but not in practice. I have already done some creepy things. Peeking around corners, turning on a shower but not getting in to go spy, moving a mirror to see around the corner. And ive started even worse things like researching spycams and computer monitoring software, which is unethical at best, and illegal at worst (i havent done any of that at all at this point). This is so out of character for me, and not once in 16 years have i thought about those kinds of things. I feel like if she didnt go out of her way to deny it, it wouldnt be a thing. Ive never had weird feelings about what she did in private before when it was open discussion.  It affects our relationship because it makes me look at my wife distrustingly and totally different.  Its becoming an issue because im getting sneaky around her. both in a sexual fetish way, but also in an overbearing dickhead way. If i try to bust her, and im wrong, i just look like an asshole being weird myself. and with good reason, cause well....i am becoming an asshole being weird.

 Her masturbating has ramped up as well (probably not as much as i think though to be honest), but ive caught her multiple times in a single day, and i noticed that while our sex life is good, she no longer initiates it, which makes me feel that at this point she would just prefer herself.  I dont question her fidelity. Her sneaky behavior is only around the house, and her phone/computer have always been shared and open. plus most of the time she doesnt have an electronic device with her when she masturbates anyway.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

How can i make myself leave this issue alone if she doesnt wanna talk about it, and keep myself from crossing the line (more) into her privacy. I dont want there to be secrets and hiding, but at the same time, i need to find that balance."
