"[Update] I[21M] asked my study partner [19F] out for a meal? Is she letting me down gently?


[Original Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/brkdtp/i21m_asked_my_study_partner_19f_out_for_a_meal_is/?ref=share&amp;ref_source=link)

So I wanted to make an update post to my previous post just to have it out there. 

Well after that previous post, I was left with a feeling of uncertainty, ""was she letting me down gently?"" ""does she really not like tacos?"" ""what if this... what if that"" and knowing myself I knew I would never be at peace without closure, so what did I do? I decided to man up and ask her out in person... So heres how that went.

We worked on some homework today and as we were walking back home, right before we parted ways I started to chicken out. Well we parted ways and as we were walking our own separate ways something in me kicked in and I turned around and called after her. I then asked her if she'd like to watch a movie sometime to which she seemed a bit caught off guard by. She asked ""where""""what movie"" etc etc... and just from the facial expressions she was giving I could tell that she was trying to figure out a way to politely decline .. She didnt say no,, but she didnt have to.. I didnt want to push her anymore so I took the hint and we parted ways. She seemed more crushed than I did. 

At least now I know. It's ok, she's still a great girl and I'm glad I asked .

**TL;DR; : She said no"
"[Update]Friend [37/F] is about to be turned-down for a promotion she has dreamed of for years. I [36/F] know it's coming and don't know how to support her or what to do.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Lordy. Where do I begin. I need more help. 

&amp;#x200B;

The guy they wanted took the job - way more than they initially wanted to spend. My friend was devastated. I followed the advice here and told her she did a great job and how proud I was of her, but the other guy did an amazing job and I didn't know what would happen. She was confident that she was going to win - she had more experience with the company vs. his experience &amp; education. At 4:55 she got a call thanking her but that they went in a different direction. HR offered to meet to discuss how she could improve and to stabilize working relations with the new guy. Shortly there after it was announced company-wide he had agreed to take the job and they were thrilled. She took the following couple of days off and didn't respond to text or email. She just completely took some time away (fair enough). She returned mid-next week and found-out that he wasn't going to start until a couple of weeks later and that she had time. Then a company-wide email went out announcing that not only had he finished the final requirements for his MBA and took first place in his final case competition beating every other school in the country but that he was starting sooner than anticipated. A lot of emphasis was placed on his Ivy League education, which really irked Tina. 

&amp;#x200B;

He would come in occasionally (before his start date) to meet with senior executives and his team members and pushed them to get unvarnished thoughts - a lot of them really complained about working conditions on the team and major obstacles they faced. A few really told him the unvarnished truth. 

&amp;#x200B;

His start date rolled around there after, and the hype was real. He hit the ground running and his first week was incredibly busy. On day one he held an open meeting where he came in and immediately banned weekend emails (some teams were expected to check/respond to emails 7 days a week), gave staff commensurate working hours to the rest of the company (we never got summer hours or flex time, which he immediately changed) and followed-up on promises made by previous staff. He rolled out new processes, budget models and is a far more effective at advocate for the team - so much so that all the old time staff have become his ""followers"". A lot of people were worried about being fired (performance had been way down) but we're already seeing a glimmer of hope - the cuts he made preserved his staff, meaning they have a little less cash to spend but a lot more bodies doing the work. All told, they're better off now ( three weeks in) than we were this time last year. The staff love him, he's very approachable, informal and because of his connections to senior leaders in other departments, that team gets a lot more attention than we used to. Our old boss was sweet and kind, but she was incredibly ineffective. I'm considering transferring back into that unit because the working environment is better than where we are. 

&amp;#x200B;

The problem has become Tina. She's tried to question his leadership, she's openly annoyed with colleagues and feels like she's the only person who doesn't ""see"" the truth. The value in the new guy is his ability to change - our teams work in close collaboration and their team is a lot more productive now than before and are getting better quality work done - they've started conversations with old clients and the business funnel has grown. VPs openly comment that he'll be moved up in short order. Yet, Tina holds are horrible grudge. It's obvious with how she interacts with staff and colleagues; she complains when he's not in the office and complains when he is in the office. I know of a least a few people who are growing weary of this and two have asked me to say something to Tina (since we're friends). Another threatened to go to HR. 

&amp;#x200B;

For all his connections and Ivy League education, the guy is also a really strong performer. He has an activity board up showing process and change and people feel less dour, except Tina. She's complaining non-stop. It's impacted our relationship to the point where I've been avoiding her. It's been two months since she found out and three weeks since he started, and I feel like ""enough is enough"" that said, she's a single mom and I don't want to see her fired for being silly. 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm really not good with confronting people, I don't know what I should say. 

&amp;#x200B;

tl;dr the new guy started and the hype was real. he's been great but Tina took rejection so badly that I'm worried she's going to be fired. I'm not sure how to handle this. She's going to get fired if she doesn't stop complaining and people want me to speak with her."
"My mother (f38) lied to my entire family and my step-dad (m32) who is now leaving us, I don’t know what to do now and I’m freaking out


(Sorry this is my first ever post and I’m on mobile, hopefully this makes sense)

My mom recently went on a work trip with her co-worker, but after my step-dad found on Facebook that she was actually in Indiana, we all soon figured out that she went there to see a prison inmate. 

We have no idea who this person is, we don’t know anybody in the prison system but recently my mom has been secretly making phone calls to an inmate we had no idea existed. She’d go take a call outside in or in her car, we all thought it was work but it wasn’t. 

My mom and step-dad also bought a house recently and we haven’t moved in yet. My step-dad is a great guy and he didn’t deserve to be lied to. My mom has a past history of lying like this and has also abandoned our family before and the reason I’m so upset because my step-dad is packing and leaving, he’s the only one that is teaching me how to drive and he’s super resourceful. When he leaves I won’t be getting driving lessons anymore and my mom probably won’t afford to keep the house they just bought. 

Everything is just so chaotic right now and I really don’t know what to do. Our stuff is barely moved in and since my step-dad is leaving, our family will literally fall apart. I can’t trust my mom anymore and I think she will abandon us again. I just don’t know what to do. I’m freaking out.

tl;dr - my mother lied to my family and it’s making my step-dad is leaving, i don’t know what to do now"
"[UPDATE] My (26F) father (55M) contacted me out of the blue yesterday after 13 years. He wants to reconnect. Is it worth even trying?


Original post: https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/brh5h8/my_26f_father_55m_contacted_me_out_of_the_blue/

Hi all,

Thought I would update you on what happened since my last post. And I want to thank everyone again for all the advice, it really helped me make a decision.

So, I decided to email him back, to try and find out why he was coming back now, after all these years, out of nowhere. And oh boy, am I glad for not having jumped all in...

Instead of telling you guys what happened, I think simply translating the emails (with all names redacted of course) will make it much easier to follow. So here we go.

Here's the email I sent him, in response to his first messages to try and reconnect. Not a very nice email, I know, but I wanted to see if he had really changed and if he was actually ready to apologize or at least recognize what he'd done wrong.

- - - - 

Hi,

Email not easy to read (nor write). Just trying to be honest here.

I don’t have an answer to give you yet, I’m thinking about it, I can’t get past 13 years and tell myself “let’s forget everything and start from scratch” in 2 days. I need to think, given the situation.

But I do have a question for you – why now ? Your answer won’t influence my decision, I just need to understand. My first reaction when reading your emails was ""is he dying ?"". Try to understand, 13 years with no contact and I receive this on a Monday morning, out of the blue, it brings up a lot of questions in my head.

And it’s not like nothing’s happened in these 13 years. Maybe it would be easier if that were the case (or maybe not, I don’t know).

The last I heard anything about you, via other people, was 2 years ago when gran was ill. 2 years. That’s not long ago, and I’m still recovering from that period. The last 2 years may have been the most difficult years of my life. 2 years of depression, thinking about gran every single day, being mad at you for not contacting me, hating you for not even telling me when the funerals were gonna take place, and because of all this, I won’t ever be able to get closure. And yes I also have some blame in there, don’t think I haven’t been mad at myself during the last 2 years as well. I will be mad at myself, and at you, probably my whole life, this story is not something I will ever be able to just forget.

Trying to reconnect at that time, 2 years ago, might have seemed more logical to me. When a family goes through this kind of thing, with a family member very sick, they have to get closer to each other, around that family member. At least, that’s what I thought. But instead, I had people telling me you got angry at them for just letting me know gran was sick. Like I didn’t have the right to know about it ? At that time, it seemed very clear to me that I wasn’t part of your family at all, and that you wanted me to stay as far away as possible. I felt your hatred, which I never managed to understand.

Whatever happened between you and me, I’d always hoped, until then, that if whatever happened for gran, I would receive a quick email, or a message on FB, anything, just to let me know what was going on. But no. So I’ve had to try and grieve gran without being able to say goodbye, and I’ve had to accept the fact that my dad wanted nothing to do with me. It’s far from easy, hence 2 years of depression.

All the arguments around money, the stories between you and mom, or even the stories between us and [new wife], all of that is very old for me. So old that today, I can’t remember everything that has happened. So it could be easy to forget about these, if there was all there is to it. But what happened with gran is something I am still feeling today and is much harder to get past.

So yes, my question is, why now and not 2 years ago ? I will wait for your answer.

I know reading this email can’t be easy, as I said before, it was far from easy to write as well. But if you truly want to reconnect, on my end I need to understand before I make any kind of decision. 

- - -

He then replied, and his email made me the angriest I had ever been before. Since my following reply includes his whole email (I replied inline), I'll just paste my reply and you'll have his email at the same time. Here goes.

- - -

HIM: Ok, let’s be honest and speak freely : let’s talk about gran, poor her, my she rest in peace. I think your relationship with her was more than occasional and that at one point, she got tired only of only being contacted for your birthday,

ME: &gt;&gt; So already here, no. Just, no. My relationship with gran was very good at the time. I was at Uni and I would go spend the weekend at her place very often. We would play Yams, I would make pizzas, etc. I have lots of good memories of that period. So, no.

HIM: that’s why the last years of her life she had cut contact with you (yeaah, still a money argument !).

ME: &gt;&gt; And no again. I remember perfectly the last conversation I’d had with her. I was calling her to tell her I just passed my License Degree. And she was mad after you told her that we had apparently “stolen your money”. And she just hung up. So no, I am not to blame here. You’ve taken enough from me, I won’t let you tarnish my memories of her.
And what you probably don’t know, is that she asked for my forgiveness, when I went to see her 2 years ago. She knew perfectly what happened, and knew I wasn’t to blame in the story. So, just, no. When I went to see her at Uni, I would always try to avoid talking about my relationship with her, to try not to make her sadder that she already was. While on your side, you decided to bury me and break my relationship with her. So if someone is to blame here, that’s you, certainly not me. MY fault, was to accept it without saying anything, and not trying to reconnect after a while. And yes, I blame myself for that. But for everything else, you’re gonna have to wake up at some point and accept the consequenses of your actions.

HIM: By the way, quickly on the side, not having any contact with me, ok, but why did you cut ties with [new kids], they didn’t have anything to do with the situation, [new wife] has always felt really affected about this.

ME: &gt;&gt; I wasn't against them. But you lived together. If they’d tried to contact me, I wouldn’t have said no, far from it. But here again, you’re putting all the blame on me, that’s quite easy.

HIM: Getting back to gran, indeed, I didn’t warn you when she got sick, nor when she died, because, and I’ll be perfect honest here, I imagined you coming out of nowhere, without warning anyone, without having taken any news from her for years, and I imagined you coming to do the inventory.

ME: &gt;&gt; Funny, that’s EXACTLY what I told [gran’s best friend] at the time. It’s crazy how you’re turning the situation around to your advantage. Let’s be clear, right now. I DON’T GIVE A CRAP about your money. And when I heard about gran, no, I wasn’t the devil you created in your head, I just wanted to see her, for me, and for her. NO SHITS GIVEN about the f***ing inventory. If that was what I cared about, no need to go see her, I could have just found you or taken a lawyer. 

HIM: It’s because you cut ties with gran that I didn’t want you there and that I didn’t try to reconnect back then. We were very shocked at the time, with gran’s best friend, about the way you acted. So no, it was absolutely not a question for me to try and reconnect with you then.

ME: &gt;&gt; The way I acted. Nobody thought that maybe, just maybe, I needed a moment to process what was going on? Years with no news, and the whole situation gets thrown at me out of nowhere, with no warning. When I received the FB message, 2 days later I was on a plane to go see her. Afterwards yes, I took too long to call her again when I got back home. And yes, I blame myself for it. But here again, it’s very easy to paint me as a devil, without having even tried to understand what was going on in my head.

HIM: To answer your question, « why now », well I’m asking myself the same. It’s been weeks, months that I’m thinking about it and I’m trying to let my heart speak instead of my brain.

ME: &gt;&gt; Your heart ? Seriously ? I don’t see anything in this email that shows me you even have one.

HIM: And at the same time, if I didn’t do this, would you have done it ? I’ve gone through my past, persuaded myself that I needed to stop banging on about my resentment towards you which also had consequences on your sister who didn’t do anything.

ME: &gt;&gt; Here congratulations, this is the best I’ve heard all year. So you’re basically trying the blame the fact that YOU cut ties with her, on me. I must be dreaming. Nobody ever prevented you from taking her on weekends or during holidays, when I decided to stop coming. By the way, legally, you HAD to continue seeing her. But no, you’re right, that must be on me again !

HIM: It’s not only during « grand happenings » that you’re supposed to get news from your family or try to reconnect. By the way, I am to blame regarding your sister, for not continuing to reply to her messages since 2008. 

ME: &gt;&gt; Oh, wow, you’re actually accepting part of the blame. It’s gonna snow.

So, to recap your email :

· You have absolutely not changed one bit. You stay the manipulator you were 10 years ago.

· You are a First Class mythomaniac. You’ve invented a diabolical version of me, your daughter, and truly believe your own lies.

· Obviously, you’re pushing all the blame onto me (why not, after all, I am a devil who wants to take all of your money).

· And, of course, you’re not apologising for anything.

So my answer is an absolute no. I officially do not want anything to do with you anymore. If at your age, you still don’t realise that the life you invented for yourself is a huge mass of lies, sad for you, but on my end I will continue living, knowing you once and for all out of my life. I managed the last 10 years, I will live even better now that this whole thing is finally over. So, maybe, thank you! Thanks for proving to me that I was right about you, and that I shouldn’t spend even 1 more second thinking about you. My goal with yesterday’s email was to see if you had changed, I have my answer.

Don’t even try to reply to this email. I am blocking you, and if that doesn’t work, I will simply delete every single of your messages when they come in, without reading them. I won’t give you the chance to explain yourself, you just did, everything is clear as day on my end now.

I’m going to bring back a sentence you sent me years ago, when I had tried to reconnect. You said “if for you, I don’t have a wife, then I don’t have daughters anymore.”. Well today, I am telling you : if you don’t have a daughter, then I don’t have a father anymore.

Do not EVER try to contact me again. I hope that is clear. Not tomorrow, not a year from now, not even on your deathbed. For me, you died today.

- - -

And there we go! Yes, I know, I've been downright nasty. But honestly, I think I needed to get it all out. After reading his email, I felt like I was going to burst out in flames, he reaaaaally pissed me off.

And I feel so much better now. It's like, maybe I needed to push all my anger out, to feel 'free' in a way. I don't know how to explain it, but I feel so much lighter now, I haven't felt like this for years.

Feel free to comment of course and let me know your thoughts on the email exchange. And again, thank you all so much for the support. I wouldn't have managed to do this without you guys.

TL;DR: I replied to his email, telling him how I felt about the whole thing and especially about my gran. I wanted to see if he'd changed. He very much did not."
"How do I (33/f) stop resenting my husband (33/m)?


My husband and I have been together  15 years and married for 11. He’s a physician in the US which, as most everyone knows, comes with a hefty price tag. We got married right out of undergrad and the summer before he started medical school. I had to change which masters program i was going to last minute but i was able to get in and get a job and was able to support the both of us with this job (that I loved) while he finished med school. When he graduated, he got a residency in another state (and barely even consulted me about it before he applied and interviewed and decided. I put it behind me and packed up and moved with him and was luckily able to find another job that was better salary wise but I hated and was able to fully support us both while he was able to put all of the money he made in residency towards his student loans. After he finished, I was able to get a different job thats better than I ever could’ve dreamed of and got a major promotion near the end of 2018.

Since January 2019 my husband has been pushing for us to start trying for a baby. He also doesnt want strangers “raising” his children so he doesn’t want to put them in daycare or have a nanny when we have them. We also don’t have any family close by nor do we have any friends that would be able to take on that responsibility. He also doesn’t want to quit his job or go down to part time in his job to take care of said kids, but he expects me to be a stay at home mom. I’m not ready for a baby right now.  I’m not ready to sideline my career and leave my dream job that I have worked my ass off for.  I told him as much which resulted in a fight where he told me that I should leave my job because his is more important than mine since he “saves lives everyday” and I don’t and ultimately most people could do my job with a “little bit of common sense” whereas his is way more than just sitting at a desk all day (which I don’t even do). When the subject of kids came up years ago, he said no because he wasn’t ready and wanted to finish his education. Despite what I wanted, I accepted it and moved on because I understood where he was coming from and respected his feelings.  When I brought this up he said I was throwing it in his face and making him feel guilty for wanting to pursue his dreams. 

I had to walk away because I was so furious and hurt by what he said. And since that fight, I’ve been thinking about it over and over and have found  myself thinking things i probably shouldn’t and wanting to bring up how my unimportant career supported his ass while he accomplished his dreams but he didn’t complain about how unimportant it was then. I supported him mentally, emotionally, and physically too and if he was up at home studying I was up helping him study, I made sure his clothes were clean and that he ate and slept and was comfortable when he came home after he had a long day despite me also having a long day. I dealt with my father passing away on my own because he was unavailable due to his training. I gave up my dream program, my original dream job, the place I loved and wanted to live forever and my desire to have kids so that he could accomplish his goals. I was depressed and miserable for years at a job I didn’t like, in a city that I hated because it meant he was able get what he wanted in life. I know you’re not supposed to do things with the intention of being paid back or “keeping score” but I did all of those things because I love my husband and expected that, at the VERY LEAST, he would respect me and my career and be understanding and supportive of my wants and needs like I have been with him since the moment we got married. It just seems like I’m the only one sacrificing and being selfless in our marriage. And not only that but my job is important. I may not be an MD or “saving lives” in the moment but I am making a significant difference and change in the lives of my patients and helping improve their quality of life and leading them to be healthier overall and work alongside several physicians who have recognized the positive impact I’ve had on the lives of many people yet the one who matters most to me doesn’t recognize or believe this and it hurts like hell honestly.  I’m mad and hurt right now but I know that if the resentment fully sets in it’ll be the worst case scenario. How do I stop this from happening and how do I stop feeling this way towards my husband? 

Tl;Dr: Husband is being a jerk about my career and I feel myself starting to resent him and don’t want these feelings to get any worse towards him. How can I stop having these thoughts about him and our marriage?"
"I [24F] cancelled my wedding after my ex-fiance [33M] cheated at his bachelor party. It's two months later and he won't leave me alone.


To make a long story short, my ex-fiance got a handjob and made out with a woman during his bachelor party 2 weeks before our wedding. I found out a few nights later when one of his friends with a guilty conscience told me. At first, I was devastated. I truly loved him with every fiber of my being and I felt like someone ripped my heart out. It was an earth shattering feeling. I also felt like an idiot because he had cheated on me when we were dating so I felt like I almost deserved it or at least seen it coming. Not only that, but all the money, time, and effort spent planning the wedding just a complete waste.

I confronted him, he confessed but downplayed it. Said it didn't mean anything, he felt pressured because it was ""his last night of freedom,"" and when he said that I absolutely lost it. But also something just clicked. Like, in a ""What the fuck. He would be lucky to be able to spend the rest of his life with me. It's not some sort of fucking obligation but he clearly feels like it is and I'm not gonna be married to a man who acts like his wife that *he* asked to marry is some ball and chain"" way. I got my things at his place and left. I haven't spoken to him since.

The process of cancelling the wedding 10 days before was exhausting and embarrassing. I told my friends and family what happened, and simply told his friends and family that we weren't going forward with it. Since, my ex-fiance has not left me alone. He has been showing up at my apartment at night, incessantly calling me, messaging my sister, my mom, my brothers. Looking up my friends and begging them to pass a message on to me, hanging out at places I usually do to try to see me. I blocked his number and all of his social media, but he still emails me and I haven't figured out how to block him on there. Most of his emails are him pathetically begging for me back, telling me how lost and heartbroken he is, how he'll never move on. Some of them beg for closure. It's just....a lot. It's gotten to a point where my mom thinks I should file a restraining order because she fears for my safety. I don't, but I just want him to leave me alone.

A little part of me feels bad for basically ghosting him and like it wasn't deserved. I spent 4 years of my life with him and thought I would spend the rest of my life with him. But I've spent the last few months trying to move on and I can't do that if he won't let me be. I don't want to have to contact him ever again, but I feel like a short email telling him to leave me alone would be better than going straight to a restraining order. Any advice is appreciated.

tldr; Fiance cheated during bachelor party, I confronted him, canceled the wedding, and haven't spoken to him since. He won't stop basically stalking me."
"I[32F] feel like my husband[33M] is in denial about his feelings towards me. Married 11 years with 2 special needs kids, I got fat and dead bedroom... How can I fix things with him?


If you saw this yesterday I apologize it was taken down because I somehow fat fingered something to look like a link thu breaking a rule, and while I had great responses I was unable to reply etc.  


  
TL;DR: 2 special needs kids. SAHM to basically be able to do all the therapies and appointments. Am huge now. Husband never has sex with me but swears he loves me and is attracted to me. Works late and very little interaction. Feel like he's with me not to be the asshole who leaves his wife with 2 special needs kids. \*\*How can i fix this mess?\*\*

We've been married 11 years. High school sweethearts...well started dating right after high school. Not each other's first boyfriend/girlfriend but I've only had sex with him.

Jack and I have been married for 11 years. We have two kids. Both of our kids had special needs with our oldest being extremely high functioning and gifted and our younger child being in the moderate category for autism. Our youngest is 4.

Jack is a very successful person and while I had a promising career when our oldest child had issues we decided since I made less and had better medical background I would stay home. He was happy to do this as his own mom stayed home but it was hard for me as I always saw myself working and being successful. I'm being vague because he does read this sub. I took our oldest to all therapies and was an aide in preschool for him. Honestly without driving it was over a part time job and some years over a full time job.

My life became all about pushing this child uphill and itworked Now you would never know he had severe challenges. He still gets social therapy and needs anxiety help but really he just seems like a super smart child,

We were both still very much in love and decided to have our second child. This was before we knew our older one had aspbergers. Our oldest was diagnosed when our younger child was mere months old. With a newborn I still did all of the therapy, driving and preschool stuff with my older. Around age 2.5 it became apparent while our younger child was hitting milestones he regressed. He is one of the small percentage of children who regress after the age of two. I admit this fucked with me bad and I was suicidal. I was put on medication and am dealing well with it but I felt like my child was stolen. to go from fully verbal and conversational to mute and right when his brother was graduating all his therapies save social skills therapy was a huge mind fuck. I was gutted. I began putting on more weight and my eating for comfort got out of control. I'm now trying I sti to accept where our youngest is and take happiness in what strides he is making. l take on childcare and therapies. I'm never home long enough to clean and organize it and when I am I'm usually so beat and tired to organize the toys they dump etc. Forget spring cleaning it never happens. My husband was always messy so it just adds to it being a shithole of clutter(not filth the trash is taken out and dishes done but messy clutter and unwashed walls with kid prints on it). I feel I never get a break. He is worse off than his brother in many ways but he is also the happiest kid.

When we got married I was 130lbs and 5'8. Looking back I think I was extremely attractive but had poor self esteem as I was not American ideals and was bullied a lot for my ""ethnic looks"". After our first was born I struggled to lose weight but I did. After our second I was losing weight until my oldest was diagnosed with aspbergers. I then comfort ate. Currently I am 260lbs. The heaviest I have ever been. I'm on depression medication. Our house is a mess, I'm always stressed out and just exhausted. Jack has always been overweight but it never bothered me. I'm talking around 220 most of his adult life and he is 5'9. He is now 245. He does have some health stuff but it's minor and not severe. His professional life is super bright but due to our children's needs you wouldn't tell how well he is doing for himself.

My birthday he ""forgot"" because I was depressed and did not want to go out due to my younger child being kicked out of a preschool so we didn't even cut a store bought cake. Mother's day I got a beautiful heartfelt card saying I was a good mother and chocolates. His birthday came around and he got himself something expensive and nice and I also got him a nice gift and card. I planned a surprise party for him. I'm trying to have the kids make him a father's day gift. I make sure every day to tell him how much I adore him and love him.

I feel unloved. We never have sex anymore. The kids reject him because he barely interacts-if I am honest he may have aspbergers himself- so I am putting them to bed. I ask him and he says he's tired or work or whatever else excuse. Today he turned down a bj. Not even a bodily response when I was trying to initiate it. He says it's just the kids, stress, work, exhaustion, his back hurts literally everything.

He swears he loves me and is attracted to me still but the lack of sex unless I literally beg him bothers me. He jacks off so I know it's not a testosterone thing. I've offered counseling and he says he loves me and doesn't know where it is coming from. I'm starting to feel like we're married because I am a SAHM and can bring our special needs kid to 100000 appointments and he worries if we divorce who would do it not to mention he probably would feel bad if he left me because our kids.

I love him so much but either he is in denial or I am crazy. I want to stay married to him. I don't think I could ever love someone the way I love him but I don't think he loves me anymore- and again he swears he does. I just don't get how we would have sex every day then every other day after our first was born then three times a week after our second was born to now I'm lucky if I get it twice a month and I have to harass him for it. He doesn't initiate it. It kills me because I just feel ugly. I also suspect he is upset the house went to hell but I feel like I can't keep up both my kids are in therapies granted my oldest who is gifted is just in a private social group but still I never have a break.

He works until 8pm most weekdays and I feel it may be a choice. When he gets home he's on his computer or takes hours on the bathroom where he hides from us. When he is home he seems irritated with everything. We do date nights a few times a month but it's either silent or me filling conversation. I'm so lost and I don't know where to start. When I ask him what I need to do or how I can fix this he reassures me he loves me and is just tired and nothing is broken.

I was raised by a single mom so I really don't know what to do here and if I am being crazy. I'm too ashamed to ask my female friends because they joke their husbands bug them for sex too much and they are tired. Is it normal to have a super dead bedroom for over a year in long relationships? I just want to fix this. I love him."
"I [22m] am pretty sure my wife's [20f] new friend [25ishf] is a pathological liar, but my wife eats up everything this lady says and it's getting on my nerves.


My wife and I have been together for five years, we got married about nine months ago. I'm in the Army and we live on an Army post, so we're kind of used to seeing friends come and go kind of quickly.

My wife (Erin) is an amazingly sweet woman, but maybe a a little naive sometimes. It hasn't really caused an issue until now.

A new couple moved in next door a few weeks ago. I've kinda palled with the husband, but he and I don't really have much in common so we don't really interact much beyond casual greetings and chatting in the driveway.

But the wife and Erin really hit it off. Erin has been a bit lonely so she was excited for a new friend to move in.

I met the lady one night and alot of the stuff she said instantly stuck out to me as a lie.

She told us she had been in the Army herself before. I asked her a few casual questions just trying to make conversation, and she mentioned that she was ""forced"" to join. I asked what she meant and she claimed she got in trouble with the and the judge ordered her to join the military in lieu of jail. I didn't say anything right then soas to not spoil the night, but I knew that was a lie.

On the way back home Erin was remarking on how crazy it was this lady was forced into the service. I just said that she was bullshitting because no one has been sentenced to military service by a judge since Vietnam. Erin thought about it for a second and then said ""Well, maybe she had a unique situation"" and I still just told her no, no one has that unique of a situation.

I kind of avoided the lady after that since it rubbed me the wrong way, but she's still found ways to get on my nerves, through my wife.

Like a few days after the above Erin had a fever and a cough. I took her to the doc, she had a little respitory infection and the doc gave her some antibiotics and sent her home. Then the next day at work I get a call from her, freaking out because our neighbor told her she was showing signs of tuberculosis. I asked her if the neighbor was the one who told her that and Erin told me ""Yes, she's seen it before."" 

Maybe not the best response but I told Erin I think her friend is full of it and she'd be fine with the antibiotics. Spoiler alert, after another hospital visit to be sure, she was fine.

Erin told me the other day that the neighbor is a diagnosed psychopath. I just raised an eyebrow and Erin said ""No, like she's actually diagnosed"". And I asked if that was according to the neighbor. She said yes and I reiterated that I think the neighbor is full of shit and is the type of person to think being a psychopath is cool so she brags about a ""diagnosis"".

Erin seemed a little hurt or embarrassed by what I said, and I felt bad for that, but I also felt like it needed to be said.

The final straw was the other day. Erin's car was having some trouble. I'm an Army mechanic, and I've worked on my own car since I was 16. I very quickly figured out she just needed a new battery and I promised her I would get her one after work the next day. The next day I get home and discover Erin bought a whole new fucking alternator. I asked her why in the hell she spent the money on this when I already told her it was the battery. Erin told me the neighbor came over to look at the car and decided it was the alternator.

I asked Erin why, in the hell, she would believe this lying woman over me, who goes to work and does this exact thing every single day. Erin told me that I'm an Army mechanic, but lying-neighbor totally used to be a civilian mechanic and would know civilian cars better.

I admit I lost my temper a bit and told her I was sick of hearing about lying neighbor. Again, I think I hurt Erin's feelings a little and I feel bad for that but...
come the fuck on!

I've left it alone since then, but I am *sick* of our lying neighbor and my wife taking her word over my advice on things!

I know Erin is lonely when I'm gone and I don't want to be a jerk about her friends, but this friend is pretty toxic.

What is the right thing to do? I'm not some jerk that wants to tell my wife who she can hang with, but I might punch this lady if she and her lies keep interfering in my life. Help?

**TL;DR**: Wife made friends with a pathological liar next door, and eats up all her lies. It's driving me insane and I don't know what to do!"
"My [28F] entire in-laws family [18-80M/F] of very British, picky eaters are visiting Korea for our wedding


My fiancé \[30M\] and I \[28F\] are getting married in Korea this summer, and his entire family is traveling over for the event. This includes his parents, grandfather, cousins, aunts and uncles. For many of them, this will be their first time flying overseas and leaving Europe. 

&amp;#x200B;

One of the reasons I love my fiancé is his open-mindedness and willingness to try new things, but that doesn't extend to his family - especially when it comes to food. (Basically for everything else, his family has been extremely supportive and welcoming, they are just very set in their ways when it comes to food). 

&amp;#x200B;

To describe my MIL's cooking style, it is extremely old-school British. She boils all of her vegetables until they are able to be cut with a spoon, does not use any spices or salt during cooking, and refuses to eat meat that is less than well done. They also do not use garlic or onion in their cooking because it is deemed too spicy. 

&amp;#x200B;

The rest of my fiancé's family is just as picky when it comes to food. His grandfather was very apprehensive to try some crisps I bought because they were 'Salt and Black Pepper' flavour since that was too exotic. The only vegetables his cousins will eat are peas and carrots. I think this gives you a good picture of what type of foods they are comfortable with eating. 

&amp;#x200B;

I've cooked for their family multiple times, but I've only ever cooked British style food for them, knowing their taste preferences. The only time I tried to make something different was when I made duck, and a lot of them refused to even try it, and the ones that did REALLY didn't like it. If you are familiar with any sort of Korean cooking you'll know that it is chock full of red pepper paste, garlic, and seaweed - all things they would refuse to even have a bite of. 

&amp;#x200B;

The major issue is that I feel like this is going to spoil their trip to Korea. They are going to be visiting for 2-3 weeks, so they won't be able to solely eat what little western food is available. Even what I consider extremely safe options (Korean fried chicken, Isaac toast) is too different for their palates. I also don't want to spend my wedding worrying about them and if they're going to collapse from hunger. 

&amp;#x200B;

Please let me know what I should do about this! Would it be tactful to ask them to pack some foods to bring with them, etc?

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR: My extremely British, plain-eating in-laws family are traveling to Korea to visit and I'm worried that they will not be able to eat anything!"
"Friend (40sF) seems obsessed with me because of my past (29F) .. should I just ghost her or actually say something?


Some background on me: when I was a child, I was kidnapped by a non-relative. It was a big deal at the time but I never had long-lasting effects from it and I've grown up pretty normal. My family was supportive and I had good friends around me the whole time. It feels kind of like someone telling a ""I broke my leg in 3rd grade"" story. Yes, it happened, but really, it means nothing to me. Unfortunately, there are some articles about it online, my name, my school picture, and things like that. My name is somewhat common though so it's not widely known.

Anyway, someone friended me on Instagram and we bonded over cat pictures. I have a kind of ""rare"" type of cat and she does too. She asked one day if I'd like to meet up for coffee. I said yes because why not? She seemed super chill and loves cats. And in person, she seemed very sweet but maybe kind of sheltered and nervous. We continued to keep up a friendship, occasionally meeting for brunch and coffee. Then one day she drops the bomb on me - are you ""ABC Smith"" that was in the news 20 years ago? I figured she must have Googled me for whatever reason. Since the day I said ""yes, that's me"" she has been relentlessly hounding me about this part of my life. We don't talk about cats anymore, we just don't talk about anything else at all. She says it's because she's curious because she has never met someone like me before; because she has always had a morbid curiosity about serial killers, kidnappings, etc. At first, I was honest with her but at a certain point, I felt uncomfortable and tried to steer the conversation away.

Out of my own curiosity, I looked myself up and found a bunch of things on one particular website. Most of it was just typical case details, but there was a poster on there who claimed to be a close friend - and the shit she wrote on there was mostly lies and exaggerations. I can't be 100% sure this is her but I am about 90% sure. She would write things about how ""ABC has learned to move on with her life"" (who the hell was even asking??) and hinting at the graphic details she knows, but can't speak of. And the worst part is that she had been posting about this about 6 months before we actually ever even met. 

I told my boyfriend about this and he immediately told me to shut it down - tell her off, block her, threaten to sue, whatever it takes to just get her out of my life. I have not told my parents or close family friends because I don't want to upset them. I feel betrayed and creeped out but I'm not devastated or anything. I just don't feel anything. She is nothing to me. I don't feel like using any of my energy to talk to her again, even to tell her off, but my boyfriend says it is worth it to at least say something.

Should I just ghost her and forget about her? Or is it better to scare some sense into her and tell her to stop writing about me? It's not like what she is doing is illegal... and to be honest, besides the handful of people online looking me up, I doubt anyone cares. What should I do?

TLDR: Friend I met from Instagram turns out to be someone who stalked me online to find me and my history. I am creeped out but don't want to waste any more of my time with this crazy B... boyfriend says I need to tell her off properly so she stops. What should I do?"
"My (26F) undergraduate research assistant (22F) plagarized my research poster for her own poster and I don't know if I should just let it go.


I've been mentoring my undergrad, Anna, for over 2 years now. She joined my lab when she was a sophomore, and now she's a senior, graduating college in June. We're at a large research university in the U.S., I'm a Ph.D. student in my 4th year, and I have been directly responsible for mentoring Anna. 

**Important context for how to judge this, but not part of the situation:** Anna and I are are fairly close, and I have always been very understanding of her busyness. She's one of those ""machine"" college students that does it all - extremely high GPA (like 3.9+) in an extremely difficult science-related, and she's the type to study all night to ace tests left and right, go to the gym, while also partying, going to Coachella, and traveling every 3-day holiday weekend. She's never gone out of her way to do anything or be super inquisitive in the lab, and has not put in a lot of consistent hours in the lab, but is great at doing what she's told to do, and has contributed to my work. She wants to go to med school (she already did well on her MCAT) and she is working in the lab to get a letter of rec from our PI (principal investigator, aka the professor who runs the lab), who's pretty respected in our field. For additional context, our PI, Adam, thinks that while Anna is a smart student who is helpful, he does recognize how she's not the best undergrad we've had, in terms of her passion/commitment/dedication.

**Situation:** Her senior research poster session is coming up next week, and she's to present a poster about her project. Her project is a small branch off of my project, which we'll say is about vapes. I sent her the poster that I made for a recent conference about vapes. I knew that because she was super busy and had a ton of finals and also had never made a poster before, it would be helpful and ensure she finishes her poster on time if she had my vape poster to refer to when she made her own poster. My mentors have sent me PDFs of their past posters and powerpoint presentations too, to help me figure out how to make my own stuff from scratch in the past. So, the act of me sending her my vape poster to refer to, isn't necessarily out of the ordinary for my field, or something that mentors generally don't do.

She sent me a draft of her poster on Thursday night, and the Introduction, Background, Materials and Methods, some of the Results, the Conclusion, some of the Discussion, and Acknowledgements for word-for-word copied from my poster. Her new data was in the poster as well, with a few of her own sentences that drew conclusions from the data. But, I'd say 80-90% of the words on the poster were directly transcribed (no pun intended) from my vape poster. 

I sent her a text saying something along the lines of **""I just looked at your poster. It's really similar to mine in that most of it looks like it's just copied and pasted word for word, which makes me feel uncomfortable and regretful that I sent you my poster as a reference. Can you change it up so it's more of your own poster and your own ideas?""** to that, she responded, **""Oh my apologies. I'll change it right now. I really didn't intend on it, I've just never made a poster before and used yours as a guide and didn't even realize how similar they were. I will fix it now!""** She then sent me a poster that is completely reworded, so technically it's not copy-and-paste anymore, but it's still just my ideas, reworded, with no change in overall structure.

The next day, I confronted her in the lab in a private place, and asked her to talk with me through it in person. I asked her what her mindset was when she went into it. She said that she first copied and pasted my stuff, and then intended on rewording it so it's not the exact same, but she sent me the wrong copy before she had reworded it. I told her that it's still not the right way to make a poster and that she should have made it all from scratch, and that my vape poster was supposed to be just inspiration and guidance, even if our topics were the same - that she shouldn't have copied my poster word for word to begin with. She's an extremely clever and smart girl, so she said all the right things, like **""I'm such an idiot"", ""I'll do whatever it takes to make it up to you"", etc. She also texted me that night apologizing, ""I didn't know what I was thinking"", ""Our relationship means a lot to me and I look up to you a lot"", ""I'm sorry I disappointed you"", ""I know there really isn't anything I could do to make up for it but please let me know"", ""I appreciate you having an open conversation with me to try to understand my side even though I am in the wrong"".** 

The poster session is this upcoming Tuesday, and with the Holiday weekend in America, she HAD to submit her poster to a printing shop on Thursday to have it on time for the session on Tuesday. Even though I had planned with her to finish experiments 2 weeks before the poster was due so she had plenty of time to make her poster, and we had gone over this schedule 2-3 times during the quarter, she still delayed her experiments and finally got around to making the poster over a couple of days. I would have definitely made her remake the poster more, if we had more time.

My question is, should I just accept her apologies and let it go? Or do I bring this up with Adam? Or will that just make ME look like a petty grad student who didn't mentor their student well enough/not set boundaries enough? Adam is pretty hands-off, but he does care a lot. This could easily be something that makes it so his letter of recommendation for Anna's medical school applications is not as good. I feel like he'd want to know, but at the same time I don't know if I need to burden him with it. Anna is extremely smart - there is no way she didn't realize it was the same exact sentences. In my gut, I think that she thought she could get away with it and I'd let it slide. Also her logic changes from ""I didn't really intend on it/didn't realize how similar they were"" to ""I was planning on rewording it"". I feel like I have also let myself down and think I could have been a better mentor. Thanks for your thoughtful insight, everyone.

**TL;DR:** My undergraduate assistant plagarized my poster contents for her poster, which she is to present this upcoming Tuesday. When I pointed it out, she reworded it so it's not the same words as mine, although the content of the poster is still 80% identical. I don't know if I need to make my boss aware of this, or to just let it go and accept her apologies."
"Together 30 years, no marriage, starting to regret it [49F, 51M]


I have been with my boyfriend since I was 19 and he was 21. Deeply in love, sexually compatible, musicians, travel the world together, the whole shebang. However, we never got married. Neither of us cared much about it to be honest. We knew we were in love and that we would always be together, so what's the point of marriage? Well, I've been reflecting on our relationship recently. We might be moving to Europe with his father. His mother is deceased and his father is ill and would like to pass in his native country. This has made me think about our own mortality. If he passes, I won't be his widow. Not legally. We own stuff together, i.e. our house. So the legality there worries me. We don't have kids, so we're fine in that department. I think the social aspect is what really bothers me.

I am still the ""girlfriend"" but I'm not. I feel I am more than that but I'm technically still that. I would be the girlfriend of the deceased. Not the wife, not the widow. Just the girlfriend. And he's just my boyfriend. I really don't like calling him that because he is more than that. I call him my husband but it's a lie. I use his last name for certain things but I don't really a (legal) right to. Our friends and family know we aren't married but treat us like we are. So it's not a big deal to them, but for strangers, I just lie to them. Mainly, now that I am older. I wouldn't hesitate to say he was my boyfriend when I was young. But I guess it seems wrong now to say that because of our ages. I can't help but think they are judging me for still having a boyfriend at this age instead of a husband.

On legal forms, I have to put single even though I'm not. Sometimes they give you the option of 'other' and that feels better, but I wish there was a category for couples like us. 

I am comfortable with my relationship. I don't need marriage but I want my relationship to be formally recognized. I want that ""stamp of approval"" so to speak. I'm not sure what I'm asking here. I just want some kind of advice. An outside perspective.

TL;DR Been together 30 years, mutually decided not to marry, have mixed feelings"
"I (56m) need to tell my Son (m 31) and my daughter-in-law (f 26) who want to start a family, that our family history of schizophrenia is much stronger than they know. Looking for advice on how to break this to him/them.


I'm on mobile so please forgive me.

Some relevant history. 

My sister (f 59) why I love dearly, developed schizophrenia when she was 18 and she has a chronic case of it. After many years we finally found a prescription regimen that works for her, although she's stable and has been for years, she's unable to live independently and she exhibits the classic behaviors of someone with a severe case of the disease. Also, the side affects of the medication are significant and she's unable to work or maintain friendships. This is important because my son and his sister grew up living just a few blocks from my mother who lived and took care of my sister for 35 years before my mother died a few years ago. So, my kids have seen firsthand what the disease can be like.

A four years ago his younger sister (f24) developed the disease too. She had to drop out of college and was unable to work. After two years of therapy she's been able to obtain and maintain a job and she's doing well, though it's turned her life upside down.

A few months before my mother died (two years ago) she gave me more of my family history. Prior to this conversation I and my kids knew of an Aunt (she's fully functional when taking her medication) on my father's side and my paternal grandmother (was never medicated and although she struggled she was able to raise a family and be wife and mother) who had the disease bringing the total cases to four people including my daughter and sister with schizophrenia. My mother went on to list four more people on my father's side and two on HER side with schizophrenia that she knew of. Schizophrenia has a strong hereditary component for those of you who unfamiliar with the disease.

I feel my Son and my daughter-in-law should know this history so they can make an informed decision before they start a family. 

I would like to talk to my son one on one about this so he can process all of this first, but that leaves him with the heavy burden of trying to find a way to tell his wife. If I sit them down together, it's kind of blindsiding him, but I would be there to answer questions and provide support to both of them.

How do I break this news to them? Should I bring up sperm donation or adoption?

Tl;Dr. I have a stronger family history of schizophrenia than my Son and his wife know and I'm looking for advice on how to break this news to them before they have their own biological children."
"Is it a mistake to leave a perfectly good 6 year relationship because he doesn't want to get married yet?


I [24F] have been with my boyfriend [25M] for over 6 years now. We graduated, have lived together for 5 years, and have stable careers (I'm a nurse, he's an engineer). I feel like it's the right time to get married. I've talked about this extensively with him, he knows my wishes.

The problem is my schizophrenia. We went to hell and back when I was diagnosed. He always took good care of me and he's the reason why I'm in total remission (and have been for 2 years!) I have worked SO hard. I take all my medication, go to group and individual therapy, and do yoga to keep me grounded. I am no longer dependent on him for care, which he said is what he wanted before we got married. **I understand why he wouldn't want to get married while I was still struggling with this. But that's not the case anymore.* 

I sat down with him a few weeks ago to put all the cards on the table. I'm ready to get married. I want to be married for several years before I have kids. He told me that he didn't want to marry me because I'm schizophrenic and essentially said he would leave me if I relapsed.

I just wish he wanted to marry me and was excited about the prospect of spending our lives together. He has done so, so much for me. I couldn't have gotten through school or my mental health issues without him. But I feel myself growing distant since this talk. I have always been 100% sure that he is the one, and that we have a great relationship, and that he saw us together forever. Just the fact that he has considered situations in which he would break up with me (barring cheating, or something like that) makes my heart shatter. I've always been so sure about him, I just now realized he's not sure about me.

I would never cheat on him, but I have been getting attention from one of my male coworkers and while I am not romantically interested in him, it kind of stirred the idea in my head that someone else might be able to commit to me, despite my problems. 

Sometimes my boyfriend says things like ""no one else would have stayed with you"" and ""I don't know why I even help you"". These words cut me like a knife. I've said my share of hurtful things, but that was in the distant past before I got medicated and I have been working hard to keep it that way, while he just says these hurtful things all the time. 

Is this relationship worth salvaging? I want someone to be happy to be with me, someone who isn't ashamed of me. I feel like that joy of someone being proud of you has been robbed from me if i stay with him. I know it will hurt so much if we break up, so I'm not sure how I'll deal with that. He's been my life for over 6 years now, and I'm just so confused.

What should I do?

**tl;dr** I've been with my boyfriend for 6 years and wondering if I should stay with him because he doesn't want to get married while I do"
"I (45m) slipped up and revealed something my gf (40) asked me not to tell people. How do I make things right?


So, today I fucked up.



My gf has been keeping details of something from everyone we know - the death of a relative - because she doesn't want to talk about it. Today, I was talking to her friend and accidentally let slip about it (she asked directly about how the relative was doing and I forgot I wasn't supposed to tell anyone).



I realised my mistake and told the friend the truth, that my gf has been to upset to discuss it. 



Told my gf about my mistake and she is devastated because friend will know she lied to her. Tells me that she can't believe I have done it, that I have let her down terribly. That I have betrayed her. She's not speaking to me, not answering my calls or texts. I am buying flowers on way home but know she will give me silent treatment for days now. Any ideas on what I can say other than sorry? It was a genuine accident, my gf had told me months ago that she wasn't telling her friends but I completely forgot about it in the meantime...


Tl/dr - accidentally revealed something my gf didn't want people to know. She is devastated. How do I make amends?"
"[UPDATE] Bf (21M) told me (22F) yesterday that I should go out, which was followed by ""so that I can feel like i'm dating someone who actually has a life"". **After days of me being upset, he CHEATED on me**


After making the original post, a series of things happened that caused me to be upset; I think all the comments brought to light how abusive he was, so I started standing up for myself and opened up about the many things that were wrong. [Original post here](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/bqbdkl/bf_21m_told_me_22f_yesterday_that_i_should_go_out/)   


Backstory: shortly after making the post, since he kept expressing things for the last few months that made me feel like he wants to be single (e.g. he goes on about wanting to solo-travel, he wants to go out and meet new people and complains that I don't offer him that social lifestyle; and then he brought up wanting to move overseas) I got the courage to tell him it makes me concerned that he has spoken about moving overseas (or travelling) but never included me in the vision, he raised his voice and said ""well, if I move overseas then who cares we'll just break up"". Obviously, it sounds like he wants to be single. I know in my heart that if you love someone you see them in these futuristic ideas so I backfired and told him that. He immediately took it back and said ""okay, you took it the wrong way, I meant that it's the worst that could happen"".   


Anyway, after that argument I got distant and felt hurt that someone who I've been seeing for about 3 years is not interested enough in me to be able to visualise me doing amazing things with them. **So, he came home after work (it was a Friday night) and I said ""you know what, you sound like you want to be single so f\*ck off and go be single""**; he knew I was upset and feeling resentful. So, he went out at about 6pm and didn't come home that night. He called me midday and wanted to get lunch with me, so I texted him everything expressing why I was still upset; for those of you that want the goss this is the exact text (can skip if cba doesn't add much to the story):  


*""It's funny that you say something so strongly like ""if I move then we're breaking up who cares"" and then expect me to be able to forget it. Your plans and comments all sound like you want to be single, you want to go solo travelling, you want to meet new people and openly complain about how i don't offer you that, you want to move overseas but never thought of me in that vision. Those are straight red flags in any relationship, it doesn't come down to me being concerned bc of ""not having a life"" and me ""not being confident"" like you would hope to put it to. You've fucked up my head by making me believe if i was just more this n that then maybe I'd be able to come. You could of just left it at a strong fuck yea i want you to come, or no I really need to do this by myself, but you never did, and instead you had to try convince me why i wasn't good enough when deep down you knew you wanted to go alone. I told you weeks ago to stop making me feel like i'm inadequate and that was well before this bullshit travelling topic came up.""*  


Anywho, he replied that he feels like his life is really boring and that many of his friends are moving overseas so he feels ""sh\*t scared out of being bored"". **He said he has been projecting that frustration towards me (which so many of the comments on the original post pointed out!! Well done).** He said he'd hate for me to change, and that he does really love me and that he is sorry.   


So, I ended up meeting up with him that day to see what else he had to say.. we hung out most of the day, **and then he told me that he slept with someone else**, he was crying and said that he took my ""you know what, you sound like you want to be single so f\*ck off and go be single"" seriously and genuinely thought I was breaking up with him. He said to me ""the person I loved was out the door, and so I drunk heavily and ended up going back to a girl's house and ended up having sex with her when I was blackout drunk"". He also said he was sick of how things were going in our relationship, and all he wants is for both of us to be happy.  


So, despite him finally admitting that he has been in the wrong with the way he has been treating me, he has now cheated on me and brought about a whole new level of issues to the relationship. Now I'm incredibly confused, I don't know what I want. All of the initial issues sound resolved, but now I have to deal with the fact he has toyed with my trust, is his behaviour here acceptable given that I loosely said go be single?  


TL;DR: After an ongiong argument to do with him not seeing me as good enough and sounding like he wants a life without me, I told him out of resentfulness ""you know what, you sound like you want to be single so f\*ck off and go be single"" and he did just that and had ""blackout drunk sex"" with another girl. Is this acceptable given that our initial issues appear to be resolved?"
"My (29F) husband (29M) cut my wedding ring in half and left it on my nightstand this am.


There is so much background, like with all relationships, that I could write a novel. I will however, try and be brief. I have never posted before, and I’m on mobile so please excuse formatting and all that. 

My husband and I have had a rocky last couple of months, this is more than likely due to the addition of our baby boy, born just 10 weeks ago. My husband has not been adjusting well, and I am tired of making excuses for him. The gist of it is he seems to miss being single. He constantly complains about wanting to go camping and out (which I am fine with to a point). However he thinks that going camping most weekends of the month as well as to out of town weddings by himself and just not helping me in general with baby is totally acceptable behavior. 

Nearly everyday he complains nonstop about projects at home (that he is choosing to do) and the weather and being tired. My sympathy has waned. He has had many nights to himself while I stay with my parents for a night with LO, he sleeps in every weekend and has never gotten up in the night with baby. 

Last night he was going on another tangent and after about an hour of trying to comfort him, I just decided to go to bed. He went to bed too and was openly sobbing upset (he doesn’t comfort me when I am upset or crying) and again after about twenty minutes I gave up and rolled over to go to bed. He preceded to throw a toddler level fit and my patience was gone. I knew I would be getting up in about an hour with baby, and needed what little sleep I could get. 

He finally goes to another room, but not without throwing stuff on the floor and making a huge mess for me to clean up (he doesn’t help with housework, but he does do a ton of projects around the house and cooks a lot). He wakes up with the baby and instead of helping (we bottle feed at night) he gets me up. As frustrated as I was I got baby back down and in the morning I got on the couch with him and rubbed his back told him I loved him and I was sorry he was stressed. After a few minutes of complaining he turned it on me. He said I had to stay at my parents house when he finished a project. I stated he could stay there too and he freaked out. Stating that he was stressed having to take care of me. I pointed out that I take care of myself and he gave me the silent treatment. He does this constantly. I got annoyed and called my mom and complained. 

He never said another word to me, but I found my wedding ring (rubber ring worn by many healthcare workers) cut in half on my night stand. He left for work without saying bye to me or our son. 

I am packing enough stuff for a couple days away. I am contemplating not even telling him, but I do have our son with me. I don’t even know if this relationship is worth it, or salvageable. This is the icing on the cake and although I’ve said I’m going to leave before, I am actually doing it today. I have no idea how to navigate this or what to do next."
"[UPDATE] My (19F) mother (52F) is opening my mail without my permission.


Previous Post: https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/bsqugk/my_19f_mother_52f_is_opening_my_mail_without_my/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share

Hey everyone, I meant to post this yesterday but I ended up being way too busy. I confronted my mom about opening my mail, and she agreed to stop. There was no fuss, no argument, the conversation pretty much just went ""Hey mom? Can you stop opening my mail? It makes me uncomfortable."" ""Oh, okay."" She didn't really ask for an explanation so I didn't get to explain my reasoning, but I'm fine with the outcome. She also explained why she opened the letter that had my debit card in it. We use the same bank (but have separate accounts) so when she saw the bank's logo on the envelope, she assumed it was for her. Her explanation seems believable enough to me, especially since nothing in my account was altered and the card wasn't activated when I got it.
Anyways, thanks for the feedback on the original post! I really appreciated it and it probably helped prevent any kind of arguement.

TL:DR: Mom said she'd stop opening my mail, and she opened the letter from my bank by mistake."
"My (25M) girlfriend (23F) posted a photo of her and an ex-partner during our relationship, I don't know what to think.


So basically, I'm with this great girl and we have been seeing each other for about 6 months, everything is awesome.

&amp;#x200B;

Side note, she is very much active with social media in specific instagram.

&amp;#x200B;

2 weeks into our relationship, she posted a photo on her private instagram account with about 150 followers a photo of her sitting on the lap of an extremely well known internet-comedian, someone I knew she had a fling with before we started dating. Obviously this photo was taken sometime before or after they had sex.

&amp;#x200B;

The comments included a bunch of friends freaking out over the image as he's obviously a fairly famous figure right now. Including one that asked if they had sex, my girlfriends response wasn't a direct answer to the question but it alluded to yes.

&amp;#x200B;

At the time I didn't think too much of it, after a few days I became hurt by it and she saw that it was a dumb mistake and said she wanted friends to know about it, as a 'claim' I guess. She deleted it soon after.

&amp;#x200B;

I don't think about it much, but every time I go on youtube I'm bound to see him pop up somewhere and it just reminds me of the whole incident, and how much it hurts me.

&amp;#x200B;

I don't know how to feel and I just want to know what you guys think about it.

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR: Early into our relationship, girlfriend posted a photo of her and a famous guy she had sex with on her private instagram. Don't know how to feel."
"My [26m] girlfriend [27f] of 4 months frequently sucks her thumb and I find it very unpleasant. Should I say something?


She sucks her thumb absently most days, while using her phone, watching TV, reading, etc. It's kind of her version of fidgeting I guess? 

Anyway I don't like it. At first I thought it was kind of a weird detail but didn't mind, but now I find it very unpleasant.

She sometimes gets a little bit more ""into it"" than usual and makes small noises that I find a little disgusting, and sometimes her thumb is totally covered in saliva after. She does it in public sometimes, too. Not in a flamboyantly visible or loud way, but still.

Outside of this bizarre detail I am satisfied with her and the relationship.

Is it reasonable of me to want her to stop, at least in public or around me in private, if possible? Is it just a weird little detail or has it got some sort of deeper meaning?

**tl;dr:** GF sucks her thumb in private and public. Is it reasonable of me to want her to stop? Should I tell her?"
"My [17M] Coworker’s [40sF] daughter [14F] has a very bad crush on me and gets in the way of my work. Rumors got started about us and my boss took me to a 1 on 1 lunch to discuss it. I’m not sure how to proceed.


I work as a maintenance worker for an office building in a large city, my job is to work on the 8th floor. Her mom is a prominent person on the 8th floor and regularly brings her daughter with her. She usually doesn’t have anything to do and does things to kill time. She’s always hanging around me, asking if she can help, asking me personal questions, and pretending not to understand simple stuff so that I can “explain it to her”. Sometimes she follows me around, always fixing her hair and smiling at me in a way that clearly shows how she feels. She likes to show herself off and she’s been somewhat flirty at times, and it sometimes is over the top.

Things have gotten to the point that the head of maintenance took me to lunch so we could discuss “your relationship with her”. Turns out that the office rumor mill (what a horrible thing that is) got churning with stories about us and it became a building gossip discussion. She’s kinda cute, but she’s 3 years younger so I haven’t even considered her as a romantic option, and I don’t consider her a good match for me anyways. She’s a little too urban for me. I told him that it’s all her doing and I haven’t done anything to egg her on, and that we aren’t in a romantic relationship. At first he seemed doubtful, but eventually he understood, which is a good thing because I could have gotten in deep trouble had I not talked my way out of that.

I don’t want to ruin her dream, and I want to be very careful with the situation considering that her mother is in a higher position and she’s a family friend. I feel really bad for the girl and I’ve been hoping she would move on to someone else but she hasn’t stopped. Considering she’s never confessed to me I feel it would be even more awkward to call that out to her. I’m not sure what to do now because if I tell her or her mom it could get awkward for us, my job, and maybe my family.

TL;DR My coworker’s daughter (who is younger than me, and not a good match) has a raging crush on me and won’t admit it, and this causes problems for me in the workplace."
"Me [26 M] with my wife [25 F] 5 years, we found out she can't have kids 4 months ago and our relationship has changed very drastically.


So me and my wife have been together for a few years now and honestly I don't know what I would without her. We've been through a lot in our marriage from family deaths to health issues but we were always able to get past those hardships.

Now I'm not sure what to do because she seems to be completely broken by this. It's turned her into an entirely different person than who she was before, she's very clingy and has to be by my side almost 24/7 now and when she's not she texting me every 30 minutes.

She has moments where she just cries non-stop but I do my best to try and comfort her. It's weird because before she was her own person, she would give her opinion on everyday things and you she was normal?

Now she just agrees with whatever I say and it's honestly frustrating, she was never like this and whenever I ask her why she's being like this she just says it's because she loves me.

I'm not trying to get gross here but sexually she stopped having me do things that pleased her and has focused so much on what makes me feel good that it's had the opposite effect if that makes sense?

I'm just not sure what to do here because I've never had a situation like this before so I'm just not sure where to begin.

TL;DR: we found my wife can't have kids and now she has changed into what feels like a submissive person. Not sure what to do."
"[UPDATE] my(f25) friend(m25) is abused by his fiance(f21)


[Link to original post.](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/azjvky/myf25_friend_m25_is_abused_by_his_fiancéf21_want/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share)

My original post didn't get much attention but I still wanted to update you guys on what has happened since.

I (f25) thought a lot about what I should do after reading the replies I got and decided to wait a little since I know he's been trying to get rid of her. After a few weeks I called a friend of mine, Nina(f23) who was working with Daisy ( f21 the abusive fiance) and Nina told me so much shit that Daisy had been spewing at work about Max. 

Daisy said that Max was abusing HER and painted him as some monster to everyone at work and then she lied about a pregnancy and kept talking about how the fetus wasn't growing when she'd already told Max that she'd lost it. 

That's just part of what Nina told me and what I am leaving out is way worse than that. 

After talking to Nina I thought on it for a week or so and called both of Max's brothers, A and J, and told them what I had heard and they talked to max about what I'd told them very vaguely and he called me and wanted me to tell him everything, which I did. I first made sure he was in a safe place and then told him everything Nina told me. He just listened and took it all in and then afterwards he said ""yeah this is over"" and told me he'd been trying to get out of this for a while but it's hard escape when Daisy was threatening him with suicide if he left her! Both Nina and I got out of abusive relationships and I told him that my abuser threatened me with it constantly but it was just to control me and I told Max that if he ever needed to talk about it he could always call me and I also told him to read on loveisrespect.org like someone suggested.

Then about a week ago he sends me that he is a free man! Almost 2 weeks after I'd told him all of this and I am soooooo happy! I know it had been the plan for him to break up with her for a while but after I told him all that Nina told me it was like what helped him finally get out and see just how Daisy is.

TL;DR : I meddled a little and my friend got out of an abusive relationship and I couldn't be happier for him !"
"Fiancée [27/F] went “too far” at bachelorette party. I [28/M] am ready to call it off. People are telling me not to due to “extenuating circumstances”.


I’ve been with my fiancée for going on 4 years. We got engaged a little over a year ago and were going to put a rush on the wedding because her mother was sick. Her mom had smoked for a long time, quit, picked it back up, and then developed cancer. To look at her mom, you’d never suspect she was a smoker, but had picked up the habit. Her mother grew too ill for a wedding so the idea of putting one together quickly faded and instead a couple of months ago, she passed. My fiancée was devastated to lose her mom at such a young age. I offered to postpone the wedding but she really wanted to move forward with it and took to planning. 

We agreed that we weren’t too interested in bachelor/bachelorette parties and instead decided we’d do something low key. Her Maid of Honor approached me about doing something more “substantive” for fiancée as she lost her mom not too long ago. I thought it was a good idea. I arranged for dinner/drinks and fun with my groomsmen. The Best Man (my brother) and my best friend booked a steakhouse and then arranged for drinks at a nice place afterwards. They bought me a nice cigar for the lounge and we had a tremendous time. 

Fiancée was texting me and then her phone died. She was out incredibly late – her friends said they packed it in around 5 AM and then slept most of the morning and hate a late lunch rather than brunch. When she got home she was still hungover and basically laid in bed and drank Gatorade instead of doing anything. The Saturday and Sunday were pretty much a write-off. She was that hungover. I asked her about it and she kept saying she pretty much has no recollection after a certain point. Her friends said something similar, that she was so obliterated after like 3 AM that they carried her to a friend’s brother’s bar where they hung out while my fiancée sipped booze while splayed in a chair. 

Things were fine until last night when she asked me to find something on her phone. I noticed a message come through saying my name, so yes, I snooped. It said “I also hope \[my real name\] doesn’t find out.” I scroll up and it’s a nightmare. This afternoon, my fiancée texts her Maid of Honor saying that she hasn’t been that drunk “in a long time” and her friend follows up with “I know” and a series of photos – my wife and her friends in a room – most of the women are topless, including my fiancée, and there’s a stripper. Fiancée responds “oh god. Can we not.” And another photo follows with the *stripper kissing her neck* while her friends are topless, holding booze and obviously acting poorly. Fiancee texts “I feel bad because \[my real name\] had such a tame night. He’s such a good boy. I hope he doesn’t find out.” That’s when MoH responds: “I also hope \[my real name\] doesn’t find out” and by this point has added “he’d leave you.” During their night out, someone must have used her phone to take photos to commemorate her little dalliance, because there must have been another half dozen photos on her phone. The worst being what looks like my topless fiancée laying on the bed with her friends around her and a naked stripper smelling his finger. I was horrified. 

I didn’t know what to do and didn’t want to come out and say I snooped so I tried to get her to talk about the evening. I told her about our evening. She deflected, said she was drunk, and that she never needs to be drunk again and then says something how she’s not at all jealous of her single friends and can’t wait to get married. We’re getting married ***in four weeks***. I couldn’t take it and told her I knew. She freaked out and at first got mad that I snooped but then realized the gravity of the situation. She began to apologize and hid behind being drunk. I didn’t accept that and she started crying. I went to another room to cool off and I guess she texted her friend because I received a flurry of texts telling me that it was a mistake and nothing happened. After a few hours of arguing, fiancée tells me that they went to someone’s house where they all got obliterated and a stripped arrived. They decided to take their tops off and have fun. The stripper did his thing and kissed my fiancée’s neck and chest and attempted to touch her genitals but she stopped him. They tipped him and he left. I didn’t handle it well and basically said that it didn’t really matter at the end of the day and that the wedding was off. She looked stunned. I threw some clothes into a bag and told her to leave. To my surprise she left.  Her Maid of Honor texted me that I’m an asshole and I replied asking how much of the money I contributed towards their night went to a stripper putting the moves on my fiancée? I haven’t heard from her since. 

I took the day off work and had to turn my phone off. My fiancée has texted evert 3 or 4 minutes. Her father called/texted and then sent me a long email. I checked my phone again about 6 minutes ago and it's non-stop texts from a bunch of people. No one on my side of the family knows. My fiancée is saying she'll do anything, she wants to come home, she's sorry. Her father texted me again to please call him and her friends added me to a WhatsApp group that basically outlines the whole night, their indiscretion and is telling me that she's sorry/they're sorry that she was too drunk and that I'm an asshole for not talking to them. 

&amp;#x200B;

I know I eventually have to say something. I don't know what to say or to whom. I don't even know how to handle this. Not in a million years would I have EVER thought my fiancée would do something like this. She's the most stable, earnest, nice and straightforward person ever. I don't understand it. I don't know what to do here. 

&amp;#x200B;

tl;dr fiancée got too drunk and flirty with a stripper and I think he fingered her. I found out after snooping and she's now staying at a friend's place and her whole friend/family circle is texting me non-stop. I don't know how to process this, what I should say next or how I should handle this."
"He (M42) won't leave me alone. (F25).


 I picked up a new hobby this year and met ""Paul,"" who has lots of experience with this particular activity. I felt lucky at first, thinking I found a friend with whom I could share my enthusiasm with. He and I quickly became close and we flirted lightly.

He became attached within two months, texting me as soon as he woke up (6 a.m.) and past midnight, even when I'd fallen asleep. I thought he was coming on strong, so I just responded to messages during the day and a few in the evening. Unfortunately, I didn't tell him that he was being too intense. In hindsight, I realize that was a mistake.

In the same time frame, which is just about two months into knowing me, he got a lot more overt. In this order, he would eventually talk about how good he is at sex, that he envisioned running away with me and starting a life together, that he could see the ""real me,"" and that he felt we connected on a spiritual level.

After he brought up his sexual abilities, I told him to stop because I wasn't comfortable with the direction the conversation was taking. I said I considered us friends only. He agreed to stop, and I foolishly kept on participating in my hobby with him, thinking I had settled things.

Well, things didn't get better. He got worse. He repeated what he said before in addition to parsing seemingly every word I said and twisting them. For instance, early on in knowing him, I had once said offhandedly that I like schedules and a sense of direction in my life (in those words.) He asked me later that night why I craved control.

He started sending long, rambling text messages about how he thought I needed to get more in tune with myself and resolve what he saw as a series of personal issues.

I'd long been fed up with him at that point and had told him to stop contacting me, full-stop. He didn't.

He's continuing to send rambling messages, though not with enough frequency to warrant a harassment charge or a police report. He hasn't been violent or threatening, just creepy and obsessive. But he's displayed a consistent willingness to not respect my boundaries and I don't know what he's capable of. He knows where I live, where I work, and where I park my car. I've blocked him on everything I can, but I'm afraid of him.

Is there anything else I can do? Or can someone give me some words of reassurance? I could really use them right now.

TL;DR: An older man has seemingly become obsessed with me and won't leave me alone."
"My (f23) husband (m33) is having sudden serious misgivings about our house


My husband and I bought this home in March. There is nothing wrong with it, it is a new construction detached 3 bd with 2 1/2 bath townhome in a nice area of PA. We were okay with the purchase and relatively happy in the house until recently. 

A neighbor came to talk to my husband. He told my husband that the build quality was shitty (why he is now living in his house idk) and the construction company was a joke. Now we did have a leak in our powder room right before we moved in, it was a freak accident (faulty valve in sink NOT an installation problem) nothing could have prevented it and it was not from shoddy building. The contractors (who are also still building other townhomes here) took care of it immediately and replaced our floor and fixed the sink. It took only two weeks from start to finish and we have had no other problems. 

Now my husband is doubting our decision to buy a home at all and says we only bought a home because I wanted one. We had been saving for two years and finally hit our goal right as we found out we were expecting child #2. He says we should have waited and rented for longer because he now makes more money and we could afford an even better home. He is also unsure about the quality of our neighbors. He believes that we rushed to make this purchase because our lease was coming to an end, but we did plan to move to a short term lease just in case we didn’t find a house in time.

These houses are selling very quickly, the houses down the road are already sold despite not being finished. Our house was 300k and is definitely not a crappy house. We did get a significant discount because we opted out of some features while our house was in its final stages and we did not get the basement finished. I now want to just sell the house because of his anxiety and stress.

We were both very anxious about buying a home and were nervous from the beginning about buying something and having something seriously wrong with it after it was too late. I don’t think it would have mattered where we moved to. He did suggest we keep renting and we did consider it. He also suggested buying a much cheaper home outright and just fixing it up as we go. I was okay with both of these suggestions. He was the one who ended up finding this new construction and seemed very okay with everything that was going on. Now I am frustrated and anxious (and almost 7 months pregnant). I asked him multiple times if this is what he wanted to do and if he was sure about this decision while reassuring him that I was fine living anywhere and I just wanted him to be sure. We obviously then bought and moved into the home. Now I am at a total loss of what to do or say.

TLDR: husband suddenly thinks we made a wrong choice in buying a house at all and tries to say we only bought a house because I wanted one."
"Did my [37F] behavior blur the boundaries?


tl;dr: I hung out with my son's poor friend and bought him a new pair of shoes. Now his mom is accusing me of trying to seduce her son. 

I am the mother of a 17-year-old boy. He is my only child. My son has 3 good friends whom he likes to invite over every weekend. In fact, they kind of remind me of real-life versions of the kids from South Park. My son would be Kyle and his friends are Kenny, Stan and Cartman. ""Kenny"" is the one we're having an issue with right now. 

We used to have Kenny over all the time. Both of his parents are chronically unemployed, and there is a history of domestic violence between the parents. The mother appears to have an untreated mental illness, and the father has a history of legal issues and arrests. Obviously, Kenny is very poor and his parents cannot afford to provide much for him. Kenny's mom will talk about all of the things she plans to do for him, but then doesn't follow through for whatever reason. Last fall Kenny's mother invited us to a birthday party at a state park for Kenny, but there was never any set date for the party. As it turns out, the party never happened. 

When I found out that Kenny got nothing for his birthday I bought him a cake and one present. I had the cake and present sitting on the kitchen table for him when he came over that weekend. When Kenny saw them he hugged me and looked like he was about to cry. A few months later when he came over around Christmas I had one present under the tree for him. It was an army style jacket (he's into military stuff) that I got on sale at Target. Then last month he was over on Easter and our family had an Easter basket for him. Basically, if he's over on a holiday we include him because that's what decent people do; it would feel pretty shitty to be over at a friend's house and have them exclude you from stuff, right? 

So, here's where stuff gets complicated. Kenny is an extremely active kid. He loves to walk/run/hike/do outdoorsy stuff. I am a gym rat. My son is a couch potato. The last time Kenny came over he wanted me to go for a run with him. It was cold and extremely windy (seriously, downed power lines and everything) so I told him that it wasn't safe for either one of us to go out for a run. I told him that I was planning on going to the gym and that he could come with me if he wanted to, which he did. My son was fast asleep and would not have gotten out of bed to exercise at 9:00am on a Saturday even if we had been able to wake him up, and my husband was at work, so Kenny and I went to the gym ourselves. I figured that since the gym is a public place it would not be considered inappropriate since we were not ""alone"". Kenny walked on the treadmill while I did my thing. I noticed that Kenny was wearing his combat boots so I asked if he had a pair of sneakers he could change into. He said that the only shoes he owned were on his feet, so I bought him a pair of sneakers for the gym. 

When I finished my workout he asked if I would take him out to lunch. We walked to the sandwich shop next door and I let him order what he wanted but I also ordered a meal for my son and specified that our order was to-go and that we should head back home so he could eat and we could give Kyle his sandwich. The rest of the day went normally, until Kenny went home. 
I don't know what Kenny said to his mother or how he portrayed the events of that day, but his mother was pissed. She accused me of trying to seduce her son. She said that the only reason I am nice to him is because I want to sleep with him. This hurts my heart and offends me to my very core. I consider Kenny part of the family and I have never said or done anything with Kenny that I would not say or do with my own son. Mrs. McCormick brought up every single gift Kenny has received, said that I'm trying to ""spoil him"" and make him fall for me. She said that I should ""never be that close"" with someone else's kid, etc. 
I should not have to clarify this but I am NOT attracted to Kenny, or any 17-year-old for that matter. He's a great kid and our whole family loves him. My husband and I are weebs, as is Kenny, so when Kenny comes over he introduces us to new anime and my husband, my son, Kenny and I all watch anime together. We do family activities, and play board games together- all of us. There is nothing to hide. 

So now it's been a month and we have not seen Kenny. He is not allowed over to our house anymore because his mom thinks I'm Michael Jackson and my house is Neverland Ranch. 

A little more context which could possibly contribute to this debacle: I was a young mom and I'm frequently mistaken for being much younger than I am. I'm 37 but people tend to think I'm like 23. I don't know if that has anything to do with it. Everyone I have asked for advice so far have said that they think Mrs. McCormick is just jealous. 

What do you think? Did any of my actions grey the boundaries? Another piece of pertinent info: She never actually confronted me. The way I found out about all of this was through my son. Should I try to call/talk to Mrs. McCormick and sort all of this out?"
"I (F/29) don’t feel comfortable being sexual with my husband (M/34) anymore after my weight loss.


I’ve been with my husband for 10 1/2 years. We started dating when I was 18 - a week before I turned 19. 

To preface; I was a chubby kid and teenager. Teased and bullied for years. It wasn’t till my senior year of high school that I finally started trying to be healthy and in shape. I lost 50 pounds during the time between the end of my senior year and the beginning of my first year post high school. 

So when I met my SO, it was about a year post high school and I was in the best shape of my life. We started dating and were almost immediately inseparable and had sex at any opportunity we could find. 

Years passed and we eventually moved in together, got engaged, bought a house, and got married. During those years I slowly but surely gained all 50 pounds back. 

While I was back at my heaviest our sexual relationship suffered greatly. I knew my husband was no longer attracted to me. He never vocalized that idea but I knew it to be true. He stopped slapping my ass as I walked by, stopped wanting spur of the moment sex, stopped wanting sex in general. I posted a few times in Dead Bedrooms since sex would only happen once every couple months and when it did it was because i basically begged him to and it felt like a “pitty  fuck”.  I always felt so ugly and unworthy.  He always blamed it on being tired or overworked but I never believed him. 

Well last year I decided to lose the weight again and I hit my goal weight a few months ago.  I now love looking at myself in the mirror again and love feeling like I can walk up stairs without being out of breath but I hate all the attention I’m getting from my husband again. 

As I was losing the weight he started looking at me with a sexual glow in his eyes, which I hadn’t seen in years. Started wanting to slap my ass as I walked by, wanted to give me extra long good bye kisses and everything else he hadn’t done while I was back at my heaviest. 

But now I feel so much resentment towards him. I now feel like he neglected me for being overweight and now that I’m back at the same weight that I was when I met him, I’m all of a sudden worthy of his affection again. 

I don’t like it when he touches me or even looks at me sexually. I’ve loved this man for many years but now i can’t emotionally get past this hurdle. 

I don’t know if we’re doomed or we should go to counseling or take a break.  I have no idea where to go from here. 

TL;DR: Bullied as a kid for being fat. Got thin and in shape after HS and then met my SO. 9 years later I had gained the weight back and had a dead bedroom. Lost the weight again recently and SO all of a sudden wants an active sex life. I hate all this attention after years of perceived neglect."
"I (30M) would like advice on how to handle the relationship with my sister (35F) after she threatened and tried to assault my pregnant, disabled wife (30F).


I need advice on how appoach a conflict between my sister and my family.

My sister was having a lot of trouble with her husband. He left her and was living with another woman in another state and was not taking care of their daughter at all. My wife and I stepped in and helped with whatever my sister needed during this time. My wife was my sisters closest confidant during this time and my sister had my wife read really graphic conversations between her husband and this other woman which made my wife really uncomfortable around her husband. 

Then like 6 months passed and my sister and her husband patched things up. His father died and the fantasy that living with a different woman would somehow be perfect faded into reality after those 6 months. My sister was basically demanding that everyone welcome him back into the family immediately and treat him with the utmost respect. My family sweeps everything under the rug, so most people went along with it. My wife was supportive of my sister getting back with her husband if that’s what she wanted to do, but my wife did not feel comfortable around him and said it would take her some time to be.

First, almost immediately after he came back, we were having a family party and said we didn’t want him to come over. My sister snapped. She started rage texting- calling my wife every name in the book and saying she wasn’t going to respect my wife if we couldn’t respect her husband. My wife felt my sister was projecting her anger that she was feeling towards her husband on us because they never really dealt with it- they just pretended like it never happened. My wife was also super pregnant and had a disability that was causing her tremendous pain during her pregnancy so she was at a point where she just didn’t want to deal with the drama. 

Fast forward a couple months, we hadn’t talked to my sister or resolved anything. My sister never reached out to apologize for going nuts on my wife and we didn’t reach out either, so we didn’t invite her to our baby shower. We really just wanted to avoid drama. You will read how well that went in a min. 

Up until this point we had avoided seeing each other anywhere. We made sure when we went to my moms house that my sister wasn’t around. On this particular day- maybe a week after our baby shower- we missed a text from my mom saying to wait to come over because my sister was almost at her house. We arrived at about the same time and my sister lost her mind. She was pissed we didn’t invite her to the baby shower and she was not handling her emotions well. We were inside my moms house and in front of her daughter and our other niece she was screaming profanity at my wife. She charged at my almost 9 month pregnant wife who needed a cane to walk at the time.  

It was aggressive to the point where my mother and I had to restrain her and then she told my wife she hoped she had a miscarriage that day, basically saying she wanted my daughter to die because she was very much capable of living outside my wife by that point. My wife stayed calm and did not escalate with my sister. My wife was trying to put the kids in a separate room so they did not see my sister going insane. My wife almost called 911 when my sister ran at her to assault her, but we managed to leave. Afterwards my sister continued to snap- she threw a metal water bottle towards my moms head and put a hole in the wall. My other sister was studying for one of her graduate classes when my mom called her and told her what was happening. She was scared for her young daughter who was there and called the police. 

Fast forward 2 years, and my sister has never met my 2 year old. My wife made it clear after this happened that she has no interest in ever being around my sister again because she believes she has an undiagnosed mental illness or at the very least needs some serious counseling/anger management. She does not believe that my sister is a safe person to be around our children. Recently we found out we are having another child. 

My crazy sister reached out through my other sister with a long apology via text because we refuse to see her and we have her blocked. Now that she apologized I’m hoping we can at least get on a civil level so we can see our niece. However, with my wife being pregnant again and with what my sister said about our daughter, my wife has made it very clear that she does not want to have any interaction with my sister or have her around our children unless she gets psychological help. My wife doesn’t care if I talk to my sister if I want to, but I don’t know if my sister will let me take my niece to meet my daughter unless my wife makes an effort to talk to her too or allows my sister to see my daughter. 

I’m just not sure what the right move is here. I helped raise my niece because her dad was a lousy father when she was little, so I miss her a lot and I want my niece to know my kids. Do I bother reaching out to my sister if my wife doesn’t want anything to do with her anyways? I feel bad that my kids will miss out on time with cousins and family events because my wife doesn’t want them around my sister, but I also completely understand the reasoning behind it. We don’t live nearby anymore, so at this point it’s more of a once/twice a year or big family event issue.

Side notes:
- My family is Islamic and it’s common within the family to try and mend relationships no matter the issue For example, cheating and domestic abuse isn’t a reason for divorce. Divorce is allowed, but strongly discouraged and looked at as shameful for a woman- such bs.
- I do not follow same practices and do not condone the behavior
- My wife and I also do not tolerate abuse or allow children to witness such incidents 
- Having grown up with my sister and continuously experiencing her episodes throughout her adolescent years, I’m more accustomed to her craziness and behavior than my wife
- My mother supports any decisions that we decide to do but constantly tries to mend the relationship between both parties even though she cyclically does not speak to my sister and has said she believes she needs to be medicated 

TL;DR my wife, unborn child and I were threatened and almost assaulted by my sister 2 years ago and she finally decided to reach out to apologize"
"[UPDATE] My [25 M] Aunt [late 50's F] has been a manipulative asshole to and towards my mother [mid 50's F] for nearly the entire time they've known each other. My aunt just found out she has Stage IV lung cancer and I don't know how to feel about this.


Original https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/8ymi8x/my_25_m_aunt_late_50s_f_has_been_a_manipulative/

Mainly posting this for closure as I know my original post didn't get much attention.

After I made the post, and on my therapist's recommendation, I spoke to my mom privately on how she felt. As I suspected, she was indifferent to my aunt's condition. While she felt bad for my cousins, she had little sympathy for my aunt and we decided to just support the rest of the family as best as we could.

We all went down to see my aunt a month after her diagnosis and her treatment had just began. Her hair was already falling out and she was having trouble speaking. It was clear to me that any sort of revenge/comeuppance I wanted for her personally was going to pale in comparison to what the cancer was doing. We had a pleasant weekend with everyone and my aunt hugged me and thanked me for visiting her. That was the last time I saw her.

She passed away a month ago shortly after she decided to stop treatment. I went to her funeral just for the closure. My mom skipped the ceremony to take care of some things she couldn't get off. That's not a BS excuse but she was glad to have it. I consoled my cousins/dad and that's that. My aunt will be a cautionary tale of...something I guess; a boogeyman to tell children about. I want to believe it was karma that did this but I know it was probably sheer coincidence. However, dying before 60 with your grandchildren never remembering you is  a hell of a punishment I guess. Thanks for reading.

TL;DR: My aunt is dead."
"I (24f) tried to have the “marriage talk” with my boyfriend (26m), and it did not go well


We have been together for almost 10 years now. 
Almost 2 years ago I moved across country with him for him to go to grad school. Now that he’s graduated, me moving to another state with him for a new job is now on the table. 
Last night I sat down with him and just brought up my concerns with moving again and wanted to hear his concerns/ how job hunting was going. At the end of the conversation, I brought up how worried I was again about moving to another state with him. I brought up how we have never really had a conversation about marriage and how all I wanted to hear from him is that there’s a commitment from him before I move with him again. I told him I was NOT expecting/wanting him to propose before the move or even in the next year or two. Were young, and not fully financially stable yet, so I really am in no rush. 
I told him I just wanted to know if he is fully committed and he knows he wants to marry me in the future.  He couldn’t tell me that. 
After I finished talking, we just sat in silence for 2 minutes because he didn’t say anything. At that point I started to panic and told him that him not saying anything was worrying me.
All he could say was “well I believe in us” “I don’t want you to worry about it” “I mean I do want to be with you forever” and kept repeating that he believes in us. Didn’t say one word about marriage or letting me know he wants to even marry me. 
At that point I couldn’t help but cry and go to bed. He didn’t check on me or say anything else. 

Am I overreacting? He did say “he wants to be with me forever” but it wasn’t too convincing. 

At this point I’m not sure what to think/do/say to him. I’m just bummed and want some opinions from this.

TLDR: Been with boyfriend for almost 10 years. Before moving to another state again, asked boyfriend if he wants to marry me in the future and he couldn’t tell me."
"I (31F) am the subject of an old acquaintance’s delusions (29M) and I don’t know what to do?


I have seen or spoken to “Tom” since high school. Yesterday, he sent me a long Facebook message accusing me of surveilling his family for the government and trying to control his thoughts. The messages continued this morning. In his rambling, I gather that I’m essentially a physical representation of his right wing conspiracy theories that have clearly manifested into delusions. He’s convinced I’m working for the DNC and George Soros to monitor and report on his and his family’s activity and he keeps comparing me to Hitler and going on about how his side is going to beat my side. 

It’s pretty clear he’s not in his right mind and needs help. I am worried that this could easily escalate to violence (against me or others), and it would be pretty easy for him to find my work address. That said, he hasn’t explicitly threatened me, so I don’t know that the police would do anything. I’m also worried if I get the police get involved it would only serve to validate his delusion that I’m the conduit reporting his activity to the government. 

I’m not close with his family and I’ve already unfriended him on FB. Do I ignore him and hope his obsession goes away? What should I do here?

Tl;Dr the creepy guy from high school thinks I’m monitoring him and his family and I don’t know what to do about it."
"My sister (27F) didn't tell me (25M) that her new husband is a Tier 2 sex offender.


She's been with this guy for a few years. My family(mom 52f, dad 55m) tried to welcome him in but my wife (30f) was very hesitant. We had just had a baby and she hated the new guy my sister was dating. My wife didn't want him around and said he creeped her out. My family pushed my wife to 'get over it' and that she was just being hormonal. I told my wife that I thought she was going overboard but I agreed to assuage her fears by not letting him be around our young daughter. 

This week my sister told me that he is a registered sex offender and spent years in federal prison for possession of child porn. My wife is livid at my sister for not telling us and for my family telling her that she was crazy when she was totally right to be concerned. My wife and I have decided that we are done seeing him forever, that my sister needs to divorce him and apologize for hiding this from us, and that my parents need to be told that new flames shouldn't be automatically made family in the first month. 

Are we in the right here?

TL;DR Sister didn't tell us her husband was a sex offender for child porn possession and brought him around even though we have a young daughter. We want to cut him off, give my family an intervention, and demand an apology from her as well as divorce. Is this too much? Not enough?"
"My boyfriend [30] of 6 years is unsatisfied with our sex life and blames me [27F]


Hi all, 

My boyfriend [30M] and I [27F] have been together for around 6 years now. It's been a very turbulent last few years and I'm certain we're both going to have to start to make tough decisions soon but I do love him and we live together.

So today he tried to wake me this morning and I didn't wake up. I texted him when I had woke up telling him to have a good day and he asks how am I awake, saying he tried to wake me. I really don't know how but I never even felt him. In the past he's gotten mad because he's tried to wake me up but I'm a heavy sleeper and sleep a lot. Because in the past he's tried to wake me up for sex and been mad when I haven't woken up, I was like ""aw I want to have sex with you, wish I would have woke up. sorry."" We live with other people and those other people recently left for a week and we had sex 3 times. They had just come back yesterday so I was a little surprised he chose today to initiate sex but by all means.

In response to me wishing I had gotten up, he says he wishes he had a girlfriend he didn't have to train. He repeatedly talked about how our sex has gotten worse (won't specifically tell me why). I told him we could watch porn together and get ideas and sometimes I look things up to spice things up. He said he will never watch porn with me.

He said he told a friend of his that maybe the week that we had alone time would be different and we'd have more sex.  I immediately said why are you telling your friends but not me? He said he shouldn't need to put in a formal request for sex and I'm clueless ""as if I'm the first person you've ever had sex with."" (I'm a little insecure about my low body count; I've always been a shy late bloomer and a little bit of a nerd.) He often lately talks about wishing he had a different girlfriend who cared and it breaks the fuck out of my heart every time.

It's teaching the point where I wonder if I'm being clueless and if our relationship is salvageable. I have no friends to talk to about sex so I come to the internet. Can we spice things up? Am I really fucking up here? Am I being selfish or naive by expecting him to talk to me?

TL;DR: My bf tries to wake me up for sex but I don't often get the signal. I'm awkward at sex and initiating things and it makes him angry. How can we spice things up? Am I being selfish by thinking he can just talk to me?"
"[Update] My (24f) bf (24m) overreacts to video games, not sure what to do


[Original Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/bh6v5h/my_24f_bf_24m_overreacts_to_video_games_not_sure/)

TL;DR: I broke up with my boyfriend. It was disconcertingly one-sided, but... I think he handled it ok?.... Its hard to interpret silence.

The below is just recounting the details of how it went down. Probably way more details than anyone cares to read lol, but there it is. 

I did it at the end of last month, 3 days after my post, and 5 days after the incident that I had made the post about. The day after the post I was still at his house and I was still treating things normally, for the most part. 

I went home and took a few days to ruminate. Consulted with a friend who echoed the same opinion as you all who commented: break up. 

I didn’t want to wait to the last minute before he was moving away that weekend, so that he would have a few days to process and recover before packing and driving with his family hours away. So that Monday is when I decided it had to be done. 

I did it over text. I am not happy about that, and didn’t make that decision lightly. The primary reason was that he does not live close to me (1.75-4 hours away and $17-70 roundtrip, depending on the mode of transportation). My next preference would be a phone call, but we’ve never talked on the phone, just text, neither of us are phone people. Lastly, I was afraid if I made it all the way out there I may chicken out, which I don’t have time for, since as noted above, he was moving away in a few days, and also since I wanted to make sure I mentioned everything I needed to say (the incident from the original post was the catalyst for the break up, but there were other contributing factors too). 

So I laid everything out over a series of text messages. In the last one I apologized for it being over text (and mentioned the reasoning for doing so, not just bc the relationship meant nothing. Though I do fully understand people who have that viewpoint), and told him he can call me when he gets my messages to discuss further. 

No response. 

I wait. Hours, nothing. I start to get concerned, particularly since last time there was a big strain on the relationship (1+ year ago) he constantly talked of being better off dead. I text his mom, who should be home by that time to let her know we’ve broken up and to make sure he’s alright in the time ahead. She hadn’t known yet. I stopped worrying so frantically since she didn’t say anything else, so that must’ve meant all was fine in regards to his safety. 

Another day passes. And another. The last message in our conversation is still my original breakup message. 

I reach out the afternoon of the 3rd day, since I have some things I still needed to retrieve from his house and some to return to him, before he moved out of town that weekend. I ask if I can come by tomorrow to exchange things. 

No response. 

I text him that night telling him its ok if he does not want to talk or interact whatsoever. I tell him I’ll come by tomorrow, just to leave my stuff outside and I can leave his at their front door, no interaction necessary. 

No response. 

I start the 2 hour public transport journey there the next day, and tell him my ETA. 

No response. 

I arrive there. None of my stuff is outside. I worry that I went all the way there just to have him barricade himself inside. From the front door, I call his phone, rather than sending yet another text into the void. 

No response. 

That worry becomes more real. But then, I see him come to the door. He opens it, without even looking at me, and immediately heads back to his room. I stand at the doorway, unsure what to do- I didn’t wanna force myself into his space if he was gonna just quickly bring the things to me to exchange. I waited a few moments til it was clear he wasn’t coming back, then headed to his room. He sat at the edge of his bed facing the wall as I gathered my things. On the bright side, he still had a sense of humor- he chuckled and made a comment as I struggled putting away one of my things. That almost made things feel like they were still normal. 

We finally make some eye contact when he tells me he has a black eye. His friend punched him in the face, he said. It was over a stupid (in his words) argument (over a fictional character...)- he slapped his friend and his friend punched him. I’m not sure who did it first. I’m assuming they were not sober at the time of this event, but I didn’t probe further. 

He didn’t say anything else while I was there, nothing at all regarding the breakup. Although I wanted to ask him about his side of things, I didn’t wanna make him talk if he didn’t want to. So all I asked, is if there’s anything I can work on myself. He silently shook his head no, still facing the wall. Though after a pause he did give me a non-serious answer regarding something he always teased me about (in a lighthearted, joking way). I tell him that can’t be it, but to let me know. I stand there for a bit, seeing if there’s anything at all he wanted to say or ask. Nothing happens, so I tell him that I guess I’ll be heading out then, and I immediately start walking out. In that moment I see him finally turn to to look at me instead of the wall/floor. I let myself out the front door, and on the way home sent one final text, thanking him for letting me inside to exchange our stuff, telling him that I’ll leave him alone now since he didn’t want to discuss anything, and wishing him well. 

It felt super weird having broken up a year+ relationship, and especially so suddenly (from his standpoint), yet him to have absolutely no response to it. It’s not that I want him promising to change and begging for me back or something. Just... something, anything. A break up should involve both people, mutual dialogue.

I don’t know if he didn’t respond because of the shock of the breakup and/or he was till processing it. Or because of the fact it was over text- that I didn’t deserve any response if I was able to end a long term relationship like that. I may never know. But it’s over now, and we’ll both have to move on regardless."
"My (28/f) friend (26/f) brings her mom (50’s?) to her job interviews. This in turn has lead to her getting 0 job offers after grad school. Should I get involved?




TLDR: Just as the title says. She lives with her parents and it’s not a cultural thing (white and midwestern), I’ve always known her mom was “protective” but since she’s graduated from grad school it’s gotten to a point where it’s really impacting her life. I don’t know if it’s even my place to get involved and explain that to most people it’s really weird that her mother accompanies her into the interview.

So now for the long version. “Tina” is an absolute amazing woman, she graduated top of her class from a top program in her field. I work in an adjacent field and have some overlap in the companies that are looking to hire. 

She spent her time in graduate working under two professors who are very well known and published. Though outside of her practicum and research she has no work experience.  She got tons of interviews through her connections to professors and her impressive academic resume. We are also in an area that has a high demand for her degree. She should be swimming in job offers but instead she has received none, not even a second interview. 

I heard from a mutual acquaintance that the relatively close knit field Tina is in the employees from different companies are all talking about the interviewee who brought their mother into the interview. It’s reflected badly enough that word got to my mutual acquaintance who told me as she knows I’m friends with Tina. I don’t know if I even should bring this up with Tina, or how to go about it if I do. Any advice would be greatly appreciated. 


Additional info: 

I’ve always known Tina comes from an overprotective family, but she’s so normal
I always took the quirks as well family quirks. Her older brother didn’t move out until he got a job across the country at 30 and her mother was freaked out because the whole family has never left Oklahoma. Her mother spent two months living with the brother after he moved to make sure he “settled in”. 

She also has no social media, not even a LinkedIn because she “isn’t allowed”. With the explanation being that employers will look at it and ?? I’m not quite sure. She’s not the kind of person who even if she did have social media would post anything that would make an employer upset/uncomfortable. Her mother’s other argument is that people will use it to find/kidnap Tina. Like those old myspace warnings that used to run on the news of the dangers of strangers on the internet. 

There’s tons of other smaller things like not being allowed to drive past 11pm, not going to nail salons because their “sex traffickers”, basically anything very headline news warnings of “YOU WONT BELIEVE WHATS SECRETLY KILLING YOU.”  And Tina is such a genuinely good person she won’t break these rules because she feels to guilty to confront her mom about them."
"I [30F] think my dad [68M] has another daughter that he has no idea about.


Hi all,

About a year and a half ago, I \[30F\] did a DNA test from ancestry. My main purpose was to determine my ethnicity because my parents are both muts themselves. I eventually received/enjoyed the results and haven't thought about it much since.

Fast forward to two days ago. I get a message on ancestry from a woman (we'll call M) who is 46, saying she was born in '72 and then put up for adoption. M recently obtained her birth certificate and found her birth mother's name, which she provided in the message. M stated since we shared DNA, she was wondering if perhaps I knew any information about her birth mother. I didn't recognize the name, so I called my parents who didn't recognize the name, and later they said they also asked my aunt (father's sister) who didn't recognize the name. I didn't think any more about it until yesterday.

Yesterday, I went on ancestry and decided to click on ""my DNA matches"". Low and behold, M is listed as ""close family"". To give some perspective if you're not familiar with ancestry, I also matched with my first cousin ""D"". D is listed as my 1st cousin, sharing 969 cM across 45 segments (this is common for 1st cousins and great grandparents). M, however, shares 1,541 cM across 54 segments with me (this is common for grandparents, aunts/uncles, and half-siblings). So I kind of start freaking out. I click on the shared matches between M and I, and am able to determine through those family trees that we are related on my dad's side.

So then I start thinking about timelines. My dad was born in 1951, M was born in 1972, very possible that he could be her father.

I reach out to M for some more information. She stated that her birth mother's name had since changed (marriage), but someone M shared DNA with on ancestry was able to provide her with her birth mother's married name. M reached out to her mother at the end of March (certified mail) but hasn't heard back yet. M was born in the same state as my family, and still lives there with her now husband and 2 sons. M's birth mother lives in the same state as my family, and more precisely IN THE SAME TOWN my family did for the last 30 years (my parents and I both moved last summer to separate states). M's birth mother has since had 4 kids, and when I facebooked the name, found I went to high school at the same as at least one of them, based on our mutual friends. M's birth mother is now 66, around the same age as my dad.

So 2 days ago I unknowingly asked my parents if they knew the name of the women I think my dad may have unknowingly had a child with. My gut feeling is perhaps he had a 1 night fling with this woman in his early 20s and never knew she was pregnant. M did mention she thinks her birth mother was sent away to have the baby and lived in a home for un-wed mothers. In my mind, I love my father no matter what, and this would have occurred many years before my mother entered the picture. So now I am left with a big burden of if I mention it to him again with all these details, and if so how? I also now feel an obligation to M, a woman who never knew her birth parents and is now so close to answers she's always wanted. Any advice would be SO appreciated.

TLDR; According to my DNA results, I have a half-sister who I think my dad has no idea about."
"My [25 F] fiance [31 M] makes me feel like I'm losing my mind.


Me and ""Jake"" have been dating for 4 years, lived together for a year and a half, and then last year we decided to live apart for a while because I was very unsatisfied when we lived together (lack of intimacy, feeling like he wouldn't do any chores, etc..) since living apart our relationship has definitely improved and we have been playing to move back in with each other when my lease is up next week. 

Recently though he has been making me feel like I am absolutely insane because I keep freaking out over the smallest things, for example, I like Cheetos, he knows I like Cheetos, when he is at the store and asks if I want anything, I'll politely ask if he can get me up some Cheetos, then when he comes home, he shows me he bought Takis, usually I'll be like ""lol why did you get me Takis, i asked for Cheetos?"".
He will always apologize and say he didn't even realize I wanted Cheetos. Now normally I'm like ""its cool don't worry, thanks for picking me something up anyway""

Obviously, that to me is how a relationship should be, explain the problem, talk it out, move on. Now here's where it gets annoying, 2 days later he'll be out at the store again, ask what I want, I specifically said ""not Takis lol, Cheetos ;)"" then he comes home without buying me anything so I'm like :/ ""why did you ask if I wanted something if you weren't going to get me anything"" and of course I'm met with ""Oh I'm sorry, I totally forgot to get Cheetos, that was my bad I'm sorry babe!"" I say it's whatever and I'll just buy em for myself next time.

I start buying Cheetohs from now on, easy solution, right? Well, he comes over and eats all my Cheetos?! I say ""wtf dude like why are you intentionally trying to make me upset, I specifically bought these for myself, we already had 2 issues with the Cheetohs why did you eat them??"" he again profusely apologizes saying that he ""didn't even realize babe, I know I'm being an idiot recently, it was completely just a lack of foresight"", I don't know what to do so I end up just rolling my eyes. He offers to fix it by going to the store right then and buying me Cheetohs. I'm like um whatever just stop being annoying. He acknowledges he is being annoying and goes to the store to try and fix things..

He proceeds to call me from the store saying he's sorry, and he's going to make it up to me, so you know what he does? He comes home with fucking Spicy Doritos!? At this point, I feel like he's just trying to piss me off or something?! I legit yell at him ""WTF WHAT IS YOUR PROBLEM? WHY TF DID YOU GO TO THE STORE AND BUY ME DORITOS?!?"" obviously I know that was an overreaction but at this point, I've lost all my patience. He again gets all upset that he messed up and he's confused why I'm freaking out over chips.. he is almost crying saying he knows he's an idiot and that it was just a mistake that he grabbed them. So obviously I'm like questioning my reality of the events happening?? So I basically tell him to ""just go home I don't really want to deal with a stupid argument tonight""

This is just one example obviously, but this sort of problem is in almost every aspect of our relationship on the most trivial things. It has become so formulaic and something like this or similar happens probably 2-3 times a week at this point. I don't know what to do because he will do something silly or thoughtless, Ill be a little annoyed, he will acknowledge that it annoyed me, we will move on, and usually within 24 he will do something similar again, Ill get pretty annoyed, he will do it again, I'll get pissed off, he continues to apologize and acknowledge my feelings, and then do it again till I start screaming about some small issue.  It's so frustrating constantly questioning your own sanity because every damn time he will look me in the eyes and apologize, fully acknowledging he was in the wrong. I truly don't feel he is doing anything out of malice either, I don't know though. I feel like I'm caught in a loop almost. 

But as I said my lease is ending at the end of the week and the thought of living with these issues 24/7 makes me want to vomit. 

Other than stuff like this ^ he is usually a very loving, generous, sweet, and supportive person. So the fact that I'm now writing this entire thing over stupid shit like chips, makes me feel like I'm insane, but I know if I just vent to him again he will just apologize and it will happen again in an hour. Thanks for reading those of you who got this far, just looking for some different perspectives right now on what I should do.

**TL;DR: Fiance does a small annoying thing, I get annoyed, he says sorry but keeps doing it, I get mad, he acknowledges its annoying and he will stop, but then continues to do it, I freak out, he gets upset that I freak out over small things.**"
"My [25F] fiance [28M] has so many more friends to invite to our wedding. I feel small for caring, and small for not having more friends.


I am so lucky to be marrying the man of my dreams, Rob. We have been together for 2.5 years, and he just popped the question a few months ago. He is everything I could ever want: kind, patient, smart, loving, funny, the whole laundry list. And because he's so many wonderful things, he's attracted tons of friends throughout his life that share my admiration of him.

He grew up in Rhode Island, which for those not from the USA is not far from New York City, which is where we met and live now. He's still close with nearly a dozen friends from high school and half a dozen friends from college (also in RI), not to mention the dozens of friends he has here in NYC from adulthood. Though many of them live in his hometown, he sees them frequently for trips home to his parents, meetups, or their own weddings.

As for me, not so much. I am from a small town in the South where I never really fit in. I have two or three acquaintances from high school I barely keep in touch with, and a handful of friends from college, all of whom remained in our hometown or in other southern cities. My life more or less started over when I moved to NYC and my small group of close friends (\~5 people) are all I really have. Until recently, I never wanted more--they're incredible people and I'm lucky to have them. But looking at my small list of friends I want to invite to the wedding makes \*me\* feel small compared to Rob's big life.  


Whereas he could send dozens of invites to family members, I only have my parents and two grandparents. He has dozens of friends from high school and college; I hardly have any, and those who I am close to can't finance the trip from down South for a wedding in NYC. It makes me feel like this big day, which I've been told essentially since birth is the most important in my life, will be more about Rob than it is me.  


Rob, incredible and patient as he is, consoles me and tells me not to look at it this way. He says our wedding is a celebration of our lives coming together; there's no ""Rob's friends"" and ""OP's friends,"" there's only ""our"" friends and ""our family."" But that feels easy for him to say, when 75% of the people there will have known him since he was a kid.

Has anyone had a similar experience? Is there a way I can reframe this to feel better? Any advice would be appreciated. 

  
\*\*TL;DR\*\* incredible fiance has lived a full, incredible life, and naturally attracted lots of friends along the way. This, coupled with his big family, makes me feel bad when preparing our wedding guest list--I have a smaller, closer-knit group and a much smaller family. How do I stop feeling small, too?"
"I wrote my boyfriend a letter about my feelings and he told me to ""stop making it about me""


My boyfriend (30M) and I (26F) have been together for about a year and a half. We currently live together and have for 8 months. We have had some difficult times, but generally we get along. We both have mental health issues (depression/anxiety), the only difference is that mine is treated by medications/therapy and his isn't. The other day I wrote him a 3 page letter because I have been feeling unsure about our future. A lot of times when we argue, it goes unresolved and he doesn't like to talk about it. Most of our arguments happen when he is very anxious and becomes irritable with me. I basically told him that he needs to find a way to cope with his anxiety and feelings that don't involve taking it out on me, if this is going to work. I also reiterated what I want out of the relationship in the future (marriage, house, kids), which I have never kept a secret. I believe that deep down he wants these things too but he is hesitant. Again, I believe it makes him anxious. I wrote him a letter to read when I wasn't around so he could read it and try to approach it with a level head and really think about what I was saying. After reading the letter this is basically how our conversation went (over messenger)....

&amp;#x200B;

Him: Cool story

Me: Alright....I appreciate you taking me seriously. (I was being sarcastic)

Him: My mother fell down and broke her ankle. She might need surgery. My family is getting money together to send my brother and my uncle out there to be with her and take care of the house. I've got a few more important things on my mind right now than your emotional 5 page story you want me to read.

Me: When did this happen? When I get paid I can give some money to help if you want. I'm sorry, it sucks because she is all alone and your dad just got here. I understand you have things going on too, but I didn't know about your mom, and it's not fair for you to say ""more important"" things, like my feelings aren't important. I think that's pretty rude. It's not a story, it's how I feel and if that isn't important to you, it kinda proves my point. I'm not saying that we have to deal with this right now but I had to get my thoughts out. Let me know if there is anything I can do to help.

Him: Stop making it about you. That's how you can help.

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR; I wrote my boyfriend a letter about my feelings. I came at a bad time and he basically told me I was being selfish."
"My boyfriend [36M] hit his dog and it's making me [29F] seriously consider breaking up with him.


I'm not sure if I'm overreacting here. My boyfriend and I have been together for about 10 months. Good guy. Very career-oriented. Generous. I've noticed he tends to be physically confrontation in different situations - never with me - but with others. For example, there was one time a few months back when some guy intentionally flipped up my skirt and snapped the band of my underwear and my boyfriend lost it. I begged him to just walk away and he just wouldn't. They got into a fistfight and my boyfriend got the worst of it.

Anyways, I'm only sharing this story because I'm thinking about all the times he's been physically violent in the past. That's the only time, until recently and it was with his own dog.

We were taking a walk through the city. His dog was on a leash, but we crossed paths with a mom pushing a stroller. His dog (harmless dog) suddenly got excited and jumped onto the stroller with his front paws and stuck his head into the baby's face. My boyfriend reacted by yanking on the leash so hard, his dog struck the ground on his side. After the mom walked away, he proceeded to smack the dog with his bare hand, repeatedly saying ""BAD DOG!"" and hitting him again. I told him to stop it and he did. His dog was whimpering.

I don't know if I'm overreacting here or what, but I told him that was completely unnecessary. I really have a low threshold for violence like this, but he played it off and says, ""it's okay, you have a tender heart, I know..."" but that's not what the issue is here.

I guess I'm looking for advice here. He's not a bad guy, but this incident with his own dog has really made me consider ending things. Am I overreacting here?

TL;DR: BF hit his own dog after an incident, and I have a zero-tolerance for it. Not sure if this is the breaking point and if I should consider ending things entirely."
"I (32/F) found Tinder on my husband's (32/M) phone last night and he essentially tried to gaslight me when I asked him about it.


We've been together for nine years and married for three. Although we were on the younger side when we initially met, I honestly have no desire to be with anyone else. That's why I decided to marry him. Recently a couple we're close friends with have decided to get a divorce. Their circumstances were similar to ours in that they met in uni and hadn't been with anyone else since. My husband has been spending a lot of time with the guy friend in that couple and has also expressed the fact that he wonders if maybe we had ""rushed things"" without really explaining to me what he meant by that and how dating for six years before getting married counts as ""rushing things"" at all. When I asked him about it, he just shrugged it off and said that he didn't know why he had even said that. 

Thinking maybe the divorce between our friends had influenced his thinking a little, I decided to let it slide. Sometimes I wonder as well. But that's really all it is. I would never voice those concerns to him unless they were utterly genuine. Not just a fleeting thought I had somehow had at one point in time. I think most married couples have similar thoughts. It's normal. Suggesting to your SO that maybe you've ""rushed things"" isn't quite as normal. Not to me. 

That exchange had happened about three months ago. Since then I haven't really thought about it. Things have been ... good. More than good. Not that they were bad before. But just ... I can tell he's been trying more. He makes more of an effort to find things to do on our date nights. He picks up after himself far more than he used to. Usually he takes care of the outdoor maintenance and leaves me to do most of the washing and cleaning inside the house, which works for us. But now he washes up more and cooks more and still manages to get the outdoor maintenance done on time. Because we both work a lot, it's hard for us to really find the energy to do more than we have to. So, of course, I told him that I've noticed he's been helping out more and that I deeply appreciate it. 

He's also been looking up trips for us to go on. Wine tours and things. I usually take care of things like that. Planning and things. But he insisted on doing it on his own this time. I figured maybe he was preparing something nice for us. Our last trip where it was just us was over a year ago. Usually we travel for work or family gatherings. 

Anyway last night he was working late and jumped in the shower the moment he returned home. I didn't think anything of it. What I did find strange was that he took his phone with him, which he usually never does. My husband is nowhere near as attached to his phone as most people are. He's the person that usually forgets it at work or at home and doesn't think twice about it. The fact that he took it in the bathroom with him ... weird. Once he was out I asked him if he was in the mood for a glass of wine as I had just poured myself one. He said okay. I popped into the kitchen to get him a glass and when I came back to the bedroom, he was on his phone and then immediately tucked it away when he noticed me at the doorway. I laughed and jokingly asked if he was texting his girlfriend, and he laughed back as this is a joke of ours. I joke that he has a secret girlfriend and he jokes that I have a secret boyfriend. But it's only ever been a joke. At least for me. 

We had our wine, watched some of The Office and then he tried having sex with me but I told him that I wasn't feeling in the mood that night. He said he understood and went to sleep. Maybe twenty minutes later his phone screen lit up and I saw that he had a notification from Tinder. A new match. At first I was in shock, thought that I was just seeing things, but the notification was clear as day. I woke up and asked him about it and his immediate reaction was, ""Why are you looking through my phone?"" to which I obviously said I wasn't looking through it and that I had just noticed the massive, glaring Tinder notification that had flashed across the screen. He was visibly taken aback and confused and still half asleep. The moment I grabbed his phone to tap on the screen and show him the notification, he snatched it out of my hands and got all quiet after. He knew the truth. I knew the truth. I just needed him to admit it to me. 

Instead he made it about invading his privacy and that I was overreacting and that he obviously wasn't going to ""see any of them"" anyway. It was just ""a joke"" to him. When I asked if that was why he had taken his phone into the bathroom with him and then tucked it away from me earlier, he had no words. He just looked at me like I was crazy for even insinuating that he had been hiding something from me. Obviously he was hiding something. He was just upset that I had found it. 

When I told him to find somewhere else to sleep that night, he offered to show me the messages to prove that nothing was going on. Mostly he was just swiping around and getting matches, but he had only exchanged messages with two women on there and had said no when they asked to go out for drinks. I maintained that he had to sleep somewhere else, and so he went to his brother's house (which was confirmed to me by his SIL) and then came back in the morning before work to apologize and to explain. I gave him five minutes to tell me why I shouldn't leave him on the spot and he said that he was just ""curious"" but that it was only curiosity, not desire. We've been together so long, some ""small and stupid"" part of him wanted to know if he ""still had it"" after all these years. I asked him what he plans on doing later down the line when he wants to know if he ""still has it"" then and he reassured me that he's not curious anymore and that it was just a ""thoughtless"" thing that he did for a week because that one guy friend was on it and constantly talking about it. 

He admitted that he obviously should have known better and that he is his own person not to be influenced into that sort of thing, however unintentionally. It felt sincere. But the facts are still there. He was on a dating app, speaking to not one but *two* different women and matching with a bunch of them. I honestly can't even begin to imagine his thought process when he was doing this. Although I do believe that he hasn't cheated on me, there is part of me that wonders how long this would have gone on and whether he would eventually have cheated had I not spotted that notification on his phone. 

I told him to leave and I've been thinking about this all day. I can't focus on work. This entire situation has been eating away at me. In part I'm angry and upset that he would do this and in part I'm wondering if maybe he's right. Maybe this isn't that bad and I'm just overreacting. He showed me everything. Tinder messages, text messages, photos, etc. There was nothing to prove that any cheated had been planned or had already occurred. He showed me his emails as well. But again, there's no way of knowing whether it would have happened had I not found out one week in. 

If he doesn't want to be with me, then he should just say that. Don't go on dating apps when we're still wearing our rings and cuddling and sleeping in the same fucking bed. And especially don't gaslight me when I find out what's going on. As weird as it is to say, that's the part that bothers me most. Had he apologized to me right away and explained everything in the moment, I would still feel upset, but nowhere near as upset as I feel now ... knowing that his first fucking instinct was to gaslight me into thinking I was the one doing something wrong. 

He has never done anything even close to that before. I wouldn't have married him if he had. Our communication has always been so good. This situation is confusing for me. And of course, I asked him if he still wants to be with me and he said he ""obviously does"" and that he will ""never do something so thoughtless and cruel ever again"". I don't know what to think, let alone what to do. 

Is this as bad as it feels? There was no cheating, but there was at least the beginning stages of what could have turned into cheating, and of course, some gaslighting as well. 

**tl;dr** He apologized to me and explained everything to me the next morning. Although no cheating has occurred, there was still a week of swiping around a dating app. I don't know what to do. His apology and explanation felt sincere to me. But this is still bad and so unexpected coming from him of all people."
"Boyfriend [25M] is upset because I [21F] let him sleep with me


We're both christian, early 20's. We met at a church-thing about a year back. I grew up with it and have had some back-and-forth, he decided on his own as an adult. 

He has been clear on waiting till marriage since the first time it came up, though he only feels that way about PIV-sex. I have felt differently, as I believe that if other stuff is fine, why is that one thing different, in this modern age of easily available contraception? (To become one=babies, no?)

Scripture is not making anything clearer when read in the context of the full chapters and considering the ways one could translate the original greek, but I try to respect his wishes. That is what he believes and wants, and that is okay. His body, his decision. 

We did however slip up and do the thing. It was wonderful. We talked about it after, I felt weirder about it than him, he says no worries, god forgives, but let's not do it again.

After three occurences of doing it again and a pregnancy scare I decide we get some condoms, as I believe it's better to take precautions if we can't keep our filthy paws off eachother anyway.
This leads to several more doing-it's in a rather short time. 

After a while boyfriend gets upset. He feels that I am letting him, or making him, sleep with me and that I should be stopping him. The condoms are like me saying ""go ahead"" instead of me helping in the effort of us waiting.

Am I doing a crappy job at respecting my boyfriends convictions? Should I just get on the pill behind his back? Would that be any better, or just ten times worse?

....

TL;DR:
Boyfriend wants to wait until marriage, I have aggreed. There has however been slipups, and I put down foot and bought condoms, this lead to more frequent slipups. 
Boyfriend is now hurt about lack of support in the waiting-decision."
"Parents (60/MF) in heavy CC debt, want me (20's/F) to clear debt by buying their house


**INTRODUCTION**

Hello I'm new to Reddit, I'm sorry if I posted in the wrong place. I couldn't find a subreddit for family finance.

I'm in my 20's and renting a place. Currently I can support my own lifestyle with the occasional splurge. I don't own a home yet but plan to in maybe 5 years when I want to start a family.

&amp;#x200B;

**THE SITUATION**

My parents are approaching 60 and have over $300,000 in credit card (""CC"") debt, along with maybe $100,000 outstanding from our family home. They have subscribed to a debt management program that consolidates your debt and pays it off for you, but you'll have to pay a fixed amount each month. There are less than 10 years left. They are living a frugal life and paying off the installments with their salary, which may stop if their employer decides to release them after retirement age.

I need to mention that the $300,000 debt came from being scammed and huge loans to bail out friends that later vanished. So, this didn't happen from irresponsible spending, just my parents misplacing their trust.

**Two years ago, my parents proposed that I ""purchase"" the family home through a housing loan for $400,000. They would use the proceeds to settle their CC debt, and, they promised to pay the monthly installments on my behalf. I'm assuming I would take over the payments once they no longer have an income.** 

I have refused multiple times and suggested that they downsize so the debt would be more manageable. However, my mum had always refuted that the home is nearly paid off, we don't have to go such lengths, and why should we lose our home? But from my understanding how are retirees supposed to pay off the $300,000 then?? :$ If you have no income aren't you supposed to liquidate your assets?

I feel guilty, because I have read heartwarming stories about how some families made do with less just to help out an unfortunate member, and yet I chose to be selfish. I feel conflicted - I mean optimistically speaking it could all go well, but there are so many ways it could go wrong. Buying a house that I cannot afford, losing my ability to get a loan when I really want to settle down, having to care for my parents when they get super old, etc. I am very confused.

If we were talking about $0 retirement funds I could maybe take them in - that's the norm in our society, the issue here is how do we tackle the debt? I can't abandon my parents but I also don't want to ruin my future. 

I also have an unemployed older sibling (30/M) still living with my parents, I don't know if it's relevant.

&amp;#x200B;

**TL;DR: Aging parents have $300,000 CC debt + $100,000 housing loan balance, may get released from employment after retirement age in a few years, wants me to ""purchase"" the family home for $400,000 to pay their debts. Can I hear your story or get some advice for options?**"
"I M (27) broke up with my girlfriend F (24) last week and think I've made a terrible mistake.


Context:

So in the fall I moved to the city to be closer to my now ex girlfriend and to get a new job. I ended up getting my own apartment because our parents are the types that wouldn't pay for a wedding if we ""lived in sin"". Throughout the spring my feelings for her started to fade. I began wanting to play video games with friends more than hang out with her, I just didn't have the spark anymore. There were a number of factors contributing to this. She would tell me it would destroy her if we ever broke up, and every time we had a small fight it would be a huge deal because of her fear of us breaking up. She made some very rude comments about my fitness even going as far as showing me a picture of myself from the previous summer and asking if I remembered when I looked like that. We finally had a big drag out fight about this thanks to me getting too drunk with coworkers and finally unloading it all on her. We had an extremely constructive conversation the next morning and she was gracious enough to keep talking to me after I drunkenly unloaded all that baggage on her in a very rude manner the night before and yelled at her. Once it was out on the table I felt unbelievably better and we were good for a little while.

&amp;#x200B;

Breakup:

Then the lack of a spark came back, I was hanging out with her and not having fun and she could tell and it hurt her. She confronted me about it a couple of weeks ago in tears and asked me to help, but I could only sit there and say I was sorry. She was in tears and I couldn't feel anything. This past weekend I went out with friends and pitched to them the idea of breaking up with her and they all suggested I talk to her about it, but I realized then I wanted them to tell me to pull the plug. I got really drunk that night and was still drunk in the morning and when we got up did it quickly right then and there. She was in tears, and I was too a bit but I was more controlled. I drove her home and made peace with her. I spent the entire break up telling her how amazing she was and that someone else will make her happier than me. She agreed to split. 

&amp;#x200B;

Aftermath:

I got home from dropping her off, shut the door and broke down. I couldn't eat for 3 days, I was beside myself. I missed her and felt so guilty for ending it. I immediately realized how upset I was with where I was at. With my finances, my body, how well I kept my apartment. I realized that since I moved to the city I was happy with myself and she was propping me up, but I was attributing my dissatisfaction to her.  My last break up derailed my life, so I was proactive this time and got in to see a therapist. First session was mainly just catching up as it usually goes with a new therapist. But from being introspective I realize two things. \*\*1. I did nothing to try to save us because I didn't know what to do besides stand there like a jackass and hope I love her again. 2. Most of our problems weren't problems, I was being extremely judgmental and toxic to both myself and her and thinking of everything in the vein of ""if we're married I'll deal with this forever"".\*\* 

&amp;#x200B;

Thinking about it, I think I built her up in my mind to be someone that she wasn't with all my unfair judgments and I projected my unhappiness with myself on to her. I miss her terribly and even if I'm not sure she's the one, I just don't want it to end without me trying. I have another therapist appointment this week and I'm going to get her take on it. But if I still feel this way next week I'm going to reach out to her and see if she'll try couples counseling with me. I don't know if 2 weeks is too soon and I'll be jerking her around, or if I'll be saving her from some agony. 

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR I broke up with my girlfriend, and now realize she was trying everything she could to save our relationship and I didn't put in any effort at all. Is sooner better than later to reach out and ask if we can try couples therapy?"
"I [43M] defended my husband [34M] of almost four years against his family and he’s upset with me


**tl;dr; Last Sunday, my husband and I went to his brother’s for a family dinner after not seeing most of them for 15 years; husband was being laughed at and humiliated, and almost physically taken advantage of, and I came to his defense. He is upset with me now and I don’t think I’m in the wrong, but still want to do my part to resolve the situation.**

I’ve been in a relationship with my husband for 10 years, and we’ve been married for almost four. He has a very complicated and unhealthy relationship with his family. He is the black sheep and it was always obvious that his older brother was the favorite. He was abused by a cousin who was close to his immediate family for years before finally telling his parents, who didn’t believe him. This cousin outed him, and his parents kicked him out and didn’t speak to him for years. They didn’t come to our wedding and only began speaking to him like two and a half years ago. His relationship with his brother is strained.

My BIL invited us to his birthday dinner, saying the whole family hadn’t been together in a long time and he wanted to fix that. My husband had a massive amount of anxiety, as this would be the first time in almost 15 years where he’ll be with every single person who was out of his life again. We’ve had countless conversations about his family, as he feels like he’s to blame for a lot of what happened and for losing contact with many of them. While my situation is nowhere as bad as his, I’ve had my experiences with toxic family members and abuse, as well as working professionally with social workers for a long time. I’ve always been very vocal when it comes to my disgust with them, and tried to convince him not to go to his brother’s dinner. He decided to, in an attempt to bury the hatchet, and asked me to please come. The night before, he kept having panic attacks and throwing up to the point where I thought we wouldn’t go and was begging him not to do this to himself. We went anyway.

The dinner was last Sunday. Everyone there seemed surprised, not necessarily in a good way but also not a bad one, to see him and to see that he brought me along. This was my first time meeting everyone in person. To make a long story short, things started off okay but then my BIL and FIL very quickly began to make jokes and tell degrading stories at my husband’s expense, ranging from his mental health to his sexuality to him “lying” about some of the abuse he suffered. He was clearly uncomfortable with them, and everyone else was laughing like this was some normal thing. I asked what the hell was wrong with everyone. My husband said it’s okay and not to make a big deal about it, but I continued saying I can see why we had stayed out of touch for so long. Things got silent before his brother asked me who I thought I was coming in there and speaking to them like that. We started to go back and forth, when the cousin walked in and apologized for being late.

My husband already had this uneasy, sad look on his face, but when the cousin walked in, his face just fell and turned pale. I asked him if he was okay and he didn’t answer. Everyone started talking and laughing again, and my husband excused himself to go to kitchen. When he left, the cousin was like “what’s up with him” and started cracking jokes, making everyone laugh. I glared at him and he tried to make small talk with me. At that point, most people had started eating and the cousin said he was going to grab something from the fridge. I didn’t get up immediately, but after a few minutes, I decided to go in there too and make sure everything was okay.

In the kitchen, he was talking to my husband who was trying to ignore him. He said something like “Why are you being so weird, I haven’t seen you in forever, just give me a hug”, and he grabbed my husband’s waist, running his hands down his thighs. My husband tried to push him off and asked him to get away from him. The cousin said not until he gave him a hug and I walked in then, saying “he said to get away from him”. The cousin looked surprised to see me and said that’s it’s no big deal, just go sit down. I raised my voice and said get away from him, and he asked what I was going to do. Without thinking, I punched him in the jaw.

He let go of my husband and fell to the floor. My MIL came in and started screaming, which caused more people to come in and see what was happening. The cousin got up and had blood in his mouth and started laughing nervously, saying he was okay, everything’s cool. MIL asked what I did, and I said “what you should’ve done years ago”. The BIL told me to get out and that it was a mistake inviting us. I told him it was a mistake to think that they would’ve ever changed or were actually decent people, they were all abusive and narcissistic pieces of shit. I told them I would get lawyers involved if they ever reached out to my husband or me again. Within the next minute, we were out of that house.

When we got home, my husband immediately went to the bathroom, started crying, and threw up. I asked him to let me in, and he said to leave him alone. He stayed in there for a long time, then went to bed. This whole week, he has been very distant, and hasn’t been eating a lot or sleeping well. I tried to confront him about it on Wednesday, and it led to him getting emotional and shouting (which is very unlike him unless he’s very stressed out or overwhelmed) that he didn’t want to talk about it, I ruined any chance he had at rekindling any relationships, and he wished we just didn’t go. I was shocked and said I defended him while he just sat there and let everyone walk all over him, he didn't even want to be there, and he started crying and saying I didn’t get it, please just stop talking about it. So I left him alone and we haven’t talked about it since.

It’s been almost a week. Things have been tense between us. It’s not bad per say, but there’s definitely an elephant in the room. I’m admittedly shocked and angry that he thinks I ruined things for him. Everyone there was either berating him and laughing about it, or being complicit. His cousin was trying to take physical advantage over him again. I see where I overreacted, especially through the violence. But did he expect me to just watch and play along? It was absolutely disgusting and horrifying to witness firsthand. Worse than how he described it before. What was there to rekindle? His face last Sunday during the whole thing said everything, everyone in his family said what they needed to say. I won’t act like I was some perfect knight in shining armor, but I feel like I’m more in the right for defending him. I don’t know why he’s upset with me. I’m unhappy with the way this whole thing played out and just want insight on how to fix things (with my husband, I couldn’t care less about his family)."
"My [16f] mom [47f] was a victim of crime years ago. My boyfriend [17m] just told me he is pretty sure it was his dad [??m]. We're not sure if we should be up front and tell my family or not.


As I said in the title, my mother was a victim of a violent-ish crime almost ten years ago. Basically she was a desk person at a business that was robbed, the robber forced her at gunpoint (the gun turned out to be fake after the fact) to give him cash and he also threatened people inside with a (also fake) bomb.

The robber was caught but it really messed my mom up for a long time. She was afraid to leave the house for a long time, still won't be near anyone with a gun. 

She is doing much better, but even now she completely avoids the street where it happened.

My boyfriend and I met right at the beginning of this school year. He can be a little hardheaded, but he is a complete sweetheart and I love him to bits. My family likes him as well, my dad has told him before he is welcome over any time and they get along really well.

My boyfriend's dad is in prison. He told me at some point in our relationship that his dad got in trouble for unspecified stuff and was in jail. His mom divorced his dad and she is super sweet (and reverted their names back to her maiden name) so I didn't feel like I ever needed to know more than that.

Today, boyfriend was over at my house for a barbecue. Mom was chatting with another relative about the robbery she was in, boyfriend kind of stopped talking to me and started listening to what they were saying. 

Mom mentioned the name of the place, and my boyfriend broke in ""The one on [street]?"" And mom confirmed. Boyfriend asked how long ago it was and mom told him the year. Boyfriend dropped the convo and was clearly bothered by something the rest of the day. 

When it was time for him to go I walked him out to his car and he told me he had something to tell me. I asked what was up, and he told me he was 99% sure that his dad was the person who robbed my mom.

I wasn't really sure what to say to that, but my boyfriend was very clearly bothered by it. He asked me if I thought he should tell my parents and I told him he wasn't even sure.

Shortly after he left I got a text from him that just said ""yep"".

He called a little bit later and asked if I thought it would be a good idea for him to tell mom. I honestly didn't know. 

There's a chance he and I will last after high school (I know, statistics, you don't need to point it out) and if that happens then it will come out eventually. But is it worth telling her now?

Boyfriend even offered to apologize to my mom, basically just go and tell her he is very sorry for what his dad did to her, etc. Bit we can't decide if that is a good idea or bad one. 

Boyfriend is very troubled by finding this out, and I'm really not sure what to tell him or anyone to make him feel better.

Should we tell mom or let it lie? Is the apology a good idea?

**TL;DR** : Boyfriends dad probably committed a robbery years ago that involved my mom and really traumatized her for a while. Should we tell mom or no?"
"Partner [30M] of 5 years has changed since he started training. I [27F] feel like I'm no longer physically good enough for him


Rys and I have been together for 5 years and up until recently I thought we were strong and still very much in love. We clicked really well from the beginning and were both introverted average nerds. 

&amp;#x200B;

Last year Rys decided to make some changes with exercises mainly that he wanted to start building muscle as he was self conscious about his body. Hes been working with a PT 4x week and attends the gym pretty much daily. Ive been supportive of this even though I loved the way he was from the beginning, I'm all for doing things to make ones self feel more confident/better about themselves. 

&amp;#x200B;

I am active myself but I never got into gym in its strict form the way Rys did. He tried to get me into muscle building but its just not for me. I'm a healthy weight though I'll admit it I'm not exactly toned and do have a bit of a tummy (for reference - my weight is 55kg and height 1.6) 

&amp;#x200B;

So Rys has managed to really transform himself, but Ive noticed hes character has changed along with his body.  

Ive never been into those gym pictures and he knows this. Heck we use to mock those guys who flexed at the gym together. and now hes sending me those pictures telling me that I must be the luckiest. 

&amp;#x200B;

I didnt want to interfere with his new boost of confidence at the start and kind of played into it but 

&amp;#x200B;

hes been making comments on how I need to work harder if I want to keep the catch that he is. He makes fun of my belly if we've just had a meal and its noticeable. Hes pushing me to exercise more, comments on what I eat (even though I actually eat well/balanced diet). All around hes becoming insufferable and rather annoying    


&amp;#x200B;

I finally had enough and told him that he should date someone from his gym if I'm no longer good enough for him. Dont let me hold you back, right. And he says I'm not being supportive of him. 

&amp;#x200B;

Im lost for words and I dont know if Im being too harsh on him. I mean I know he wouldn't leave me over those other girls, I know he still loves me from every little thing he still does and how he still looks at me. and Maybe I'm just being more sensitive because of my own insecurities of not being enough but I don't know. I dont appreciate his comments even if they are just jokes 

&amp;#x200B;

tl;dr : bf has changed since he started working out, hes more insensitive and hurtful and seems to want to change me under the disguise of jokes"
"How do I [21/F] explain to my mom [40s/F] that opening a credit card in my name was out of line?


Earlier today, my mom came into my room and started prattling on about some credit card I should apply for. (I already have a credit card, but I get offers from other banks/companies? occasionally.) I just kinda said ""yeah, yeah"" to her since I was doing something else.

Just now, she came into my room and said ""Oh, by the way, the credit card was approved!"" and I was like ""?? What credit card??"" and she said, ""The one I was telling you about earlier!"" and I was like ""Did you just open a credit card in my name?"" And she was like, ""Yeah, I told you I was going to do that. I mean, it's a great deal. There's no annual fee and you get $200 when you spend $1000."" I mean, whether or not that's a great deal or not is beside the point. I was unhappy that she decided to take matters into her own hands and the fact that she was brushing it off as ""Well, I'm doing you a *favor*"" wasn't really making things any better. I was a bit heated, so I just snapped, ""Well, you can't go around just stealing my identity to open new credit cards."" 

Now she's mad at me for telling her she ""stole"" my identity (specifically with using the word *steal*--I saw her stiffen when I said that), but I'm kind of sick of her constant ""I'm just trying to do nice things for you,"" bullshit. Even my dad will stick up for me when he sees it happening, and is constantly telling her to cut it out. 

How do I explain to her that yes, while my language was harsh, I really did not appreciate what she did? How do I enforce better boundaries in the future?

tl;dr: Mom opened credit card in my name for me because she thinks that's what I need, how do I communicate to her that she should not be doing these things for me?"
"How should I(26f) tell my sister(28f) we don't want her babysitting our kids anymore?


Hello relationships crew! I am hoping you all can help me with a little dilemma.

&amp;#x200B;

I'll start with a bit of background on my sister and my relationship. She, to put it bluntly, is a bit of a mess. She got into a lot of trouble as a kid, always butted heads with our parents, constantlay went out of her way to be a pain in the ass. She made for a pretty stressful household. Now she is way better off than any of us expected. She is the music director for her church, she is working on a horticulture degree, and she's married to a truly amazing man.

&amp;#x200B;

That being said, she still does exhibit the same kind of behavior she did when we were growing up, just adjusted for adulthood. She is still pretty manipulative, terrible with money, selfish, lazy, condescending, the list goes on. I don't mean to make her sound like she's a monster. She really is very kind and caring, and so much fun to be around. I just can only deal with her in relatively small doses.

&amp;#x200B;

So onto my problem. I have 10 month old twins who my sister watches every Thursday while my husband and I are at work. We have an arrangement of different family members (including myself and my husband) watching them every day to avoid outrageous daycare costs in the Boston area. While my boys really do love my sister, there are some issues that have come up:

&amp;#x200B;

\- When we get home in the evening, a vast majority of our weekly groceries are gone. I'm talking donuts (one time a half dozen were gone), entire packages of Oreos, more than 3 single-serve pizzas, drinks (half full containers tossed about the boys' play room), fruit, etc. This is all in just one day! Plus, there is delivery trash all over the apartment, so she orders out as well.

\- This brings me to my next bullet. Trash. Everywhere. We don't by any means keep an immaculate home. We have twin infants. Our house will not be clean for a very long time. But she leaves food and garbage everywhere. She let's the boys drop pieces of their snacks and she just leaves them on the floor. If one of them spits up, she just lets it dry into the carpet. There are dirty diapers all over the living room and the nursery. There is her own food trash everywhere. It's disgusting. We spend every Thursday night deep-cleaning the apartment.

\- Ipay my sister $150 for watching the boys for the day. This was supposed to be for 10 hours of sitting (7 am-5 pm), but lately she has been bringing the boys to my parents' house at around 2pm and sort of pawning them off onto my mother. Then, she wants to leave early but has to wait for me to get home to write her a check. Recently, for this reason, she has requested Venmo. I obliged, but now she wants me to Venmo her $151.50 to cover the service fee. Even though she was the one who requested Venmo rather than paper checks. I refused, and now she is really mad at me. But I'm not backing down on this when she was the one who wanted Venmo in the first place.

\- She frequently calls at around 9 or 10 the night before saying that she can't make it to watch the boys the next day, causing my husband and I to scramble. Most of the time we have to end up using our PTO to stay home with them.

\- This one bothers me the most. One time, my husband and I left for work in the morning but had to turn back around 10 minutes into our drive because I had forgotten my work ID. I ran in to the house and both the boys were laying on the floor crying their eyes out while my sister was sitting on the couch playing on her phone. It wasn't until she realized I was back that she sprung off the couch and started trying to soothe them. Who knows how long that would have gone on had I not come home.

&amp;#x200B;

There is a ton more, but those are the main points. Recently, my husband and I received a recommendation for a daycare in our area. The place is amazing, we know a couple of the parents who bring their kids there, and it is extremely affordable. I toured the place and I just have a really good feeling about it. My husband is on board too. We are wanting to put them in Tuesday-Thursday. The issue is, I know my sister relies very heavily on the money we pay her. Plus she lives almost 2 hours away and rarely sees the boys outside of her sitting days. But her reliability and trustworthiness has completely tanked in our eyes.

&amp;#x200B;

She requested every other Thursday, but I think we need to just end her regularly sitting. Please, how do I break it to her without breaking her heart?

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR - My sister is a mess and hardly takes care of my kids while she babysits them. How do I tell her we're choosing daycare over her?"
"Want to ask roommate [24F] for her dog. Would you give yours up for the right price?


A bit of background story for context:

I accepted a job offer across the country and have really enjoyed spending so much time with my roommates dog. I'm quite attached to him. The thing is she really neglects him and it breaks my heart to know that once I leave he's going to spend the majority of his life in a cage. She has a very active social life whereas I'm a homebody and when she first moved in I noticed she keeps him in the cage for 12 hours or more per day while she's out. I've seen him have accidents in the cage and sit in his own urine because she will be gone for long periods of time and will forget to take him out. She's never home and he gets very little attention from her. 

I took it upon myself to start taking care of him and it's to a point where I take him out 3 times a day and feed him all his meals. I play with him, I snuggle him, take him for walks, he even sleeps in my bed with me. I'm really sad about leaving him behind. I see him as my baby. 

I guess what I ultimately want to ask is would you part with your pet for $1000? It doesn't seem like she's very attached to him to begin with and I really want to save him from living the way he used to with her. I'm a very anxious person and am afraid to have the conversation with her because I feel like it may be a touchy subject. 

Tl;Dr is there any amount of money that you would give up your pet for? Is it even worth asking? How do I even go about having the conversation?"
"My [22/F] mother [46/F] lied about my father [42/M] my whole life. I'm so depressed I don't know what to do. Graduating very soon and I don't even want to go.


I was raised by my mother as my biological father was never in the picture. I didn't see him much after 14 and while I get cards and gifts from my father for all the major events (and my paternal grandparents) he stayed away. I always had angry feelings/emotions around my father, he was never there. I knew him as the guy who wrote nice things in a card and sent me money. That was it. 

&amp;#x200B;

The last time I remember seeing my father was when I was 14. We got into a fight about something and I told him I was done visiting with him, I hated him and his whole new life and never wanted to see him again. I protested visiting him and my mom very calmly supported me. After that, an arrangement was worked out and the result was I never saw my father again. My mother held a lot of very negative emotions about my father. He never really paid child support and he was often in court with my mother. The courts consistently screwed my mother over and never adjusted his child support payments and helped us. It's why I majored in women's study and am going into social work. My mother and I scraped by  my whole life, my mother always struggled and drinking has become a bigger part of her life. I'm in massive student debt because I took out huge loans to attend a good, albeit private, university. I did it to help women like my mom who've been screwed by the system and so many people in life. 

&amp;#x200B;

A couple of weeks ago I got an email from my father who asked about me. He semi-regularly emails, usually photos and things along with an update on his life/his family and a lot of inquiries about me. I haven't generally responded. This time he asked about student debt and if he could help. Selfishly I responded and admitted I was deep in debt. He offered to help and I suggested we meet because I wanted to ask him why he never tried. 

  
Three weeks ago, we met at a restaurant and he was so emotional. He kept touching (holding my arm and hand) me and saying that he missed me. He didn't bring his wife/kids/parents and we talked. It was so odd to see how alike we are. He's a lot taller than I remember. Bigger, too. We talked and he was very funny. We met again on the following day (Saturday) (this was two weeks ago). This time he brought a lot of pictures, papers and all kinds of things. I asked him why he didn't stay in my life and he told me that I hated him. I started to remember how mad I was he wasn't with my mom, how we were unhappy. We rehashed a lot of stories about things that ""happened"" that he would show didn't happen, or were seriously warped by my mother. It turns out that he &amp; my grandparents paid child support, in advance, every month but my mother had squandered it. We were poor because my mother blew it. When asked why he wasn't supporting her through spousal support, he pointed out she got remarried - she's been married 3 times. The court visits were spurious lawsuits my mother hoped would net more money. 

&amp;#x200B;

My father told me that my mother got pregnant after coming on to him knowing he came from money. After I was born, she made it impossible to have time with me and when the courts sanctioned her, she poisoned me, gave me false stories. We wound-up talking for hours, I cried most of it. I've always had issues with my mother who is very sullen, conniving and an addict. A lot of what my father said was absolutely true, he kept hitting the nail on the head. I felt so angry. 8 years I went without a father, my mother's husbands were all forms of abusive, and I attempted suicide at 17. Suddenly I'm being given a lot of information all at once. This weekend I had a reunion, I met my father's wife and my grandparents (my father's children weren't present). My grandparents were so happy, my grandmother (who is surprisingly spry and young looking - she looks younger than my mother) held on to me for hours. We looked at photos, exchanged stories. My father and grandparents also said they'd cover my educational expenses.  

&amp;#x200B;

This weekend I had a BBQ with my father's family, including his kids. My father is a very stable medical professional and has a beautiful home. His wife is lovely and we got to come together and eat and swim. My step sisters and step brothers are much younger than me but really smart and sweet. I really liked meeting them. I hated to leave them at the end of the day and my youngest step brother gave me a great big hug and a kiss. My grandparents drove me home and took me to the grocery store and stocked me up on food and supplies, including cosmetics. It's so nice to have a stocked fridge.

&amp;#x200B;

When I got home, I basically just cried. I woke up and cried most of yesterday morning. I visited my mother in the afternoon and confronted her with everything. She immediately started to fake cry (think Reese Witherspoon on Friends) and then very calmly admitted that she just plainly hated my father and I should do what she thinks is best. I pointed out flaws in her story and got so mad, but she stayed extremely calm. She said she did what was right and that my father used his money against her. When I said I knew she received child support all along and demanded to know where it went (I used to attend school in clothes that stunk, clothes that had holes and were from Goodwill. I used to receive free food from the school because I missed so many meals... where the fuck did the money go?!). Instead, she responded by saying that if I kept after this, or kept seeing my father, she *won't* attend my graduation. They ""screwed"" her and she doesn't think I should have them there.

&amp;#x200B;

I went home and basically cried until I fell asleep. None of my friends know what's going on. I'm so worried about telling them/people around me that I don't know what to say. I don't know where to turn. I'm not even sure what I should do. I'm on campus trying not to cry and every breath feels like it's going to explode out of my chest and into another fit of tears. 

&amp;#x200B;

How do I handle this with my mom? How do I handle this with my dad? I'm supposed to vacate my apartment and return to my mother's place until fall. I don't even want to look at her and I have till the end of the week. 

&amp;#x200B;

tl;dr my mom got pregnant to use my father's money. She poisoned me against him and for 8 years we didn't speak. We reconnected and I suddenly don't know what to do as everything my mother said was a lie. I'm incredibly depressed and have cried non-stop for a couple of days. I am supposed to move back in with her in a few days."
"I [51/M] wanted to go out with my GF [46/F] today but she said she was busy; just ran into her in a nightclub.


TL;DR: My GF and I haven’t seen much of each other lately; we had an opportunity to spend sometime together this weekend and she said she was busy.  Decided to go out by myself and ran into her.

First some background; my GF and I have been dating for 10 months now and due to the fact that we both have small children and share custody with our exes we don’t see each other often (like once or at the most twice a week).

That’s never been a problem because for both of us our kids are a priority and we accepted that.  We made it work and we also started going out with our kids and they get along well.

A few weeks ago my girlfriend was told that she was going to be laid off and she told me that she needed to focus on finding a new job and couldn’t see me as often.  

I offered to help her with her job search, but she said it was not helpful and that it was something she needed to do herself (I posted on this sub about that, so check my post history if you want some background on that).

About three weeks ago she found a new job and she starts next week; I did not ask if we could go back to see each other regularly, as she told me that she had a lot of reading to do for her new position.  I was hoping that as we had a long holiday weekend and our kids are spending it with our exes (a rare occurrence) that we would spend some time together.

We went out during the day yesterday and I asked her if we could catch a movie or dinner, but she said she had some reading to do.  I took her to her house (her mom lives with her) and we chatted for a while and then I went home.

She texted me that maybe we could watch a movie or something (I didn’t respond as I was sleeping already);  today I texted her and asked her if we could see each other today and she replied that she still had some material that she needed to go through.

So I decided to go out dancing (we’re both into ballroom dancing) by myself, which is a common occurrence for both when one of us is busy with the kids.  To my surprise my GF is already there with her girlfriends.

I act cool and wave at her and sit at the bar; she comes and says hello and she tells me that so and so is with her and we both behave like nothing is happening but to be honest spending the night there is very awkward as all I can think is that she couldn’t find time to go out with me but she went out with her friends.

Why not tell me that instead of “I’m busy”?  So I left.  I got a text from here asking me where I was, to which I did not respond.  So my question is, what am I facing here?

When she told me that she couldn’t see me because she wanted to focus on her job hunt my first reaction was “we’re in this together and I want to help”; she and this sub told me that it was better if I gave her some space and I took the advice.

Now this and I’m thinking that maybe she wants to move on if we’re at the point that she can’t be honest with me when she prefers to hang out with her friends and not me. 

Am I overreacting?  Should I let this slide?  Or is it time to have a serious talk with my GF?"
"My (F23) work mentor (M35+) to whom I owe my job was just fired from our company. Should I reach out ?


(TL;DR at the end)

I started at our small company 6 months ago, coming in first as an intern straight out of uni. This guy (M35+) found my CV in the massive pile of internship candidatures they have, contacted me for the internship, interviewed me, then chose me for the role and was an amazing mentor to me during my first few months at the company. He's also the one who talked our boss into hiring me full time, which is amazing (it's my dream job, I love it). So I pretty much owe him my job.

Only, I came back from a weeklong holiday abroad this week to find his desk empty. I asked my colleagues and they told me he had been fired last week because our boss thought he wasn't working well enough and apparently had been missing work without any excuses too often. I was a bit shocked, because our company is very 'chill' and I wasn't expecting this could ever happen. Then I felt very sad for him because I know he has a wife and a very young child (6 month old baby, I met them both once) that depend on him. I'm not questioning why he was fired, but I also now have a weird survivor's guilt because I owe him my job that I love and it looks like I'm here to stay while he's lost his job (I have good performances reviews and I work in an area very different from my mentor's where the company desperately need help). 

He hasn't contacted me about it, but I want to get in touch to thank him for everything he did for me at the company and maybe offer help babysitting sometimes if he needs it (we'd talked about it before, I'd offered to help if he needed a night off because why not, seemed like a nice thing to do). But at the same time it feels a bit insensitive to me to be like ""thank you so much for getting me this job blabla !"" when he was just fired (and from I've heard he was quite angry about it).

What do you think ? Should I just not contact him and let him forget about it all ?

Thanks !

TL;DR : guy who basically hired me and mentored me just got fired from our company. I want to get in touch to thank him for all his help but it feels insensitive ?"
"My [23F] mother [49F] is sad and lonely, but doesn’t understand that her personality pushes people away


 

My mother has always been a.. difficult.. person. She used to be very explosive, insisted that she was always in the right, everyone else was just being idiots. Everything had to be done exactly how she wanted it and if not, she screamed at me and my father. Obviously, we weren’t exactly on the best terms and I mostly just feared and resented her. There were good times too and sometimes she could be normal or even nice &amp; funny, but it all depended on her mood.

My father died when I was 14 in an accident which was obviously traumatic. For a while my mom seemed to go completely crazy, threatened suicide and screamed at me more than ever before. After the worst was ‚over‘, our relationship began to improve. She now treated me more as an adult. She was still controlling and negative however.

As I became grew up and moved out, she tried to stay controlling, but I got better at just ignoring her and removing any influence she still had over my life. This produced a few more arguments, but we slowly arrived at the point where we are on ‚civil‘ terms and she largely keeps out of my decisions. However she is still ultimately kinda draining to be around. In the last years I’d visit home for holidays and her birthday, but more because I felt like I should than actually wanting to. We are very different people and while we can occasionally get along really well, I don’t really like staying around her for multiple days at a time.

It has become quite obvious in the last years that she is lonely and not very happy. She did get a boyfriend a few years ago but they also seem to argue often and it’s clear she’s not really happy with him and just stays because she can’t find anyone else (she has pretty much said that to me directly). Many of her friends have turned away from her and tbh I think after my father’s death, many of them only stayed in contact out of guilt anyway. My mother just isn’t a pleasant person. She’s negative, critical and headstrong. For example she constantly gets into arguments with all the other tenants in her house about completely unimportant things and thinks she’s in the right. I do feel bad for her because, I mean, she’s widowed and now her only child is barely in her life. I do believe that she has some sort of personality disorder or something, so that she genuinely does not understand why she’s pushing people away and what she could change. But I find that every time I see her, it’s stressful &amp; often a negative experience even if we don’t argue. Her negative attitude tends to drag me down &amp; make me anxious and when I have no contact to her for a longer time, I feel much better about myself.

So.. do I need to feel guilty for largely ‚abandoning‘ her? Is it possible to have a kind of ‚long distance‘ relationship with a difficult parent that is doable for both sides? Idk.

\*\*tl,dr:\*\* My mother is a super negative and difficult person, I kinda don’t like her very much. How to handle this relationship as an independent adult?"
"My (18F) boyfriend (17M) made me feel really weird about something I've always done and I don't know how to feel.


Obligatory note: we've been dating for 7-8 months now and it's our first serious relationship. We're American and that might matter later.

Today there was a rumor started that herpes is going around the school. Someone warned us and we both just kind of chuckled since, you know, we're monogamous. I made a comment that I only kiss him and then also said ""oh yeah and my dad and family and stuff.""

He then made a face of revulsion and said stuff along the lines of, ""What? That's gross/disgusting, that's not normal at all"", even after explaining myself.

Basically, I just give my family members pecks on the lips for greetings or goodbyes. Never lasts for more than a second, it's like the length of a snap. I've always done it, I've never felt uncomfortable unless it was someone I didn't know. I only do it with my dad (did it with my mom before she passed) and grandparents. I've never felt unsafe or like I'm being sexually violated, I've never ever been touched or anything like that.

I didn't feel the need to clarify it as I did above because I thought it would be generally understood that I do not make out with my family members. However, I got a reaction like I'm playing tonsil hockey with my dad on the reg. I just left it at ""I don't make out with my family.""

Is it weird to be insulted over his reaction? I know a lot of people don't kiss their parents and that's fine (he has a bad relationship with his mom), but I still think that being called gross/disgusting was an overreaction. Normally if he makes me upset I just forget about it but this really rubbed me the wrong way.

TL;DR: Told my boyfriend I kiss family members on the lips, he called it gross/disgusting and it made me feel like *I'm* gross/disgusting. Should I talk about this to him? How do I bring it up?"
"I [27/F] have to see my ex [26/M] every day and am getting frustrated with his judgement of my current BF [28/M]. Doesn't listen when I tell him it's really over.


Throwaway as ex reddits a lot. 

My ex and I met in our final year of university where we were both chemistry majors. We had both landed jobs in our field and wanted to eventually return for graduate studies. We dated for three years and in that time, we both worked, studied for the GRE, gained admission to the same program and started studying. We also went from a normal, stable, happy relationship to a complete mess. I hate to save my sanity and I dumped him. We're still in the same PhD program (and will be for at least another few years). The problem stems from the fact that I am in a relationship with someone my ex feels is a personal attack on him. 

&amp;#x200B;

My ex boyfriend's father is a renowned chemist and my ex was always around chemists/chemistry. It made sense that he got into that field, but it's clear that it's not what he's passionate about (frankly, I don't think he really has *any* passions, sadly). I have always loved the field and want to be involved knowing that I'll probably never get a tenure-track teaching job. My goal is to work in labs and to teach classes where/when I can. There are a lot of jobs I can do and I know I won't be making a huge amount of money, but I love the field. We bonded over chemistry and despite being very different people and what I thought was a good, strong relationship. He's a lot more introverted, quiet and serious where I'm outgoing and very bubbly. He has issues about his size - he's only about 5'8 (I'm just a smidge shorter at 5'6) and a thin guy. We're both fairly athletic, but I do it to keep fit and he does it to get out his emotions. Ex lacks confidence and would see anything that I did to enrich myself or learn something new as a rejection of him, that I somehow think I was smarter or ""better"" than him, he would get very defensive when I would attend a lecture or take one of those classes. Current boyfriend is the opposite - he readily admits he knows nothing of chemistry and frames it that we have very different professional interests/skill sets but that doesn't make one of us better/smarter, just different. I think that's a healthier way to approach it. 

&amp;#x200B;

Anyway, ex has struggled with personal issues and he deals by not dealing. After our first year in our program we were all told of internship, lab exchange and professional development opportunities we should take advantage of knowing how hard the academic market is. Most of us took almost all of the options available. I took professional training courses, took  career workshops and did an internship/exchange. Ex did nothing - he thought it was all too silly and didn't do any of it. He just tinkered away on his project and doing his lab work and never bothered. Last summer I went to New York City for a summer exchange where I worked for a company half the week and in a lab half the week, it was amazing! Before I left I attended a start-up night where I met people from the business and engineering schools. It's where I met James - current BF. We were seated together and I learned his was an MBA-MPA candidate and had impressive experience and was also going to NYC for an internship. We agreed to meet for coffee in NYC. 

&amp;#x200B;

Ex became really upset that I was going. He felt that it wasn't warranted and that I was ""abandoning"" him; I told him he could come, take the bus/train to NYC and see me anytime he wanted and we'd keep in touch. The summer was tough, I was having a great professional opportunity mired because he was also so annoyed with me. I felt like I was his psychologist. He had become someone who was angry all the time and very dubious of me. He never believed when I said I wasn't seeing other people or cheating, and he frequently asked me. I felt like his caretaker and less like his girlfriend. He was always sulking and was not doing anything. He visited me a few times in NY - he only worked a few days a week and could easily come more often but only made it twice the whole summer. When I got back home, the apartment we shared was filthy. He hadn't cleaned it once in 3 months. It was full of dirty, grime and old food containers. Laundry hadn't been done since I left and was disgusting. I was at my limit. I told him he needed to clean this up and get help, but he refused. He kept saying that I was interested in other men and that I had probably even cheated while in New York and that it was his lot in life. I ended it right there. I had enough. I moved out of the sty, stayed with friends and got my own place. 

&amp;#x200B;

I think my ex thought this was temporary and I'd come to my senses. He would occasionally ask me to talk about things and so we ""could work on us"" and wasn't hearing that it was over. He'd ask me to lunch or dinner or ""assume"" we had plans together when it was clear we were broken up. Through coincidence, I met up with James at a similar event night where we had met the first time. Nothing happened, but we saw each other for coffee thereafter and the attraction was very strong. James is the opposite of my ex - he's very driven and ambitious; he has a plan and knows how to make is way there. We also share a lot of interests. Ex's favorite activity was to do nothing: Go to a museum, sit and comment on the people who walked by. Ex lacked ambition, motivation and drive. James doesn't lack that. He's also a lot more upbeat and doesn't think that every set back/issue/obstacle is some cosmic force screwing him over. We started dating in October and kept it very quiet. I told my ex sometime in the spring that I was seeing someone else and that it was getting more serious and he should know. 

&amp;#x200B;

He immediately accused me of picking the opposite of him - James is very tall, has a full head of hair (James is a ***very*** hairy person in general) and is very driven. Ex saw it as an attack *on him* rather than a new relationship and is convinced we had sex during my time in NYC. I saw James twice in NYC - once for coffee and once for a sandwich as we worked near each other. The last 3 months have become incredibly difficult. We work in close proximity and it's been infuriating listen to the ex wallow, make sarcastic comments about relationships or how ""the only sex he'll have again is if he pays for it."" He still thinks ""there's a chance"" for us. I'm not good at confrontation and if I reported him to the professors, they'd boot him from the program and he'd be screwed. I am not a wizard with handling these kinds of situations and need help in conveying reality to my ex and getting him to back off while also creating a situation where I can feel comfortable showing James where I work/what I do. 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm not sure how to handle this, but I'm growing fed-up of having to manage my ex and want to sort this out once and for all. I feel like meeting him for dinner/lunch would be a mistake but the words I use don't seem to convey the reality of the situation. 

&amp;#x200B;

tl;dr Ex is happy being unambitious and angry about life. He is difficult and as a result we weren't compatible. We broke up and he doesn't seem to accept that there isn't a future and swings between seeing if we can work ""on us"" to making sarcastic, pitiful comments about how his life is ruined/won't ever find love/was burned by ""another girl"" (me). Need help managing this."
"My [23/f] relationship with my husband [25/m] has become essentially void of intimacy and affection. I finally got answers about why and I don't know what to do with them.


The past two days have honestly been an absolute wreck. I'm very stressed and sleep deprived so I'm going to start at the beginning and try to articulate this properly. This is also going to be long because I really need to get all this out. It's been a hard several months. 


My husband and I have been married for two years, dating for three years prior to that, and have been friends for a decade. When we first started dating, we had a lot of sex. Every time we saw each other, we would have sex. Intimacy outside the bedroom was fantastic, always holding hands, kisses, passing touches while doing our own thing. All typical of the honeymoon stage. Unfortunately during the early stages of the relationship, he cheated on me multiple times. We stayed together despite it and just tried our best to move on. He struggled with undiagnosed and untreated bipolar disorder for years (just recently got a diagnosis) so honestly the early years of our relationship were really rough. There was a lot of anger and manipulative tactics from him, that I admittedly did not respond to in an appropriate way either. We are both in therapy now and have made a lot of strides and have a healthy relationship now. However I do still struggle with thinking about how bad things used to be.


Now that the back story is out, I can move to the current issue. Eighteen months ago, we had our daughter. Naturally, intimacy died down a good bit because we were sleep deprived and stressed constantly. We still held hands, cuddled, showed random displays of affection, and had sex about once or twice a week. Which was fine with us. That stayed consistent for several months and I'd say things were pretty good.


At the end of last year, I was put on a medication that is very notorious for weight gain. I put on about twenty pounds, despite eating very healthy and exercising daily. This was stressful because my husband used to be very very into ""fit girls"" and even when I was 100lbs, still pushed for me to get abs/a big butt/be more fit. So it made me very self conscious over it. However, if anything, our sex life became even more active. Until it just didn't anymore. Four months ago, I noticed that suddenly my husband wasn't really receptive to my attempts to initiate sex or even simple things like rubbing his back while he sat on the couch. He just didn't seem very ""there"". At first I just chalked it up to stress and made a point to continue attempts at intimacy regardless. After all, part of a relationship is carrying more weight when your partner is struggling.


After about a month of me trying and him not responding, I brought up the conversation to him. I told him I didn't know what was going on but I was concerned because he seemed detached and not as affectionate seemingly out of nowhere. He got kind of defensive, which I didn't respond well to and got defensive back. It turned into an argument where I was grasping at straws, trying to understand what was happening, and he was saying hurtful things just out of anger. At one point, he tells me thaty weight gain was the only issue and that he didn't enjoy sex anymore. It hurt, especially because I ""bounced back"" after having a baby and even though I've gained weight due to the meds (that I am still desperately trying to lose), I wear it well and am healthy. That unfortunately made me shut down, especially as I have a history of eating disorders that he is well aware of, and I just spent the rest of the night crying by myself. The next day, we talked, and he confessed that what he said about my weight was complete bullshit and he just said it to be hurtful and ""win"" the fight. It sucked but he apologized and we just sort of moved forward. He said he'd work on being more affectionate and to just give it time.


Another month passed and nothing had changed. If anything, he had gotten more distant. We went from sex once a week to every other week. The only real physical affection was a hug when he came in from work and a goodnight kiss, like clockwork. There would still be occasional sprinkling of affection but it was rare. When we had the first conversation/argument over this, I made a goal to continue to try and keep up with intimacy. I decided that twice a week, I would try to initiate sex and I would be affectionate to him really at any chance I was given, even just a simple hand on his waist when walking by him. Just small shows of love. The sexual advances were almost always turned down, which was fine. It would be greeted with a ""okay babe"" and I'd just move on. Sometimes I'd be a little bummed out but I'd never pressure him or make him feel bad about it.


I brought it up again, and it was a more calm discussion than the last time. I just told him that I felt that things had actually gotten worse instead of better and that I was concerned about him. Told him that if something was going on, I was here to listen. Encouraged him to talk with his therapist about whatever was bothering him to help him get through it. He told me that nothing was wrong, he was just in a funk. Said he hadn't been sleeping well (he's getting a sleep study done soon but has had issues sleeping well his whole life) and that he didn't realize he wasn't being ""present"". During this time, he also started becoming emotionally detached. Our daily interactions felt very rehearsed. He'd text me on his lunch break, we'd basically have the same conversation each day, he'd come home from work in the evening, we'd sit at the table and I'd listen to him tell me about his day, he'd shower, then we'd go to bed. On weekends when he's off, things would be a little better. Sometimes we'd go out or do things as a family, but it started to feel more and more like I was hanging out with my best friend as opposed to my husband. At this point I was starting to get burnt out from trying and trying to get our intimacy back but I kept trying.


Now fast forward to about a week ago. Nothing has changed. He still insisted nothing was wrong or going on. I am feeling very dejected and lonely on a daily basis because my husband has turned into my roommate. We've had sex four times in the past two and a half months. (I want to interject and say I am very into sex when we have it. I love foreplay, I'll do any position known to man, I dirty talk, I'll indulge in almost any kink. So it's not like it's ""in the dark no eye contact missionary"") I'm kind of at the point where I'm losing hope to try anymore and just willing to accept that, for whatever reason, intimacy is just not an active part of my marriage. Two days ago, I woke up with it weighing heavy on my heart. I was not in a good mood and unfortunately it was obvious. My husband asked why I was in a bad mood, so I told him. I told him that I felt like he had checked out of the marriage. Like he didn't enjoy being around me or being intimate with me and that I've tried to get to the bottom of it but nothing has seemed to work. I explained that I was beginning to think there was something wrong with me that was making me undesirable and that I was scared that he was keeping some big secret from me about why he's been so distant. This led to things getting heated and him getting defensive and it kind of went off the rails for a while. Once we both calmed down, he told me he would tell me what was going on. So I thought ""thank God, finally I can know what's been going on with him and we can tackle it together!"". So I'm prepared for him to drop some huge bomb on me, ready to work through whatever it is.


And he tells me that the reason he's been distant and unaffectionate is... He's just had other things to worry about other than our relationship. I'm kind of dumbfounded at this point because first off, our relationship will always be one of my top priorities, and second, we don't really have other things to worry about. When I asked if he could tell me what the other things are, he said he was worried about our vehicle situation. That confused me because we are privileged enough to have two working vehicles, neither of which we have to make payments on. Neither have any immediate mechanical issues. Both are, all things considered, in working condition. So I press, and he tells me it's because he wants better vehicles. Which, okay, I understand, but we're not in a position to get another vehicle right now, which we have already discussed at length. So now I'm trying to process how my husband has been basically absent for almost four months, all due to the fact that he doesn't like the vehicles we have. Or because he can't make time for me? Or both? Okay, we move forward because at least I have an answer I guess? He agrees to work more on being more affectionate and present, we hug, we go to bed.


I wake up the next day (yesterday), ready to just move forward and hope for the best. We have a pretty good day, go swimming at my moms house, he's been more affectionate that usual, awesome! I'm feeling as hopeful as I guess someone can in my situation. Then on the ride home, somehow sex gets brought up in conversation, and he tells me that evidently the only reason he has sex with me lately is because I've been guilt tripping him. Which immediately makes me feel absolutely horrible. He tells me that he's only been saying yes because he doesn't feel like he can say no. So now I'm in complete panic mode because I feel like some sort of monster. I'm desperately trying to think of what I could have done to make him feel this way, absolutely hating myself. Even posted on reddit, desperate for advice. Deleted the post because I didn't want people to know how awful of a person I was. It's important to note that I have been a victim of sexual violence several times in my life, so to hear that I was essentially coercing him into sex and making him feel like he couldn't say no was absolutely sickening. I was almost sick to my stomach, thinking that I was some sort of abuser.


I finally get my shit together enough to ask him if he could tell me what I've done to make him feel that way so I could better understand it. And then he tells me that once or twice I've seemed ""kinda bummed"" after he turned down sex and that he ""didn't want to set me off"" by saying no. I have literally NEVER gotten upset or mad at anyone for not wanting physical contact. Not even close. Have I been a little sad over it? Sure. But I have never pushed it once someone made it clear they weren't into it. I asked for clarification, if he felt I was guilt tripping him (so doing it intentionally) or if he just felt guilty about not wanting sex. He told me that he felt guilty for not wanting to have sex but that ""he doesn't know who gave him that guilt"" and that ""for all he knows, I could be making him feel guilty."" So now I'm more confused and still kind of disgusted with myself. He tells me that, while he sometimes enjoys it, he just does it so that he doesn't have to ""end up having this exact conversation"". Which absolutely kills me because I hate that he felt it was easier to just have sex with me than to talk to me. And it makes me (selfishly) feel undesirable and unwanted, since evidently there hasn't been any actual sexual attraction from him, just guilt.


He also tells me that being affectionate towards took ""every ounce of energy that he had"" and that it was why he was so tired all day. So I guess that made me feel unlovable, like it was some draining chore to be with me. And I know that's selfish because this is about him and his issue. But I just want to be honest, that's how it made me feel. At this point the conversation just sort of desolved and he went to bed. I stayed up way too late, crying and binge watching Netflix, because honestly I feel heartbroken. He keeps telling me that either we fix things or we get a divorce. That's his answer to almost any issue. But it's starting to feel like his version of ""fixing"" things is me just getting over them and learning to live with them. He tells me I should just be happy that he's not a rageaholic anymore than that we're not having huge fights anymore. And I am happy that things aren't like that anymore. But sometimes it feels like we have the same issues, just calmer. I'm dreading him texting me on his lunch break. I'm dreading him coming home. It's easier to feel alone when you're actually alone. Feeling alone when you're inches from your spouse makes it feel like there's a black hole in your chest.


I don't know how to fix this. I'm too embarrassed to seek advice from any friends or a close family member. I don't want anyone to know that I spend my days feeling unwanted and lonely. I can't help but feel like a failure, like I should have done something better or different and I wouldn't be in this situation. Even if he suddenly goes back to normal, how do I get over the fact that my husband flat out told me that he just doesn't have time for me? Or knowing that every time we've had sex has simply been out of obligation, not desire? How do I enjoy his touch when I know that it takes all his energy to do it? Or do I just be grateful that I'm getting those things, even if they're not coming from the right place? I'd give anything in the world to have my loving marriage back.


Tl;dr husband has become increasingly distant for months. Finally got answers from him as to why and it boils down to him not having time for me, having sex out of guilt and obligation, and that affection requires too much energy. Don't know how to come back from this or how to fix it."
"My [18F] Boyfriend [18M] of 5 months said ""ching chong"" as a joke


I'm Asian, and my boyfriend is white. I'm proud of my heritage and I take ANY type of racist jokes seriously. My boyfriend was a lowkey douche when I met him and he knows that I don't tolerate racism.

&amp;#x200B;

We were watching a movie together and he said ""ching chong"" as a little Chinese girl was speaking. I gave him a disapproving look and said ""don't say it again"".

&amp;#x200B;

In less than a few seconds later, he said it again.

&amp;#x200B;

Because I grew up in a Chinese speaking household and kids in my elementary school used to joke around with ""ching chong"" and ""ling ling"", I became furious. Gave him the silent treatment for the rest of the hour and basically told him to get out of my house. For the rest of the hour he kept apologizing and kissing me but there's no real sincerity behind it. I'm still mad and teary at him for being so immature, but I don't know if I did the right thing?

&amp;#x200B;

Honestly why am I dating him even though there are other guys out there who are so much sweeter and more sincere?

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR! Boyfriend said ""ching chong"" and I'm angry as hell."
"My boyfriend(26M) and I(22F) recently got kicked out of our living situation, and our daughter and I have had to come live with my dad.


I’m just looking for some advice. So recently, my boyfriend and I along with our 18mo old daughter made the move back to our home state with little to nothing. I didn’t want to move this way, but that’s how things ended up. My boyfriend’s sister offered to let us live with her for 6 weeks until we had enough money for a place of our own. 

Things were going great up until recently, they got into an argument and she kicked us out of the house. My boyfriend packed up my car and told me to go stay with my dad for the time being. My daughter came along with me of course, but he stayed with his brother. 

The next day my dad and his wife confronted me and told me they think it would be a good idea for me to stay with them until I could get back up on my feet and have the money to move into a place on my own. The only problem is they don’t want my boyfriend coming along, because he’s jobless at this time. He also doesn’t have a drivers license, mainly because he’s never wanted to get one. 

I explained to him that me staying with my dad would be the best option for our daughter, but he tells me I’m giving up on our family and don’t live him anymore. That’s not true, I just think our daughter deserves some stability in her life. My dad told me he’d help with my finances while I live with him as long as I get a job. My daughter could go to my sister’s daycare center, and she’d be very well taken care of. 

I just keep carrying this guilt because now my boyfriend doesn’t have a place to live. Some of his other family members have offered him a place to live, but he says he doesn’t want to be a burden on them. I’ve told him that once I save up money we could move in together again, but he keeps telling me that it will be too late for him then. I just want him to prove to me he is capable of providing for my daughter and I, because he hasn’t been able to show me that yet and we’ve been together 3 years. 

TL;DR I need advice because my boyfriend is guilt tripping me in to staying in a shitty situation rather than allowing the time for us to get our ish together."
"[26F] Starting to realize my “best friends” aren’t really my friends at all


**TL;DR: After a series of (likely too many) events, I’m starting to realize that the people I consider closest to me, the people I’d take a bullet for, are more fair-weather than real friends. I live with them. Not knowing how to proceed.**  

Hi everyone, this is likely going to be a rambling mess as I’m not really sure how to put it into perspective for everyone. I’ll answer any questions to clarify if necessary, but I’m really just hurt and need some advice. 

 I (26F) currently live with my boyfriend (28M) and two best friends (27M and 28M). I can be a bit of a wreck sometimes, and this past year hasn’t necessarily been easy on me, but they have really loved me through it all - or so i was led to believe for a really long time. 

We’ve lived together for about 1.5 years now and it’s been great - had our scuffles and arguments but always came back together as a family, which we lovingly refer to ourselves as. We have issues independently and each individual relationship has its own dynamic, but for the sake of length, I’ll keep it general.   

Over the past 6 months or so, I’ve noticed a change - perhaps it’s just me finally taking the rose-colored glasses off, perhaps something *has* changed - but it’s getting hard to live here. We used to have a really even share of the household chores, the financial burdens (as it pertains to things outside of bills, mostly), and the emotional support of one another.   Lately, it has fallen entirely on me and I’m feeling very taken advantage of - I’ve always been one to “treat” everyone and I’m afraid they’re not only getting too used to it, but not appreciating it anymore. 

Every hungover morning I venture out to pick up breakfast, I get dinners, I let everyone take what’s mine. It hardly, if ever, goes the other way anymore. Worse, it’s becoming *expected,* so now when I dont do it, I’m treated like an asshole. If I dont take care of it, the house never gets cleaned/swept/etc. I tried to stop, to show them I won’t be stepped on, but it went two+ months with literal dirt collecting on the floor without anyone else seeming to care until I did something about it, for the sake of my sanity.    

But worst of all, I’ve found out they’re openly ridiculing me and my boyfriend to their group of friends, sharing things I/we divulged in confidence just to get a laugh, mocking me/us (not far enough away for us to hear) openly - then getting defensive when we get upset because “it’s just playful.” But it’s not. It’s really shitty.  

 I’ve tried talking to them time and time again, but one can’t take criticism and blows up at any hint of perceived personal attack, and the other seems very receptive but is also too validation-seeking to stick to anything for too long if it doesn’t serve him personally. It sucks because i feel I’ve reached the end of the road here, but i have to live with them for the remainder of our lease. I don’t want to be cold and terrible because it’s likely to turn my home life into a living nightmare, but I dont see how I can continue with these relationships. I’m really hurt and feeling very alone.   

Any advice anyone can offer is greatly appreciated. Thank you endlessly in advance."
"[update] He [29M] proposed to me [23F] after four years. I said no. Is there any way to be together?


the last post:  [https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/boemja/he\_29m\_proposed\_to\_me\_23f\_after\_four\_years\_i\_said/](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/boemja/he_29m_proposed_to_me_23f_after_four_years_i_said/) 

&amp;#x200B;

we broke up. The weekend after that post, we met up and talked for a while. I think we both realized what was going to happen and I mean, we both folded each other's clothes to give to each other. I wanted there to be another way, and I know he did too, but I guess we just somehow ended up in two different places. I so badly wanted to be in the same place in life as him. If I could take a pill and be there, I would take it. But I guess it's like we were walking up this big staircase and he reached the top but I couldn't make myself take the last step. I don't know. We cried so much and he never, ever cries, and it hurt so much to see him like that. He was so kind through the whole thing, even though he didn't have to be. 

&amp;#x200B;

It has been a few days now and I vacillate between feeling like it was the right thing and being at peace with it to not knowing what I'm going to do without him in my life and doubting myself. I can't imagine ""moving on"", it feels like forgetting my best friend. Like, if the way I loved him wasn't enough, how will I love anyone enough? Uhg. I guess if we're meant to be with each other, it'll happen, it just can't be right now. 

&amp;#x200B;

Anyways, with the cry girl stuff aside, I think I'll be okay. Just moving along. Thanks to the people who offered me advice in my last post, I really appreciated it. At the very least, I think I've learned that if it's not an ecstatic yes to a proposal, it's probably a sign that something is wrong. I love him, but I know this is for the best. I don't think that feeling would have gone away if I just pushed through and pretended it wasn't there.

&amp;#x200B;

tl;dr: we broke up. Some days I doubt my decision because I love him, but I also realize that a proposal should fill me with joy and not a knot in my stomach. Thanks for the advice folks."
"My (22f) boyfriend (22m) didn’t show up to my birthday party on Saturday.


Here’s a little background. I started dating my boyfriend in January. We’re both in college. I noticed before we started dating that he liked to hang out with his guy friends a lot. I figured once we started dating he would want to hang out with me a little more and I was wrong. We’ve probably hung out one on one maybe 10 times in our entire relationship. He’s ditched me for his friends when we had plans many times. He didn’t make the effort to do anything with me for Valentine’s Day. I had tickets to a baseball game last weekend and I asked him in advance if he could take off work for it and he said he could but didn’t. I’ve communicated many times that I’m not sure I’m a priority to him and he’s said that he has a lot going on mentally. I’ve been understanding and patient as long as possible but I’m not sure that I can do that anymore. Here’s why. My birthday party was on Saturday (memorial weekend). I invited my close friends to all hang out and a lot of them couldn’t come because, well, it was memorial weekend and they all had plans. I told my boyfriend that I was upset that not a lot of people could come and he assured me he would take the day off and be there. Mind you, his birthday is New Year’s Eve so he knows how this feels and even said that to me. My boyfriends car ends up breaking down on Friday and he tells me that he can’t make it to my birthday party because he’s an hour away with no car. I was upset at that, but I understood yet again. Well on Saturday, I found out that he ended up coming to the town where my party was to drop off his car. He didn’t tell me. Didn’t stop by to say hi. I confronted him about it and he told me that he was sorry and that he didn’t think about staying up because he was concerned about how he would get to work on TUESDAY. I told him that I was really hurt and that it was really important to me that he be there. I’ve been thinking about ending the relationship because I’m not sure if it’s the best for my mental health. I’m not sure if I’m being too dramatic? Is this is something that I should be this upset over? Or should I try to be understanding? 

TL;DR My boyfriend didn’t show up to my birthday party and told me it’s because he was an hour away with no car but I found out he was in the same town as my party on the day of my party. There’s a history of him not showing up to things that are important to me, and I think I want to end the relationship but I’m not sure if I’m being too dramatic."
"How can I [M34] talk to my wife [F30] about finances without her getting upset?


Background:

We are new parents. We decided that she would be a stay at home mom when our son was born almost a year ago. Her job didn't pay substantially more than childcare cost and this way she gets to spend lots of time with him. Before our son was born we lived in a 2br/1bath house that I bought before we met. We renovated that to accommodate our growing family. Gained a LOT of equity but doubled our mortgage. We used to live somewhat of a carefree lifestyle as far as spending was concerned. Had plenty of money to go out to eat, vacation, etc with not a lot of planning. Now, without her income, with the added expenses of a child and the higher mortgage, things are tighter, but still very doable.

Challenge:

I am the finance guy. I've always been a saver and had money in the bank just because I like that security more than stuff. She is the opposite. She doesn't have a concept of finance because she never learned it growing up. And now, she'd rather outsource it to me. She racked up credit card debt before we met with living expenses and frivolous crap. All that is paid off now but I don't want to go down that road again. We have joint accounts on everything. However, she doesn't really look at the accounts that much and when she does she doesn't really have the skill set or desire to break down how we are doing overall. So it is left to me to keep our spending/saving in line. My problem is that anytime I need to say, ""we need to keep the credit card bill under $XXX.XX this month"" or that ""we need to not do such and such because we don't have the money"", I get met with frustration, defensiveness and sometimes anger. It stresses me out because I can completely shut spending down and save save save if we get behind but I can't make her do that. I have no problem giving up certain things to help the emergency fund grow. But she gets very frustrated when she has to stop going to Target or skip eating out. It makes her feel like we are poor, which is not the case. I try and reassure her that this is just normal average people personal finance but she doesn't see it that way. It is also left to me to always be the bad guy which is exhausting. Anytime I let up, spending gets out of control. If I don't let up, she's always upset and frustrated that we don't have enough money. I also get chastised for how and when I bring it up. I've tried different settings/tones/timing but haven't found a good combo yet so I really just think she doesn't want to hear about it. I don't know what to do but I'm sure I'm not the only one that has experienced this. Any advice? Thanks in advance.

Also note: I'm not blaming her for spending to much money. How much we spend fluctuates depending on what is happening in our lives. I don't complain about how much she spent on X. I try to look at all of our spending objectively and talk about what is not necessarily within our means or important enough to justify the cost. The conversation usually ends just as poorly as if I had just blamed her though. I just don't know how to not set her off without just not bringing it up at all.

TLDR: Wife gets pissed every time I call out that we are spending too much money but we'd be in debt or broke if I didn't."
"UPDATE: My [21 M] girlfriend [19 F] has made up her mind that she wants to do a nude photoshoot with a 30 year old she met at the bar


Hey everyone, I made a post a few days ago about my gf wanting to meet up with a creep she met at the bar for a nude photoshoot and just wanted to update you guys on what’s happened. 

Link to original post: https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/bulhq8/my_21_m_girlfriend_19_f_has_made_up_her_mind_that/

I knew that there was no chance I was going to let her meet this guy but after reading everyone’s comments I extra extra knew that there was no chance she was meeting this guy. I took my gf to a coffee shop and tried once again to explain how fucked up this all was, how he could be a rapist, involved in sex trafficking, etc. I also said I didn’t want some random guy seeing my girl naked. She told me she appreciated my concern but she found his online portfolio and it was legit. She pulled out her phone to show me and I was surprised. This guy had very professional, nice pictures. Some of the girls were models that now have thousands of followers on Instagram. She also said that I can drive her, go in with her and watch the whole time so there was really nothing to be concerned about. Let me say that I don’t really ever have to have these talks with the gf because she has otherwise good judgment. When I do have these talks with her I find it hard to properly get all my thoughts out and we end up agreeing on what she wants. We left the coffee shop with her still adamant on wanting to go. Let me also clarify that I love my gf and trust her to wear what she wants, to make her own decisions, etc. But not today baby.

I talked to my buddies and we came up with a plan. We all met up and did research on this guy and his company, and found so many ways to debunk his credibility. We went through his “online portfolio” then traced back the pictures to the actual photographers and modelling agencies to prove to her that he’s a big fat liar. We found a government website for our area talking about modelling scams, the red flags, the dangers, and so on, most of which matched this exact situation. We also compiled the best comments from my original thread and included screenshots of those. On my original post, someone mentioned Rodney Alcala, who lured young women into his apartment for the same thing and these girls were never heard from again. We found the sad sad stories of women who have partaken in this type of deal and how terribly it ended. We compiled all our research into a PowerPoint, I borrowed my buddies projector, and it was showtime baby. Got the gf her favourite snacks, put my best suit on, and sat her down for the premier of “107 reasons why modelling with _____ agency is absolutely bonkers”. We went through the presentation and there were so many emotions. We went from her laughing at how I made a PowerPoint, to her crying when I was talking about the women who died in the scam, and her sitting in awe when I was done. She said she was so grateful for me and said she will never ever get herself into something so ridiculous. She hugged me, and when she pulled back I could see she had tears in her eyes. I kissed her forehead and she said “I’m gonna marry you”. That’s my baby.

TLDR; Made a PowerPoint presentation on why she absolutely shouldn’t see this guy and she has no plans of seeing him anymore."
"My [26 F] in-laws, especially mother in-law [50's F] are furious with me for wanting to move back to my country with my son [3 M] because they think it will rob him of staying in touch with his African roots and I'm conflicted.


**Tldr: My in-laws, especially my mother in-law, are furious at my potential decision to move from America back to Australia with my son and want to stop it at all costs lest he loses touch with his racial roots. My husband was African American, and passed away roughly a year ago expectantly. I'm white, and struggling economically but there's support back home.**   


Okay, so this might be a long one.   


For a little bit of backstory, I'm Australian and after graduating university I started travelling the world, staying financially stable as a freelancer whose field allows for working from a computer really easily. After some time in various countries in South America, I met my late husband 'Jeremy' in the US and we fell in love quickly. After being together for a year, I fell pregnant with our son 'Luke' who I love with all of my heart. About this time last year, I lost Jeremy to a freak workplace accident and I don't wan't to go into more detail on that because it pains me to think about. I was obviously devastated, and still am, but my in-laws (especially Jeremy's mother, brother and sister) helped both me and my son through it tremendously- I always felt very accepted by them, and still like a member of the family despite Jeremy having passed.   


I could not afford to stay in the apartment I used to share with my husband for long on one income, even working myself to the bone it was not enough. My mother in-law 'Rita' happily took us in, but there isn't too much space and Luke and I share the bedroom with my five year old nephew 'Dennis'. It's difficult- Luke struggles to sleep in the house because it's quite small for the amount of people living in it (although I know I'm part of the issue and am eternally grateful for the generosity). I'm also having a hard time working, my mental health is on the decline especially because I am very much still in grief. In Australia, I have a strong family/friend network and my twin brother has offered to let us live with him in my city (Melbourne) indefinitely where Luke could have his own room, and I could too. There are also certain government benefits that I could get in Australia that I can't access in America, which would make me and Luke's lives much easier- for instance, I could afford to have him in kindergarten and thus get more work done myself.   


I posed this to Rita, thinking that she'd accept the choice, and she got very angry. Since Luke is an African American, she said I will be stealing his identity from him and white-washing him by taking him with me to live with my white brother, which I did resent but am possibly not understanding well enough. I will always continue to educate Luke about his heritage, important historical figures in Black History and the struggles that were faced (after all, I'm a historian in part). He loves his cousin and his family on his father's side, and I don't want him to lose the chance to see them every day, and I would always visit and have them visit Australia if they wanted, but he is also my son... and he's also an Australian citizen. Jeremy and I always planned to move to Australia for some of Luke's upbringing, because it's important to me for him to feel a sense of kinship with Australia as well as America. There's nothing in me that wants to white-wash my son, or ignore his African heritage, or have him lose a sense of identity- after all, I see my late husband in him in so many ways and it's such a comfort to me, he will always carry Jeremy and thus Jeremy's ancestry in him... but also... I'd like him to know my country and his family on my side, who are all white Australians but I do have strong Irish ancestry which was important to me growing up in a cultural sense, and could be important to Luke as well (simultaneously to his African heritage).  


I told Rita that I was planning this two days ago and she's barely talked to me since, besides yelling at me about essentially kidnapping him from his kin. I also overheard her say to my brother in-law that I'm trying to make 'Jeremy deader than he's already dead in a deserted wasteland of a country'. I don't think that she knows a great deal about Australia, but Melbourne is a big city- it's not a wasteland, it's home to me. I know that Jeremy would not agree with his mother on this, though I would never tell her that. Early on in our relationship, I was feeling a bit homesick and he surprised me with tickets to Australia for my birthday, and he loved Melbourne and the people/culture, which is why we always planned to live in Melbourne for a while, and Chicago for a while too.   


Am I wrong here? I know that I'm looking at this through the only lens that I have, and I fear I'm missing a bigger picture."
"I [28M] read my girlfriend's [27F] Instagram DMs this morning and found out she's been messaging a guy for months.


I'll give a quick rundown of where we are in life.

We started dating in December of 2016. She has a four year old son from a previous relationship. We have a four month old son together. We moved in together shortly before he was born in January. We've been fighting a lot lately because of the stress of having a new baby and her going back to work.

This morning I woke up and she was asleep on the couch with the baby. I snuck her phone into the bathroom and went through it. I found messages from some guy on Instagram. Super sexual stuff. Stuff like ""I want you to fuck me until I cry"" and saying she wishes she could be next to him. Sending him nudes. Telling him she loves him and can't wait to see him.

I confronted her about this and she said it was just for fun. That she's never done anything with him and wouldn't do anything with him. He lives two hours away. She only did this for the attention. She wanted to talk dirty with someone. I asked her why I can't be that person and she said because I see her every day and she thinks she's ugly and doesn't feel sexy. On the internet she can use pre-pregnancy nudes and get the attention she craves.

I feel betrayed. I feel like a fool. I feel alone and unloved and unrespected. I know that things have been hard since the baby was born, but I at least thought that we were committed and in this together.

I don't want our child to have separated parents, but at the same time how do I NOT leave her for this? How can I possibly know that she hasn't met up with this guy? I feel like if we stay together I'll question her every time she leaves the house and it will always be in the back of my mind.

TL;DR My girlfriend, who I just had a child with, has been sexting a guy for months and I don't know what to do."
"My roommate is eating my brand food and replacing it with off brand food


 

tl;dr **My roommate is eating my brand food and replacing it with off brand food**

I need help bringing up this conversation. It's getting to me now because I never said anything the first time. (The brand name foods, sometimes just taste better/perform better in dishes.)

I also do this thing where I consume foods in even numbers so I know how much I have left of something until it needs to be replaced. (I'm living paycheck to paycheck so this helps me budget and save money on lunches).

ex: I had bought a 1/4 lb of cheese and had enough to make certain amount of sandwiches, I found just a single slice of cheese left, when I should have had enough to be make at least 3 more sandwiches for the week.

I don't want to get a mini fridge for my room. The fridge is huge. And I don't want to label my food either. It just brings me back to growing up with 4 brothers and them just not giving a fuck because they were always hungry.

Things to know:

She has a good job and manageable expenses from what I can tell

She's also never home; works opp schedule from me

She's meal preps every week because of her special diet; she does keto or pelo

I have my own shelf but that doesn't stop her

I'm renting a room in her apt but have full access to everything"
"My [26] parents [50s] want me to take a loan for them


Hi r/relationships, 

I wasn't sure if I should post this on r/personalfinance or here, but here seemed like a better place. 

I'm 26, finished college and been working for about 2 years, with no debt at all, and only €1.5k saved up because I like to travel.

This is the second time my parents have asked me to take out a loan for them, and I managed to refuse them the first time with an excuse that the bank can't give me the money since I wasn't employed for 6 months at my new job. Which was stupid, since it gave them a chance to ask again. 

Few days ago they asked again, they have their own company and need 5k in order to apply for a project/grant which will give them a chance to develop a new product on the market and move to Spain in order to do it. They said the directors of the agency which approves the project are super interested, and they said the chance for the project to pass is 99%. This money will be a down payment to set up a company in Spain and all the logistics. They want me to take a 5 year loan for 5k.

But I know them, I know they borrowed money from all of our close family &amp; friends only to return just a little bit. The banks won't give them the money, so why should I? They say they will get the project which means they will have decent salaries and will be able to pay the monthly fee of €100. 

I immediately said no, but I tried to reason with them asking for more details on the project and exact financial figures, mentioned the word ""investor"" and all hell broke loose. They're mad at me now, saying I don't trust them, mentioning how they paid about €15k for my college &amp; life at that time, how you don't ask family financial figures, you just do it no questions asked. 

I tried to tell them how going into debt with still uncertainty that they will be able to pay 100€ each month for 5 years is a big deal. Besides, I don't want to have a loan for 5 years. I might want to get a house/apartment/car and won't be able to get another loan. I explained I need to know their current financial situation and a payment plan, but they were offended and said I can't act like an investor in their company, I'm a child. It was just horrible, considering they're the closest and only family I've got. 

Now I don't know what to do, should I consider taking out the loan or at least giving them all the money I've saved up? 

TLDR, my parents want me to take a €5k loan for 5 years, no discussion or questions asked, now they're mad at me. Should I do it? 

Thanks for reading!!"
"let down by MIL after break up


My partner (M35) of almost 7 years decided in April that our family was not worth fighting for. He married his mistress (F30-something) in August and is continuing on his happy path. 

The thing that hurts me the most is that his mom (F65) was more of a mother to me than my own mother. We had an awesome relationship. Since her son got married, she has pretty much written me off. She said after the break up that she will always be there for me, and that I should call her if I ever need to talk (she went through a very hurtful divorce with his dad). 
In the 2 times that I've called her she tried to get off the phone as quickly as possible. She doesn't call to speak to the kids anymore but did manage a text to ask if we are okay (our town had major flooding recently). Her son couldn't even manage a text to ask if his kids were okay. 

This is why I don't want to form connections with people. You never know when they might kick you to the curb.

TL; DR My ex MIL pretty much cut contact with me and kids since her son married his mistress"
"I (21M) just found out my new girlfriend's (28F) age


I have been seeing this girl for a couple of weeks and she's amazing.  We met at a nightclub and everything started from there

She's funny, intelligent, cute, attractive, the sex is great and she's quirky.  The main problem was that it took her a few weeks to tell me her age as she was self conscious about it.  I thought maybe she's like 25 at most (She looks 22, she's Asian so I guess that's pretty common?), but then it turns out she's turning 28 next month....

I personally don't know how I feel about this... I feel that she's mentally on my level (which sort of worries me - because I feel immature for my age). I'm currently a student and she's just started working (Did her undergrad in another country and did her masters in my country). 

I feel weird because I feel that maybe we are on a different level mentally and that I feel maybe I am going to get into a very old adult relationship when I'm still enjoying my uni life. 

Like she's probably gonna want to start a family soon and I'm definitely not doing that.

I don't know if it's all in my head and I'm over thinking this or it really is a big deal, what should I do??? 

Tldr: big age difference with new gf, dunno how to feel about it."
"My (F39) mother (F65) is making me incredibly uncomfortable and I am disgusted by her behavior.


I apologize in advance for grammar and spelling errors, I am very very tired. 

&amp;#x200B;

Let me preface this by saying that this is my first post on Reddit and after reading other posts, I was extremely impressed with this community. I am sorry for the ridiculously lengthy post but I hope you stay with me since this is something I could really use help with. I am hoping writing this down will be its own therapy. 

&amp;#x200B;

A little back story. I am an only child to two extremely career minded parents. I wasn't, in fact, supposed to exist as my parents were told they couldn't have children. Looking back, I was an extremely lonely child being bounced from one daycare to another. I was a typical latchkey kid until I was old enough to stay at home alone. My father was gone on business trips for months on end (government/military work) leaving my mother and I alone. I was always the last kid to be picked up at the end of the day and the first kid dropped off. I am not complaining, I know I had a good childhood and decent parents. I know I was given a lot of opportunities that a lot of kids my age didn't have. I think my parents felt like if they put me in enough activities that something would stick. Nothing did, much to their disappointment. They never really took an interest in anything I did, never really sat down and asked me what was going on, what I was interested in. They just hoped something would stick and their job would be done. It sounds callous but it's where my head's at right now.

&amp;#x200B;

In my family, it's not about how good or kind of a person you are that determines your success. It's where you went to school and how much money you make. I was always told college, career, marriage, kids. College, career, marriage, kids. College, career, marriage, kids. These things, in that order are what determine your success. My mother has two undergraduate degrees and a masters. My father has two undergrads and two masters. My mother grew up almost a rabid feminist. She never really wanted kids and if she did end up having kids, she certainly wouldn't have stayed home with them and sacrifice her life or her career. She followed through on that. The moment they found out she was pregnant with me, my father went and got snipped. It was most certainly a surprise and accident as both of my parents were in grad school when I came along. 

&amp;#x200B;

Disappointment is the name of the game here when it comes to my mother's feelings towards me. I was a solid ""C"" student in high school. Don't get me wrong, I had the brains but zero motivation. I was lazy. I never did drugs, I never stayed out late, I didn't even have sex FFS.  What I did have was a deep and ever-growing resentment towards my mother. With my Dad gone for months on end, the brunt of my teenage angst fell on my mother. Again looking back, this wasn't really fair to her but she didn't handle it all that well. I think she read every parent book she could find and tried every technique to make me respect her but I just couldn't. My mother got it in her head that I was one step away from juvie and told my father that they were going to a support group for ""troubled teens."" They got to the support group and as everyone took turns introducing themselves they briefly explained what their child was in to (drugs, etc) and what issues they were experiencing at home. My father could only take so much of other parents truly troubled teenage issues that he got up and left. He said they didn't belong in a support group like that. I wasn't troubled and that it was a waste of his time. This is an example of how dramatic my mother can be. 

&amp;#x200B;

My mother is the constant victim and unrepentant liar. She doesn't lie about the big things. Just tiny things. She half-asses almost everything in her life and when she gets called out on it (i.e. work or my dad getting upset with something) she lies about it. They're small lies but I grew up with them. I grew up seeing her lie to avoid repercussions of her laziness. There was no abuse in the household from what I am aware of,  she just didn't do the right thing most of the time. She didn't put in the hard work, which proceeded in to her not understanding why things didn't go her way, and then lying about the amount of work she put in to something. She did this with EVERYTHING. To be clear, I think she does this so people won't think ill of her for being lazy or forgetful or a shitty mom, etc. I think it's a confidence thing. Regardless, I grew up lying too. I would do a half-assed job on my homework or something and I would lie about it to my teachers and to my parents. I became a liar. Looking back, there was a fair amount of neglect on my parents part. 

&amp;#x200B;

Fast forward to me barely graduating from college with a degree I still don't use to this day, my parents had a mediocre student on their hands. I had no idea of what to do with my life.  I had met a man in college and I lost myself in him. I put him before everything to the detriment of my future, my education, and any hope of me knowing myself. He broke up with me the day after I graduated from college. There I was with a fresh new college degree I didn't know how to use, heart broken, and living at home with my parents. Oh and I was in a a shit ton of debt. Not from student loans because my education was free because of my parents but from ridiculous credit card purchases. To say I was a spoiled, entitled little middle class girl would be an understatement. I had had everything handed to me and I squandered it. I realize that and I own it. 

&amp;#x200B;

I found a job (through my mother) doing a kind of research. This is the kind of job that you fall in to when you are looking for your ""real"" career and never leave. To be fair though, I never left because I am amazing at it. I have a head for researching old documents and piecing together information. My employer saw my potential and rewarded me constantly. I was proud of how good I was at this job and knew what it felt like to not half-ass something for the first time. To take pride in my work was something I had never felt before. In the meantime, my mother kept expecting me to find my ""real"" job. 

&amp;#x200B;

I met my husband two years after I started this job, at work. We fell in love instantly and we moved in together two weeks after our first date much to my mother's horror. I still didn't really know who I was or what I wanted and I feared completely losing myself in a partner again so the first few years of our relationship were tumultuous. 

&amp;#x200B;

So here I was NOT using my degree, NOT continuing my education, living with a man out of wedlock, and getting fatter by the minute because it turns out I had severe depression and anxiety and ate my feelings. What's our word of the day again? Right, ""disappointment."" She never really came out and said anything, just made snide passive aggressive comments and how she would never do something like that. When my husband and I decided to get married, she never got involved in the wedding planning or the general happiness of the occasion. She tended to make it about her and how stressed she was or how put out she was at the moment. 

&amp;#x200B;

Fast forward almost 15 years of marriage, a move to another state,  and two beautiful boys. My husband and I have been through hell and back and we are stronger for it. I no longer lie. I own my faults and work hard to be a better person everyday. I am NOT a victim. Things don't happen to me for no reason. If something bad happens that I could have prevented, I own it, I learn from it and I move on. I now own my own thriving business in the work I originally fell in love with after college and I am damn good at it. One of the best in my field. We opened our business (which is closely tied to the real estate market) right before the bubble burst in 2008 and we struggled but our business survived and thrived. I still have a weight problem but I work out three times a week with a trainer and make healthy choices. I teach my boys that I am not a victim of my circumstance. I need to live with my choices and learn from them. Yet because I do not own my own home (we rent from my parents actually), I still have a weight problem, and I stay at home with my children instead of being in a career she determines is successful, I am a disappointment. 

&amp;#x200B;

I have come to terms with being a disappointment. My cousin (who is like a brother) is a millionaire with his own company. My mother often tells me that maybe I should talk to him to get a few ""pointers"" even though the two businesses are completely different. It's incredibly insulting because she doesn't know the first thing about me or my business and hasn't tried to understand. I know she feels that if we don't have a huge house, nice cars, etc is just isn't good enough. And that's fine. Really it is. I thought we would have a better relationship but I now know it will never happen and I am ok with that. 

&amp;#x200B;

Now to get to the crux of the issue (I know, it took a long time. For those of you actually reading this, I appreciate you and  the time you are giving me). I have ALWAYS been open about my mental health issues. Hindsight, being the wonderful luxury it is, tells me I was deeply depressed in middle/high/college. It took my beloved husband to tell me to go see a damn doctor or we would have to get a divorce to understand that I needed help. So I got it and I never looked back. I don't see taking medication as a weakness. I view depression and anxiety as an issue that needs to be maintained. I have helped several people find their way to getting mental help including ex soldiers with PTSD. I openly and willingly tell people who are struggling that they are loved and needed on this earth and to call me anytime for help. I have become a very open and honest person who views passive aggression as a poison. I value my relationships and take time to mend them, tend to them, and make sure people feel loved. My mother is MORTIFIED by this behavior. You could chalk this up to a generation thing where you just dealt with these things and admitting that you are getting help is a weakness to be exploited. She would say to me ""once you go on those medications, you can never get off of them.""

&amp;#x200B;

So finally, two weeks ago, I think my mother had a mental breakdown. It may have been longer than that but two weeks is when it came to my attention. She comes to my house every few weeks to spend time with the boys. When she showed up on my porch this day, she barely said a word. Her eyes were sunken and she looked like hell. She didn't even say hello to my youngest son. When we got him off to school, I asked her what was wrong. She said she wasn't getting any sleep and she felt like she had no where to turn. Her brother was recently diagnosed with terminal cancer and she said she was stressed and upset about that which is weird to me because she has always disliked her brother. I understand that coming to terms with death via one of your siblings is rough but this feels like she is taking other people's pain and making it her own to have people feel sorry for her. 

&amp;#x200B;

I couldn't get a straight answer out of her. I keep asked her what was wrong. At this point we were on my front porch. She would get up walk down the stairs and halfway to her car and then turn around to walk back up and sit on the stairs again repeatedly saying she was so tired and she needed to go home (she lives a few hours away from us). She did this maybe ten times. I told her repeatedly that I was not comfortable with her driving and putting herself and others at risk. Finally I told her very strongly to go in and lay down on my bed. She slept for maybe two hours and got up again. Before she got up, I called my father to find out what the fuck was going on and he said she wasn't sleeping and that she had been taking two ambien a night. Knowing what I know about what ambien can do to your brain, when she got up I told her she needed to stop taking those. They may be making things worse. She then asked me if I had called my father and I said I had. She flipped out and said ""he's going to be so mad at me. Please don't do that again, he's going to be so mad at me."" She acted like he was going to beat her which I know for a FACT that that wouldn't have happened. At this point I had asked my husband to come home because my mother's strange behavior was freaking me out. He noticed it right away and suggested we go to the dr. She refused saying they wouldn't be able to help her. She then leaves to go to the bathroom while my husband and I talk. When she comes back out, her pants are down around her ankles. My husband immediately starts staring and something interesting on the ceiling while my mouth drops open. Not noticing our behavior, she slowly pulls her pants up like she was still in the bathroom. She then proceeds to start walking back and forth to the car again, this time over 20 times. At this point, I had had enough. She is obviously going through something and I have offered her so many options to get her help and I am seriously considering checking her in to a hospital for mental help. She starts to walk to the door to walk out to the car to leave when she looks at me expecting to say something and I snap and say ""Fine. I have given you plenty of options. You could stay here over night. You could go to the Dr. We could get dad to come pick you up. Driving home would be wrong and irresponsible. But do it. You aren't listening. You are choosing misery. I don't know what's going on but I can't stop you."" It was almost as if she was trying to manipulate me in to feeling bad for her because the moment I stopped she said ""ok well I guess I need to go to the dr."" She stopped putting on that bullshit act. At this point, my workday is completely gone and my ability to make money for the day has gone down the drain. It's fine, I can handle that but my stomach turned at the thought that this was some kind of manipulation to get attention or sympathy.  I cannot take her to the dr because I need to get some work done and my husband has taken the rest of the day off for obvious reasons so he takes her. She does not like this. She repeatedly asks me why I can't take her. I want to believe at this point that she couldn't help her behavior but it felt like manipulation to me. The Dr ends up telling her she needs fucking help (no surprise) and to stop taking the damn ambien. He gives her a sleeping drug and tells her to spend the night at my house.

&amp;#x200B;

She comes home and it's evening at this point so she gets ready for bed. She walks out AGAIN WITH NO PANTS ON this time in front of my children. I tell her she needs pants and she says to me ""but this is the way I sleep"" and then proceeds to the couch to watch a movie with us. Ten minutes later she looks at me and says ""I guess I need pants."" WTF? She goes to bed and gets up at 4:30 am to go home but not without leaving and then coming back, ringing the door bell, waking the house up to tell us she loves us over and over and over again before she leaves for good. When she gets home she texts ""Friday stays between you and me. Your father is a good person. Don't tell anyone about Friday."" Over the past few weeks she has been extremely clingy and loving which really really bothers me. She keeps calling and asking if any of her friends are calling me. Telling me they were acting weird and asking if they talked to me. I don't talk to ANY of her friends more than once a year. 

&amp;#x200B;

Guys, I am not going to hold back here. I am physically (literally) repulsed by this behavior. I know she might be having a mental breakdown and I know that if she is, she deserves sympathy and I am having a hard time giving it. I feel disgusted with the way she has treated my mental health issues in past and that her refusal to get help up until now has lead us to this point. She still acts like the victim. Verbally she has always acted very loving. She expects hugs and ""I love you's"" all the time from me and I am hard pressed to give them. It's become quite a joke in my friend circle (my true family) that I am not a hugger. I feel like a hug from her is manipulation.  I don't feel like hugs or physical contact should be given lightly. She sees that a sign of love. I cannot stand to touch her. Even before any of this happened.

&amp;#x200B;

How do I move forward? Should I feel like a complete POS because I don't have empathy for her? She always looks so wounded when I don't give her the sympathy and affection she wants but I find it almost physically impossible. I love my father. He has shown every kindness. He shows love and patience and acceptance. I have no feelings like this towards my mother. So my questions are:

1) Am I a total POS because I find her behavior repulsive even though she might not be able to help it? 

2) Is it ok to say I may not love my mother? 

3) Could this be a sign of dementia? Or could this be her seeing that she completely fucked out relationship and now she regrets it? 

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR; My (F39) mother (65) may have had a mental breakdown and I have a very negative reaction to it. I am not sure how to move forward."
"Girlfriend (22F) upset about something I (28M) cannot control


We have been together for 1.5 years. Since the beginning she has known about my health issues. I have always been completely open and honest about it. 
I had severe anxiety in the past and have a sleeping disorder. It’s going better now, but I still have a lot of things to work on. For starters, I experience (sometimes extreme) fatigue every day. What this means is that I am limited in what I can do. I do push myself a lot, but it takes it’s toll on me if I’m not careful. 


My girlfriend has lived abroad for the passed five months and I have visited her five times, next week will be the sixth. 
She has said she has difficulties with my health and not being able to do everything she would want to do with me. I understand that and also would want to do much more. 
I am working a lot on it, visiting different physicians and doing therapy. 
Today my girlfriend told me she wants me to be energetically happy when I’m with her, because it makes her feel better (she says she needs someone like that around her). I always have a good, though calm, mood, but it’s rare for me to be energetic. Even if I wanted to, I can’t. She thinks I can do much more. 


I feel under appreciated. I don’t want to victimize myself, because I certainly am not one, but I push myself a lot to be able to do as much as possible with her. I travel each month to visit her, never let her pay anything, I cook most of the times, try to do nice small things, I have all the patience in the world to talk to her about her insecurities and other things. But it’s not enough. On one hand she says she can’t lose me, but the other she says she can’t handle what I have. This results in almost daily stress. 
When I tell her that, if it’s the case she cannot deal with how I am at this moment and my life, we are not compatible, she gets upset. She says she is asking a very ‘normal’ thing of me, anybody would want that. It ends up being a constant reminder that I am not well enough. 


I know she means well and she is visibly troubled by all of this, but I can’t give more than I am giving and it is stressing me out a lot. 



tl;dr: my (28m) gf (22f) of 1.5 years wants me to do be energized happy when I am with her, even though I have chronic fatigue and am already pushing myself as much as I can"
"Is it wrong for me (29M) to ask my GF (28F) to confirm she's on birth control


I've been dating my girlfriend for six months. After a few weeks of meeting, we decided to become sexually active. At the time she said she had an IUD so I was like 'great' and didn't think anything of it.

&amp;#x200B;

Fast Forward to recently and she said casually in passing that her IUD expired. The next day I mentioned that it bothered me that her IUD is expired as we've been having unprotected sex and that I'm 1) not yet ready to be a father and 2) still not 100% sure I want to marry her at this time.

&amp;#x200B;

I voiced my concerns that I was uncomfortable with her comments about the IUD expiring and she played it off like it wasn't a big deal and said she was joking. She has joked a few times about getting pregnant, but never going to the extent of suggesting she doesn't have active birth control. I asked for confirmation that she does indeed have a working IUD, and she became extremely defensive (which was expected to some extent since it was a sensitive topic and I can see how it can be viewed as a trust issue on top of my concerns). She proceeded to become very defensive and told me that her previous long term ex BF never questioned this, that she could date any guy in our lovely southwestern hometown, and that I'd be extremely lucky to have a child with her vs actually addressing my concerns.

&amp;#x200B;

When i shared my concerns, I tried to do so in a very non accusatory manner and from the perspective that I had a concern vs her doing or not doing something. No one shouted and for the most part it was very civil, but she was extremely defensive. After the initial discussion, we talked about it 24 hours later but it was essentially the same outcome. After separate \~30 minute discussions she has yet to understand why I'm concerned and seems to have no plans to provide confirmation. This has led me to say that I'll be using condoms from now on, and she is not happy about this.

&amp;#x200B;

While I do understand that my basic ask of ""prove to me you have active birth control"" can be interpreted many ways, I really don't think it's an irrational ask when we're having unprotected sex and she's been inconsistent in saying if she does. Overall things are good in our relationship. She's hasn't given me reason to not trust her, so I really don't think that this isn't a manifestation or projection of something else that bothers me.

&amp;#x200B;

Anyways, am I in the wrong or being irrational? This isn't about never wanting kids or not liking her, it's really just that right now in life, I am not ready to be a father and while I understand mistakes happen, I want to be as diligent as possible.

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR: GF told me she's on IUD birth control, then she told me she's not, then she told me she was.  When I asked for confirmation because she has told me different things, she has been very defensive and does not seem to want to provide confirmation"
"My (34f) husband (36m) is frequently rude to me, just for a moment, but it ruins the night for me.


My husband has problems with anger. Not just with me -- with everyone. Especially people he feels comfortable around.

&amp;#x200B;

I've noticed the same pattern keeps happening over and over. Things will be going great, we are happy and getting along and we decide to go out for dinner. He asks me what the address is for the restaurant so he can punch it into GPS. I read it to him, but make an error on one of the numbers. He tells me it is wrong. Our conversation goes like this:

&amp;#x200B;

Him:  That's not it.

Me:  Oops! Sorry, I was one number off.  It is....

Him: Forget it, I'll look it up myself. How fucking hard is it to read the number out correctly? For fuck sakes.

&amp;#x200B;

I don't say anything, but my mood is immediately deflated. He goes back to normal right away like nothing even happened. I feel hurt. If I speak to him about it, he will apologize. But chances are good it will happen again either later that day or in a couple of days. It happens all the time.

&amp;#x200B;

Another time we were with friends (the wife was driving) and she asked me a question about directions. I hesitated for a moment and then gave her an answer (that was a little hesitant because I was unsure and still thinking it through). My husband chastised me in front of them:

&amp;#x200B;

Him:  Andlaieriaka, you really need to learn how to communicate better and more clearly.  Saying *""I don't know for sure, I think maybe going this way will be better, but....hmmmm...I'm not sure""* is not helpful at all. If you don't know, just say so.

Me:  feeling stupid and humiliated in front of our friends, so I say nothing.

&amp;#x200B;

I know these sound like minor things, but they happen ALL THE TIME. I tell him to stop talking to me like I'm a child or an idiot. He speaks to me like I'm a kid. But the worst is that he speaks to me this way in front of other people. He has snapped at me, been short with me, ordered me around and spoken to me in very condescending ways around everyone. It's embarrassing and it makes me want to cry. He will apologize if I tell him it hurts me, but he never stops.  One of the worst things for me is that he is charming, the life of the party and very funny and extroverted. Everyone LOVES him. They fall all over him. I'm just this quiet little introverted mouse. People watch him speak to me this way and say nothing. And go on loving him and thinking he's the best thing since sliced bread.

&amp;#x200B;

I just feel very alone. I'm not sure how to get him to understand this is not cool.

&amp;#x200B;

tldr: husband talks down to me all the time, including in front of other people."
"My boyfriend 23m took a 3 hr nap w his 23f best friend in his bed. Is this ok?


21F here. My boyfriend and I have been together almost two years. He (23M) has a best friend who is a girl (23f). She just got into (our) town early this morning to visit her family/friends. She went to his house at 5 am this morning to see her best friend (my boyfriend). They talked for a while, took a nap for three hours in his bed, woke up, then they continued talking and she left. He just told me all this a while ago through fb messenger, to which I replied, “where did she sleep?” He replied but I haven’t replied since, as I want to think this through. It feels like I’ve been cheated on. Sleeping with someone is an intimate act. Especially with someone of the opposite sex. Wouldn’t a guy be upset if his girlfriend slept with another guy? Even if there’s no sex or touching involved. To make matters worse, I’m already a sensitive person when it comes to stuff like this and he knows that about me. Do I have the right to feel upset? Betrayed? I feel sick to my stomach thinking about him in bed with another girl. In the bed we make love in. The bed we sleep together in. I feel betrayed. I feel cheapened. Like our time in that bed has lessened in value and intimacy. I don’t know if I can get past this.

tl;dr my (23f) boyfriend (23m) slept with his best friend (23f) for three hours in his bed, no sex or touching. Should I be upset?"
"Would it be wrong of me [M24] to ask my gf [F22] to delete the guy she had sex with from her social media?


I’m in a three and a half year old relationship with my GF, however last September we broke up for a couple of months during which she started a very intense sexual relationship with someone else. They eventually stopped seeing each other and she got back together with me on February, but she still has this dude on all of her social media. She knows that it hurts me that they had sex during the time we weren’t together, so we don’t talk about it and are trying to move on, but he likes every picture and post she uploads to her social media accounts, which makes it very difficult to not think about what happened.

Would I be the wrong if I asked her to delete him? It somehow doesn’t feel right to ask her, but it also doesn’t feel right that she still has contact with him.

Tl;dr: Broke up with girlfriend, she started a sexual relationship with someone else, it ended, got back together with me, but still has this guy in social media."
"I'm(28f) sitting in a hotel with my siblings(30,42m) while our mom is in intensive care down the street.


She started chemo 10 days ago. But on Saturday night she went to emergency. She was diagnosed with necrotizing fasciitis. Due to her lowered immune system. We are not sure how any of this happened. And none of us know what to say. I don't know why I'm writing this. She is in critical condition. She has had her leg amputated at the hip as the best chance for her to survive. I'm terrified of her reaction when she wakes up. I got to see her and hold her hand and tell her I love her.  She is truly my best friend. She is my go to girl and I have No idea what I would do without her. 

Tldr. We are 3 lost kids about to possibly lose our mom."
"My (F/25) boyfriend (M/25) travelled six hours to spend a weekend with his friend (F/25) in my hometown.


For context:
- We are in a long distance relationship (6 hours drive). 
- We’ve been together just over two years. He also had a brief fling with the aforementioned friend. 
- His friend has made it clear that she doesn’t like me/doesn’t think I’m good enough for him. 

So, I hadn’t seen my boyfriend (M/25) in two months (due to both of our work commitments and generally very busy schedules) and then I found out (through a Facebook post) that he had travelled down to my hometown last weekend and had spent the weekend with his friend (F/25). They had gone for food and drinks and then had had a night out, and he stayed over hers two nights. 

What upset me was that he hadn’t considered to tell me that he was going to do this, and obviously wasn’t interested in seeing me or bothered that we hadn’t seen each other in so long. He didn’t text me at all over the whole weekend either. 

What has also upset me is that he hasn’t ever actually been the one to travel to see me. I have always travelled to see him (we have both moved about a lot and the distances have varied, I have only recently moved back to my hometown). 

I can’t believe that he would travel such a long distance to see a friend and not think to ask if I wanted to see him at all. I know that he’s absolutely entitled to see his friends and not me, but I feel like he’s willing to go the extra mile for her and not me. This isn’t the first time that there have been problems with this friend. 

I have tried speaking to him about it but he got immediately defensive about it and said I was overreacting and upset over nothing. His ex girlfriend was also very uneasy about his friendship with this girl, and he keeps saying how much I’m reminding him of his ex. 

I was cheated on in the past, and didn’t find out until 8 months later, even though all the signs were there, so I’m just worried that I’m making a fool out of myself again. 

Am I upset over nothing? Or is it strange that someone would travel to their girlfriend’s hometown to see someone else and not even suggest seeing their girlfriend too? Is there a better way of making him see why I’m upset?

TDLR: I don’t know if I’m overreacting over my boyfriend (M/25) travelling six hours to spend a weekend with his friend (F/25) in my (F/25) homework when I haven’t seen him in two months."
