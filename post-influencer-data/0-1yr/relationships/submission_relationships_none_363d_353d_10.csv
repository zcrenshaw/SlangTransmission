"UPDATE: My best friend has fallen deep in love with what is most certainly a catfish but he won't listen to me. How to make him snap out of it?


[Link to Original Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/9f1yvi/my_best_friend_has_fallen_deep_in_love_with_what/)

&amp;#x200B;

Hi guys, just wanted to give all of you an update and a thank you. So my best  who's always had a good head on his shoulders was falling deep in love for the past 4 months with what I strongly believed was a catfish (stunning girl who claims to be a 34 year old medical doctor AND nurse practitioner, who won't video chat, who's cell phone camera broke, makes excuses to not meet) - and I didn't know how to wake him up without hurting him.  I tried everything, talking to him, etc, but he wouldn't listen. So made the plea to you guys and I just wanted to say :

&amp;#x200B;

THANK YOU SO MUCH to all of you!

&amp;#x200B;

I chose the best quotes from the lot of you, especially all the quotes from NPs, MDs, recommending me to look up her NPI number that all medical providers must have -- and especially a shoutout to  [**u/rs5448**](https://www.reddit.com/user/rs5448/) who hires doctors for a living. I sent those quotes to him, and it kind of gave him a shock. He went searching through all the NPI databases for her and couldn't find her (even though he was able to find all his other medical provider friends).

&amp;#x200B;

Like many of you said would happen he was still in denial. But he was open for me to do some more digging. I ended up calling the hospitals in California where she said her parents were staying, and of course no one by those names were staying there. He paid for a phone tracking service, and found out that the phone number was actually in Chicago, not in California. And it belonged to a 74 year old army veteran who had passed away recently - turns out the girl was most likely the daughter replaying out her father's death and using it to gain sympathy as part of her catfish story.

&amp;#x200B;

My friend asked for her NPI number, and she just went silent, knowing she was caught. And that's been the end of it. She stopped texting him, calling him, etc. He wants to thank all of you for helping out. You saved many more months, possibly years of his life draining away to this catfish creature, and we want to really thank all of you so much. Reddit's communities are amazing, I'll try to pay it forward when I can. Thanks guys!

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR: Reddit saved my friend from being catfished, and I just wanted to say thanks!!

"[Update] Saw my roommate's [30m] ex [29f] leaving my other roommate's [31m] bedroom. Say something? Mind my business?


https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/9ezb01/saw_my_roommates_30m_ex_29f_leaving_my_other

Last post didn't get much attention but the update is kinda of funny so enjoy:

Last post was pretty much this:

John and Kate dated pretty casually for a couple years. Greg is John's and my roommate. I saw Kate leaving Greg's room one night after seeing them outside talking once while John was gone. Greg will leave on mysterious ""walks"" which is out of character and not suited to our neighborhood. Wondered if I should say anything to John or mention it to Greg and/or Kate, and decided against it for the time being.

Saturday night I had a weekend trip cut short. I came home to Kate and Greg's cars in the driveway and John's was gone. I held my breath a bit and even circled the block worried I was gonna walk into a scene I didn't want to know about. When I walked in, no one was home, which was weird but better than I expected. I settled in and hopped in the shower and put on a movie in the living room because I was extremely curious at this point about what was going on.

Too bad though, I passed out before anyone got back but woke up to ""shh shhh he's sleeping"" and drunken giggles. It was more than two people but the way the house is set up it was impossible for me to see who all showed up. It was definitely at least Greg and Kate though.

 I wait a bit and then go to my room and see Greg's bedroom door is open but empty. John's door is closed and there is light and TV noise coming from it. I peek outside and his car is there. I gave up on trying to figure it out for the night and went to bed.

The next morning I'm up early with my door open. I see Kate leave Greg's room and say hi. She acts totally normal, asking if I'm feeling better (I sent them a courtesy text that I was home), asking about weekend plans and work stuff. She goes to the bathroom and Greg leaves his room. He comes by my door and I must have had a look on my face because he just smiled and shrugged. Obviously whatever is going on is somewhat out in the open so whatever. They go downstairs to the kitchen and out comes John from his room, followed by a woman I met a few times who is friends with Kate. I ask if they had fun last night and he says he's sorry if I heard anything weird. I say I didn't, since I didn't, and they proceed down the stairs, too. Idk what I was thinking but I still braced myself for drama though it didn't seem like anyone was hiding anything.

The ladies leave and I ask Greg and John point blank what is going on. They get kind of sheepish but it comes out that Greg's been hooking up with Kate since June and Kate set John up with her friend and they ended up all in bed together last night. I bust out laughing because it was unexpected but not wholly shocking. Later that night Greg goes on one of his walks and I asked him what the deal is with that. Well apparently he buys weed from Kate that she picks up at the dispensary because he's paranoid about having his ID on file because he works a government job. I asked why she doesn't just come in like a normal person and he claims they just like to enjoy a bit of private time to make out and talk without anyone else around, which is fair because the house is rarely empty. 

So. Nothing scandalous. Just some consensual Non-monogamy and some legally gray area weed exchange. Better than expected. 


**tl;dr** they're all just fucking each other and selling weed. Crisis and drama averted."
"[Update] Me [21 M] with my girlfriend [19 F] dating for 2 years, how can i tell her, i want to cancel our marriage?


Link to old post : https://ud.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/9hd4se/me_21_m_with_my_girlfriend_19_f_dating_for_2/  
  
After some serious thinking and mental breakdowns, i came to the conclusion ""i cant marry her"". So last Saturday i told my girlfriend im not ready yet. She was really angry and sad, it was obvious understandable.  
I also felt guilty but after the conversation i felt free. It was probably the hardest conversation in my life but i feel so much better right now.  
  
Even tho things are still difficult between us, her parents hate me and we are overthinking our relationship and thinking about a breakup everything is just better.  
     
Someone said ""If you relationship cant handle a wedding postpone, your relationship wont handle a marriage"" and i think hes absolutly right. If she leaves me now, im 100% sure it was the right choice. Also someone gave me the question :   
  
""If it came down to a choice between getting married and breaking up -- do you have a clear preference for one or the other?""
  
And yes, my preference was clearly breaking up. I never thought about that way.  
  
I even realized our relationship has a lot of problems and im thinking of breaking up aswell. Maybe starting to focus more on myself,but i will decide that in a week or so, depends on how things will go between us from now on.  
Also i realized that im lacking friends and social contact. i have some friends but in the past 2 years i did nothing else than doing stuff with my girlfriend. Basically we were together 24/7 except work. I neglected my friends and yesterday i met some friends and it felt great. I honestly start doing more with my friends and trying to find new friends *SOMEHOW*  
  
Thanks for reading.

TL;DR : I was unsure about my wedding, but in the end i cancelled it and it was the hardest choice and the hardest conversation in my life. Everything was paid but in the end it was worth it. The relationship might be falling apart now, but i rather breaking up than paying a divorce in a year or so."
"Update : My boss is the source of my anxiety, I want to quit , 7 months later


Original post : https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/7vhay1/my_45_f_boss_60sf_is_the_source_of_my_anxiety_due/?utm_source=reddit-android

It's been 7 months and I'm happy to say I have officially quit, my last day is next week. I dwindled my days down to 2 and have recently started training at my new job the remainder of the week.


I developed alopecia and started losing my hair from the stress. I was not going to allow this woman to take my hair along with my sense of self worth.


The news went better than expected when I explained I was leaving. Of course I didn't tell her my true reasoning, I cited somewhat truths to keep her happy and my side gig secured with her. 
She offered a huge raise and other benefits, but nothing could keep me there, minus her pressence.  She said I was irreplaceble. Too late for praise now, maybe you should have treated me with respect. I didn't say this, though I wanted to, oh how I wanted to. 

2 decades of stress, anxiety , and being talked down to by my boss is officially coming to an end and I have the very kind redditors who messaged me and responded with words of encouragement to thank. Some of you offered to help me write a resume and some even offered me a job. If I could hug you guys I would, I'm truly that grateful. 

My poor replacement is already feeling her wrath. I have warned her and told her to not allow herself to be a doormat. She's young, so I'm worried she's a bit naive, as was I and will accept the abuse. 😔

I was offered a job as soon as I mentioned wanting to quit to a friend. I have benefits and work in a laid back atmosphere where I'm adjusting to not working under a narcissistic , bullying dictator. I'm learning I don't have to apologize constantly over the smallest mistakes to my new boss to keep them calm and happy. It's absolutely refreshing. 


Thank you.

**TL;DR**

**I lost a good chunk of my hair. 
I quit. 
She took it moderately ok. 
I have a new job. 
Best of luck to my replacement, you're going to need it girl. 
I have Reddit to thank for the kind words and the push I needed to save my sanity and health.**"
"My Husband (22M) Settled For Me (F21)


**TL;DR: Snooped through my husbands phone and found messages about his feelings towards me before we got married. Now I feel like I shouldn’t have gotten married.**


Hi Reddit,

Sorry for the repost I’m an absolute noob and don’t really know how this works. 

I’m feeling so extremely sad right now, and I just don’t know what to do. I’m sorry if this post is messy or jumbled... I am not in a clear headspace at the moment. 

My husband and I just got married at the beginning of July. We started dating five years ago in high school and were basically each other’s first everything. However, we have had our fair share of ups and downs. We have dated other people but always found our way back to each other. We’ve done long distance for about 4 years on and off. 

We got a house on base about a month ago and began living with each other. I uprooted my life to be here with him, though I didn’t have much going for myself in my hometown. 

I thought that we were getting along okay- he drives my car 45 minutes to work every morning  at 5 am and has it all day- sometimes until 5 pm. I’ve just been kind of existing here in our house... I don’t get out much. I’m really shy when it comes to meeting new people and he has our car M-F so I would have no way of really leaving the house anyway.... you can’t really walk off of a military base like the one I’m at, so I’m basically stuck. I try to keep the house affairs in order and be a good housewife and cook him nice meals every night because I’ve been worried that he’ll resent me for not working while he busts his ass all day long. 

I guess my worst fear came true when about thirty minutes ago I went through his Snapchat. I’ve noticed since we’ve been living together that he’s very protective of his phone and always tilts the screen away from me if I’m in the same room. It’s made me really uneasy but I haven’t brought it up because I figured I’d eventually find out for myself. We went to dinner tonight and I asked his passcode so I could change the song. At first he said he didn’t remember it (because it’s a shape and six digits long) but I did get it open. I filed it into the back of my mind until we got home and he passed out on the couch. Then I began to do some digging. 

I know that I’m in the wrong here and that people are entitled to their own privacy, but I’m snoopy and I want a transparent marriage. I don’t want to feel like things are being hidden from me, but I know if someone is doing something shady and you question them about it, they’re going to delete any possible proof. So I did it secretly. Did it make me feel bad and slimy? Yes. But I what I found made me feel worse. 

I found a text conversation with one of our semi mutual friends (21F). It was a little flirty, but no major red flags. She’s a very nice person and supportive of our relationship. The thing I saw that utterly destroyed me is when I saw his conversation with her from before he proposed to me. He was talking about how there are things he wants to experience still that he can’t do with me, how he was getting cold feet about a commitment commitment, how I drive him crazy because we have different values when it comes to personal finances and morals, how he had already trapped himself mentally so he should just go through with it so we could have a house and have time together before his deployment, how they should get drinks if it doesn’t work out, and the worst of it all... how he’s never told anyone but

 “idk I feel like I’m settling”. Reading that sentence really made my heart feel like it cracked into two pieces. If I had known that he felt that way or even said that....... I don’t think we would have gotten married. 


So now I’m just sitting upstairs silently crying because I don’t know if I should even confront him about this or not. I really don’t know what to do. I feel absolutely awful and I’ve felt bad about myself for a long time... this is just the straw that broke the camels back.

I didn’t find anything else very interesting aside from messages to an old one night stand which prove that he lied to me about not having been with anyone when we weren’t together and how he’s had an orgy, etc. I can’t really be mad about those things because we were separated, but I feel absolutely sick. I love my husband and I thought we were trying to build a happy life together. But how can I ever be happy knowing this?

Please give me any advice. "
"My husband (26m) never wears his wedding ring anymore and it makes me (25f) sad.


My husband and I got married a bit more than a year ago after dating for 10 years. He's truly the love of my life and I'm so thankful that I was able to find the one so soon. On top of that, we're also best friends and everything about our relationship is just so perfect and understanding. We complement each other so well. 

However, since about four to five months after our wedding, he started wearing his band less and less. At first it was just on the weekends when he would forget to put it on (he always takes it off to sleep) and then it got to the point where he stopped wearing it to work all together. I've talked to him about this and asked him why and he told me that it was ""uncomfortable"" for him and he always fidgets with it. He's also apparently afraid to lose it because he constantly fidgets with it and it's ""a bit loose"" on him. I do notice that he sometimes likes to play with the ring like twist it and slide it on and off. 

He never wears the ring to work either. The only times he'll put it on is if we're going out to an event or visiting family. It's looking to me like he feels like it's an obligation to wear the ring and not something he enjoys or wants to do, if that makes any sense. The only redeeming factor in all of this is that he still wears this necklace made out of amethyst that I made him when I went through a jewlery-making phase when I was 18. He wears it every single day and doesn't even take it off to shower. That makes me all melty and happy and I guess sometimes, it overshadows him never wearing his ring. 

My husband works for as a software engineer and I know most, if not all of his co-workers know that we're married so I doubt he's trying to hide the fact that we're married to anyone at work. I am also very sure this is not a fidelity issue. He is one of the most trustworthy and honest people I know and I've basically grown up with him and know him better than anyone. 

Everything else is wonderful. We're renting a great place in a great city (but we're looking to buy soon), I'm starting my final year of med school, and he's just received a promotion a couple weeks ago. It's just this one issue that makes me upset and sad. 

I'm not really sure how to approach this topic anymore. I've talked to him about this multiple times and it's always just been ""it's uncomfortable"", ""it doesn't fit well"", ""I'm afraid to lose it/I always fidget with it"". Could there be an underlying cause that I'm completely missing? I would really appreciate an outsider's look in on this. Thanks. 

Forgot to add that I wear my wedding band and engagement ring every single day and I'm always happy and proud to see it on my finger. 

Tl;DR: Husband of one year stopped wearing his wedding band four to five months after our wedding. I've talked to him about this multiple times and it's always just been ""it's uncomfortable"", ""it doesn't fit well"", ""I'm afraid to lose it/I always fidget with it"".

"Update: Me [35 F] with my husband [39 M] (18 years), my father is offering to give me a downpayment for a house with conditions that are offensive to my husband.


Previous post: https://old.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/9ezo04/me_35_f_with_my_husband_39_mf_18_years_my_father/

We decided to put the issue of accepting a down payment on hold because we may be moving in a year or two!

While my husband was initially very against moving to a more affordable location away from his paradise, he has given it serious consideration, and is now on board with certain conditions. Namely, I deal with my depression issues prior to moving.

He spoke to someone he respects who did something similar for his wife (life long surfer whose entire career revolved around surfing moved away from the ocean because of his wife). I wasn't in on the conversation, but the jist of it was he told my husband he got over a decade of playtime and living his dream life while I supported him and now it's time for my husband to do something to support me (emotionally).

It may be awhile before we can move and it's still not 100%, but I feel much better knowing that my husband does care and is willing put aside his desires for me.

Overall, this made me love my husband even more and I am very lucky to have him.

**Tl;dr: turns put communicating priorities and needs to a partner actually works!**"
"[UPDATE] Boyfriend (32M) is not interested in facing his problems. I’m (31F) afraid I’ll be supporting him financially forever.


[Link](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/8xbjss/boyfriend_32m_is_not_interested_in_facing_his/) to the previous post.

Briefly, my boyfriend was basically sitting around all day doing nothing for a year and I was tired to see that situation. Back in July, when I made the previous post, he was a month from his PhD defense and had not begun to write his thesis yet. I decided to help him and together we planned everything he needed to do until the due date, August 20. I told him if he wanted to finish everything in time, he would need to give up some addictions like RPG gaming and Netflix. He agreeded.

&amp;#x200B;

He finished his paper and began the thesis, spent some nights awake working, but never asked for my help. During those nights, sometimes I woke up to pee to see that he was actually gaming, but somehow, I didn't care anymore. All I wanted was having all this ended. Well, he managed to write the thesis on time, albeit shitty-written and full of grammar/formatting errors. His advisor was surprised he finished it on time - so was everyone, I guess. Defense went smoothly and he was approved. I felt nothing but relieve.

&amp;#x200B;

That same day, we went home and he asked me why I was so cold towards him lately. I told him we could talk other day, and opened a bottle of wine to celebrate. He didn't let it go. After a glass of wine, he started to push me to talk to him, and asked me if I wanted to end the relationship. I took a deep breath and told him yes. He asked if I was serious and I confirmed. Then everything became a shitstorm. He went full drama mode, crying and screaming that 'he will never be happy in his life'. Punched the wall. Started to cry on the backyard,  the neighbors listening to everything. He went to take a shower and punched the wall again, this time screaming too, and scared the shit out of me. I was crying and devastated watching all this, and started to feel guilty because I wanted to end things - he called me selfish and coward.

&amp;#x200B;

Summarizing, he ultimately calmed down, we talked some days later and I told him everything that made me come to that decision. It took him 18 days to move out, and those were the hardest days I had in my entire life. All the psychological pressure he made me, all the crying and moaning, he didn't eat and used this as emotional blackmail... that sad atmosphere suffocating me and draining my energy was very hard to take. I helped him move out, felt bad on the first couple hours, but now - I feel happy, peaceful, free, and thankful for sticking to my decision until the end.

&amp;#x200B;

Thank you for all the support.

&amp;#x200B;

\*\*tl;dr:\*\* he successfully defended his thesis, I broke up with him the same day and he moved out some days later. It was a hard and painful breakup proccess but now I feel happy and peaceful."
"My [24,f] boyfriend [30, m] of two years revealed to me something he did before I met him.. and now I'm questioning my relationship with him


Two months before I met my boyfriend, he threw a bachelor party for his best friend who was getting married. My boyfriend revealed to me recently that he paid for an escort and pushed his friend to sleep with her. My boyfriend and his friends found it funny and told the escort not to leave his friends side and to try and get him to sleep with her at all costs...the groom eventually gave in and slept with the escort 

I find the fact that he pushed his friend to cheat so disgusting. I guess that fact that my father was a cheating bastard makes all this even more sickening. I told this to my boyfriend and his response was that bachelor parties are bound to happen and that it's customary for the groom to enjoy some 'entertainment' before he gets married.

Me and my boyfirend had a lengthy talk beforehand about infidelity and we both agreed that sex with someome else is cheating, so I'm not sure if my boyfriend finds making someone else cheat normal but wouldn't do it himself or what..did he change over those two years that I spent with him ?

I just find the whole thing sick and I wish I didn't come to know this. 

Tl;dr: I'm questioning my relationship with my boyfriend after knowing that he pushed his friend to cheat.."
"My 65 year old dad pretends to faint from anxiety for sympathy and my family believes him. I'm (33) sick of it.


 I (33) have two younger siblings: brother (24) and sister (18). My mom and dad got divorced about 2 years ago.  I have a family and my brother and sister stayed with my mom to finish school. My dad took it horribly and has become bitter and needy. He's delusional about it and claims he left my mom and he's totally fine in regards to the divorce. I knew for a long time that this was coming, but it took my siblings for a bit of a surprise. My dad has always been controlling and selfish and my mom lived a seperate life throughout most of their marriage (that I remember). 

My dad moved about an hour away to live on his sister's property. When he left he caused a pretty big scene. He told us he probably wouldn't be seeing any of us for about 6 weeks so he could adjust. I know he returned to their house the next day, screaming and asking my little sister to pack for him and then offered to show my brother and sister emails between he and my mom that proved she's a cheater. I guess my brother and sister wanted to read it. He left a stack of print outs in an envelop on my porch but I threw it away after reading like 3 emails. 

About 6 months after they separated he started having anxiety attacks. They usually occurred in the car when I was driving him places or we would be in public. I have anxiety and depression, what he does seems fake but I'm not a professional. Any time someone disagrees with him or he's not getting his way he starts taking huge breaths and grabbing his chest and screaming. He says he needs to leave immediately or to stop the car immediately. If I tell him we are almost home he starts pounding on the door. I just stop the car and ignore him. But my siblings (and aunt) will get stressed out and dote on him. Once he gets this he stops. I tried mentioning it to my brother but he kinda got pissed at me and said we need to be helping dad so I dropped it. So this has been going on about a year and a half or so. 

My time is pretty divided up between family but I spend most of my time with my wife and kids. My kids are in sports and band so I feel like a chauffeur most nights after work. Well now my dad calls all of me at least twice a week to take him to the hospital because he's having an attack and he fainted. I've dropped a few events to take him but as soon as he's in a bed and getting attention it stops. I kind of get an attitude now when he calls me for this. My siblings who, one in college and the other has a girlfriend, never seem to want to take him but tell me I'm being selfish if I pass it off to them. My aunt got more involved and she mostly ends up doing it now but he still calls me. I feel like my dad calculates these moments. Sometimes it's 8am on a Sunday or 11pm on a Monday. Holidays and always on my mom's birthday. 

He tells my sister that we need to be taking care of him more and that he had a heart attack from the stress. She cries when he gets like this and my brother is stressed out but mostly avoids family stuff altogether except a few times a year now. 

2 events that tipped me over: 1- we all took a trip to NYC for my dad's 65th in the Spring. He never went and neither have my kids or my sister so we were all excited. We got some Groupon deals for hotels for a night and planned to see sights. We all paid for our own tour bus tickets and had a great time for the first several hours of our trip. The bus let's you off and on so we stopped to see the statue of liberty and eat. My dad wanted to eat something specific but missed the stop. Then he wanted to get a beer but my kids were getting tired and wanted to see the park so he had to do without. My sister got annoyed with my dad when he kept bickering about the kids being cranky. When we got back on the tour bus we sat in the back and my dad started breathing in and out and screaming and slamming fists on the seats. It started quietly but I noticed the progression of intensity. I kept hearing him says, ""oh no! Not now!"" My dad was sitting near my kids and some other kids and started cursing. He screamed ""Jake (me), I need you to get your kids now!"" I went to get them and they seemed frightened. My aunt and sister moved to sit with him. My aunt is praying and they are helping him breathe but I keep hearing him yell that he needs to get off the bus right now. Everyone is staring at us. My wife is embarrassed and so am I. My aunt tells me to ask the driver to stop the bus but he doesn't understand me. We get off at the next stop and my dad is ""weak."" My aunt is helping him and my sister is crying and my kids are too. My brother asks my dad what he needs and he says a beer and we need to go to the hospital. After all this, it's getting dark and my kids are tired and hungry so my wife and I leave and forget the park. My sister and aunt take him to the hospital and my brother takes off. 

2-Last month my brother and his girlfriend are moving in together and my sister is about to go away for school so we wanted to do a dinner to celebrate at a nice restaurant. My dad's treat. My wife wanted to get a babysitter so it was me, wife, dad, brother, brother's girlfriend and sister. My dad starts off ordering 3 appetizers and drinks. My sister seems so happy about college and my wife really likes my brother's girlfriend. She mentions something about meeting my mom and my dad starts obsessing. My sister notices immediately and starts to ask if he's ok. He starts clutching the table and shaking it. The glasses and plates rattle. He says, ""oh no, its coming,"" and starts to let out little yells and people look over. My wife and I get embarrassed. I tell my dad let's go outside and get air and he responds with a yell as he tries to get up, he asks me for assistance to get up and I help him. He starts shaking and yelling in agony. My sister is really upset and follows us. He says he must be having anxiety because my sister is going away and he's so sorry to ruin the night. He then slowly falls to his knee and closes his eyes. The wait staff has constantly been checking in with us and the manager is behind my dad. My dad opens his eyes and screams ambulance! Another night ruined. My dad left in an ambulance and my wife and I footed the bill. I told my aunt and brother that his behavior seems fake and over the top and he's being difficult and he is suddenly fine with attention. The doctors have found nothing physically wrong and refer him to a therapist (which he won't do). My aunt reassured me his symptoms are very real and she remembers the bus incident and my brother shrugs but kind of says yeah but we need to help him. 

My wife agrees with me and this is causing a lot of inconvenience to me.  Am I being an asshole? I'm not getting anywhere with my family and if I stop helping my dad they will be pissed.  Everyone seems to think I'm a huge jerk for my opinion. I love my siblings and they look up to me, especially my sister. I don't want to damage our relationship. But my wife rolls her eyes when my dad calls now and gets annoyed when I go help him especially when it interferes with the kids activities. I'm sick of going out in public or doing things with him.  I've tried talking to a few buddies but they kinda laugh and don't know what to say. Please reddit help me brainstorm my options! Should I be helping my dad when he's in need? 

Tldr: After my parents split up my dad started having over the top pressing anxiety where he calls me and my siblings frequently to take him to the hospital. He has public scenes and ruins family events. I'm sick of it but my family feels bad and wants to help him. I don't want to destroy relations between family but my wife is annoyed.

While I was losing weight, she slowly gained weight. Idk the exact amount, maybe 30 pounds at 5'3. She became very self concious about her weight, and I think part of her resented me for losing weight and getting sort of buff while she was gaining weight. 

&amp;#x200B;

Anyways, we broke up. We were getting into arguments too much, and she kept getting suspicious I was cheating on her to the point where she was following me to and from work. She started drinking nearly every day, gradually getting worse as time went on, and she is a cruel drunk so that was extra bad. She also was taking a lot of xanax. She accused me of lying all the time based on nothing. She just sort of got... crazy, and I felt like no matter what I said to her, she resented me. I don't know where the resentment came from, but it just built up over time. I feel like her weight gain and my weight loss might have something to do with it but I am honestly not sure. Near the end I tried to say as few words as possible to her in general to avoid her getting mad at me. 

&amp;#x200B;

Anyways, when we broke up, she went on a facebook rant about how she hates me and all the men in her life are awful and all this stuff. She kept on mentioning that our relationship was toxic and she wanted out so badly and she feels 'free' now that she broke up with me. That was sort of the first warning sign. I broke up with her, not the other way around. 

&amp;#x200B;

Anyways, quite a bit of time went by, and a friend showed me a post she made on twitter that said ""when your toxic ex boyfriend bullies you for being a short fat girl for a year and makes you feel depressed but your still fabulous"" and then a bunch of other posts about how I was a bully and I was mean to her. One of the posts was ""eric (thats me lol) lost a bunch of weight and suddenly thinks its okay to lash about and emotionally abuse me for being fat even though he was fat just a few months before."" She has a very, very popular twitter, so this blew up pretty quickly. 

&amp;#x200B;

Then she dropped a bombshell on both facebook and twitter the next day, saying that I was abusive and 'ruined her life' and that she never wants to see me again, and that this is a 'warning' for other people who are friends with me that I am abusive and awful. Suddenly I got a bunch of texts and messages from people saying that I was an asshole and that they thought I was a good guy but apparently not etc. I got invited to a party, and the person who invited me had to text me saying I couldn't go anymore because a few girls complained that I was going and they didn't want me there. 

&amp;#x200B;

I had to make a facebook just for this, and I posted that what she said was lies and that I would never do something like that. But... well, I only have 9 friends so far considering I just made the facebook. The past few days have just been me dealing with the backlash of this. 

&amp;#x200B;

The worst part is that now its really opening my eyes the level of hatred she had for me. I mean I lived for months in fear that she was going to just go on a furious outburst at me over nothing. I can't believe I stayed with her during those times. I should have seen this coming. She bullied me, not the other way around. Looking back at how horrible and frankly terrifying her behavior was... ugh. 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm not really sure what to do. I am kind of a shy timid guy (thats what comes with being fat for your whole life..) and I try to avoid controversy as much as possible and now its come to my doorstep. 

&amp;#x200B;

any advice?

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR - - Me and my girlfriend broke up and she wrote a post saying I bullied her for being fat. "
"My (28F) friend sent me a snapchat of my fiancé (30M) at the bar with another woman.


My fiancé Tim and I have been together (renting) for four years. We have a wedding date set and planned for next year. He has been so supportive and engaged in planning and everyday tells me how much I mean to him. We just booked a week long vacation after two weeks of getting our work schedules figured out.

He called me from work saying some some friends surprised him and they're going out. No worries babe have fun. He did not extend an invitation which I didn't think anything of, but I don't feel well so I stayed home. I texted him a little bit ago saying I'm going to bed, didn't hear back, but again it is a nonissue. 

I woke up to my friend Gwen calling me. She told me to check my snapchat, which I did.

She sent me a video of him and a girl wrapped all over each other. They were laughing and he was touching her face and playing with her hair. I'm crushed. My chest feels hollow. I want to scream and cry and throw things but I'm sitting here on my bed with no idea what to do. Gwen left the bar and said she is coming over which I'm so grateful for. And it was at a bar I have been wanting to go to for a long time. Whatever that means anymore.

What do I do? I'm so confused. 

TL;DR: friend sent me a video of my fiancé at the bar with another woman."
"I [28F] caught my husband [31M] of 5 months cheating on while on a trip with two of his friends. They both are cheating on their SOs as well.


My husband has been in Las Vegas with two of his friends since Friday.  I've been following the trip on their Instagrams.  It's mostly just food pics and other touristy shots. They left on Friday and are supposed to return on Saturday. 

On Sunday night, one of his friends posted a selfie eating fish tacos at a restaurant. While looking at the post, I noticed the location was listed, so I clicked it and a full page of other people who have posted there showed up. That's when I noticed something weird.

I saw a picture of my husband, but it wasn't from his or his friends' pages. I clicked on the username, and was shocked to find a lot of pictures of my husband. After looking through it, it was clear this was his Instagram page that he kept private from me. 

I didn't care initially. I just figured he wanted some privacy from me, which I didn't have a problem with, but then I came across some concerning comments under one of his pics. One in particular  was from a woman saying that he needed to come party with her again. 

I became concerned, so I made a blank profile and followed their pages so I could look at their stories. In one articular video that my husband took, it showed his friend sitting on a hotel bed with what looked like an escort. Another video showed him making out with a different woman earlier in the night.

I then looked at his friend's stories, and it showed my husband groping and getting a lap dance from a different woman who also appeared to be an escort. They're were also videos of them all taking body shots and smoking.

I'm haven't confronted them yet, but I've taken screenshots and recorded the stories. I'm not sure what I'm going to do about my own relationship because I've only been married for five months, and I'm also not sure what to do about his friends. They are both married as while. I'm not really close with their wives so I'm not sure if I should get involved with their relationships. 

**TL;DR** I caught my husband and his to friends cheating while on vacation. Not sure what to do since I recently got married, and I'm not sure if I should tell his friends' wives.

"Roommates [19M, 20M] NEVER cook, eat my[20F] food and make me feel guilty when I don’t cook for them


So we’re all college students who live together in a shared house and everyone has their own rooms. 

I was raised by two chefs so I love cooking. When we first moved in together I made a meal for all of us to share together as a way of getting to know each other and just trying to be hospitable. What I didn’t know at the time was that I would be expected to become the official cooking lady as of that moment. 

Whereas I usually make dishes that require cooking and actual preparation, they usually stock up on various snacks as their fill for the week. 

We each do our own grocery shopping and I usually buy things I know I can cook and cook well. These guys usually buy a bizarre mix of things and somehow turn it into a meal. A typical dinner for them would be something like popcorn with oranges and lemonade. Even though I get offered to join in on such delicacies each time, I usually decline and prefer to make my own food. Whenever I do start to make my own food, which often smells amazing thanks to my above average cooking skills, I’m always expected to share and put out a plate for everyone. Now I don’t mind sharing food, but it’s just unsustainable to do on a student budget every single day. 

I sometimes just make enough food for myself and go eat it in my room. I’m often made to feel guilty for doing this because right afterwards they’ll whip up a quick meal of peanut butter and grapes and offer it to me just to make sure I realize that I’m being selfish by just cooking for myself and not offering them anything. They mostly eat out but whenever they do eat at home, they prefer to eat their bizarre concoctions together and always offer me some as well. 

One of the two roommates is actually the worst of the two. He rarely ever buys any groceries and always freeloads on the other guy. He eats out almost always and only stops when his money runs out then starts eating the other guy’s food only to restart the cycle again when his money comes in. 

I honestly don’t know how to deal with this situation as I’ve never encountered it before. Any advice is welcome.


TLDR: Roommates never cook and expect me to always feed them. They make me feel guilty whenever I don’t

"I [32F] need to tell my husband [33M] that my BIL [30M] kissed me


Last night my husband and I were supposed to go to a family dinner at his parents' house, but he wasn't feeling well and had to work early this morning and decided not to go. I am close with my MIL and SIL so he encouraged me to go without him.   
Nothing weird or out of the ordinary happened at the dinner party. I just chatted with family and had a nice time. Eventually my ILs wanted to go to bed and my SIL was leaving so I got up to leave. My BIL offered to drive me home (our car has been unreliable lately so I ubered there). I've always found him little awkward but nothing bad about him and he is my husband's brother so I figured it was fine.

We just chatted in the car home. It was flirty or anything. I was talking to him just like I talk to a friend. He parks outside my house and then yells ""wait"" as I'm getting out of the car. He starts telling me that he's been in love with me for years and he asks me to leave my husband. I tell him no and go to get out of the car, but he grabs my face and kisses me. I tried to pull my he'd away but couldn't because he was holding it and I just froze. When he let go I jumped out of the car and booked it into the house.

My husband left for work before I woke up this morning so I haven't seen him but I need to tell him what happened. His brother is blowing up my phone about our ""amazing night."" I don't know what to do. I keep trying to figure out how this could have happened and what I did to lead him on. I feel like trash like I cheated on my husband. How do I tell him? What can I say?

tl;dr my BIL confessed his love for me and kissed me and I have to tell my husband"
"My girlfriend [32F] yelled at me [28F] for painting incorrectly and made me feel really bad about myself. I can't get it out of my head.


 My girlfriend and I are going to be moving into a condo, but it needs some renovations. My girlfriend’s mom is a contractor with her own construction/reno company, so we’ve hired her to do the big stuff and we do the less complicated things ourselves (with my gf’s mom’s guidance). 


Last week, we started painting the walls. We don’t have too much experience painting – my gf painted her bedroom maybe 10 years ago, and I helped my parents paint the garage around 10 years ago too. My girlfriend called up her mom and asked her for tips on how to paint properly. They spoke on the phone (I couldn’t hear what they were saying) and my gf told me the instructions after. Her exact words, more or less “Paint in a W shape, then keep doing a W shape to fill in and blend the rest of the space”. Okay. I started off with the brush painting the corners and around the tape, and my girlfriend used the big roller to do the rest of the walls. After she was done about ½ of a wall, she asked me if we could switch because her arm hurt. 


So I pick up the roller, put on some paint, and make a W. That’s it. All of a sudden, I hear “What the fuck are you doing? That W is too big. I sectioned off my wall in a specific way and now you messed it up. You’re supposed to do it \*this\* way. Yours looks like shit. Have you ever even painted before?? And why did you even start your paint on MY wall. Why wouldn’t you start on a new wall? And you have too much paint on your roller! You’re fucking doing it all wrong, you’re only supposed to have THIS much paint on your roller. Look at my section of the wall compared to what you just did. Now it looks so bad.”


For a second, I was speechless. How could I have screwed up SO BADLY after painting for about 5 seconds? Why was she yelling at me! I felt like her words were so condescending and I actually started to cry (I cry when I’m overwhelmed, not necessarily because I’m sad/upset. This is something I’ve told my gf numerous times over the years). So I asked her if she wanted to do the painting instead and she said “No, just keep going”. So I reluctantly start going again, but she is watching my every move and judging me, telling me each step that I’m doing something wrong. And then saying things like “You know it works if you do it \*this\* way, right?”. Well… no, I didn’t know that because no one ever told me… And you know what, the part that she painted didn’t even look that amazing… Plus it was the first coat of primer!


I just keep going with my painting in silence, trying to do it correctly based on the instructions she was yelling at me. I’m still crying a bit and my gf says “What. Now I’ve upset you? You told me that you wanted me to criticize you so that’s what I did. And now you’re mad and upset”. I told her that I wasn’t upset, I was just overwhelmed. And then she kept saying “I KNOW you’re upset. I can tell. Stop lying to me. Grow up and learn how to control your emotions.” I just say “okay” and keep painting. I really wasn’t upset/angry, I just don’t like being yelled at. But she kept telling me “I KNOW you’re upset. You’re upset, I can tell. Stop being upset” and THAT was upsetting me!


We had some friends coming over to help and they arrived maybe 5 minutes later and gf got all happy and bubbly and it’s like nothing even happened. I didn’t really want to paint with the roller anymore after that, so I just grabbed the paint brush and continued to do that since she didn’t criticize me for that.


It’s been about a week now, but I keep thinking about her reaction. I just can’t imagine how I could have done such an awful job that I deserved to be yelled at. The other weird thing too is that she’s a teacher, so I feel like she should be better at explaining new concepts to others…I don’t know, am I overreacting and should I just let the whole thing go? I know for sure I don’t want to paint in front of her ever again.


  
  ---   
  **tl;dr**: My gf and I are painting our condo. She asked her mom for advice on how to do it and then told me what she learned. I tried to do it and got yelled at saying that what I had done was shitty and we shouldn't paint together."
"My [19M] college roommate [18M] is getting married to his girlfriend of 3 months. I think it's a terrible idea, and he overheard my girlfriend [18F] talking negatively about it.


My roommate and I are sophomores in college and share an off-campus apartment.

&amp;#x200B;

My roommate has very limited dating experience, but at his summer job (approximately 3 months ago), he met his current girlfriend. I've only seen her a couple times, and tried making conversation but she didn't respond well (she's Brazilian, English is her second language), and it seemed like they wanted to be left alone. Since I don't know anything about her or their relationship, I don't have an opinion on either of them.

&amp;#x200B;

I do know, however, that my roommate's parents are strict Koreans, and he's currently hiding the relationship from his father (who would strongly disapprove of an interracial relationship), while his mother knows and only mildly disapproves.

&amp;#x200B;

The past weekend I was away and we had the following text exchange:

\&gt;Him: ""yo I just got engaged""

\&gt;Me: ""haha wtf, are you fucking w me?""

\&gt;Him: ""na, I'll tell you in person""

&amp;#x200B;

The next night, my girlfriend was staying over and while she was in the shower, I had the following conversation with him:

\&gt;Me"" ""wait so what was the thing about getting engaged?""

\&gt;Him: ""yeah it's real. we're planning the wedding for May. Don't tell anyone about it though""&gt;Me: ""Damn. Uh, why and how?""

\&gt;Him: ""Why? Because I love her. And how? I asked her and she said yes.""

&amp;#x200B;

At this point I had \*plenty\* of other questions to ask, but it was past midnight and wanted to jump into the shower, so I left it.

&amp;#x200B;

I jumped into the shower and told my girlfriend that it was legitimate, and he was really getting engaged. I know I was probably wrong to tell her, but

a) she already knew about it, since she knew about the initial text message (which didn't mention anything being secret), and

b) she hasn't (and will never) see or meet his parents, so there isn't a risk of word spreading to them (assuming that's the main reason why it's a secret).

&amp;#x200B;

While in the shower, she was going off about how illogical and ridiculous the whole engagement was. She was making harsh, but accurate statements that I mostly agreed with. She mentioned how he's a sophomore in a rigorous major (MechE) who plans on going to graduate school, how his parents will essentially disown him if they're truly strict Asians, and especially how he's 18 and they've known each other for three months.

&amp;#x200B;

I agreed with all of her points, but tried to keep quiet in case he overheard. And sure enough, when I left the bathroom, he called me into his room and was furious (yes, he spoke to me and not her). He didn't seem necessarily upset that I told her, but was more upset that he could hear her trash-talking the engagement ""ten feet from his bed"", in his ""own house"" which he ""pays for equally"". In my opinion it seems like he was probably eavesdropping, in which case is destined for hurt feelings and hearing things you weren't supposed to. If I locked my friends in a room at the beginning of my relationship and pressed my ear to the door, I'm sure I'd hear some negative things too.

&amp;#x200B;

I agree with all of her points. ""Love"" (or whatever that means at 3 months) isn't enough. In three months, they've probably never fought, never made-up, haven't lived together, or even know each other's living habits. Not to mention the other glaringly obvious problems with getting married so young (while still in undergrad) and so soon.

&amp;#x200B;

It's not my relationship and for the most part I don't care. However, now there's a problem and I'm wondering how it should be addressed. My roommate is pretty closed off and holds a huge grudge, so imo an apology won't make a difference and it's best to just drop it, but she says it would be for her own benefit more than his. And it probably wouldn't hurt, at least.

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR: Roommate making a pretty irrational and terrible life decision, normally not my problem but he eavesdropped on me/my gf being a dick. What do I do?

&amp;#x200B;

Thoughts? Thanks a ton"
"My [16F] brother [18M] is dying. He likes having attention from us but I don’t think I can handle it anymore


My brother has an ingerited disease which is really negatively affecting to the pount where doctors say that he only has a few weeks left to live. He is at home with us but he has a nurse with him all the time. My parents are really hurt over this too but they are more emotionally strong than I am. 

I go to school early and get out pretty early so I’m home a lot. He and I had a great relationship/friendship before his disorder got really bad. Now it’s realy affevting him to the point where he can barely talk and he gets confused and really emotional. Whenever I’m home he calls me a lot and crys and tries to have a conversation with me even though you can barely understand his words.

When I try to hang out with him, he gets confused and starts calling for my mom and starts crying. I can’t handle seeing him like this. I came here to get this off my chest and if you guys could maybe give me some pointers as to what I should do?

TL:DR Brother is dying and I can’t handle seeing him in his current condition"
"My (25F) seemingly perfect husband (28M) was rubbing it out to his ex, soliciting prostitutes the whole time we were celebrating our second wedding anniversary. Totally blindsided. What are my next steps?


Husband and I have been together for six years, living together for four and married for two. Things have been consistently good the whole time - mutual goals, we spend lots of time together and talk about everything, regular sex... I honestly thought I knew him in and out and that we were perfect for each other. Every day he tells me how much he loves me and how beautiful he thinks I am and every day I think how lucky I am to have him. 

Last weekend was our second wedding anniversary. We took a few extra days off to go on a road trip and honestly the whole weekend was a blast. Nothing seemed off. Last night after he went to bed I was cleaning and found a pair of worn panties behind the couch. They are definitely not mine or any of my friends or family’s and no one else has access to our house. Neither of us use each other’s phones often but aren’t overly protective about them. I’ve never had the slightest urge to snoop before but last night I wound up checking his browser history and my heart sank.

First I found a shit ton of porn which doesn’t bother me, everyone needs to rub one out now and then. But all of it was... mature brunette ladies which I am not. Not a huge deal.

Sandwiched between all the porn was a TON of searches of his ex. Some on revenge porn sites. I don’t imagine he took a break from rubbing one out to look for her out of curiosity. She is mature and a brunette.

The last thing I found was looking up escort services in the cities we were road tripping through. The only profiles he clicked on were mature brunettes. From the looks of his phone history he called at least one.

This was all from the last week. 6/7 days we’ve been together the whole time. Sleeping beside each other. And with each other. I’m so blindsided by this. I haven’t seen him since I found this out, he’s left on a fishing trip with his dad until Sunday night (I know this is true because I heard him and his dad talking about it). So he has no idea I know. I seriously thought we were great together but this is fucked. I don’t think there’s anything in the world that could ever let me look him in the eyes the same. Even if nothing physical happened which I doubt... I couldn’t do it. I will never feel like I’m sexually enough for him again. 

So what the hell are my next steps? I truly never thought I’d be in this position. So far I have:

Took a pic of the history on my phone.

Wrote break up letter. Maybe not to give to him but for my own mental clarity.

Have appointment with doctor and lawyer next week.

Any advice or anecdotes are so appreciated. Our whole lives are enmeshed together. I don’t know what his reaction will be when I confront him. He’s not violent but I don’t know how he’ll react. I am heartbroken.

TL;DR found out husband was rubbing it out his ex, looking for prostitutes while on a road trip with me. Mysterious panties found. Haven’t confronted him yet. Totally blindsided. Where do I go from here?

"I reacted very poorly to my birthday gift from my husband. How do I make this up to him?


It was my 30th birthday last week. My husband has been asking me what I would like, and he joked about getting one specific item multiple times (it's very expensive, and I have huge hangups about money ..I'm working on that). I told him every time that I would really not like that as a gift, and no gift at all would be just fine (I love little things like cards and a nice breakfast, which we do every year).  

 He bought me that item and gave it to me at 7am. I had slept terribly, and our one year old woke us up at 6am. I was busy making her breakfast, and hadn't yet had my coffee, so I was tired and hungry. It's not an excuse, but an explanation.  I started crying(lol) and told him that it was thoughtless of him to get this because now I'll stress out about it, and we suck at communicating because I clearly said I didn't want this. There was more, but that's the gist of it. He was super apologetic, and said that he would return it and to not worry about it. He said that he wanted to spoil me, because I never spend that much on myself. 

I feel awful, Reddit. My husband is an amazing guy, he works very hard, and he is the nicest person you'll ever meet. He didn't say anything about it, but I know I really hurt him. I apologized later, but how do I make this up to him? 

**TL;DR:** I reacted horribly to my birthday gift from my husband, how do I make it up to him?"
"Me [32 M] with my GF [29 F] 1 year, her parents are embarrassing to eat dinner with in public and aren’t much better in private.


I’m not sure if I should suck it up, have GF say something to her parents, or just stop accepting dinner invites. 

I guess I’ll start with a little background. GF’s parents live nearby and are very generous to offer to take us out to and pay for dinner. The problem is, her mom is extremely anxious and micromanages GF’s dad to an embarrassing and weird extent. The dad has his own issues as well. Some examples:

* We were eating at a Mexican restaurant and instead of letting dad eat the chips and salsa she would scoop salsa onto chips and place them on the table in front of him. She would refill this any time he was low so it wasn’t even working to portion control. As you can imagine, this made a huge mess on the table. 

* Mom insists on splitting glasses of wine instead of getting their own glasses, even when they order multiple glasses. She will pour half sloppily into a second glass. 

* Dad ordered queso fundido app as an entree - this particular restaurant does it as a melted hard cheese with a sprinkle of veggies/meat. He complained to the waiter that there weren’t enough vegetables in the dish. 

* GF and dad decided to order an appetizer to split. Mom scolded dad for eating it. Actually she scolds him if he eats any of the shared food - chips, bread, appetizers, etc. 

* Mom has gone so far as to slap dad’s hand away if he reaches for anything she doesn’t approve of. One dinner she spilled 3 glasses doing this. 1 full glass of water/ice and 2 glasses of wine. When this happens she doesn’t notify the waiter so he walks by, sees ice all over the table, and gives a wtf look and starts cleaning it up. 

* Since Mom only lets dad order small dishes or appetizers, he is often hungry afterwards and complains there wasn’t enough food. He will then start in on anything edible left on the table - butter packets, salad dressing sides, etc, generally using his fingers to get to every last drop. 

* Every conversation is about mom’s anxieties of future events. ‘You need to find an apartment (I’m not moving for 3 months, places don’t even list that far out.) “What are you going to do about your dogs on X trip?” (I have a regular sitter.) “Are you sure you’re going to get vacation time at your new time to take a trip?” (X trip was scheduled prior to getting the job and yes, I’ll have vacation.) “If you can’t go, I could go in your place.” (Wut) 

These are just events from the last 2 dinners. I’ve taken to avoiding accepting dinner invites because it is both unpleasant and embarrassing. This also leaves out most of the non-dinner dysfunction but that’s easier to deal with. 

TL;DR GF’s parents have embarrassing dinner habits and are not enjoyable company. Should I just stop accepting invites? Say something? Or keep my mouth shut. "
"I (24F) broke up with my boyfriend (24M) and I don’t feel bad about it. However my friends and family think I should.


I was with my (now ex) boyfriend Jake for 8 years. He was honestly a really great boyfriend. Everyone, Jake, and myself, all figured we would get married and have a family together. He and I were your standard happy couple. 

You’re probably wondering why I decided to break up with him. 

We were happy. Key word being: were. Jake and I went through a lot together in the 8 years. We had your usual ups and downs. 

I struggled a lot with my self-esteem and that hurt our relationship sometimes. Jake would often “like” really sexy pictures of girls we knew and just random strangers online. I spent years struggling with my self-esteem because I would compare myself to the women he “liked” on social media. Jake would reassure me by telling me it was harmful admiration from a distance. He never pursued talking to these girls in any form and if he did talk to them, it was always platonic. Over the years of him continuing his behavior of “liking” photos and reassuring me, I started to believe in his words and place more value in myself. 

Pretty great, right? We both trusted each other at this point. I felt more secure in our relationship and myself as a person. 

Well, I realized through this process of trusting him and learning self-love that I was actually envious of these girls for posting pictures like the ones Jake “liked”. I wanted to do the same. I wanted to do some fun modeling pictures as a hobby. 

Of course I discussed this with Jake from the beginning. He was completely on board. He loved it! And unfortunately, over time, he grew to not love it. 

I began getting attention online through my pictures. I started getting a lot of “likes” and really flirty comments and messages. I never responded to any comments or messages from guys. I would block accounts that pushed the messages too far. Jake would see all of the public comments and he would sometimes ask to see my private messages. I would always show them to him whenever he asked because I knew I had nothing to hide. Like I said, I never replied to them. He would just see that I would get compliments and that I would just block people that went too far. 

But even then that never really reassured him. He seemed afraid that I was either cheating or that I was going to dump him for some guy trying to pick me up online. 

And at this point though, he was still “liking” other pictures of girls. Pictures that were more revealing than mine (no shame towards those lovely ladies though). 

So, I asked him: Why is it okay for you to “like” these photos of other women but it’s not okay for me to post mild modeling photos? 

His answer was again: he was admiring from a distance and never tried to make contact with them. He viewed me as “displaying myself as bait for flirty compliments.” And it really hurt my feelings when he said that. To claim that I was posting pictures of myself to draw in other men. When he knew that this was something I wanted to do for myself. I wasn’t even doing it for him. So why would I do it for other men? 

After that argument, we went to bed separately. In the middle of the night I decided to check his phone because that was something I never did before. I never felt the need to confirm that he was actually having platonic conversations with the girls he “liked.” But just from his accusations and his acidic words towards me... it made me suspicious that he may be accusing me of things he’s guilty of. 

And my fears were proven correct. Jake had been sending really suggestive and flirty messages to other girls. He was even doing it the night prior to that big fight we had. He very rarely got a response but sometimes he did. It would turn into a short and hot conversation and that was that. I couldn’t see anything that indicated that he wanted to meet these women in real life or vice versa. 

It really broke my heart. I felt like he was being incredibly hypocritical and insensitive. He spent years telling me he was just admiring from afar and didn’t try talking to them. He spent years lying to me. I put aside all of my insecurities for him and us and it was for nothing. 

So I broke up with him. 

Friends and family caught wind of the news super fast. They’ve been telling me how selfish it was that I “chose modeling over my 8 year long relationship.” 

That’s not how I view it though. I broke up with someone that had been lying to me for years. I broke up with someone that couldn’t support something that made me feel better about myself. I broke up with someone that didn’t trust me when I gave him all of the evidence that I was still holding up my end on being committed and honest. 

So, now I’m coming to Reddit for validation because everyone I currently know is shaming me for my decision. Was I wrong for leaving Jake? 

TL;DR: Dealt with my own insecurities of my boyfriend “liking” sexy pictures online of other girls. Grew past them and got into the modeling scene myself. Boyfriend accused me of fishing for flirty messages from other guys. I then found out he had been sending flirty messages to other girls. So I broke up with me. Family and friends are now calling me selfish for dumping him. Are they right?"
"My (25M) girlfriend (27F) wants me to change my phone number, so that no girls that previously had my phone number, have it anymore. Is she right for asking this?


Hi,
So my gf wants me to change my phone number, because she wants no other girls to have my phone number. I have never cheated on her, I have never texted a girl while we were together besides family, and I have never given her a reason to think that I’m doing anything shady or messed up behind her back. She knows all of this, and her reasoning is that no female should have my number. She is not reasoning with me here and basically gave me an ultimatum, either I change my number or she leaves. I don’t know what to do. I would appreciate input from you guys. 

Tl;dr: my girlfriend gave me an ultimatum and I don’t know what to do."
"My (34m) “friend” (30m) likes and acts inappropriately towards my girlfriend (27f) and it’s annoying me.


Tl;dr : this guy in our circle of friends has the hots for my gf, he’s always complimenting and hitting on her, he’s asked her out on a private date, and he’s berated me in front of our friends.  I think he’s trying to get close so he can be a rebound.  How can I get this ass-hat to fuck off?  

I can’t believe I have to deal with such a stupid problem.  Within my own circle of friends none the less.  

My (34m) friend Alex (30-ish male) has been creepy and progressively getting worse with his crush on my girlfriend. 

At first I didn’t care.  A lot of people find my girlfriend attractive, no biggie.  The first time he met her, he made comments about how he loves girls that wear chokers and how sexy they are.  My girlfriend’s signature look is wearing chokers.  Like I said, no biggie, I even said how much I love that my gf wears chokers too and we carried on the conversation about how sexy they were, made jokes about them, etc...  but something about his body language or maybe it was the way he was talking gave me the feeling that he was attracted to her.  I mentioned it to my gf later that night that I think Alex likes you.   We both agreed that that was crazy and unlikely.  

Since then, he’s always sought her out in group settings and has been excessively nice to her, he also compliments her way too much.  He’s not like that with anybody else in the group. He’s now also going out of his way to bring special foods and gifts to every group gathering, something he hasn’t done before.  While out,   he buys her drinks, forces her into pictures she doesn’t want to be in, then gets close and puts his arm around her for the picture. 

He only does this when I’m working and my friends come in to see me at work, so I’m busy when he pulls these shenanigans, but I can still see it happening.  

They’re both foodies while I am not.  He panders to her foodie-ness a lot.  Always commenting on her posts, sending dms, private messages, etc... just trying to get closer to her.  

The incidents that really started to bug me and get under my skin was when a bunch of us were out at lunch and he started to shit on me for my numerous food allergies.  He said “as a foodie, don’t you have to be a certain level of charming and handsome to put up with somebody like bigchipshi?  idk how you put up with that.  I wouldn’t be able to.”  He continued this act for at least another hour.  A friend eventually chimed in and got him to stop.  

Another time at the nightclub I work at, he got drunk and tried to dance with her.  He came up from behind her and tried to put his hands on her shoulders and grind up on her.  My gf side stepped it.  Nobody else saw this and my Gf doesn’t remember it happening.  She also doesn’t think that Alex likes her, just that he’s a nice and sweet guy.  

At this point I’m still in disbelief that all of this is actually happening and I’m trying to convince myself that I’m overreacting.  My friend wouldn’t do shady stuff like this to me, right?.  

Then on July 4th at a bbq, after his usual compliments of her hair, choker, etc... he got excited when another friend made a joke that I wouldn’t be joining the group on a trip to Las Vegas, but that my Gf would be.  He jumped off the table and high fived my gf, saying “he’ll yeah let’s go, let’s do this, you don’t need bigchipshi.  Are you really going?  Let’s go!”

Later, as we were saying goodbye at the bbq, he pulled my gf to the side to talk one on one (I was busy cleaning up) and asked her to be his foodie partner on this new foodie blog he’s starting up.  He wants it to be just him and her, weekly meetups, he’ll pay for her, and “don’t tell bigchipshi”.  He still hasn’t even started anything remotely close to a foodie blog.  

Then as my gf went to get her stuff, he comes to talk to me and says we need to hang out more, just the guys, and “fuck (gf’s name), let’s go drink together”.  

She tells me on the ride home that Alex just asked her out.  Now she finally believes me when I say that he likes her.  She’s in disbelief and cant believe that somebody would do this, especially a mutual friend.  

I’ve stopped talking to him completely, I’m cordial if I have to be, but I avoid him at all costs.  I don’t trust myself to not get angry and snap at whatever stunt he tries to pull next.

I have no proof of anything, just stories of possibly creepy behavior that can go either way.  I feel like if I confront him now, he can just deny all of my accusations then he’ll make me out to be the jealous boyfriend. 

None of my friends really believe me, I’ve told a few close friends about it but they think I’m overreacting.  That Alex is just friendly like that.  But they’ll keep an eye on him for if and when he tries to pull anything else.  

I don’t want to start drama or rumors, but I’m tired of Alex’s games. How do I deal with this scheezy friend?  My gf doesn’t want to get involved.  

Also, I just remembered that there were two instances when Alex became the shoulder to cry on for a couple girls in our group who were dealing with breakups.  He dated both of them on the down low for a little bit.  Not one fuck given about the ex-boyfriends.

"SIL (21F) living with me (23F) and my husband (24M) is wearing out her welcome


My husband and I invited his sister to live with us after we found out she was depressed in her college town. She had dropped out, and it was a small town, so not a lot going for her there.


She got a good job in our city, and we were supposed to be helping her learn to be more responsible, so we charge rent. We decided that since we're not her parents (even though they helped set this up), we wouldn't make any rules, other than ask that she let us know when her boyfriend is coming to stay. (Even that only came up because he moved in for a week early on with his dog, with no heads up to us- our house is pretty small, so 4 adults and 4 animals is kind of a lot to share a bathroom haha).


So now, we're kind of fed up with some things that seem disrespectful to us, and know it's probably our fault for not being more clear in the beginning. We just need to know how to address it going forward without damaging relationships. (Husband is concerned SIL will throw a tantrum and try to start family drama.)


- She's already a month behind on rent, as she didn't pay for her first month up front, but now she's not paying on the due date.


- No heads up is given when boyfriend is coming to stay, and they smoke weed inside. We've asked that be done outside.


- Her bedroom is so filthy, we will have to have the carpet replaced and have a professional cleaning crew come in. Her dog has taken care of business many times on the bed, and the mattress was not cleaned (our brand new mattress). Our dishes are piling up in there with crusty food, and there are kitchen sized bags of trash everywhere. Her room is making our whole house smell and we're concerned about insects. (The dog is another issue. We feel bad for him too, but don't know how to handle that without destroying relationships. He's a sensitive subject).


There's quite a few more, but we're trying to walk a line of understanding that roommates always live differently and not overreact, but we'd like our home and space respected. We're kinda feeling like we live with a teenager.


We know we need to start with some communication that this isn't okay; how would y'all address it?  Thank you!!

Tl;dr: We're tired of our roommate but are trying to be fair to her"
"I [33/M] work with my best friend’s [34/M] wife [30/F]. It has ruined the entire friendship. How can I fix this?


  

My best friend and I have known each other since before university – we’ve been friends for going on 17 years. We’ve always had a great relationship. I was best man at his wedding and I was always very friendly and close with his wife. I was the only one who helped them move into their house and then paint their new place. 

About 6 months ago I was contacted on LinkedIn about a job – I knew my friend’s wife worked there so I asked her about it. She told me how great it was and I should apply. The job is in her division but not directly related. I applied and got the job – I had two interviews and it was done. I started and almost immediately my friend’s wife iced me out. She didn’t say hi, she would decline meeting requests, she began to eat her lunch in an area where no one could find her, she would start entering through back doors to avoid seeing us. I couldn’t make plans with my friend and she just wouldn’t acknowledge me in public. She would even have colleagues tell her if I was nearby so she could be somewhere else. 

I found out that she also applied for the job. Thing is, she doesn’t have the experience, education or credentials for the role. She is an executive assistant, so it would be unlikely even under the best of circumstances. She has worked there since she finished her associate’s degree (so about 8 years) and felt it was her time for a promotion. The job is a senior leadership role – I have employees and she reports to one of my employees. Her being upset doesn’t make a lot of sense to me. But, I can’t seem to reach her. She won’t respond to texts and she goes to great lengths to hide from me at work. 

I get that she is annoyed she didn’t get the job, but she basically ruined my friendship because she’s annoyed. Trying to be the bigger person, I want to get everyone’s opinion on how I should mend fences and try and fix this so that I can get back to spending time with my friend. 

&amp;#x200B;

tl;dr I work with friends wife and she is mad I got the job and she didn't. She iced me out and I want to see how I can mend fences to get my friend back. "
"UPDATE: Soon I will have sex, but my period will get in the way. How to talk to BF about that?


update to: [https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/9hid62/soon\_i\_will\_have\_sex\_but\_my\_period\_will\_get\_in/](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/9hid62/soon_i_will_have_sex_but_my_period_will_get_in/)

TL;DR for the original post: I (F19) plan to lose my virginity on a planned trip but I will be having my period. What to do?

Last night we had a date so I (F19) told him (M19) that I would be on my period the weekend we planned to go to a football game. He immediately told me that his sister usually had cramps and discomfort during her period, and suggested sitting through a football game might not be comfortable for me. He pointed out that in the stadium at that college the area for visiting students was small and seating was rather tight and suggest that we not go. He has apparently talked with his sister about periods and bought pads for her and tampons for his mother at the drugstore. It was the first time I had talked to a guy about periods, so I was nervous at first but became very comfortable talking to him.

We decided that we would not go to that game and but watch it on TV. Instead, we are going to another away game the following Saturday. We are going to get a room at a very nice hotel in that town for that evening (both of us had stayed there before with our families when we were touring prospective colleges). That hotel has a good indoor pool and is next door to a very nice restaurant. So we have decided to get one room there and stay together.

I told him that I might not feel ready to have intercourse with him that night, he said that he would be OK with that but he hopes I will feel like it. (I am sure I will!) It does feel strange that I know that on a particular night a few weeks from now, and in a particular place, we will be losing our virginities. However, I guess that in the past that was more normal (girls losing their virginity on their wedding night after planning the wedding and honeymoon months in advance).

At least I have something to look forward to.

TL;DR I talked to my BF about periods and we postponed the trip"
"My husband (35) and I (25) are thinking about kicking out our niece (18) but I don't think she will make it in the real world.


My husband (35) and his sister (37) have had a conflict for the last five years and are not on speaking terms. However, prior to this conflict they had an okay relationship and he spent a lot of time with his niece (now 18).  


His sister is extremely strict and has a lot of conflict with her children. Some examples are that his niece had to sit in time out at age 17 for up to an hour and a half at a time, could not attend school functions like football games and dances, and was punished for stealing food if she ate outside of mealtimes. Obviously, weird.   


As soon as his niece turned 18, she moved out and in with an older friend of the family. The older friend kicked my husband's niece out within a week due to her being ""too immature"".

His niece asked her mom if she could move back in but her mom said no.

Next the niece calls us. Some background: we live about five miles out of town. We have a toddler and I am currently pregnant. We survive on one income because I am a stay at home mom. Money is tight but we manage. My husband often has to leave for several weeks at a time for work. We had a room I used for art, I gave it up to let his niece move in. (She promised it was only temporary)    


She moves in. I help her register for college. She decides that she wants to take a CNA class so she will have more earning potential while she is a college student. The problem is the CNA class is not covered by financial aid. I help her make the first payment and she promises to pay me back.

Where we live there is no public transportation and the college is about 7 miles away. She does not have a car but does have a bike. I agree to let her use my car to go to school because I want her to be successful but it means me being without a car during those hours.

She was working part time 10 miles away. My husband and I convinced her to find a job closer to us. She finds one within walking distance.

One day, I walk into her room and see a bottle of otc allergy pills spilled all over the floor. My toddler has eaten some but I have no idea how many. We call poision control and be ends up being okay but it was still super scary. My husband has a talk with her about having a safe house for toddlers. Our cat door is in the window to her room so I have into her room to feed our cat. Two times I have found pill bottles without lids and one time there was zoloft poured out all over her dresser. We are pissed and confused. What is the motive? Each time she is confronted she acts shocked like she cant believe she did it. My husband told her if it happens again she will be kicked out. A new rule is set that pills are never allowed to be outside one designated cabinet.  

I keep catching her in little lies. She borrows the car without asking. One time she had friends over and they were being loud at one in the morning. I told her that her friends needed to leave and she says okay but they are still there in the morning.

She asks if she can adopt a dog. We say no. Then i go in her room a few days later and there is a kitten. She told me this story about how she found it. I told her that cat had to go. She then admits she adopted it.

My husband finally had vacation time so my family left our niece at our house for a week and a half. We told her no people over, keep the house clean, use the car for school only. We are anxious about leaving her but tell each other it will be okay.  

When we get home there is a guy over smoking weed in our house with weed all over our living room table, our house is trashed, there is a dog staying at our house, dog shit all over the floor, our sheets are off our bed, our toddlers toys are destroyed, etc. I sell vintage clothes online and I can see that my merch has been gone through. I found some things of mine in her room. I had to inactivate my shop because I have to figure out what is all missing.

We tell her she can no longer have friends over at our house. We make her clean the house and dont really know what to do. 

She admits that she dropped out of school while we were gone. She pretends for the next week that she still has her job but we call her out because we never saw her go to it. Suddenly, she is doing nothing. We had orginally agreed to let her live rent free if she was a student. My husband made her sign a paper saying she would pay rent by the first of the month and would be evicted if she is 30 days late. She has NO money at all and does not seem to be looking for a job.

This is the thing. She has no life skills. When she gets money she spends it on clothes/makeup immediately. Her friend and her recently gave their bank account info to a random dude on the internet because he promised to give them $200 a day to be his ""sugar babies"". They don't believe me that its a scam. She is not motivated to work full time. She has mental health history and issues. I think she may have some developmental disabilities. She is extremely immature, does not function like the average person her age, and has trouble following multi step directions, understanding her actions have consquences, etc.

I have worked with people with developmental disabilities and see similarities but because her mom refuses to talk to us, we have no insight.

She has caused us so much stress and we want to kick her out but I am scared that she might be to vulnerable. No one else in the family is willing to take her in, including her mom.  Also none of her friends have their own places yet. What advice to you have for our family?

Summary: Husband's niece moved into our house, has caused lots of problems and we want to kick her out. She has no money, job, or lifeskills. She is extremely vulnerable and we don't think she will succeed on her own.

"My (27F) coworker (29F) is using me as a free therapist and it's completely draining me.


A few months ago I reached out to a coworker when someone close to her passed away. The 'reaching out' was consistent with what you'd say to any distant acquaintance who had just experienced a death - I'm sorry for your loss, thoughts and prayers (lol), etc. I was never close with her to begin with and she had never shown interest in getting close, so my gesture was more out of respect and courtesy than anything else.

&amp;#x200B;

I guess she didn't read it the same way as I did, because for the past several months I have been her free therapist. She will message me countless times throughout the day venting about her family relationships, romantic relationship, depression, anxiety, pets, weight, hair loss - the list goes on - and I'm so sick of it. Initially I was receptive and offered any advice I could, but I think I led her on for far too long because this extends far beyond the mourning period and mourning subject matter. (As an aside, I know grieving takes different amounts of time for different people. But \*\*I\*\* have a set amount of time that I can comfort a grieving person before it extends beyond my ability to support, especially for someone who isn't that close to me.)

&amp;#x200B;

How do I, in the nicest way possible, tell her I cannot do this anymore? She's obviously not in a good place, and on top of that, in the midst of all of this we have developed somewhat of a friendship - she's not insufferable all the time, but the constant depression rants and letting me know what she's doing at all hours of the workday (and sometimes post work hours) is frankly EXTREMELY draining, is taking a toll on my own mental health, and is preventing me from working effectively.

&amp;#x200B;

I've already tried telling her that she should direct her grief toward a professional as I do not have the expertise to help her. That has not changed anything.

  \---   

  \*\*tl;dr\*\*: Coworker bombarding me with her personal troubles and I need advice on how to tell her that I'm not willing to listen all the time anymore."
"My (M20) parents asked me for a small loan of £250 to prevent them from going under. The next day my mother(F50) busy a dress and shoes, and my dad(M54) buys alchohol. I'm upset and worried about my future.


I'm a full-time university student reading medicine at an expensive uni (think oxbridge), doing a 6 year long course. During this years summer break I took up a job to earn some money, primarily because I knew my parents were having financial worries and wanted to be independent for as long as possible. This job paid around 8.50 an hour and I earned around £2000 in total.

This month my father asked me for £250 to prevent credit card payments from 'pushing them into the red' at the end of the month. I agreed- stipulating that as a condition they would not buy any alcohol, stupid purchases (my father has bought £800 canoes that don't work, Wimbledon tickets, stamps for his collection and other wasteful things regularly for many years) or frivolous items until the credit cards had been paid off or there was a guarantee that their financial problems were fully under control, and I wouldn't have to worry about it any more.

The very next day my mother bought a new dress and a pair of shoes, justifying it because she 'needed new clothes for work'. My father, who has struggled with alcohol for almost a decade now, bought beers and wine, with no justification given. I am understandably a bit miffed, and feel a little lied to, as I thought I was helping keep the families financial head above the water, not pay for luxuries.

The kicker is, my parents are both highly paid professionals, my mother receives the highest pay grade for doctors the NHS provides and my father twice the national average. They shouldn't need to be taking money from their kids to pay for these things, surely? I have told them that they need to manage their money better, but as far as I can see, are ignoring all my advice. They insist on sending my 2 younger siblings to private schooling no matter what. They insist on paying for the food and housing of my drug-addicted, violent, abusive and regularly unemployed younger brother. They have a history, especially my father, of making rash impulse-purchases of useless things that cost our family many hundreds of pounds- canoes, summer camps, holidays we cant afford, private tutors, overly expensive and often unwanted family gifts.

They have told me that they'll pay me back in the future and support me through university, and admittedly, they have done so significantly. I'm just worried about the future- My savings will be gone by the end of the year, and I'll need to ask them for support again. What will I do if they have worked themselves into this position again? How do I convince them to manage money better without being accused of 'bullying' or 'being ungrateful'? What options do I have if they can't afford to help me through the last three years of my degree? I'll be starting my clinical years next year and will be unable to work during the summer due to placements.

Christmas and multiple birthdays are approaching and I'm worried.

Thanks.

**Tl;dr**: I give money to parents. Parents spend of trivialities. I'm worried they wont control their spending in the future, and will not support me through the rest of my degree."
"I (24f) have discover through Instagram, that my boyfriend (28m) is married. Not sure how to proceed.


I've lurked this sub as long as I can remember, but hoped I'd never have a reason to post... Annnnd, here I am.

Me and my boyfriend Caleb have been dating for a year as of August. We have what I've always thought was a perfect relationship. He's always been busy, but we worked around it easily.

I don't want this to be long, so I'll cut to the chase.

Basically, I've caught Caleb in many lies and it's sometimes hard for me to believe him, even when he's actually being honest.

For the first time since I've been on instagram, where we mainly talk, I decided to sync my phone contacts to see who I could follow.

I saw an account that I didn't recognize at first, but then realized the username is the same as his on YouTube, which I saw when he sent me a playlist.

It was pretty late, so the next morning I asked about it. He said ""oh yeah, I lost the password to that a long time ago when it got hacked, I don't use it now, that's why I made a new one.""

When we first met, he said he didn't use ig because his account got hacked, so he made one specifically to talk to me.

I let it go, because it seemed legit and went with his original comment about not having a instagram before.

About 3 weeks go by, and it showed up as a suggested user to follow, when I followed someone else... And I immediately noticed now it wasn't a profile pic if a Anime character, it was *him*.

I asked again; nah its hacked. Someone got that from my snapchat obviously."" he woukdnt budge.

It bothered me for *days*. I started looking at it constantly, realizing the bio would change, the amount of followers and following etc.

So, I made a fake account, made it private, posted a bunch of black pics to get the numbers up and used an app to get followers. From the outside, it looked legit. I even made this person obviously into what my bf likes, and I requested.

Got accepted, and he asked to follow me back.. I looked around and was immediately hit with photos of him and a girl... I looked, and the first one was him wishing her a happy birthday and saying he couldn't ask for a better girl to spend his life with.

There was more. And there was her commenting on his selfies and saying lovey stuff...

My heart broke. This *just* happened like 6 hours ago and I don't know what to do. Help


Tl;dr; bf has a wife and I had no idea. What do I do next?"
"Bf [28M] is an extremely picky eater, refuses to cook and just complains about food instead.


Bf and I [24F] have been together for 3.5 yrs, living together for 4 months.



I really should have seen it coming. When we first met and talked about food, he claimed everything tasted the same to him and that he wasnt fussy about anything. He ate to survive..... Yeah right. 



Hes very moody and his view of food changes from day to day. When we were living apart he would complain non stop about his parents cooking. He would do it in front of them with expressions such as ""ewwwwww gross I cant eat that"". Will proceed to grab nutella and bread and consume that instead. 



He praised my cooking though and seemed to enjoy what I cooked. He would ask me to cook for him on special occasions etc.



Now that we live together though. His taste and how he feels about certain foods have changed. The problem is really the protein and vegies. He loves any sweets I make and begs me to make him crepes, pretty sure hed have crepes for breakfast lunch and dinner if I make it. 


But meats ? One day he wants a steak. The next day the idea of meat is disgusting and repulsive to him. It's not always the same meat hes repulsed by either. He'll be fine with chicken but will hate beef. He also has issues with vegetables. Again it's not a single thing he hates consistently but more that it changes from day to day. 


I'll cook a nice vegetable based soup or pasta dish or green beans or brocolli or pumpkin or even patatoe. Nope he will hate it depending on his mood.


Now I'm not a bad cook by a long shot. People love my cooking to the point I'm the designated chef that cooks Christmas dinner for my family and friends 



My bf however is making me feel terrible. I love cooking food and love feeding people I love but this whole thing is making me feel unappreciated. 


I've tried asking him what hed like to eat and he always has no clue. I've tried to get him to cook more but he does not want to cook ever. 



And his idea of food is usually fried potatoes and fried chicken or if hes already home nutella on bread. Or he'll skip dinner/lunch altogether  None of those are healthy/sustainable 


 I've started questioning my relationship especially after I spend a good amount of time cooking something tasty and healthy only to have him make weird faces and noises towards it. I start imagining what it would be like with a partner who appreciates my cooking and heck maybe even cooked for me from time to time. 



Is this something that we can work on ? Or are we doomed. 


I just dont think I can get what his mood is like. I can handle doing all the cooking but I will not do it if I'm constantly made to feel horrible/gross about the things I've slaved to produce.



Tl;dr: bf lied at start claiming he wasnt picky. Hes the worst when it comes to food and now thatwe live together I cant catch up with what he feels like eating "
"My [32/M] husbad never makes me [29/f] orgasm and I'm starting to lose my mind


We've been together since I was 18. I love him, and I always thought that girls never really orgasmed during sex and that the whole being blown away by sex was just kind of Hollywood and not realistic. But now I'm finding out differently (from friends talking about their sex lives), and I'm starting to get frustrated that I never orgasm when we have sex. He also gets jealous and pissed if I use toys (whether with him or not), so I don't really feel like I have an outlet. Yesterday we had sex because I was super horny. He came after like ten minutes (including foreplay), and was like, ""Wow, how could you not have come??"" I know he gets embarassed when I don't (I used to fake it to avoid hurting his feelings, which is my own stupid fault but I honestly didn't think girls came during sex and wasn't sure if girls came at all), but I was just super frustrated and started crying and hid it from him. My husband is SUPER vanilla and incredibly sensitive about the topic. I wish we could be more adventurous. I just feel like I'm doomed to be stuck daydreaming and frustrated for my whole life. I just want some amazing sex, and whenever I try to get into it with my husband, he nixes any ideas that aren't vanilla and/or comes after ten minutes. He also makes me feel horrible if I don't orgasm, or puts pressure on me to cum with five minutes of us having sex, which makes it even harder for me to cum.

And then having sex without any release just frustrates me to no end, I'd rather just avoid sex altogether. Then he gets pissed off that I'm never in the mood. I just feel lonely and angry and doomed. And then pathetic for getting this upset over sex. I dunno.

tldr: My husband never makes me orgasm, won't let me use toys, I don't know what to do"
"I’m [28m] American, recently relocated to the UK. My new Londoner GF [25f] is on a kick to get me to be more.....uh, British, I guess, and it weirds me out a little bit. Is this a normal thing?


Heyo!

This is such a weird issue, and I *think* she is coming from a good place, I’m just kinda weirded out by it.

As mentioned, I relocated from the US to London about five months ago. And I really, really love it here! I initially only planned to be here for a year or two, but I’m considering staying permanently-ish if I can work it out with the government.

But that’s beside the point. I met a very pretty London girl a couple months after I moved here, and we hit it off very well. Hannah is a really great girl and has helped me fit in in a number of ways.

We’ve been dating three months. Maybe a month ago she started trying to help me assimilate, I guess. At first it was pretty welcome. Stuff like helping me remember the subtle and not-so-subtle differences between US-English and British-English. It was *slightly* annoying when she would jump in and correct me for using an American slang term in place of something more British-y, but I figured she was just trying to help, so I didn’t say anything.

But it seems like she’s kicked it up a notch these last couple weeks and its getting on my nerves a bit. There was a day last week she came over to my apartment (sorry, *flat*) and looked at my clothes (I was wearing some lose jeans and a t-shirt from some dive bar in Texas) and made the comment “I need to take you clothes shopping.” I asked her what was wrong with what I was wearing and she gave me an answer like “Nothing, you look okay, just.....you dress so *American*.” I told her that kinda makes sense, since, ya know, I’m American, and really I don’t think I look all that much different from most other people I see on the street. 

She responded that she thinks I dress okay, but I’m in the UK now, and she wants to go get some more UK-style clothes. I still don’t think there is much of a difference in fashion, but I let it go. 

Over the last couple weeks she has kind of subtling been making fun of my American accent, too. She claims she likes it, but she has been kinda making fun of what I say by repeating it with an over-emphasized Texas-accent (I don’t even have a Texas accent, for the record), and then trying to get me to repeat in a non-rhotic fake Britsh accent.

It was cute at first I guess, but shes been doing it more and more lately and I have to keep reminding her that I don’t think anyone is going to be mistaking me for a Brit any time soon, so I don’t really see a point in trying to pretend.

And then there are just a bunch of little comments that I probably wouldn’t mind if not for the above-mentioned stuff. Like, a couple days ago we were catching a ride from a friend of hers and she made the comment “You should love riding with him, he drives one of those big cars Americans like.” (It was a Chrysler 300, again, for the record). 

I don’t know, it’s like she simultaneously doesn’t want me to forget I’m not from here, but still wants me to pretend like I am. When I point this out she says she’s just trying to help me fit in, and I tell her that honestly she is literally the only one who even seems to care.

She’s promised to tone it down a little bit, but hasn’t, really. I can appreciate that she is doing what she feels is helpful, but it’s kind of exhausting.

Outside of this issue, she’s great. I’m quite happy with her. I just need her to tone down on the cultural stuff that I don’t think is as big a deal as she seems to think it is. Help?

**TL;DR** American in London (not a werewolf, sadly). My British girlfriend has been on a crusade these last couple weeks to get me to be more “British” and it feels a little weird to me. Help?

"My (23f) mother (51f) is obese and seems to have given up on herself. I am worried and my dad (56m) is exhausted


My mom has always been overweight and I've always been worried. But it's getting worse. It's obvious that she has given up on herself. When she comes home from work, she immediately lies down on the sofa because she's so exhausted, and watches TV the entire day. 
I think she does even less around the house than before and it all gets left for my father. He seems to be exhausted because he has a very stressful job and also does the majority of cleaning around the house because my mother is to exhausted from carrying all her own weight around all day long. I think they love each other, but I also think my father just tries to cope with his frustration about my mom by not thinking about it. But he told me he would like to do more for himself, but he can't as long as he's with my mom. I don't think he wants to leave her, but he sort of thinks about what it would be like if she weren't there.

The other thing is that I'm just very worried about my mom because this level of obesity is just not healthy. She has gradually gained more weight over the years and has gradually given up more and more. She told me she thinks it's too late for her to change, and I tried to tell her it's not and tried to tell her what she could do to be healthier, but every time I can reach her, she closes down again and changes the topic. We don't have many heart to hearts anymore as I don't live at home and I kind of get this rage every time we talk because I feel resentment for her not taking care of herself.
Because I have This kind of selfish thought that I want to have her around for as long as possible and I feel like she doesn't care about that and therefore doesn't care about her family enough to live. I know that's not true and I can understand her as I know how hard it is even for me to maintain my health, so it must be much harder for her. But I still get so sad every time I allow myself to think about it.

I don't know what to do, how to help her become healthy. Every time I try, she pushes me away and changes the topic, but I can clearly see the pain in her eyes because she doesn't want to be this way, but she can't change it. How do I help her?

Every time I hear something about how obesity affects your help, I think about my mother and I get scared of losing her before she can see me grow up and play with her potential grandchildren some day. 
I'm also scared of my father eventually leaving her over this because even though they love each other, I think he is not entirely happy and would also wish for her to become a more active, healthy person. Does anyone know how I can approach helping her seek professional help or help her lose weight and become healthier? She is such a wonderful person actually and I want her to regain her self-worth.

Tl;Dr My mother is morbidly obese and I love her, so I want her to be happy and healthy, but she rejects every attempt to help her. Also, my father might be very frustrated about it. Help?"
"I [26/F] feel like I can’t decompress from work when my boss [32/F] requires we have a group text with my coworkers and texts me at night; I don’t know how to set boundaries with her.


I work in a social work field and at the end of the night when done with our day we’re required to send a text to our boss Denise so she knows we’re safe. At first this was no problem, but Denise started noticing that in our team of 6, some people would forget to text her and therefore she decided a group text may be a more efficient way of making sure people remembered to send her a message to let her know they were safe. 

The thing is; people don’t have consistent times in which they’re done with work. Some people get off at 2pm some days and others get off at 8pm. It’s just how our job goes - therefore, at 8pm, I’m often receiving an influx of texts from coworkers saying they’re done with work - and when I’ve finished my day, that’s really frustrating to receive several messages at night when I want to relax. 

The second thing is, my boss is GREAT and I think she’s a wonderful person and appreciate her invaluable knowledge and kindness - but sometimes at night she’ll send a text to see how I’m doing or how my day was. Although I appreciate her checking in at times after a visit I don’t always want to chat. For example, Monday I was sick and I’m also pregnant so I called in. Tuesday I went in, let her know how I was doing and then went home at 3. At 7 I received a text from her asking how I was doing, but I had fallen asleep for the night and didn’t hear the message. At 10:45PM she sent another text asking if I was OK because she hadn’t heard from me. I sent a message back saying I was sleeping and she replied “OK just checking you’re OK!” 

I’m just a bit overwhelmed with how much work communicates. Even on weekends at times, and it’s slightly exhausting sometimes. I don’t know if I’m blowing this out of proportion and how to set the boundaries needed to maintain a healthy work-life balance? 

TLDR: I feel like I communicate with work too much after I’m clocked out. "
"Is my boyfriend (24/m) insane?


My boyfriend has been open about his porn watching habits and I don’t mind. I mean let’s be realistic here. 

But today he was like hey I wanna buy a VR headset to watch porn. And I was like uhh okay if that’s what you want. And then he was like can I wear them while having sex with you? I was a bit taken aback but I answered sarcastically like ‘wow sure that’ll be so romantic having sex with someone wearing a vr headset watching porn’ and the sarcasm just flew over his head. He’s like yeah!! You can wear them too! And i’m just.. at loss for words..

I mean it already makes me feel pretty bad knowing that he wants to fantasize about a porn star instead while doing it with me (most people probably fantasizes about others at one point during sex but i don’t want to know about that shit and i definitely don’t want to know when it’s happening) but he has to add a freaking vr headset into it. So i imagine i’ll sort of be like his sex doll just staring at his ugly vr headset waiting for the whole thing to be finished while he’s having fun with his fantasies. And he doesn’t even have the EQ and the common sense to realise how messed up that is.
He’s always been a bit callous and socially clueless and I’ve been trying to understand but I think i’m running out of patience.

Do you think it’s reasonable for me to be mad about this?

Tl;dr it boggles the mind how dumb and insensitive he is. He’s like an alien who doesn’t understand human interactions.

"My [17f] boyfriend [17m] wants a ""free pass"" while he is away on a school trip. What should I do?


It's gonna be a 4 week sort of exchange student program. He will go to another state on a scholarship to study French.

He wants us to basically be broken up during those weeks so he can be with anyone he wants to over there and then when he comes we will be together again as if nothing happened. I told him if he really cared about us he would be able to control himself, then he said I couldn't expect him to not take the chances he will have when he gets there.

No matter what I say or what he says he can still do whatever he wants once he's there so it's like what is the point of even talking right?

What should I do? I already told him I don't want to give him a free pass but he can do whatever he wants anyway. I feel awful and don't know what to do. What should I do?

**tl;dr:** Boyfriend wants a free pass during a 4 week school trip. I told him no. What should I do next?"
"Me [24 M] and my Mother [55 F] and Brother [29 M], are in an argument cause they didn't tell me my sister died.


Hi all, so my family are.... strange.

Little history, mother and father are divorced, I am the only one that talks to both sides. My sister is from dad's previous marriage so my mum doesn't care about her.

So my sister died 4 day's ago, and the only person to contact me was my dad, my Brother was with my sister at the time of her death so I know that my mum and him would know about it, but they had no idea that I knew.

Skip to today where I have been in a shouting match with both of them cause I feel hurt that they didn't bother to tell me. There reason is that they did not know I talked to her so they felt I didn't care so there was no point in telling me. A quot from my brother talking about our mum, ""it's not her fault that no one told you"", to me this feels very stupid as a statement as it would have been very easy for either of them to tell me.

In any case they have not said sorry and have been blaming me, saying that I should say sorry for upsetting them, I don't know how to feel about this, while I have a strong guilt I also feel that I am justified in feeling hurt and that they should care about the fact I am hurt rather then being angry at me.

Should I cut contact with them? Say sorry? I just don't know what to do and some outside objective thought's on weather I am being stupid or not would be nice.

Here is a link to the conversations I have had with them so that there is even more clarity and objectivity.


TL:DR My mum and brother seem to be strong arming me into saying sorry for feeling hurt that they didn't tell me about my sisters death."
"My boyfriend [29M] intentionally tries to make me [26F] upset for his own amusement.


We've been together just over four years now. About two years ago he started to act differently. He likes saying horrible things to me such as racist/homophobic comments. He'll belittle me or say ""sorry I wasn't listening"" whenever I try to talk to him about something serious. He'll often grab me inappropriately after I ask him not to. He also likes making scenes in public and act like a toddler. 

He only does these things once or twice a day, and otherwise is perfectly sweet. Yesterday he's admitted that he likes to go out of his way to do things that annoy me because he thinks it is cute when I am mad or crying. I tried telling him that that isn't okay, but he thinks that because he likes it/finds it funny, it isn't a big deal. How do I help him understand how these things aren't okay?

TL;DR: Boyfriend regularly likes to act like a jerk (but only sometimes) because he likes making me upset."
"Fiancée [26F] wondering if she’s settling for me [29M] and if there are better options now that she’s in grad school. What do I do?


Sorry for any spelling errors, I’m on mobile right now. 

Last week I got a message from one of my fiancées good friends in her home state. Fiancée and I have been together 5 years, engaged for 4 months. She’s currently in New York for business school. 

Anyways her friend send me a bunch of screenshots of their text message from a few weeks ago. The friend just said something like “I’m really not looking to get involved in anything but you seem like a nice guy so I thought you’d want to see this. I know I would.” 

She then sent me a bunch of fb messages between them. It started with my fiancée talking about what school was like then her friend asks what the other students are like. Fiancée then says that some of her guys in her class are really cute and they talk about this for a while. Nothing serious. 

Then the friend asks her if she’s been planning for our wedding next spring and fiancée is kind of unresponsive to which the friend asks her what’s wrong. The floodgates open with my fiancée confessing that she’s been feeling really guilty for thinking that there are a lot of really great available guys around and if she’s settling with me. There’s a lot of back and forth here but a key part was when she said something about what her 14 year old self would think if she saw her and me together. She mentioned some guy in one of her classes being her classic “type” and how she feels weird that she always considered those guys out of her league. She says something like that guy and her have been flirting but nothing serious. But she says she feels like maybe she’s had low self esteem for a long time which held her back in college and now that she’s in school again she’s really surprised at all the positive attention she’s getting from guys she once considered to be out of reach. 

The friend says something like, you should tell your fiancé this and my fiancée just changed the subject. 

I’m so hurt, to put it simply. I confronted my fiancée about this a few days ago and she didn’t deny it. She just cried and said she can’t imagine losing me. She says she’s just confused and she admits it was wrong to flirt with those guys but it just felt good in the moment. She said everyone wonders and in the long run it’s not a big deal. 

I don’t know what to do? I’m still so hurt and every day at work I feel like throwing up. I can’t stop thinking about what she said and now that we’re long distance it makes it even harder. What should I do? 

TLDR: fiancée confessed to her friend that she’s been wondering if she’s settling for me because of the guys she’s meeting now that she’s at grad school. She feels like guys that are “more her type” are now showing her interest. She, however, tells me she can’t lose me. What do I do? How do I deal with these feelings of hurt? "
"I [M25] was adopted by a white family and I’m having an identity crisis


  

Hey all

I’m a 25 year old man. I’m black, and my adopted family is white. I was adopted when I was 9 years old. I’m from the UK. My mother is Swedish and my father Norwegian but I was raised in England. However, I live and work in the United States. 

My roots lie in Africa – I’m originally from the Ivory Coast. My parents adopted me when I was little as they used to work for a child’s rights NGO in the Ivory Coast. My birth parents abandoned me when I was 3 and I lived in an orphanage. I ran away when I was 8 because the conditions in that place were awful. 

I stayed on the streets with a group of orphaned kids for several months. It was an absolutely awful experience that is filled with a ton of trauma I won’t go into. And then my parents found me, fell in love with me and adopted me. There are three children in my family – I have two older sisters who are my parents’ biological children. We’ve always had a great relationship. My eldest sister named her first born son after me.

I grew up in a small town in England. It was overwhelmingly white. In both primary and secondary school, I was the only black kid present. Looking back with the self-consciousness of an adult, it was a strange situation. But as a kid it didn’t seem so strange.

I mean in the beginning it was strange, but I always find children to be highly adaptable and I certainly adapted. It became so normal that I stopped seeing race – I stopped seeing the fact I was black, and they white. I just saw people. There were a couple of racist incidents growing up but for the most part, I had a very positive experience growing up. It’s only now I realise how sheltered and fortunate I was.

Leaving home at 18 and doing my BA and MA degrees made me realise the sheltered nature of my childhood (once I was adopted and came to England). Growing up, since I was the only black kid in the area, all my friends were white. During my undergrad degree, I would often visit childhood friends who were studying on different campuses. It would be a little secondary school reunion, with a bunch of us childhood friends converging onone location – from all over England - to party and have a good time. I would be the only black person in this group of childhood friends, and on several occasions I got glares and racially derogatory comments from a few black students. Shit along the lines of being a “sellout.” This really hurt. It still does.

All throughout my undergrad, I dealt with comments and preconceived notions on the lines of “you act white” from both white and black students. Initially, I just laughed those comments off but hearing them all the time can wear you down. It was during this time I began being self-conscious about race and my background, and realising that the innocent world I lived in as a child wasn’t reality. And that reality is much crueller and much more judgemental.

As an adult, I’ve been dealing with this conflict since I was 18. I moved to the US two years ago for work and I also experience it here. My partner is white, and from Sweden. 

I’ve known her since I was 13 – we would visit Scandinavia as a family frequently during the summer months. She lived across the street from my maternal grandparents and we became friends. We started dating when we were both 21. I visited Sweden to see my maternal grandparents after doing my BA and I met my partner.  Seeing her as a grown, beautiful woman blew my mind. We hit it off and started dating. 

We’ve had external, racially-fuelled issues and this has exacerbated my emotional turmoil. I believe honesty is key in every relationship and I’ve told my partner about what I’ve been going through. She has been mightily supportive and I love her to death cause of it. 

Prior me opening up to her, we had been talking about having children but we have put that off until I get better. I’ve been seeing a therapist, taking anti-depressants and even started doing things such as meditation. Dealing with such emotional turmoil has also brought back unsavoury memories prior my adoption and it has heightened my anxiety. Last week at work, my co-worker in the office next to mine was playing a certain pop track from the 80s. I heard it frequently when I was a kid and the song really engaged the nostalgic part of my mind. I had to rush to the bathroom and lock myself in a cubicle as I just started crying.

I’ve always been incredibly close to my parents and my sisters. But I haven’t told them anything about what I’m feeling. My dad is currently doing chemo for bowel cancer. It’s a really difficult time for all of us and I don’t wanna add to the stress. 

However, my mother knows me well – she can read me like a book. Recently, when we’ve been video-chatting, she has told me she feels like something is wrong is me. I hate lying, but I’ve lied to her and told her that I’m doing absolutely great, when I’m not.

&amp;#x200B;

\*\*tl;dr\*\*

My therapist has told me that I'm having an identity crisis. And that the trauma from my childhood (pre-adoption) has merged itself to my current trials. She says the child in me is conflicted about who he really is, hence what I'm going through. My girlfriend has suggested that I one day take a trip back to the Ivory Coast (we did so a couple of times with my family - I never liked going back) because after everything I've told her, she feels like I don't have closure. My mind is a whirlwind of thoughts and emotions right now, and I'd appreciate any thoughts on what I can do to make things better not just for myself, but also my partner. Because my emotional state is also affecting her right now, even though she says I shouldn't worry about it at all and even though she has been absolutely supportive."
"I [16M] asked a girl [17F] with a development disability to a school dance to be nice and now she thinks we're dating. How can I let her down without hurting her feelings?


Basically there's a girl in a couple of my classes who is kind of slow at learning and has the mentality of a child. She's not really ""bullied"" exactly as in no one would make fun of her but people don't really hang out with her either. We had a school dance last week and I noticed she was sad and asked her why and she said she didn't want to go alone. I asked her to go with me because I didn't want her to feel bad and I thought it would be a nice thing to do for her. She ended up having a really nice time and I had a pretty good time as well. Just to be clear she is a sweet person but I'm not at all attracted to her and I would honestly feel like a creep dating someone who is basically a child in a teenager's body. I would be fine being her friend though and she is very nice. 

&amp;#x200B;

Anyway it turns out that now she thinks that we are a couple. Maybe I wasn't clear enough about asking her as a friend and that is totally my fault but now she's going around telling people that I'm her boyfriend. It makes me feel weird and I also don't want her to get the wrong idea. I need to tell her in a clear way that we are not dating but she is very sensitive and gets hurt very easily. I don't want to come off like I'm being rude or hurtful but I also don't want to beat around the bush and confuse her even more. She is a genuinely nice person and I think she honestly believes that we are dating. How can I approach this as nicely as possible? 

&amp;#x200B;

tl;dr I accidentally made a in my class with a disability think I'm her boyfriend and I want to break it to her as nicely as possible that I'm not"
"[UPDATE] Guy (29M) I'm (23F) seeing super into me in person but never text?


Hi,

I posted a while ago asking for opinion on whether it is normal to not hear from a guy i'm seeing much via texts. Although my post didnt get a lot of attention, everyone who answered was tremendously helpful so i feel like I own you guys an update.

&amp;#x200B;

Link to old post: [https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/9d8ngf/guy\_29m\_im\_23f\_seeing\_super\_into\_me\_in\_person\_but/](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/9d8ngf/guy_29m_im_23f_seeing_super_into_me_in_person_but/)

 

TLDR of last post: guy i'm seeing is only affectionate in person and never talk or flirt via texts which makes me think he only wants me for physical stuff. We see each other twice a week. 

&amp;#x200B;

Okay so here s the update. On the day of my last post we saw each other that night. Again, he was super affectionate and being very attentive, loving in person. He told me I was one of the most beautiful thing I has ever seen and he was so attracted to me in every way. We also almost slept together but I asked him if he likes me as a person and if he was seeing anyone else because I wasn't. And that while i am not looking for any grand commitment from his side, I would prefer to wait until we know each other better and not seeing anyone else to have sex. \[lol please don't downvote me for being a prude I just don't want to know that the man i'm sleeping with also sleep with other people\]. Anyway he agreed to wait and we had a lovely night just cuddling and making out. 

&amp;#x200B;

HOWEVER, since the, it has been radio silent. We texted a bit after that day because I left one thing at his house but nothing else afterward. I texted him again after a week of not hearing from him asking about if he had a busy week and ... cricket. He has been watching my instagram story but not reply to my text. I am a little disappointed but also know that it's time to move on. I wish he could have just told me that it would not have worked instead of just ghosted. Especially since I really like him and he \[appeared to\] like me too.

&amp;#x200B;

I really should have listened to my gut instinct that his barebone communication via texts was a red flag that no amount of great in-person behavior could have made up for. Guess I hope I remember this lesson and move on from this. I definitely think ghosting is more damaging than just straight up rejection but other people may feel differently on this. 

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR: He ghosted. I accepted the fact but still kinda bummed out because I liked him and he made me feel so special when we were together. Should have listened to my gut instinct on this.

"Boyfriend’s (28m) attention seeking coworker (19f) is trying to undermine our relationship (27f)


So I’m looking for advice, even if that advice is “ignore her and  live your best life”. 

My boyfriend and I have been together for a year and honestly it’s the healthiest relationship I’ve ever been in. We just moved in together and everything was going great. Enter Sapphire, his attention seeking compulsive liar of a coworker.

She lies about everything - her “bulimia”, her pregnancy (she told one person she had a one night stand three months ago, she told someone else it was a few weeks ago, she told some people it’s twins and others that it’s one boy she’s going to name after my boyfriend). She says she’s a lesbian but every time I see her she tells me about a new guy she’s been banging. Last time I saw her she was yelling about four guys she’d slept with in 24 hours. The girl is a mess and everyone in the workplace takes whatever she says with a bucket of salt.

Anyway, she started clinging to my boyfriend, Sam. Texting him constantly, calling him after work with her made up dramas. Making up some sort of close friendship and telling everyone she sees him as a father or brother figure. I got pretty wary because I could see this all going south pretty quickly so I asked Sam to set up some firm boundaries with her. It’s not appropriate for a manager to have that kind of relationship with one of their workers. Sam agreed and he stopped talking to Sapphire about anything that wasn’t work related.

Fast forward to last weekend, Sam’s birthday. We went out for some drinks and Sapphire was there. She claims to have alcohol dependency issues and she kept harping on at Sam to keep an eye on her with her drinking. Sam told her multiple times he doesn’t want to have to be responsible for her, ESPECIALLY on his birthday. She has a couple of drinks on the sly. She corners me at one point and slurs for a solid five minutes telling me how much she admires me for having my shit together etc. we move on to a different bar and Sam and I start playing a game of pool. Sapphire follows Sam around the table constantly asking him if he’s mad at her for drinking and why is he mad and can he not be so mad because it’s making her anxious. Sam is ignoring her and it’s really annoying me so I snapped and told her to fuck off because we’re in the middle of a game.

Now she’s pissed off at me and is going around telling anyone who will listen that I’m threatened by her and I’m using her as a scapegoat for my wider issues with my relationship. I feel like anything I do here is going to feed into her delusion - does anyone have any experience with this sort of thing? Should I confront her and tell her to back off? Sam has stopped talking to her about anything that isn’t directly related to work while they’re at work together. Anything else I can do?

TL;DR: Attention seeking compulsive liar is getting all amongst my relationship like we’re back in high school and it’s getting pretty annoying but I don’t know how to handle this level of drama without making it worse."
"My brother-in-laws girlfriend [25F] who I [29F] dislike keeps inviting herself around my house now I have a baby [9wksF]


So I'm really keen to get some honest feedback from people here - it's quite possible I'm being a bit precious about this and may benefit from being told to pull my head in!

&amp;#x200B;

So my husband \[29M\] and I have been together for nearly 10 years and have recently had our first child, a beautiful daughter who is 9 weeks old on Monday. We are chuffed with her! She is generally a really settled, healthy baby and is cute as a button to boot - we are very lucky. My husband works full time and is now back at work, while I am at home full time with our daughter. My husband has an older brother \[33M\] who has been dating his girlfriend Ally \[25F\] for nearly 2 years. Prior to me being pregnant, we generally saw them every month or so, always at broader family get togethers e.g. with my husbands other brother and dad, or extended family dos. We never socialised with them on our own, and certainly Ally and I had never spent any time together away from the boys. 

&amp;#x200B;

Of relevance here is that my feelings towards Ally currently range from mild irritation to outright dislike, depending on the day. When she came on the scene I really, REALLY wanted to like her. I had been the only girl at the vast majority of my husband's family do's for the preceding 8 years and so was keen to have another woman there to chat to - and to talk about something other than cars and footy with! My first impression of her was that she was young and immature but sweet enough - I didn't have any particular problem with her. However, over the course of the time I've known her I have found her increasingly difficult to like. We live in Australia where about 12 months ago we had a public plebiscite regarding whether same sex couples should be allowed to marry - as you might imagine, this generated a huge amount of public debate, with many people taking to social media to express their opinions. I am a staunch Yes voter. Ally and my brother-in-law are staunch No voters. In the lead up to the vote, Ally began repeatedly sharing articles from various websites advocating for people to vote no. These articles ranged from slightly misinformed at best to outright lies and blatant bigotry at worst, including allegations that for same sex couples to raise children was tantamount to child abuse, and that young people who identified as LGBTQI were unnatural and needed therapy. Of particular concern to me was that our 15 year old female cousin (who at the time had Ally on Facebook) was in the process of coming out as bi (something both Ally and my brother-in-law were and are unaware of), and so was reading Ally's posts and comments on this topic and discussing her distress about them with her mum, who I was in contact with. 

&amp;#x200B;

I am a Clinical Psychologist who works with young people, so the comments regarding same sex parenting and the vulnerability of our cousin to the hate that was being spewed (both by Ally and a range of others) prompted me to share a literature review, written by the Australian Psychological Society, reviewing the research around same sex parenting - which of course shows same sex couples to be just as fit to parent as anyone else. I accompanied this with an admittedly strongly worded but calm and reasoned post encouraging those who might hold the view that gay parents were abusive to acquaint themselves with the research on the topic before using the idea as a basis to vote no. Several hours later, Ally posted a public status in which she referenced my post and described me as arrogant, conceited and prideful, and stated that she now understood why pride was one of the seven deadly sins. Though I was not named, it was evident to all of our family who she was referring to, and many of our extended family reached out to me afterwards to touch base - including the cousin I was protecting. I chose to make no comment or reference to her post either online or face to face, preferring instead to avoid a public catfight and not add any more tension to the situation - to this day, it has never been mentioned by either of us. But from this situation, it was abundantly clear that Ally had no time for me - and, if I'm honest, that I had no time for her. 

&amp;#x200B;

So while we have both been friendly and polite from then on, it was clear we were never going to be bosom buddies. And then I got pregnant. Almost immediately, Ally's approach to me changed. Throughout my pregnancy she took every opportunity to ask me questions - friendly and appropriate at first. But by the time I was in the third trimester, I was finding her intrusive. In the last few weeks of my pregnancy she began posting statuses almost daily on her Facebook referencing my pregnancy and her impatience for my baby to arrive. She asked me, repeatedly, what my plans were for the birth and when I told her that we would not be telling anyone when I was in labour, she began messaging my husband and my mother (!!) to ask for details instead. In the final week of my pregnancy, my husband or my mum heard from her almost every day, asking if I was in labour. When we had the baby and she and my brother-in-law came to visit, she described my newborn daughter as 'her new toy'. My mother in law was visiting from interstate during the first week - and so everytime she came around, Ally came too. They stayed for hours each visit, despite me being (at the time) incredibly unwell with a fractured tailbone and infection that had rendered me barely able to sit down, with fever so high I was literally shaking like a leaf. If she didn't get to hold the baby on a particular visit, she was visibly sulky and disappointed. The moment that the baby was down for a nap and it was obvious no more cuddles were available, she played with her phone until she left. On one occasion, when we declined for her to visit because I needed to go for tests to try and find the source of the infection, she merely responded with a thumbs up emoji - and only thought to ask more details about what was happening and if I was actually OK several hours later. 

&amp;#x200B;

Since my husband returned to work, she has taken to inviting herself around to my house 'for coffee' multiple times per week. She has asked to come over 3 times in the last 7 days - though I'm saying no way more than I'm saying yes, giving various excuses. On occasions where I have mentioned to her that my daughter may not be up for being held e.g. the day after she had her first lot of vaccinations and was very fussy and unhappy, Ally's interest in coming around mysteriously vanishes. I feel strongly that she has no interest in a relationship with me, and that I am merely a checkpoint she has to go through to get access to my daughter. As my husband and I have discussed on several occasions, we both have the impression that when she visits, she is 'playing dress ups' - holding our daughter, taking photos of her, and testing out what she thinks it would feel like to be a mum. Ally has made no secret of the fact that she is very 'clucky' and wants a baby, and we both sense the vibe from her somewhere between jealousy and entitlement when she is around our daughter. It is blatantly obvious to me that her visits have precious little to do with supporting us, or having a relationship with us or even having a relationship with our daughter - it feels like they serve her needs to hold a baby and fantasise about having one, and when the visits don't serve her needs, she isn't interested. 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm torn between thinking I need to letting her know more clearly that she is being intrusive (evidently being subtle and just making excuses as to why she can't come around isn't doing the trick), and just putting my big girl pants on and tolerating it for the sake of keeping the peace with the family. I'd really appreciate some outside perspectives!

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR: Since having my daughter, my brother-in-law's girlfriend, who I dislike and who I believe dislikes me, has taken to inviting herself around my house multiple times a week so she can hold and take photos of my daughter. She was similarly pushy during my pregnancy. I resent the intrusion, the needing to use my limited time and energy playing nice with someone who evidently has no interest in a relationship with me, and the icky feeling that she is using my daughter to play out her fantasies of having her own child. But I might just being a grump. Which is it? "
"Lazy BF [28/M] won’t make agreed upon changes and I [28/F] am at the end of my rope. Am I wrong for wanting to end this? (6 years together)


  

I love my BF but his laziness is ruining our relationship. Rick and I met at a party and quickly hit it off. He was the opposite of every guy I knew then. He was interested in poetry and activism, he liked to read old books and have deep philosophical conversations about random subjects. It was such a nice break from talking about STEM-related projects and tests, just to have someone to talk to about anything. Rick helped me get into Dental school – he took the burden off of me and was there for me, supported me and would even help me study for tests. But, as time has worn on, Rick has become less willing to do anything. He hasn’t held a job in 3 years – he occasionally finds temporary work, but it’s often poorly paid and he’s terrible with money. It means I am paying for 100% of our expenses and even his spending money. He could go to a coffee shop and sit there for hours drinking a tea and never getting a single application out. He thinks it’s not a big deal, I’m a dentist and there’s more than enough to go around (which isn't the case). 

At home, he doesn’t clean up after himself. He doesn’t take initiative to clean clothes, make a dinner, prepare himself fthe next day. He will sit and watch TV or play video games for 8 hours. The same mess that he made in the morning is still there when I get home. We’ve fought about this for years and he always agrees to take initiative, and he will, for a day or two, and then it drops. When I keep on him, he bristles and says I’m smothering him. 

I love Rick, but I’m getting fed up. I don’t see this as an equitable situation, I have considerable debt and me having to pay for everything – including my own presents for my birthday is wearing me out. I made my own birthday cake and brought it to a party. He forgot it was my birthday and bought a card on the way there. I cried in the bathroom. He said he would get me something but never did. He used my credit card to buy something he would like and thought ""we could share."" 

Last weekend things came to a critical point. 

My best friend and I were roommates as undergrads. She went off to medical school and I went to dental school. We come from a friend group that were high achievers. My best friend, Kate, is working towards becoming a primary care physician. Our friend group has two people who went to medical school, I went to dental school and a number of our friends earned PhDs in STEM-related fields. Despite being very academically inclined I think we’re an accepting bunch. 

Kate and I are both in relationships with guys who aren’t in STEM or medical/dental fields. Although Kate is my best friend, I don’t see her all that often. We’ve been really busy but text and chat all the time. We had a “reunion” and I was so excited to be there. I told her about how Rick has changed and she assured me that her fiancé Ben (who isn’t in science and doesn’t care to hear about it) will be there and will talk to him. I was leery of bringing Rick, he often only talks if it’s a subject he wants to speak about – he will sit silently and refuse to make conversation, so I thought that Ben being there would help. It was a nightmare. Ben is a super high achiever in his own right; he’s a financial analyst type person with graduate degrees in statistics and one in business. I was blown away by their relationship. He helps Kate with her loans and for her birthday he took a small side gig and paid off one of her loans. I was so charmed by Ben. He was funny and earnest and when it came right down to it, was a genuinely nice guy. He jokingly mocked us about being “superior” to other people because we’re doctors and made us all laugh the whole night. He picked up the tab and thanked us all for a lovely evening – we all commented about how nice he is. Rick sat silently at the table and didn’t engage anyone. He didn’t want to talk unless it was about him or his interests. People thought he was angry. He wasn’t. He just stopped having any interest in conversations when it doesn’t suit him. He never thanked Ben for buying his slew of drinks or even try to make small talk. He just kept looking at his phone. I was mortified and apologized for him. It made me remember how much I miss my friends and want to make the effort to see them more. But, I also feel like our relationship is over. I told Rick how I felt and about how much he contributes around the house and his suggestion was hiring a maid service and taking a small vacation to get reconnected. He has no problems spending money I don’t have. I just feel like this is over. Instead of fighting that night, I just went to sleep.

I feel tremendously guilty, but I also feel like we’re at the end of the road. Do I break up with him? I’m worried that I’m miscommunicating how I feel and we’ve been together for 6 years. It’s been a long time. Am I making a mistake? 

&amp;#x200B;

tl;dr BF has become lazy, won't get a job, and spends his days wasting time. He has no goals or ambition and when he agrees to change things (like doing even a single chore) he won't follow through. Am I wrong for finally wanting to end this? Am I rushing this break up?"
"How do I [35F] deal with this request from my ex-MIL?[6?F]


This is probably a pretty boring post for this sub, but I’m genuinely looking for advice so I figured I’d ask anyway. Also this may sound like I’m asking for financial or legal advice, but I’m honestly not. 

Quick backstory: I’m recently divorced. My ex (40M) is not a bad guy, but not very responsible or motivated. I got sick of being his breadwinner/maid/accountant/chef/surrogate mother and sitting at home alone most nights while he was out smoking weed with his buddies. So we broke up. That’s the short version. 

My relationship with my ex-in laws wasn’t terrible. I think while we were married they were relieved that I was around to be the grown up and take care of their son. So much so that they sent me (rather than him) all of their personal documents, wills, insurance info, pension statements, etc since they knew I’d look after it, while my ex would probably lose it. 

Which is why, when I had a kid, when we set up a registered education fund for our daughter it went under my name as the subscriber/manager. Because we all knew *I* would be the one to keep an eye on it, invest the funds, that sort of thing. My ex-ILs very generously contributed money to it every month as a gift, and so did I. So after a few years there’s now a fair chunk of change in there, about 3/4 of which I’ve locked into GICs. My ex has never contributed anything to it. 

Now that my ex and I have broken up, my ex-MIL emailed me a few weeks ago asking me to take my name off the account and sign it over to my ex. Initially I thought that was ok and said I’d look into it...until I thought about it and realized a) she wanted me to take my name off money *I* had also contributed to my kid’s education and b) my ex wouldn’t do a damn thing to invest that money and help it grow, he would just let it sit there. 

So I sat on my hands for a few weeks until I got a follow up email from MIL saying “Have you done this yet???” I responded no, because I had some questions and concerns and laid them out very succinctly and politely, because I’m trying to keep the waters calm. She responded that she had no idea I “hated” her so much (oh lord, I just said I had some questions....) but maybe the best course would be to have BOTH myself and my ex listed as subscribers on the account. Ok fine, whatever keeps the peace. 

Now here’s where I’m at and would like some advice: I responded to MIL that I would be fine with being the co-manager / subscriber to the account. HOWEVER I said something along the lines of “Have (Ex) reach out to me when he’s figured out the procedure with the bank and when / where the appointment is and I’ll be there.” 

Because here’s the thing; I know that she expects me to be the one to call the bank, to figure out how to get this done, to make an appointment with the bank (while coordinating a time with my ex) and taking time out of my day to go into the bank.....and quite frankly while I know it sounds petty, I’m annoyed that YET again this family is telling me to jump and expecting me to say “how high and can I grab anyone a drink while I’m up?” She wants me to do her a favour (because legally I know I’m on solid ground if I straight out refused) and bend over backwards to accommodate it as well? I swore I was done being a servant to my ex, and now here I am being asked to run errands AGAIN because my ex can’t rouse himself to make a phone call?

I *know* that they’ve been very generous to help contribute to my daughter’s education and I’m grateful for that, but I also have a problem with having these demands put on me because their own son won’t lift a finger. I know I’m going to get another email saying “when will this get done?” because there’s no way my ex will do anything to help tie this off (seriously, the man hadn’t done his taxes in 4 years when we’d met, there’s no way he’s following up on this of his own volition). 

What do I do here? Do I tell her I’m waiting for my ex to get his shit together and call me? Do I just swallow my pride and do it all myself? Do I email the correspondence to my ex and tell him to figure it out? 

Tldr; Ex’s Mom is asking me to sign over daughters education savings (they partially contributed to) to my ex who contributed nothing. "
"My ex-wife [F35] and friend is seriously dating a registered sex offender [M40s]. I [M36] don’t want our son [M6] to live in a house that appears on a map of registered offenders.


**TL;DR: My ex-wife–whom I’m friends with–has been dating a guy for over 2 years.  He was charged, tried and convicted of raping his ex-wife.  Everyone involved believes this is a false claim.  I mostly believe he is falsely accused.  They’re talking about getting married, which would mean my ex-wife would move in with him.  I trust him with my son, but I don’t want my son to live and base his life in their house which will appear on the sex offender registry.  This is out of fear of bullying, emotional turmoil and missed opportunities.  Am I unreasonable and what are my options?**

Ok I’m going to try to be as detailed as possible which could lead to a long post, but I think it’s important.

My ex-wife–we’ll call her Michelle–divorced back in early 2016.  We had a long separation 2+ years because we have a son together and needed to setup both of our lives to be successful.  Our son is 6 years old and is so full of life. He’s really happy and both Michelle and I work really hard to ensure he knows he can love both of us.  We never talk bad about each other (not that there is anything to say) in front of him.  We always make sure we’re communicating and working together for our son’s happiness and best interests.  We regularly do mommy daddy dates with him, so he has a chance to be with both of us.

When we divorced we didn’t involve attorneys.  We had no assets (other than the human boy) and were able to work to come up with a parenting plan.  I have him 2-3 nights a week and every other Saturday during the day.  I would like more time closer to 50/50, but I travel for work and this was a good agreement for the time.

About 2 ½ years ago she started dating her current boyfriend.  We’ll call him Josh.  I found out about Josh from my son who was 3 ½ at the time.  I was frustrated that Michelle didn’t give me a heads up about our son meeting someone she was dating, but in the end, it was all ok.  I met him and tried to get to know him, but we don’t have much in common, so we became acquaintances who didn’t know how to act around each other.

Fast forward to last October.  Michelle and Josh had been dating for over a year and a half, I was dating off and on, things were strange, but typical.  Michelle and are proud expert co-parents and life is humming along.  Then one night I get a call from Michelle’s mother, telling me Michelle is having an emotional breakdown.  She asked if I could take our son for the night which was not a problem.  I tried to get some info as to what was wrong, but nobody would tell me what’s up, they just said I had to talk to Michelle.

Michelle called me the next day saying she needed to talk to me about something, but at a later date, and that she was ok.  I was extremely concerned for her and kept asking if she was okay and if there was anything I could do.  After a month she finally sat me down and told me that her boyfriend Josh had been convicted of raping his ex-wife.

I was floored.  I had no idea this was even going on.  Michelle carefully explained to me the situation, the details of the accusation, the trial and told me that she believes that Josh was wrongfully accused by his ex-wife to attempt to get custody of their children.  I trust her and believe her and understand why she would believe him.  I think it’s plausible that he really is innocent and for the purpose of this discussion I’d like to assume that he is.

Josh was sentenced a few weeks after Michelle filled me in.  He served 6 months I prison and is now a registered sex offender.  He lived in a halfway house for a few months and is now out on probation.  Josh is allowed to see his children, but currently is not permitted to be around my son.  But they would like to change that.

Michelle has been working with Josh’s attorney to get clearance from the courts to allow our son to be around him.  It requires me to write a letter to a psychologist authorizing them to interview our son to satisfy a court requirement.  I was never asked if I was alright with our son being around a convicted sex offender and that seems odd.  I guess the attorney asked Michelle if I was ok with our son spending time with Josh, which she told them yes.

Here’s the thing, I am ok with our son being around Josh.  I don’t believe he is guilty, so them spending time together with Michelle makes sense.  Josh is working on an appeal and there is a very solid chance that this will be overturned, and he will no longer be required to register as a sex offender.  However, there is no guarantee that the conviction will be overturned, and he is currently required to register for the rest of his life.

While I’m ok with my son spending time with Josh, I do not want him to live in a house that is listed on a sex offender registry.  This is due to the stigma, and social problems that will inevitably arise.  I can’t bear the thought of my son being bullied by children in the neighborhood, not being able to have his friends over to the house, or even worse poor treatment from other parents.

If Michelle marries Josh I want to take majority custody of our son and have him build his friendships and life in my neighborhood.  If Josh doesn’t have to register anymore I have zero problem with us keeping a similar custody arrangement.

So here is my question.  If I help Michelle work with the courts to allow our son to be around Josh would I be unintentionally giving up any legal leverage I would have to prevent our son from living there as a primary residence?

I don’t want to go to court to force a change to the custody agreement, but if I have to I will.  So, I have to know if allowing the psychologist to evaluate my son essentially okaying him to be around Josh would cause a problem later.

I told Michelle that I need more information today and that I don’t want our son living in a “marked” house.  It didn’t go well, which was to be expected.  She just wants this to all be over with, and I know she has thought about this.  But she thinks it will not be a big deal, and I think it absolutely is.  Am I crazy?  Am I in the wrong?

Here is where I’m at on what to do:

* I need to get documentation from Michelle on exactly what the process is, what they are trying to do, and what is required.
* I need to know exactly what ramifications occur as a result of our son being cleared to be around Josh.
* I need to make a clear plan as to what I think is an appropriate parenting plan if they get married.

Shouldn’t I have a say in this if we’re both equal guardians?  Should I hire an attorney?  I really can’t afford it, but I’m fearing that it might be my only option.  I hate this.  I adore Michelle still and don’t want to take her son away, but I have to be an advocate for him.  Please tell me I’m over-reacting or tell me I’m not crazy.  What should I do?"
"My [21M] roommate [21F] has lied to me and told me that my boyfriend [28M] tried “coming onto her”.


My boyfriend and I have been dating for 3 years..

I have a living arrangement with a few other people that go to my university. Including her, there are 3 other people that live here. I’ve never really interracted with her, other than the occasional “good morning” or “how was your day?”

A few days ago, she came to me crying and apologizing profusely. I asked her what the problem was and she told me that (at a party), my boyfriend was flirting with her intensely and was hitting on her. She said she didn’t know what to do so just went along with it.

I immediately thought her story was a little strange and inconsistent, as my boyfriend doesn’t go to parties, much less partied with a bunch of college kids. He’s rather shy, and doesn’t “flirt”, for lack of better terms.

I talked to my boyfriend about it, and he was confused. He had no idea where it was coming from, and he says that he’s never met the girl before.

Plus, the way she described my boyfriend was insanely out of character for him. Even if he were drunk, he wouldn’t do the things that she described to me. (He’s a pass-out drunk as well). She was saying that he said things that I know he would never say, and that he had even groped her. My boyfriend has literal social anxiety and never actually approaches people, much less flirt with them..

**tl;dr: one of my roommates lied to me and told me that my boyfriend had flirted with her and had done things that  I know he wouldn’t do (ex. flirting, groping)**

Why would she lie about this? I’m actually so confused. We have never interracted, and she had (imo) no reason to lie about this.. Should I confront her or just ignore her..?"
"My [24F] friend [26M] is projecting his body image issues onto me and it's making me feel bad


I'm a lesbian and my friend is a gay guy, which is kind of relevant here, since I feel like dating as a gay man is pretty different than dating as a lesbian—there's more pressure to be physically attractive when you're a gay man. My friend has had a lot of trouble dating lately and feels really bad about his physical appearance, and often talks about how he's fat, ugly, old, etc. (For the record, he's not overweight and looks handsome to me, but according to him, ""straight normal is gay fat."")

I feel bad for him, but lately he's been projecting this onto me. He'll joke about how we're both ugly and unlovable—it's self-deprecating jokes, not genuine insults, but I feel like there's a hint of honesty there. These jokes didn't bother me until I protested back, saying something like ""no we aren't"" and he shut me down and insisted that we are.

I'm overweight and probably not super traditionally attractive, but I'm content with my appearance. I also have a girlfriend and we have a good relationship, so I definitely don't feel ""ugly and unlovable."" But before I started dating her, I'd talk about mediocre dates and getting ghosted, and he'd suggest that it's due to my appearance/weight... again, framing it as ""maybe we get ghosted because of our appearance and weight"" rather than directly saying me, but that doesn't make it okay. I had a pretty bad eating disorder when I was a teenager, and he knows about it, which makes these comments worse. 

When I directly tell him that I don't like him including me in these negative comments, he usually says I'm being sensitive and it turns into a fight. Is there any way I can discourage him from making these kind of remarks without outright confronting him, since that tends to have bad results? To be fair, this doesn't happen super often, so I feel like calling him out for it might be starting drama for no reason.

**TL;DR - My friend is unhappy with his appearance and includes me in his self deprecating insults. How can I get him to stop?**"
"My (F20) family is upset because I don't want to take care of my sister's (F25) kid


So I'm currently a college student so I live at home with my family until I can save up enough money to move out on my own (We live in a very expensive city where a studio apartment starts at approximately $1300 a month).  My sister also lives at home and she has a kid. Her daughter is 3 years old. My sister works really odd hours so so most of the time she doesn't get home until around 1:00 or 2:00 a.m. Because of this it kind of falls onto everyone else in the house to help take care of her daughter. My mom picks up her daughter from daycare and takes care of her until I get home and then I take care of her until my sister gets home. In addition to being a full time student I also work part-time (but I try to pick up as many shifts as possible so I can save) so staying up super late to take care of my niece is incredibly inconvenient when I have homework to do and early morning classes and work the next day. I don't mind looking after my niece sometimes to help but it's getting to a point where I'm getting frustrated. I'm expected to babysit all of the time without anyone asking me if I have plans or if I'm okay with it. My niece also has very bad temper tantrums that results in her spitting, kicking, and slapping at me. My sister gets upset when I don't want to babysit when she wants to go out with her friends. Recently, she called me ungrateful because I refused to watch her daughter when she wanted to go out. My mom also told me I'm being unfair because I know that if I needed help with anything financially my sister would try and help me with it. I didn't make the decision to have a kid or be a parent so I don't understand why suddenly I'm expected to assume all of this responsibility. Am I just being selfish?

old thread: [click! ](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/9d4yxz/me_29f_and_my_boyfriend_34m_please_give_me_a/)

well, all of you were right. he took advantage of me, he lied to me. i suspect there is even more debt - well a lot more - than i suspected.

he told me he kept ignoring all his problems.

i do not know any specifics and i do not think i really want to. he is on a job at the moment, and returns this evening. i asked him to take what he needs for the week and come back for the rest the next weekend.

next week will be so hard. the only week in the year, we actually work together. the same event we met two years ago. i will ask to be put on an assignment as far away as possible put if push comes to shove we will spend the whole week in a room sitting next to each other.

i don't know if he ever loved me or if i was just a paycheck. at the moment i don't think, i'll ever be able to trust someone again. how could i be so stupid??

tldr: you all were right, he was a mooch, he lied to me and has obviously even more debt than he admitted. i broke up with him, he will (hopefully) move out within the week.

First of all, I dont know if my post will get a lot of attention but I just really need to confide into someone. Right now I feel like I have no way out but to kill myself out of shame, out of stupidity of trusting him, and out of not wanting to face anyone anymore in my life.

I met my bf online and very soon after he moved in to my 3 bedroom apartment that I was renting with another girl. He had been saying that he was waiting to start working but it ended up to be year after year of something coming up and he couldnt start work. A lot of things about him were mysterious and I did find out some things that he said that dont match up. We fought, we almost broke up, he cried and said that how can I not trust him..etc. We almost broke up a few times but I have met his parents and we were deciding to get married.

We are both living outside of the US in another country (I would rather not say for the sake of anonymity) but I am a student in that country - let's call it Country X and he is a citizen.  I am from Country Y. So he has been living with me in the apartment that I rented under the context of he's leaving soon to start working, but every time something will come up and extended his stay. I even ended up fighting with my roommate because she was angry that he still hasnt left after 2 years.

We went on living in the house together and one day he asked me to marry him. When my mom came to visit, he even brought his parents to the house to meet me and my mom. Now we have planned an engagement party and I am waiting in my country for him to come, but he has gone missing for two days. He was supposed to come on Monday but he has been incommunicado since Friday.

&amp;#x200B;

I reached out to his ex girlfriend who was still a close friend of his and found out things that made me dizzy. Apparently he has been like this before. He was taking money from her too. He didnt take a lot of money from me but we shared my student's allowance and we havent paid the rent for almost 6 months. And he has been getting money from his parents on the context that he will start working soon and will be paid. Oh man it is too much for me to type I feel like vomiting and suicidal thoughts are coming up.

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR : I have been conned by my 3 year bf, planned an engagement party, dress and invites etc but he has ran away leaving me numb

"I [15M] have a prosthetic arm and I'm starting to get more than annoyed that people seem to act as if I'm incapable of doing the smallest task.


I don't have a flesh and bone right arm. I haven't for years and I've come to terms with it. It sucks. It's not fair. But until a day comes that scientists figure out how I can grow a new arm like a lizard can with it's tail, I'm stuck like this. 

Lately I've been getting very annoyed with people, and it may be due to what's going on in my home life. I just find myself getting annoyed with people treating me as If I'm a small child. And I am still a kid, but I'm not a toddler, 

Do I struggle to do some things? Yes. 

Do I need help sometimes? Yes. 

But when I have my sister's husband try to pull my pants up for me when they were just slightly falling down at the mall is where I draw the line. I can pull my own fucking pants up. I'm not in a fucking wheelchair. Just because I can take my arm off doesn't mean I'm useless. 

How do I get this through to people? 

**TL;DR: People keep treating me as if I'm useless with always acting as if I can't do the most simple of tasks.**"
"Wife (40F) and I (39M) arguing over her friend's(39F) new boyfriend (38M)


My wife and I are generally good with communication and compromise, after almost 15 years together we have learned to read each other fairly well. However, a situation has come up which has put my wife and I at odds. Through one of her hobbies, my wife became friends with a woman call Jane. As often happens, Jane's husband Craig and I were thrown together at one event and turned out to be great company together. Over the last few years, our friendship grew and we started hanging out beyond any of the events our wives were concocting. 

About a month ago, my wife told me that Jane and Craig are getting a divorce. I was sad that my friends were going through this but it isn't really my business. I helped Craig moving some stuff, was an ear to vent to, and from what he said, it sounds like this was coming for a while. So, I kept my mouth shut, listened, and made appropriate grunts. It was the same when Jane visited, I was sorry to hear that they were going through this and commented on nothing else.  

This would have been fine until a month ago. Over the weekend, my wife told me that Jane and her friend Jim, Jane's former co-worker and new boyfriend, were going to have dinner with us. Again, I was fine with this as it is not my business. Dinner was fine although a couple of comments that Jim made had my back brain whirling and once everyone was gone, I asked my wife about it. It turns out that Jim had been trying to start an affair with Jane while they were both married. For the year or so that they worked together, Jim had been trying to woo Jane. Jane says that either 'she didn't notice' or 'wasn't sure what to do' depending on which story you get. 

Fast forward a week and Jane and Jim visited again. As gently as I could, I asked Jim what the deal was and managed to get his version of the story from him. Apparently, the moment he saw Jane he knew that he had to be with her. That his marriage had been dead for years and the more he got to know Jane, the more he was sure that she was in a similar situation with no sex, affection, or love. Throughout the time they worked together, he 'got close' a couple of times including 'some fun' at a Christmas party. After a year, he left the company and during the farewell party, it all sort of 'clicked' and they went from there. This means that they started all of this about 9 months ago. 

I can not describe how angry all of this made me. I know my anger is irrational but I feel like I have been made party to their affairs. I feel like Jane and Jim have sullied my friendship with them and I am struggling to process that. Add to that the cavalier way that Jim acted while they were both married just seems to press my buttons.

My wife and I are now at odds over this. While I would not ever tell my wife who she can be friends with, I do not want to be friends with Jane and I definitely do not want to be friends with Jim. My wish is that I get warned when they are coming and can make myself scarce. My wife argues that life moves on and I should find a better way to deal with this and, to an extent, I agree. However, in this situation I find myself wondering how to deal with Jim. From a deep part of me, there is this unfocused anger that they were doing this while they were married and I find that pretty despicable. If you are unhappily married, get a divorce. If Jim had come into the picture after the divorce then who am I to say anything.  I am far from perfect, I make mistakes, and I know that we should not judge other people but I look at this situation and my heart hurts. Telling Craig makes no difference in the divorce, otherwise I would and damn the consequences. Instead, it seems that this is the situation now and I don't know what to do. 

Any advice?

**tldr** Friend's wife had an affair. The new boyfriend is now being introduced and I find it very hard to interact with either of them because of their choices. Am I in the wrong here?"
"My [24F] husband [25M] jerks off every night but won’t have sex with me.


Dating four years, married one.


We’ve never had the greatest sex life. Neither of us have very high libidos, or so I thought. When we first started dating almost four years ago, the sex was good and frequent enough. Probably 3-4 times a week, which we were both good with. Two years into our relationship, his work changed his schedule and we were now working exact opposite schedules during the week and only seeing each other on the weekends. During this time our relationship crumbled. We never saw each other; he’d get home from work at 10:00 at night when I’m already asleep, and I’d leave for work at 5am, getting home just after he’d left for work. Anyway, it was a very tough year that he worked evenings. Not only did I never see him, but he barely replied to my texts, which was the bare minimum I told him I needed to feel okay with the situation. He said he understood and tried to comfort me, but nothing changed. 


It was months and months of feeling like I don’t exist to him except on Saturdays and Sundays, if I was lucky and he didn’t spend those playing video games. So after being ignored and feeling invisible, I looked at his phone. Yeah it was wrong, whatever, but we share passcodes and he’s allowed into my phone whenever he wants also. Anyway, I’m not going to defend myself because I just don’t care. What I found broke my heart. He’d been searching fitness models from his gym on instragram and Facebook. They’re not even clothed and he’d been looking at their accounts for about eight months. I workout and I try to keep myself fit for him, but there is just absolutely no way I can compete with someone with giant plastic tits and a huge butt. I’m by no means out of shape, but I was cursed with a small chest and high set hips which make my butt look weird. 


Anyway. I’m rambling. The point is, I was never seeing him, he was ignoring me, our sex life was nonexistent, then I found out he’d been doing idk what with inappropriate pictures of girls he sees at his gym every single day. Needless to say, I was uncomfortable. I didn’t confront him immediately though. 


A couple weeks later, he was showing me a pic in his camera roll and right above it was a screenshot of what looked like a porn website. So later I looked in his pics to see what it was. It was a screenshot of his login info for a porn subscription. My little heart I’d been trying to mend just broke right apart again at that. At this point, we were saving money for our wedding. And when I say we, I mean me. I literally paid for our entire wedding while he spent money on booze and porn subscriptions apparently. He won’t have sex with me, he barely even touches me, but he’ll pay money we’re supposed to be saving so he can look at plastic girls get fu*cked on the internet. It was only a month before the wedding though. That night, I confronted him. I was a sobbing mess, asking why he doesn’t like me anymore, why he even pretends to want to come home to me every night when he’d so clearly be with one of the girls from his gym, blah blah blah. It apparently took him by surprise that I even knew about all this stuff. Like he really thought I wouldn’t notice if he completely checked out of our relationship for an entire year. In the end, he apologized profusely and promised he would try to be a better partner. Right after the wedding, his schedule went back to normal and we saw each other every day again. Things didn’t change though. It’s been about a year now and we still only have sex once a week, despite both of us saying we would like to have more frequent sex. He never comes to bed at the same time as me though, and if I ask him if he wants to have sex, he says yes but then doesn’t get off his computer until after I’m already asleep. I work at 4am and have an hour commute, so I can’t really stay up late. I was frustrated, but willing to make it work. That is, until I found out he’s watching porn and masturbating almost every night. 


His computer is in our office, which shares a wall with our bedroom. It’s a very small room. So when I go in there in the morning and the entire room smells like a middle school age boy’s bedroom, it’s pretty obvious what went down. And then on his computer screen is a titty streamer that I told him made me uncomfortable when he watched her. So fast forward to now and my husband I guess either thinks he’s sneakier than he is or just doesn’t care that I know what he’s doing every night while I lay in bed and wonder why I’m not good enough for him. I have solid proof that he’s jerking off every night to porn/titty streamers/girls from his gym, I just have no idea how to bring it up to him. Masturbating is fine in relationships, I know that. However, masurbating is not fine in relationships when it’s affects your sex life with your partner. And this is, big time. So what do I do? How do I bring this up to him? What do I even say? We had sex twice yesterday at my insistence because it’d been weeks since he’d even touched me. And then last night, he still jerked off to porn. I’m just so tired.


**tl;dr: Husband jerks off to porn every night despite me saying I want to have sex more. I’m at loss for how to bring this up to him.**"
"Update: My [21F] sister [19F], is she depressed or is she just a brat?


[https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/7m67n1](Here's the old story)

I just wanted to update for anyone with crazy family members. 

So I actually took everyone's advice and moved out because I realised it definitely wasn't just my sister, my mother's just as bad. There was one incident where I realised if I didn't move out, I was going to go insane too.

They are both seeking professional help now, but because of incidents I won't bother to bring up, I have very little desire to contact either of them.

Moving out seemed like an insurmountable task, but turns out I could get government assistance. I had to support myself entirely for a few months which was incredibly stressful, but you could not pay me to move back in. 

I'm very sad about my lack of family, but a lot happier now I'm free of them. I also still get on well with my dad. I think my sister has been properly diagnosed and is taking her medication now which is good, so positive updates all around I guess. 

I'd love to know if anyone had any resources for family members of those affected by anxiety, depression or bipolar. That would be awesome. 

If anyone in a similar situation wants some support, I'm happy to lend an ear. 

** Tl;Dr: took the advice, moved out before I went insane. A lot happier :) **"
"My (27M) wife (27F) left me.


Two months ago, my wife left me. She had been acting a little weird for a couple months or so before that, spending a lot of time away from the house, but I thought she was working on her career.

We were married for 3 years and have a 2 year old son. 

She told me she left me for someone else, so I filed for divorce. Turns out she had some kind of mental break? I still do not know the details of that, as I do not believe anything she says and the mental health facility would not give me any information. But supposedly she did not have an extra-marital relationship. 

On Tuesday I bought her a cell phone since she lost hers, as well as groceries and ordered a replacement pair of glasses. I was the provider, so she has essentially no money. When I dropped her off, she cried, apologized for everything, and said she would do whatever it takes to put our lives back together. I was non-committal, but hopeful.

We had a court date 2 days later, on Thursday. She did not show up. I temporarily received full custody, and she gets supervised visitation 3 days a month. 

Yesterday, she made several posts on Facebook, 2 selfies with captions and a video. The selfies were captioned ""At boo's house, hope he had a good day at work, #LOVE #initforlife"" etc etc. The video was of her at a grocery store with another man, in which she referred to them having sex the day before, when we were supposed to be in court.

I don't really have a question, and I won't be contacting her unless it is about her scheduled visitation. I just don't understand how she can turn into a completely different person over a couple months. Was she always this person and just hid it? Did she change drastically over such a short period of time? We had ups and downs in our marriage, but she has always been a devoted mother. Now she can't even bother showing up to a custody hearing?

I left a lot out, but that is the gist of it. I am just struggling so much. I don't understand how she can move on so fast. It really hurts. 

TL:DR
My wife left me and I am struggling emotionally, while she has already moved on. "

"(Update)My(23M) GF(24F) doesn’t feel confortable with my friend(23F) and wants me to cut off contact with her. I don’t think this is fair

Hey everyone, I know I said I’d update but I wasn’t in the right place to write about it.

I guess to the surprise of nobody(except for myself), G and I broke up.

After posting I talked with my family and explained the situation, that I didn’t communicate well and whatnot. They were actually very understanding but the mood was still kinda awkward and unconfortable. Besides that, my youngest brother wasn’t on his best behaviour and he can hold a grudge. He’s 13 tho so I tried to cut off some slack(and knowing that F has been helping him with some girl problem I guess he was scared of losing a big sister figure), he was kinda short and sassy but nothing too bad.

We ended up leaving earlier bc I knew she was not feeling very well and I didn’t want her to feel pressured or something. We talked during the ride and I apologized for not being very clear and made sure to say I don’t have, never had any kind of romantic/sexual feeling for F, and neither does she. And that my family doesn’t want us to end up together.

I think she felt kinda conflicted and asked for a few days by herself.

We met up and she broke up with me, said that even tho, rationally she knows I would never cheat and that she believes me, she can’t feel confortable in a relationship like this.

In terms if break ups it was pretty ok, we both cried, then we talked and laughed but I think it was for the best, remaining in the relationship would only hurt us both.

Overall, she was my first serious gf, a great person and I’m glad we had this. I’m sure she’ll find someone amazing.

I’m taking some time off dating but I’m fine, I guess.

Ironically tho, F got a bf! I met him and they are perfect for each other, I happy for her. I told her why G and I broke up, she felt kinda guilty but I told her it was no one fault and advised her to explain clearly to her bf

TL;DR: I broke up with my GF, F got a bf, I’m taking some time off dating"
"My husband [26m] just told me [25f] that he is transgender, and I don’t know what to think.


My husband and I have been together for 8 years and have been married for the last 2. He is the love of my life, but has been battling depression for some time.
Tonight, after I told him I knew something was wrong/going on, he filled me in that he is transgender, and identifies as a woman. He states that he has felt this way since he was a child. He states he’s fantasized about going through the hormone changes, and that he wants to lose weight so that he can buy “cute” clothing. I am a very straight female, and I told him I don’t think I could deal with him transitioning. He said that we could stay together if I let him embrace his feminine side. He says that he loves me and that this changes nothing for his love for me.
I am completely lost. It is 4:30 in the morning, and he is sleeping beside me. I haven’t slept at all tonight. All I wanted was to marry, have children and have a happy life together. I’m worried he’s just saying that he won’t transition so I won’t leave him. I just truly don’t know what to think.

TLDR: My newly-out transgender husband says he won’t transition if it makes me uncomfortable."
"Me [29F] with my boyfriend [30M] 3 years, he's incredibly upset I am in a picture with an infamous politician in our country


My company had an event where a politician in my country was a guest. He's very close with the people up top in the company. He's also infamous in our country as being very corrupt and is considered to be an awful man by many. 




The department I work in earned an award which he presented to us and we all took a photograph. It made the front page of the newspaper with all twelve of us from this department and the politician. My boyfriend was incredibly upset about this. It sounds crazy but this man is the reason for a lot of bad things happening in our country. I've seen the comments on the picture as it is also on social media with some truly awful things being said about the women in the photo including myself for being in the same picture with that man. 




I've gotten a few odd text messages from friends and family and my mother certainly made sure I knew how much she didn't like that I was even in the same room with the politician. My boyfriend is probably the worst as some of his close friends and family worked in an industry that pretty much tanked in our country because of that man. To say that my boyfriend hates him would be putting it mildly. 



I don't really know what I can do. I feel attacked from all sides about this and the one person I hoped I could lean on because of this is also angry. He's not so much angry at me as he is angry that I even wound up near that man. But it's close enough that it feels as if he's angry at me and I can't really expect him to set aside his feelings about that. 



Do I just wait for this to eventually blow over? I didn't even know the politician would be there or that we'd end up in a photo together.


TL;DR corrupt, infamous and extremely hated politician in my country gave an award to the department I'm in and a photo made the newspapers and social media; I'm feeling attacked from all sides and my boyfriend is insanely upset"
"Me [25F] with my SO [22M] of 1.5 years, I bled internally after sex, and have mandated rest until the hemorrhage reabsorbs. He's... Not getting it.


Hey...! You guys have helped a lot but I just need to sort my thoughts with regards to this situation. 

&amp;#x200B;

So on Wednesday after sex I was in immense pain. I'd say it was the worst pain I've ever experienced, I think I passed out at some point as well. It was at night, I took an Ibuprofen and went to sleep once the pain calmed down, pretty much 1h30m after the pain started. 

&amp;#x200B;

The next day, I went to work but was still in pain all through my abdomen, so I went to the doctor and they shipped me to the hospital. After 8h, they finally were able to diagnose me with an internal hemorrhage due to the ""explosion"" of a follicule in my ovary, during sex. They checked my haemoglobin to make sure I was stable and told me to rest for the following days: no sudden movements, no carrying weight, and a hefty dose of paracetamol and some sort of opiate for the pain. I'm not taking them because I can handle the pain, but I guess for this reason I'm in quite a bit of pain. 

&amp;#x200B;

The following is what is bothering me. Throughout this I was completely lucid, but in pain and kind of scared. My bf lives with me and was a witness to this entire process, from afar. Didn't come to the doctors or the hospital as he didn't want to wait in the waiting room (which I did, on my own, from 5pm to 3am). Fair enough, but seeing as it's something that he was in part the direct cause of, it would have been nice to have some more involvement and concern on his part, especially when i was shipped to the hospital (which I took myself to btw, in a taxi). Next issue is that he really doesn't seem to understand how serious this could have been and what recovery means. Example: he wanted me to come grocery shopping yesterday (uh, NO), there is literally nothing in the house and he hasn't bothered to even go pick up some milk, eggs or bread. I was kind of irritated that he couldn't bring himself to even go pick up some food if I wasn't going to help or go with him. I bring groceries back when I come from work relatively often, but whatever.  

&amp;#x200B;

But what really took me over the edge in terms of how selfish he is acting, is that last night I was enjoying being on my own, chilling and watching youtube and netflix as he'd gone out partying. This was the night after being in the hospital until 3am. He send one text that he was coming home, and I replied not to come with people or to at least give me a heads up if he was. 

30 min later I get a message that he's coming up. I call asking if he's alone, and as I suspected, he's with a friend. They chill in MY kitchen, without going back out to continue partying, until 7AM. (they came home at 2). I asked a couple of times if they were planing on leaving but they did not catch my hint, so I went to the living room to chill on my own. They followed after 15 min and continued their drunk ass conversation. 

&amp;#x200B;

I went to bed at like 5.30. At 6.30 he came in and asked if I was angry. I told him I was not happy with him having turned up to the house with people when I expressly asked he do not (even if it's just our common friend). He went to sleep in the sofa, and now it's the next day, he hasn't said anything, hasn't apologised, is just hanging out in the living room without saying anything. 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm still in pain. At this point I'm hungry, I have important shit to do for monday which I apparently, need to go out and do myself at this point (I live on the 4rth floor of a building with no elevator). Wider context is that I work and my bf studies from home. He spends everyday at home studying and chilling, while I go to work and shit. I like being alone at home doing nothing, and I honestly don't get enough of that on a frequent basis. 

&amp;#x200B;

Anyway, if you're here by now, please help me sort out my feelings about this. I find he's acting so fucking selfishly. 

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR&gt; I bled internally. Am pain. BF isn't present for any of it, doesn't help with household chores, and brings people back home to drink without giving me a warning and ignoring me saying I didn't want to host.

"Messaging my [F28] friends/family/anyone back feels like an exhausting chore. I often let messages pile up for as long as a month before I force myself to reply.


I'll preface this by saying that I never used to be like this (and also sorry for the wall of text). In my mid-teens I would ring friends after school and chat for 2-3 hours. I used to text in class under my desk because I loved back and forth messaging. 

&amp;#x200B;

So I'm not sure how it got to this point. There's no traumatic event I can think of. According to some cringey old Facebook statuses I've been ""useless at replying"" since at least 2009. I do sort of remember being lazy with texting people back. Especially people who weren't part of my day to day (e.g. overseas friends, people not in my immediate friend group).

&amp;#x200B;

But now I'm at the point where I just straight up don't respond in a timely way to anyone unless it's work-related or urgent. I let messages build up and I get anxiety knowing that I have to reply but I just don't seem to have the mental energy to do it every day. So I end up waiting and then, like doing chores around the house, blocking off a chunk of time to just brute force reply to many people as I can in one go. 

&amp;#x200B;

My time-to-reply depends a lot on what the content of the message is. Conversations with overseas friends can be 2-4 weeks. Local friends up to a week. Family group chats between 2-4 days. Strangers up to 2 months or never because I feel embarrassed by the time that's lapsed. Sometimes I open a message and completely forget I even read it until I sit down to do one of my brute force sessions. I've missed invitations to events and other semi-important things because of this.

&amp;#x200B;

Although if a friend messages me about a celebration or death I'll usually find the energy to respond immediately or at least within a couple of hours. So I'm not crippled by this to the point that I can't be there for people in a time of need or shared happiness. 

&amp;#x200B;

The only other messaging exception is my Mom. If she calls me I always pick up or ring her back as soon as I can. If she's asleep when I want to ring back (she lives overseas) then I'll leave her a voice message and call her the next day. We chat at least once a week and text back and forth a bit every few days. So it's not constant communication with her but for some reason this doesn't feel tiring to me at all. Talking to my Mom is like having a cup of tea, it feels like a relief.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm also not lonely. I have a few close friends that I catch up with every couple of weeks so it's not like this is impacting my ability to be social IRL (although I will admit that I've definitely become flakier when it comes to making plans). I've always been independent and like doing stuff by myself too because I'm an extroverted introvert.

&amp;#x200B;

And it's not like I don't have time in the day to do it. I'll happily read a book or play a game on my phone for 30 minutes going to work in the morning but the thought of using that time to reply to people drains me.

&amp;#x200B;

I've started to tell people that I prefer to catch up in person and that I don't like chit-chatting online because it stresses me out. Long-time friends (of 5+ years) know this and are still my friends so I don't think I'm pushing anyone away (yet?). I know a few of them feel somewhat similarly.

&amp;#x200B;

But this has been going on for some time and I'm not even sure I know what's healthy behaviour anymore. Very rarely, when I'm making a new friend, I start to worry about them having expectations of constant communication. It's also rare, but sometimes I get angry or upset when I see a new message pop up. It feels like it's adding weight to me emotionally.

&amp;#x200B;

I guess I just wanted to find out what people think of this? Am I being super anti-social? Do I need therapy? Is there a way to better cope with this and learn to love chatting to people again? Is this a sign of mental illness? I'm posting here because I definitely feel like it's not healthy and I feel like there's something going on with me that I don't really understand.

**TL;DR: I used to text and call friends like crazy as a teenager but now, for some reason I can't fathom, I have anxiety over replying to people and tend to let messages pile up (even for as long as a month unless it's urgent). I feel like this isn't healthy but it's been so long I don't really know what ""normal"" looks like anymore. Is this messed up and do I need help?**"
"I (31F) never intend to have children. My mother (64F) is heartbroken. My best friend is 8 months pregnant. How do I help my mom, and how do I avoid putting my foot in my mouth?


I’m the middle child of three. I have known since I was 16 that I never want kids of my own. And when I was sixteen, I told my mom I didn’t want them, and if I ever changed my mind then they would certainly be adopted. She seemed accepting and all that, you know, 15 years ago. 

But three years ago, my older brother died in a really tragic accident. He struggled with addiction and mental illness for many years, and while they were not the immediate cause of his death, they were absolutely a major factor. We are all still in an incredible amount of pain over the loss; my mom in particular blames herself... and I will admit (but would never, ever tell her) that some of her guilt isn’t misplaced. We all feel guilt, and to a point, we all deserve to. This is not me blaming my mother. We all failed him to a degree; he deserved so much more than he got. 

So my beautiful, brilliant, tortured big brother — her eldest child — is dead. She will never have the grandchildren that he wanted to give her. My sister-in-law will never be the mother of his babies. They already had names picked out, and she wasn’t even pregnant. My younger brother is autistic and doesn’t even want *friends*, let alone a partner or a family. In one fell swoop, my amazing mama lost both her son and her entire future as a grandmother. 

Before he died, I was quite open about the fact that I didn’t want children. In the wake of his death, I am moreso. You see, addiction and mental illness aren’t exactly rare in my family. Three of my five cousins are addicts and my uncle died of a drug overdose and my grandparents might have lived decades longer if they hadn’t smoked like chimneys. I’m on medication for depression and anxiety, as is my mother, as was my brother, as are multiple cousins. Of those who are still alive we’ve got someone who’s bipolar and someone with autism and Jesus Christ, there are *only nine of us.* I’m not exactly anxious to pass any of that on, you know?

That’s just the genetic side of things. I love children but have no desire to be a mother. I will happily play with your kids all day but you’d better be willing to take them back at the end. I’m an extreme introvert and the idea of being responsible for another person 24/7 fills me with horrible anxiety and dread. 

I. Don’t. Want. It. 

My mom knows all of this. She admits she’s sad but would never want me to sacrifice my happiness just so she can have a grandchild. She doesn’t want that for me, and I love her so much for never pressuring me. She understands my reasoning, and I told her that if I ever change my mind I will let her know. But realistically, it’s been 15 years and I don’t think I will. My partner is aligned with my views on the matter, so we’re good there. 

**My issue is this:** my best friend is 8 months pregnant. I am SO GODDAMN EXCITED. Like I said, I love kids. I used to be a nanny. I love this baby so much already, and I’ve made sure he’s got a dinosaur-footed onesie ready for him when he arrives. I call him my nephew, because I’ll never actually get one of those. And of course I accidentally did this in front of my MOM. So now she has to deal with the fact that I never want kids but also that I’m stoked as hell for my best friend to have hers and immediately make him part of the family. Mixed signals, amiright? Apparently she got drunk one night while I was asleep and cried for a good half hour in front of my best friend about how I never want kids and how she has to grieve that now. Just sobbing. How she never wants to force me but it hurts her so much. This is not the first time, either. I just feel fucking awful. 
 
Just... what the fuck do I do? How do I navigate the birth and life of this amazing little boy while sparing my mom at least the pain of having it thrown in her face all the time? I’m at a complete loss. 

**TL;DR:** I never want kids and my best friend is pregnant. My excitement has made my mother more miserable about the fact that she will never be a grandmother. How do I help, or at the very least, not hurt?

"My boyfriend (M, 29) accused me (F, 27) of lying about being in pain + more


My boyfriend (M, 29) accused me (F, 27) of lying about being in pain + more

I suffer from endometriosis (for those who don’t know what it is, basically I’m in a huge amount of pain at least once a month) and ended up staying home today instead of going to work.

My boyfriend came home during lunch (works nearby) and when he saw me home, he started accusing me that I just wanted a day off, that I’m a liar, and ‘every female gets their period’.

At first, I was laughing because he has a jokester way about the way he delivers things but then I got visibly upset because the insults weren’t stopping and he told me to “shut up”. I got serious and told him that this wasn’t on and that I’m actually hurting and he walked out on me, slamming the door behind.

The whole incident made me feel alone, unsupported, and like he basically didn’t care about my feelings at all. I am not a dramatic person at all and almost always brush things off but I just couldn’t with this. I text him and told him why it upset me and he sent back texts that read -

""You need to cut it out""
""Will you relax""
""I can't even make a joke now""
""If you can’t take a joke, that’s your problem""
""I don't need the attitude""

I literally cannot talk to him about the situation and it’s making me think twice about the kind of person I’m with (there have been many other ‘careless’ incidents). Am I overreacting? Any advice?

TL;DR - Took a day off work, boyfriend accused me of being a liar, and made me feel even more shit for defending myself"
"My (18F) boyfriend (19M) constantly asks for sex, and says that I do not love him unless I have sex with him.


My boyfriend and I have been together for two years now. This only recently became a problem - within the last couple of months. 

I made it clear early on that I would like to wait until I am married before I have sex, and he told me that this is fine and he is willing to wait. 

However just recently he has been asking me for sex with an increasing frequency. It’s now got to the point where he’s “not sure if I love him” and that I need to “prove that I love him by having sex”

I always explain that having sex is not necessary in order to love someone. He doesn’t agree. I don’t know what changed, but it’s becoming more and more of a problem. 

I know a lot of people would say to just leave, but I really do love him a lot, and I think we can work through this. I’m just not sure how. I don’t know how to talk to him about it anymore. He often gets mildly upset when I say no. 

Where do I go from here? This is my first relationship so I have no experience in dealing with something like this. 



TLDR: my boyfriend continuously asks me for sex, even though I have explained that I want to wait until marriage. He gets upset when I say no, and thinks that I don’t love him unless we have sex. "
"My [23] mother [59] was diagnosed yesterday with liver and pancreatic cancer yesterday out of no where. The doctors say 6 months if we are lucky. How do I cope and stay strong for my dad [59]? What can I do to prepare?


Short background info; my mother was an alcoholic so we never had a close, or healthy relationship. She got DT’s my freshman year of high-school. She had a seizure and was dead for 15 minutes before being revived but suffered mental damage and is now sober, but disabled. She speaks slower and doesn’t always think logically or tell the truth (she thinks saying whatever the other person wants to hear is easier). We’ve been able to mend somewhat of a relationship between us but it’s not quite the same since she’ll never really be able to mentally make those close connections with people or talk about her feelings/thoughts. 

My mother recently evacuated with us from hurricane Florence because my dad was stuck in a foreign country on work. The week prior, she was in the hospital as a precautionary measure because her red blood count was mysteriously dropping and she was severely anemic. We discovered she has several small ulcers in her stomach and was put on corrective medication. During the week we stayed with family for evacuation, my mother barely ate and drink the whole time. She complained that her liquid diet at the hospital made her stomach shrink and she simply refused to take more than a few bites here and there. My dad said this was semi normal and too keep a close eye on her and take her to the doctor ASAP. 

Then we found out my ceiling collapsed at my home from Florence and my living room/bedroom is ruined and molded. My parents house also suffered extensive damage. We dropped my mother off with my sister [33] because we had to get back home, but still didn’t have power or a safe place to stay. We just got internet back about 15 minutes ago. My sister took my mom to the hospital again 2 days ago after complaining of severe stomach pain. They pulled 2 liters of fluid from her abdomen and discovered several tumors in both her live and pancreas. It’s cancer. 

The oncologist said it most likely began in her liver and continued to spread to her pancreas. We are currently awaiting a full body scan and biopsy to confirm if the cancer is anywhere else and the exact time we have left with her. The doctor said the best guess at the moment is maybe 4-6 months, possibly more if she responds positively to treatment. 

I’m just simply at a lost and I’m slowly losing my ability to handle all of this stress. Its been a non-stop shit storm and my dad (who I’ve never seen cry) is crumbling. My sister is also not handling this news well at all and is a wreck (understandable). I feel like I need to be strong for both of them and my mother but I’m losing my poker face and am honestly at a lost of what to do. My landlord is in the process of working with his insurance to get our home repaired but we still don’t have an ETA of when we will be able to return. 

My mom could be gone by Christmas and this doesn’t seem even possible to me. I’ve never had a family member or close friend die of cancer so this is completely new to all of us. I don’t know what to do or what to expect. My mom will miss all of my greatest life moments; my wedding, the birth of my children, etc. what can I do to prepare my family for the day she passes? How can I be strong for my family and how can I make these last months with my mom count? 

TL;DR: After a series of unfortunate events, we find out my mom has liver and pancreas cancer with maybe months to live. This is the first time our family has had someone so close be diagnosed. I need to be strong for my family and help make sure we are prepared for her passing but don’t know what to do or how to cope.  What can we also do to make the most of my mother’s time left for her and for our memories of her?

"Me [26M] is looking to move out from parents alone soon and my [24F] will still be home. Am I being unreasonable?


Hello all, quick version. We both work full time, fairly recent graduates. My job is far enough away that I'm looking to move out very soon, but it would add some distance between us, about 45 minutes as opposed to the 10 minutes or so currently. My commute would go down from an hour each way to 10-15 minutes each way. She is concerned with the idea that I will move out alone, and she will be stuck home (she can't afford to move out alone). She assumed we would move right in together, but I want a year alone to learn my own way, and be self sufficient and independent, this is very important to me. I'm not crazy and I should be moving out regardless of these facts yes? Thanks guys.

**tl;dr: Want to move out of home and live alone. GF is concerned we will see each other less. Is this an unreasonable thing to do?**

Edit: Been together about two and a half years now."
"My (34F) husband (39M) responds to every day conversation with a chip on his shoulder. It's an exhausting way to live.


My husband and I have been together 3 1/2 years and have an almost 2 yr old together.  


I'd say 60% of our interactions end on a negative note. It usually goes something like... I ask him a question about something (I've worked extensively on word choice and tone over the years) and he responds as though I've just insulted him or something.


He had just been outside for a bit,  I was watching our toddler and building a bookcase. I said ""hey, do you think you might want to tackle the rest of the kitchen pulls today?"" (It's something he's been ""in progress"" with for about 2 weeks) 


He responds by telling me how hot it is outside,  how he was just resting  (he was standing in the doorway watching me build the bookcase) and something else snarky about having to do it.  He generally takes things unrelated to him personally.  


These interactions are constant.  It's like I live in a field of land mines. I never know what's going to set one off. It's exhausting enough dealing with a toddler who has her own big emotions to deal with... but dealing with his on top of everything is just overwhelming.  


We have been to several therapists,  who help for a bit. He goes to see someone weekly now and I go to someone as needed. 


I've tried... talking with him about it (generally ends with him changing the subject to something he's upset about), finding and reading articles and books to him,  recommending he read about other things,  suggesting he talk to his therapist... and then some trial and error things like avoiding him or asking him every time something happens,  responding in a myriad of ways,  etc. 


I'm at my wits end and would love your perspective and any resources you may have.  


Tl;Dr husband takes things personally, responds poorly.  Would love your perspective on what more I can do.  "
"My [20F] grandpa [79M] is getting increasingly more inappropriate with our relationship and I’m not sure what to do?


I moved in my with grandfather and grandmother [both late 70’s] a little over 2 years ago after graduating high school. 
I live in their garage apartment on their land, in a  separate building away from their house so I practically live alone, although it is technically at their house.

For the first 2 years, I was practically never there. I was either working, going to school, dating etc. 
But for the past couple of months, I’ve been spending a lot more time with them because I realized that they won’t be alive forever so I should spend more time with them. 
As a result, I’ve been having more, grown up conversations with them to really get to know them and not in a granddaughter-to-grandparent conversation type of thing, and I guess that has given my grandpa an excuse to say more adult things to me? 

He’s been calling me more and more beautiful lately, which is sweet, but he’ll say things like I’m more than beautiful, I’m the best thing in the world, and what-not which I can usually not worry too much about.  But today, he made a comment about my outfit the other day saying I looked sexy (I was wearing nike running shorts, a big blue t-shirt that says Plattsburgh University, and a cap from Colorado) and he made a comment about how great my legs are.  

He’ll try and kiss me on the lips if i don’t pull away fast enough after a hug and so he’ll go in for a neck kiss instead. I get that he’s from a different generation and he just behaves differently than I expect modern men to, but it’s gotten a little weird and I don’t know what to say to him without upsetting him or making our relationship weird? I depend on him a lot for money and my free place here, so I’m very nervous that I’ll seem ungrateful for some odd reason after bringing up that his actions make me uncomfortable. How should I go about it? Should I reach out to another family member? My mom? 

tl;dr- I’ve lived with my grandparents for a little over 2 years now. Recently, I’ve started devoting more time to them and as a result my grandpa has been becoming more inappropriate. How should I tell him to chill out?

"My [30/F] best friend [29/F] is moving back to my hometown. Should I tell her her husband [30s/M] is not welcome in my home and that I don't want to see him?


I'll cut to the chase. Her husband is emotionally abusive. He broke up with the girl he was dating before my friend because he hit her and felt ashamed. Great. Glad he apparently felt ashamed but holy red flag, Batman!!  She says she knows her limits (I guess physical violence crosses the line but emotional abuse is acceptable).  I guess she's told herself that since he was apparently so remorseful about hitting his ex, he wouldn't *possibly* do it again. To me, it just illustrates that he's quite capable of becoming violent. Especially since I've actually witnessed him having an angry outburst - and that's putting it lightly. I actually thought he was going to break down the door. To make matters so much worse, they have an adorable  child. I'm so worried for my friend and that little girl. 

I think her husband is the one person I actually hate. Actually, I do hate one other person - her father, who is also emotionally abusive. For complicated reasons, she and her husband are moving in with her father for now. I feel so sad that she and yer daughter will be stuck between too abusive assholes. They're going to try to move to another state as soon as possible but right now this seems to be the only option (trust me, I tried going over her options with her). My question is as the title states: should I tell her I don't want to be around her husband? I guess if worse comes to worse I could come to her house just to give her a break but should I tell her her husband is not welcome in my home? I don't feel comfortable with him around but I'm worried if I say anything to her, he'll either use that to isolate her or she'll take offence and isolate herself. One thing I should mention is she's really sensitive so if I do tell her he's at least not welcome in my house, I'm not sure how I'd bring it up. So, I guess my question is: what should I say, if anything?

**TL;DR** Best friend is moving to my hometown with her abusive husband. How do I tell her that I don't want him anywhere near me? Do I tell her or do I just suck it up?"
"I (23M) am not allowed to go to my best friends funeral because my wife (25F) says soo


I feel sick to my stomach because I know the right thing to do is go and be with my late friends family. I'm not in my hometown, I'm hours away for school. My other best friend is offering to pay for tickets to and back and a place to stay. I was overjoyed and told my wife, then she revealed to me that she does not want me to go.

She said she's convinced someone might break in, or a pet could get sick, or I might miss my train etc. Another reason is she says she's going to cry the whole 24 hours I'm gone because her anxiety can't take it. I know alot of people with anxiety issues, I am one of them, but in the past I have let her go to a family funeral despite being in alot of mental distress because I thought it was the right thing to do. She's confused as to why I'm not sympathetic like I always have been, we had a tiny wedding, we don't travel, we don't do alot because of her anxiety and up until now I'm accepted it as just a natural part of her, but I feel this is overboard. It's 24 hours, I will not be sleeping for those 24 hours either, because the second I get into the city, the funeral starts, and then 2 hours later I catch a train back, it's the fastest possible.

This isn't the first time I havn't been able to go to a family emergency. My grandpa passed away earlier this year, and the same thing happened, the only difference is she had no sympathy for my grandpa's death because ""I don't even talk to him that often, so what's the big deal. I missed his wake and now I live with the regret. Am I thinking about this the wrong way? I just want to say goodbye to my best friend.

TL;DR My wife is guilt tripping me out of going to my best friends funeral because she has anxiety."
"Girlfriend came from a poor upbringing and her parents are still relatively poor. My girlfriend and I (both mid 20’s) are now comfortable, 6 figure combined salary. She has a hatred for anyone with money.


My girlfriend grew up quite poor in South America, grew up in a house with no roof and her parents begged for money etc. She started working from 17 and went to university by night and got herself a degree. We met 3 years ago and are madly in love, I am from a family that’s not at all wealthy but I never wanted for anything and my education was fully covered. We both now earn good salaries, combined 6 figures, and we are talking about buying a house together and getting new cars. We have worked hard for these, I work in IT, she works in Finance. 

Every time we talk about it she gets angry and seems to have hatred for anyone that has a house, has a nice car, or nice anything. I try to instill in her to be happy for those people and let’s work hard together and aspire to get these nice things for our potential future children. 

This hatred seems to be fueled by her mother as her parents still work pay check to pay check but make terrible financial decisions. Her mother is always filling her with hatred, is there anything I can do with my girlfriend to change a lifelong attitude of jealousy and bitterness? 



TLDR: Girlfriend came from a poor family, we now make good money but she hates everyone with money and acts severely bitter and jealous to people that have money, even though we aspire to have money. Her mother is very negative and has a victim attitude. "
"I [20M] confessed to my crush. She accepted a date, but i'm so stressed i don't know how to handle it.


Hello.

So for the past few months, i've had a crush on this girl. After akwardly talking to her a little, i recently told her. She's said that we can't go out together because we don't really know each other, but she's would accept a date with me.

On one hand, I'm really glad that she's didn't totally reject me. But on the other hand, i don't know what to do. I'm autistic, and always had problems interacting with people. I struggle to make a conversation even with my friends. I never had a girlfriend. I had 1 date, but it turned out really bad. I was so awkard and embarassing.

What should I do to make it work this time ? Where should i invite her ? What kind of clothes should i wear ? How are we going to get to know each other if i can't talk ?

I would appreciate any help or advice, thank you.

TL:DR : I have a date with a girl, but i don't know what to do"
"Girlfriend’s coworker told her he loves her


Long post:

My (Male, 21) girlfriend (Female, 20) and I have been dating for about two years now. A few months ago she told me she had a coworker who liked her, but she didn’t have any romantic feelings for him. She asked if I would be comfortable with them being friends. I was hesitant at first, but ultimately agreed.

Three days ago she left her phone at my house. My thumb print unlocks her phone (we’re both comfortable with the other person having access to our phones), so I went to message one of her roommates that she left her phone.

I found a conversation between her and her coworker where she tells him some of the problems we’ve been having as a couple, and he responded with some advice or whatever but he also mentioned something along the lines of “you know I love you”, and my girlfriend said back “..that’s the first time you’ve said that.”

I told her the relationship has an emotional element that I’m no longer comfortable with, and that she had to end the friendship. Plus, she didn’t shut down his advances, she passively encouraged them.

She says that they’ve talked in person about how she’s in a committed relationship and that he respects that, but I still feel like he’s testing the limits and she’s letting him get away with it.

She texted him telling him I found the “I love you thing” and he said something to the effect of “well I don’t really know what to say because there isn’t a way to explain that.”

When she went to work the day I found the texts, instead of ending things with him by having a conversation, she showed him our texts. That felt like a further betrayal of our trust and privacy. He said he would stay out of her life because he hated seeing what these problems were doing to her, which to me is simply him playing the good guy card.

She also deleted their Facebook messenger conversations between me reading the texts then seeing her again, which also seems suspicious to me.
(She has since asked him to screenshot them and send them to her, so if I want to see them I can.)

She keeps going back and forth about if she’ll end the friendship. I’ve told her if she doesn’t then it’s over, which she says is an ultimatum and unhealthy. And while I agree that ultimatums are unhealthy in most cases, this feels like a situation that calls for it. It’s as if she’s in two emotional relationships, and I think the one she has with her coworker is inappropriate and has crossed a line.

I’ve said many times over that if she had simply told him that wasn’t cool to say, then I would have been more okay with it, but instead she was complacent and allowed it to happen. Her defense is that he already knew the parameters of their relationship, but from my perspective he needed to be reminded.

As of right now, we’re on an agreed break where we aren’t seeing other people, and we plan on checking in with each other in a week or so.

Everyone I’ve talked to says this isn’t okay, and I have every right to be upset, but my girlfriend says that they’re all biased towards me, so I’m really looking for some unbiased strangers to weigh in.

TL/DR: girlfriend’s friend/coworker says he loves her, I want the friendship to end, she doesn’t."
"I spent my boyfriend’s birthday watching a beautiful sunset on a mountain top. By myself.


Very sorry for the long post, but I need some help. 

I (26f) met this incredible guy (24m) shortly after getting out of a really rough relationship. I wasn’t interested in dating for a while, but he was persistent, incredibly kind, patient, supportive and made it clear he’d continue trying to win me over for as long as it took. We did start dating, and a few months in the relationship became long distance. He is in the military and is now stationed about 4 hours away from me. 

I’m not your typically military wife. I’m very much career minded, absolutely don’t want children, and am on the fence about marriage. But once I got to know him, I’ve been willing to compromise on job locations and maybe (possibly eventually) let him put a ring on it if it means I get to keep him. (Still not budging on the kid thing.)  

The distance has been tough, but we’ve done a pretty good job of keeping it fun, and he’s not too far away, so visits are frequent. The distance is still pretty new (3 mo, together for 8mo), so we’re still learning. 

Here’s the problem. I’ve been to see him 5 or 6 times. It’s easier for me to get off work. Visits there are wonderful. He’s been home twice. Both times, he’s spent VERY little time with me. He grew up here and his family lives here along with his closest friends, so I COMPLETELY understand him wanting to visit with and spend time with them. I know all of his friends and I’ve met most of his family, but he NEVER invites me to join him at his family’s house or go out with his friends. When he’s home, I’ve only been seeing him at night when he comes back to my house to crash. We usually get breakfast together the next day before he’s off to see someone else. 

After his last visit, we talked about how I was feeling disappointed about the minimal amount of time I got to spend with him. I asked for at least 1 good dinner date every time he comes home and he agreed. 

He’s home for his birthday right now, and took a few extra days off for a longer visit. He got too drunk with his brother last night to drive back to me so he slept there. I didn’t see him until lunch today (which is his actual birthday), and I was pretty hurt that he stayed out last night. I had bought food to make him breakfast and bed and had planned on waking him up with a birthday blow job complete with some new lingerie he hasn’t seen yet. After lunch we walked around town for a while and went back to my place because he wanted to nap. He slept until shortly before he had to go to his family’s house for birthday dinner. As his girlfriend, I’m assuming I’m invited. I’m not. Then he mentions going to one of our favorite bars for drinks afterwards. Once again, I’m assuming I’m at least invited to that. I’m not. He apparently just wants to spend time with his brothers. I’m obviously upset. He does very little to comfort me. He leaves, I go on a hike to clear my head, get home well after sunset, don’t hear from him until 10pm, which was a text asking how I’m doing. I told him I’m hurt and that’d I’d like to talk about it. Two hours later I get another text saying he’s going out with the guys tomorrow night and he’s sorry he’s not inviting me but he never gets to see them. Literally nothing else. At this point I’m crying. I call to see where he is and if he’ll talk to me about it. He’s drunk and says we’ll talk tomorrow and he’s staying out. Tomorrow night is the last chance for that dinner date he promised me before he goes back. I’m going to go ahead and assume that’s not happening. 

At this point I feel like a side chick. Maybe not a side chick to another girl (or maybe so, who knows), but definitely a side chick to the rest of his life. It seems like I’m not a priority and he’s compartmentalizing me instead of making me a part of his life. This behavior is very new and it wasn’t like this at all when he lived here so I’m very confused. 

I don’t know what to do. I want to hold on to this one. He means a lot to me. But I also don’t feel like he’s treating me right. He’s been cold and uncommunicative on this issue too, which makes me worry. Do I call it quits? Do I give him another chance? 

TL:DR - long distance boyfriend doesn’t include me in time spent with family and friends. "
"I think my husband (39M) hates me (28F). 7 year marriage.


Throwaway account because my husband knows my username, also repost because I forgot to list ages/genders. We've been together for 7 years, we started off as friends/coworkers and that blossomed into romance. Things were going fine and about a year in we said the L word and from there it was clinched.... for about a month. We went to a concert with my best friend and he got upset that I ignored him most of the night and after we got home he broke up with me for the first time. I cried and pleaded and we got back together and I feel like it's just been a cycle of that throughout our time together.


Some of the worst incidents include walking out of my apartment in the middle of the night on my birthday after a huge fight where I indulged that when we weren't exclusive I had also been on a few dates with another coworker (neither of us totally innocent there). We were going to be going out of town the next day for a birthday trip and he showed up about an hour later apologizing and we had a good trip. On our honeymoon in Paris we got in a fight and he told me he wanted a divorce and left me alone in our hotel room. That time it was because he had asked me to hold his passport and it fell out of my bag (the club emailed us later). Those are only just the 2 biggest examples, and each time I truly felt at fault because of things I'd done. 


We'd been doing fine for a while then last weekend it was my favorite time of year at my favorite convention. He didn't request off work so he came to meet me Saturday night and got mad that I wanted to stay later than he did, he was being sulky and mean all night and it clearly ruined my time. He felt really bad about it and we had a great time the next night, then the following weekend my best friend got engaged and we planned to have a game night with her and her fiance to celebrate. He had to work the next morning again and asked me to head out around 11, I had drank a little much and lost track of time wedding planning with my BFF. In the car on the way home, there it was... ""I'm done with you, I want a divorce"", because I was selfish and didn't value his time and that he had to be up early for work 2 weekends in a row. I broke down, I've already been struggling with a bad depression with my new career and feeling inadequate plus I feel guilty we're about to move 90 minutes away from our beloved city to another town for my new job. I told him everything, how I'd even been having some suicidal thoughts. I thought it was a real coming together moment when we reconciled and maybe he'd finally realized what he'd been doing to my psyche all these years. In between the big fights I feel like I can never do anything right and he criticizes every little thing I do, it's so hot and cold. 


Today we went to brunch at our favorite place since tomorrow we move. He asked me if we had to move all my books and if we could donate them to charity/get rid of them. (It's a bit of a sticking point, my book collection.) I may have raised my voice more than I meant and said ""No, stop asking me to get rid of one of my favorite things"". He said I embarrassed him and wouldn't talk to me after that. Then I told him if he wants me to just move tomorrow without him I'll do that because I can't take this anymore and he acts like I'm the crazy one for suggesting that and I'm overreacting. He says that I obviously haven't forgiven him and now he doesn't feel like he can be normal around me and it was just one thing and that I'm making it into something else because of our past. I don't know if I'm being gaslighted or genuinely being crazy. Is our marriage salvageable? When it's good it's great, and I do love him. But it's made me question myself and whether I'm worthy of being with anyone. Please help. 


TLDR: Husband is hot/cold and we're in a neverending cycle of him telling me he wants a divorce/is done with me, then telling me I'm great and he'll never leave. What do I do? "
"I (25f) got a random text late at night, my fiancé (31m) insists that my reaction to it was inappropriate.


My man and I worked at a strip club together about 7 or 8 months ago, he was the DJ, I was a waitress. I exchanged numbers with someone he told me was his friend but never actually had any communication with the guy until I got a message that just said ""hola"" tonight at 12:30am. I didn't recognize his name immediately but based on the fact that I personally know anyone by that name, I assumed he was from the club and was hitting me up for... well, the only reason guys hit up a girl from a strip club at midnight. 

I told my fiancé ""I think I just got booty texted. You know, like a booty call? But a text. I don't know who it is, someone named Jaime J?"" Whatever, I didn't really care. It's late, I didn't want to deal with it right then because I have to work in a few hours and I needed to get some sleep.

Turns out it was aforementioned ""friend"". Now, the last time I saw this guy, I called him out for trying to touch me inappropriately, asked him how he could disrespect me and his ""friend"" like that. He grabbed me by the lapels of my jacket and yanked me towards him saying ""because I fucking like you okay?!"" I got him kicked out of the club and haven't talked to him since. 

When I didn't respond to his text tonight, he texted my fiancé asking if we're still together, so my initial assumption was correct. Now my fiancé is upset because of the fact that I assumed it was a booty call. He says I could ask anyone and they'd say the same thing, that it was an inappropriate way for me to tell him about the text. I maintain that the only person in the wrong here is the idiot hitting me up at midnight... and now, to a point, him for making a big deal where there was none. So here we are. Help. Please. 

Tl;dr: Fiance is upset that I correctly assumed the intentions behind a late night text. I think there's only one reason a guy would hit up a woman from a strip club. Am I actually in the wrong like he says?"
"I can't afford another kid, wife wants one or might leave me...


She wants a third soon, I want to wait.  Right now, I’m $20K in debt including a car loan.  She’s been a SAHM since our first and I had to drain our savings and switch jobs to keep us afloat.  She used to work until her first pregnancy.  Afterwards, I asked if she could help with the bills if she can and picked up up babysitting instead to stay with our daughter. Despite our efforts, we had been struggling to keep up since we moved to a new area for my work and had whatever leftover I made go to our daughter or to help her brother get back on his feet. So, I decided to go back to school on my GI bill and use it to save and pay our debt.  However, the last year we didn’t put a lot into our debts and instead had to be a cosigner and help with the deposit for her brother.  She was also buying a lot of baby stuff to sell it back because it wasn’t what she thought it would be without looking at it.  She told me having debt is normal and we will pay it back later with the rest of my GI bill down the line.  But, after seeing her spend almost everything we have on baby things and her brother, telling me I’m selfish for wanting to save a little.  To add more to it, she’s pregnant again doing the same thing and wants a 3rd kid soon.  I don’t have a degree living in a one-bedroom and she thinks I’m selfish for not helping her.  I told her that it’s been a financial burden on me doing 20+ hours of OT every two weeks on top of full time school. I told her it’s a bad time and after I grab my degree we can work on it, but she’s impatient because she thinks it’ll be hard for her down the road to have kids. (she’s 26.. I’m 28). 

She told me we are doing okay and I think she is delusional being in a small space 24/7 with our daughter, pregnant and wanting another without knowing if I’ll be paying off enough debt to move somewhere better than a one-bedroom and don’t need to work 20+ OT.  Am I selfish?

Tl;dr Wife wants a 3rd kid, I know we aren’t ready and I’m working my ass off and going to school.  Might threaten to leave me if I tell her no. Am I being selfish?  What advice would be helpful?"
