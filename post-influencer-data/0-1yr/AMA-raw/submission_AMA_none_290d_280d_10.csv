2,"One Dad died from cancer ones dying from Parkinson's.


I'm sure some Reddit users are going to deep dive my account. IDC. My stepfather left for CVS, 5010 Florida Ave S, Lakeland, FL 33813 via uber to get meds for his condition, patches to be specific. I could be rude and judge someone by their profile pic. I have my own opinion on why the driver kicked him out over the vehicle. But still, my point and concern go to Uber to whom we trust to carry our family and our infirm because we cant. IS THIS OKAY? 2-3 hours later he barely got home in a cab. Trust me I would love the clout and attention. (Figure it out) But what I love more is a meaningful relationship with a man who raised me. I don't think I am allowed to post anyone's credentials via this site's rules but any help I can get besides ASKING A DISABLED MAN TO NAVIGATE A WEBSITE TO CUSTOMER SERVICE would be helpful. I'm not even sure if its social justice. But don't fuck my last dad! I'm going to fuck you if I can. AMA while I find somewhere else to post. "
