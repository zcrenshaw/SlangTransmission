1,"Three years ago, my wife and I played our first escape room and fell in love with them. We opened our own escape room business in July 2018, and today operate 3 unique games that we designed from scratch. We recently became profitable and are making plans for our next two games! AMA!!

2,"I am a late-20s office worker and also a Hong Kong protester AMA


Due to the large amount of news and misinformation coming from Hong Kong I thought I would do an AMA so people could ask me about my experiences as a protester in Hong Kong

I also decided to do this AMA as I feel my mental health being effected by uncertainty about the future of Hong Kong, a fear of the police and memories of some events I have seen during the protests. As all the people in my life are either strongly against the protest or strongly against the police it is hard to talk to people that are not full of gloom and hate. I thought speaking to more neutral people here would help me overcome a lot of my current issues. 

I am using a throw away account for obvious reasons 

Please note I am by no means a spokesperson or a front-line protester   

Here is the best [proof](https://imgur.com/a/EJDH9y9) I could think of 

Here is a full list of all protests I have been to, however I am a happy to answer questions about all protests that I can 

16/6 - Hong Kong Island 2 million man march

1/7 - Hong Kong Island march and siege of LegCo 

7/7 - Tsim Sha Tsui Chinese tourist appeal march 

21/7 - Hong Kong Island march to Sheung Wan

27/7 - Yuen Long anti-triad/police collaboration march

28/7 - Hong Kong Island Charter Park gathering 

3/8 - Mong Kok to Tsim Sha Tsui march

4/8 -  Tsueng Kwan O march

5/8 - Hong Kong wide strike and Mong Kok gathering 

9/8 and 10/8 - Airport sit-in 

11/8 - Sham Shui Po to Cheung Sha Wan march"

4,"I am a Certifed Cheese Expert, AMA


After a few folks asked about it, I figured I’d put up an AMA about my “cheese degree”.  It’s a certification given by the American Cheese Society called the CCP, or Certified Cheese Professional, after taking a very involved and difficult test all about the history, science, style, geography and agricultural information of the best food in the world...Cheese!

8,"[21M] I came out as gay to my parents, and they decided that they never want to see me again... I'm kind of depressed... AMA!


About a week ago I decided to come out to my parents... Honestly, I did not expect them to react the way that they did. They got REALLY mad... They basically told me that that was something that they couldn't tolerate. They are simply not answering any of my phone calls, and when I tried to go to their house in order to reason with them, they simply ignored me... I contacted my uncle to see if he could maybe speak to my parents for me, though when he brought me up, they kicked him out of their house...  
I honestly don't know how I can get out of this mess...  I am currently staying in a hotel, and I am working on getting an apartment.  


Feel free to ask me about anything, I just need to talk to someone right now..."

14,"I had a rare condition called Alice In Wonderland Syndrome when I was younger, AMA!


It’s where while you’re awake objects or yourself keep growing or shrinking in size. You could look at an object and it suddenly gets huge, or is suddenly right in front of you instead of across the room. You could look down at yourself and be 10ft tall, or be 2ft tall. 

I had this throughout my childhood and it was terrifying, it still freaks me out now.
