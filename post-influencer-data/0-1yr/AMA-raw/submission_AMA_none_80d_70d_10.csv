I am her grandson 29(M) and  I've told my Omi (grandmother in Austrian) that we could right a book based on her experiences. I will be relaying questions you ask to her and responding as close to verbatim as possible. Attached is a link to a picture of my Omi playing with my cat https://www.instagram.com/p/BzYF_jVA8wXP7AkpErIpOHXUSLxxDbmGP3Ol8Y0/?igshid=14ygdvj9zwv1r"

3,"I'm 37 and having the same symptoms I did when I had cancer as a teen. I'm afraid to go to the doctors because I will commit suicide if I do.


This is a promise to myself. I don't have the money, support group, or the energy to deal with this again. I'm not getting sick to get better again. I'm not going to loose my hair and look like a victim again... I'm frightened to get checked out."

6,"For the first ten years of my life, I grew up in a theme park. AMA


To explain the title, My Father was a ride mechanic and my mom worked in the concession stand at a place called Jungleland in Atlantic beach NC. Most of my childhood was spent there because my parents worked mostly all day and if I wasn't in school I was there, to which they couldn't afford babysitters every day. I spent most of my time swindling the arcade workers for free games and my dad taking something out of the engine in the bumper boats to make them go 20 MPH. Ask me anything!"
7,"I found my dog in the bush forest after being missing for 5 days, alive. AMA


The vet said he most likely won't last the night but im trying to keep him alive.

When I found him he was hardly alive."

"
9,"I was raised as a Jehovah's Witness for almost twenty years. AMA.


I'm so hurt and bitter at the way I've been treated by my so called brothers and sisters. Since I've spent most of my life in the religion I know all the dirty secrets they've been trying to hide. Feel free to ask anything."
10,"I'm in my 30s, and I'm a lifelong bedwetter. AMA.


I'm a guy in my mid 30's. I have a wife and two young children. I have no general disabilities. Although I've had some degree of bedwetting issues basically my whole life, about 7.5 years ago I started wetting the bed regularly again (multiple times a week), which hadn't been the case since elementary school, so I went back to wearing diapers at night.

I'm also a moderator for r/adultbedwetting.

I think adult bedwetting is more common than most people realize ... AMA.
