0,"I'm a 23 year old woman and today (11/3/18) I'm one year sober from drugs and alcohol! AMA.


"
1,"Currently sitting in my dorm room with my pants off under the covers and my roommate and his friends walked in and now I'm trapped here for the foreseeable future


Had intended to end No-Nut November, figured my roommate would be gone for a while. Needless to say, he came back sooner than I thought he would with his friends in tow. Now I'm trapped in my bed until they leave (which doesn't look like it will be any time soon). Ask me anything!"
2,"I'm a child services social worker and I specialize in mental disorders, developmental disorders, and sex abuse. AMA!


I spent quite a bit of time working for Child Protective Services, specially in the sex abuse department, and I currently run a program that helps at-risk children that is mostly geared towards helping children who have experienced trauma."
3,"Dad (68M) and son Sean (23M)


Hello! My son (23) and I (68) are doing an AMA for father/son relationship questions. The generational gap! (My son is typing this in case anyone is wondering)."
4,"I married someone for purely economical &amp; societal reasons AMA


I don't love him but I am pretending to love him deeply for over a decade now. We appear to be the perfect couple. If you care, ask me anything from ""How is your sex life?"" over ""What are your specific economical and societal reasons?"" to ""What do you really feel about him?"".  

I want to confess but I will never atone for what I have done."
5,"I am a human trafficking researcher. AMA (again)


Almost a year ago I did an AMA on human trafficking, and recently have been getting a lot of PMs about it. So, why not hit round 2 of this!

Basically, I am a human trafficking researcher (currently working on a PhD in the field), and the co-host of a research based podcast on human trafficking, Speaker for the Living. Please feel free to ask me anything! I am still US based, but I have experience abroad as well.
