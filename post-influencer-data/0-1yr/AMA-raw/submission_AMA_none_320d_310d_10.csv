0,"I️ work on one of those ghost-hunting reality TV series. AMA!

1,"I’m 25 years old and was diagnosed late last year with end stage renal disease, causing me to be on dialysis since. AMA.


Hey guys, figured it wouldn’t be the worst idea to use reddit and spread the word of my situation as well as maybe answer some questions of people who also have kidney issues. 

Anyways- I was diagnosed with berger’s disease in early December of last year after dealing with a variety of symptoms for a couple months prior. I left my graduate school program and now am looking for a kidney donor so I can resume my life. 

If you want to spread the word a bit or possibly look into donation, please visit my Twitter here https://twitter.com/finna_see/status/1029389783980826629?s=21

Hey! I've been using Reddit without loggin in for a long time. I used to make random posts here but with a different account. I was looking through them and then I remembered that it was a good way to spend some time. So AMA!

Also if you want some info about me:

\-I'm 19 (20 in 2 months)

\-University student

\-Asexual (or somewhere between demisexual and asexual idk)

Don't limit your questions with these though."
