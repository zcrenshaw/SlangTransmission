My name is D.L. Stewart and I am in the process of getting my first novel, The Battle For Metagore, published. It's just over 108k words long, and is about a kingdom of 6 realms falling into a civil war.

&amp;#x200B;

Blurb:  
The death of the beloved Lord of Metagore, followed by the crowning of a successor, stirs discontent among the grand dukes. They decide to deviate from the kingdom, and each assumes lordship over their own realms. The new lord, angered by the rebellion, declares war on the renegade dukes, now claiming to be lords. Unexpected twists and obstacles surface as the battle for the crown ensues.

Who will prevail in the battle for Metagore? Pick a side, and see how long they will survive the armies of their foes, the dangerous wildlife lurking around every corner, and the sometimes-fatal climates.

9,"I am a Pedophile, AMA


I'm here because I actually want to discuss the topic of Pedophilia with people who are strongly against it. I want to try and understand their position and explain the reason and logic behind my position. 

I've tried it on here before but posts usually get down voted to oblivion so I thought I would try something different. 

If you want to ask me questions or debate me about pedophilia, please add the snap account: redditsnapama and message me on there. 

Note: Anything illegal sent to that snap will be reported to the police. "
