0,"On my 16th birthday I got my ass kicked by my parents and kicked out of the house because I refused to marry my first cousin. AMA


Throwaway account because this isn’t something I like talking about much and is the root of the anxiety I deal with to this day. I’m 35 years old and happily married for 12 years (no I didn’t marry my cousin or anyone remotely related to me lol) and have 3 beautiful children. 

I attribute a lot of my success on letting the past go to an LSD trip I had 2 years ago that put things in perspective for me."
1,"I’m celebrating 2 years clean from self harm today! AMA!

2,"I catch pedophiles online as a hobby. AMA


My and my friends (me, one guy, and a girl), all post as a girl on various social media sites, looking for active pedophiles.

&amp;#x200B;

The process boils down to:  
\- Pose as a girl online  
\- Post suggestive (never sensual or revealing) content  
\- Wait  


We then lure the person into telling us their location, phone number, name, etc. (call to make sure it isn't a fake, and check public records with phone # to make sure they match). Then we do an anonymous report to the cities police department with the information via their Facebook / website. Excited to talk about this with others, AMA"
3,"My mom has a rare form of synesthesia where she tastes words. Ask her anything!


Lexicial Gustatory Synesthesia for anyone wondering what type!"
4,"In January I passed my 7 year sober mark. AMA

5,"AMA and then edit your question to make me look stupid.

6,"My fiancé and I have lived in our van for 1 year now, travelling 30k miles across the US, visiting 34 national parks and still going. We also love to track stats + have logged all places showered, cities visited etc etc. AMA!

7,"I lost my health, job, girl, apartment, and cats (in that order) in less than a month. Life is a fuckin wild ride. AMA

8,"Recently found out I'm a sociopath, AMA


Modern term is ASPD but sociopath is the more well-known term (and frankly it's more eye-grabbing). I want to attempt to explore this because for the first time my confusion about the world makes sense.

No, I'm not a scheming future serial killer. I have no intention of killing anyone. I'm well-adjusted and I care about my family. Just not in the same way normal people do."
9,"I'm a 17 y.o. Grandmaster of Memory. AMA.


So, there's this sport worldwide wherein ""memory athletes"" compete against each other to memorize hundreds and thousands of abstract information (e.g. binary numbers, numbers, cards, images, words, historic dates, sounds, etc.). In order to be a Grandmaster of Memory, one must be able to do all of the following feats:   
1) Memorize a deck of 52 playing cards in under 2 minutes.   
2) Memorize 10 decks of playing cards in under an hour.   
3) Memorize 1000 random digits in order in under an hour.   


That's it! I memorize competitively, and I'm one of the top competitors globally. AMA."
10,"I realized my ex-husband was right: I did (emotionally) abuse him. AMA


My ex-husband and I have been separated/divorced for nearly six years. At the beginning of our separation, he accused me of being abusive, and I was like, ""What? Go fuck yourself."" Turns out, he was right. I have since apologized to him, have taken ownership of my part of the destruction of our marriage, and continue to work on myself so I am the best mother I can be to my children. I've seen posts where people wonder if abusers ever see the light of day; so here I am: ask me anything."
