0,"I have had a stressful day and I just want my karma points up so I can make post in the NBA sub. ama. anything and I will answer truthfully


"
1,"I loaned $1300 to a complete stranger 6 months ago and today he contacted me to pay me back.


I heard about a guy in local media who was having a rough time. Contacted him and asked how I could help, so he told me about some money he needed, we met later that day and I gave him the cash."
2,"I served a life sentence for Murder. AMA.


In 1988 I killed someone. I was 18 years old. I was sentenced to life imprisonment with a minimum tariff of 15 years. 

I was released in 2003 on a ""life licence"", basically meaning I will be monitored for life. I welcome people to ask questions, but if you're part of the ""hang 'em and flog 'em"" brigade, then don't bother.

I work full time. I live in my own apartment."
3,"I suffer from Alice in Wonderland syndrome, neuropsychological condition that causes my perception of distance and size to change without warning, AMA.


Yep, it’s weird. As I’m typing this I’m looking at a 13 gallon trash can that appears to be about 6 inches tall. Fun stuff."
4,"I am visiting USA from India for first time for work. What a strange place, honestly. AMA


I visited Dallas, Texas. Then New York city, and now in Boston. All good cities, and positive experiences. But extremes of everything are present. You will see the fittest people. Then you will see the fattest people. In New York, I saw flats selling for 10 Million dollars. But right outside, people begging for change.

Before coming here, I had a very different idea of USA, mostly from watching TV and reading Reddit. I thought everyone had personal pronouns you had to use. Nothing like that, I didn't even get a hint of such a thing. I thought everyone was unhappy and depressed. Atleast my colleagues are really happy and cheerful people, who live life to the fullest."
5,"Just got my final grades in for a class I’ve been working extremely hard for. Finished with 269 points in the class... an A is 270+. AMA


"
6,"A duck bit me on the nipple today. AMA.


"
7,"I was imprisoned for Manslaughter. AMA.


Sentenced to 8 years, served 4 in prison and 4 on parole.

In 2010, I was in a 20 year old in a 2 year relationship with a girl. One evening, when I came home from work, I found her in bed with another man.

After a heated argument I punched him really hard in the face. He died on a brain hemorrhage the next day.

I pleaded guilty to Manslaughter and received an 8 year prison sentence. I was released on parole after 4.

What am I doing now? I work as a full time kitchen porter at a restaurant."
8,"I put you to sleep for surgery, AMA!


I've been getting quite a few messages about anesthesia again lately and thought I would see if I could answer some questions. I like my job and I enjoy explaining it to others to hopefully help ease your fears."
9,"I’ve worked in adult novelty retail (sex toy) sales for seven years, and am a current student working towards practicing clinical therapy, eventually to focus on sexual health, AMA.


"
10,"I'm a Male who was raped by another Male about 3 years ago. AMA


"
11,"I’m a (closeted) gay Latter Day Saint(Mormon), I’ve attempted suicide and am now dating a furry. AMA


My life has never been a happy one, 4 years ago I discovered I was gay, told what I thought was a good friend and got sexually assaulted for it. I felt broken and attempted to end my life, after a couple of damn bad relationships I found someone I love. They are a furry though. I’ll try to respond to all questions!"
