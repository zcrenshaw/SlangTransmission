0,"I’ve always wanted to do an AMA. I know I don’t have a cool job and I’m not very pretty and I don’t have a dog or anything but I feel like I could answer some questions. You don’t have to ask me anything but if you did I would be really happy. AMA.


"
1,"I AMA Flight Centre employee, and this is a whistleblow and serious warning to protect both customers and future job applicants.


I have been planning to post this for over a month, finally having a few days off to sort my thoughts. However, with the release of the ABC article beating me to it I regret not posting sooner, but do feel relief to have some backing more than anything.

This post will be structured into two sections – the short version for all, and the long version for all interested. Both sections will have information to inform and protect the customer under one heading, and for future and any current unaware employees under another heading, with subheadings in bold for each point. If I miss anything, I may edit it to add more later. If you only want to read more detail about a specific point, scroll down to the same location in the long version. Please note that I use ‘we’ instead of ‘they’ as I am a writing from the ‘inside’, but I do not condone nor engage in any of the unlawful or immoral behavior listed (hence I am finally whistleblowing and getting the f\*ck out of this company). Also note I speak from experience in the stores I have visited/worked at, and some information may generalized for advice purposes.

​

\----------------------------------------------------------------------------

# THE SHORT VERSION

**CUSTOMERS**

Be warned and fully aware of these main points:

​

\***Price Drop Protection** – no, you are not ‘protected’. We do not have a system to monitor price ‘changes’ for you.

\***The Captain’s Package** – this is a last attempt to charge you for already-free services (eg 24 hr support), or to trick you into thinking you get free credit for nothing.

\***Deposits to hold flights/hotels** – no, this is** not refundable, and no, we do not save the price for yo**u at all, and may even lie to you to charge you more for the same booking later if you do not pay upfront.

\***Personal/Contact details** – we go through our databases and sign you up to newsletters without your consent even if you previously said ‘no’.

\***Deceptive deal pricing** – ‘from $99’! This is one flight/hotel room, just a few days in the whole year, and has been booked out since last month. But the pricing will stay advertised that way.

\***Price Mark-ups** – yes, we do this to your flights, hotels, insurance, car rentals, anything. Flight Centre made a media statement claiming to have a team that monitors markups – this is the first time that I or my fellow consultants had heard such a claim.

\***Involuntary consultant switches** – you may be told the consultant you want is not there, when they actually are – this is because the consultant you\* ar\*e speaking to may be attempting to steal the sale.

\***Drinking on the job,**** on the cloc**k – there is a very real chance the consultant you are speaking to in-store or over the phone is intoxicated.

\***Vulnerable customers** – we are trained to take advantage of your grief. You are an easy target.

\***Profiting off of contract errors** – If you sign anything that had our errors in it, we may wait until your signature then slam you with rebooking fees when you finally notice the error later.

\***Airline favouritism** – we will switch-sell you to specific airlines when an airline is running an incentive for us, even if there is zero benefit to you and even if the new flights are at a worse time or cost a lot more.

\***Tour operator favouritism** – consultants will attempt to push specific tour operators which pay higher commissions or are running incentives (sell 8, go on a free trip) even if the trip may not be right for you.

​

​

**FOR FUTURE APPLICANTS AND NEW EMPLOYEES (AND FOR CONCERNED PARENTS)**

Be aware of this before you apply, or now that you have joined the company:

​

\***Salary** – You are paid below minimum wage.

\***Commission** – you are taxed triple on any commission you make, and this is kept secret until noticed.

\***Hours** – expect at least 2 hours of unpaid overtime each day. Meetings and events are unpaid and outside of contract hours, but you will be disciplined for not coming.

\***On-target earnings** – To earn on-target you need to either mark-up ridiculously or put in crazy overtime and sell on our days off.

\***Consecutive working days** – you can be forced to work 9+ days consecutively. Know your rights.

\***Loss of commission even if FC profits** – we cannot reject price matches, but the consultant wears it and FC still profits off of the sale.

\***FC prices way above market** – this ensures that either you fight to sell the marked up price and FC profits while you make zero profit yourself, or that you sell at market price and wear the ‘loss’.

\***Ticketing fee** – The consultant must pay $20-$28 from their pooled commission on top of each ticket they sell, on top of the price in our system, to create that ticket. This is an internal Flight Cenre fee that we are made to pay for Flight Centre’s operations.

\***Big Brother is watching** – you are monitored by managers and all staff around us, harassed twice a day, and also have to report on fellow consultants daily as one part of our job. The daily guilt trips are horrible.

\***Errors** – technically you don’t wear any errors your first 6 months, but we’ll still try to see if you will wear them unknowingly

\***Stolen bookings** – other consultants may lie about your whereabouts in order to steal your sale.

\***Sexual harassment** – eg, we are forced to go on-stage in our first month and, in front of 300 people, create a porn star name for ourselves.

\***Booze culture** – we are pressured into unpaid alcohol fueled ‘buzz nights’ once a month which go for 3+ hours, and guilted if we do not go. Recently they’ve started charging us money if we don’t go.

\***On the job drinking** – this is real, and common. Staff rooms are stocked with both spirits and alcopops/mixed drinks, and managers encourage on the clock drinking several times a month.

\***Bullying** \- oh yes, it does happen and it's all hidden or played off as jokes. Sometimes it is event done in front of customers, whose complaints about it go unheard.

​

​

# THE LONG VERSION

**CUSTOMERS**

Be warned and fully aware of these main points:

​

\***Price Drop Protection** – this promises that if the price drops for the same exact flights you paid for, you get a voucher with the difference back. Sounds great – to anyone uninformed. What we are taught is to not explain this in full detail, no terms and conditions unless explicitly asked. You, as the customer, should be aware of the below:

\-You are responsible for monitoring the price changes, not us.

\-We do not check daily (or at all) for you, and we do not have any system to alert us of price going lower. I, myself, checked daily out of the horrible guilt I felt.

\-If the price drops, we have no responsibility to tell you.

\-If you see the price has dropped, you must collect evidence and provide it to us in order for us to assess it.

\-If you purchased price drop protection, the chances are the price online is already lower since marking-up is common and there is a high chance you paid a marked-up price.

\-Price Drop Protection can only be claimed once.

\-This is a tool for consultants to squeeze commission from you.

\-This is rarely claimed as prices tend to mostly go up, and quite moot when it comes to already-cheap flights (pay $49 for protection, but the flights might only go down $30). However, in the very rare case a business class flight price drops, the difference could b $500+.

\-Be weary of consultants selling you Price Drop Protection on sale flights. That’s the lowest they can already go.

\*\*-\*\*Be weary of consultants selling you Price Drop Protection on flights that were customized, as you cannot check online for price drops, rendering this ‘protection’ unusable.

\***The Captain’s Package** – the following outlines what is included and how it is a tool for pure profit. Features:

\-Price Drop Protection – as above.

\-24/7 Worldwide Care – this is the already free call centre offered to all customers whether or not they buy this package. Do not believe consultants trying to sell this as a premium service.

\-Transferable deposit – as above, this is also an already free service for all customers, regardless of whether you get the Captain’s Package or not.

\-Next Day Business Refund – technically, it does not cost us anything to get the refund to you quickly, but buying this Captain’s Package makes us liable to actually do it.

\-Visa and Passport check – there are guidelines that require us to check all visas and passports, regardless of you purchasing the Captain’s Package. This is an already free service.

\-$100 travel insurance excess rebate – we’ll pay the first $100 of one of your claims, but the insurance has to be with our partner Covermore, bought through us.

\***Deposits to hold flights/hotels** – This is a tricky one, but a method to hook you in.

New consultants will tell you that we are holding the price and seats for you. When you sign the contract to make a deposit, you might notice the words ‘nothing is booked in and no prices are guaranteed.’ If you don’t notice those words and call the consultant out on it, it’s your loss. Standard contract stuff, but very important.

Older consultants may tell you that the pricing is subject to change without notice due to airline decisions. So, what does your deposit actually do? It holds in the seats and fare class for you until the airline’s deadline (could be same-day, could be a month away). What this means is that the fare pricing (excluding taxes) technically should not change without prior warning from the airline – which the consultant has to be checking and has to inform you about so you have a chance to make a decision. However, let’s say a few days have passed since your deposit. You come in to pay off the rest. The consultant can pull a fast one on you, telling you ‘The prices were *suddenly* pulled by the airline, so please pay $300 more for the new ticket.’ The truth is, the price are probably the same, or there was prior warning, but you signed the contract accepting that nothing is a guaranteed so now you either pay the new price, move the deposit to other flights that may be cheaper or let FC keep the deposit for a future booking (legally we have to hold it for several years for you). We do not refund the deposit.

\***Personal/Contact details** – We do our best to collect as many contact details from you as possible when you first come into the store. We are trained to push at least 3 times, to a level of complete discomfort for both us and you, and are guilt-tripped and blamed if you do not give us enough information. We have a target for how many people we sign up to the mailing list, and especially as of recently we are being forced to sign you up without your knowledge or consent. The other day, we were told to go through all customers we’ve dealt with and change their marketing preferences from ‘no’ to ‘yes’, meaning we were forced to sign up everyone that has ever come into contact with us, even if they specifically requested not to receive marketing emails, etc.

\***Deceptive deal pricing** – You will often see unbelievable pricing on our website and on store windows. There is a high chance this pricing is not available, and has not been available for quite some time. So, what are the legalities of it? You’ll notice the word ‘From’ next to most, if not all, pricing we advertise. In very small font, there will be very specific dates listed as well.

That covers people who would assume that the pricing is exactly that, and all-year-round. Well, what about the people who want to travel on those exact dates? Will the pricing be as advertised? Most likely not. Even if something has sold out, we will keep that pricing information up for as long as we can. What this results in is customers being mislead, and consultants having to talk their way out of conflict and then switch-selling. It’s a very risky type of marketing bait, but not uncommon.

\***Price Mark-ups** – Always check online first, because you are our piggy bank. While some of us genuinely care about you and want to give you a good deal because we have a conscience and can relate to you, the fact of the matter is that we have earnings targets and the pricing in our system is only just high enough for Flight Centre to profit if we do not markup enough for ourselves. When we give you pricing, there is a very real chance that we are playing a game with you. We’re throwing out higher pricing to test the waters. You react favourably, we’ll try to add more on, suggest ‘better’ flights that cost more, or add on extra fees which are inserted in the price of the flights/hotels/etc instead of outlined on the invoice as booking fees, which is against travel industry laws and standards. For those that will say ‘well, that’s how businesses operate!’, you are correct, but a part of this is morals. Customers come to Flight Centre to seek our help, we take advantage of their lack of knowledge to charge as we like rather than what is fair.

**In response to Flight Centre releasing a statement claiming we have an in-house team that monitor markups – I do apologise, but this was** **gold**. This is the first time that any of us consultants had heard such a claim. I wonder if they are referring to the dispute resolution call centre, in other words the only team handling markups is the one customers call in to make a serious complaint about being ripped off. I leave this open for discussion – perhaps other employees of FC can contribute, or FC can provide proof of a team existing before the ABC article dragged them through the dirt this week.

\***Involuntary consultant switches** – sometimes you may come looking for a specific consultant, perhaps your regular consultant. You may be told they are not there, when in fact they are in the staff room or on lunch. If you call, you may be told the consultant is not there, when in fact they are just a few seats over and not busy at all. This is an attempt by the person you are speaking to to steal the same and commission from that person – they are acting fully in their own interests. As a rule, they have to offer you a chance to wait for the consultant you actually wanted, or to book an appointment with them. But who can resist taking a giant booking that would help them hit their monthly target right away?

\***Drinking on the job,**** on the cloc**k – we have alcohol stocked up in the back room, and in our fridge, at all times. Managers or fellow coworkers will sometimes come in halfway through the day with packs of booze, saying ‘Today needs a pick-me-up!’ or ‘Guys, we’re having a slow day!’ as excuses. We will literally drink the alcohol in front of you – it will be hidden in the tea mugs, water bottles or takeaway coffee cups we drink as you are sitting with us, or as you are on the phone with us. We have been told it is legal to drink on the job at Flight Centre, and that there is nothing wrong with it.

\***Vulnerable customers** – death of a relative, illness in the family, depression, personal crisis, job loss, pension. We are trained to book flight and then push a vacation on you in your grief. We actually get in trouble if we do not sell you a complete vacation package for that flight you are taking to Sydney to say goodbye to your dying mother. Just because someone is dying doesn’t mean you can’t make the trip fun and memorable for yourself! While there is truth in that people may want to have an escape and it is not impossible to sell them more than what they originally asked for, we get guilt-tripped by those above us if we do not sell every single grieving person as much as we can possible squeeze out of them, especially since they are vulnerable and easier to mark things up on or convince to buy insurance with inclusions not even relevant to them.

\***Profiting off of contract errors** – We will sometimes make mistakes as consultants which are genuine human error. Other times, it is out of lack of care or interest, or pure exhaustion or laziness. Either way, it does not matter the second you put your signature on the contract and hand us the money. Anything you did not notice yourself at the time of booking is now something you will be slammed with change fees for. Additionally, it does not matter what we  explain or promise verbally, as the only proof of agreement is that contract. I was taught never to feel bad about my errors, and instead to rejoice as it mean that I could profit from charging the customer to make any changes or fixes. How do you avoid this? The simple answer is read every single term and condition. Anything promised by the consultant, you must request them to put in writing into the invoice. They cannot refuse to write down something they are promising – if they refuse, you know you’re being tricked because they’re trying to get out of any liability on their end.

\***Airline favouritism** – Airlines will often run incentives, such as paying consultants more commission per each ticket sold, or giving a free trip to the top selling consultant. For those of us that want these benefits, it can cloud judgement. You may come in wanting a Qantas flight, especially to collect Frequent Flyer points, and it may be the best price and flight time for you as well. Depending on the consultant, we will still work our butt off to convince you to choose Virgin. We may say the Qantas is sold out, we may try to look for faults in the Qantas fight. Anything. We are doing this to look out for ourselves more than look out for you.

\***Tour operator favouritism** – While we will not try to, for example, sell a Contiki tour to a 70 year old with a bad hip, we sure will push to sell specific tour operators over others when they are running incentives for us. You may want a cruise with P&amp;O, but for that specific month you came to see us we’ll tell you about how full of kids it is and anything else we can try to make up to make Princess Cruises look like the better option. So, what can you do when the ‘experts’ may be purposely biased? Check online for reviews.

​

**FOR FUTURE APPLICANTS AND NEW EMPLOYEES (AND FOR CONCERNED PARENTS)**

Be aware of this before you apply, or now that you have joined the company:

​

\***Salary** – In our presentation during the group interview, we will tell you that we pay you in-line with Australian award wage, but this is a nicely worded fairytale. Your monthly wage before commission is below minimum wage. Your monthly ‘top up’ is barely anything. Your commission? Read below.

\***Commission** – you are taxed around triple on any commission you make. This is not in any contracts. This is not taught in training. This was not known by any of the consultants I work with until a fellow consultant told us after going through their paychecks for the last several months and noticing she earned a total of $600 less than promised.

\***Hours** – We are rostered to work more hours each week than our actual contract. This is before overtime, meaning that already the contract is being breached. On top of that, there is daily unpaidovertime. Additionally, you will be pressured into out of office activities which are not in the contract nor paid for, and forced to come to daily unpaid morning meetings. Despite them not being in our contract, you will be disciplined for not coming (sometimes even forced to pay money for missing an event). We got told ‘I cannot legally ask you to come in before your contracted hours. However, you must have all your morning tasks done before our morning meeting.’ The tasks are all administration related tasks that must be done at the very start of the day, but we get in trouble for doing them during actual paid work hours. The meetings? When I first joined, I was told they’re useful gatherings to discuss strategies. I soon** found out through receiving disciplinary action that these daily morning meetings are compulsory despite being outside contract hours and unpai**d. In these 10+ hour work days, we only get 30 minutes for lunch. We are guilt tripped if we go for more than 30 minutes.

\***On-target earnings** –We are pressured into marking up everything to meet targets, ignoring the laws governing markups and transparency in the travel industry. It is impossible to earn on-target without either ridiculous mark-ups or ridiculous overtime and selling on our days off. There are two choices – work yourself to sickness trying to force-sell absolutely everything possible to each customer, despite their needs and budget, and make very minimal margin off of each thing,\*\* o\*\*r mark up and go home with half an hour of overtime per day instead of several hours.

\***Consecutive working days** – rosters are made by managers in-store with no guidelines that we are aware of, aside from their judgement. Know your rights. I have caught managers several times making rosters with 9+consecutive working days for some employees. If you don’t check, they get away with it and it becomes your fault.

\***Big Brother is watching** – we are monitored by managers and all staff around us, and also have to monitor everyone as part of our job. Managers harass us twice a day about earnings, all our actions, our whole schedule, and the names of all customers we are targeting that day, and command us to call those customers and speak to them in certain ways. The worst case was when I was asked who I had just spoken to on the phone as soon as I finished a call, and why I had not sold anything to them. When I explained ‘It was a customer who just called me to inform me her sister passed away in front of her,’ the response I received was ‘That’s not an excuse. Call her back – see if you can offer her that Philippines deal we have going so you can count it towards your goal for today. I don’t want you to go home today until you get a positive outcome from her.’

Additionally, consultants are required to listen in on others and submit reports twice daily. We listen to phone calls or face-to-face consults and grade fellow consultants – 1 to 2 per day, every single day – and then have to approach them and give feedback. Consider the fact that the majority of staff are not mature enough or lack the crucial coaching experience needed for this, and the discrepancy in service quality. There is a serious risk that consultants will talk down to each other, offend each other and overall just result in hostility and more guilt trips.

\***Errors** – if you make mistakes starting out due to poor training or misinformation, you are technically not liable for these errors in your first 6 months, but we will not tell you this and see if you try to wear it yourself.

\***Stolen bookings** – other consultants will sometimes tell customers looking for you that you are not there, in other to take your potential sale as their own or to upsell to your customer before you have the chance to. This may be in the form of them calling the store and the consultant saying you’re not in that day despite you sitting a few seats down, or even more desperately as saying that you are away when you’ve actually just ducked out to the back room or bathroom for a minute.

\***Sexual harassment** – this one’s an interesting one. You may have heard the news of how FC recently portrayed the ‘typical’ female employee – drunk off the rails, likely to black out, condoms in purse, whatever. All the free alcohol we get pushed on us creates breeding grounds for a lot of sexual activity, sexual harassment and who knows what else. I will leave this one as it can be interpreted in too many ways to have energy for.

\***Booze culture** – we are pressured into unpaid alcohol fueled ‘buzz nights’ once a month which go for 3+ hours, and guilted if we do not go. Recently they’ve started charging us money if we don’t go.

\***On the job drinking** – this is real, and common. Staff rooms are stocked with both spirits and alcopops/mixed drinks. Managers will encourage drinking on the clock some days and even bring in boxes of drinks, fellow consultants will encourage it other days. We hide it in teacups, water bottles, coffee cups, you name it.

\***Bullying** \- I could go on and on about with examples. One of my favourite ones was when several month ago, an employee announced they were looking to leave. The manager bent over backwards to convince the staff of their value, until this staff member made it clear they were quitting. From then on, they were completely ignore at all meetings, not even looked at, and in their last week they were made to sit in the back room all day each day. They were not allowed to speak to customers, not allowed to make sales to make money, and were treated with absolute hostility and aggression.

3,"I'm an intersex female. I know that sounds like a made up tumblr gender, but its not so AMA


Being ""intersex"" is just an umbrella term to describe a condition where your chromosomes and anatomy don't match. Like XX babies being born with testes, or being born with XXY chromosomes. I'm 20 years old, am XY chromosome but was born with no genitalia and raised as female. I have no male or female reproductive organs, so my body never began to produce testosterone so i don't appear male or transgender whatsoever, and i began taking estrogen patches at around 11 years old. I had reconstructive surgery when i was 15 to have a hole to be able to take a dick in and feel pleasure with, but i haven't dilated it wide enough yet to be able to have sex yet. That covers all the basics, so go ahead and AMA else."
